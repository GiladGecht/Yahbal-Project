JAIME PAZ ZAMORA, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Bolivia. \r\nMr. Jaime Paz Zamora. President of the Republic of Bolivia, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Bolivia, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jaime Paz Zamora, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident PAZ ZAMORA: I first had the honour of addressing the \r\nGeneral Assembly in September 1989, shortly after assuming the presidency of \r\nBolivia. I anticipated then that the vertiginous changes taking place in and \r\naround us would bear the hallmark of what I termed the revolution of \r\ndemocracy. \r\nToday, after all we have experienced in this brief but intense period, we \r\ncan see more clearly that the growth of universal awareness among men and \r\nwomen has not only given democracy, as a system, a global dimension for the \r\nfirst time in the history of mankind, but has also meant that its power for \r\nchange and its potential for transformation are clearly challenging old ideas, \r\nold structures and old habits. \r\nI will say without fear of contradiction if I may be permitted to \r\nparaphrase what someone has said that democracy is racing round the globe, \r\nno longer a phantasmal newcomer but rather a wind of renewal and hope. \r\nAccordingly, what we must now surely call global democracy is shedding \r\nnew light on old truths, leading us to understand better, for example, that \r\npower is, by definition, something to be shared; that we need a new and better \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n3 -\r\n(President Paz Zamora) \r\nunderstanding of the dynamics of consensus and dissent; and that the various \r\nforms of intermediation necessary for social life are now in crisis. \r\nIndeed, the more complex the organizational processes of a particular \r\ngovernment, as is the case in democracy, the greater the need for that power \r\nto be shared if we wish to see it adequately maintained and developed. By the \r\nsame token, the more rudimentary and simple power is, as is the case in \r\nauthoritarianism and dictatorship, the less evident is the necessity of \r\nsharing power. \r\nSimilarly, we can now see that the useful consensus on the basis of which \r\nthe old democracies of the industrialized countries were built, with \r\ngovernment and opposition thinking and acting virtually in the same way, seems \r\nto citizens a worn-out mechanism that hampers change. Paradoxically, at the \r\nopposite pole, in the young democracies of developing countries, the citizenry \r\nzealously calls for consensus as an essential means of uniting the nation\u0027s \r\nforces in pursuit of indispensable changes. \r\nIt would seem, then, that where the art of consensus was perfected, the \r\nneed is arising to learn how to manage dissent in an appropriate way; and \r\nwhere dissent had become a way of life and a cause of stagnation, there is a \r\nneed in turn to learn how to build consensus. This could well be described as \r\nthe dynamics of consensus and dissent under democracy. \r\nAs to the forms of intermediation to be found in social life, we also see \r\nthat the citizens of universal democracy are striving to reduce intermediacy, \r\nstriving to take the initiative in everyday life in a more direct way. It is \r\nthen that the citizen comes to regard intermediation as something of his own \r\nthat is inescapable, genuine, close, efficient, transparent and \r\nrepresentative. Therefore, we should not be surprised today to find a state \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n4 \r\n(President Paz Zamora) \r\nof crisis in the political, religious, trade-union and cultural forms of \r\nintermediation, and even in that great intermediator, the State itself. \r\nThis last point is especially useful and relevant as we turn to an \r\nexamination of the present state of our Organization, for, in our view, what \r\nhas come to be called the crisis of the United Nations seems to be in essence \r\nnothing other than a crisis of intermediation. I say this because in fact we \r\nhave always thought that the United Nations represents the most advanced \r\nmechanism of intermediation on Earth but that, in order to continue to be \r\nsuch, it must adapt itself to the newly emerging global scenarios of the \r\nrevolution of democracy. \r\nFor nearly half a century after its inception, the United Nations played \r\nthe privileged role of intermediary during the era of hegemonic blocs and the \r\ncold war. That indicated the quantity and quality of intermediation possible \r\nwithin that context, at the same time creating a way of sharing international \r\npower and a method of managing the dynamics of consensus and dissent, within \r\nthe prevailing balance, managing in that context to determine even its own \r\nstructure, organization and functioning. Under that old order, the United \r\nNations achieved great credibility. And although in many places peace was not \r\nalways preserved, the Organization achieved something that appeared \r\nimpossible: prevention of a nuclear conflagration between opposing and \r\nseemingly irreconcilable blocs. \r\nBut things have changed dramatically and, with them, so must our \r\nOrganization. In saying this I believe I am voicing what all of us in the \r\nAssembly are thinking. It is clear that the new world order needs new \r\ncredibility, which the United Nations must earn. The citizens and nations of \r\nglobal democracy are placing unavoidable challenges before our Organization, \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n5 \r\n(President Paz Zamora\u0027, \r\nchallenges that reguire us to adapt its structures, modernize its machinery \r\nand identify new priorities and thus the new intermediation that is possible \r\nin terms of quantity and quality. And, with no other aim in mind than that of \r\nseeking answers, allow me to illustrate these ideas by describing a few \r\nselected developments which, in addition to being new, have the common feature \r\nof having gained global proportions, which makes them particularly deserving \r\nof the Organization\u0027s keenest attention. \r\nThe first of these is what I would describe as the dialectic of the \r\nuniversal and the particular, or, alternatively, the dialectic of \r\nuniversalisms and particularisms. I am referring to the obvious fact that \r\npeoples today are expressing two attitudes that are seemingly contradictory \r\nbut are none the less part of the same dynamic. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n6 \r\n(President Paz Zamora) \r\nOn the one hand they are striving for complementarity through processes \r\nof integration that are laying out ever broader geographical, political, \r\neconomic and commercial areas that already constitute a new world geography. \r\nOn the other hand, simultaneously and paradoxically, those same peoples and \r\ncitizens are reaffirming their identity and their essence, sometimes \r\nintransigently demanding their own cultural, historic, religious, and \r\nimmediate political frameworks. In an apparent contradiction, they seem to be \r\ntrying to experience, simultaneously and complementarily, the great and the \r\nsmall, the longer-term and the immediate, the universal and the particular. \r\nThe second of these developments arises from the fact that the market \r\neconomy has gained ascendancy in the same manner as democracy and, together \r\nwith them, the awareness of a better life and the need for well-being and \r\nhuman and social development have also become global. Consequently, we face \r\nas never before the urgent need for a form of solidarity that will enable us \r\nto hit upon an appropriate relationship between the market economy, democracy, \r\nand human development. That solidarity, by emphasizing social development \r\nand, for many of our countries, in a frontal assault upon poverty, will enable \r\nus also to redefine the foundations of new social legitimacy for States, \r\ninternally and internationally. \r\nThe third development has to do with something that we agreed upon at the \r\nrecent Conference in Rio de Janeiro. We live in a single global ecosystem and \r\nwe are all jointly responsible for its conservation and clean-up. We also \r\nagreed that little purpose would be served by preserving a world to be \r\ninhabited by an impoverished human race, which clearly implies that the \r\necological stewardship of the planet does not rur counter to our peoples\u0027 \r\nneeds for development. Consequently, it remains for us promptly to endow the \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n7 \r\n(President Paz Zamora) \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development with the resources, powers and machinery \r\nit will need to fulfil the objectives we have set for ourselves. That means \r\nimplementing Agenda 21, a true plan of action for the next century, as a point \r\nof departure for offsetting the historical environmental debt we have spoken \r\nof in other forums. \r\nThe fourth development pertains to technology. In the joint \r\ndeliberations the Presidents of the Ibero-American countries engaged in to \r\nmark the Quincentennial of 1492, we concluded that the final explanation for \r\nall colonial processes is to be found in a confrontation in which the winner \r\nachieves ascendancy by virtue of his technological superiority, and that this \r\nfirst technological defeat lies at the root of dependency and \r\nmarginalization. We then agreed that in order to redress that situation it \r\nwas necessary to share technological power more democratically, and that one \r\nappropriate way to do so might well be to declare as the common heritage of \r\nmankind those basic technologies that are indispensable to satisfy adequately \r\nthe equally basic rights of mankind: health, nutrition, education and \r\nhousing. I venture to reiterate that initiative before the Assembly with an \r\nexplicit proposal by Bolivia to the international community that we should \r\nseek participatory, creative and markedly personal machinery that would become \r\nthe main thrust of the work of the social summit we should now convene. \r\nThe fifth, and last, development I wish to bring to the attention of the \r\nAssembly relates to a right which is already recognized under Article 19 of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights of our Organization, which states \r\nthat everyone has the right to \r\n\"seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and \r\nregardless of frontiers.\" (resolution 217 (III). Article 19) \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n8 \r\n(President Paz Zamora) \r\nRepresentatives will surely agree that in recent decades technology has \r\nturned information, too, into a phenomenon of equally global proportions. At \r\nthe same time, the universal revolution of democracy has instilled an \r\nunprecedented awareness among citizens of their right to inform and be \r\ninformed. That growing awareness is in turn linked to the observable fact \r\nthat the gap now separating the well-informed citizen from the poorly informed \r\ncitizen seems quantitatively and qualitatively greater, or at least equal to, \r\nthat other gap separating extremes of wealth and poverty. \r\nAll of this leads us, in modern terms, to the perception that information \r\nhas become the Gordian knot or, if you wish, the crossroads of human rights. \r\nIndeed, although it may appear an arbitrary simplification, the \r\nbetter-informed citizen eats more and better than the citizen who is not \r\nwell-informed and has greater opportunities, among other things, to obtain \r\naccess to better health and education. The problem becomes all the more acute \r\nwhen, as mentioned earlier, information today has become a phenomenon that is \r\nincreasingly dependent on advanced technology and, conseguently, the exercise \r\nof the right conferred by the aforementioned Article 19 of the Declaration \r\nreally depends on each citizen\u0027s greater or lesser opportunity to have access \r\nto technology on an egual footing. \r\nI believe that a matter of such great importance requires special \r\ntreatment and attention on the part of our Organization. With that in mind, \r\nit seems most appropriate to suggest that serious and urgent consideration be \r\ngiven to the inclusion as a central focus of the World Conference on Human \r\nRights in 1993 the topic of citizens\u0027 information. I say \"citizens\u0027\" \r\ninformation because I am not referring to that other matter, relating more to \r\ninformation among nations, which came to be known as the \"new international \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n9-10 \r\n(President Paz Zamora) \r\ninformation order\". Rather, I am referring to the citizens\u0027 right to \r\ninformation and to the urgent need to guarantee, in principle and in reality, \r\nequality for mankind with regard to information. \r\nI wish to share with the Assembly my impression that, if we keep up with \r\nhistory in moving along this road, we will be arming mankind against what \r\nmight be the most serious threat to democracy: the new authoritarianism, or, \r\nif you prefer, the great dictatorship of the twenty-first century - the \r\nperverse, systematic, sophisticated, invisible and elusive subjugation of the \r\ncitizens to the distorted and monopolistic control of information technology. \r\nAllow me now to devote a few moments of my statement to recent \r\ndevelopments in my country. The curtain has just fallen on a period which is \r\nnow gone, perhaps never to return. In my country, the signs of new times are \r\nmuch more visible than in other regions. Members here have themselves often \r\nexpressed that judgment and often urged and encouraged the efforts of my \r\npeople, who may now take pride in achievements that have impressed sceptics \r\nand enlightened those whose minds were weighed down by the weary logic of the \r\npast. \r\nBolivia is a nation at peace, and, collectively and individually, it is \r\nperhaps one of the safest on the continent. It has consolidated its \r\ndemocratic system and is making concordance the basic instrument of its \r\npolitical endeavours. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n11 \r\n(President Paz Zamora) \r\nOn 9 July, all my country\u0027s political parties Government and \r\nopposition, right and left made a solemn commitment to carry forward in the \r\ncoming months the basic tasks of modernizing the State and society through \r\njudicial, electoral and educational reforms, reforms in the administrative and \r\npolitical machinery and, finally, reforms in the Constitution itself. \r\nHow encouraging it is to have left behind the Bolivia of factionalism, \r\none of the nightmares of the twentieth century, and to be entering the \r\ntwenty-first century free of those shackles. \r\nWe have built, first, financial stability and, then, growth. To do this, \r\nit was necessary to face squarely the need to carry out the in-depth reform \r\nand modernization of the economic system. That reform stands on four \r\nfoundations: stimulating competitiveness in the economy and freeing it from \r\ntariff barriers, subsidies and State protection; expanding the scope for \r\nprivate initiative in order to achieve the broadest citizen participation in \r\neconomic growth; stimulating investment, generating employment and extending \r\nthe benefits of development to the majority of Bolivians; and transforming the \r\nState into an efficient manager respectful of solidarity, and into the main \r\nparty responsible for infrastructure and human development. \r\nIn this way, and based on the wisdom and capabilities of its people, \r\nBolivia has achieved the lowest rates of inflation in South America in the \r\nlast three years. At the same time, its growth rate was one of the highest in \r\nthe region, and per capita income has grown systematically during my \r\nAdministration. \r\nAll of this has brought us to a time of happiness and harmony. For the \r\nfirst time in my country\u0027s contemporary history, there are more Bolivians \r\ncoming back than leaving, and more money flowing in than flowing out of \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n12 \r\n(President Paz Zamora) \r\nBolivia. Never before has so much been invested in health, education and \r\nbasic sanitation, simply because we have never had as much access as we have \r\ntoday to concessional resources, which are coming to Bolivia thanks to the \r\ninternational community\u0027s confidence in the responsible way in which my \r\ncountry is being governed. We are building an optimistic Bolivia, a Bolivia \r\nwith a future and with international stature. \r\nWhile Bolivia is a country which reaches the Atlantic through the major \r\nwatercourses of the Amazon and the Rio de la Plata, it is by history, \r\ngeography and culture a country of the Pacific Ocean. There is no better \r\nplace than this forum of peace for me to reiterate that an unjust war deprived \r\nus of the status of a maritime nation, in which our life as a republic began, \r\nand thereby turned Bolivia into a country without a seacoast. The Bolivian \r\npeople will never give up its aspiration to the sea and to a sovereign and \r\nuseful presence on the Pacific coast. It matters not how much effort and \r\nsacrifice may be required in pursuit of that objective. \r\nTo this end, we have laid out a strategy of peace and integration, a \r\ngradual and pragmatic strategy by which an appropriate solution to Bolivia\u0027s \r\nlandlocked situation can be found that could be generally and mutually \r\nbeneficial to the countries of the region. Proof of the soundness and impact \r\nof that strategy is the outcome of the Mariscal de Santa Cruz agreements \r\nsigned with Peru on 24 January in the southern city of Ilo. Although not \r\nencompassing the sovereignty to which we aspired, and although not in the \r\nlocation which historically is rightfully ours, agreement has been reached on \r\na commercial and industrial duty-free zone and on administration of the port \r\nby Bolivian and Peruvian entrepreneurs. Moreover, a tourism area of \r\n5 kilometres of beach has been granted, and it has already been named \r\n\"Boliviamar\". \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n13 \r\n(President Paz Zamora) \r\nThree years ago I described to the Assembly Bolivia\u0027s national strategy \r\nto fight the production of, trafficking in and illicit consumption of \r\nnarcotics, a strategy which my Government was then beginning to implement, \r\nasking the international community for its understanding and support. In 1989 \r\nthere were reasons to fear that drug trafficking might irremediably corrode \r\nthe political and institutional system of Bolivia, that it might come to \r\ndominate the economy as a whole and might lead, sooner or later, to escalating \r\nviolence. Although at that time there were doubts as to Bolivia\u0027s ability to \r\ncarry out the plan, today I can say categorically that cocaine traffic has \r\nceased to be a strategic risk for Bolivia. \r\nBolivia is proof that the struggle against drug trafficking not only is \r\npossible but can also be successful. Against the temptation to yield to \r\ndiscouragement and pessimism, Bolivia stands out as a symbol, as a banner of \r\nhope and optimism. We have systematically reduced the areas devoted to coca \r\ngrowing; we have reduced the production of paste and cocaine hydrochloride; we \r\nhave taken firm action in the selection of specialized personnel, following \r\ncriteria of efficiency and honesty; and we have broken up the main networks of \r\ndrug trafficking in Bolivia by means of a decree-law known as the \"Repentance \r\nDecree\", as a result of which the leaders of these organizations are now in my \r\ncountry\u0027s jails. \r\nAll this was possible because we managed to avoid the imposition from \r\noutside of concepts and plans ill-suited to our national reality. On the \r\ncontrary, we forged ahead with a peaceful struggle, ruling out the \r\nmilitarization of the struggle and spared the country from the confrontation \r\nand violence which had occurred elsewhere. In the light of this unquestionably \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n14-15 \r\n(President Paz Zamora) \r\npositive picture, Bolivia asks the international community to redouble its \r\nefforts to reduce consumption, to control chemical precursors and to increase \r\nquantitatively and qualitatively the resources allocated to improved \r\nfunctioning of alternative development mechanisms, Bolivia\u0027s substantive \r\ncontribution to the body of knowledge on this topic. \r\nAbove all, we ask most earnestly that the coca leaf not be confused with \r\ncocaine: the coca leaf is a good thing and is an expression of an age-old \r\ncultural tradition originating in the Andes; cocaine, by contrast, is foreign, \r\nalien, and came from outside. \r\nFrom this rostrum, I pay a tribute to all the Bolivians who made possible \r\nthe enormous advances we have achieved in this fight against one of the \r\ncruelest and most pernicious forms of corruption in contemporary society. I \r\nwish to express my special thanks to the self-sacrificing workers and farmers \r\nof my country. \r\nTomorrow, at the offices of the Interamerican Development Bank in \r\nWashington, intergovernmental meetings will begin with a view to defining the \r\ncomposition of the governing board of the Development Fund for Indigenous \r\nPeoples of Latin America and the Caribbean, created on the initiative of the \r\nIbero-American countries meeting at the Guadalajara and Madrid summits. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n16 \r\n(President Paz Zamora) \r\nBolivia, a country of original indigenous stock, like so many others of \r\nour continent, asks the international community to support this programme, \r\nwhich is vital for the lives of many men and women, especially as we prepare \r\nto celebrate 1993 as the International Year for the World\u0027s Indigenous People \r\nwith the theme of \"Indigenous people a new partnership\". \r\nThis is the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. But for the \r\npeoples of the Americas, and in particular the Ibero-American peoples, this \r\nsession marks the quincentennial of 1492. It is therefore a psychological \r\nreality for us that one chapter of history is drawing to a close and another \r\nis opening, one in which mankind will continue its tireless search, \r\ndiscovering and building new worlds. \r\nThat is why Bolivia, a peaceful country of the South, which is \r\nexperiencing the profound challenges of development, is also concerned about \r\nthe fate of the industrialized North, where, following the natural euphoria \r\nafter the end of the cold war and the victory of democracy, there have been \r\nworrying signs of uncertainty, lack of confidence and pessimism. I say I am \r\nconcerned about the North because, in contrast with the past, we are now all \r\nliving in one global political ecosystem, where threats, risks, victories and \r\nfailures have repercussions for us all. \r\nFor its part, Bolivia is prepared, together with other countries, to run \r\nthe shared risk of building a new and better world. In that endeavour, there \r\nis only one requirement: that no one ignore anyone else. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Bolivia for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Jaime Paz Zamora. President of the Republic of Bolivia, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n17 \r\nADDRESS BY CAPTAIN VALENTINE E. M. STRASSER, CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL \r\nPROVISIONAL RULING COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nChairman of the National Provisional Ruling Council of the Republic of Sierra \r\nLeone. \r\nCaptain Valentine E. M. Strasser. Chairman of the National Provisional \r\nRuling Council of the Republic of Sierra Leone, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the Chairman of the National Provisional \r\nRuling Council of the Republic of Sierra Leone, His Excellency \r\nCaptain Valentine E. M. Strasser, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\nChairman STRASSER: It is with a deep sense of humility that I \r\nascend this rostrum and bring the greetings and best wishes of the people of \r\nSierra Leone as we approach the close of one of the most momentous years in \r\nour recent history. \r\nPermit me to convey to you. Sir, warm felicitations on your election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your \r\nelection is a tribute to your country and a testimony to its faith in this \r\nOrganization and all that it stands for. I wish you success in the \r\nperformance of your duties. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n18-20 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nThe year 1992 has witnessed the accession to membership of our \r\nOrganization of a record number of States, 13, thus bringing closer the \r\nattainment of the goal of universality envisaged in the Charter. To all these \r\nnew Members, Sierra Leone extends a warm hand of welcome and friendship, \r\nfeeling sure that together we shall cooperate in forging a new era of peace \r\nand progress and a better life for all the peoples of the world. \r\nJB/8/1312 A/47/PV.9 \r\n21 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nSince Sierra Leone was admitted as the hundredth Member of this \r\nOrganization some 30 years ago, we have come to regard this Organization as \r\nthe custodian of international peace and security and as a bastion for the \r\ndefence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of all States, and \r\nparticularly small States such as ours. At the same time, this Organization \r\nhas not failed to deploy yeoman\u0027s efforts in solving the many international \r\nproblems of an economic, social, cultural, and humanitarian character which \r\ncontinue to plague us. In spite of all that may have been said and done, the \r\nUnited Nations in the course of its relatively short history has not only \r\ncontributed to preventing the nightmare of a nuclear war but also made an \r\ninvaluable contribution towards eliminating those other scourges that have \r\nafflicted mankind since time immemorial and continue to afflict it still. \r\nSierra Leone is indeed very grateful for the unstinting all-round support \r\nit has received from this Organization and its specialized agencies in \r\nconfronting these problems. I wish once again to pay a tribute to all those \r\nnoble men and women who in the name of the United Nations and its agencies \r\nhave participated in the socio-economic development of our country, in the \r\neradication of diseases, in caring for the needs of our children and giving \r\nhelp and succour to our refugees and displaced persons. Sierra Leone owes a \r\ndebt of gratitude to them all. \r\nRegrettably, the problems of poverty and underdevelopment have continued \r\nto have a direct bearing on our country. It is also a matter of regret that, \r\ndespite the assistance received from this Organization over the years. Sierra \r\nLeone has not registered the necessary economic growth and development that \r\nshould have brought about a fundamental and meaningful improvement in the \r\nstandard of living of its people. The past 24 years have witnessed a decline \r\nin the socio-economic fabric of our nation, resulting in tremendous hardship \r\nJB/8/1312 A/47/PV.9 \r\n22 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nand suffering for our people. Though the reasons for this are manifold and \r\ncomplex, in the case of our country, however, one of the principal causes has \r\nbeen a succession of bad Governments that conspired against our people and \r\nneglected their welfare, and that when not sharing the national wealth among \r\nthemselves conspired with foreign elements to dispose of our natural resources \r\nat give-away prices, thereby depriving Sierra Leoneans of an improved standard \r\nof living and reducing them to second-class citizens in their own God-given \r\nland. \r\nAmid this nightmarish experience. Sierra Leoneans wondered what really \r\nhad gone wrong with their country, endowed as it is with rich natural and \r\nhuman resources alike, a country that was once referred to as the \"Athens of \r\nWest Africa\", given its rich educational and cultural heritage. Over the last \r\n24 years. Sierra Leone experienced such a far-reaching decline in its \r\nsocio-economic fabric that the average life expectancy of Sierra Leoneans was \r\nreduced to a mere 42 years, with one in four children dying before the age of \r\nfive owing to malnutrition and other diseases; with vital surgical operations \r\ncarried out in constant fear of a breakdown of the electricity supply; with \r\nteachers forced frequently to withdraw their services for non-payment of \r\nsalaries and trying to eke out a living other than by teaching; with the \r\ncapital city itself in perennial darkness for years because the Government had \r\nfailed to make provision for electricity supply. All this led to the \r\nconcomitant and inexorable decline in the national production and the standard \r\nof living of our fellow countrymen. \r\nWhile the external factors contributing to this decline cannot be denied, \r\nthe truth of the matter is that the incompetence and malpractices of the \r\nprevious Government had so permeated all facets of national life that the \r\nnation was left to drift without any sense of direction. Thus, instead of \r\nJB/8/1312 A/47/PV.9 \r\n23-25 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\neconomic development, there was a national slide into poverty and economic \r\nmalaise. It was as if the light had gone out of the nation\u0027s life with no \r\none in charge to rekindle it. \r\nAs if that were not enough, as members are aware, last year, as a result \r\nof the civil war which had been raging in Liberia, at a time when Liberians \r\nhad turned against each other, engaging themselves in an orgy of massacre, the \r\npeople of Sierra Leone opened their homes and schools to them and offered them \r\nsanctuary. In order to end the killings and conseguent suffering which they \r\nhad to endure, and in the absence of any semblance of government in that \r\ncountry, the States of the sub-region, including Sierra Leone, with great \r\nreluctance and purely on humanitarian grounds, decided to send a peace-keeping \r\nforce the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to Liberia to stop \r\nthe carnage and bring the fighting among the various factions to an end. \r\nIt was because Sierra Leone provided a base for the ECOMOG peace-keeping \r\nforce in Liberia that Mr. Charles Taylor and his band of NPFL rebels launched \r\na premeditated and unwarranted invasion against our country. This senseless \r\nact of revenge was also motivated by the fact that Taylor had been denied the \r\nuse of our territory to infiltrate arms and ammunition to prolong the conflict \r\nin Liberia. Thus, because we allowed our country to be used to bring peace to \r\nLiberia, we now have a war imposed on us. \r\nIn the course of this act of perfidy, many innocent lives, including \r\nthose of women and children, have been needlessly lost. The national economy \r\nhas been laid to ruin, as no meaningful agricultural and mining activities \r\ncould be undertaken in the areas of rebel activity. The cost of this imposed \r\nwar for Sierra Leone and its people has been incalculable and agonizing. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n26 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nAs the custodian of international peace and security, this Organization \r\ncannot sit idly by while a group of armed bandits, let loose as a result of \r\nthe total breakdown of law and order in a neighbouring State, continues to \r\nengage in a campaign of terror and destabilization of the whole subregion. On \r\nbehalf of the people of Sierra Leone, I strongly appeal to this body for its \r\neconomic, military and diplomatic support to eliminate this cancer once and \r\nfor all. If this is not done, there could be further destabilization and \r\ninsecurity in the whole subregion. The Government and people of Sierra Leone \r\nexpect and deserve such support, especially when facing mortal danger launched \r\nfrom without. We hold Charles Taylor responsible for the suffering Sierra \r\nLeoneans have had to endure as a result of his acts of murder, banditry and \r\ninternational lawlessness. \r\nMy country need not have been left so exposed and so unprepared for such \r\nacts of aggression, our people need not have suffered such an ordeal, if only \r\nthe previous government had taken its responsibilities seriously; if only the \r\nnecessary material and logistical support had been provided for the armed \r\nforces to repel such aggression. The previous regime again failed to meet \r\nthis challenge. \r\nNot only did the previous Government breach its social contract with the \r\npeople and neglect their welfare, but it also failed to safeguard the \r\nterritorial integrity of the nation. These factors impelled us, as patriots \r\nin the armed forces, to intervene in a bloodless takeover on 29 April this \r\nyear and set up the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) to save our \r\nnation from further catastrophe. Herein lies the legitimacy of our action. \r\nWe intervened because we saw no way out of our affliction, no future to match \r\nthe sacrifice that people had been asked to make over many years. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n27 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nIn assuming so onerous a responsibility, my colleagues and I had no \r\npersonal ambition to assume power for its own sake. We saw it as our \r\npatriotic duty to take bold and forthright action to save our beloved country \r\nfrom the political, economic, social and moral decline that had overwhelmed \r\nit. As patriots, we felt we could not stand idly by and watch the total \r\ncollapse of our nation. We had to act to put our country back on the road of \r\nsocio-economic development and to restore its moral fibre. \r\nOurs was a very popular move, a case of unrepentant patriotism, as \r\nevidenced by the mass support we received then and continue to receive today. \r\nBy our action, our fellow citizens have once more found strength and \r\ninspiration. Once more, the light in them has begun to glow and the fire to \r\nbe rekindled. \r\nNotwithstanding such popular approval and the efforts we have exerted to \r\nrehabilitate and reconstruct the socio-economic fabric of our nation, let me \r\ndeclare from this rostrum that the government of the National Ruling \r\nProvisional Council has not come to stay in power. In the several decrees and \r\nproclamations issued since we assumed management of the affairs of the nation, \r\nwe made our intentions and objectives quite clear. They remain the same: \r\nfirst, to bring to an end the rebel war imposed on our country and to \r\nrehabilitate the devastated war areas; secondly, to put our country\u0027s \r\nbeleaguered economy on a sound and solid foundation; thirdly, to take all \r\nmeasures necessary for the recovery of all financial resources lawfully \r\nbelonging to the Government; and finally, to relaunch the democratic process \r\non a just, fair and lasting basis. \r\nWith regard to the Liberian rebel invasion, my Government is employing \r\nall the resources at its disposal to ensure that our gallant soldiers, who are \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n28 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\ndefending the nation at the war front, carry out their duties in the proper \r\nspirit and atmosphere. Not only are the proper logistics being provided for \r\nthem, but their material welfare is being assured as well. \r\nBut alas, against a weak economy such as ours and facing an aggressor \r\nthat receives armed support from a country in our continent, which sees it as \r\nits mission to carry out revolutionary warfare and create instability in the \r\nvarious regions of our continent and beyond in the name of revolutionary \r\nideals, my country should not be left alone to face such foreign onslaught. \r\nHence my plea to this Organization for the necessary military, economic and \r\ndiplomatic support to repel the invaders. \r\nThe war has continued to attract attention at international gatherings. \r\nAt the recent summit of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) \r\nheld at Dakar, for example, a far-reaching communique was adopted by the Heads \r\nof State which, among other things, gave Charles Taylor and his fellow rebels \r\none month to fully comply with the Yamoussoukro Agreement, which includes, as \r\nan important element, the creation of a buffer zone between Liberia and Sierra \r\nLeone. Failing such compliance, all countries of the subregion would be \r\nrequired to impose sanctions against him and his armed bandits. We call upon \r\nthe international community to lend full support to the efforts of ECOWAS and \r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) to bring these senseless and reckless \r\nacts of banditry to a speedy conclusion. \r\nOn the question of the rehabilitation of areas devastated by the war, my \r\nGovernment has adopted definitive measures that will be put into place as soon \r\nas peace returns to those areas. In this connection, a National \r\nRehabilitation Committee has been set up to oversee this particular matter. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nIt is for us a source of comfort that the international community stands ready \r\nto support us with a rehabilitation exercise as soon as the right atmosphere \r\nprevails. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n31 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nIn so far as the second objective, regarding the revitalization of our \r\nsick and battered economy, is concerned, my Government has continued to be \r\nguided by the understanding reached with the World Bank and the International \r\nMonetary Fund. My Government has demonstrated its determination to keep the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund programme on course. The new 1992-1993 budget, \r\nwhich was recently adopted, was framed with this particular aim in view. The \r\nsigns are that we shall succeed. A dynamic programme for the collection of \r\nGovernment taxes and dues has been launched by the Department of Finance, and \r\nweekly as well as monthly revenue returns show that effective work is now \r\ngoing on to harness all financial resources due the Government. The \r\nDepartment of Trade and the Armed Forces have taken effective steps to ensure \r\nthat our basic commodities are not taken out of the country illegally, a \r\npractice which was rampant in the past. \r\nNaturally the undertakings subscribed to by our Government have not been \r\neasy to implement in view of the weak nature of the economy and the suffering \r\nit imposes on our people. Nevertheless, the National Provisional Ruling \r\nCouncil Government is determined to see the programme through because of its \r\nawareness that only by succeeding in this difficult endeavour can we hope to \r\nachieve meaningful economic salvation and progress in the near future. \r\nOn the objective relating to the relaunching of the democratic process in \r\nSierra Leone, the National Provisional Ruling Council firmly believes that a \r\ndemocratic system of government can operate only within certain parameters \r\nwhich, if absent, will abort that process sooner or later. When the National \r\nProvisional Ruling Council assumed the reins of government it also inherited \r\nan unresponsive bureaucracy which had aided and abetted the political system \r\nthat had ruined the socio-economic fabric of our society. The National \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n32 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nProvisional Ruling Council Government therefore found it necessary as a first \r\nstep to embark on a cleaning-up exercise to provide the basis for building a \r\nsustainable democratic system. For reasons of national security, some people \r\nhave had to be taken into protective custody while they are, naturally, being \r\ninvestigated. All such persons are being well treated and investigated in \r\naccordance with internationally accepted standards. They have been allowed \r\naccess to their lawyers. The International Committee of the Red Cross and \r\nAmnesty International have been allowed to make regular visits. Recently, 18 \r\nLiberian nationals who had been detained for alleged rebel activities were \r\nreleased. \r\nThe various commissions of inquiry set up to investigate the detainees, \r\namong others, have remained impartial. Those found innocent will immediately \r\nbe released while those with cases to answer will face an open and impartial \r\ntrial. \r\nI wish to reiterate here that the National Provisional Ruling Council \r\nGovernment is committed to the rule of law and to the fundamental human rights \r\nand freedoms of the individual. \r\nAs an indication of our commitment to the democratic process, the \r\nNational Provisional Ruling Council has established an advisory council made \r\nup of eminent citizens from various walks of life and of proven integrity to \r\nadvise the Government on the restoration of the democratic process. The \r\nprincipal task of that council will be to work out the modalities for \r\nreturning the country to genuine multiparty democracy in the light of our \r\nnational experience and within the shortest time possible. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n33 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nSince assuming office four months ago the National Provisional Ruling \r\nCouncil has brought about a completely new framework and spirit within which \r\naffairs of State and Government are conducted. In the first place, a new \r\ndrive has been launched to generate total commitment, dedication and \r\nefficiency on the part of all Government and State functionaries. Sierra \r\nLeoneans generally are being made aware that they should see themselves as \r\nfirst-class citizens in their own country and that the potential of their \r\ncountry, in terms of economic and natural resources, can be harnessed to the \r\nfull only by hard work, honesty and dedication on their part. We have \r\nattempted to liberate Sierra Leoneans from shame, restore their vision of what \r\nour country should be and enable every citizen to enjoy the fruits of his or \r\nher labour. \r\nIn spite of our youth we believe we have demonstrated that capacity for \r\nleadership, that concern for our nation\u0027s welfare that previous Governments \r\nhad failed to provide our country in the past 24 years. The youthfulness of \r\nthe National Provisional Ruling Council Government should therefore not be \r\nheld against us or made a reason for not extending economic assistance to our \r\ncountry. After a long period of darkness and neglect, the men, women and \r\nchildren of Sierra Leone deserve the support of the international community. \r\nWe in Sierra Leone continue to view with dismay the unfavourable \r\ninternational economic environment. The continuing denial of access to a \r\ngreater market share for our exports, the gradual decline in export earnings \r\nand the continuing inability to meet the target for official development \r\nassistance, not to mention the shortfall in real terms of such assistance, \r\ncoupled with the high percentage of our gross domestic product diverted to \r\ndebt-servicing. Each year it has been reported that the countries of \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nsub-Saharan Africa struggle to pay about one third of the interest due on \r\ntheir debt of $150 billion; the rest is added to the rising mountain of debt \r\nunder which the hope of the continent lies buried. The fact of the matter is \r\nthat even the small portion of the interest which developing countries such as \r\nmine manage to pay is absorbing one quarter of all our export earnings and \r\ncosting us each year more than our total expenditure on the health and \r\neducation of our peoples. It is in the light of this that the conclusion has \r\nbeen drawn that all our efforts at socio-economic development will come to \r\nnaught unless and until effective measures are taken to address the African \r\ndebt problem, which is now an unbearable burden. \r\nWhile Sierra Leone continues to welcome the various initiatives that have \r\nbeen proposed, including those first put forward by Prime Minister Major of \r\nthe United Kingdom and since developed into the Trinidad terms, and to pay \r\ntribute to those creditor countries that considered it necessary to cancel \r\nsome of our debts, it is the widely held view, after careful study, that the \r\npresent initiatives cannot be even remotely effective in achieving the \r\nobjective of relieving debt burdens sufficiently for African countries to have \r\na reasonable chance of successfully achieving structural adjustment, recovery \r\nor growth in the foreseeable future. It therefore remains our firm conviction \r\nthat our plea for debt relief is both compelling and humane and hence must be \r\nanswered. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n36 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nFor many developing countries especially the least developed, like \r\nSierra Leone - negative growth has become an all-too-familiar feature of \r\neconomic performance, with three-digit inflation among its worst features. \r\nSimply put, this is not a situation that can be sustained indefinitely. \r\nInvariably, the greater the stresses many of our countries are called upon to \r\nbear, the less likely it becomes for the world economy to assume its own \r\nsteady growth. While the interdependence of the global economy cannot be \r\nover-emphasized, the fact remains that in a global recession the pain is all \r\nthe greater for countries such as mine. \r\nIt is primarily for this reason that we hope that the New Agenda for the \r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, adopted by the Assembly last year, will \r\nattract a much greater degree of response and support than did its \r\npredecessor, the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic \r\nRecovery and Development 1986-1990. The innovative and more positive approach \r\nthat the New Agenda offers should be seized by the international community to \r\narrest and reverse the downward trend that the severity of the many economic \r\nand human crises has inflicted on African development. We cannot afford one \r\nmore failure in this enterprise. \r\nSerious as our domestic preoccupations are, we shall be remiss if we fail \r\nto see events taking place elsewhere as important. It is in this vein that we \r\nmust once again register our deep concern over the bloody violence that in \r\nrecent months has been visited on the people of South Africa. The massacres \r\nin Boipatong and, even more recently, in Ciskei have today become a metaphor \r\nfor the struggle against apartheid - just as Soweto was decades ago. How many \r\nmore lives have to be lost, how many more families must taste the bitter fruit \r\nof violence, before the South African Government realizes that the campaign of \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n37 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nterror being waged by its agents merely increases the scepticism over its real \r\nintentions? \r\nIf the South African Government is to continue to receive the cautious \r\napproval of the international community for its agenda of political reform of \r\nits society, it must demonstrate good faith by arresting the descent into \r\nanarchy and bringing the perpetrators of the violence to justice. Denials can \r\nno longer be seen as allaying the fears of those who fervently wish to see \r\nchange come by peaceful means. \r\nSierra Leone therefore supported the decision of the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity Summit to bring the matter once again before the Security \r\nCouncil. We welcome the decision of the Council and commend the \r\nSecretary-General for dispatching observers to South Africa. This \r\ndemonstrated the international community\u0027s continued concern over South \r\nAfrica, and it is our hope that the mission will help to bring a halt to the \r\nviolence and will facilitate resumption of the talks aimed at a peaceful \r\nsolution of the problem. \r\nSouthern Africa continues to be plagued by conflict, and the human cost \r\nis a grim reminder of how much more needs to be done to bring hope to the \r\nlives of the peoples of the subregion, especially those of Mozambique. Too \r\nmany years of conflict have done little but ravage the country and leave the \r\npeople with not much to hope for. Lately, with the proposed ceasefire \r\nagreement, there have been some hopeful signs. We commend the role playod by \r\nvarious statesmen .in bringing this about, and we believe that the United \r\nNations should bring its experience to bear in this final phase of the \r\nconflict. Now that a solution to the conflict is in sight, it is our hope \r\nthat the world community will increase its humanitarian assistance to \r\nMozambigue, in view of the famine that threatens the population. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n38 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nWith preparations under way in Angola for elections leading to a national \r\ngovernment, it is our hope that peace will once again reign in that war-torn \r\nbrotherly country. \r\nSomalia today has the makings of a great tragedy. With the raging of \r\nwar, and the consequent massive outflow of refugees from that country, it is \r\nessential that the international community respond much more urgently and \r\nvigorously to this catastrophe. We cannot afford to sit by and watch the \r\npeople of Somalia descend into a quagmire of death and destruction. From this \r\ntribune Sierra Leone calls on the Somali leaders to stop the war a war that \r\nhas caused so much suffering to their people end the national suicide and \r\nembark on a process of negotiation and reconciliation. We should like to \r\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General for bringing this tragedy to \r\nthe attention of the international community. \r\nThe plight of the southern Sudanese people, though perhaps less visible \r\nand less reported, is no less tragic than that of the people of Somalia. As a \r\nresult of a long-running civil war, millions of Sudanese are today languishing \r\nand facing a slow and painful death through neglect and famine and because of \r\nmilitary siege. Given the perils and immense suffering facing them, we call \r\non this Organization to intensify its humanitarian-assistance efforts and its \r\nefforts to find a durable solution to the civil war now going on in that \r\nbrotherly country. The peoples of Somalia and Sudan require all the support \r\nof this Organization, and, indeed, of the international community as a whole, \r\nin this their hour of national tragedy. \r\nThe current Middle East negotiations have renewed our confidence that \r\nthere will be peace in that volatile region. We allow ourselves to hope that \r\nin the peace talks now taking place all the parties - Israelis, Palestinians \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nthrough their chosen representatives, Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese will \r\nwork conscientiously and in good faith towards a resolution of decades of \r\nsuspicion and conflict. \r\nWhat the world continues to witness in the former Yugoslavia defies human \r\ncomprehension. The gravity and conseguences of that war are reminiscent of \r\nconduct that the world had wished was only a memory. As the war continues to \r\nunfold, we may once again be facing, in an insidious form, the dread effects \r\nof racism in the former Yugoslavia, euphemistically described as \"ethnic \r\ncleansing\". This time should be different. We are concerned over the \r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The world cannot afford to be silent \r\nover what may become yet another sad chapter in its history. The ongoing \r\nefforts to bring that conflict to a speedy conclusion and save innocent lives \r\nmust be intensified. We call upon all the peoples of the former Yugoslavia \r\npeoples we so much respected and admired to hearken to our plea, to bury the \r\nhatchet and try to live in peace once more. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n41 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nIn other areas of the world, the guns of war have fallen silent and \r\npeace is being given a chance. In Cambodia and Angola there is renewed \r\nexpectation and hope that peace will endure. To all these peoples, we in \r\nSierra Leone extend our best wishes and urge them not to be distracted from \r\nthe path of peaceful solution upon which they have embarked. \r\nWhen I started my address to the Assembly, I referred to this year as \r\nbeing a momentous one. Few years have been as auspicious as this one. The \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at \r\nRio de Janeiro this year provided us with a renewed opportunity to demonstrate \r\nour respect for the environment and ensure that our efforts at socio-economic \r\ndevelopment and the elimination of poverty should not be at the expense of the \r\nenvironment. Hence, Sierra Leone welcomes and supports the call for \r\nsustainable development of the environment. \r\nAlso in the course of this momentous year we have observed a renewal of \r\nfaith in the United Nations as mankind\u0027s best hope for peace, security and \r\nprogress. Nowhere was this more visible than at the summit meeting of the \r\nSecurity Council held on 31 January. We saw life breathed into a dormant \r\nconcept, a blueprint take shape, and the first steps of a long-delayed journey \r\ncharted. For over four decades the Organization has wrestled with itself, \r\ntorn between competing ideologies, becoming a helpless spectator to conflicts \r\nacross the globe, paralysed with the cold-war neurosis. Our collective \r\nactions during this period seldom bore resemblance to the vision of the \r\nCharter, embracing, as they often did, more an inclination towards the veto \r\nthan inspirations by altruistic considerations. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n42 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nLooking back, many will say we came through a crippling ritual sorely \r\ntesting the Organization\u0027s capacity for promoting conflict resolution, social \r\nprogress and better standards of living, while undermining our own faith in \r\nthe efficacy of multilateralism. History may yet treat us kindly if we seize \r\nthis sense of moment, seeing it as one more opportunity for all of us to give \r\nbirth to the dream of the Charter. \r\nAs the Secretary-General observes in his report, \"An Agenda for Peace\": \r\n\"The manifest desire of the membership to work together is a new \r\nsource of strength in our common endeavour.\" (A/47/277, para. 6) \r\nIndeed, the road ahead may be a demanding one, replete with pitfalls, \r\nchallenging the emerging metamorphosis while enticing us to return to the \r\nmentality of the past. We must therefore be driven by a focused determination \r\nto broaden our horizon of cooperation, acting in a manner consistent with the \r\nCharter, thus ensuring that the peoples of the world inherit the common ends \r\nenvisaged by the Charter. \r\nIn closing, I should like, on behalf of my delegation and on my own \r\naccount, to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General who, since his election, \r\nhas left no stone unturned in exerting himself to find peaceful solutions to \r\nthe many problems facing our world today. We recall our first encounter with \r\nthe Secretary-General earlier this year in Dakar during the summit meeting of \r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) when we came to appreciate his wise \r\ncounsel, which we took to heart. He has been reported to be a man who was \r\nborn to be Secretary-General. By his leadership and other qualities he has \r\njustified the confidence which we in Africa first reposed in him and which the \r\nrest of the international community later endorsed. We wish him continued \r\nsuccess in his mission. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n43 \r\n(Chairman Strasser) \r\nFinally, I should like once again to appeal through you, Mr. President, \r\nto the international community for their understanding. Our intervention of \r\n29 April was prompted by the highest of motives the salvation of our \r\nnation. Like most of the representatives in the Assembly, we are committed to \r\nthe democratic process and to the fundamental human rights of our fellow \r\ncitizens. We also happen to believe in good governance, that political power \r\nmust be exercised responsibly and in the interest of those for whom it is held \r\nin trust. This is our credo. We therefore appeal to the international \r\ncommunity to give us a chance, to enable us to plot a new course for our \r\nnation and its people, to lay a solid foundation for a genuine democratic \r\nprocess and to put in place a realistic programme of economic recovery and \r\nsurvival. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Chairman of the National Provisional Ruling Council of the Republic of \r\nSierra Leone for the statement he has just made. \r\nCaptain Valentine E. M. Strasser. Chairman of the National Provisional \r\nRuling Council of the Republic of Sierra Leone, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.* \r\n* Mr. Aksin (Turkey), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n44-45 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nMr. SOLANA MORALES (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): The \r\nGovernment of Mexico congratulates Mr. Stoyan Ganev on his election as \r\nPresident to guide the work of the General Assembly. It also congratulates \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali on his decision to engage in active diplomacy, to \r\ninitiate the changes called for in the Secretariat and to devise new ways of \r\nstrengthening the Organization. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Solana Morales. Mexico) \r\nMexico extends a most cordial welcome to the 13 new Member States. \r\nThe new conditions in the world, the long-standing aspirations of peoples \r\nand the pressures of all kinds facing this forty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly reguire us to chart a clear course. The disappearance of the \r\nblocs has not led to the emergence of the peaceful world of which we dreamed. \r\nUncertainty prevails. In many societies, one political order has disappeared \r\nand the order which has taken its place is in the midst of a difficult process \r\nof shaping itself. World trends are extremely contradictory. Some countries\u0027 \r\nefforts to integrate are in contrast to the disintegration of other \r\ncountries. It would appear that the potential for conflict, now free of \r\nideological bonds, has increased in various regions of the world. \r\nDespite the fact that bipolarity has vanished, international peace and \r\nsecurity continue to be threatened by aggressive nationalisms, political and \r\nreligious fanaticism and, above all, the conditions of critical poverty and \r\ninequality of opportunities that separate some peoples from others. As this \r\nsession of the General Assembly takes place, thousands of people are \r\ncontinuing to die in the fratricidal wars in former Yugoslavia and other parts \r\nof the world. In Africa, the life of whole populations is threatened by \r\nhunger. The life of more than half of the world\u0027s population is dominated by \r\nunemployment and the impossibility of attaining decent levels of health, \r\neducation, food and housing. \r\nDecisive progress in economic, social and human development and \r\nroot-and-branch rectification of the structural imbalances in international \r\nsociety are necessary conditions for genuine and lasting peace. One fifth of \r\nthe world\u0027s population, 1 billion people inhabiting the most industrialized \r\ncountries, consume 70 per cent of the planet\u0027s resources. In income terms. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Solana Morales. Mexiro) \r\nthe polarization of inequalities is even greater. The richest fifth of the \r\nworld\u0027s population accounts for 83 per cent of total income, while the poorest \r\nfifth has to make do with 1.4 per cent. Future prospects are no less tragic: \r\nthe World Bank estimates that the income of the population with the fewest \r\nresources will fall from $370 a year to only $225 by the year 2000. \r\nNow that the cold war is over, there is no argument strong enough to \r\njustify the persistence of these imbalances. Plenty and overabundance for a \r\nfew cannot coexist with poverty and deprivation for the majorities. We can \r\nalready see the global impact of these inequalities: The increase in \r\nmigrations to the more prosperous countries is unprecedented. Millions of \r\npeople throughout the world are forming legions of refugees and displaced \r\npersons. It would be a dangerous illusion for the rich societies to believe \r\nthat their security is not in jeopardy from the intensification of these \r\nimbalances. \r\nIt must be recognized that it will not be possible to cure \r\nunderdevelopment and the resulting poverty and marginalization in many \r\ncountries by the use of market forces alone. What is needed is a major \r\ninternal correction effort involving both the State and private individuals, \r\nor involving mainly the State, when private individuals are unwilling, do not \r\nknow how or do not have the resources to act. A favourable international \r\nenvironment is also required to more effectively encourage a comprehensive \r\nsolution to the serious problems of underdevelopment. \r\nThe Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is promoting the \r\nexpansion of markets and the need for flows of goods and services to grow \r\nwithout artificial barriers of a political or economic nature. We therefore \r\nalready have a free trade agreement with Chile, and we have just negotiated a \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Solana Morales. Mexico) \r\ntreaty to establish the North American free trade area, which will be the most \r\npotent trading zone in the world. With an open trading system, without \r\ndiscrimination and protectionist barriers, the developing countries could earn \r\naround $44 billion more from exports. That would undoubtedly increase the \r\nviability of the structural reforms these nations have undertaken, and would \r\nreflect international solidarity with these countries. \r\nMexico has been active in promoting reform of the United Nations. It has \r\njoined the consensus that there is a vital need to redistribute functions and \r\nresponsibilities among its organs, increase coordination and democratize its \r\nprocedures. Our Organization is overworked and underfinanced. Its renewal \r\nmust include the fulfilment by all Members of their financial commitments. \r\nThat there is an endemic financial crisis at the United Nations, in the face \r\nof the extensive tasks the community is seeking to assign to it, is an \r\nincongruency which must be resolved without delay. \r\nMexico recognizes the relevance of the Secretary-General\u0027s report \r\nentitled \"An Agenda for Peace\", submitted for the consideration of Member \r\nStates. It is a rigorous document, and proposes the innovative measures that \r\nare needed in order to enable our Organization to respond to the challenges of \r\na new era. The ideas that it puts before us for achieving a better balance \r\nbetween the principal organs of the United Nations appear to us to be on the \r\nright lines. \r\nWe need to give the General Assembly the primacy it should enjoy as the \r\nOrganization\u0027s universal and pluralistic organ par excellence. We have to \r\nachieve better coordination between it and the Security Council, above all in \r\nmatters of international peace and security. We agree with the strengthening \r\nof the Secretary-General\u0027s capacity for action. We consider that the \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Solana Morales. Mexico) \r\nSecretary-General should be authorized to seek advisory opinions from the \r\nInternational Court of Justice on condition, of course, that the States \r\nconcerned have reguested his involvement. \r\nMexico has also indicated the need for a better balance in the treatment \r\nof the items on the international agenda. We pay too much attention to the \r\nso-called new global issues at the expense of development problems, combating \r\nextreme poverty and strengthening international cooperation. The best \r\npreventive diplomacy is one in which programmes in support of development are \r\nan essential element. These are the best guarantees of stable and lasting \r\npeace. \r\nThe economic and social sector of the Organization needs to be \r\nrevitalized. Now is the time to increase the efficiency of the organs on \r\nwhich rests the main responsibility for economic and social activities: the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Second and Third Committees of the \r\nAssembly. \r\nMy country has reiterated that the internal transformation of the United \r\nNations organs, as well as of relationships between them, needs to be \r\nsupplemented by the democratization of decision-making. This will entail \r\nreviewing, in due course, the anachronistic veto system. We must dispel the \r\nrisk of the Security Council\u0027s becoming merely an instrument for lending the \r\nappearance of joint action to the designs of a few powerful countries. The \r\ndeliberative and decision-making processes must be transparent. The tendency \r\nfor the taking of decisions by consensus to become more widespread must not \r\npose an obstacle to participation by Council members, nor must it impede \r\nin-depth debate among them. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Solana Morales. Mexico) \r\nSome of the measures proposed in the Secretary-General\u0027s report need to \r\nbe studied thoroughly and carefully, as they might prove to be \r\ncounterproductive. Deployment of troops along the borders of a State that \r\nfeels threatened might aggravate the problem it was designed to forestall. \r\nThe proposal for the conduct of preventive deployment operations in \r\nconditions of national crisis gives grounds for concern. A measure of this \r\nkind could involve the Organization in issues that are strictly within the \r\ninternal jurisdiction of States. \r\nSimilarly, what is known as \"support for the transformation of deficient \r\nnational structures and capabilities, and for the strengthening of new \r\ndemocratic institutions\" (A/47/277, para. 59). should be examined with great \r\ncare, since these matters fall within the exclusive sovereignty of States. \r\nThe report also echoes positions that Mexico has supported. We agree \r\nthat States should accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of \r\nJustice. Honduras and El Salvador have set the world an example of their \r\ndesire for harmony and peace by submitting their territorial dispute to the \r\nInternational Court for resolution. \r\nMexico welcomes the insistence of the Secretary-General that diplomatic \r\naction should be exhausted before use is made of the coercive measures for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security referred to in Chapter VII of \r\nthe Charter. \r\nDespite the disquieting signs in the international environment, obvious \r\nadvances have been made which enable us to look with hope to the potential of \r\nthe United Nations to work towards a more stable and a more secure world. \r\nLong-drawn-out conflicts that had been deadlocked for years are today on the \r\nway to resolution. The peace process in El Salvador is perhaps the most \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Solana Morales. Mexico) \r\nsuccessful of those in which the Organization has participated. It is up to \r\nthe parties and the Organization itself to do everything in their power to \r\nensure the implementation, within the time-frame scheduled, of the commitments \r\nentered into. Mexico appeals to the international community to provide, as \r\nsoon as possible, the economic assistance promised for the cause of peace in \r\nEl Salvador. \r\nIn the realm of disarmament, definite progress has been achieved in the \r\nquantitative reduction of nuclear arsenals but we are far from having \r\neliminated the danger of a nuclear catastrophe. There has been an increase in \r\nthe number of States that possess nuclear weapons, and the doctrine of nuclear \r\ndeterrence continues to serve as grounds for justifying the existence and \r\nimprovement of such weapons. \r\nIn the face of these dangers, we must put an end to nuclear testing. We \r\ntherefore express our gratitude to those countries that have decided to \r\ninstitute moratoriums. Mexico will continue to work to see to it that at this \r\nsession we are able to make progress together towards the total elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons from the planet. \r\nTherefore, the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons deserves our full attention. We are \r\ngratified at the progress in respect of the Treaty of Tlatelolco. We welcome \r\nthe ratification by France of Additional Protocol I and the process leading to \r\nthe full incorporation of Argentina, Brazil and Chile in the \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Latin America. We hope that Cuba will also soon \r\nbe incorporated into this regime, as well as Guyana and St. Kitts and Nevis. \r\nMention also needs to be made of the Convention on chemical weapons, the \r\noutcome of 10 years\u0027 work by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Conference on \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Solana Morales. Mexico) \r\nDisarmament. Although the Convention is undoubtedly subject to improvement, \r\nMexico hopes that it will lead to the elimination of one of the most \r\nreprehensible means of mass destruction. \r\nThe Rio de Janeiro Conference, held last June, was a basic step towards \r\ngreater awareness at the world level of the relationship between the problems \r\nof the environment and those of development. The General Assembly has the \r\nresponsibility of creating institutional machinery to follow up, promote and \r\nperfect the implementation of \"Agenda 21\", approved at Rio. The establishment \r\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development is a central item on our agenda. \r\nIn this regard, I should like to make three points: the first is that \r\nthis Commission should not confine itself to reviewing the progress made in \r\nRio, but should become a high-level forum for updating and introducing new \r\nproposals designed to promote development and the protection of the \r\nenvironment. \r\nThe second point relates to its mandate of supervising and broadening the \r\ncommitment with regard to financing. We shall achieve little in the struggle \r\nfor sustainable development of the planet if the countries that possess the \r\nmost and have contributed the most to pollution do not increase the resources \r\nallocated to halting the destruction of the environment. The Commission to be \r\nappointed by this General Assembly must ensure that it is the polluter who \r\npays. \r\nFinally, following up on the Rio agreements calls for a competent \r\nsecretariat. We are expecting a small but high-level group with direct access \r\nto the Secretary-General and a clear mandate to avoid duplication of functions \r\nwith other bodies. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n54 \r\n(Mr. Solana Morales. Mexico) \r\nWe are living through a phase characterized by profound respect for human \r\nrights and democracy as the foundations of peace, freedom and human dignity. \r\nThe defence of human rights has always been at the centre of our \r\nOrganization\u0027s attention. \r\nNevertheless, we are concerned at the desire to focus greater attention \r\non some aspects of human rights to the detriment of others. Only a \r\ncomprehensive view of human rights can ensure that their protection will not \r\nbe partial or motivated by veiled aspirations towards interference. \r\nThe Organization has the opportunity of becoming the cornerstone of a new \r\nworld order worthy of that name. It is our responsibility towards future \r\ngenerations to begueath to them a forum in which peace is guaranteed and in \r\nwhich the conditions required for the development of all nations are created. \r\nInternational cooperation for development cannot be approached from one \r\nstandpoint alone. We must not view it solely as a complement to actions to \r\nresolve conflicts or to reduce it to technical assistance programmes, nor can \r\nit be confined to general recommendations regarding the liberalization of \r\ntrade and internal and international competitiveness. \r\nThe priorities are clear: putting an end to extreme poverty and creating \r\nthe conditions in which all human beings will find real opportunities for \r\ndevelopment. To this end, a tremendous and serious effort to coordinate \r\neconomic policies and the explicit will to make international law the \r\ncompulsory reference point governing relations among peoples are essential. \r\nInternational- law is the binding force that will make it possible to \r\nbuild a true international order at the end of this century. Our Organization \r\nmust assume with clear vision, dedication and courage world leadership in the \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n55 \r\n(Mr. Solana Morales. Mexico) \r\ndefence of international law. Respect for the internal jurisdiction of States \r\nis the basis for our civilized and peaceful coexistence. \r\nMexico categorically rejects the claim of any State to have the right to \r\napply its laws beyond its own frontiers. Nor can acts that violate the \r\njuridical order of another country on the pretext of ensuring respect for \r\none\u0027s law be legal. All States must conform in their actions to the rules \r\nthat have been accepted by the sovereign will of nations and agreements. This \r\nis the only lasting foundation on which to base changes in a world order that \r\nis in a state of transition. \r\nHere in this universal forum, Mexico emphasizes its unswerving commitment \r\nto the need to strengthen international law. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n56 \r\nADDRESS BY MR. HANS BRUNHART, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT AND MINISTER FOR FOREIGN \r\nAFFAIRS OF THE PRINCIPALITY OF LIECHTENSTEIN \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Principality of \r\nLiechtenstein. \r\nMr. Hans Brunhart. Head of Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Principality of Liechtenstein, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming the Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Principality of \r\nLiechtenstein, Mr. Hans Brunhart, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nMr. BRUNHART (Liechtenstein): Permit me to extend to you, Mr. \r\nPresident, our heartfelt congratulations on your election, which demonstrates \r\nMember States\u0027 conviction that you have the ability to conduct the work of \r\nthis session of the General Assembly with diplomatic skill and efficiency. I \r\nassure you of the support of the delegation of Liechtenstein. \r\nI should like to also express to your predecessor. \r\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, our recognition of his outstanding conduct of the \r\nbusiness of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. \r\nFurthermore, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to you, Mr. \r\nSecretary-General, for your efforts better to eguip the United Nations to meet \r\nthe new challenges it faces as a result of the far-reaching changes taking \r\nplace in the world. We hope that the Organization, under your leadership and \r\nin close cooperation and agreement with Member States and other United Nations \r\norgans and bodies, will be able to continue to perform its important duties \r\neffectively. It is my hope that close cooperation will develop between you \r\nand my country. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Brunhart. Liechtenstein) \r\nTwo years ago Liechtenstein was accepted as the one hundred and \r\nfifty-ninth member of the United Nations. This occasion was for my country \r\nthe culmination of its efforts to become an equal partner in the international \r\ncommunity of States and to share responsibility for overcoming the global and \r\nregional problems we face today. \r\nThe two years of our membership have been marked by far-reaching \r\npolitical changes. As one of the conseguences of these changes, 20 new \r\nMembers have been admitted to the United Nations since 1990. Accordingly, \r\nLiechtenstein would like particularly to welcome those countries that have \r\nbecome Members of the United Nations this year: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Croatia, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. \r\nSince its entry Liechtenstein has sought to be an active member of the \r\nUnited Nations, although as a small country our possibilities are very \r\nlimited. We are thankful for the understanding Member States have shown for \r\nour special situation. \r\nAll States, whether small or large, whether powerful or powerless, need \r\nthe United Nations. Small States, however, have special grounds for belonging \r\nto the world Organization. One of these is the fact that the United Nations \r\nis based on a requirement of universal respect for the law of nations; \r\nsovereignty, especially that of a small State, can be secured, ensured and \r\nguaranteed only when all States, especially the large and powerful, respect \r\ninternational law. We have confidence in the United Nations, but at the same \r\ntime we are aware that the Organization cannot resolve all conflicts. It can, \r\nhowever, establish standards of conduct for the civilized behaviour of nations \r\ntowards one another. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Brunhart. Liechtenstein) \r\nFor a short time after the end of the cold war we believed that we were \r\ngoing through a phase of almost exclusively positive changes and upheavals. \r\nDemocratic Governments were replacing authoritarian regimes, and millions of \r\npeople were attaining the freedom they had long been denied. But that time \r\nwas short-lived. Today the international community of States finds itself \r\nfacing no fewer problems than before. Instead of a diminution, there has been \r\na deepening of the North-South conflict; regional conflicts driven by ethnic, \r\nreligious, social and cultural differences are coming to a head; and \r\nenvironmental damage is threatening us and future generations. \r\nSimultaneously, however, expectations have risen and prospects improved \r\nof the United Nations being able to play more fully the role that was \r\nenvisaged for it when it was established. Liberation from the burden of the \r\nbig-Power confrontation has indeed made our peoples and nations clearly aware \r\nof the world\u0027s mutual interdependence, but we are still not of one mind \r\nregarding the order in which to list the problems to which the United Nations \r\nshould devote its priority attention. Quite obviously, the structures of an \r\norganization founded 47 years ago need to be adapted to the realities and new \r\ndemands of these greatly changed times. \r\nWe therefore welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s report, \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\" (A/47/277), and see it as providing a useful basis for the efforts to \r\nimprove the capacity of the United Nations to establish and maintain peace in \r\nthe world. We believe that the proposals regarding preventive diplomacy in \r\nparticular, contained in section III of the report, need to be looked at very \r\nclosely with a view to creating means of preventing disputes or limiting their \r\nescalation. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Mr. Brunhart. Liechtenstein) \r\nInternal conflicts have become a special challenge to the community of \r\nStates. Ethnic, social or religious disagreements often give rise to regional \r\ninstability. We are aware of the fact that a number of the new States Members \r\nof the United Nations, in particular, are in an extremely difficult economic \r\nand political situation. \r\nLiechtenstein would like in this connection to express particularly its \r\nsympathy with the victims of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The war \r\nunleashed by the aggression of Serbia and Montenegro is causing great human \r\nsuffering in that country. We are following with deep concern the continuing \r\nreports of massive and systematic violations of human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law, for which all parties to the conflict are responsible. The \r\nkilling of innocent human beings and the destruction of an irreplaceable \r\ncultural heritage must stop, and all parties must immediately make efforts to \r\nbring about a peaceful solution to their difficult problems. We support the \r\ndeclaration of principles issued on the occasion of the London Conference, \r\nheld on 26 and 27 August 1992, and the framework established by the Conference \r\nparticipants within which a comprehensive political solution to the crisis is \r\nto be sought. We express our hope that the political will demonstrated in \r\nLondon will be transformed into specific actions and that the follow-up \r\nnegotiations taking place in Geneva will soon yield positive results. \r\nIt is within that framework that I should like to refer to the initiative \r\nthat the Head of State of the Principality of Liechtenstein, \r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Hans-Adam II, introduced in his address to the \r\nforty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Brunhart. Liechtenstein) \r\nOn that occasion His Serene Highness referred to the need to find ways \r\nof promoting peaceful solutions to the many conflicts which have their roots \r\nin the tensions which exist between communities within States. His Serene \r\nHighness considered that such solutions should be sought within the framework \r\nof the principle of self-determination. \r\nLiechtenstein is aware of the consideration already given within the \r\nUnited Nations and indeed within other bodies - to the principle of self-\r\ndetermination. We acknowledge the great international effort devoted to this \r\nquestion in the past. \r\nThe right to self-determination as a principle is now universally \r\naccepted. I would recall not only that self-determination is one of the \r\nfoundations of the Charter but also that most States represented in the \r\nAssembly are already under certain specific legal obligations in this area by \r\nvirture of Article 1 of each of the great human rights Covenants of 1966. \r\nThere it is formally and with legally binding effect acknowledged that: \r\n\"All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of \r\nthat right they freely determine their political status and freely \r\npursue their economic, social and cultural development.\" \r\nDespite all this, and with some notable exceptions, the practical and \r\npeaceful application of that principle has often been lacking. Tensions \r\nbetween distinctive communities within States, or between such communities and \r\nthe State itself, persist in many parts of the world. Regrettably, they have \r\nin a number of ins.tances led to outbreaks of serious violence. Apart from the \r\nhuman suffering which ressults, such tensions and violence often affect \r\nneighbouring States, and may have a more widespread impact on the maintenance \r\nof international peace generally. Much can be done to try to limit the \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Brunhart. Liechtenstein) \r\nsuffering once the violence has started; but how much better it would be to go \r\nto the root of the problem which is often to be found in the frustrations of \r\ndistinctive comunities when they are denied the legitimate expression of their \r\ncommunal identities and aspirations. \r\nI am glad to say that His Serene Highness\u0027s statement last year \r\nattracted the interest of a number of delegations. During the past year we \r\nhave undertaken extensive consultations, and we have benefitted greatly from \r\nconstructive suggestions which delegations have been kind enough to make. We \r\nare most grateful to all those Governments for the interest they have shown. \r\nWe have also sought, and taken into account, some independent expert views. \r\nIt is against this background that Liechtenstein believes that the \r\ninternational community, through this Assembly, should take steps to make the \r\nright of self-determination more effective, and by doing so contribute to the \r\navoidance of some future conflicts. It is our conviction that the time has \r\nnow come for the international community, through the United Nations, to offer \r\na realistic way forward, by establishing a practical framework through which \r\ncommunities can give expression to their distinctive gualities. \r\nSuch a practical framework would need to satisfy four main reguirements: \r\nFirst, there should be flexible and graduated forms of \r\nself-determination involving different levels of autonomy, taking account of \r\nthe differing needs of differing communities and the States of which they form \r\npart; a subdivided community which allows its various parts to pursue the \r\ncommon goal in their own way can on occasion be a very good expression of the \r\nprinciple of self-determination; \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Brunhart. Liechtenstein) \r\nSecondly, communities invoking the principle of self-determination \r\nshould renounce resort to violence and commit themselves to pursuing their \r\naims through peaceful means only; \r\nThirdly, assistance in the effective realization of the principle of \r\nself-determination should be available through independent procedures; and \r\nFourthly, a proper balance must be maintained between self-determination \r\nand the territorial integrity of States. \r\nSubject always to those requirements being met, we believe that the \r\ninternational community should recognize that self-determination is an \r\ninherent attribute of all communities which possess a distinctive social and \r\nterritorial identity. This involves the free choice by each community of its \r\npolitical, social, economic and cultural destiny in accordance with the best \r\ninterests of its members. \r\nSelf-determination, it must be stressed, is not necessarily or even \r\nprimarily a matter of moving towards independent statehood. Indiscriminate \r\nindependence would lead to the fragmentation of the international community \r\nand would insufficiently respect the territorial integrity of States. In \r\nreality, however, full independence is, if only for purely practical reasons, \r\nthe least likely outcome in most cases. \r\nRespect for diversity can be adeguately reflected in other ways. \r\nSelf-determination can take various forms, as may be best suited to each \r\ncommunity\u0027s and each State\u0027s particular circumstances. \r\nIt is important to retain the essential flexibility of the concept. But \r\nin all cases where there exists a community with a sufficient degree of \r\ndistinctive identity, it seems right that a certain basic level of autonomy \r\nshould be acknowledged. I am referring to such very elementary matters as \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n64 \r\n(Mr. Brunhart. Liechtenstein) \r\nnon-discrimination against the community or its members, their freedom to \r\npractice and enjoy their distinctive community characteristics, and their \r\nparticipation in appropriate ways in public affairs, particularly in matters \r\ndirectly affecting the community\u0027s interests. A commitment to acknowledge \r\nsuch a modest degree of autonomy for all communities that merit it should not, \r\nwe believe, cause serious problems for any Member of the United Nations. \r\nMore advanced levels of autonomy will be appropriate for communities \r\nwhose particular circumstances demonstrate their fitness to enjoy them. But \r\nwe do not think it would be realistic for the United Nations to seek to lay \r\ndown detailed mandatory requirements for the self-determination of communities \r\nwith a vast range of distinctive characteristics, settled within States whose \r\nown histories are so diverse. Anything beyond the sort of basic level of \r\nautonomy to which I have referred is probably best left to be developed on an \r\noptional basis and case by case the circumstances being so diverse that each \r\nis best left to be treated on its own merits. \r\nNevertheless, there would, in our view, be some advantage in the United \r\nNations indicating the kinds of further elements which might find a place in \r\nthe more advanced levels of autonomy. These further elements of autonomy \r\nwould progressively add to the degree to which the community conducts its own \r\naffairs but would only be available to a community with satisfactory \r\nexperience and even then, only if the State concerned is ready to accept the \r\ncommunity\u0027s more advanced level of autonomy. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n65 \r\n(Mr. Brunhart. Liechtenstein) \r\nIn this complex area we cannot assume that any general principle or \r\nrocedures which might be agreed internationally will be applied without \r\ndifficulty in particular cases. We should therefore also envisage that some \r\nprocedures be available to assist if any difficulties arise in the application \r\nof the principle of self-determination and to assist with the peaceful \r\nresolution of any differences there might be. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Brunhart. Liechtenstein) \r\nA number of delegations with which we have discussed our ideas in general \r\nterms suggested that it would be advantageous for the matter which, as well \r\nas being of great political importance, is also of considerable technical \r\ncomplexity - to be the subject of some further examination by a group of \r\nexperts so as to facilitate the progress which may eventually be made in this \r\nAssembly. \r\nWe have accordingly concluded that the most appropriate course will be \r\nfor the Government of Liechtenstein to invite each Government represented in \r\nthe Assembly and that includes those here as observers to nominate an \r\nindependent expert to attend an informal meeting of experts in Liechtenstein \r\nnext March. We hope that the experts attending that meeting will be able to \r\nassist us in further developing the ideas advanced initially by \r\nHis Serene Highness at the forty-sixth session of the Assembly. We envisage \r\nthat the experts nominated to attend will do so in their personal capacities, \r\nsince we believe that by adopting procedures which avoid committing \r\nGovernments we are more likely to have a constructive and expert discussion. \r\nInvitations to nominate experts to attend the meeting will be issued during \r\nthe course of the present session. In the light of the views expressed at the \r\nmeeting of experts, the Government of Liechtenstein will consider how best to \r\nreturn to the Assembly, perhaps at its next session in 1993, with proposals \r\nfor carrying further the initiative introduced last year by His Serene \r\nHighness. \r\nAs the international community makes progress, however haltingly, towards \r\npreventing the outbreak of violent conflicts between States, it becomes all \r\nthe more important that together we seek ways of avoiding the no less inhuman \r\nconsequences of civil wars between communities within a State. In informing \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Brunhart. Liechtenstein) \r\nthe Assembly of the lines along which our thinking on this important and \r\nsensitive matter is developing, I hope that I may have demonstrated the depth \r\nof our concern that some way should be found of controlling one major source \r\nof much violence and human suffering in today\u0027s world. \r\nMay I express my hope that the new spirit of cooperation in the United \r\nNations will help enable us to discharge the responsibility entrusted to us \r\nand to find, in consensus, solutions to the manifold problems that we face. \r\nMy delegation is ready to make its contribution in order to achieve, in \r\nefficient cooperation with other delegations, the objectives of the United \r\nNations. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Head of Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Principality of \r\nLiechtenstein for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Hans Brunhart. Head of Government of the Principality of \r\nLiechtenstein, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\nMr. BOUNKOULOU (Congo) (interpretation from French): It is with a \r\nfull awareness of the significant turning point reached by the world and the \r\nUnited Nations that the delegation of the Republic of Congo is approaching the \r\nwork of this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly over which \r\nMr. Ganev has the honour and privilege of presiding. On my own and my \r\ndelegation\u0027s behalf, I should like to congratulate him on his unanimous \r\nelection to the presidency. The General Assembly\u0027s choice reflects the high \r\nesteem and prestige which his country, Bulgaria, enjoys on the international \r\nscene. It is equally a tribute to his experience and personal qualities. \r\nI also wish once again to offer our profound gratitude to his \r\npredecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who \r\nskilfully guided the forty-sixth session. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Bounkoulou. Congo) \r\nMy delegation would like to ensure Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, of its full cooperation. \r\nLastly, I wish to extend a warm welcome to the new Members, whose \r\nadmission further strengthens the universality of the United Nations. I am \r\npleased to say that the delegation of the Republic of the Congo will be happy \r\nto work with them during the forty-seventh session and in the future. \r\nThe cold war has run its course. Upon the ruins of more than 40 years of \r\nextreme tension. States and the United Nations system are striving to organize \r\non this planet a new, more democratic and more humane order. Under the \r\nimpetus of world developments, which have galvanized the spirit of reform \r\neverywhere, the United Nations as an institution is undergoing a process of \r\nchange. It has accordingly undertaken major initiatives in the realm of \r\ncooperation for development and in the realm of peace-keeping operations and \r\nthe restoration of peace. \r\nWhat new ideas are emerging? What are their chances of success? What \r\nrisks are posed to human rights and democracy by the challenges of growing \r\npoverty, third-world debt, the AIDS pandemic, drugs, and ethnic and religious \r\nhatreds, and by ecological disasters or those that, as we approach the end of \r\nthe century, result from the world population explosion? \r\nAs has been stated, the meeting held by the Security Council on \r\n31 January 1992 was the first it had ever held at the level of Heads of State \r\nor Government. That summit symbolized the end of an era of discord that had \r\nlong paralysed the United Nations. It is understandable that the \r\ninternational Organization should henceforth seek to define itself. It wishes \r\nto strengthen its potential in various areas, while at the same time \r\nincreasing its efficacy in complying with the provisions of the Charter. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Mr. Bounkoulou. Congo) \r\nAfrica and the developing countries are active partners in reform. For \r\nis that not part of a new universalism which has become more urgent and whose \r\naim remains the satisfaction of fundamental needs? Let us concern ourselves \r\nas much with the flowering of dignity and human rights as with the economic \r\nand social well-being of all peoples. \r\nFor Africa in particular, external assistance stands as a basic \r\nprincple. But it is also to a large extent the starting point of Africa\u0027s \r\ndevelopment. That is why Africa will remain vigilant about subtle proposals \r\nthat tend to marginalize its relations with the world system. Thus, in this \r\nnew interplay of interests aimed at introducing a new culture into the United \r\nNations, Africa has everything to gain by preserving, for instance, the \r\ndecisive role the United Nations plays, under the relevant provisions of the \r\nCharter, in the realm of cooperation for economic and social development. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Bounkoulou, Congo) \r\nIn all times, the Governments that we have the honour to represent have \r\nassumed to right to lead people by assuming the duty to address forcefully the \r\nneeds of the immediate present, the hypothetical, the near future, and the \r\nlong-term. The first ambition remains to work for better societies that offer \r\nthe citizen, both as an individual and as part of the whole, less alienation \r\nand less constraint with more knowledge and more freedom. \r\nIt is noteworthy that in the constant struggle for man and society, the \r\ncommunity of nations assembled within the United Nations has accompanied \r\nnational efforts with appropriate assistance. The General Assembly, ennobled \r\nby its solemn nature, captures the resounding echo of public opinion from \r\naround the world. In this respect, it is a major source of hope. The demands \r\nwhich the Organization must now meet are unprecedented in their nature. The \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization, has written that: \r\n\"The turning-point in the scale and scope of United Nations \r\nactivities can be discerned after the year 1987. For the first time in \r\nmany years, agreement on a wide range of issues became possible, \r\neffectively marking an end to the cold war.\" (A/47/1, para. 14) \r\nThus, today more than ever, the debate in the General Assembly is rich with a \r\nvariety of issues that illustrate the expanding role of the Organization. \r\nIn actual fact, what is involved are generally new, modern challenges \r\nthat the States Members of the Organization will have to confront. This state \r\nof affairs, disturbing in itself, is mitigated by the dispelling of some \r\nproblems. Furthermore, a number of diverse national experiences, full of \r\nopportunity and hope, have developed in recent years and acquired real \r\nsignificance for freedom and restored democracy in a number of countries. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Bounkoulou. Congo) \r\nI once again welcome the fact that the United Nations is contributing \r\nactively to the democratization efforts of these nations, which are referred \r\nto in the report on the work of Organization that I have already mentioned. I \r\nshould like to address the specific case of the institutions in my country, \r\nthe Congo. \r\nIn specific terms, the Republic of the Congo is moving towards an \r\nenlarged and more participatory democracy, the blossoming of the intellectual \r\nand psychological potential of the Congolese people, and the growth of \r\nnational solidarity. Decentralization, the keystone of the new policy of \r\nProfessor Pascal Lissouba, the first democratically elected President of the \r\nRepublic, will grant administrative powers to regions in the areas of \r\nmanagement and economic development. \r\nThere are two dimensions involved in this: the rehabilitation or \r\nconstruction of administrative installations, and the promotion of initiative \r\nand innovation in the area of development and the rural environment. The aim \r\nis to improve living conditions for the poorest sectors of the population by \r\ngiving them the means to gain access to decent housing, with the emphasis on \r\nlocal building materials, water supply and sanitation, family health, the \r\neducation of infants, and income-generating activities. \r\nIn the course of this year, 1992, through the exercise of universal \r\nsufferage, the Congolese people, during successive free and fair elections \r\nperformed their duties as active citizens under the supervision of \r\ninternational observers, to whom my Government expresses its profound \r\ngratitude for the very beneficial assistance they provided our country. The \r\nhappy outcome of these elections today heralds a new era, that of democracy, \r\nto which our people is henceforth committed. Congolese public opinion, \r\nrevitalized by a reborn national press, has effectively contributed to \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Bounkoulou. Congo) \r\naverting political violence. In short, the Congo is now engaged in meaningful \r\nstructural reform, starting at the institutional level. \r\nThe Congo\u0027s new Constitution, adopted by referendum on 15 March 1992, \r\nduring the transitional period following the national conference, increases \r\nfreedoms in all areas. Almost 45 articles make up chapter II of the \r\nConstitution on rights and fundamental freedoms. Our Constitution also \r\nprovides for balanced public powers and seeks to establish strengthened \r\nsolidarity and equity. \r\nThe establishment of democracy at the local level not without its risks \r\nset the first conclusive test for the Congolese people. Local councils and \r\nmayors were elected by universal sufferage. Despite some inevitable but minor \r\nhitches, the overall system functioned in a satisfactory manner. \r\nIt is important to note the people\u0027s commitment to the new political, \r\neconomic, social, and cultural foundations upon which, after 30 years of error \r\nand disarray, the new political legitimacy of our country now rests. A \r\nbicameral parliament has been elected, with predominance given to the first \r\nchamber, the National Assembly, to which the government is accountable. Its \r\nfunctioning reflects the meticulous Congolese electoral process. \r\nThis process culminated with the presidential election held on 2 and \r\n16 August 1992. This final phase readily highlighted to public opinion, long \r\nunfamiliar with such things, the complex interplay of the many political \r\nparties and their strategic alliances. The presidential election was carried \r\nout in two ballots. It was hotly contested. The Congolese electors voted \r\nwithout constraint in secret ballot. Professor Pascal Lissouba was elected \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Congo. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n74-75 \r\n(Mr. Bounkoulou. Congo) \r\nmessage of the President of the Republic, His Excellency \r\nProfessor Pascal Lissouba. There are many reasons for hope nowadays. For our \r\ncountry, the message proclaims, there is an irresistable democratic urge that \r\nhas freed energies and galvanzied enthusiasm. Everything has once more become \r\npossible. \r\nThis historic new beginning implies a break with a development \r\nfundamentally based on such factors external to our civil society as \r\ninternational assistance, negotiated or imposed improvement in the terms of \r\ntrade, foreign investment, and the preponderant intervention of the State. \r\nThe new idea is that economic development and social progress should be based \r\nprincipally on the sense of initiative, the creativity of individuals and the \r\ncivil society, and on their capacity to act, innovate, and better manage the \r\nhuman resources and riches of the Congo. \r\nAs will have been noted, Congo\u0027s ambitions are bold. Mindful of the \r\nmagnitude of the task before us, the President of the Republic of Congo has \r\nstated: \r\n\"The concept of democracy nowadays may appear to be a gift. It is a \r\nculture, and any culture is a blending. Thus we, by virtue of our own \r\nculture, which involves a methodical and deliberate search for consensus, \r\nmust mitigate the inhumane or hard-to-accept aspects of a democracy \r\nfashioned in other climes.\" \r\nThe President went on to ask: \"What is law without custom?\" That is why he \r\ncalls for: \r\n\"respect for the assets of the community and for the love of work. This \r\nis what it will take to win the respect of our partners, even this must \r\nnecessarily rest with strengthening our links with our usual partners\"-\r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Bounkoulou. Congo) \r\nIn this vital recovery effort, the Government of national union and the \r\nCongolese people will be able to derive the greatest possible benefit from \r\ncooperation with industrialized countries, with international organizations, \r\nincluding non-governmental organizations, and from the contribution of new \r\nforms of cooperation, without frontiers, between towns, regions and \r\nenterprises in the north and in the south. \r\nMembers will not be surprised to hear me speak of certain major problems \r\nthat call for the attention of the international community and, hence, of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is quite natural that any member State might ask itself \r\n\"What can be done? Where can we start?\" It seems to us that the general \r\ndebate is an excellent opportunity to gather together the material for a \r\nresponse to these questions, on the basis of proposals and of the desire of \r\nsome to take action and others to refrain from taking action. \r\nWhat is our attitude at this moment of great political and ideological \r\nupheaval? The Congo shares the view that it is essential that the United \r\nNations continue to be an especially well-suited forum for the analysis of \r\nevents and for concept development, particularly in respect of socio-economic \r\nproblems, in a spirit of renewed partnership. Indeed, the United Nations must \r\nserve as the right institution within which to strive for global solutions. \r\nThose solutions must take into account the political, humanitarian and \r\nsocio-economic dimensions of world problems. My delegation endorses this \r\napproach, particularly with respect to assistance, trade, the transfer of \r\ntechnnologies, commodity prices and debt relief. \r\nThere is a prevailing feeling that the United Nations has a fresh \r\nopportunity to attain the objectives of the Charter - in particular, the \r\nmaintenance of peace and the restoration of peace and, it should be added \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Bounkoulou. Congo) \r\nsince the summit meeting of the Security Council, the promotion of preventive \r\ndiplomacy. Despite all the scepticism. Member States would be justified in \r\nkeeping alive the flame that was lit on 31 January in New York. In this \r\nrespect my delegation cannot but associate itself with the wise words that \r\nhave already been spoken from this rostrum. \r\nSadly, it must be acknowledged that the end of the cold war has not put \r\nan end to age-old antagonisms. After so many promising and hopeful events, we \r\nwitnessed the Yugoslav crisis break out suddenly in the heart of Europe. In \r\nAfrica, in addition to the mounting violence in South Africa violence that \r\nreflects the difficult birth pangs of a democratic, non-racial and united \r\nSouth Africa the Liberian and Somalian tragedies continue to give us reason \r\nto fear the destabilization of a number of States. As representatives must be \r\nwell aware, all these concerns have an impact on subregional security. \r\nIs it still acceptable that, in a world rich in rights and freedoms, not \r\nall peoples are really receiving the benefit thereof? Continued tribal or \r\nethnic conflicts, accompanied by war crimes, if viewed with indifference, may \r\nlead almost unnoticed to the extermination of tens of thousands of people. In \r\nEurope, people are dying in the name of ideology, and in Somalia, in the \r\nextreme eastern part of the African continent, the situation is even more \r\ntragic. Drought, combined with mindless blood-letting by clans fighting over \r\nthe shreds of power, are claiming thousands of victims. There is undoubtedly \r\na need for more international assistance. Here, once again, the activities of \r\nthe United Nations deserve praise. \r\nWe should also hail the role of the non-governmental organizations in \r\ntheir daily endeavours in the service of the human individual, as a gesture of \r\nsolidarity with mankind, regarded in its universal nature as a reasonable \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Bounkoulou. Congo) \r\nbeing. The picture is not an entirely gloomy one, if we can judge by the \r\nglimmers of hope coming from the talks that are under way in, for example, \r\nLiberia and the Middle East. \r\nIn the case of South Africa, all parties must agree to end the violence, \r\nand they must show restraint. The parties must cooperate in order to bring \r\nabout the earliest possible resumption of the negotiation process. The \r\ndevelopments of the last few weeks give us grounds to hope that this will, \r\nindeed, happen. In any event, the Republic of the Congo supports the \r\ninitiatives and all the efforts being made by the international community to \r\nfind the right solutions to these questions. It is in this spirit that, \r\ndespite its difficult economic circumstances, the Congo is contributing to \r\nvarious operations within the United Nations framework. Recently we \r\nparticipated in the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II), \r\nfollowing the positive experience of our presence in UNAVEM I. \r\nLikewise, my country supports the initiatives and decisions relating to \r\narms reduction, the halting of nuclear tests and the endeavours intended to \r\npromote transparency in international transfers of conventional arms. \r\nThe promotion of confidence-building, peace and security is still the \r\nconstant concern of many States - in particular, the States of the central \r\nAfrican subregion. In this context, in May, the Standing Advisory Committee \r\non Security Matters was created under the auspices of the United Nations. \r\nThis is one more instrument in the system of subregional cooperation. \r\nAlthough we must unite our efforts to overcome war, it is not true that \r\nthe peoples that are not experiencing the turmoils of war are necessarily \r\nliving in peace. A glance at a map of the world proves that the reverse is \r\ntrue. Africa, for example, is suffering from drought, famine and disease an \r\nappalling picture that calls for action from the community of nations. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n79-80 \r\n(Mr. Bounkoulou. Congo) \r\nIt is clear that, along with the questions of the maintenance of peace, \r\ndrug abuse, the environment and humanitarian assistance, Africa is one of the \r\nfive priorities of the United Nations in the 1990s. Paradoxically, however, \r\nsince the adoption, on 18 December 1991, of the United Nations New Agenda for \r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, the implementation of that programme, \r\nbased on a new partnership, is suffering from a lack of priority. This \r\nsituation requires attention. \r\nThe problems of drug abuse present another painful and devastating \r\npicture for the peoples of the continents of Europe, America and Asia. How \r\ncan we successfully tackle all these challenges and others the acquired \r\nimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic, for example without cooperation \r\nand solidarity between States? \r\nThere is one undeniable fact: the aspiration to democracy is now \r\nuniversal. This heightened awareness should be regarded as a tremendous \r\nadvance that will promote peace and security in the world. For the developing \r\ncountries, our thinking should now concentrate on the future and the fate of \r\nthat democracy in other words, on how to build on the achievements stemming \r\nfrom the advent of a democratic system in a good number of countries. In \r\nother words, democracy and development are indivisible. It is only by linking \r\nthe two aspects of the question that we shall be able to derive the proper \r\nbenefits from the changes that we all nowadays recognize as significant on the \r\neve of the third millennium. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n81 \r\nMr. ABDULLAH (Malaysia): I should like at the outset to extend my \r\nwarmest congratulations to Mr. Ganev of Bulgaria on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its forth-seventh session. I am sure that with his \r\nexperience and skill he will guide the Assembly to a successful conclusion. \r\nI should like also to take this opportunity to express my deep \r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Samir S. Shahibi, who carried out his \r\ntasks with dedication and commitment. He made an invaluable contribution to \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\nIt is also a pleasure for me, on behalf of Malaysia, to extend a warm \r\nwelcome to the delegations of those countries that recently joined us as \r\nMembers of the United Nations. \r\n. In the last two to three years we have seen dramatic developments and \r\nchanges around the world. In many ways we are at a historic point, where we \r\nmust make fateful choices that will determine the future of mankind. There \r\nare opportunities to develop a new era of international cooperation based on a \r\ncollective desire to seek social and economic progress in a peaceful and \r\nstable environment. There are renewed hopes in the ability of the United \r\nNations to play a central role in the maintenance of peace and security, while \r\nat the same time being the catalyst for the revival of international \r\ndevelolpment cooperation. \r\nThe end of East-West rivalry and the success of the role of the United \r\nNations in settling a number of regional disputes understandably gave rise to \r\neuphoria about a new world order. Unfortunately, events of the last two years \r\nprove that such euphoria has been rather short-lived. Numerous and complex \r\nchallenges, as well as uncertainties, are still unfolding. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Abdullah. Malaysia) \r\nSadly, the dawn of the new post-cold-war era is looking more and more like the \r\nold world order, characterized as it was by open conflicts based on clashes \r\nbetween competing nationalists and ethnic forces. Certain parts of Europe are \r\nonce again becoming areas of tension and destruction, with ugly ethnic and \r\nnationalistic strife in the former Yugoslavia and a number of component States \r\nof the former Soviet Union. There are also disturbing unresolved local \r\nconflicts in other parts of the world in Afghanistan, Liberia, Mozambique \r\nand Somalia. \r\nIndeed, our initial hope and confidence that the end of the cold war \r\nwould encourage and bring about better cooperation at the United Nations are \r\non the wane. Experience over the last several months has raised serious \r\nconcern about certain developments at the United Nations. Too much emphasis, \r\nfor instance, is given to the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of \r\ninternational security, and there is less focus on the social and economic \r\ndimensions of peace. There is also concern over the dominant role of certain \r\npermanent members in the decision-making process in the Security Council, \r\npushing the scope of the Council\u0027s activities into areas considered by many to \r\nbe beyond its mandate. \r\nThere is also growing concern that the Security Council particularly \r\nthe permanent members - has a tendency to select when and where to apply \r\ncollective measures under the Charter to uphold the rule of law and restore \r\ninternational peace and stability. One obvious example of such selectivity is \r\nthe case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Council has yet to respond to \r\nrequests by a number of countries of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference for an emergency meeting, with formal debate, to consider the \r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, much less to invoke Article 42 of \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Abdullah. Malaysia) \r\nChapter VII of the Charter. To uphold the rule of law, the Council should \r\nreverse the aggression by Serbia-Montenegro against Bosnia and Herzegovina and \r\nshould initiate legal proceedings against Serbian leaders and individuals \r\nresponsible for \"ethnic cleansing\" and other war crimes against Bosnian \r\nMuslims and Christians. \r\nThe London Conference has yet to prove effective, and even the latest \r\nSecurity Council action, expanding the size and mandate of the United Nations \r\nProtection Force in Bosnia is limited to the protection of humanitarian \r\nrelief. It is Malaysia\u0027s strong belief that humanitarian relief, however \r\neffective it may be, will not bring an end to aggression and atrocities, which \r\nare causing so much destruction and loss of life, as well as outflows of \r\nrefugees to neighbouring countries. \r\nThe case of Bosnia and Herzegovina has highlighted the need for, and the \r\nimportance and validity of, preventive diplomacy. If the United Nations is \r\nexpected to play an effective role in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, there must be greater recourse to preventive diplomacy. \r\nSelectivity or double standards in dealing with potential conflicts and with \r\nthe parties involved would lead us nowhere and would only make a mockery of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\nWe are all conscious of the fact that the grave situation in Somalia was \r\nlargely ignored by the Security Council until the Secretary-General took the \r\nCouncil to task. Millions of Somalians have been suffering for months, and \r\nmany are dying by the day in a tragic civil war that is raging out of \r\ncontrol. Somalia is in many ways a casualty of cold-war politics and is now \r\nleft to struggle on its own. In this instance the United Nations must assist \r\nnot only in bringing humanitarian relief as is being done - but also in \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n84-85 \r\n(Mr. Abdullah. Malaysia) \r\nrestoring normality. Continuation of the civil war in Somalia is of no good \r\nto any party, and we urge the warring parties to settle their conflicts \r\nspeedily and peacefully for the sake of their people and country. There is a \r\nMalaysian proverb that aptly describes the futility of such a situation: \"The \r\nvictor becomes charcoal, and the loser the ashes.\" \r\nTwo international issues that have long been on the agenda of the United \r\nNations are Palestine and South Africa. The current Middle East peace process \r\nis showing signs of progress as, for the first time, negotiation, begin to \r\nenter into substantive questions touching on the principle of land for peace. \r\nThe time has come for the United Nations to be involved in confidence-building \r\nmeasures in the occupied territories, including the dispatch of observers, as \r\nwell as the extension of social and economic assistance beyond the current \r\nlimited efforts of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to help the Palestinians during the period \r\nof transition towards self-rule and independence. \r\nSimilarly, in South Africa, the process of change towards democracy and \r\nmajority rule has reached a critical impasse, which calls clearly for a more \r\nassertive and tangible United Nations role. Malaysia welcomes the decision of \r\nthe Security Council to send observers to help to create confidence and to \r\nfacilitate the process of change. But we believe that the United Nations \r\nshould be able to do more in extending confidence-building measures \r\nparticularly in restoring law and order as well as in looking at the needs \r\nof black South Africans living in squalid conditions, long neglected under the \r\napartheid system. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n86 \r\n(Mr. Abdullah. Malaysia) \r\nOn the question of Cambodia, Malaysia, being part of the Association of \r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the region, has a special interest in \r\nCambodia\u0027s peace, stability and economic well-being. Bilaterally, Malaysia \r\nstands ready to join hands with its Cambodian neighbours in economic and \r\ntechnical cooperation. We are also fully supportive of the United Nations \r\nrole in Cambodia and we are doing what we can to both assist and support the \r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts. To date we have already contributed a \r\ntotal number of 1,060 men to the United Nations Transitional Authority in \r\nCambodia (UNTAC). The task before UNTAC is certainly not an easy one in \r\nfacilitating the process of national reconciliation and paving the way for the \r\nsetting up of a freely elected democratic Government. Actions of some \r\nCambodian parties could well threaten the Paris peace Agreements. Clearly, \r\nthe Paris Agreements must be fully implemented and the United Nations is there \r\nto ensure such a course. Also the United Nations, as represented by UNTAC on \r\nthe ground, in its unique role in Cambodia, must gain the full confidence of \r\nall parties in order to facilitate implementation of the Agreements in the \r\npeace process. \r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in Somalia, is a serious \r\ntest of the credibility of the United Nations concept of collective security. \r\nAt a time when there is such enormous expectation concerning, and reliance on, \r\nthe United Nations collective security system to ensure the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, there is an urgent need to examine the \r\nCharter and functioning of the collective security system. Under Article 24 \r\nof the Charter, Members of the United Nations confer the responsibility for \r\nmaintaining international peace and security on the Security Council \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n87 \r\n(Mr. Abdullah. Malaysia) \r\nand the Council acts on their behalf. The general membership of the United \r\nNations surely has the right to expect transparency and accountability in the \r\nwork and actions of the Council. A major reform of the Council to achieve \r\nsuch transparency, accountability and democracy is overdue. \r\nThe Council\u0027s present membership of 15 must be increased to a level that \r\nis more representative of the United Nations general membership, which has now \r\ngrown to 179 countries. The representation of Europe in the Council far \r\noutweighs the size of Europe. The present constitution of the permanent \r\nmembership largely reflects the situation immediately after the end of the \r\nSecond World War and has now become untenable and anachronistic. The veto \r\npower which guarantees the exclusive and dominant role of the permanent five \r\nin the Council must be examined anew. Malaysia will contribute to examining \r\nin all aspects the structures of the United Nations. We regard as timely the \r\ndecision of the recent tenth non-aligned summit meeting in Jakarta to \r\nestablish a high-level working group to pursue the restructuring, \r\nrevitalization and democratization of the United Nations and will give it our \r\nfull support. \r\nMalaysia would also support a collective effort by the General Assembly \r\nto study the content and conseguence of the extremely valuable contribution of \r\nthe Secretary-General in his report \"An Agenda for Peace\". We hope that a \r\ncollective examination in a democratic fashion will help to define clearly the \r\nimportant principles contained in the document and the actions contemplated as \r\na programme of action for the United Nations in a changing world order. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n88 \r\n(Mr. Abdullah. Malaysia) \r\nThe time has also come for us to treat the financial crisis facing the \r\nUnited Nations as a matter of utmost urgency if the Organization is to be the \r\nfoundation and centrepoint of the post-cold-war world order. The increasing \r\ndemands on the United Nations to undertake peace-keeping operations around the \r\nworld are overstretching its scarce resources. Arrears for both regular and \r\npeace-keeping budgets now stand at around US$1.75 billion and they are \r\naffecting adversely the ability of the United Nations to perform its tasks. \r\nOf particular concern is the fact that more than half of the total arrears is \r\nowed by two of the five permanent members. \r\nMalaysia, like many other developing countries, welcomes the bilateral \r\nagreements reached between the United States and Russia on nuclear-weapons \r\nreduction and arms control. As a strong proponent of a universal disarmament \r\nprocess within the United Nations framework, Malaysia welcomes the positive \r\nwork of the Conference on Disarmament on the proposed chemical weapons \r\nConvention and we are happy to cosponsor a draft resolution on it at this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. Malaysia also believes that the process of \r\ntransparency and confidence-building would contribute to the general goal of \r\ndisarmament and peace, and we support the idea of a United Nations register on \r\narmaments. Such a register, however, should not be limited only to the sale \r\nand transfer of conventional weapons but should also include the production \r\nand stockpiling of conventional weapons and in due course cover \r\nnon-conventional weapons. \r\nThe suitability of the United Nations as the focal point for \r\ninternational cooperation to build a new world order is its noble objectives \r\nand universal character. For it is here that sovereign States are equal \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n89 \r\n(Mr. Abdullah. Malaysia) \r\npartners, and hence the Organization provides a good starting point for \r\ninstituting democracy in inter-State relations and multilateral diplomacy. \r\nUnfortunately, since the collapse of communism there has been an increasing \r\ntendency on the part of the victors of the ideological rivalry to dictate \r\ntheir values relating to human rights and democracy to others, not only in the \r\nconduct of their bilateral relations but also in their activities at the \r\nUnited Nations and in its bodies. Malaysia believes that a comprehensive and \r\nconstructive treatment of human rights issues must certainly take into \r\nconsideration the cultural and religious values that influence the national \r\noutlook and development of Member States. We look forward to participating in \r\nthe World Conference on Human Rights next year. \r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is an important \r\ninstrument for the maintenance of law and order in maritime affairs and for \r\ninternational cooperation. As a littoral State, Malaysia would like to draw \r\nthe Assembly\u0027s attention to the use of the Straits of Malacca as a waterway \r\nfor international shipping. Larger and faster vessels capable of carrying \r\ncargoes of a previously unimaginable magnitude now ply the Straits in record \r\nnumbers. Most of them are expected to share the same narrow waterway with \r\nfishing boats and the ever-growing number of pleasure craft. \r\nThe increasing international traffic and the passage of large \r\nsophisticated vessels through our waters have certainly landed us with new \r\nproblems, risks and responsibilities. In particular, the passage of tankers \r\ncarrying dangerous and hazardous cargo adds to our worries and the risks to \r\nour environment. There have already been cases of collisions and spillage in \r\nthe Straits, polluting our sea and shore and affecting our marine resources. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n90 \r\n(Mr. Abdullah. Malaysia) \r\nThe latest collison, last weekend, between two vessels in the Straits, \r\ninvolving an oil tanker and a container is a glaring example. When such \r\naccidents occur we have to do the clearing up, which is a financial burden, \r\nand endure the sudden harm and destruction to our marine resources caused by \r\npollution. This is too much for the poor littoral States to bear alone. \r\nObviously there is an urgent need to take a fresh look at existing \r\ninternational maritime law and regulations applicable to the Straits and find \r\na mechanism to share the responsibility of ensuring the safety of navigation, \r\nas well as collectively to combat the growing piracy with effective \r\nsurveillance through the use of advanced eguipment and with the improved \r\nresources at our disposal. To meet such objectives Malaysia is not suggesting \r\nthe introduction of levies or collection of dues but is asking for the \r\noperational and financial responsibility for this to be shared eguitably among \r\nthe maritime nations, users of the Straits and the littoral States. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n91 \r\n(Mr. Abdullah. Malaysia) \r\nAny attempt at building a new world order must address the increasing \r\ninequity in the international economic system resulting in a widening \r\nNorth-South gap. The 1992 United Nations Pevelopment Programme human \r\ndevelopment report, for instance, in highlighting the increasingly difficult \r\nexternal economic environment and its adverse repercussions for developing \r\ncountries, has stressed that the North must be held primarily responsible for \r\nthis situation. The report pointed out that protectionism and subsidies in \r\nthe developed countries resulted in a loss of $500 billion a year for the \r\ndeveloping countries, ten times what they received in foreign assistance. The \r\ntotal external debt of developing countries has multiplied thirteenfold in the \r\nlast two decades, from $100 billion in 1970 to around $1,350 billion in 1990. \r\nWhile the deadlock in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \r\nUruguay Round has yet to be resolved, recent tendencies towards unilateral \r\nprotectionist trade actions, the creation of new trade blocs and instability \r\nin the major currency markets would only worsen the already difficult global \r\neconomic environment. Nothing short of a major reform and restructuring of \r\nthe world economy, including the financial system, is required in order to \r\nbring about a strong revival and ensure its long-term stability. \r\nIn recent years some progress has been made towards revitalizing and \r\nrestructuring cooperation in the economic and social fields at the United \r\nNations. But those changes, no matter how constructive and well-meaning, are \r\nnot sufficient to revive international economic cooperation and to allow for \r\nglobal social development for as long as the developed countries are not \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n92 \r\n(Mr. Abdullah. Malaysia) \r\nprepared to initiate concrete changes at the policy level and to fulfil their \r\nobligations, particularly in terms of meeting the official development \r\nassistance targets. \r\nThe Rio de Janiero summit on environment and development has raised the \r\nhopes of many that we have, within the context of the decisions of the summit \r\nand the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Pevelopment, set the \r\nframework for launching a new global partnership with a view to economic \r\ndevelopment and the protection of the environment. However, real success is \r\ndependent upon the availability of new and additional resources as well as on \r\nthe transfer of technology from the North to the South. As agreed at Rio, we \r\nare expecting our partners in the North to make their pledges during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\nThe world today has reached a defining moment in history. The \r\nimperatives of global interdependence require that we members of the \r\ninternational community work closely together in a new global cooperative \r\nspirit to move away from the past decades of ideological confrontation towards \r\nthe building of a better world for all. In this regard the United Nations \r\nremains the best forum and vehicle for bringing about a new global consensus \r\nfor international peace, security and development. Together, as a family of \r\nnations, we must have the vision and courage to address our common interest \r\nand future. \r\nMr. ELLEMANN-JENSEN (Denmark): Let me begin by congratulating the \r\nPresident upon his election to the presidency of ihe forty-seventh session of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n93 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmark) \r\nI wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. His able and efficient leadership of the United \r\nNations since he took office only nine months ago has impressed us all and I \r\nwish to assure him of Penmark\u0027s full support of his continuing efforts to \r\nreform and streamline the Organization. \r\nDuring the past year the world Organization has become more nearly \r\nuniversal than ever. What in 1945 started out as an organization of 51 Member \r\nStates has now become an organization consisting of 179 Members. This year 13 \r\nnew States have joined the United Nations. All the new States of the former \r\nSoviet Union, as well as Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and \r\nSan Marino, have now joined the Organization. \r\nLet me take this opportunity to welcome all the new Member States and to \r\nexpress my hope for future fruitful cooperation in the spirit of the United \r\nNations. \r\nThe very deplorable developments in the former Yugoslavia have \r\ndemonstrated how fragile the situation is in many parts of the world in the \r\npost-cold-war era and have led to the largest refugee crisis in Europe since \r\nthe Second World War. The international community has reacted with great \r\nresponsibility to the intensified crisis in the former Yugoslavia and the \r\noverwhelming humanitarian needs it has caused. We have made very large \r\nresources available for monitoring, mediation and peace-keeping operations, as \r\nwell as for humanitarian assistance. I welcome the enlarged role of the \r\nUnited Nations in the peace efforts in the area as well as the central role of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the provision of relief, \r\nwhere coordination remains of paramount significance in ensuring that the \r\nrelief work is carried out with maximum speed and efficiency. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n94 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmark) \r\nDenmark has worked closely with the High Commissioner in providing very \r\nsubstantial humanitarian assistance, both financially and otherwise. Lately \r\nwe have accepted a more direct involvement in the provision of accommodation \r\nand shelter for refugees and displaced persons. We intend to continue our \r\nefforts. \r\nThe Yugoslav crisis is a crisis in Europe, and Europe is willing and able \r\nto take its part of the international responsibility, but the United Nations \r\nas the international, global actor has its important role to play as well. \r\nThe international Conference in London on the former Yugoslavia assembled all \r\nthe main actors involved in the crisis and war in the region. The results \r\nwere encouraging. The framework for the absolutely necessary political \r\ndialogue and for the negotiations was established, including the structure and \r\nthe principles upon which any peaceful solution must be based. \r\nDevelopments in the first month after the London conference have shown \r\nthat the conference was able not only to produce very good documents but also \r\nto establish the follow-up mechanism enabling us to turn words into deeds. \r\nDenmark wholeheartedly supports the efforts in Geneva under the \r\nco-chairmanship of Mr. Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. \r\nUnder the impact of all the combined international efforts - the United \r\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the European Community Monitoring Mission \r\n(ECMM), the Geneva talks we must not forget that the main responsibility for \r\nbringing an end to the cruelties and violence lies with the conflicting \r\nparties. All the peoples, groups and minorities and their leaders must \r\nrealize that the only way their communities can flourish is through a \r\nnegotiated, commonly accepted political settlement of their disputes. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n95 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmarlr) \r\nDiverging interests can coexist peacefully only through compromise. The basic \r\nprinciples for a political solution will not change: the inviolability of the \r\nborders which can be changed only by mutual, peaceful agreement; the human \r\nrights and the rights of minorities must be respected; the sanctions against \r\nSerbia-Montenegro will be upheld until the acts of aggression have stopped; \r\nthe so-called \"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" is not the sole successor to \r\nthe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; humanitarian help to all in \r\nneed shall be possible; persons who have committed crimes against \r\ninternational humanitarian law shall be prosecuted individually, if possible \r\nby an international court under the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n96 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark) \r\nThe situation in the former Yugoslavia is still grave, but I think we \r\nhave created the foundations for a possible improvement and eventual \r\nsettlement. There will be difficulties and backlashes ahead. As Prime \r\nMinister Major said at the London Conference, it will be a long haul. But \r\nnobody should doubt that Denmark, nationally as well as in its capacity as the \r\nnext holder of the Presidency of the European Community, will devote all its \r\nstrength to the international efforts aimed at obtaining a political, peaceful \r\nsettlement in the former Yugoslavia. \r\nAfter a period of impressive progress, the reform process in South Africa \r\ncame to an unfortunate standstill in the middle of this year because of new, \r\ntragic outbreaks of violence. The high level of violence remains one of the \r\nmajor obstacles to a resumption of negotiations. \r\nThe Secretary-General took an important step by sending his Special \r\nRepresentative to South Africa. As a result, a number of United Nations peace \r\nobservers have been deployed in violence-stricken areas. After a visit \r\nearlier this month by the Troika of European Community Foreign Ministers, the \r\nEuropean Community has also decided to send peace observers to South Africa. \r\nIn addition, European experts will support the work of the Goldstone \r\nCommission and other efforts to curb the violence in South Africa. \r\nAt the end of the day, however, only the South Africans themselves can \r\nbring about the new, democratic South Africa that we are looking forward to. \r\nWe stand ready to provide our fullest support. For more than 25 years, \r\nDenmark has granted humanitarian assistance to the victims of the apartheid \r\nsystem, and it is prepared to initiate a programme of transitional assistance \r\nto South Africa once an interim government is in place. We encourage the \r\ninternational community to join in the efforts to redress the social and \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n97 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmark) \r\neconomic imbalances in South Africa, and to contribute to the creation of a \r\nnon-racial and democratic South Africa. \r\nThe tragedy in Somalia amply illustrates the need for a process of \r\nnational reconciliation in that country leading to the re-establishment of a \r\nlegitimate government. Following the visit to Mogadishu by the troika of \r\nEuropean Community Foreign Ministers in early September, the European \r\nCommunity Foreign Ministers stressed this, as well as the particularly \r\nimportant role of the United Nations, in their declaration of 13 September. \r\nIn the Middle East the parties involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict and \r\nthe Palestinian guestion have embarked on a negotiating process that gives \r\ngrounds for hopes of a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement. Denmark, \r\ntogether with its European Community partners, fully supports, and remains \r\ncommitted to the peace process. \r\nThe policy adopted by the new Israeli Government has given a new impetus \r\nto this process. The subsequent response of the Arab countries and the \r\nPalestinians bodes well for the future. I sincerely hope that all parties \r\nwill now engage in substantive negotiations by building incrementally on the \r\nprogress achieved so far. Pragmatism is what counts at the present stage. I \r\ntherefore call on all parties to translate good intentions into concrete \r\nproposals and open-mindedness. \r\nIn Irag the Baghdad regime continues to ignore its obligations under \r\ninternational law by obstructing the work of United Nations inspection teams. \r\nThe regime is continuing its flagrant violations of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, in particular by victimizing Kurds and Arab Shiites \r\nliving in the marshes. And Baghdad is actively impeding the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations and non-governmental organizations to relieve the plight of \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n98 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmark) \r\nthose suffering. The harassment of United Nations peace guards, the refusal \r\nto renew the Memorandum of Understanding and the rejection of the food-for-oil \r\narrangements laid down in Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) and \r\n712 (1991) are all cases in point. \r\nSaddam Hussein\u0027s strategy, however, is doomed to failure. In no \r\ncircumstances will the international community relax the United Nations \r\nsanctions imposed on the Baghdad regime unless it fully and unconditionally \r\ncomplies with all relevant Security Council resolutions. \r\nIn my speech last autumn I pointed out how Security Council \r\nresolution 688 (1991) might become a turning point as to the balance between \r\nthe principle of national sovereignty and that of humanitarian intervention. \r\nThe guestion of humanitarian intervention has had a considerable impact on \r\ninternational debate during the last year. The course of events in Somalia, \r\nthe former Yugoslavia and recently, anew, in Irag has shown the relevance and \r\nimportance of the concept. \r\nThere seems to me to be growing support for the point of view that the \r\nprinciple of non-intervention in the internal jurisdiction of States cannot be \r\ntaken as a shield behind which massive violations of human rights can be \r\nallowed to take place, especially not where the human rights situations have \r\nbeen characterized by the Security Council as a threat to peace. A new \r\nbalance between sovereignty and international intervention is being struck, in \r\nfavour of international intervention. My Government welcomes that \r\ndevelopment. We should insist on recognition of the basic principle that \r\nGovernments have to cooperate fully to ensure access to all persons in need of \r\nassistance. Far too often political motives continue to prevent humanitarian \r\nassistance from entering a country or from reaching population groups in need \r\nof such assistance. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n99 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmark) \r\nIt has been appalling to witness the continuing disregard for \r\nhumanitarian conventions shown by Iraq during the Gulf War, and, most \r\nrecently, by parties to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The \r\nperpetrators of these criminal acts are individually responsible, and must be \r\nprosecuted individually. \r\nIn this connection I welcome the work of the International Law Commission \r\non the guestion of establishing an international criminal tribunal. The \r\nDanish Government is ready to contribute constructively in these efforts \r\nduring this and the coming session of the General Assembly. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277) \r\ncontains a number of interesting proposals, some of which Denmark can support \r\nwholeheartedly: for example, the proposal to make wider use of good offices, \r\nthe proposal to establish a reserve fund for peace-keeping operations and the \r\nproposal to make wider use of the International Court of Justice. However, \r\nboth the use of the good offices of the Secretary-General and the use of the \r\nInternational Court depend on the political will of the parties involved. \r\nThe United Nations is facing steadily growing demands for peace-keeping \r\nefforts, and the scope of these efforts is increasing. Suffice it to mention \r\nCambodia, Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the United Nations is \r\nalready heavily overburdened, we welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s call upon \r\nEuropean regional organizations to carry out peace-keeping functions in \r\naccordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter, as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nDespite the substantial Danish contribution to the United Nations \r\nProtection Force, we remain committed to further contributions to United \r\nNations peace-keeping operations, both in Europe and in other parts of the \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n100 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmark) \r\nworld. Let me add, however, that a peace-keeping operation must be seen as an \r\ninterim offer to the parties to a conflict, and thus must be limited to a few \r\nyears. A peace-keeping operation must never, by the mere length of its \r\nexistence, turn out to be an excuse for the parties not to seek a negotiated \r\nsettlement of their dispute. \r\nIn fulfilling its mandate as the guardian of peace, the United Nations \r\nhas an important role to play by contributing to social and economic \r\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty. The significant role that the \r\nUnited Nations has acquired in efforts to solve political conflicts should not \r\novershadow its responsibilities in the economic and social field. As pointed \r\nout by the Secretary-General, no lasting peace can be achieved while the \r\nexisting gap between rich and poor nations persists. \r\nThe improved international political climate, the breakup of the old \r\npower blocs and the reductions in military expenditures offer a unique \r\nopportunity to promote social development. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n101 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark) \r\nWe must now face our responsibility to improve living conditions for the more \r\nthan one billion people living in absolute poverty, and for the even larger \r\nnumber of people suffering under unemployment and social insecurity. If we do \r\nnot, problems will multiply and put global stability at risk. \r\nThe solutions to those problems must be based on respect for human \r\nrights, the rule of law and political institutions that are effective, \r\naccountable and enjoy democratic legitimacy. It is time to face, discuss and \r\ntackle these interlinking aspects of social development. \r\nDenmark welcomes the proposal adopted by the Economic and Social Council \r\nto convene in 1995 a world summit for social development. We intend to \r\npropose Copenhagen as venue for the world social summit, thereby confirming \r\nDenmark\u0027s commitment to social development and our wish to make the summit an \r\nimportant event in the mobilization of all efforts to attain the ultimate \r\nobjective to improve the quality of life of man. \r\nThis year, the General Assembly will undertake a review of the \r\noperational activities of the United Nations system. It will give us an \r\nopportunity to assess the functioning of the development activities of the \r\nUnited Nations system during the past three years, and establish new \r\nguidelines and priorities for the coming three years. At the same time, \r\ndiscussions of fundamental reforms of the United Nations system as such have \r\nentered an important stage which gives an excellent opportunity for a \r\ncomprehensive discussion of the demands of the emerging new world order as \r\nthey relate to the. structure and functioning of the United Nations and its \r\nSecretariat. \r\nAt the centre of the reform discussions is the need for a clearer \r\ndefinition of the role of the United Nations system in development activities, \r\nincluding better distribution of work and improved coordination among the \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n102 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmark) \r\nvarious organizations. The United Nations must also show leadership in this \r\nfield and carry out its own operational activities in a consistent and \r\ncoherent manner. \r\nProgress in the discussions of reforms of the United Nations operational \r\nactivities was made at the recent session of the Economic and Social Council. \r\nIt is our hope that at this year\u0027s session the General Assembly will bring the \r\nprocess forward from the level of discussing principles to that of concrete \r\naction. The proposals contained in the Nordic United Nations project would, \r\nin our view, enable the United Nations to regain its rightful leading role in \r\noperational development activities. Only through substantial changes in the \r\ngovernance and financing of United Nations funds and programmes will it be \r\npossible to ensure a more effective and efficient role for the United Nations \r\nin this field, to the benefit of developing nations. \r\nDuring the last few years, we have seen a succession of natural and \r\nman-made disasters of unprecedented frequency, scope and complexity. After \r\nthe extraordinary events of last year, we all hoped to see a reversal of this \r\ntrend in 1992. Unfortunately, such hopes have not been fulfilled. \r\nThe adoption of resolution 46/182 on emergency assistance at last year\u0027s \r\nsession was seen as a major step forward in the direction of improved \r\ncoordination within the United Nations system and increased efficiency in the \r\ndelivery of humanitarian emergency assistance. It was an important step. \r\nHowever, much more needs to be done to translate the aims of that resolution \r\ninto reality. \r\nThe public criticism which has been raised in many countries, including \r\nin Denmark, of the response of the United Nations system to the large-scale \r\ntragedy in Somalia is an example which makes it clear that this year the \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n103 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmark) \r\nGeneral Assembly must give increased and renewed attention to the issue of \r\nimproved performance by the United Nations. A determined effort must now be \r\nmade to ensure that sufficient humanitarian assistance is given in time, with \r\nmaximum speed, and in a well coordinated manner. We appeal in particular to \r\nthe organizations of the United Nations family to try harder to cooperate, act \r\njointly and compete less. \r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, scheduled to take place in June \r\nnext year, will provide an opportunity to review progress made in the field of \r\nhuman rights since the adoption of the Universal Declaration. Obstacles to \r\nfurther progress will be identified, and specific measures which can assist \r\nindividual countries in their efforts to promote respect for human rights will \r\nbe outlined. \r\nThe Danish Government is committed to ensuring a successful outcome to \r\nthe Conference, and will work for a balanced result containing both political \r\nbenchmarks and operational guidelines for corresponding implementation \r\nactivities. In this regard, special attention should be paid to the \r\ninterlinkages between democracy, human rights and development and to the need \r\nfor a concentrated assistance effort in this area, based on the principle that \r\nviolations of human rights are a legitimate concern of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\nDemocracy, respect for human rights, equal status for men and women and \r\nprinciples of good governance play an essential role in development efforts. \r\nThis has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and reflected both in \r\nthe wide-ranging reforms undertaken in a number of countries and in the \r\ncontinued policy dialogue aimed at supporting development efforts. At the \r\nsame time, the process towards broadening public participation in the \r\ndecision-making processes is bound to continue. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n104 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmark) \r\nThe Danish Government will seek to assist countries undertaking policy \r\nreforms in establishing administrative and political structures which are \r\nconducive to development for instance, by setting up new democratic \r\ninstitutions and by strengthening the rule of law. \r\nEqually we attach great importance to the question of military spending. \r\nExcessive military spending not only reduces funds available for other \r\npurposes, but can also contribute to increased regional tensions and \r\nviolations of international law, and can in some cases compromise moves \r\ntowards democracy and the rule of law at the domestic level. \r\nDenmark stands ready, through its programme for development assistance, \r\nto provide substantial support for specific activities aimed at consolidating \r\nhuman rights, democracy and good governance, and we shall seek our future \r\npartners in development from amongst countries which are making a genuine \r\neffort in this regard. \r\nNext year has also been designated the International Year of the World\u0027s \r\nIndigenous People. The Panish Government looks forward with great interest \r\nand high hopes to that Year, and plans are well under way both in Greenland \r\nand in Denmark on how to work actively towards increasing the understanding of \r\nthe special situation facing these peoples and how to further the respect for \r\nthe cultures and rights of indigenous peoples. \r\nIt is well known that the Inuit, the inhabitants of Greenland, have \r\nchosen the status of home rule within the Panish realm, and at the domestic \r\nlevel we will cooperate closely with the representatives of the home-rule \r\nGovernment of Greenland in our preparations for the Year. \r\nThe results the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \r\nrecently achieved in Rio provide a good basis for a new global partnership \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n105 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmarlr) \r\nbased on common responsibility for the Earth, even if it did not meet all our \r\nexpectations. The Rio Declaration, Agenda 21 and the Conventions on climate \r\nchange and biodiversity are far from being the end result: they are \r\ninstruments to mobilize governments and peoples from all over the world in a \r\njoint effort towards sustainable development in the future. \r\nThe most significant institutional recommendation of the Conference to be \r\nfollowed up at the international level is the high-level Commission on \r\nSustainable Development. It is important that the Commission\u0027s scope of work \r\nbe oriented towards the future in order to ensure a dynamic approach to future \r\ntechnological and economic developments. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n106 \r\n(Mr. Ellemann-Jensen. Denmark) \r\nImplementation of Agenda 21 and the conventions requires financial \r\nresources and thus calls for partnership and real burden-sharing among \r\nnations, not only between North and South but also among the donor countries \r\nthemselves. \r\nFrom the very beginning, the Danish Government has been committed to the \r\nprocess of the United Nations Conference and Environment and Development. We \r\nare prepared to provide our fair share of the necessary resources, and would \r\nlike to see similar firm commitments from as many countries as possible. \r\nAt this session we are marking the end of the United Nations Decade of \r\nDisabled Persons. The disabled remain among the most vulnerable groups, in \r\nparticular in the developing countries. During the Decade awareness of the \r\nproblems and difficulties facing disabled persons all over the world has been \r\nincreased. Much however, still remains to be done. The development \r\norganizations of the United Nations should play an important role in this \r\nrespect by integrating the needs of disabled persons more strategically in the \r\nregular programming of their activities. \r\nLet me end by stating the obvious: we all wish the United Nations \r\nsuccess in the reform process and in carrying out its many tasks. But that \r\nwish must be accompanied by a willingness to live up to our legal obligation \r\nto pay our contributions to the Organization and to do so in full and on time. \r\nPrince Mnhamed BOLKIAH (Brunei Darussalam): I congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. I am sure he will guide us well. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n107 \r\n(Prince Mohamed Bolkiah. \r\nBrunei Darussalam) \r\nI should like also to thank the outgoing President, His Excellency \r\nMr. Samir Shihabi. His valuable contribution to the work of the United \r\nNations was much appreciated. \r\nI wish also to thank the Secretary-General for his efforts on behalf of \r\npeace in the world. His report, \"An Agenda for Peace\", should be given urgent \r\nattention by Member countries. I offer the Secretary-General my continued \r\nsupport in all his demanding work. \r\nThis year, we are very pleased to greet the new Members of the United \r\nNations. Their admission should further strengthen our Organization. \r\nSince last year\u0027s session we have continued to see great changes in the \r\nworld. Brunei Darussalam welcomed most of them. However, we have approached \r\nothers with caution. This is because we are not yet sure what they will lead \r\nto. Generally, though, we feel that the Members of the world body are now in \r\na better position than ever before to build a just and lasting peace in the \r\nworld. \r\nHowever, we believe that certain things must be in place before any \r\nUnited Nations action can have a good chance of success. These are strong \r\nbilateral relationships between individual countries which lead to \r\nmultilateral cooperation through regional associations. We feel that these \r\ntwo structures are essential. It is our view that, if they exist, the United \r\nNations will be able to function well in terms of both peace-keeping and \r\npeace-building. We think they are required because no one nation or single \r\norganization is able to stand alone. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n108 \r\n(Prince Mohamed Bolkiah. \r\nBrunei Darussalam) \r\nThat is why my country, like many others, has been engaged in intense \r\ndiplomatic activity over the past year. We feel we have to establish a wide \r\nrange of bilateral relations and participate fully in regional and \r\ninternational organizations. We think that, in this way, even small nations \r\nsuch as ours can contribute a great deal to the success of this Organization. \r\nWe would like to see United Nations action complementing regional and \r\ninternational institutions. \r\nI feel that this is illustrated by the part the Association of South-East \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) has played in finding a solution to the Cambodian \r\nproblem. ASEAN\u0027s hard work and patience in the initial stages was crucial. \r\nSo were the efforts of other concerned and interested parties. Also, the \r\nwillingness of the Cambodians themselves to seek a peaceful solution was a \r\nmost significant factor. The peace accord sponsored by the United Nations was \r\nbuilt on this foundation. \r\nThe situation in Cambodia today may offer a further illustration. We \r\nbelieve it shows that peace-building does not necessarily end when an \r\nagreement is signed. The effort must still go on. A continuing spirit of \r\ncooperation among all parties to any international settlement must be \r\nencouraged. \r\nWe, therefore, see reasons for optimism in our own part of the world. \r\nBut we do not overlook realities elsewhere. We are glad to note that, even in \r\nsome very difficult situations, individual countries are trying to play their \r\npart in bringing peace and stability to their regions. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n109-110 \r\n(Prince Mohamed Bolkiah. \r\nBrunei Darussalam) \r\nWe are particularly glad to see this happening in the Middle East. The \r\npeace talks sponsored by the United States and Russia are providing the \r\ncountries concerned with the means to make peaceful progress. Certainly, the \r\ncore problem of Palestine has not yet been resolved, and we regret that the \r\nIsraelis still defy Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). \r\nBut in spite of all this, we see some progress. For this reason, we urge \r\neveryone involved to try to make the talks succeed. At the same time, we feel \r\nthat the United Nations still has an important role to play in the search for \r\na solution. \r\nWe believe that the world body should increase its effort to help bring \r\nabout peaceful change in South Africa. This would strengthen the considerable \r\nefforts made by institutions such as the Commonwealth and the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity. \r\nIn our opinion, there are sound reasons for the United Nations to be \r\ninvolved in Cambodia, the Middle East and South Africa. This is because \r\ncertain favourable conditions have been created by those directly involved. \r\nUnfortunately, this cannot always be the case. The situation in the \r\nBalkans seems likely to be typical of the dilemmas the world body may be \r\nforced to face in the future. On the one hand, there is a need to act because \r\nof our moral and human obligations. On the other hand, there may be no \r\nframework of good sense, reason and peaceful intent established at all \r\nlevels. Calls for United Nations action in similar circumstances may multiply. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n111 \r\n(Prince Mohamed Bolkiah. \r\nBrunei Darussalam) \r\nThat is why I do not feel we can consider peace and security only in \r\ntheir political context. We see them as closely linked with economic \r\ndevelopment. Here I refer to the grave social and economic problems faced by \r\na great number of developing nations. They pose a considerable threat to \r\nthose countries\u0027 internal security and, therefore, to international stability. \r\nIf present conditions continue, developing countries will be in no \r\nposition to undertake peaceful cooperation. This could mean that the United \r\nNations is called upon time and again to try to solve local conflicts under \r\nvery difficult circumstances. \r\nWe therefore think it is vital that developing and developed countries \r\nengage in peace-building together. We feel there is an urgent need to provide \r\nthe building blocks of international peace today. These take the form of \r\ncooperative international trading relations. \r\nIn my view, the first test we all face is whether we can bring about a \r\nsuccessful conclusion to the current Uruguay Round. Other things should then \r\nfall into place, such as open markets and the free transfer of modern \r\ntechnology to developing nations. \r\nThose seem to me to be the most practical ways in which we all can engage \r\nin preventive diplomacy. They will ensure that the primary role of the United \r\nNations is not only to solve political crises but also to help individual \r\nnations and regions build their own peace in their own way. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n112 \r\nMr. NASTASE (Romania): I would like first to join previous speakers \r\nin extending to Ambassador Ganev my warm congratulations on his election. It \r\ngives me particular pleasure to see the representative of one of the new \r\nEuropean democracies, which is also a friendly neighbour of Romania, heading \r\nsuch an important session. \r\nI should like also to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros \r\nBoutros-Ghali, whose tireless endeavours to catalyze our common efforts aiming \r\nat conferring on the United Nations a new role attuned to a changing world \r\nenjoy my country\u0027s full support. \r\nWithin a few days, we in Romania are going to experience a historic \r\nmoment in the post-revolutionary history of our country. On 27 September, \r\nparliamentary and presidential elections - the first since the adoption of our \r\nnew democratic Constitution will take place. We see them as a landmark for \r\na country whose firm choice of political pluralism, the rule of law, democracy \r\nand a market economy has, for the most part, been undeservedly doubted. I \r\nwant to inform the Assembly that the Romanian Government has done its best to \r\nensure a fair electoral campaign, and free and fair elections. In turn, the \r\npresence of thousands of domestic and numerous foreign observers is a solid \r\nguarantee of this. \r\nIt is not my intention to speak here and now about the heavy tolls the \r\nRomanian people has already paid on the road to a reform process able to \r\nstrike a feasible balance between legitimate aspirations and the scarcity of \r\nthe economic resources needed to meet them. But I feel entitled to say that \r\nthe incidental lapses that have sometimes seemed to jeopardize the steady \r\ncourse of transition stemmed not from attempts to look back but rather from a \r\ncertain eagerness to step into the future one day sooner. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n113 \r\n(Mr. Nastase. Romania) \r\nLike all the other new Central European democracies, Romania is \r\nundergoing a test that has no historical precedent, namely simultaneously to \r\ncreate new political structures and new, workable economic mechanisms. \r\nHowever, as our Prime Minister recently said, we have already saved ourselves \r\nfrom five years of perestroika. And we must keep on forging forward while, \r\nparadoxically, we are still searching for gradualism. Moreover, there is no \r\nsign that someone has an ideal, fool-proof blueprint for the changes we are \r\nstriving for. Thank God, it seems that Romania has already left behind most \r\nof its childhood diseases. Considering that the saying \"the sooner the \r\nbetter\" goes for measles too, we might prove in the long run to have been \r\namong the lucky ones in post-Communist Europe. \r\nTo cite just one example, I would recall that in the past year \r\nallegations concerning so-called Romanian anti-semitism have been freguently \r\nvoiced. Now, that it has become clear that they were groundless, it is our \r\nturn to be concerned that in neighboring countries and other Central European \r\ncountries, xenophobic, racist and anti-semitic trends have emerged. \r\nThe crux of the matter for our country and for other countries in \r\ntransition is to strengthen the learning capacity of society. We have no \r\ncomfortable dogmas or patterns to follow. We are courageously taking risks. \r\nThe whole process of reform has already reached the point of no return: \r\nanother reason why countries in transition should not be left alone, the more \r\nso because, in a certain sense, not only post-Communist Europe but the world \r\nas a whole is in transition. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n114 \r\n(Mr. Nastase. Romania) \r\nThe economic, moral and political investments Romania has enjoyed during \r\nthe last year have already proved that our message has been perfectly \r\nunderstood by most of our potential partners. I make no secret that such \r\ninvestments of confidence have followed an ascending curve, one corresponding \r\nboth to the growing domestic stability of Romania and our ever increasing \r\ninternational confirmation as a reliable pillar of Central European and \r\ncontinental security. \r\nSuch a positive judgement on the last year\u0027s developments in Romania is \r\nconvincingly supported by a series of parallel achievements in our domestic \r\nand our foreign policy. Let me mention just a few of our domestic \r\nachievements: the setting up of a new legislative and institutional framework \r\nable to guarantee the rule of law, political pluralism, free and fair \r\nelections, transition to a market economy and full respect for human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms; the adoption by the Parliament elected in May 1990 \r\nof the new Constitution approved by national referendum on 8 December 1991; \r\nand the fact that, according to our fundamental law, the State recognizes and \r\nguarantees to persons belonging to national minorities the right to preserve, \r\ndevelop and express their cultural, linguistic and religious identity, to \r\nwhich one can add a particular feature of Romania\u0027s Constitution, whose \r\narticle 20 states that \r\n\"constitutional provisions concerning the citizens\u0027 rights and liberties \r\nshall be interpreted and enforced in conformity with the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, and with the covenants and other treaties to \r\nwhich Romania is a party\" \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n115 \r\n(Mr. Nastase. Romania) \r\nand that \r\n\"where any inconsistencies exist between the covenants and treaties on \r\nfundamental human rights to which Romania is a party and domestic laws, \r\nthe international regulations shall take precedence\". \r\nAnother achievement is the local elections held in February 1992, \r\nconfirmed as fair and free by their main outcome: by the fact that the \r\nopposition parties won an important number of seats everywhere in the \r\ncountry. As a result, Romanian society enjoys more balanced political \r\nrepresentation, clearly contradicting allegations pointing to the danger of \r\n\"monolithism\" in Romania. The fairness of the elections was confirmed also in \r\nthe conclusions drawn by the foreign observers who witnessed the ballot. The \r\ncountry qualifies to be called pluralistic and democratic. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n116 \r\n(Mr. Nastase, Romania) \r\nThe unfolding of the current election campaign brings new proof that \r\npolitical pluralism, the rule of law, free access to the media, and freedom of \r\nspeech are becoming normal facts of life in today\u0027s Romania. All of these are \r\npromises that they will greatly contribute to the strengthening of both the \r\ninstitutional framework and its functioning, thereby irreversibly including \r\nRomania in the family of stable and democratic States. \r\nThrough adequate legislation, the building-up of economic and financial \r\nmarket mechanisms, the privatization of the land, industry, trade, services \r\nand tourism, Romania has succeeded in breaking away from the command economy \r\nand in becoming more and more attractive to foreign investors. Romania is now \r\nin its third year of transition. It has laid the foundations of a market \r\neconomy and is ready to begin structural reform. As part of the reform, the \r\nRomanian Government adopted an economic stabilization programme supported by a \r\nstand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund. The programme lays stress \r\non classical anti-inflationary measures and, at the same time, has specific \r\nelements conditioned by the need to create a market mechanism. \r\nAs a matter of principle, Romania aims at developing normal relations of \r\ncooperation with all States, and in particular with its neighbours. The \r\nforeign policy of our Government is inspired by the political will to create \r\nthe necessary conditions leading to Romania\u0027s irreversible anchorage within \r\nthe Euro-Atlantic space and its viable institutions, and, respectively, to \r\nincrease the country\u0027s contribution to the building-up of the Euro-Atlantic \r\ncommunity of values and of a new continental security order. In this spirit, \r\nRomania entered into negotiations on an association agreement with the \r\nEuropean Communities that is about to be concluded, and a cooperation \r\nagreement wiui the European Free Trade Association. At the same time, like \r\nthe other Central European countries, Romania entered into a special \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n117 \r\n(Mr. Nastase. Romania) \r\nrelationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and attaches \r\nparticular importance to its participation as a partner in the North-Atlantic \r\nCo-operation Council. \r\nThe efforts to restore and consolidate democracy in Romania cannot and \r\nshould not be isolated from the international environment in which we are \r\nliving. Our major concern about the situation in Yugoslavia has been made \r\nmanifest in many circumstances. Being in the unique position in this area of \r\nhaving never waged a fighting war against any of the peoples of the former \r\nYugoslavia, Romania is its only neighbour whose perception and attitude are in \r\nno way biased by territorial or other interests of any kind. As a State \r\nproviding full evidence of balanced conduct and good relations with all the \r\nYugoslav republics, Romania can afford to take a neutral stand on any related \r\nmatter and is determined to contribute further to the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to restore peace and stability in Yugoslavia. \r\nAs participants in the London Conference on Yugoslavia, we have stressed \r\nthat a peaceful settlement is the only acceptable alternative for all the \r\nparties to the conflict. Despite the evolution of the conflict in the \r\naftermath of the London Conference, we still believe that the relevant action \r\nprogramme adopted there is comprehensive and realistic, although peace may not \r\nbe achieved overnight. \r\nThe concerted efforts of the United Nations and the European Community, \r\nsupported by all the participants in the Conference, including Romania which \r\nis the first non-Community neighbouring country represented in the Steering \r\nCommittee - should not ignore the fact that the specific patchwork of \r\nYugoslavia has always challenged conventional wisdom. Now it also challenges \r\nthe application of the basic concepts of international law. There cannot be a \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n118 \r\n(Mr. Nastase. Romania) \r\nseparate international law for Yugoslavia. Although the conditions are \r\nhistorically and psychologically peculiar, international law is the same for \r\nall. \r\nWe may think of arrangements adapted to the specific situation and \r\nacceptable to the parties concerned. Whatever their contents, they will \r\nremain what they are one-time solutions that do not create international \r\nlaw. Given that Romania\u0027s initiative in asking for international monitoring \r\nof the observance of the embargo along our Danubian frontier with former \r\nYugoslavia has been confirmed as a positive example to be followed by other \r\nneighbors, I shall not dwell at length on this matter. But I cannot help \r\nunderlining that the costly consequences of my country\u0027s scrupulous compliance \r\nwith the resolutions of the Security Council on Yugoslavia have triggered \r\nlegitimate concerns among the population of the country. It fears that, as in \r\nthe case of the Gulf War, Romania could again economically and financially pay \r\nmore than it can afford for being a law-abiding member of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\nThat is why we would suggest that the Security Council devise a set of \r\nmeasures involving the financial institutions and other components of the \r\nUnited Nations system that can help States to meet the economic difficulties \r\nentailed by compliance with the regime of sanctions. We envisage a standing \r\ncompensation fund to be administered by the Security Council in order to \r\nalleviate, if not fully compensate for, the economic losses of countries \r\nparticularly stricken by embargoes and other sanctions established by the \r\nSecurity Council. We are in the process of working out a more detailed \r\nproposal to this effect, which we are going to submit to the United Nations \r\ncommunity for consideration. The existence of such a fund would be a way of \r\nencouraging States to cooperate with the Council in situations of crisis \r\nmanagement. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n119 \r\n(Mr. Nastase. Romania) \r\nIn the case of the conflict in the eastern part of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, we are seeing a sort of \"pacification\" that is, in fact, proving to \r\nbe a kind of blackmail for the independence and territorial integrity of that \r\nState. It is precisely the same army that generated the conflict and gave \r\narms and other support to separatist forces that today is performing the role \r\nof \"peacekeeper\". This pattern has been resorted to in other newly independent \r\nStates as well. We sometimes ask ourselves if the independence of all these \r\nformer Soviet republics is taken seriously by the international community or \r\nwhether it is only a smoke screen behind which a new imperial structure is \r\ntaking shape. \r\nIn any case, we in Romania take it seriously. We cannot remain \r\nindifferent when we see tendencies to remake the old empire, into which \r\nMoldova was forcibly incorporated as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. \r\nOur interest in the independence and democratic development of a State where \r\n65 per cent of the population is Romanian is natural. We are concerned that a \r\nwise propensity for compromise from the Moldovan leaders was rewarded with a \r\npolicy of fait accompli aimed at institutionalizing the separation of the \r\nTrans-Dniestr region from the Republic of Moldova. The evolution of the \r\nconflict in the Republic of Moldova, taken in conjunction with the conflicts \r\ngenerated elsewhere in the newly independent States, shows that nostalgia for \r\nthe former empire exists and has painful conseguences for the peoples that \r\nhave gained their freedom at so high a cost. \r\nIt is the common wisdom that the United Nations remains a major actor in \r\nthe whole process of world change and a flag-bearer of undisputable \r\nauthority. In this respect, the new lease on life given to preventive \r\ndiplomacy is crucial. An encouraging and valuable political consensus on this \r\nissue was expressed during the summit-level Security Council meeting held on \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n120 \r\n(Mr. Nastase. Romania) \r\n31 January 1992. The report of the Secretary-General \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\nincludes a set of inspired guidelines which, once adopted and implemented, \r\nwould bring us closer to the ideals the United Nations pursues in a world of \r\nturbulence. At the same time, we have to be mindful that we are contemplating \r\na long-lasting framework and that there is therefore a need to avoid ephemeral \r\nsolutions and mechanisms inspired by specific and temporary conflicts or \r\ninfluenced by emotional or short-view approaches. \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n121 \r\n(Mr. Nastase. Romania) \r\nGiven the tragic situation in Yugoslavia and other lessons drawn from \r\nrecent history, we must also forgo hasty generalizations and biased views. \r\nWisdom and patience, an even-handed attitude, and the spirit of compromise are \r\nthe necessary basic ingredients for any settlement involving the destiny of \r\npeoples. In this respect, we wholeheartedly endorse the pertinent remarks of \r\nthe Secretary-General, who says in his report that, if every ethnic, religious \r\nor linguistic group claimed statehood, there would be no limit to \r\nfragmentation, and peace, security and economic well-being for all would \r\nbecome ever more difficult to achieve. \r\nYet, we would find it extremely useful if the General Assembly were to \r\nanalyse more thoroughly the concept of the self-determination of peoples in \r\norder to prevent any distortion of this specific concept in the sense of \r\nextrapolating it to the case of national minorities. Generally speaking, we \r\nshould try to avoid a risky tendency towards a \"proliferation of principles\". \r\nOf course, some might be tempted to say that the current turmoils in different \r\nparts of the world are living proof that the principles enshrined in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter are out of date or at least incomplete. We share the \r\nview with the great majority of United Nations Member States that it is not \r\nthe principles that are wanting but the way they are put into practice. \r\nDisregard or breaches of international law favour conflicts and not a \r\nso-called \"scarcity\" of principles. \r\nThe year 1992 is a milestone year for cooperative measures aimed at arms \r\ncontrol and disarmament, transparency and confidence, strengthening \r\naction-oriented dialogue, and cooperation on security issues. The Romanian \r\nGovernment welcomes the conclusion of the Convention on the destruction and \r\nprohibition of chemical weapons and is ready to sign the Convention in \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n122 \r\n(Mr. Nastase. Romania) \r\nJanuary 1993 in Paris. We regard this Convention as a genuine pillar of \r\ninternational security. \r\nAt the same time, the set of major agreements that were signed or that \r\nentered into force this year at the European level the Treaty on \r\nConventional Forces in Europe, the Vienna Document, the Helsinki Final Act on \r\nConventional Armed Forces, and the Open Skies Treaty - have laid the \r\nfoundation for lasting cooperation and stability on the Continent. The \r\nopening in Vienna, this very week, of the Forum for Security Cooperation \r\nlaunches a further stage of the dialogue among the participating States of the \r\nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in their joint \r\nendeavour for increased security and stability for each and every country in \r\nthe Euro-Atlantic area. In addition, particular mention should be made of the \r\nhistorical processes within both the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and \r\nthe partnership established among the Western European Union (WEU) member \r\nStates and the eight countries of Central Europe, including Romania. \r\nThus, step by step, the basic components of a new security order in \r\nEurope are taking shape, taking into account the structural transformations on \r\nthe European continent. In fact, today the security of any country in the \r\nEuropean sphere cannot be conceived but as a result of harmonious interaction \r\nbetween the United Nations, CSCE, NATO and WEU, and also of increased efforts \r\nat the subregional level. \r\nWe welcome the decisions to convene the World Conference on Human Rights \r\nin 1993 and a world summit on social development in 1995. In our opinion, the \r\n1993 World Conference should represent an important occasion for putting a \r\nfinal stop to the tendencies to politicize minority issues by taking them out \r\nof their natural framework - the framework of human rights a framework which \r\noffers the best and the only viable answers to concerns connected to \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n123 \r\n(Mr. Nastase. Romania) \r\nguaranteeing and respecting the legitimate rights of persons belonging to \r\nnational minorities and to the protection of ethnic, cultural, linguistic and \r\nreligious identity. \r\nThe health of the world community vitally depends on the health of our \r\nplanet itself. The Rio Conference proved that mankind is ready to forge a new \r\npartnership for promoting sustainable development the key concept to \r\nsafeguarding human civilization. Romania is ready to put its shoulder to the \r\nwheel with a view to alleviating as soon as possible the actual threats to the \r\nhealth of our planet and to the wealth of the world community. \r\nSeeing in this audience representantives of such a great family of \r\nnations, we realize the immense potential that good will and determination can \r\noffer to the genuine universality of the world Organization. I am happy to \r\nwelcome all new States Members of the United Nations and to extend to all of \r\nthem the best wishes of my Government and the Romanian people. May I address \r\nour congratulations to the representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. I am \r\nconfident that the authoritative voice of the United Nations will be a source \r\ni for action-oriented measures for the sake and well-being of all nations. \r\nRomania, as a democratic country fully attached to the ideals embodied in \r\nthe United Nations Charter, in making its own contribution to the achievement \r\n\u003cof mankind\u0027s aspirations and to the vital answers we are expected to give to \r\n{the challenges of the forthcoming century, in which international cooperation \r\nshould be governed by law. For its cogency with the objectives of the current \r\n-United Nations Pecade of International Law, I would like to recall the \r\nA/47/PV.9 \r\n124 \r\n(Mr. Nastase. Romania) \r\nprophetic words of a great Romanian diplomat, Nicolae Titulescu, who, 55 years \r\nago, stated: \r\n\"Only when the law shines like the rising Sun in the soul of all men \r\nas a guiding spirit, an imperative requirement, and a self-imposed \r\nobligation that is one with organized freedom only then will Mankind \r\nhave been saved.\" \r\nThe meeting rose at 7.40 p.m. \r\n"
