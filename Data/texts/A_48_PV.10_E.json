May I also express\r\nthe hope that the international community will show its\r\nsolidarity and respond promptly and generously to any\r\nrequest for help.\r\nMr. ANSARI (India): On behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of India, and especially of those affected by the\r\nterrible earthquake that hit south-western India on the night\r\nof 30 September, I should like to express our profound\r\ngratitude and appreciation for the very kind words of\r\nsympathy and condolence that you, Sir, expressed on behalf\r\nof this body.\r\nThe earthquake that hit the region of Sholapur, some\r\n240 miles south-east of Bombay, has brought death and\r\ndestruction to the lives of thousands of families. The\r\nestimated death-toll at the moment is over 6,000, with\r\nmultitudes of others injured and rendered homeless by the\r\ndevastation.\r\nNatural disasters know no boundaries. Their wrath and\r\nfury do not make a distinction between developed and\r\ndeveloping or between the rich and the poor. Such disasters\r\ncannot be totally avoided. However, closer cooperation\r\nbetween all members of the international community on the\r\nexchange of information would mitigate the consequences of\r\nnatural disasters. India, for its part, is fully committed to\r\nthis task.\r\nYour message of condolence, Sir, will bring healing,\r\nsuccor and hope to the grieving multitudes that have been so\r\nprofoundly affected by the earthquake. It will strengthen\r\ntheir resolve to rebuild their lives.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. KIRO GLIGOROV, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF\r\nMACEDONIA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Former Yugoslav Republic\r\nof Macedonia.\r\nMr. Kiro Gligorov, President of the Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, His Excellency Mr. Kiro Gligorov, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident GLIGOROV: At the outset, it is my pleasure\r\nto extend to you, Sir, my sincere felicitations on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-eighth session. In discharging your important duties,\r\nyou can count on the support and cooperation of my\r\ndelegation. Your wide experience and diplomatic skills are\r\na valuable asset for the success of this important session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86647 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.10\r\n14 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\n(spoke in Macedonian; English text furnished by the\r\ndelegation)\r\nThis is the first time that my country, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, is attending a session of the General Assembly\r\nas an independent State committed to making its full\r\ncontribution to the enhancement of world peace and the\r\npromotion of internationalcooperation.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia is a country with foreign\r\npolicies based on the principles of peace, friendship and\r\ncooperation. We see the interdependence of interests and\r\nmutual respect as the future of successful international\r\ncooperation. An important element of our foreign policy is\r\nto promote good-neighbourly relations and to incorporate the\r\nprinciples of the new European architecture in the\r\ncrisis-ridden region of the Balkans. Such a foreign policy is\r\nconsistent with the internal development of the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, which is oriented towards a market economy,\r\ndemocracy, a State of law, human rights and harmony in\r\ninter-ethnic relations.\r\nBy attaining its independence in a peaceful and\r\nlegitimate manner, the Republic of Macedonia has kept the\r\npeace and forestalled a spill-over of the war into the\r\nsouthern Balkans. The comprehensive efforts of the past\r\ntwo years have changed our historic position from a bone of\r\ncontention to a factor for peace and stability in the Balkans.\r\nPursuant to this, the endeavours of the delegation of the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia in the course of this session will be\r\naimed at strict compliance with the United Nations Charter;\r\nsupport for all measures that enhance international peace and\r\nsecurity; the democratization of international relations in all\r\nspheres; the advancement of human rights and freedoms to\r\nthe utmost degree; the promotion and development of a\r\npolicy of good-neighbourly relations; forestalling the\r\nproliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction; and\r\nthe enhancement of preventive diplomacy in settling\r\ndisputes.\r\nThe adverse situation of the world today is a source of\r\nconcern to all of us. We are not fully satisfied with the\r\nefforts of our Organization nor especially with the results it\r\nhas achieved in resolving current sources of tension. We\r\naccept the assertion that the world today is not threatened by\r\na new world war and that the use of nuclear arms is not very\r\nlikely. But the fact remains that the number of serious and\r\npotential military conflicts is increasing. The efforts of our\r\nOrganization to find peaceful solutions have been enormous.\r\nRegrettably, the results have not always been productive,\r\nowing to a certain extent to the absence of a wider\r\nimplementation of preventive diplomatic measures and\r\nactivities.\r\nI take this opportunity to emphasize the extraordinary\r\nsignificance of the historical accord between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization for peace in the Middle\r\nEast and the development of world relations. All those who\r\nhave contributed to its signing deserve our special\r\nrecognition.\r\nIn this context, I am deeply convinced that, despite all\r\ndifficulties, we will soon be speaking of South Africa as a\r\nregion of successful development and human dignity. Let us\r\nhope that the forces of peace in that region will ultimately\r\nprevail over the forces of regression and apartheid.\r\nI must reiterate our deep concern over the perpetuation\r\nof the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the threat of a\r\nspill-over and a wider destabilization of our region. In dead\r\nearnest we, a country situated in the immediate vicinity, see\r\nthis as the threat of an all-out Balkan war. The situation in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is extremely grave, tragic and\r\nincomprehensible. The most terrible post-cold-war drama is\r\nunfolding in the heart of Europe: massive killings, massive\r\ndestruction, over 2 million refugees, insane acts of ethnic\r\ncleansing and genocide. Numerous international conferences\r\nand activities have been undertaken in order to bring an end\r\nto this war. The Security Council has adopted numerous\r\nresolutions. Let us all hope that peace in Bosnia will finally\r\nbecome a reality.\r\nAn end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a first\r\nand essential step. However, permanent peace in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina will not be possible without compliance with,\r\nand upholding of, the fundamental principles of international\r\nlaw, the United Nations Charter and the principles of the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),\r\nnamely that borders cannot be changed by force; that the\r\ninternational community does not recognize or accept \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\"; and that the rights of minorities must be\r\nrespected.\r\nWithout these preconditions, not only will permanent\r\npeace in Bosnia and Herzegovina be impossible, but a\r\nprecedent will be set which will incite new conflicts. To\r\ncondone the use of force and military superiority for\r\nterritorial expansion and redrawn borders would exacerbate\r\nother, less heated, tensions, especially in the ethnically\r\nmixed Balkans and the countries of Eastern Europe. It\r\nwould in fact mean condoning the potential for permanent\r\ninter-ethnic wars.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 3\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia is vitally interested in\r\nseeing an end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nforestalling a spill-over and attaining peace on lasting\r\nfoundations. For these reasons, and out of concern for our\r\nown security and for peace and stability in the region, we\r\nhave undertaken a number of timely preventive measures in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations. In this context, I\r\nwould like to stress the key role played by Security Council\r\nresolution 795 (1992) of December 1992 for the deployment\r\nof a contingent from the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) in the Republic of Macedonia.\r\nThe decision of the Security Council, to which the\r\nSecretary- General made a great contribution, has proved to\r\nbe justified, timely and efficient. It has demonstrated the\r\nenormous advantages of preventive diplomacy. The\r\npeace-keeping forces of the United Nations, strengthened by\r\nthe United States contingent, are of great importance for our\r\nsecurity and for sustaining peace and stability in the region.\r\nOur cooperation with these forces is exemplary, and it will\r\nremain so in the future. This step has greatly increased the\r\nfeelings of security and trust in the peace-keeping activities\r\nof the United Nations on the part of the citizens of the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia.\r\nAs a country and as a people, our permanent interest\r\nlies in peace and cooperation in the Balkans. In the same\r\nspirit, our efforts are aimed at establishing good- neighbourly\r\nrelations with all our neighbours and at resolving all existing\r\nproblems with our southern neighbour. The war in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, the implementation of United Nations\r\nsanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, and the remains of\r\nbloc divisions prevalent until recently prevent the Balkans\r\nfrom functioning on natural regional principles. Economic\r\nand cultural ties, communications, the free flow of people,\r\ngoods and ideas have practically been severed. This is\r\nindeed a depressing situation. In order to prepare for the\r\ntwenty-first century and a Europe of open borders and\r\ncooperation, it is essential that the Balkans undergo major\r\nchanges. This is in the interest of all the peoples and all the\r\ncountries in this region. Those are the reasons why\r\nMacedonia has adopted policies of good-neighbourly\r\nrelations, peaceful settlement of problems and development\r\nof overall economic, political and cultural cooperation\r\namong the countries of the Balkans. We are truly convinced\r\nthat, in the interest of peace and stability, the international\r\ncommunity will ardently support these processes in the\r\nBalkans. The principles of the Conference on Security and\r\nCo-operation in Europe and the processes within the\r\nEuropean Community are the only options for peace,\r\nstability and economic revival in the Balkans. However, this\r\nalso implies that all the Balkan States, which have chosen\r\nthe European option, must be enabled to achieve gradual\r\nintegration into the European Community.\r\nWe are all dissatisfied with the stagnation of the world\r\neconomy in the past year, the deterioration of the economic\r\nsituation in the world, and the economic situation in certain\r\ncountries and regions. The number of people affected by\r\nunemployment, poverty and hunger is on the rise. For\r\ndeveloped countries, recovery from the recession has been\r\nslower than expected, hindering their increased participation\r\nin the development of the developing countries and countries\r\nin transition.\r\nBecause of this situation, and because of our firm\r\nconviction that the period after the cold war must not grow\r\ninto a period of economic conflicts, we believe that much\r\nmore can be done to seek a way out of the world’s current\r\neconomic and social difficulties. In this context, I am\r\nconvinced that the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly will serve as firm encouragement for an increase\r\nin world demand and for liberalization of world trade. A\r\nvery important prerequisite for the realization of this goal is\r\nthe successful outcome of the Uruguay Round of the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations,\r\nencouraged by the Tokyo summit. It is also essential to\r\nresolve the issue of arrears and that of access by developing\r\ncountries and countries in transition to international financial\r\nmarkets. All of these activities support the view that only\r\ndevelopment generates new development, while stagnation\r\nbrings only regression and poverty.\r\nEnhanced protection of human rights is justifiably\r\nreceiving greater priority in the work of our Organization.\r\nWe are concerned by the fact that in the past year, violations\r\nof human rights have reached epidemic proportions. We feel\r\nthat the Vienna Conference on Human Rights is a very\r\npositive step in the right direction, and we hope that the\r\nDeclaration and Action Programme adopted at that\r\nConference will contribute greatly to ending the\r\nunfavourable developments in this area today.\r\nThe negotiations in Vienna have clearly shown that\r\ncurrent mechanisms for implementing existing human-rights\r\ninstruments are not efficient, and that much improvement is\r\nneeded, particularly in the rights of ethnic, religious and\r\nlinguistic minorities. A significant step in this direction has\r\nbeen taken by the adoption last year of the Declaration on\r\nminorities. The next steps which our delegation will support\r\nare the commencement of operations of the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights according to the Declaration on the Rights of\r\nPersons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and\r\nLinguistic Minorities, and an examination of the need for\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsetting up a United Nations high commission for minorities,\r\nwith headquarters in Geneva.\r\nI would like to point out that all unresolved issues\r\ninvolving ethnic minorities can well lead to future military\r\nconflicts, particularly in certain regions of the world, thus\r\nendangering international peace. Hence it is essential to take\r\nimmediate preventive measures in this area as well.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia is a European country in\r\ntransition, a landlocked country, a country of transit and a\r\ndeveloping country. These factors contribute to the\r\neconomic difficulties of my country. The situation is further\r\ncomplicated by the consequences of the United Nations\r\nsanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro. I would\r\nimmediately like to emphasize that we have strictly complied\r\nwith the implementation of the sanctions. As a result, this\r\nyear alone, our gross national product has been cut in half.\r\nExternal trade has been reduced considerably, transport costs\r\nhave increased immensely, and other indirect damage has\r\noccurred as well.\r\nToday, the survival, democracy and economic\r\ndevelopment of the Republic of Macedonia are\r\nfundamentally dependent on assistance from the international\r\ncommunity. Otherwise, it is very possible that social\r\ntensions, and the probable collapse of the economy, will\r\nbring about a new crisis spot. I am deeply convinced that,\r\nin accordance with Article 50 of the Charter and Security\r\nCouncil resolution 820 (1993), the United Nations and the\r\nSecurity Council will be in a position to provide us with\r\nconcrete forms of assistance.\r\nIt is inconceivable to expect a small country to bear the\r\ndamage of an international action of this type on its own,\r\nwithout solidarity and timely assistance. Aid should be\r\nprovided now as a preventive measure, instead of after the\r\noutbreak of those likely social clashes which may grow into\r\nnew conflicts.\r\nIn this spirit, the delegation of the Republic of\r\nMacedonia at this session will lay out our direct proposals\r\nregarding the problem of compensation for damage incurred\r\nas a result of implementing the sanctions, the problems\r\nderiving from the position of landlocked countries, and other\r\nissues related to peace and cooperation.\r\nThe strengthening of the United Nations in all aspects,\r\nin the post-cold-war period, is of vital importance to the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia. My country belongs to a group of\r\ncountries that can survive and develop only in conditions\r\nwithout war, in a world where peace and stability are not\r\nthreatened, where international cooperation will be conducted\r\nwithout obstacles and discrimination, and a world where\r\neveryone will have respect for human dignity.\r\nIn this context, the delegation of the Republic of\r\nMacedonia will make its full contribution to the successful\r\nwork of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly\r\nand to strengthening the Organization.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nPresident Gligorov of the Former Yugoslav Republic\r\nof Macedonia was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. EMOMALI RAKHMONOV,\r\nCHAIRMAN OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE\r\nREPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Emomali Rakhmonov, Chairman of the Supreme\r\nCouncil of the Republic of Tajikistan, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nChairman RAKHMONOV (Tajikistan) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): The year that has elapsed since the forty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly was noteworthy for\r\nthe further growth in the authority and the effectiveness of\r\nthe United Nations. It testifies, in our view, to the deep\r\nunderstanding that the members of the world community\r\nhave about the need for close, constructive cooperation in\r\nthe name of a better future. As I look around this Hall, in\r\nwhich, for the first time, a Head of State of a sovereign\r\nTajikistan is speaking, the words of the great poet Saadi\r\ncome to my mind:\r\n\"The sons of Man are but one body\r\nFor the Creator made us all from but one beginning\".\r\nNow that I find myself here, in the centre for settling\r\nthe problems of the whole world, I should first of all like to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Samuel Insanally, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Guyana, on his election to the presidency\r\nof the General Assembly. Allow me to express the hope\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 5\r\nthat this session, under your skilful leadership, Mr. President,\r\nwill achieve tangible, successful results for the good of all\r\nmankind. I should also like to draw attention to the\r\nexcellent work done by Mr. Stoyan Ganev, President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its last session; Mr. Ganev both\r\nenergetically and effectively guided the deliberations on\r\ncomplex political problems.\r\nIt is with great satisfaction that I greet\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, and express to him our sincere gratitude for his\r\ntireless efforts to resolve the conflicts in various parts of the\r\nworld, not excluding my own country.\r\nThe Republic of Tajikistan is taking its first steps as a\r\nsubject of international law. It is with deep satisfaction that\r\nI note that we have been granted an equal voice in the\r\ncommonwealth of nations, and we are aware that this\r\nhonourable right imposes significant duties on us.\r\nThe two years of our independence, in addition to\r\nmoments that are undoubtedly positive, have also entailed\r\nthe harsh trials that my patient and peace-loving people are\r\nnow going through. It is for the historians to study the root\r\ncauses, the reasons for the situation in Tajikistan today. I\r\nthink that my job is to point out just one thing: those whom\r\nwe believe, on the basis of the law in force in the Republic\r\nof Tajikistan, to be guilty of unleashing civil war are guilty\r\nof grossly violating the very foundations of any modern\r\nsociety, namely the primacy of law.\r\nAs in any civil war, in the civil war in Tajikistan there\r\ncan be no victors. Our urgent task as a nation is to heal, as\r\nquickly as possible, the bloody wounds that it has inflicted\r\non our country.\r\nThe attention the community of nations is paying\r\nTajikistan is understandable. Nor should we be surprised at\r\nthe variety of opinions we hear when events in the Republic\r\nare being analysed. I should like to shed some necessary\r\nlight on a number of issues.\r\nNow that we have set out on the path of independent\r\ndevelopment, we have run up against the enormous political\r\nand socio-economic problems of the transitional period.\r\nOur national economy was built up as just one small\r\npart of the enormous economic complex of the former\r\nUSSR, and was basically a provider of raw materials. With\r\nthe collapse of those economic ties, our Republic has come\r\nface to face with many almost insoluble problems. There\r\nhas been a catastrophic drop in the standard of living, which\r\ncould hardly fail to lead to an increase in social tension.\r\nThe power struggle that developed at the same time and\r\nthe attempts to seize power illegally, by force and\r\nundemocratically, have split society apart and led to a\r\nsenseless, fratricidal war. The results of this we know:\r\nthousands of broken lives, thousands of dead and wounded,\r\nrefugees and missing. Immeasurable political, social and\r\neconomic harm has been done to the Republic.\r\nThe internal instability has become the main reason for\r\nthe economic and political chaos, the total legal confusion\r\nand the sharp drop in production. The future of our people -\r\nthe future of Tajik statehood - has been put in jeopardy.\r\nThe sixteenth session of the Supreme Council of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, which was held in these conditions,\r\nlaid fundamentally new foundations for establishing peace\r\nand civil harmony in our country. The Supreme Council has\r\ndecided in favour of solving all political, social and\r\neconomic problems solely within the framework of the\r\nconstitution. A number of important laws have been adopted\r\nthat are designed to afford citizens social protection and to\r\nreturn them to their homes and peace-time jobs.\r\nIn accordance with the Constitution, we have elected a\r\nleadership for the Supreme Council and formed a\r\nGovernment. Today our society and our people have\r\nbecome aware that the highest power in the State should be\r\nthe law, and only the law.\r\nAs the Head of State, I declare, from this rostrum, that\r\nwe shall adhere to the fundamental principles of the Final\r\nAct of the Helsinki Conference and the Paris Charter and\r\nother international instruments for the defence of law. We\r\nare determined to carry out democratic transformations in\r\nour country and to acknowledge and respect philosophical,\r\nreligious, ideological and political choice as an inalienable\r\nright of the individual.\r\nWorking under the constant pressure of political and\r\nsocio-economic problems, we have succeeded in a short time\r\nin removing the economic blockade from all the regions of\r\nthe Republic and have begun rebuilding our destroyed\r\nnational economy and instituting economic reforms in order\r\ngradually to introduce a free market.\r\nFrom the beginning of the restoration of our Republic,\r\nour Parliament has adhered to the principle of the primacy\r\nof law, and in so doing has passed a number of measures,\r\nwhile the Presidium of the Supreme Council has laid down\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthree special decrees on amnesty. Does not this show that\r\nwe are acting to resolve through political means the\r\nproblems that have accumulated in our country? We are\r\nprepared for dialogue with all the social forces in our\r\ncountry to achieve national reconciliation, civil harmony and\r\nstability in Tajikistan.\r\nWe would like to cooperate constructively with forces\r\nof any political orientation acting within the framework of\r\nexisting law and respecting generally accepted principles of\r\ndemocracy. I would like to inform the world community\r\nthat Tajikistan is actively working to improve its election\r\nlaws and to prepare a draft new Constitution in which\r\nmaximum attention will be given to all problems related to\r\nguaranteeing and protecting inalienable human rights.\r\nIn terms of settling our domestic political problems, we\r\nare seriously concerned over the attempts at regionalization\r\nof the internal conflict in Tajikistan, a conflict which is still\r\ngoing on in a number of areas along the Tajik-Afghan\r\nborder. The outbreak of the conflict this summer brought\r\ndozens of deaths.\r\nAllow me briefly to tell the Assembly my view of the\r\nessential reasons for the tensions along and inside the border.\r\nEveryone knows that until recently Tajikistan had been\r\nsystematically subjected to unprovoked acts of armed\r\nintervention from the territory of a neighbouring country.\r\nNaturally, we understand its internal difficulties related to\r\nestablishing a centralized State administration. But facts\r\ncannot be denied, and we have now been faced with the\r\nneed seriously to deal with the question of self-defence.\r\nWe are not hatching any hostile plan with regard to\r\nAfghanistan. The measures which we have taken and are\r\ntaken to strengthen the defence of our border - which is also\r\na border of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) -\r\ndo not go beyond what is laid down in Article 51 of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and are fully in keeping with\r\ngenerally accepted norms of international relations.\r\nBut this, of course, does not mean that that is the only\r\nway to solve the problem. And here we are encouraged by\r\nthe notable speed-up in the negotiating process with the\r\nauthorities in Kabul. We have achieved a number of\r\npositive agreements on a broad spectrum of questions,\r\nincluding normalizing the situation along the Tajik-Afghan\r\nborder. We think that a permanent, substantive dialogue\r\nwith the leadership of the Islamic State of Afghanistan will\r\nhelp us remove some other well-known irritants.\r\nIt is most unfortunate that huge resources are still being\r\nspent to support destructive elements based on the territory\r\nof Afghanistan. Having gone there from Tajikistan, they are,\r\nwith the help of extremist groups and the forces of\r\ninternational terrorism, hatching plans forcibly to change the\r\nState structure in our country. A legitimate question arises:\r\nis it not wiser to use these resources to build rather than to\r\ndestroy?\r\nAnother of our problems is that of the Tajik refugees in\r\nAfghanistan. There are many versions of how they ended up\r\non the territory of Afghanistan, but that is not the main\r\npoint, which is that they should return to their homeland as\r\nquickly as possible. We express our sincere thanks to the\r\nAdministration of Afghanistan and to the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, who are giving serious\r\nattention to those people. As of the middle of September,\r\nmore than 35,000 Tajik refugees - more than half the total -\r\nhad returned to their permanent homes from Afghanistan.\r\nWe hope that the process of voluntary return will continue\r\nand that with the support of the authorities of Afghanistan\r\nand of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,\r\nwe shall in the near future be able to put an end once and\r\nfor all to this painful question.\r\nWe have already completed our preparation for signing\r\na trilateral agreement between Tajikistan, Afghanistan and\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We\r\nhope that the agreement will be signed as soon as possible.\r\nFrom this United Nations rostrum, I should like to say\r\none more thing in this regard. We are firmly convinced that\r\nthe support of the Administration of Afghanistan in efforts\r\nto restore peace to the Afghan land, which has suffered so\r\nmuch, would be in the interests not only of that country but\r\nof the region and of the entire world. There was a time\r\nwhen some States spent a great deal of resources on war in\r\nAfghanistan. In my view, the time has come to help restore\r\na peaceful life there. A restless, unstable Afghanistan is a\r\nthreat - and not only to Tajikistan.\r\nRegarding our participation in the CIS, I must\r\nemphasize that Tajikistan is in favour of strengthening the\r\nCommonwealth while observing full respect for the\r\nsovereignty and independence of its member States. In this\r\ncontext, I should like to point out the significance of two\r\nareas of our activities within the framework of the CIS,\r\nactivities which are critically important for Tajikistan. I am\r\ntalking about relations with Russia and with the Central\r\nAsian States.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 7\r\nRussia, as a permanent member of the Security Council,\r\nhas undergone great trials in taking upon itself the\r\nmaintenance of peace and stability in virtually all the space\r\nand territory of the former Soviet Union. Therefore, the\r\npeoples of the former Soviet Union, including Tajikistan,\r\ncommend and welcome the peace-keeping efforts made by\r\nRussia.\r\nA positive role in stabilizing the situation in our country\r\nhas been played by the brotherly support of Uzbekistan,\r\nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. Tajikistan also thanks\r\nthe United States and all the other countries of Europe and\r\nAsia that extended the hand of assistance to us during\r\nterrible and dark days.\r\nWe hope that Tajikistan will quickly be removed from\r\nthe blacklist of conflict areas. In this respect, we count upon\r\nthe tangible assistance of the world community in restoring\r\nour national economy, which has been destroyed by war and\r\nby natural disasters. A country which is rich in natural\r\nresources, which has an attraction in terms of its economic\r\nprospects, needs purposeful assistance in order to be reborn.\r\nAllow me to express the hope that that assistance and that\r\nsupport will naturally, in accordance with generally accepted\r\nprinciples in world practice, be given to my country.\r\nTajikistan, which has gone through the horrors of a\r\ncivil war, views with great concern the course of events in\r\nthe hot spots of our planet. We know of the pain and\r\nsuffering of the people of Somalia. We feel the full depth\r\nand senselessness of the tragedy of the peoples of the former\r\nYugoslavia, the deadlocked events which have taken place\r\nin the Caucasus of the post-Soviet era. We also know\r\nfirsthand how destructive is the force of local conflicts. That\r\nis why we make an urgent appeal to the world community\r\nto multiply its efforts to end, and to prevent, that type of\r\nconflict. We are firmly convinced that the force of arms, no\r\nmatter how threatening and frightening they may be, cannot\r\nsolve a single contentious issue.\r\nIn this connection, we are seriously concerned by the\r\nuncontrolled and unsanctioned trade in arms in areas of\r\nintense instability. Essentially, what is happening is a\r\nmassive arming of entire regions. Indeed, we can imagine\r\nhow unbelievably difficult it is to take away from a\r\npopulation weapons that they have illegally obtained. On\r\nthe basis of our own bitter experience, we loudly speak out\r\nabout the danger of that fateful trend.\r\nToday, this destructive impact on our economy has\r\nbeen joined by another: the aspiration of a number of\r\ncountries to acquire nuclear weapons or the technology to\r\nproduce them. As a country which has the technology for\r\nmining and initially processing uranium, we categorically\r\noppose the use of that priceless source of energy for\r\nnon-peaceful purposes.\r\nWe state our unconditional support for the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty, and we hope that the conference of\r\nthe States parties to that Treaty, scheduled for 1995, will\r\ndecide to extend it indefinitely.\r\nAs the Assembly knows, the end of the cold war and\r\nbipolar confrontation gave rise to great hopes on the part of\r\nthe peoples of the world. Unfortunately, events have not yet\r\njustified many of these hopes. None the less, there is one\r\nplace in the world where notable political events have been\r\nobserved. We are deeply satisfied with the historic\r\nagreements reached between the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization and the State of Israel on mutual recognition.\r\nWe welcome the decision of the United States of\r\nAmerica to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization,\r\nand we commend that great country for its role in supporting\r\npeace and stability on earth.\r\nThe questions which the General Assembly will be\r\ndiscussing at its forty-eighth session show that there is now\r\nan onward rush towards the interdependence of nations. In\r\nTajikistan we are convinced of this.\r\nWe commend the peace-keeping and humanitarian\r\nefforts of the United Nations. We are especially proud of\r\nTajikistan’s initiative to include institutions of the\r\nCommonwealth of Nations in the broad peace-keeping\r\nactivities on the territory of our country; that initiative has\r\nnot been ignored.\r\nThe mandate for the presence in Tajikistan of the\r\nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ismat Kittani,\r\nhas been extended. The Republic has fruitfully worked with\r\nthe United Nations Observer Mission, the representative of\r\nthe High Commissioner for Refugees, and the representatives\r\nof other international non-governmental organizations.\r\nOur special gratitude goes to the Security Council of\r\nthe United Nations, which constantly monitors developments\r\nin the situation in and around Tajikistan. We sincerely hope\r\nthat the efforts of the community of nations will be\r\nincreasingly focused on ensuring the conditions for\r\nsustainable development.\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nWe wholeheartedly support the principles and\r\nrecommendations of Agenda 21. We feel that accomplishing\r\nthat Agenda’s important goals, such as the transfer of\r\ntechnology and resources, will have a favourable impact on\r\ndisaster areas such as the Aral Sea and areas of great\r\npoverty.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to assure the Assembly that\r\nmy people, who have now embarked upon establishing their\r\nown statehood and have overcome considerable difficulties\r\nin so doing, look to the future with a feeling of great and, I\r\nhope, justified optimism.\r\nWe will spare no effort, we shall use all our energy, in\r\nbuilding a genuinely legal, democratic and enlightened State\r\nwhich will not fail to take a worthy place among the\r\ncivilized countries of the world.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chairman of the Supreme\r\nCouncil of the Republic of Tajikistan for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Emomali Rhakmonov, Chairman of the Supreme\r\nCouncil of the Republic of Tajikistan, was escorted from\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. ISAIAS AFWERKI, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE STATE OF ERITREA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the State of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Isaias Afwerki, President of the State of Eritrea,\r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the State of Eritrea, His Excellency\r\nMr. Isaias Afwerki, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident AFWERKI: Let me begin by congratulating\r\nyou, Sir, upon your election to the presidency of the forty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI feel particularly privileged and honoured to address\r\nthe General Assembly on behalf of a people that struggled\r\nfor half a century to regain its fundamental human and\r\nnational rights and that, despite the outright military victory\r\nit won, took the unprecedented step of organizing a free and\r\nfair referendum so as to join the community of independent\r\nStates on the basis of its freely expressed wish and on solid\r\nlegal grounds.\r\nAs I speak here today, I cannot help but remember the\r\nappeals we sent year in and out to the General Assembly\r\nand the States Members of the United Nations, describing\r\nthe plight of our people and asking for legitimate sympathy,\r\nsupport and recognition. We appealed to the United Nations\r\nnot only in its capacity as a representative of the\r\ninternational community, but also because of its special\r\nresponsibility to Eritrea. For it was the United Nations that\r\ndecided in 1950, at the beginning of the cold war, to deny\r\nthe colonized people of Eritrea their right to\r\nself-determination, thereby sacrificing their national and\r\nhuman rights on the altar of the strategic interests of the\r\nsuper-Powers.\r\nIn adopting that resolution, the United Nations affirmed\r\nthat it remained an international instrument which the\r\nGeneral Assembly could be seized of at any time. But for\r\nthe next 41 years, as a brutal war of aggression was\r\nconducted against the Eritrean people, initially with the\r\nactive support of the United States and later with a much\r\nworse and massive involvement of the Soviet Union, and\r\ndespite the repeated appeals of the Eritrean people, the\r\nUnited Nations refused to raise its voice in the defence of a\r\npeople whose future it had unjustly decided and whom it had\r\npledged to protect. Not once in 41 years did Eritrea, scene\r\nof the longest war in Africa, and victim of some of the\r\ngrossest violations of human rights, figure in the agenda of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThis deafening silence pained our people. It also gave\r\na free hand to the aggressors, thereby prolonging our\r\nsuffering and increasing the sacrifices we had to make. But\r\nit neither shook our resolve nor undermined our belief in the\r\njustness of our cause and the inevitability of our victory. As\r\nan Eritrean proverb says: \"The rod of truth may become\r\nthinner but it cannot be broken.\" Indeed, justice has finally\r\nprevailed. This is a source of hope and happiness not only\r\nfor the Eritrean people, but for all those who cherish justice\r\nand peace.\r\nWhile we rejoice at the peace and freedom that have\r\nbeen attained and the promising prospects that lie ahead, we\r\nare confronted with the reality of a devastated country and\r\npopulation. The extent of the physical and economic\r\ndestruction visited on our country, in terms of infrastructure,\r\nindustry, agriculture, education and health services, as well\r\nas the more painful human losses - the death of over\r\n150,000 people, the exile of a quarter of the population,\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 9\r\nmassive displacement, and over 100,000 disabled and\r\norphaned - are appalling by any standard, especially when\r\nmeasured against the meagre resources and small size of our\r\npopulation.\r\nFormidable as our problems are, we are confident that\r\nwe can and will rebuild our devastated country and provide\r\na decent life for ourselves. It is our firm conviction that\r\noutside assistance, no matter how generous, cannot of itself\r\nsolve our problems. Ultimately, deliverance will depend on\r\nour own efforts, on the mobilization and efficient utilization\r\nof our resources. But as we start to clear the rubble and\r\npick up the pieces after three decades of war and destruction,\r\nwe find that our resources are too limited for the awesome\r\ntask of rehabilitation and jump-starting our economy. We\r\ncannot help but ask: Will the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community come to our assistance this time or\r\nwill our pleas once again go unheeded?\r\nAt this critical juncture of its history, Eritrea needs and\r\ndeserves international support and assistance, not only\r\nbecause the United Nations and the international community\r\nbear special responsibility for Eritrea, but also because it is\r\na test case for the United Nations \"Agenda for Peace\" and\r\nthe whole concept of peace-building. Eritrea has not only\r\nsecured peace and stability; it has made the rare achievement\r\nof establishing warm relations of cooperation with its former\r\nenemy, Ethiopia. And it is tackling the task of\r\nreconstruction with popular support and participation, with\r\ncommitment and determination, with sound and flexible\r\npolicies, with prudent and efficient utilization of limited\r\nresources, and with a demonstrated readiness to promote\r\nregional understanding and cooperation.\r\nUnfortunately, the response of the United Nations and\r\nthe international community so far has not been encouraging.\r\nThough the active involvement of the United Nations in the\r\nreferendum was generally commendable, United Nations\r\ncontributions to the Eritrean referendum - one of the most\r\nsuccessful electoral processes in which the United Nations\r\nhas ever been involved - was less than $2 million, a meagre\r\nsum compared to the tens of millions of dollars devoted to\r\nsimilar exercises, many of which were dismal failures.\r\nSimilarly, the response of the international community to the\r\nprogramme for the repatriation of half a million Eritrean\r\nrefugees from the Sudan fell far short of reasonable\r\nexpectations, and the Government has found no alternative\r\nbut to start the programme regardless of funds and expected\r\nproblems. Eritrea has also embarked on a crucial\r\ndemobilization programme - it has demobilized close to one\r\nthird of its 90,000-man army in the first phase - without\r\nUnited Nations or other contribution. It had to cut back\r\nsome of its rehabilitation and development projects and\r\nborrow money to finance this first phase.\r\nIn our efforts at mobilizing international resources, we\r\nhave repeatedly been met with such excuses as \"a lack of\r\nfunds\", \"competing demands\", \"more pressing priorities\" and\r\n\"donor fatigue\". There well may be some truth in all of this.\r\nAnd we are appreciative of the constraints and commendable\r\nefforts of some donors. But, I believe, we cannot and\r\nshould not hesitate to acknowledge that, by and large, the\r\ninternational aid programme is deeply flawed, unfair, unjust\r\nand ill-structured to respond to the vital needs of recipient\r\ncommunities. Assistance and the amounts of assistance\r\nappear to be decided, not on the basis of need or the\r\ncapacity to put the assistance to good use, but - even after\r\nthe proclamation of the end of the cold war - on the basis of\r\nthe interests and agendas of donors. Moreover, the\r\ninternational community tends to be more responsive to\r\nputting out fires than to preventing them, and once the fires\r\nare put out it often turns its back on the smouldering\r\ncombustible remains.\r\nOne of the most disquieting features of the present\r\ninternational situation is the marginalization of the entire\r\ncontinent of Africa. Every indicator shows that Africa is\r\nsliding back and being left behind, which results in\r\nintolerable poverty, suffering and desperation for millions of\r\nits people. There is no denying that the onus of the\r\nresponsibility for these problems falls first and foremost on\r\nus Africans. But, I believe, the international community\r\nmust squarely face the fact that it also bears responsibility\r\nfor Africa’s plight. Many of the dictators who have sown so\r\nmuch havoc and suffering were in fact brought to power and\r\nsustained during the years of the cold war by sections of the\r\ninternational community. Perhaps more significant is the\r\nfact that the now discredited economic policies and failed\r\nprojects were generally designed and approved by\r\ninternational donors and implemented under the direction of\r\nan army of foreign experts and advisers.\r\nIn our present highly interlinked world, Africa’s\r\nmarginalization, the poverty and desperation of its people, of\r\nits youth, cannot be walled in within the continent’s\r\nboundaries. They are bound to threaten global prosperity\r\nand stability. The frustration and resentment that continue\r\nto swell and may well explode must be defused in time.\r\nOnce again Africa must seize its own destiny. Its people\r\nand leaders must tap deep into their human and material\r\nresources and come up with the wisdom, strategy and\r\ncommitment to lift Africa from the mire. But as they set out\r\non this difficult road the international community needs to\r\ncome to their assistance, not with hand-outs that only\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nincrease dependency, not with the familiar packages and\r\nprojects that have gone down the drain, not with\r\npreconceived formulas and attitudes of \"We know what is\r\nbest\", but in a spirit of partnership dedicated to helping\r\nAfrica to stand on its own feet and contribute to the\r\nenrichment of human life and the protection of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nOf course, not everything in Africa has been bleak.\r\nJust as gross human failure is not limited to Africa - witness\r\nevents in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Soviet Union\r\nand elsewhere - Africa has its share of positive and uplifting\r\ndevelopments and successes. We are following with much\r\ninterest the determined and promising efforts of several\r\nAfrican countries, both at the individual country level and\r\nwithin a regional context. Despite the neglect and inequities\r\nof the international community, many African peoples are\r\nmaking a determined assault on poverty and social injustice.\r\nIn our part of the continent, Eritrea and Ethiopia have\r\nalready started mutually beneficial economic cooperation,\r\nand, together with the other countries of the Horn, are\r\nworking to set up a regional mechanism to foster peace and\r\ncooperation. We strongly believe all of the many positive\r\ndevelopments in Africa should be duly recognized.\r\nIn view of the positive developments in the Horn of\r\nAfrica, the tragedy that has gripped Somalia has been\r\nprofoundly disturbing. As the bloodletting among our\r\nSomali brothers assumed harrowing proportions, and at a\r\ntime when many were hesitating, we strongly advocated the\r\nconstructive intervention of the international community,\r\nunder the umbrella of the United Nations, to save lives and\r\nhelp extricate Somalia from the destruction it was heading\r\nfor. Despite our opposition in principle to external military\r\nintervention, we realized early on that the extraordinary\r\nsituation in Somalia demanded extraordinary measures.\r\nIt was therefore with great relief that we welcomed the\r\ndecision of the United States Administration to intervene in\r\nSomalia. Encouraged, we sought - individually and in\r\nconjunction with our regional partners - to ensure that the\r\nintervention would be guided by clear and comprehensive\r\nsecurity, and humanitarian and political objectives. And we\r\ndid not hesitate to share our views on the size, type and\r\nlength of stay of the intervention force needed for the\r\nsuccess of the mission. But unfortunately our views were\r\nnot heeded, although we were, and still are, better placed to\r\nunderstand and work in the realities of neighbouring\r\nSomalia.\r\nBe that as it may, we recognize and appreciate the\r\nachievements of the international intervention in Somalia.\r\nThe improvement of the humanitarian situation and the\r\nMarch 1993 Addis Ababa Accords on national reconciliation\r\nare major steps forward. At the same time, the worsening\r\nsecurity situation in Mogadishu and the increasing toll in\r\nhuman lives, including women and children, have cast a long\r\nshadow on the intervention in Somalia. Repeated mistakes\r\nin handling the situation have led some people openly to call\r\nfor an immediate end to the intervention.\r\nIt is our conviction that a precipitate withdrawal of\r\nUnited States troops - which we strongly warned against\r\nfrom the beginning - would not only signal a lack of United\r\nStates commitment to the intervention, but would eventually\r\nmake the position of the United Nations Operation in\r\nSomalia (UNOSOM II) untenable. This would plunge\r\nSomalia into a catastrophe much worse than the anarchy that\r\nprompted the intervention in the first place. We therefore\r\nurge the United States and the international community at\r\nlarge to stay the course in Somalia and to shoulder their\r\nresponsibility to the Somali people in the hour of their\r\ngreatest need. We also urge them to review, frankly and\r\ndispassionately, the intervention to date, build on the\r\nsuccesses and achievements and, more importantly, admit\r\nand correct mistakes.\r\nWe sincerely believe that the countries of the region,\r\nwhose role has so far been deliberately or otherwise\r\nneglected, can make a constructive contribution to the\r\ninternational effort. Consulting them informally every once\r\nin a while, as has been the case in the past, is clearly not\r\nenough. They need to become part of the process in a more\r\nmeaningful and formalized way, as it concerns and affects\r\nthem directly and more than anyone outside the region.\r\nThe advent of the new State of Eritrea happily\r\ncoincided with the end of the cold war, that era of\r\nsuper-Power rivalry that caused so much human misery and\r\nled to the virtual paralysis of the United Nations. Like the\r\nrest of humanity, we place much hope on the new era, on\r\nthe prospects of an enhanced role for the United Nations, a\r\nrole that would make it truly representative of \"We, the\r\npeoples of the world\". And yet we have no illusions that a\r\nnew, just and equitable world order has dawned. We see too\r\nmany old habits and practices - inside the United Nations\r\nand outside it - to entertain any illusions. Although we hope\r\nfor successes, we see that the failures of United Nations\r\ninitiatives far outnumber any of its successes. Injustice\r\nendures within nations and between nations.\r\nWe are awed by the challenges that continue to face\r\nhumanity and are deeply aware of our minuscule capabilities.\r\nStill, Eritrea is determined to make its own small\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 11\r\ncontribution to the betterment of human life in its own\r\ncorner of the world.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the State of\r\nEritrea for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Isaias Afwerki, President of the State of Eritrea,\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nADDRESS BY MR. RAFIC HARIRI,\r\nPRIME MINISTER OF LEBANON\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Lebanon.\r\nMr. Rafic Hariri, Prime Minister of Lebanon, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Republic of Lebanon, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Rafic Hariri, and I now invite him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. HARIRI (Lebanon) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt gives me pleasure to start out by congratulating you on\r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly of the\r\nUnited Nations at its forty-eighth session. I should also like\r\nto pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\r\nStoyan Ganev, for his able stewardship of the previous\r\nsession of the Assembly.\r\nAlso, I should like to set on record our appreciation for\r\nthe outstanding efforts of the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to attain the goals of\r\nthe United Nations and to fulfil the growing responsibilities\r\nentrusted to the world body in behalf of world peace. We\r\ndo note that the changes sweeping across the world today\r\nimpose upon the United Nations additional responsibilities\r\nwhich the President, Government and people of Lebanon\r\nview with hope and optimism. Therefore, we are all called\r\nupon to provide the United Nations with the necessary\r\nmeans for fulfilling its expanding mandates. By the same\r\ntoken, the United Nations should for its part streamline its\r\noperations in order to adapt to the demands of the future.\r\nI take this opportunity to welcome the Member States\r\nwhich have recently been admitted to the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. This is yet another indication of the\r\nuniversality of this Organization and a confirmation of the\r\ngrowing need for it.\r\nAs the current decade brings us closer to the end of\r\nanother century in the history of mankind, we now have a\r\nclearer picture of the issues and concerns that dominate the\r\nthinking of the peoples of the world. In dealing with the\r\nspectrum of these questions, we need to rely first and\r\nforemost on rational thinking. The wealth of experience\r\ndrawn from the lessons learned from the numerous conflicts\r\nthat have taken place throughout this century has taught us\r\nthat the path of peace is, in the final analysis, the optimal\r\ncourse to follow, as all other avenues have proven futile.\r\nThe era of a divided world based on blocs and polarization,\r\nwhich severely strained international relations and\r\nprecipitated crises for many decades, is now over.\r\nTherefore, the world is now ready to develop a universal\r\nvision of mankind based on a universal code of ethics and\r\nset of human rights. The United Nations Organization,\r\nwhich has long suffered from rivalries that paralysed it and\r\nplaced severe constraints on its potential, is increasingly\r\ncalled upon, in an unprecedented fashion, to engage in\r\npeace-keeping activities. Despite the fact that its current\r\noperations are somewhat different from the conventional\r\nfunctions originally envisioned for the Organization, its\r\noperations demonstrate the growing need for this world body\r\nto lend confidence and credibility to the multinational effort\r\nin dealing with challenges and conflicts in a fair and sound\r\nmanner.\r\nWe believe that understanding between States and\r\npeoples hinges upon the preservation of democracy and\r\nhuman rights. Such understanding would in turn contribute\r\nsignificantly to the elimination of regional and global\r\ndisputes, in keeping with a major principle set forth in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. Here, I would be remiss if\r\nI did not recall Lebanon’s contribution to the drafting of the\r\nCharter as well as of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, for Lebanon was a member of the Special\r\nCommittee entrusted with the drafting of both instruments.\r\nLebanon’s well-known tradition of firm commitment to\r\nthe principles of democracy, freedom and human rights, and\r\nits success in upholding those principles despite the dangers\r\nthat threatened it for many years, remains faithful to the\r\nbasic pillars upon which our pluralistic, open and creative\r\nsociety rests. Lebanon, which has withstood the trying years\r\nof its plight, is now facing its critical challenges with the\r\nvigour of renewed and consolidated national unity. It has\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nincorporated those principles into the fabric of its identity.\r\nThus, the new constitution proclaims that Lebanon is\r\n\"Arab in identity and affiliation, a founder and active\r\nmember of the League of Arab States, fully committed\r\nto its covenants; and a founding and active member of\r\nthe United Nations Organization, fully committed to its\r\nCharter and the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. The State is an embodiment of all these\r\nprinciples, in all areas and spheres wherever they apply,\r\nwithout exception.\"\r\nIn view of its singular experience, Lebanon deserves\r\nyour support and a pledge from the world community not\r\nonly to provide material assistance and help in the\r\nreconstruction of what the civil war has destroyed, but to\r\nbolster the Lebanese system. The need for the example set\r\nby this system is all the more urgent in our world today,\r\ngiven the many ethnic and religious conflicts currently\r\nraging in various regions.\r\nLebanon, with its time-honoured tradition of\r\ncoexistence, moderation and tolerance emanating from these\r\nlofty human values, can indeed be a living example to those\r\neven in advanced societies who are searching for a\r\nsuccessful formula for social harmony. This is especially\r\ntrue now that Lebanon has put its tragedy behind it and\r\nembarked on a course of accord and concord.\r\nThe great majority of the Lebanese lived through the\r\nyears of war and bore the brunt of its devastation without\r\nhaving any real belief in bellicosity or its causes.\r\nThroughout the war, some one million students continued to\r\nattend their schools and colleges as if to express, through\r\npursuit of education, their rejection of war. The same\r\nmajority continued to discharge its duties towards society\r\nand the State in many parts of the country. Even ordinary\r\ncivilian crimes did not rise noticeably during the war.\r\nAll this confirms that the Lebanese, who settled this\r\nproblem a long time ago, not only in texts and precedents,\r\nbut also in their daily routines and life-styles, are proud to\r\nbe able to present to the world, after their long suffering, a\r\ntrue example fashioned from first-hand experience of the\r\nresilience of human nature with its wealth of intellect and\r\nvivid diversity.\r\nIn our common interest we must all seek to safeguard\r\nsuch a legacy and protect it from violence. This is\r\nparticularly true in the case of the Middle East region, which\r\nhas traditionally and historically suffered from the\r\ninterference of foreign powers and the struggles of interest\r\nand conflict that transcended national frontiers, and even the\r\nentire region, to pose a threat to world peace in its entirety.\r\nGiven the magnitude and intensity of the conflicts that\r\nhave ravaged Lebanon soil, the survival of our country\r\nproves that the Lebanese nation is too strong to be\r\neliminated and that it has long-established traditions that will\r\nstand the test of time. The people of Lebanon has\r\ndemonstrated great stamina and resilience in the face of\r\noverwhelming odds.\r\nLebanon is committed to realizing its aspirations and\r\ndetermined to achieve progress within the context of the\r\nopportunities offered by the modern world. If the armed\r\nconflicts and hostilities of recent decades have drained many\r\nof our resources, our potential and our capabilities must\r\nhenceforth be channelled to face up to and overcome the\r\ncommon challenges that confront mankind everywhere.\r\nTo this end, the Lebanese Government is striving to\r\nrestore Lebanon to its special position in the community of\r\ncivilized nations. The emphasis is on achievements that will\r\nmake the Lebanese individual capable of facing the future.\r\nLebanon considers that its major loss, perhaps, has been the\r\nmigration of many of its most talented and highly skilled\r\nyoung people. One of our major concerns now is to create\r\nfavourable conditions that will attract them back. It is our\r\nhope that our human resources will be highly instrumental\r\nin expediting the reconstruction of the better society we all\r\naspire to see: a society that enjoys peace, democracy and\r\nprosperity.\r\nLebanon, whose people suffered enormous hardship\r\nduring the dark years of war, fully recognizes and\r\nappreciates the various tragedies and pains that afflict some\r\nparts of the world today. As we reaffirm our permanent\r\ncommitment to peace and to the Charter of the United\r\nNations, and to the tenets that emanate from them, we stress\r\nour adherence to and respect for an integrated system of\r\nvalues which includes human rights, freedom and dignity.\r\nIndeed, this should be the ultimate goal of every undertaking\r\nand endeavour.\r\nEarly on, the United Nations took cognizance of the\r\nsituation in Lebanon, as attested to by the many resolutions\r\nadopted by the Security Council on the Lebanese crisis.\r\nSome people may not be aware that between 1968 and 1993\r\nmore than 80 United Nations resolutions and statements on\r\nLebanon were adopted. This is a large number of\r\nresolutions in comparison with other crises. Lebanon has an\r\nimposing file indeed with both the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council. If the sheer volume of United Nations\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 13\r\nofficial records on Lebanon is compared with that of the\r\ndocuments submitted to ordinary courts of law, it will\r\nbecome clear instantly that, on the scales of international\r\njustice, the weight of evidence tips the scales in favour of\r\nLebanon. Justice and law have been, and continue to be, on\r\nthe side of Lebanon. Notwithstanding, the Lebanese have\r\nalways been deeply disappointed by the fact that political\r\ninterests have continued to outweigh justice and the rule of\r\nlaw, and led to the application of double standards regardless\r\nof the scores of resolutions that have been adopted right here\r\nin the United Nations in support of the legitimate demands\r\nof Lebanon, a country that sought effective recourse from\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nAll those United Nations resolutions have called for\r\nending violence in Lebanon and for respecting its\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, and thus have reaffirmed\r\nthe country’s political independence and national\r\nsovereignty. Therefore, we must give credit to the\r\nOrganization for its initial favourable response in regard to\r\nLebanon, especially in terms of the need to implement\r\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978) and the establishment\r\nof the United Nations peace-keeping force in southern\r\nLebanon. I avail myself of this opportunity to recognize the\r\neffective role played by the United Nations Interim Force in\r\nLebanon (UNIFIL). May I pay tribute to the many United\r\nNations personnel who have made sacrifices, including the\r\nloss of life, in the line of duty in southern Lebanon. To\r\nthose contingents and to the friendly countries that have\r\ncontributed troops, we express our deep gratitude.\r\nHowever, as we look forward to the future - having\r\ntaken firm and crucial steps towards restoring normalcy, with\r\nthe substantial and effective help of Syria in disarming the\r\nmilitias, ending the internecine fighting and restoring the\r\nauthority of the State, we feel we have the right to call upon\r\nthe United Nations at a time when its role is being redefined\r\nin consonance with current global changes, to act decisively\r\nin Lebanon. More specifically, we expect the United\r\nNations to work forcefully for the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978), and to ensure\r\nIsrael’s total withdrawal to the internationally recognized\r\nboundaries. It is not an overstatement to point out that\r\npeace in Lebanon has been, and continues to be, the sine\r\nqua non for stability in the Middle East and for the\r\nestablishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the\r\nentire region. Any peace arrangements will remain fragile\r\nand incomplete should the international community choose\r\nto tolerate the continuation of a situation that threatens\r\nLebanon with potentially explosive disputes.\r\nThe Lebanese have agreed by consensus on a new\r\nformula for national reconciliation, which was worked out in\r\n1989 at Taif in Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\r\nplayed the principal role in working out that formula, which\r\nlater became Lebanon’s constitution. Furthermore, Saudi\r\nArabia, in keeping with a long-standing tradition, together\r\nwith other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council\r\ncontinues to donate substantial assistance towards the\r\nreconstruction of Lebanon. With the same goal in mind, the\r\nLebanese Government undertook the implementation of a\r\nrehabilitation programme in all spheres of life and in an\r\nunmistakable atmosphere of international confidence.\r\nGradually, Lebanon began to restore its traditional, regional\r\nand international role. This permitted Lebanese energies to\r\nbe unleashed, and gave rise to creative initiatives for\r\nreconstructing and developing the country.\r\nIn all this, Lebanon has faced up to occupation and\r\nviolence, by adopting a stance anchored in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. Our country, which draws its strength from the\r\nsteadfastness and resilience of its people, has reaffirmed time\r\nand again its right to live in dignity and to ensure the\r\nfreedom of its territory. The Lebanese Government is\r\nheavily engaged in the reconstruction effort and the\r\nenhancement of civilian life in order to promote stability\r\nthroughout the region.\r\nIsraeli acts of aggression, which have clear objectives\r\nand purposes, have been met by the Lebanese with a high\r\nsense of responsibility, solidarity and internal unity. Our\r\nunchanging, spontaneous response is insistence on peace and\r\non securing the security and progress of our country, which\r\nhas paid dearly for having been used as an arena to settle\r\naccounts among conflicting parties.\r\nAn insistence on peace was the driving force that\r\nprompted the Lebanese to return immediately to their\r\nvillages and farms following the most recent Israeli\r\naggression. They pitched tents in front of their demolished\r\nhomes, thus demonstrating their deep attachment to the land\r\nand their loyalty to the territory and its bounties.\r\nThe true nature of the Al-Khiyam detention camp,\r\nwhere Israeli military authorities hold more than 200\r\nLebanese citizens without any legal grounds, is well known\r\nto United Nations officials and to Member States. Indeed,\r\nthe case of those detainees is common knowledge in the\r\ninternational media. Moreover, 100 other Lebanese\r\nprisoners are being held in various prisons inside Israel.\r\nDespite the repeated appeals by the Commission on Human\r\nRights and Amnesty International and the demands made by\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe Lebanese Government and human-rights societies in\r\nLebanon and the rest of the Arab world, the Israeli\r\nauthorities refuse to release them. Furthermore, for more\r\nthan eight years, Israel has denied the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross as well as family members\r\naccess to visit those prisoners.\r\nIt is high time indeed for Israel to respond to the\r\nappeals of international bodies by releasing those hostages\r\npromptly, thus putting an end to their drawn out suffering\r\nand the agony of their families. In fact, Israel is duty-bound\r\nto do so in compliance with the relevant international treaties\r\nand conventions.\r\nThe positive developments now taking place daily in\r\nLebanon are the most articulate expression of the Lebanese\r\nrefusal to permit their country once again to be a victim of\r\nthe Middle East conflict at a time when the winds of peace\r\nare starting to blow towards the region. Lebanon yearns for\r\npeace and has consistently opted for peace throughout its\r\nhistory. In fact, Lebanon can thrive only in an atmosphere\r\nof peace and stability. Indeed, its role in its own region and\r\nin the world at large cannot be performed in the midst of\r\nviolence and war. Lebanon believes that the Middle East\r\nregion, if it enjoys a just and comprehensive peace, will be\r\nin a position to contribute incalculable services to mankind.\r\nAll the peoples of the region, including the Lebanese, have\r\nenormous potential, backed by a great cultural heritage and\r\ndiverse capabilities. Energies and resources that have long\r\nbeen squandered on war could then be harnessed in the\r\nservice of social and economic development as we stand on\r\nthe threshold of the twenty-first century with all its promise\r\nof achievements to come.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, and in view of the regional and\r\ninternational developments that have made it possible to\r\ninitiate negotiations with Israel, Lebanon participated in\r\nthose negotiations two years ago despite the fact that parts\r\nof its territory have been under occupation as a result of an\r\nact of aggression committed by Israel in 1978 - and not\r\nbecause of a state of war with Israel. Lebanon’s just case\r\nfirmly rests on a series of United Nations resolutions\r\nadopted over the past 15 years, all of which demand Israel’s\r\nwithdrawal and define the necessary means and modalities\r\nrequired to achieve it.\r\nIf Israel uses the security of its northern border as a\r\npretext, we would argue that all the measures taken by\r\nIsrael, including the occupation of territory, have contributed\r\nto the disruption of security. In fact, Lebanon and the\r\ninternational community are more than ever convinced that\r\nthe only way to ensure regional security is to end the\r\noccupation of Lebanese territory and desisting from\r\ntampering with the security and safety of its population.\r\nForty-five years of unabated disputes, conflicts and\r\nwars have created certain outlooks. Changing such outlooks\r\nwill require great political courage and deep understanding\r\non the part of those who are interested in peace. Large-scale\r\ndirect support will also be needed, along with innovative\r\nthinking to shake ourselves loose from traditional frames of\r\nmind.\r\nMore than ever before, the Middle East sorely needs\r\nbrave, innovative approaches if it is to attain a firm and\r\nlasting peace. Lebanon, which is participating in the peace\r\ntalks in order to liberate its lands and lay the foundations of\r\na just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, wishes\r\nto point out the following:\r\nFirst, Lebanon demands the total withdrawal of Israel\r\nfrom all occupied Lebanese territories under Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978). The\r\nLebanese armed forces will assume full responsibility for\r\nsecurity in the southern and western regions should Israel\r\nimplement the provisions of those two resolutions.\r\nSecondly, Lebanon, which believes in and seeks peace,\r\nwould be among the first beneficiaries of a just peace as it\r\nexpands to encompass the entire region. Along with its\r\nArab brethren, Lebanon will be an active participant in\r\nmaking peace and in supporting its development and\r\nadvocating its consolidation as the underpinning of life in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nThirdly, Lebanon which has had very painful\r\nexperiences as a result of the policy of the singling out of\r\ncertain countries and imposing partial solutions, believes that\r\npeace is indivisible, especially in cases where issues are\r\nclosely interrelated, as is the case in the Middle East. We\r\nalso believe that unilateral and partial arrangements are\r\nbound to give rise to nothing but new disputes and conflicts.\r\nIn this context, I should like to affirm, on the basis of\r\nthe object-lessons learnt from our common experience, that\r\nthere can be no firm and lasting peace in the Middle East\r\nwithout Lebanon and Syria. The accord reached between\r\nIsrael and the Palestinians will remain a mere single step\r\nunless it is quickly complemented by substantive solutions\r\non the other Arab tracks. Lebanon, which is extremely\r\nlimited in the size of its territory, has a delicate population\r\ncomposition and scant economic resources, cannot provide\r\na solution for Palestinians who have been uprooted from\r\ntheir land. The responsibility for returning the Palestinians\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 15\r\nto their homeland and for finding a satisfactory solution to\r\ntheir status remains within the competence of the\r\ninternational community. If we really wish to put an end\r\nonce for all to the chapters of pain and anguish in the\r\nMiddle East, then the cause of the Palestinians should be\r\naddressed in such a manner that may ensure for them a\r\ndecent life commensurate with their legitimate aspirations\r\nand the aspirations of all our countries after human rights.\r\nFourthly, in order to achieve peace, Lebanon is willing\r\nto cooperate fully with the two co-sponsors of the peace\r\nconference, particularly the United States of America, to\r\nreach a comprehensive and just solution that would\r\nsafeguard the right of all parties to permanent peace, and put\r\nan end once and for all to conflicts in the region. Towards\r\nthat end, Lebanon stands ready to assume its due share of\r\nthe responsibility.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Lebanon for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Rafic Hariri, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nLebanon, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nMr. ANDREATTA (Italy): I would like to express our\r\nwarmest congratulations to Guyana and to you personally,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nI am also pleased that in the past year the United\r\nNations family has grown to include the Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,\r\nAndorra, Monaco and Eritrea. We wish to extend a special\r\nwelcome to the last two in view of our long-standing historic\r\nand human ties.\r\nItaly, deeply committed to European political and\r\neconomic unity, shares the views expressed by the Belgian\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, who is the current Chairman of\r\nthe European Council.\r\nWe are not simply voicing conventional wisdom if we\r\nstress the depth of the transformations that define the times\r\nin which we live. Every day brings forth new proof that the\r\nend of the cold war has brought us to a watershed. We must\r\ncarefully decipher the lessons and courageously shoulder the\r\nnew tasks with which this moment has presented us.\r\nAs the Secretary-General said in Milan, international\r\nlaw is the main instrument at our disposal; it is not merely\r\na regulatory instrument but the very language of the relations\r\nbetween States. But the social pressures we are now facing\r\nare profoundly new, generating changes that international\r\nlaw must begin to reflect as it translates new needs into new\r\ninstitutions.\r\nIf today we believe we can govern this transformation,\r\nand if we refuse to yield to the disorderly growth of a new\r\ninternational order, we have first and foremost the renewed\r\nvitality and prominence of the United Nations to thank.\r\nThe United Nations has evolved on the foundation of\r\npractices that are solidly inscribed in the Charter, while\r\ndiscovering new ways to pursue its aims. Take\r\npeace-keeping, a practice from the United Nations earliest\r\ndays that has recently acquired a special role. Today peace\r\nis more likely to be threatened by the explosion of internal\r\nconflicts (though at times with transnational components)\r\nthan by acts of open aggression across international borders.\r\nPeace-keeping, peace-enforcement, and humanitarian relief\r\nmissions all take place in the midst of conflicts with\r\ncomplex political causes, and tangled ethnic and national\r\nroots. In such an environment, the traditional juxtaposition\r\nof diplomacy and military action no longer corresponds to\r\nthe reality of the present, and a broad initial mandate is not\r\nsufficient concretely to define operations in the field.\r\nThe unity of military command is an unquestionable\r\nprinciple, without which no operation can succeed.\r\nHowever, the political management of an operation cannot\r\nbe confined strictly to military options, especially when the\r\nreal issue is not the legitimacy of the use of force (which\r\nmay be clearly authorized by the Security Council’s\r\nmandate), but its advisability and timing in view of the\r\npolitical objectives. I would add that in situations involving\r\ncrowds of civilians, we must consider making it our policy\r\nalways to give pride of place to the use of non-lethal\r\nanti-riot equipment. This is not only an Italian concern.\r\nSpokesmen for other countries have also stressed that\r\ncountries contributing troops to United Nations\r\npeace-keeping missions need mechanisms that would exempt\r\ntheir troops from passively abiding by orders that may be\r\nillegal, inconsistent, or in contradiction with the aims of the\r\noperation.\r\nThe United Nations peace-keeping practices reveal an\r\nawareness of the need for adequate prior consultation of\r\ntroop-contributing countries. To this end, while Article 29\r\nof the Charter provides a general guideline for the\r\nestablishment of bodies subsidiary to the Security Council,\r\nArticle 44 could provide a more fitting solution to the\r\nproblem. It provides for the Security Council to establish\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nconsultative procedures with non-members of the Security\r\nCouncil that have been requested to contribute troops to\r\npeace-keeping and security operations. Today, even in the\r\nabsence of formal agreements such as those provided for by\r\nArticle 43, I believe we should extend Article 44, by\r\nanalogy, to operations conducted under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter.\r\nIn his \"An Agenda for Peace\", the Secretary-General\r\ndefined peace-building as laying the necessary political and\r\nsocio-economic foundations for a lasting peace after the\r\nphase of open conflict has ended. The reconstruction - or\r\nthe establishment - of legal and economic institutions in\r\ncritical areas and countries represents the main prerequisite\r\nof an enduring peace.\r\nThese premises form the basis of what Italy means to\r\npropose in order to move beyond the current situation in\r\nSomalia - a situation characterized somewhat by giving pride\r\nof place to the military aspect of the United Nations\r\nOperation in Somalia (UNOSOM) and by the standstill in\r\nthe political process. We believe that it is essential that the\r\nUnited Nations step up its political efforts at peacemaking by\r\nappointing a personality of great international prestige to\r\nrenew the political and diplomatic initiative with all the\r\nSomali factions. At the same time, the mechanisms of the\r\nAddis Ababa Conference should be reactivated in such a\r\nway as to increase the involvement of the African nations\r\nand their institutions in the normalization of Somalia. But\r\nthe predominantly political nature of our operation to restore\r\nhope in Somalia must also be translated into the progressive\r\nreconstruction of Somalia’s basic economic and social\r\nstructures and the reorganization of a government and its\r\nadministrative structures. This requires broad development\r\nprogrammes, to which Italy’s commitment has remained\r\nunswerving even in the most difficult moments.\r\nMrs. Fritsche (Liechtenstein), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nItaly welcomes the renewed central role of the United\r\nNations, and at the same time supports a reform of its\r\ninstitutional mechanisms.\r\nLet us first consider the possibility of a change in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council. As Italy emphasized\r\nto the Secretary-General last June, since the Security Council\r\nis moving towards a future of greater burdens and\r\nresponsibilities, its representativeness and effectiveness must\r\ndevelop in parallel. What we suggest is that, in addition to\r\nthe permanent members with veto power and the\r\nnon-permanent members, a third category be established. It\r\nwould be made up of countries able to make a special\r\ncontribution to achieving the objectives of the United\r\nNations. What matters is not drawing up controversial lists,\r\nbut identifying objective criteria for selection, based on\r\neconomic factors, human resources, culture, and mass\r\ncommunications. These countries would rotate two at a\r\ntime, thereby becoming semi-permanent members of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe must all recognize the renewed central role of the\r\nUnited Nations in international relations, but avoid\r\ninterpreting this role in exclusive terms.\r\nThe regional dimension of multilateralism, which is\r\ndescribed in Chapter VIII of the Charter, has today a great\r\nrole. Take the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE), which has been explicitly defined as a\r\nregional institution on the basis of the United Nations\r\nCharter. Italy is about to assume the chairmanship of the\r\nCSCE. We believe that it is being called on to play an\r\nincreasing role, mainly in preventive diplomacy but also in\r\npeace-keeping and in fostering negotiated settlements. In\r\nthis regional framework, we would welcome more stringent\r\nregulations on arms transfers that build on the present United\r\nNations provisions.\r\nIf it is true that without peace there can be neither\r\ndevelopment nor satisfaction of social needs, it is also true\r\nthat conflict is fed everywhere not only by the urge to\r\nsubjugate the adversary violently but also by the existence of\r\nsocial injustice, imbalance and poverty.\r\nThe first and basic injustice is the violation of human\r\nrights. When the international community defends human\r\nrights, it is pursuing absolute and autonomous values that\r\nmust be protected. At the same time, it is eradicating many\r\nof the causes of violence between groups and nations.\r\nWe hope that an agreement between the groups will\r\nfinally make it possible to end the fighting in Bosnia.\r\nHowever, as the international community prepares to support\r\nthe implementation of an agreement, we must not forget the\r\nwar crimes and the crimes against humanity committed\r\nduring this tragic conflict. Thus, we applaud the\r\nestablishment of the International Tribunal and hope that -\r\nimpartial and free from political influences - it will begin its\r\nwork at the earliest possible date. Where appropriate, the\r\nTribunal should hand down tough sentences, although I take\r\nexception to the death sentence, which Italy firmly opposes\r\non the basis of its time- honoured juridical traditions.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 17\r\nI wonder if the international community could not\r\nsummon the same determination to establish an international\r\ncriminal court to prosecute the most serious human rights\r\nviolations.\r\nItaly is convinced that human rights prosper in systems\r\nbased on democracy and an open-market economy. That is\r\nwhy we firmly support Governments that are committed to\r\nsuch goals and work courageously through hardships and\r\ntemporary crises.\r\nAn issue of great contemporary relevance is the\r\nprotection of minorities - which cannot be separated from\r\nthe protection of individuals, for the two issues are based on\r\nthe same hopes, the same principles of freedom and the\r\nsame respect for cultural, religious and philosophical\r\ndifferences. Too often, the territorial integrity of the State\r\nhas been contrasted with the rights of minorities. Instead,\r\nwe must demonstrate that in a democracy, a democracy that\r\nleaves room for direct participation and for true pluralism of\r\nidentity and choice, it is possible to balance these two\r\nequally worthy values. We must demonstrate that there is\r\nno contradiction between the protection of minorities and the\r\nstability of borders. On the contrary, as the experience of\r\nmy country shows, they can reinforce each other.\r\nThe principles, institutions and rights that make peace\r\nmore solid are a primary consideration. But we must never\r\nunderestimate the often-decisive role played by weapons.\r\nThe accumulation and development of weapons endangers\r\nstability since the perception of a threat triggers actions that\r\nare harmful for peace and economically ruinous.\r\nThat is why disarmament and non-proliferation, even in\r\nthe post-cold-war era, must remain one of our main\r\nobjectives and why we highly value the message delivered\r\nfrom this podium by the President of the United States.\r\nWe need to complete past disarmament initiatives that\r\nwe have agreed to and begun, and both confirm and expand\r\nexisting tools. We strongly support the early ratification of\r\nthe Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II). The\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty must be strictly observed, which is\r\nwhy North Korea’s unclear attitude towards that Treaty is a\r\nmatter of such great concern. That Treaty must also be\r\nstrengthened and made universal. In 1995, we should all\r\njoin together to renew the Treaty unconditionally and for an\r\nindefinite period.\r\nToday we are witnessing the emergence of a collective\r\nconsciousness, the expansion of a shared system of values,\r\nan international citizenship based on common, objective\r\ninterests and the spread of more uniform lifestyles. An\r\nItalian philosopher, Giambattista Vico, wrote:\r\n\"Ultimately, once the cities got to know each other,\r\nhaving shared dealings in war, alliances and trade, they\r\ncame, to an unprecedented extent, to the recognition of\r\nnatural civic rights as a natural right of all peoples, that\r\nis of all united nations - as if the world were one large\r\ncity - which is the law of humankind.\"\r\nThat was written in the early eighteenth century.\r\nFaced with a world beset by multiple conflicts, in\r\nwhich individual nations or groups often pursue their\r\ninterests through the use of force, it would be intellectually\r\ndishonest and morally reprehensible to adopt attitudes of\r\nresignation or fatalism. Violence is no more natural than\r\npeaceful coexistence and collaboration between peoples and\r\ngroups. Acting against violence and for coexistence is\r\ntherefore not only morally desirable, but actually practicable.\r\nOne such possibility has been eloquently demonstrated\r\nin recent days by the hopeful development of a peaceful\r\nfuture in the Middle East thanks to the courage of the\r\nIsraelis, the Palestinians and the Arab countries. As a\r\nMediterranean country with a long tradition of active\r\ninvolvement in the cause of stability and peace in the area,\r\nItaly is ready to contribute further to help the entire region\r\ntake the first steps on a long and complex journey toward\r\npeace and cooperation, with borders permanently defined in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolutions. The same\r\npossibility is confirmed by the promising steps being taken\r\ntowards democracy and coexistence in South Africa.\r\nThe awareness of the possibility and the moral duty to\r\nact must also inspire our attitude towards the economic and\r\nsocial problems that dehumanize the lives of millions of\r\npeople all over the world. I am referring to development\r\npolicies, which should be conducted in a spirit of solidarity\r\nand on the basis of multilateral coordination. Such\r\ncoordination must also be extended to bilateral initiatives,\r\nwhile we also need closer cooperation between agencies.\r\nThat approach has already produced successful results in\r\nMozambique and Eritrea, and even in war-torn Somalia. It\r\nmust now be applied to endorse the peace process in the\r\nMiddle East. The donors’ conference about to open in\r\nWashington will provide an important occasion to translate\r\nour political support into action.\r\nWe know the limits of our actions, and we cannot allow\r\nourselves to be swayed by the temptations of noble but\r\nabstract Utopias. It is our responsibility to draw up\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nprinciples and instruments that are valid for the times in\r\nwhich we live and that can help us to manage and to\r\ntransform in a more rational and humane way the reality that\r\nsurrounds us.\r\nEach country must promote this action on its own or\r\nthrough alliances or other groups. But it is ultimately here,\r\nin the framework of this Organization and in view of its\r\nuniversal aims and membership, that each country will have\r\nto contribute to the solution of these problems. To do this,\r\nwe must not limit ourselves to declaring principles but,\r\nrather, on the basis of those principles we must be willing to\r\nhand the United Nations the tools it needs. The international\r\ncommunity - in other words, we as Member States - is\r\ngiving the United Nations greater and greater responsibilities.\r\nBut the responsibilities of the United Nations are our\r\nresponsibilities. The problems of the United Nations are our\r\nproblems.\r\nMr. JESZENSZKY (Hungary): Allow me to express\r\nmy warmest congratulations to Ambassador Insanally, on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session. I should also like to welcome into our midst\r\nAndorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Monaco and Slovakia, whose recent\r\nadmissions have brought the United Nations even closer to\r\nbecoming truly universal.\r\nDuring the last year, the international community\r\ncontinued to face extremely grave challenges. This period\r\nhas seen, along with certain positive achievements, more\r\nalarming failures and disappointments. The questions to\r\nwhich we have to respond take us back once again to the\r\nbasic problem of multilateralism, that is to say, to defining\r\nin our complex world the values that can ensure a cohesion\r\nwhich is necessary for our common will to be translated into\r\njoint action.\r\nThe fall of communist dictatorships in Central and\r\nEastern Europe and the end of super-Power confrontation\r\nhave brought about an international political climate in\r\nwhich new approaches can be found in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and the resolution of global\r\nproblems. They are based on greater opportunities for closer\r\ninteraction and the participation of each and every United\r\nNations Member State in managing and influencing the\r\ncourse of events. These opportunities and the ability of the\r\ninternational community to turn them into tangible results are\r\nmanifest in the conflict-resolution processes in Central\r\nAmerica and South-East Asia, in the resolute reversal of\r\nbrutal aggression in the Gulf, in the fundamental\r\ntransformation we are witnessing in South Africa and in the\r\nhistoric agreement in the Middle East. These evolutions\r\nclearly demonstrate that with political courage,\r\nfar-sightedness and readiness for compromise, even the most\r\nintractable problems can be untangled and resolved. They\r\nshow us an example that ought to be emulated in all regions\r\nof the world.\r\nThe convulsions of the new era of world history are\r\nstrongly felt in a country like Hungary which, as it has so\r\noften in its history, finds itself again close to conflict-ridden\r\nareas. Despite the difficulties that inevitably accompany the\r\nhistoric transition processes of the region, the Hungarian\r\nGovernment, ever since it took office in 1990, has been\r\nstriving consistently and successfully to maintain the\r\ncountry’s internal stability and to ensure that it remains a\r\nmainstay of stability in our troubled region. Stability should\r\nbe omnipresent and universal, and we have to find the\r\nappropriate ways and means to achieve it.\r\nAs regards the old continent, Hungary wants to see\r\ndemocracy, prosperity, security and the institutions, such as\r\nthe Council of Europe, the European Community and the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that lie at its\r\nfoundation, gradually expand eastward.\r\nFor some time now the world has been living in the\r\nshadow of events that ominously remind us of the darkest\r\nperiods in the history of mankind. The conflict in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia has been raging for more than two years.\r\nBut most regrettably, not even the worst cases of disregard\r\nfor the norms of international law and the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter, not even the gravest crimes against\r\nhumanity and the most brutal mass violations of fundamental\r\nhuman and minority rights, have proven to be sufficient to\r\npersuade the world, when there was still time, to counter\r\naggression promptly and effectively, to prevent the\r\nacquisition of territory by use of force and to take a firm\r\nstand against the abhorrent policy of \"ethnic cleansing\".\r\nThe end result of such policies of passivity,\r\nappeasement and complacency, of the striking lack of an\r\nability to learn from past experiences and of the absence of\r\nthe necessary political will to act, is well documented right\r\nhere, in this building, in a shocking and soul-stirring photo\r\nexhibition about the horrors of war in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nIt brings home a painful awareness of the practical\r\nconsequences of unbridled extreme nationalism and the\r\ncompelling message not to relax and relent in our national,\r\nregional and international efforts to uphold in an\r\nuncompromising manner the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 19\r\nThe renewal of Central and Eastern Europe and the\r\neconomic and social processes there have thrown to the\r\nsurface tendencies of political and ethnic fundamentalism\r\nwhich, having been elevated to the level of official State\r\npolicy, have unleashed or could lead to conflicts threatening\r\nthe security of the whole of Europe. In our interdependent\r\nworld, every nation on Earth, irrespective of where it is\r\nsituated, should realize the danger of this venomous\r\ncontagion if it were allowed to spread across our planet.\r\nThe people and the Government of Hungary continue\r\nto follow the developments of the crisis in the former\r\nYugoslavia with utmost concern. As a country immediately\r\nadjacent to the crisis area, Hungary has sought to avoid\r\nbeing dragged into this conflict, while continuing at the same\r\ntime to voice its principled position on the crisis and abiding\r\nby the relevant decisions of the international community.\r\nOne has to reckon with the fact that this crisis is not\r\nlimited to the war-torn areas of Bosnia and Croatia. It\r\nfesters in Serbia proper, where there is growing pressure on\r\nthe different ethnic communities inhabiting the country,\r\nincluding the Hungarian community in Vojvodina. In this\r\nformerly autonomous province, the successive waves of\r\nintimidation and discrimination have already significantly\r\nreduced both the size and the proportion of the Hungarian\r\nminority. There continues to be a constant threat of a\r\nfurther massive influx of refugees into Hungary, I am afraid.\r\nIn the conditions prevailing in Serbia and Montenegro, just\r\nas in other parts of the former Yugoslavia, it is of utmost\r\nimportance to seek adequate international protection for these\r\nethnic communities and national minorities. Indeed, one of\r\nthe key issues in settling the crisis is to ensure their rights\r\nwithout any discrimination, whether they have majority or\r\nminority status, with the same norms and standards applying\r\nto each and every one of them.\r\nBecause of its geographical situation, Hungary finds\r\nitself confronted with special economic problems arising\r\nfrom the implementation of sanctions imposed by the\r\nSecurity Council against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\n(Serbia and Montenegro). Our economic and financial losses\r\ndirectly attributable to the effects of implementing the\r\nsanctions are constantly growing, and have now reached $1\r\nbillion. We highly appreciate the steps taken so far by the\r\nSecurity Council vis-à-vis those countries that have suffered\r\neconomic losses and have made use of their right to consult\r\nthe Security Council under Article 50 of the Charter. We\r\ntrust that the international organizations and institutions\r\nconcerned will find early solutions to help alleviate those\r\npressing problems. It is clear from the experience gained in\r\nconnection with the various sanctions regimes in place that\r\nattention from the international community commensurate\r\nwith the scale of the problems caused to third countries is\r\nrequired in order to examine how best we can establish an\r\neffective mechanism for the implementation of Article 50.\r\nWithout such a mechanism, the burden placed on an\r\never-growing number of countries fulfilling their\r\ninternational obligations will remain disproportionately and\r\nunjustly heavy.\r\nIn this connection, it is totally unacceptable to take\r\nretaliatory measures in response to actions by any State in\r\nfulfilment of its obligations under the Charter. Therefore,\r\nillegal measures such as attempts to block free and safe\r\nnavigation on the Danube river, which is an international\r\nwaterway vital for many countries of Europe, warrant\r\ninternational action, and the States concerned rightly expect\r\nthe international organizations to provide effective assistance\r\nin this matter.\r\nIn the light of recent bitter experiences, we have\r\nbecome more acutely aware that the world cannot be made\r\na safer place unless there are international organizations able\r\nand willing to take resolute and timely action. Multilateral\r\ndiplomacy must be at its best if it is to offer remedies where\r\nother possibilities for preventing or settling conflicts have\r\nbeen exhausted. We consider it especially important that the\r\nvarious tools of preventive diplomacy and crisis management\r\nshould be constantly at the disposal of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nHungary is highly interested in the ongoing work aimed\r\nat a comprehensive review and enhancement of the United\r\nNations peace-keeping, peacemaking and peace- building\r\nactivities. Many substantive proposals have been made and\r\nuseful observations put forward in this regard. We hope that\r\nthey will assist in our endeavours to carry out genuine and\r\npurpose-oriented reform measures in the world Organization.\r\nWe expect that the present session of the General Assembly\r\nwill move us ahead in the debate on how to bring certain\r\nprovisions of the Charter into line with the changing realities\r\nof our world. Conditions seem ripe today for giving most\r\nserious consideration to questions relating to the review of\r\nthe Charter. The fundamental aim of such a review is to\r\nmake the United Nations function better. At the same time,\r\nit should in no way undermine the effectiveness of the\r\ndecision-making processes at the United Nations. In this\r\ncontext, Hungary fully understands the pressing financial\r\nsituation of the world Organization and, as its contribution\r\nto redressing this state of affairs, has, as of this year,\r\neliminated all its arrears to the regular budget.\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn our view, there are, inter alia, two particular areas\r\nwhere a review of the provisions of the Charter is needed.\r\nFirst, there is a long-overdue need for a review of those\r\nCharter provisions that imply a distinction between United\r\nNations Member States on the basis of their status of\r\nsignatory or enemy State. On the eve of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the birth of the United Nations, the\r\nelimination of this obsolete distinction would be more than\r\na gesture towards a number of countries that have, over the\r\nyears, fully proved their commitment to the purposes and\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter. Secondly, the role\r\nplayed in today’s world politics by some States and their\r\ncontribution to the realization of the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter justify their more intimate involvement in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We are\r\naware that the issue of the enlargement of the permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council will be the subject of\r\nfurther discussions. However, we believe that two countries\r\n- Germany and Japan - already qualify to play the enhanced\r\nrole that would stem from permanent membership in the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMy Government continues to believe that the United\r\nNations provides a most fitting framework for translating\r\ninto reality our global responsibility for the international\r\nprotection of human rights. It is our deep conviction that the\r\nSecurity Council should pay appropriate attention, and act\r\nresolutely and promptly, as part of its preventive actions, to\r\nmass infringements of human and minority rights, since they\r\nconstitute threats to regional and international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe should pursue an effective integration of human\r\nrights elements into the workings of the whole United\r\nNations system. Hungary supports the early establishment\r\nof a post of high commissioner for human rights. An\r\nappropriate mandate from this session of the General\r\nAssembly could ensure, through this new institution, an\r\nadequate presence for human rights elements, particularly in\r\nthe various fields of early warning, conflict management,\r\npeace-keeping and peace-making, electoral assistance and\r\npost-conflict peace-building. The high commissioner could\r\nmake the human rights activities of the United Nations more\r\ntransparent to world public opinion. We intend to lend our\r\nfull support to a mandate for the high commissioner that\r\nwould also cover the protection and promotion of minority\r\nrights. In our view, the high commissioner could also play\r\na major role in raising public awareness of the positive\r\nmodels of multinational coexistence and minority protection\r\nsystems that are functioning well in various democratic\r\ncountries of the world. Here I can refer to the previous\r\nspeaker, whose country, I believe, is a good example of this.\r\nWe believe that this task is of major importance and has\r\nnever been higher on the agenda than it is today. The\r\napplication or adaptation of these successful solutions to the\r\nspecific circumstances prevailing in other parts of the world\r\ncould greatly contribute to a more satisfactory human rights\r\nsituation in our world at the end of this turbulent century.\r\nI have obviously not exhausted all the problems\r\nbesetting the world. Our Governments today have an\r\nenormous responsibility to find answers to the new\r\nchallenges. If we fail to act now, we risk losing all the\r\nachievements won with the ending of the cold war.\r\nMr. ASAMOAH (Ghana): It is with pleasure that, on\r\nbehalf of the Ghana delegation, I convey to Mr. Insanally of\r\nGuyana our congratulations on his election, by acclamation,\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession. He assumes this high office at a momentous time\r\nin the history of mankind, as we endeavour to establish a\r\nnew world order based on freedom and justice. The skills\r\nand experience that he brings to his office assure us of\r\nsuccess during his tenure. The cordial relations that happily\r\nexist between the President’s country and mine increase our\r\nsatisfaction, hopes and expectations. We pledge to him and\r\nto the Bureau our full cooperation and support.\r\nLet me place on record also our appreciation of the\r\neffective leadership that the President’s predecessor,\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, gave to our Organization\r\nduring his stewardship. His ability to navigate the General\r\nAssembly through the turbulence of a contradictory context\r\nin international relations was admirable.\r\nOnce again, the Secretary-General has shown, through\r\na display of his remarkable skills as a thinker, an\r\nadministrator and an accomplished diplomat, that he is on\r\ntop of his job. The credit is no doubt shared by the staff,\r\nwhose dedication and commitment have been maintained.\r\nThe universality of the General Assembly, which makes\r\nit the most representative organ of the Organization, has\r\nagain been reaffirmed with the admission of five new\r\nMember States since August 1992. We take this opportunity\r\nto welcome them and to extend to them the cooperation of\r\nthe Ghana delegation.\r\nThe search for enduring peace is still the greatest\r\nchallenge of the Organization, in spite of the end of the cold\r\nwar. The collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics and the accession to independence of its\r\nconstituent parts, the freedom and independence of the\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 21\r\ncountries of Eastern Europe, German reunification, and the\r\ncold-war relics of trouble spots have brought to the fore\r\n\"Simmering disputes, violent conflicts, aggression and\r\nforeign occupation, interference in the internal affairs of\r\nStates, policies of hegemony and domination, ethnic\r\nstrife, religious intolerance, new forms of racism and\r\nnarrowly conceived nationalism\", (A/47/675, annex,\r\npara. 3)\r\nas the Jakarta Message of 1992 of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement so aptly stated.\r\nAt the same time, our world is faced with an economic\r\nand a social situation similar to that which preceded the two\r\nworld wars. All these developments, aggravated by global\r\nrecession, threaten to undermine the purposes of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe must continue to pursue the goal of total\r\ndisarmament. We should like the proposed United Nations\r\nRegister of Conventional Arms to include nations’\r\nproduction of arms and all other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nThe goal of complete and total disarmament would\r\nobviously be easier to pursue in an environment of peace\r\nbased on mutual confidence. It is in this context that we\r\nwelcome the efforts of the United Nations to shoulder the\r\nincreasing burden of peace-keeping and peacemaking. In\r\nCambodia, Mozambique, Angola, South Africa, the former\r\nYugoslavia, Somalia, the Middle East, Cyprus, and\r\nelsewhere, the efforts of the United Nations have served as\r\na positive check on the threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. There are, however, lessons to be drawn for\r\ncurrent and future operations. The holding of elections in\r\nAngola and in Cambodia without the fulfilment of certain\r\nconditions, such as the disarming and cantonment of troops,\r\nwas tactically unhelpful, in spite of the circumstances that\r\nled to the elections - a mistake which, thankfully, the United\r\nNations does not intend to repeat in Mozambique. We\r\nshould also remind ourselves that peacemaking may be a\r\nslow and painful process. The need to retain the confidence\r\nof all parties and their support for, and participation in, the\r\nprocess is fundamental and crucial to the success of such\r\noperations.\r\nWe are disappointed at the instability that continues to\r\nengulf the former Yugoslavia. Whilst we still regret the\r\ninitial reaction of the international community - in particular,\r\nthe regional institutions - to developments there, we wish to\r\nreiterate that unrestrained nationalism that seeks justification\r\nin the much-cherished principle of self- determination is\r\nunacceptable. Furthermore, the expression of such\r\nnationalism in \"ethnic cleansing\" is as barbaric and revolting\r\nas it is reprehensible and totally at variance with civilized\r\nbehaviour. The readiness of the United Nations to act\r\ndecisively in Somalia contrasts sharply with the timidity and\r\nhesitation that have marked our presence in the former\r\nYugoslavia and threaten to erode the credibility of the\r\nOrganization. It is for these reasons that we welcome\r\nSecurity Council resolution 859 (1993), in which the\r\nCouncil, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter, calls for\r\nthe immediate cease-fire and cessation of hostilities\r\nthroughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that are\r\nessential if a just and equitable political solution to the\r\nconflict is to be achieved through peaceful negotiations. We\r\nexpect the Security Council to monitor the implementation\r\nof the resolution.\r\nMy Government warmly welcomes the historic\r\nagreements on limited autonomy for Palestine and on mutual\r\nrecognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization. These accords are a tribute to the courage,\r\nforesight, determination and outstanding statesmanship of\r\nC h a i r m a n Y a s s e r A r a f a t a n d o f P r i m e\r\nMinister Yitzhak Rabin. They usher in the beginning of the\r\nend of decades of war, mistrust, violence, destruction and\r\nwanton killing and suffering that the Arab-lsraeli conflict has\r\nbrought to the people of the Middle East. They lay a solid\r\nfoundation for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the\r\nMiddle East. We therefore urge the entire international\r\ncommunity to support them.\r\nFrom the new dawn of relations in the Middle East\r\nemerges a powerful, compelling and inspiring truth - that\r\nthere is no conflict that is not capable of solution. That is\r\nwhy we consider that the \"no war, no peace\" situation in\r\nCyprus should not be permitted to lure this Organization into\r\ncomplacency. The search for a settlement should be\r\naccelerated. To this end, the recent decision to maintain the\r\nUnited Nations presence in Cyprus should encourage all the\r\nparties involved.\r\nThe situation in Sudan, equally, cries out for a peaceful\r\nsolution and for greater United Nations involvement as a\r\ncontribution to the search for an enduring settlement to an\r\nessentially political problem that has brought such suffering\r\nto the people and has created an unbearable refugee problem\r\nfor neighbouring States.\r\nOur Organization has recorded laudable success in its\r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)\r\non the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nColonial Countries and Peoples. The independence of\r\nNamibia is the latest of the success stories of decolonization.\r\nHowever, the Territories and peoples that remain under\r\ncolonial rule demand our active and sustained attention and\r\nrender premature any conclusion that the decolonization\r\nprocess has been completed.\r\nWe welcome the progress that has been made in the\r\nnegotiations in South Africa. However, the international\r\ncommunity needs to remind itself that apartheid is far from\r\nbeing completely eradicated. The process of democratization\r\nin that country must be completed so that all its citizens may\r\nbe enabled to exercise their voting rights. The world\r\ncommunity has a responsibility to maintain its vigilance\r\nregarding South Africa until the election on 27 April 1994,\r\nwhich will put in place an acceptable constitutional\r\nprogramme for a transitional Government based, for the first\r\ntime in the history of that country, on universal adult\r\nsuffrage.\r\nOf equal concern is the impasse over Western Sahara.\r\nThe United Nations peace plan must be allowed to work,\r\nand the timetable set for the holding of elections must be\r\nrespected by all. In the light of the call for a more prudent\r\nuse of the resources available to the United Nations, it is\r\nimperative that the task of the United Nations Mission for\r\nthe Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) be\r\ncompleted rapidly, to the full satisfaction of all concerned,\r\nparticularly the Sahraoui people.\r\nThe new impetus for peacemaking and peace-keeping\r\nrepresents a major advance in our collective engagement in\r\nthe task of seeking and creating a peaceful and safe world.\r\nIn this Assembly it has been suggested that the United\r\nNations should limit its commitments, that it should not take\r\non every conflict. But which conflicts must it address, and\r\nwhich ones should it decline to get involved in? That is the\r\ncrucial question. The unity of the purposes of the Charter\r\nand the universality of our Organization compel us to\r\nrecognize that a threat to peace anywhere is a threat to peace\r\neverywhere.\r\nBut even if the suggestions have merit, either on the\r\ngrounds of lack of funds, constraints in logistics or the\r\nUnited Nations inability to heal all the world’s wounds, my\r\ndelegation wants to stress the need for the United Nations to\r\nsee all the peace-keeping assignments it is engaged in\r\nthrough to their logical conclusion. The United Nations\r\ncannot, at this juncture, turn its back on South Africa,\r\nLiberia, Rwanda, Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, Somalia or\r\nthe former Yugoslavia. It would be a sad day indeed if all\r\nthese laudable initiatives were abandoned on the grounds of\r\nwell-reasoned arguments pleading lack of funds or of the\r\nwill to help these nations enjoy the peace that has eluded\r\nthem for years.\r\nIn recognition of the fact that the United Nations cannot\r\nundertake too many initiatives, it should devise mechanisms\r\nfor shoring up regional efforts at conflict resolution, such as\r\nin Liberia. We also wish to stress that the internal parties to\r\nthe various conflicts which the United Nations is striving so\r\nhard to resolve have a moral responsibility to play their part\r\nin accelerating the process towards peace. Human decency\r\nand the sanctity of human life impose this duty on them. In\r\nthis respect, we must encourage the Inkatha Freedom Party\r\nand other right-wing groups to join the process of\r\nnegotiations in South Africa, and we should condemn in no\r\nuncertain terms the treachery of UNITA and the attitude of\r\nsome of the Somali warlords.\r\nWhatever mistakes the United Nations Operation in\r\nSomalia (UNOSOM) may have made, it is grotesque for any\r\nSomali leader to seek to be a hero by engaging the United\r\nNations in combat. Such a show of ingratitude may have\r\nlong-term damaging consequences in terms of the\r\nwillingness of Member States to undertake humanitarian\r\nmissions. And what would be the consequences for the\r\nSomali people should the United Nations decide to abort\r\nUNOSOM? Any leader who has the interest of his people at\r\nheart needs to reflect on that.\r\nIt is noteworthy that many of the conflicts plaguing us\r\nare in the developing countries. We hope the call for\r\nlimiting the peace-keeping role of the United Nations is not\r\nan attempt to shirk the burden of engaging in solving the\r\npolitical problems in these countries in the same way as the\r\nfundamental economic concerns of these countries have been\r\nmarginalized.\r\nAs we concern ourselves with the resolution of these\r\nsometimes malignant conflicts, let us not forget to address\r\nthe fundamental factors that generate many of them. We\r\nknow that a great proportion of these problems can be traced\r\nto economic deprivation and underdevelopment. My\r\ndelegation has stressed time and again in this Assembly and\r\nelsewhere that underdevelopment and conflicts have a link.\r\nIt is often the poorest countries or countries where economic\r\ndecline has been steep that relapse into savage violence. We\r\nhave also said that the source of the condition of\r\nunderdevelopment can be largely traced to a global economic\r\nsystem that has been inimical to the interests of developing\r\nand poor countries.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 23\r\nIt is time the United Nations, in its effort to construct\r\npeace and keep the peace, addressed some of the\r\nfundamental economic issues that hamper all efforts to\r\neradicate global poverty. In this connection, the perennial\r\nproblems that plague the economies of the South must now\r\nbe fully tackled as part of the energetic search for world\r\npeace. We have said in almost all United Nations forums,\r\nincluding the Assembly, that the debt burden cripples our\r\neconomies. We have spoken regularly about the\r\nunacceptable levels of resource flow from the poor nations\r\nto the rich. We have drawn regular attention to the unequal\r\nterms of trade, protectionist barriers and a disastrous global\r\npricing system that does not pay us adequately for the fruits\r\nof our labour, whether we produce coffee, cocoa or copper.\r\nIt is time the United Nations placed development and\r\nthe crucial need for restructuring the world economy on its\r\npriority list side-by-side with, if not above, its peace-keeping\r\nand peacemaking agenda. The United Nations must defend\r\neach nation’s right to earn its way by being an equal\r\nparticipant in the global market place. Many of us have\r\nundertaken structural adjustments. Yet the returns of the\r\ngreat sacrifices we have made remain low. So many of us\r\ncannot provide adequate social services in the form of\r\nschools, clinics or clean water for our people. In many\r\ninstances, bowing to the conditions set for the loans we\r\ncontract to expand our export base, we have to lay off\r\nworkers and thus consign thousands or even millions of\r\nfamilies to indigence as the small pay check that puts a meal\r\non the table, buys medicine when the child is sick, or\r\nprovides the uniform for the new school-goer in the family,\r\nis no longer forthcoming.\r\nThe United Nations has been advised, correctly in our\r\nview, to run efficient peace-keeping operations, to refurbish\r\nitself administratively and to upgrade its skills in all the\r\nspheres of its endeavours. We wish to add that the United\r\nNations must now also place upon its active agenda the\r\nquestion of development and tackle it with the seriousness\r\nit deserves. We have striven in this Organization to link the\r\nenvironment, human rights, democracy and humanitarian\r\nrelief with development. It is time we realized that\r\npeace-keeping and peacemaking can be carried out\r\nefficiently, and the problems that generate conflicts can be\r\nresolved, only if we promote the issue of development with\r\nvigour. And this can be done if the United Nations insists\r\non a more just, equitable and transparent world economic\r\nsystem that will confer the means for development on all\r\nnations. The task of eradicating global poverty must receive\r\nthe same attention, concentration and energetic action as are\r\ngiven to peace-keeping and peacemaking.\r\nThe democratization process, which is part of the effort\r\nto promote and uphold human rights, should not be limited\r\nto the national level. The full implementation of the\r\nprinciples of democracy within the family of nations should\r\nalso be one of our central concerns. It is in this context that\r\nwe seek the revitalization of the General Assembly, where\r\nthe sovereign equality of Member States finds full\r\nexpression. We look forward to the General Assembly’s\r\nplaying its full role in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security as required by the Charter. We also welcome\r\nthe initiative of the Security Council to make its work,\r\nincluding its decision-making process, more transparent.\r\nSuch transparency will obviously enhance the legitimacy of\r\nits decisions and, equally importantly, reflect the fact that it\r\nis the Members of the Organization which, under Article 24,\r\nconfer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and that in\r\ndischarging its functions the Security Council acts on their\r\nbehalf.\r\nMy delegation sees no need to go over the case, which\r\nhas already been well established, for the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. Suffice it to say that, whatever the final\r\nform of a restructured Security Council, it is clear that its\r\nreform should be based on the principle of the sovereign\r\nequality of Member States and the clear\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nrecognition that the Security Council acts on behalf of the\r\nMembers of the Organization and should reflect the\r\nuniversality of our Organization. The Ghana delegation is\r\nready to participate in the search for a more legitimate and\r\neffective Security Council.\r\nWe welcome the commitment made by\r\nPresident Clinton to ensure the payment of contributions due\r\nfrom the United States in respect of peace-keeping\r\noperations. It is to be hoped that in the years to come the\r\nUnited States, which pays a substantial portion of the United\r\nNations budget, regular and peace-keeping, will continue to\r\nabide by this commitment and also address the question of\r\noutstanding contributions to the regular budget.\r\nIt is the hope of Ghana that this session will mark the\r\nbeginning of the renaissance of the United Nations, ready to\r\ncollectively commit itself to the pursuit of the objectives of\r\nour Organization as reflected in the principles and purposes\r\nof the Charter.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\n"
