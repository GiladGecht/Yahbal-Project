"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n11th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nThursday, 30 September 1993\r\nat 3 p.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.35 p.m.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. LENNART MERI, PRESIDENT OF\r\nTHE REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Estonia.\r\nMr. Lennart Meri, President of the Republic of\r\nEstonia, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Estonia,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Lennart Meri, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident MERI: Before commencing my address, I\r\nwould like to express, on behalf of my nation and myself,\r\nmy sincere sympathy with the people of India on this day of\r\ngreat tragedy.\r\nLet me convey to you, Mr. President, my\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nYour election is a fitting tribute to your personal and\r\nprofessional qualities, and also to your country, the Republic\r\nof Guyana. As an Estonian, I have a special empathy with\r\nyour homeland: much like Estonia, your\r\ncountry was liberated from colonial dependence and became\r\na Member State of the United Nations. Like Estonia, your\r\ncountry remembers that independence is the decisive factor\r\nwhich permits small countries to share with great Powers\r\nequal responsibility for creating a better world, towards\r\nwhich all of us, seated here in this Hall, are striving.\r\nTo your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev,\r\nI express my recognition for his proficiency in chairing the\r\nforty-seventh session. We also express our deep gratitude to\r\nMr. Ganev for visiting Estonia and her sister States Latvia\r\nand Lithuania, and for his efforts to apply the moral\r\nauthority of the United Nations towards removing the\r\nremaining vestiges of colonialism from the Baltic States.\r\nTo our neighbour in the General Assembly, the State of\r\nEritrea, I express my sincerest welcome and congratulations\r\non its finally joining the family of nations.\r\nI would, however, like to take this opportunity to\r\nextend especially warm thanks to the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has given the\r\nUnited Nations and the whole world new hope through his\r\nstrong moral conviction that we need not passively wait for\r\nconflicts to arise, but that conflicts should be prevented from\r\narising; that the United Nations is, in the first place, an\r\narchitect, whose building must not be allowed to be engulfed\r\nin flames; that the Organization is only secondarily a fire-\r\nfighter who rushes to extinguish fires still burning from the\r\npast. This is so even and perhaps especially when,\r\nmetaphorically speaking, it happens that only a poor man’s\r\ncowshed has caught fire - for after all, that was enough to\r\nburn down all of Chicago.\r\nLet me express my appreciation and gratitude for\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali’s radiant moral sense of\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86680 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.11\r\n18 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nresponsibility and for the steadfastness with which he has\r\ndefended the principle of preventive diplomacy. As a small\r\nState, Estonia well understands and desires to support the\r\nSecretary-General fully in his defence of the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations and in the implementation\r\nof preventive diplomacy.\r\nThree years ago, in 1990, I visited the New York\r\nmeeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope as a foreign minister whose entry into the conference\r\nroom was strictly prohibited. I was interviewed by\r\ntelevision journalists in front of United Nations\r\nHeadquarters, as chance had it. I stated then that the next\r\ntime I would be here it would be for the raising of the\r\nEstonian flag. The journalists did not even attempt to hide\r\ntheir polite sympathy nor their desire to bring the interview\r\nquickly to an end. Did they even attempt to present such an\r\n\"unrealistic\" interview on their television programme?\r\nOne year later, in September 1991, I watched the\r\nraising of the Estonian flag on a United Nations flagpole and\r\nconcluded that my mission had been completed. Today I am\r\nhere to tell the Assembly, and perhaps also those\r\nsympathetic journalists, that my work as the first\r\ndemocratically elected post-war Estonian President has only\r\njust begun.\r\nToday my words are infused with self-confidence and\r\nhope. Estonia has been and is once again a State; Estonia\r\nhas re-established its place under the sun. In this sense we\r\nshare common attributes, experiences and goals with the vast\r\nmajority of States represented here today. The majority of\r\nthe States Members of the Assembly are only slightly larger\r\nor slightly smaller than Estonia, with its 47,000 square\r\nkilometres and 1.5 million inhabitants living on the shores of\r\nthe Baltic Sea. Estonia was robbed of its independence and\r\nforced to be the colonial subject of an imperial Power, as\r\nwas the case with the majority of the Members here today.\r\nJust as they did, so have we restored our independence at the\r\ncost of untold suffering. For Estonia, as for most of the\r\nMembers here, this work is still incomplete. The United\r\nNations General Assembly is the best place for uniting our\r\nforces, so that we can work together.\r\nThis however requires that the Second World War\r\nfinally end for Estonia. For the Second World War is still\r\ncontinuing in Estonia in a rather peculiar way, because the\r\nforeign armed forces which occupied Estonia in 1940 still\r\nremain on our territory, regardless of General Assembly\r\nresolution 47/21. Estonia has for two years patiently\r\nconducted negotiations on the withdrawal of these forces, but\r\nwithout positive results. Of course, we were aware that\r\nbehind this rigid position stood the Soviet nomenklatura and\r\nthe Russian so-called parliament, which acted on the basis of\r\nthe Brezhnevite Soviet so-called constitution and whose goal\r\nwas to restore the Soviet Union in a modernized form.\r\nPresident Yeltsin was a prisoner of this imperialistically\r\nminded parliament.\r\nFor this reason, we consider the present moment\r\nespecially opportune for President Yeltsin to strengthen the\r\nworld’s confidence in democracy by withdrawing the\r\nremaining armed forces from Estonia and Latvia and by\r\nsigning international agreements to this effect. This would\r\nguarantee stability and security for the Baltic region, which\r\nis an inseparable part of Europe’s Nordic region - and that\r\nregion, in turn, is an inseparable part of Europe.\r\nIn my correspondence with President Yeltsin I have\r\nemphasized my readiness to meet him in the nearest future.\r\nI would be grateful to the General Assembly, to the Security\r\nCouncil and to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali if,\r\nwith all their collective moral authority, they would help us\r\nrapidly to cut this Gordian knot. This is, after all, not only\r\na problem for Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania: with this effort\r\nthey would also be supporting the democratization of Russia.\r\nWith the implementation of preventive diplomacy, they\r\nwould be removing a potential source of conflict and would\r\nthereby strengthen the prestige of the United Nations itself.\r\nAnd last, but not least, by implementing international law\r\nequally in the interests of great Powers and of small States\r\nthey would give back to all of us the hope that, even in\r\nterms of realpolitik, justice is singular and indivisible.\r\nThe United Nations could mandate such a mission, to\r\nbe led by an authoritative European politician, one in whom\r\nboth Russia and the Baltic States could feel equally\r\nconfident. The time is ripe for action. The rapid preparation\r\nof an international agreement is in the interests of both sides.\r\nWhen two years of negotiations conducted between a great\r\nPower and a small State remain unproductive, it is a sign of\r\ndanger. Preventive diplomacy consists in the ability to\r\nrecognize danger signals at an early stage and resolve them\r\nin a lightning-rod fashion. This is our first problem and our\r\nprimary task.\r\nAt different stages, two different arguments were used\r\nin stalling and detouring the negotiations. First, the Russian\r\nside claimed it would be unable to find housing for forces\r\nwithdrawn from the Baltic States. From a legal standpoint,\r\nthis argument lacks any content whatsoever. The stationing\r\nof foreign forces on the territory of a sovereign State against\r\nthe express will of that State and its people is in\r\ncontradiction with international law and cannot be an item\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 3\r\nfor negotiation. At the same time, I would like to repeat\r\nagain that Estonia is ready, together with its Nordic\r\nneighbours and other partners, and to the extent that its\r\nresources permit, to assist in the solution of this essentially\r\nhumanitarian problem. We are grateful to our friends, who\r\nhave promised housing construction aid in excess of\r\n$200 million, and we are prepared, with the help of these\r\npartners, to mobilize our construction industry towards this\r\nend. We have on several occasions publicly repeated and\r\nconfirmed this readiness to our Russian partner.\r\nThe second argument for the maintenance of foreign\r\narmed forces and their installation on the territory of the\r\nBaltic States is in a curious way linked to human rights.\r\nAccording to this line of thinking, which has been\r\npromulgated primarily in the Western media, the continued\r\npresence of ex-Soviet armed forces in the Baltic States is\r\nrequired for the defence of the human rights of the Russians\r\nresiding there. However, the Russian residents of Estonia\r\nhave never supported this argument, since they have not\r\nwished to become pawns in a political game.\r\nIn this connection, I should like to take the opportunity\r\nto thank you, Mr. President, and you, Mr. Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for the assistance of the United Nations. The\r\nRepublic of Estonia had already enunciated, during the time\r\nof the League of Nations, and now it does so even more\r\nclearly, the basic principle that human rights are not the\r\n\"internal affair\" of any State. For this reason, on the\r\nquestion of human rights in Estonia we turned for expert\r\nopinions and advice not only to the United Nations, but also\r\nto the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,\r\nthe Council of Europe and the Nordic Council. Thus, I can\r\nconfirm that not one of the 15 missions invited by Estonia\r\nto inspect the situation firsthand has found human rights\r\nviolations in Estonia. This has also been emphasized by\r\nmany speakers during this General Assembly session. It was\r\nalso, I am happy to note, emphasized by President Clinton\r\nin our recent meeting.\r\nI am disappointed that the idea of human rights -\r\nwhich, for Estonia, is self-evident and sacrosanct, and for the\r\nlack of which Estonians themselves, during five decades of\r\nCommunist totalitarianism, had to pay with the loss of their\r\npride, their freedom and their blood in Soviet and Nazi\r\nconcentration camps - has been cynically\r\nexploited. The Republic of Estonia was the first State in the\r\nworld to guarantee Jews and other minorities, as early as\r\n1925, the right to cultural autonomy. Estonia will never\r\nstand idly by while anyone tries to manipulate human rights.\r\nFor this reason, Estonia supports the creation of the post of\r\na United Nations high commissioner for human rights and\r\nthe expansion of the United Nations budget earmarked for\r\nthe defence of human rights.\r\nWe wish to work to defend the human rights of all\r\nindigenous peoples. We defended the rights of some\r\nSiberian peoples during the decades of Soviet totalitarianism,\r\nalthough we had to do it alone and quietly. Now we intend\r\nto join forces and to do it, with the help of the United\r\nNations, publicly.\r\nI like to speak of the future in optimistic terms on the\r\nassumption that we are capable of finding resolutions to our\r\npessimistic present, or to be more precise, that we are\r\ncapable of applying these resolutions, since they are already\r\noutlined in Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali’s report \"An Agenda\r\nfor Peace\" (A/47/277). Allow me, Mr. Secretary- General,\r\nto thank you wholeheartedly for the clear analysis and sober\r\nrecommendations on the implementation of such key\r\nconcepts as preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and\r\npeace-keeping. The tragedy in Yugoslavia has reconfirmed\r\nthe fact that fire-fighting is much more difficult than\r\nfire-prevention. This lesson, which is written in the Torah,\r\nthe Bible and the Koran, is, thanks to the Secretary- General,\r\nnow slowly penetrating the consciousness of international\r\norganizations. Preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and\r\npeace-keeping can be a real hope for the United Nations on\r\nthe condition that we learn to recognize danger, where and\r\nwhen it becomes manifest.\r\nHowever, in a potential zone of conflict, peace-keeping\r\nmust be strictly neutral. We must remember the proverb\r\nthat \"You should not let a fox mind the henhouse\", that\r\npeace-keeping in a particular area cannot be turned over to\r\nthose parties that have an obvious interest in the outcome of\r\na conflict. Estonia supports the principles of democracy, the\r\ninviolability of borders and non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of other countries, principles enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter and in other international agreements.\r\nConsequently, we were disturbed - as, I am sure, many\r\nrepresentatives were - by the suggestion of one national\r\nrepresentative that the troops of one country should be\r\nallowed to intervene up to the borders of a State that no\r\nlonger exists. I do not have in mind the former\r\nAustro-Hungarian Empire.\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nEstonia can only support a position whereby the choice\r\nof peace-keeping forces by the Security Council meets the\r\napproval of broad international opinion. On this condition,\r\nEstonia also feels a moral responsibility to participate in\r\ninternational peace-keeping according to its capabilities, as\r\nwell as in other related activities.\r\nThis brings me to the consolidation of democracy and\r\nthe free market economy in Estonia after 50 years of an\r\nabsurd colonial command economy. Estonia has already\r\nbeen successful, but, together with other Members of the\r\nOrganization, we could be even more successful.\r\nDemocracy and the free market economy are interconnected,\r\nbecause they presuppose the right and the responsibility to\r\nfreely choose. The former Soviet Union spent more money\r\non repressing free thought than it ever did on the creation of\r\na nuclear arsenal. The murder of freedom and the birth of\r\naggression are two sides of the same coin. The first enemy\r\nof every totalitarian regime is the domestic enemy, and its\r\nfirst object of attack is free thought. Everyone present\r\nknows Adam Michnik’s wonderful metaphor about how easy\r\nit is to make fish soup from an aquarium, but how difficult\r\nit is to make an aquarium from fish soup.\r\nThe main resource from which we have drawn the\r\nenergy for the transformation of Estonia’s economy has been\r\nthe idealism of the Estonian people. This is a large\r\nresource, but it is not endless. I want to prevent exhaustion\r\nfrom setting in, exhaustion which could be followed by\r\npolitical apathy and thereby by a desire to be free both of\r\nrights and obligations. The replacement of a command\r\neconomy by a market economy is a disintegrative process\r\nboth at the State and individual level as long as the market\r\nhas not started working. Once the market is working, it\r\nworks for economic and political integration. Therefore,\r\nEstonia is more interested in trade, not aid, and therefore we\r\nwork actively to keep and expand our free trade agreements\r\nthrough negotiations with Brussels.\r\nMy aim has been to suggest that the international\r\ncommunity has gained new members - the countries in\r\ntransition. Here the question arises whether the United\r\nNations has realized our special possibilities and our special\r\nneeds. Estonia does not belong in either the first, second or\r\nthird world. Do we really need a fourth world, or do we\r\nneed the ability to react more sensitively to a world which\r\nis in constant dynamic change?\r\nI offer as an example an issue that is as unpleasant to\r\nthe Assembly as it is to me: the division by 15 of the\r\nfinancial commitments of the former Soviet Union, including\r\nits United Nations assessment. Estonia has stated repeatedly,\r\nand I do not hesitate to state here again, that we cannot and\r\nwe will not accept this, as we were never legally part of the\r\nSoviet Union. Times have changed; our world community\r\nmust realize this.\r\nWe also feel a responsibility to assist others as we have\r\nbeen assisted during the past few years. While Estonia is\r\nstill reeling from the disastrous consequences of a 50-year\r\noccupation, we do have well-educated specialists who could\r\nbe of service to the United Nations in parts of the world\r\nwhere their skills would be welcome. And I should like to\r\noffer the experience we have gained in starting up a country\r\nand in creating a new, stable currency.\r\nAllow me to close with some very personal comments.\r\nThe United Nations is approaching its fiftieth anniversary.\r\nThe post-war world is approaching its fiftieth anniversary.\r\nThe United Nations is acting on the basis of an unaltered\r\nCharter. But, as I mentioned above, the world has been\r\naltered totally. This ever-increasing contrast is most strongly\r\nfelt by some of the most sensitive United Nations Members,\r\nthe majority, the small States. I believe that small States\r\nhave the obligation to redefine the international order. The\r\nlarge nations have the larger obligations, the small States the\r\nlarger possibilities. This is not a contradiction, but a\r\nbalance. After all, an Inuit kayak can change its course\r\nimmediately, while a supertanker needs perilously much time\r\nand space to do so.\r\nThe best place to redefine the world order is the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. I am deeply\r\ngrateful to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali who,\r\nsensing this need, has entrusted into our hands his vision of\r\na stable world, entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\". As a\r\nrepresentative of one of Europe’s smallest countries and\r\noldest nations, I should like to suggest that the prevalent\r\ntendency of the past century, and especially the past decades,\r\nhas been an increase in the numbers of small countries and\r\na reduction in the number of large ones. The issue of\r\nincreasing the number of permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil has been introduced into the agenda, and Estonia\r\nsupports this as a step towards accepting today’s new\r\nrealities. Personally, I should like to put to you, members\r\nof the General Assembly, the following question: should the\r\nSecurity Council not also include as a member with veto\r\npower a representative of the world’s majority, the small\r\nnations?\r\nI do not have an answer to this question and neither do\r\nyou. This is not tragic. The opposite would be tragic.\r\nSeeking for answers is the United Nations future and our\r\ncommon hope. Today we speak of the fatal differences\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 5\r\nbetween cultures. Thereby the inevitability of conflicts is\r\nsuggested.\r\nConflicts are not fatal only because someone believes\r\nin Buddha, another in Jehovah, another in Christ or Allah or\r\nthe shamans of Siberia. Cultures have to be different to\r\nallow man, with his rights and duties, to look like man, to\r\nlook like hope. The day before coming here I read a book\r\nby the famous Finnish philosopher Matti Kuusi on what\r\nhope means to man. The Mexican says that you cannot fill\r\nyour stomach with hope, but it will keep the soul in your\r\nmouth; a Kanuri African will say that hope is the pillar; the\r\nFilipino says that daring is the fruit of hope and the Maltese\r\nsays that he who gives up hope dies.\r\nThis diversity is the unity of mankind. And to make it\r\neasier for you to keep the unity of man and the world, I will\r\nadd for salt, pepper and enjoyment a proverb from my\r\nshores, the shores of the Baltic: do not lose your\r\nhopelessness. Hopelessness is the inevitable shadow of\r\nhope, and the ever-persevering United Nations is the\r\ncollective hope of mankind.\r\nI thank you for your hopeful patience.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nEstonia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Lennart Meri, President of the Republic of\r\nEstonia, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. ZLENKO (Ukraine) (spoke in Ukrainian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): In joining my colleagues\r\nin congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the high and\r\nresponsible office of President of the General Assembly, I\r\nshould like to point out that it is a great honour for a\r\npolitician and diplomat to guide the work of this universal\r\nforum representing practically all the States of the world. I\r\nhope that your activities in this important position will\r\npromote substantive discussions at this session and the\r\nadoption of constructive decisions, and that the work of the\r\nforty-eighth session will become a memorable page in your\r\nbiography.\r\nAt the same time, I should like to thank Mr. Ganev,\r\nPresident of the previous session of the General Assembly,\r\nfor his contribution to the Assembly’s work.\r\nSoon we shall commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe Teheran Conference, whose decisions laid down the\r\nfoundations of the United Nations. It was 50 years ago that\r\nthe participants in that Conference, while discussing the\r\nissue of creating an international organization, expressed\r\nconfidence that the accord among them would ensure lasting\r\npeace, and declared the lofty responsibility of all the United\r\nNations in safeguarding peace for succeeding generations.\r\nAs long ago as 1918, an outstanding Ukrainian\r\npolitician and writer, Mikhail Hrushevskiy, stated that\r\n\"Properly creating history is more important than depicting\r\nit positively\".\r\nWe are proud of the fact that Ukraine took an active\r\npart in laying down the foundation of the Organization and\r\nthat today, along with other members of the international\r\ncommunity, it is making a worthy contribution to attaining\r\nthe noble goals of the United Nations. To our mind, the\r\nmajor result of nearly 50 years of the Organization’s\r\nexistence is the fact that world war has been averted. This\r\nis to the credit of the United Nations, a universal forum of\r\nStates, a unique Organization without which it is impossible\r\nto imagine present-day international relations.\r\nToday, when the new dominant feature of international\r\nrelations is the transition from bipolarity to a qualitatively\r\ndifferent world order based on comprehensive security and\r\na balance of interests, the world is witnessing the second\r\nbirth of the United Nations. For Ukraine, it is of special\r\nsignificance that the United Nations renaissance coincides\r\nwith the building of our independence, our regained\r\nstatehood and the revival of Ukraine as a sovereign\r\nparticipant in European and world politics.\r\nFor Ukraine, which today is trying to find its place in\r\nthe world balance of power, its United Nations membership\r\nis one of the most important international guarantees of its\r\nnational security and independence. After the disintegration\r\nof the USSR and the disappearance of the Warsaw Treaty\r\nOrganization, our country is compelled to exist next to a\r\nzone of decreased stability and of alienation and even\r\ntension, irrespective of who is the initiator and what is the\r\nsubject of discord. Ukraine finds itself in the epicentre of\r\nalmost all European developments: every crisis emerging on\r\nthe continent may affect us in one way or another.\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThese factors led to the initiative by Mr. Leonid\r\nKravchuk, the President of Ukraine, concerning the creation\r\nin the Central and East European region of a space of\r\nstability and security which would include all countries in\r\nthe Baltic and Black Sea zone and that would become, in the\r\nfuture, an integral part of the European system of security.\r\nAt the same time, this Central and East European space of\r\nstability and security would be a reliable link for developing\r\na broad-based transatlantic system of security taking in the\r\narea from Vancouver to Vladivostok, that is, the whole\r\nregion covered by the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE). Implementation of this idea\r\nwould be a worthy contribution to preventive diplomacy.\r\nThe basic prerequisite for the creation of such a space\r\nmight be the implementation of the principle of security for\r\noneself through security for all, the main goal of which\r\nwould be the development of a system of international\r\nrelations in the region that would rule out threats to peace\r\nand stability such as those emanating from the present\r\nconflicts on the territories of the former Yugoslavia and\r\nUSSR.\r\nUkraine is capable of playing a constructive role in the\r\nformation of such a system. As a State which is situated in\r\nthe centre of the European continent and possesses vast\r\nhuman resources and scientific potential and a strong\r\nindustrial and agricultural complex, Ukraine is ready to\r\ncontribute more to the formation of a new, prosperous\r\nEurope. In accordance with the principles of a new Europe,\r\nwe aspire to build a democratic State of law that is\r\neconomically strong, politically active, peaceful and, in the\r\nfuture, non-nuclear along with others, in which individual\r\nrights are respected and guaranteed regardless of nationality\r\nor other distinctions.\r\nIn this context, I should like to dwell on the problem of\r\nnuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine. As is well\r\nknown, we inherited from the former USSR a huge nuclear\r\narsenal, the third largest in the world in terms of its combat\r\npotential. The declaration on the State sovereignty of\r\nUkraine proclaimed the intention of our State to become\r\nnon-nuclear in the future.\r\nAnd this is not a mere declaration. Ukraine is doing as\r\nmuch as it can towards its implementation. The dismantling\r\nof the strategic missile complexes has started. An agreement\r\nhas been signed with Russia on the utilization of the\r\nstrategic missiles’ nuclear warheads. We do not exclude the\r\npossibility of conducting negotiations on this subject with a\r\nthird party.\r\nHowever, the full-scale implementation of the nuclear\r\ndisarmament programme is linked to the need to solve a\r\nnumber of problems. Where do we get the money to\r\ndismantle and eliminate the strategic nuclear weapons\r\nlocated in Ukraine? According to our estimates,\r\napproximately $2.8 billion are needed for these purposes.\r\nHow do we ensure reliable guarantees of national security\r\nfor our State?\r\nThere arises also the problem of returning to Ukraine -\r\nor obtaining compensation for - nuclear components,\r\nobtained from nuclear warheads, which, after reprocessing,\r\ncan be used as fuel for nuclear power stations. This also\r\napplies to the nuclear materials extracted from the warheads\r\nof tactical missiles removed from Ukraine in 1992.\r\nAnd finally, what should the thousands of servicemen\r\ndismissed from the missile forces do? We have no complete\r\nanswers to these and other questions; so far the promises of\r\nhelp exist only in statements and on paper.\r\nThe Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament, is\r\ndeeply involved in these questions and is looking for\r\nopportunities to adopt balanced decisions, in the shortest\r\npossible time, taking into consideration the interests both of\r\nUkraine and of the international community as a whole.\r\nAt the same time, I should like to stress that while\r\nconsidering this issue we should also take into account the\r\nexternal situation. For today, instability and internal\r\nstruggles in neighbouring countries sometimes spill over\r\ntheir frontiers and threaten Ukraine’s national security and\r\nterritorial integrity. This is most especially so in the case of\r\nthe well-known decision by the, now former, Supreme\r\nSoviet of the Russian Federation concerning the status of\r\nSevastopol. There have also been attempts to question the\r\nstatus of Crimea as a whole. In this connection, I should\r\nlike to state explicitly that the Republic of Crimea is an\r\ninseparable part of Ukraine. Crimea, as a part of Ukraine,\r\ncould play an appropriate role in the region and make a\r\ndecisive contribution to consolidating the Black Sea region\r\nas a zone of peace and stability. In this context, I should\r\nlike to express profound gratitude to all the countries,\r\nespecially to the members of the Security Council, that gave\r\ntheir unambiguous assessment of the illegal encroachments\r\nupon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and\r\nmanifested their support for our State. Again, we are\r\nconvinced that the complicated issues of inter-State relations\r\ncan be solved only through firm and energetic action on the\r\npart of the international community.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 7\r\nIn our opinion, the objective basis for cooperation\r\nbetween Ukraine and other countries lies in the formation of\r\na stable and secure system of international relations. In the\r\npresent circumstances, the basis of this system is respect for\r\nthe principal postulates of international law, according to\r\nwhich the inviolability of the frontiers and territorial integrity\r\nof sovereign States is recognized as one of the prerequisites\r\nfor international peace and security. The former empires\r\nhave vanished, and like them imperialistic thinking, such as\r\nunilateral interpretations by certain States of legal succession\r\nissues and their other actions that are incompatible with the\r\nnorms and ethics of international relations should also\r\ndisappear.\r\nWe hope that an understanding of contemporary\r\nrealities will facilitate the further normalization and\r\ndevelopment of Ukraine’s relations with other countries on\r\nterms of mutual respect, a balanced search for compromises\r\nand the renunciation of extreme rhetoric. Genuine\r\nconditions for such developments are already in existence,\r\nand it is a worthwhile task to use them to foster mutually\r\nbeneficial economic relations and to ensure wide-ranging\r\ncontacts between peoples.\r\nUkraine, as one of the founders of the Commonwealth\r\nof Independent States, is actively developing cooperation\r\nwith the CIS countries. We regard the Commonwealth as an\r\ninternational mechanism for multilateral consultations and\r\ntalks that is contributing to the process of forming\r\nqualitatively new full-scale, bilateral relations between\r\nparticipating States and is promoting solutions to the\r\nproblems that they face after the disintegration of the USSR.\r\nOur relations with the Baltic States are developing in a\r\npositive way.\r\nUkraine unswervingly supports the efforts of the world\r\ncommunity to find a formula for settling the conflict in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. We consider that a real solution to this\r\nproblem is possible only through taking into account the\r\ninterests of all States in the region, and those of ethnic\r\ncommunities, on the basis of the relevant decisions by the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council and of the cornerstone\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nWe take it as given that all countries involved in the\r\nattempt to settle this conflict, and the relevant international\r\nstructures, must approach the issue very carefully, especially\r\nwhen the use of force is implied. It must be borne in mind\r\nthat the use of force might lead to extremely undesirable\r\nconsequences, frustrate the negotiating process and result in\r\nan escalation in the conflict and its spread to other areas of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia.\r\nOur position on the settlement of conflicts on the\r\nterritory of the former Soviet Union is similar. In this\r\nconnection, we should like to welcome the role played by\r\nthe United Nations and the CSCE in Transdnestria and the\r\njoint efforts of the international community in searching for\r\nways to stop the bloodshed in Nagorny-Karabakh.\r\nTragic developments have taken place in Georgia.\r\nSigned agreements have been violated, the bloodshed persists\r\nand people continue to perish. As long ago as\r\n21 September, Leonid Kravchuk, the President of Ukraine,\r\nappealed to the President of the Russian Federation, which\r\nis a guarantor of the tripartite truce agreement of\r\n27 July 1993, and to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations to take all possible measures to stop the escalation\r\nof the conflict and to activate the mechanism contained in\r\nthe agreement. Regrettably, the attempts to stop the\r\ndangerous developments have been frustrated and the\r\nsituation is running out of control, threatening the stability\r\nof the Caucasus region as a whole. The international\r\ncommunity should immediately call on the potential of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter in order to bring the situation back\r\nonto a course of settlement through political dialogue.\r\nAt the same time, I should like to draw attention to a\r\ntruth that is as old as the hills but which is regrettably often\r\nforgotten: preventing disease is much cheaper and more\r\neffective than treating them. A similar idea was expressed\r\nyesterday by Mr. Kinkel, my colleague from Germany. An\r\nemphasis on active, preventive diplomacy that would\r\nforestall conflicts should become the dominant feature of\r\ncontemporary international relations. The fact that the issue\r\nof Sevastopol was addressed at a meeting of the United\r\nNations Security Council, the activities of the CSCE\r\nmissions in Kosovo, Sanjak and Vojvodina, and the\r\ndeployment of United Nations military contingents in The\r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are, to our mind,\r\ngood examples that illustrate this truth.\r\nIn fact, reviving the peacemaking activities of the\r\nUnited Nations has become one of the more vivid examples\r\nof the transformation in United Nations political thinking,\r\nand is embodied in the conclusion that diplomatic language\r\nshould replace the language of the gun in inter-State\r\ncommunication.\r\nUkraine is taking an active part in this process. More\r\nthan a year has elapsed since a Ukrainian battalion was sent\r\nto the former Yugoslavia to participate in the United Nations\r\npeace-keeping forces. From the point of view of Ukraine,\r\nas a new and independent State, the multilateral peace-\r\nkeeping efforts of the United Nations remain the\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nOrganization’s most effective instruments in its performance\r\nof its major function, the ensuring of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Ukraine is ready to continue active participation in\r\nthe peace-keeping activities carried out under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations or the CSCE.\r\nThe prestige and authority that Ukraine has gained as\r\na result of its participation in United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations have not come easily. Lately, human losses\r\namong peace-keepers from the United Nations Blue Helmets\r\nhave increased. The rise in the number of peace-keeping\r\noperations and their expansion may result in further losses.\r\nThat is why it is our belief that it is urgently necessary to\r\nwork out a document to define the status of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping personnel and to make provision for a\r\nmechanism to protect them. This would be a logical\r\ndevelopment of the provisions of resolution 47/72, adopted\r\nby the General Assembly at the initiative of Ukraine, with\r\nsponsorship by over 50 States, and of the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolution, resolution 868 (1993) of\r\n29 September 1993.\r\nUkraine is interested in strengthening peace, security\r\nand stability in the nearby Middle East region and welcomes\r\nthe decisions reached between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization on mutual recognition and the\r\nagreement on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza strip and\r\nJericho signed on 13 September in Washington. The first,\r\nimportant step has thus been taken on the road to a complete\r\nsettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\r\nUkraine welcomes the developments in South Africa,\r\nwhich make it possible to lift economic sanctions against\r\nthat country. We hope that wisdom and a balanced approach\r\nby all the participants in the negotiating process in that\r\ncountry, and active work on the part of the Transitional\r\nExecutive Council, will become a solid basis for the\r\nsuccessful holding of elections and the formation of a\r\ndemocratic, non-racial and united South Africa.\r\nOur State is paying great attention to the experience of\r\nthe countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The extraordinarily\r\nfast pace of developments in some of the countries in this\r\nregion is evidence of the effectiveness of pragmatic\r\napproaches to solving complex political, economic and social\r\nissues.\r\nThe process of a practical development of relations with\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\ncountries has been initiated. We see this grouping as\r\npotentially one of the best trade and economic partners for\r\nUkraine, inasmuch as trade between the ASEAN States - and\r\nthe region as a whole - and the countries of Eastern and\r\nCentral Europe flows through Ukrainian ports.\r\nWe shall facilitate by all possible means the\r\ndevelopment, and the maintenance on the proper level, of\r\nrelations with the States of Europe, North and South\r\nAmerica, the Middle East and Africa.\r\nI should like to dwell briefly on the present-day\r\nsituation in Ukraine. Frankly, we are experiencing difficult\r\ntimes now. In addition to the establishment of our own\r\nState and the rebirth of our national culture and spirit, we\r\nare undergoing a transformation to a new system with new\r\ncivic and economic parameters. Our scholars, specialists and\r\nstatesmen have not yet succeeded in proposing a programme\r\nof economic reforms in keeping with Ukraine’s real\r\npotential, its historical traditions and the mind-set of its\r\npeople. And now we have to make major adjustments to the\r\nprocedure and sequence of the reform process.\r\nOur goal is a market, socially-oriented economic\r\nsystem, directed at meeting the needs of our people. It\r\nshould take into account economic interrelations that were,\r\nobjectively, formed in the CIS, opportunities for foreign\r\ninvestment in our economy, and a step-by-step integration of\r\nthe Ukrainian economy into that of the European Community\r\nand the world.\r\nImportant steps have been taken in this regard. By\r\nadopting a law on ownership, the Verkhovna Rada has\r\nopened the road to privatization as the principal means for\r\nthe transition to market-based economic relations. Important\r\ndocuments have been approved concerning the\r\ndenationalization and privatization of enterprises, land and\r\nhousing. Ukraine has declared its intention to become an\r\nassociate member of the CIS economic union, and is\r\nengaged in active negotiations within the framework of the\r\nCommission of the European Communities.\r\nHowever, the situation in the State remains extremely\r\ncomplicated.\r\nIn overcoming the crisis, the international community,\r\nincluding our compatriots abroad - the representatives of the\r\nUkrainian diaspora - could play an important role. Our\r\nlegislation sets out favourable conditions for foreign\r\ninvestment in the Ukrainian economy, and a number of\r\nmeasures have been adopted concerning participation by our\r\nState in the European and world communities and the\r\ndevelopment of bilateral trade and economic relations.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 9\r\nIt is important to find areas that could appeal to our\r\npartners and to proceed to develop and implement specific\r\ncooperation programmes and projects. An example of this\r\nkind of cooperation can be seen in the activities that we have\r\ninitiated with Commission of the European Communities and\r\nin the framework of the Black Sea economic cooperation.\r\nWe are also ready to participate actively in carrying out\r\nthe economic programmes being implemented within the\r\nframework of the United Nations.\r\nIn this context, we are heartened by the increasing\r\nattention being paid by the United Nations and its bodies and\r\nby the economically developed countries to the processes of\r\ntransition to the market economy being undertaken in the\r\nEastern and Central European States. Favourable conditions\r\nfor broadening cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nStates with economies in transition, including Ukraine, have\r\nopened up as a result of the formation of integrated missions\r\nby the United Nations and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme in this field. We hope that these missions will\r\nbe given permanent status.\r\nWe place great hope in assistance by the international\r\ncommunity in mitigating the consequences of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster. I must say that after the appointment of United\r\nNations Under-Secretary-General Mr. Eliasson as the United\r\nNations Coordinator of International Cooperation for\r\nChernobyl, activities in this area have acquired new impetus.\r\nI hope his efforts will find support in the General Assembly\r\nand will contribute to strengthening international cooperation\r\nfor this purpose.\r\nIn addition to the expenditures needed to mitigate the\r\nafter-effects of the Chernobyl disaster, which account for a\r\nconsiderable part of the national income, the losses resulting\r\nfrom the imposition of economic sanctions by the Security\r\nCouncil against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have\r\nbecome another great negative factor for our economy.\r\nConsequently, by the end of 1993, Ukraine will have\r\nsuffered direct losses of more than $4 billion in the State\r\nsector alone.\r\nToday we need real efforts on the part of the\r\ninternational community to assist Ukraine in overcoming the\r\nnegative impact of the sanctions against the Federal Republic\r\nof Yugoslavia on Ukraine’s economy as well as on the\r\neconomies of a number of other countries. Our delegation\r\nis ready to propose a draft resolution which would deal with\r\nthe implementation of the relevant recommendations of the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly.\r\nRegretfully, the serious economic difficulties associated\r\nwith the factors that I have mentioned were not taken into\r\nconsideration when the international community last year\r\nadopted the decision, contrary to the provisions of the United\r\nNations Charter, to increase Ukraine’s contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations regular budget by 58 per cent. The\r\nassessment imposed on Ukraine is not fully commensurate\r\nwith its capacity to pay, and is a great burden on its\r\neconomy. As a result of great efforts, this year we have\r\nmanaged to contribute $6.5 million to the United Nations\r\nregular budget, which otherwise could have been directed at\r\nsolving the problems caused by Chernobyl. However, we\r\ncannot meet our financial obligations in full, for the reasons\r\nI have mentioned.\r\nIn this context, the Government of Ukraine urges a\r\nreconsideration of the scale of assessments for the United\r\nNations regular budget and an amendment of the existing\r\nsystem of financing United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations. Our delegation is ready to offer grounds for this\r\nposition during discussion of the relevant items by the Fifth\r\nCommittee.\r\nThe world has experienced great changes since the\r\nfoundation of the United Nations. This is understandable,\r\nfor, as Heraclitus said, \"Nothing endures but change\". That\r\nis why the issue of reforming the United Nations system is\r\na quite natural one. Current realities raise new problems for\r\nthe world community. Even though the danger of a global\r\nnuclear conflict has been practically eliminated, the \"local\"\r\nwars and regional conflicts breaking out all over the world\r\nare causing serious concern.\r\nInterethnic armed conflicts and economic instability\r\ncreate favourable grounds for terrorism, the arms trade and\r\nthe production and trafficking of drugs, and directly affect\r\nthe security of United Nations Member States. The\r\nChernobyl nuclear power station disaster, the environmental\r\ndisorder in the Aral Sea area, the danger of an ecological\r\ncatastrophe as a result of destruction of tropical forests and\r\nthe depletion of the Earth’s ozone layer are but a very\r\nincomplete list of the ecological problems facing mankind.\r\nThe need for change is also becoming especially urgent\r\nand even inevitable as a result of the significant events of\r\nthe past few years that have radically redrawn the political\r\nmap of the world; more than two dozen new independent\r\nStates have emerged, thus considerably increasing the United\r\nNations family. Let me extend to them my sincere\r\ncongratulations.\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nUkraine shares the view that the present quantitative\r\ncomposition of the Security Council, its functioning and its\r\nworking methods require appropriate adjustments, taking into\r\nconsideration the new regional realities and the appearance\r\nof new participants in the international community.\r\nImplementing this proposal would increase the Council’s\r\ndegree of legitimacy as the body that is entrusted by the\r\nUnited Nations Member States with the principal\r\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. At the same time, it is important to preserve the\r\nCouncil’s ability to respond effectively to emergencies that\r\nrequire prompt intervention.\r\nIn changing the structure of the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil, it is very important to take into account the\r\nexistence, beyond its present membership, of participants in\r\nthe international community that are potentially capable of\r\nplaying an important role in the Organization’s activities at\r\nthe present time and that have substantial financial\r\nobligations to the United Nations. It is also very important\r\nto preserve in the Security Council the basic principle of\r\nequitable geographic representation.\r\nThe working methods of the most representative United\r\nNations body - the General Assembly - also require\r\nmodification. It is in our interest to direct its activities, to\r\nthe maximum possible extent, towards further consolidating\r\nthe principles of justice, democracy and development. The\r\ndelegation of Ukraine supports the decisions of the forty-\r\nseventh session aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and at rationalizing the work of its Main\r\nCommittees.\r\nWe are ready for further dialogue on the issues\r\nconcerning structural changes in the sessional and subsidiary\r\nbodies of the General Assembly. This means, in particular,\r\nfurther decreasing the number of resolutions that are\r\nrepeated and duplicated from year to year and redistributing\r\nthe functions of subsidiary bodies.\r\nIn our view, the reform should also involve the\r\nactivities of the main economic and social forum of the\r\nUnited Nations, the Economic and Social Council, and\r\nshould also be reflected in the structure and working\r\nmethods of the Organization’s Secretariat. Ukraine fully\r\nsupports the actions of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the\r\nSecretary-General, aimed at extending the reforms in the\r\nSecretariat, and who is acting firmly in order to increase\r\nthe role and authority of the Organization, in keeping with\r\nthe requirements of the time. We are facing the task of\r\nreorienting the United Nations social and economic activities\r\nin order to implement specific projects in the interest of all\r\nStates, including those now on the way to the free market.\r\nFor the reforms to be successful, it is also important to\r\nensure, in practice, real zero growth in the Organization’s\r\nbudget, and the effective use of its financial assets by\r\nreorientating them towards priority fields of activity.\r\nThe United Nations will soon mark its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. This jubilee is a special date in the calendar of\r\ninternational life, but, moreover, it will be celebrated at the\r\nturn of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is well\r\nknown that all historic dates look towards the future.\r\nTherefore, the best way to celebrate this anniversary is to\r\nconcentrate on outstanding issues, analyse the emerging\r\nsituation and determine what the prospects are for future\r\ndevelopment. That is why, perhaps, it is time for the world\r\ncommunity to get together, as it did after the world wars,\r\nand creatively reappraise the realities of the\r\npost-confrontational period and, where necessary, amend\r\nexisting structures of security and cooperation and division\r\nof labour in order to determine the world order for the\r\ntwenty-first century. These are the considerations that\r\nimpelled President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine to initiate\r\nthe idea of convening, within the framework of the United\r\nNations fiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1995, a global\r\ninternational peace summit conference.\r\nIn advancing the idea of holding such an event under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations, we take it as given that\r\nthis is the Organization that can convene global conferences\r\nof Ministers and Heads of States or Governments in order to\r\nweigh up complex issues and suggest comprehensive\r\nsolutions. Therefore, all our thoughts today are directed\r\ntowards tomorrow, to which we should come having\r\ndiscarded the heavy burden of the confrontational era and\r\nhaving drawn upon the best of the Organization’s past\r\nactivities, which have enriched us with invaluable\r\nknowledge. From the collective wisdom manifested in the\r\nactivities of the United Nations, we can tap the optimism so\r\nnecessary for mankind today, and the faith in its positive\r\nstrength and in its future.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to cite some words by\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, which he\r\npronounced during his recent visit to Ukraine:\r\n\"Deep involvement in the great currents of history\r\ngives Ukraine a special insight into the world today. It\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 11\r\nqualifies Ukraine to play a full role in the new United\r\nNations.\"\r\nI wish to assure you that Ukraine will spare no effort in\r\ncontinuing to prove the rightness of his words.\r\nMr. DURÃO BARROSO (Portugal) (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; English text furnished by the delegation):\r\nMr. President, I should like to begin by congratulating you\r\non your election to the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nand by expressing our confidence in your ability to steer the\r\nproceedings of the present session.\r\nI also express our gratitude to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, for the dedicated way in which he\r\nfulfilled his mandate and contributed to the rationalization of\r\nthe work of the Assembly.\r\nI also congratulate the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose initiative and commitment\r\nhave already made it possible to take important steps\r\ntowards a thorough reform of the United Nations and\r\ntowards strengthening its international credibility as an\r\nirreplaceable instrument of peace.\r\nThe universal calling of the United Nations, enshrined\r\nin its Charter, gives special meaning to the accession of six\r\nnew Member States, Andorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea,\r\nthe Slovak Republic, Monaco and the Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia; they have reinforced the legitimacy\r\nof this forum and assumed, before the international\r\ncommunity, the responsibility entailed in the full exercise of\r\nnational sovereignty.\r\nMy Belgian colleague, in his capacity as current\r\nPresident of the Council of Ministers of the European\r\nCommunities, has already had the opportunity to make a\r\nstatement on behalf of the 12 member States; Portugal fully\r\nsubscribes to that statement. I should, however, like to refer\r\nto a number of issues that are of particular importance to my\r\ncountry.\r\nThe period of global transition now before us is marked\r\nby particularly contradictory signs.\r\nOn the one hand, the détente that surfaced with the end\r\nof the cold war has led to an increase in regional integration\r\nand the strengthening of cooperation between States, and has\r\nbrought to life the concept of complementing the activities\r\nof the United Nations with those of regional organizations\r\nand arrangements.\r\nOn the other hand, violent nationalistic claims have\r\nre-emerged and old and seemingly forgotten antagonisms\r\nhave resurfaced, leading to an unexpected outbreak of\r\nconflicts that threaten the internal cohesion of States and\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn this context, and more so than ever, the role of the\r\nUnited Nations collective security system, now back on the\r\nfront line of international relations, seems decisive. For this\r\nreason, we attach great significance to the ongoing\r\nrestructuring of the Secretariat. We also deem particularly\r\nimportant the reform of the Security Council, which has\r\nspecial responsibilities and is now free to accomplish its\r\noriginal mission and to emerge as the driving force behind\r\nthe Organization’s political activities in maintaining stability\r\nand peace.\r\nOther organizations, such as the European Community,\r\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),\r\nhave, in their turn, an important role to play in consolidating\r\ndemocracy, maintaining stability and promoting development\r\nin the entire European region.\r\nIt is essential for close cooperation to be established\r\nbetween those bodies and the United Nations - which has a\r\nprimary and universal responsibility - so as to avoid\r\nduplication and to enhance what each can contribute to the\r\nsearch for peace and stability.\r\nPeace-keeping operations have recently undergone a\r\nconsiderable expansion, and we are witnessing the\r\ndeployment of large numbers of men and women in\r\nsituations of various natures, including the protection of\r\nhumanitarian assistance missions and preventive diplomacy\r\ninitiatives. The involvement of military contingents in those\r\noperations requires clear political aims as well as unity of\r\ncommand and close and permanent coordination between the\r\nSecretariat and the interested parties, namely the contributing\r\nStates and those States that may be able to offer, in a\r\nconstructive manner, a political contribution to the peace\r\nprocesses.\r\nResolving the conflicts of today, building peace and\r\npreventing the conflicts of tomorrow will be no simple task.\r\nThe demands and expectations that fall upon the United\r\nNations have no historical precedent, and so every effort\r\nmust be made to turn \"An Agenda for Peace\" into a reality.\r\nOnly then will the Organization be able to cope with\r\nthe present and future challenges of maintaining peace,\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ngiving humanitarian assistance and providing aid for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nUnfortunately, as I speak, the United Nations is\r\nconfronting its greatest financial crisis in 48 years of\r\nexistence and is facing the risk of not being able to assume\r\nits responsibilities in the important domain of maintaining\r\ninternational security.\r\nThis question remains the cornerstone of the future\r\nactivity of the United Nations. If it remains unanswered, the\r\nconsequences for the United Nation credibility and for world\r\npeace will be dramatic.\r\nAn important development that has resulted from the\r\nend of the cold war concerns respect for human rights,\r\nwhich are inalienable and universal and figure above all\r\nother considerations when we look at a particular political\r\nregime or model of society. We believe that it is necessary\r\nfor the international community today to judge violations of\r\nhuman rights without double standards.\r\nIn this respect, I should like to stress the importance of\r\nthe final declaration of the Vienna Conference, which\r\nemphasizes fundamental ideas and principles, specifically,\r\nthose that concern the responsibilities of the international\r\ncommunity in this area and define human rights as a priority\r\nfor the United Nations. With this aim, it is now urgent for\r\nthe General Assembly to discuss, without delay, the\r\nestablishment of the post of high commissioner for human\r\nrights.\r\nA commonality of values that reflect the dignity of the\r\nhuman person is an indispensable component of a better\r\ninternational order allowing the development of peaceful and\r\nlasting international relations. Thus, together with peace,\r\ndevelopment and democracy, we consider human rights to be\r\none of the basic principles that should govern international\r\nsociety.\r\nIt is precisely because of the imperatives of human\r\nsolidarity, and because we believe that the international\r\ncommunity has an important role to play, that Portugal, both\r\nas a State and as a member of the European Community, is\r\nfollowing with deep concern the conflict that, for the last\r\ntwo years, has been devastating parts of the territory of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. Portugal reiterates its firm position that\r\nonly a settlement accepted by the three parties can put an\r\nend to this blood-stained chapter in European history.\r\nThe Portuguese Government truly regrets the\r\ninterruption of the latest negotiating round in Geneva at a\r\ntime when an agreement seemed within reach.\r\nWe once again urge all the parties involved in the\r\nconflict to show the necessary good will and flexibility so as\r\nto put an end to the suffering of the affected populations.\r\nPortugal considers that it is extremely urgent for a viable\r\nand just peace agreement to be signed: Only thus will the\r\nconditions for a return to peace be met.\r\nLastly, I wish to pay a tribute to the United Nations\r\nProtection Force - in which Portugal has the privilege of\r\nbeing included - to the European Community monitoring\r\nmission and to all humanitarian organizations operating in\r\nthe area of the former Yugoslavia for the tasks they have\r\nperformed under circumstances of particular hardship.\r\nPortugal, a country which is historically and culturally\r\nlinked to Africa, is profoundly aware of the unparalleled,\r\nappalling and ever-deteriorating living conditions prevailing\r\nin vast regions of the continent. Today, Africa certainly\r\ndeserves the international community’s special attention. It\r\nis in Africa that we should concentrate our principal efforts\r\nto end wars that are sometimes forgotten, but that are laying\r\nwaste to large areas, and it is to Africa that we should be\r\ndirecting economic resources in quantities commensurate\r\nwith the unparalleled scale of the problems it is facing.\r\nOnly by increasing trade flows, economic ties and\r\nhumanitarian assistance can we provide a degree of certainty\r\nfor the success of democratization and progress.\r\nI should like to refer also to the utmost importance that\r\nwe attach to the work of the Organization of African Unity\r\nin the search for solutions to bring an end to the conflicts\r\nthat overshadow Africa.\r\nIn Africa, there are five countries that officially use\r\nPortuguese. With these countries we have steadily deepened\r\nour ties in all areas. Based on a common culture and values,\r\nwe are developing, together with Brazil and these African\r\ncountries, a true community of Portuguese-speaking nations\r\nthat is characterized by solidarity and tolerance.\r\nIt was precisely because of these special ties that my\r\nGovernment interceded in the Angolan conflict. The\r\nmediation efforts it deployed there, together with the United\r\nStates and Russia, resulted in the signing in Lisbon of the\r\nAcordos de Paz on 31 May 1991. The year and a half of\r\npeace that followed those agreements raised in all the\r\nAngolan people the legitimate expectation that almost\r\n30 years of war were coming to an end. It also revealed\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 13\r\nstimulating signs of economic recovery and the advent of a\r\nnew era of democracy and national reconciliation. Angolans\r\ntherefore participated massively in the elections of last\r\nSeptember. The resurgence of war in Angola cause by\r\nUNITA’s failure to accept the results of the elections calls\r\nfor a new effort from the international community to re--\r\nestablish the cease-fire and to safeguard the democratic\r\nprocess, in accordance with the legitimate wishes for peace\r\nand democracy of the Angolan people.\r\nPortugal welcomed the adoption on 15 September of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 864 (1993), in which the\r\nCouncil, in the wake of previous resolutions and under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, decided\r\nupon a set of important measures.\r\nI remain convinced that dialogue is possible, and that\r\nonly through direct negotiations between the Government of\r\nAngola and UNITA can a lasting solution and a durable\r\npeace be found. I therefore once again urge UNITA to\r\nreturn to the negotiating table, on the basis of the Acordos\r\nde Paz and full acceptance of the outcome of the\r\nSeptember 1992 elections and the Abidjan guidelines, which\r\nwere reached with the invaluable help of President\r\nHouphouet-Boigny and the Government of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nI applaud the peace initiatives undertaken by the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, to which Portugal,\r\ntogether with the two other countries of the troika of\r\nobservers, the United States and Russia, has given its\r\nstrongest support.\r\nOnly with the restoration of peace will it be possible to\r\nbring about an end to the suffering of the Angolan people\r\nand make possible the provision of the much-needed\r\nhumanitarian assistance that the international community is\r\nready to provide. In this respect, the efforts already made\r\nby the specialized agencies of the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross are to be\r\ncommended.\r\nRegarding Mozambique, the role of the United Nations\r\nin conducting the peace process is for us a source of\r\nsatisfaction. In this context, we welcome the adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 850 (1993), which is a sign of\r\nthe Organization’s unequivocal commitment to bringing this\r\nprocess to a satisfactory conclusion.\r\nPortugal is deeply involved in the Mozambique peace\r\nprocess, not only through its active contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations Operation in Mozambique but also through\r\nits participation in the structures created by the General\r\nPeace Agreement and through our contributions pledged\r\nduring the donors’ conference last December.\r\nWe also welcome the results of the recent meeting\r\nbetween the President of Mozambique and the leader of\r\nRENAMO, which represented a breakthrough and gave\r\nreason for hope in a future of peace and prosperity in\r\nMozambique.\r\nThe positive outcome of that meeting, namely, the\r\nagreement on the issues of territorial administration and\r\npolice, has been recognized by Security Council resolution\r\n863 (1993), in which all parties are urged to implement\r\nwithout delay all the provisions of the General Peace\r\nAgreement so that the elections can be held in October 1994\r\nat the latest.\r\nConcerning South Africa, we are following events there\r\nclosely, in particular the multiparty negotiations, which we\r\nhope will meet with success and constitute the foundations\r\nof a new, multiracial reality.\r\nThe withdrawal of significant forces in South African\r\nsociety from those negotiations is a cause for concern, and\r\ncould have a negative impact on the normal course of the\r\ntransition process, which, as we all hope, will end with the\r\nholding of elections next year.\r\nThe spread of violence in South Africa provides a\r\nspecial cause for concern, as pointed out by the European\r\nCommunity observer mission in South Africa and the\r\nGoldstone Commission, in both of which Portugal is\r\nparticipating actively. We deeply regret the violence, which\r\ncannot but jeopardize the path to national reconciliation.\r\nWe must stress, however, the positive aspect, namely\r\nthe progress achieved with the 7 September agreement at the\r\nmultiparty negotiations on the creation of the Transitional\r\nExecutive Council. This was achieved by the efforts of the\r\nvarious parties that believe in a consensus solution for the\r\npolitical transition in South Africa.\r\nI should also like to refer to Mr. Nelson Mandela’s\r\npraiseworthy appeal, before the Special Committee against\r\nApartheid, for an end to the economic sanctions imposed\r\nagainst South Africa, an appeal which constitutes a valuable\r\nencouragement to the process of political reform initiated by\r\nPresident F. W. de Klerk.\r\nLeaving now the African continent, I would say that\r\nPortugal, because of its very important legal, moral and\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nhistoric responsibilities in the case, continues to devote, as\r\na matter of priority, particular attention to the question of\r\nEast Timor, a Non-Self-Governing Territory recognized by\r\nthe United Nations as being under Portuguese administration,\r\nits decolonization process not having been completed.\r\nI should like to reaffirm, at this rostrum, my country’s\r\nposition of principle on this question: Portugal accepts in\r\nfull the relevant resolutions adopted by the General\r\nAssembly and Security Council regarding East Timor.\r\nThese resolutions reaffirm the need to apply, in the case of\r\nEast Timor, the essential principles and rules adopted by this\r\nOrganization on decolonization; those contained not only in\r\nthe Charter, but in the historic resolutions 1514 (XV) and\r\n1541 (XV) as well. The rejection of military conquest as the\r\nbasis for claiming territorial enlargement, the need to respect\r\nEast Timor’s territorial integrity and the right of its people\r\nto self-determination are clearly established in those\r\nresolutions.\r\nWe remain firmly committed to achieving, in a peaceful\r\nand negotiated manner, a just, comprehensive and\r\ninternationally acceptable settlement to this question. That\r\nsettlement must not fail to meet the standards of\r\ninternational law and must fully respect the legitimate rights\r\nof the East Timorese, who are those most directly concerned\r\nand who have been the principal victims of this painful and\r\nlong-protracted problem.\r\nI should especially like to applaud the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General - and those of his collaborators - under\r\nwhose auspices talks have been held with Indonesia aimed\r\nat settling this issue. We do recognize how very difficult\r\nthis task is as a result of the wide gap between the positions\r\nof the parties on the substance of the question, which is the\r\nconclusion of the process of the decolonization of the\r\nTerritory. Three rounds of discussions have already taken\r\nplace at the Ministerial level, and we are in the process of\r\nadopting a set of confidence-building measures in order to\r\nimprove the atmosphere of dialogue and to foster the\r\nadvancement of the process.\r\nAllow me to quote, in this context, a passage of the\r\nprogress report submitted, just a few days ago, by the\r\nSecretary-General to the General Assembly:\r\n\"Equally important and intrinsically linked to the\r\npeace process is the human rights situation in East\r\nTimor. The improvement of the conditions in East\r\nTimor is sine qua non to progress in the talks\".\r\n(A/48/418, para. 5)\r\nI am sorry to have to say that, unfortunately, the human\r\nrights situation prevailing in the territory continues to elicit\r\ncondemnation on the part of the international community.\r\nThe resolutions adopted this year by the United Nations\r\nCommission on Human Rights and by its Subcommission on\r\nPrevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities\r\nare a clear demonstration of this. We sincerely hope that\r\nsteps will be taken that will bring about a tangible and\r\ngenuine improvement of the situation in the territory and that\r\nthis can be monitored without obstruction. I therefore call\r\nupon all Governments and human rights organizations to\r\ncontinue to keep a close eye on the situation in East Timor.\r\nWe are witnessing events of great significance in other\r\nparts of the world. Allow me to emphasize those which\r\nmerit our particular attention.\r\nPortugal remains faithful to the construction of an\r\nenlarged and strengthened Europe. We are close, therefore,\r\nto the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and, guided\r\nby that objective, we propose to contribute through our\r\nparticipation in the framework of the European Community\r\nwith a view to enhancing dialogue as well as political and\r\neconomic cooperation. This approach will ensure peace,\r\nstability and economic well-being.\r\nIn this context of the joint responsibility of all actors on\r\nthe international scene, we should encourage the ongoing\r\npolitical and economic reforms in the States that have\r\nemerged from the collapse of the former Soviet Union aimed\r\nat a peaceful evolution towards democratic societies based\r\non the rule of law and fundamental human rights. We\r\nsupport their progressive integration into the international\r\neconomy, which will prevent the political division of the\r\npast from being replaced with a new economic gap.\r\nAllow me to salute at this point President Yeltsin for\r\nhis courage and determination to carry on without\r\ninterruption the process of political and economic reform\r\nthat is indispensable for the complete democratization and\r\ndevelopment of the Russian Federation.\r\nWe lend our unequivocal support to all the efforts made\r\nby the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(CSCE) and the United Nations - which constitute a good\r\ntest for cooperation between regional organizations and the\r\nUnited Nations - to reach peaceful settlements to the\r\ndisputes that have arisen on the territory of the former Soviet\r\nUnion.\r\nRegarding nuclear arms control and disarmament,\r\nPortugal considers the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 15\r\nNuclear Weapons to be an instrument of major importance,\r\nand looks forward to its indefinite extension at the 1995\r\nReview Conference. Portugal urges all the parties that have\r\nnot yet done so to ratify it, and reiterates the need for all the\r\nnuclear-weapon States that have emerged from the former\r\nSoviet Union to implement and comply with the obligations\r\nresulting from the START I and START II Treaties and the\r\nLisbon Protocol.\r\nAt this point, allow me to stress the importance my\r\nGovernment attaches to the work of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, to which my country has recently presented its\r\ncandidature for full membership.\r\nI wish to refer here to the current negotiations that are\r\nseeking to conclude the General Agreement on Tariffs and\r\nTrade talks. While we hope for their successful conclusion,\r\nwhich we consider to be fundamental for the world\r\neconomy, we also believe that the result should reflect a\r\nglobal and balanced solution based on an opening of markets\r\nand a reinforcement of the rules of international trade.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the\r\nGovernment of Israel and the leaders of the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization for the realism, lucidity, courage and\r\nalso imagination they displayed with the conclusion of the\r\nrecent agreement, which represents a historic step towards\r\nthe achievement of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\r\nfor the Middle East based upon the relevant resolutions of\r\nthe United Nations. The agreement will certainly lend a new\r\nand encouraging vitality to the peace process in both its\r\nbilateral and multilateral tracks, irreversibly consolidating the\r\nlatest developments.\r\nGeographical proximity and historic and cultural ties\r\njustify the genuine attention with which my country is\r\nfollowing the evolution of the situation in the Maghreb.\r\nPortugal has stressed, within the European Community and\r\nin other international forums, the importance of that region\r\nto security and stability in the Mediterranean. In this sense,\r\nthe declaration of the Heads of State and Government at the\r\nLisbon meeting of the Council of Europe set out a new\r\napproach to a political, economic, social and cultural\r\ndialogue between the European Community and the Maghreb.\r\nPortugal has centuries-old relations of friendship with\r\nLatin America. Our special relationship with Brazil cannot\r\nbe overemphasized. We are therefore in a position, in the\r\nspirit of the recent Ibero-American Summit in Salvador da\r\nBahia, to enhance dialogue and cooperation with this region.\r\nIn this respect, I should like to stress the importance we\r\nattach to an agenda for development in the advancement of\r\na constructive and effective dialogue aimed at identifying\r\nand exploring new forms of solidarity in encouraging\r\ninternational cooperation for development.\r\nIn respect of the activities of the European Community,\r\nwe have been striving to strengthen European ties with Latin\r\nAmerica, through the San José process and the Rio group,\r\nby encouraging the efforts - which have already made\r\nprogress possible - aimed at increasing respect for\r\ndemocratic institutions and human rights and developing new\r\nforms of economic integration.\r\nI should also like to mention the current negotiations on\r\nthe preservation of natural resources and the maintenance of\r\nenvironmental balance. The obligations of States go beyond\r\nthe mere signature of multilateral treaties. At stake is a\r\nlegacy to future generations of sufficient, conserved and\r\nrenewable resources to ensure their well-being.\r\nAll efforts in that direction deserve the commitment of\r\nthe international community as a whole, through the\r\nimplementation of policies of a continental or even global\r\nscope. The Rio Conference was merely a step on the long\r\nroad to convincing the world of the need to preserve the\r\nenvironment and to maintain the balance between the means\r\nof production and the human component without resorting to\r\ndestruction and waste.\r\nIt is now important to put into practice the decisions of\r\nthe Rio Conference in order to give expression to the\r\nmeasures decided on there. Portugal will not fail to do its\r\npart, in the full realization that only then shall we be able to\r\nbuild a future for coming generations.\r\nAt this point in its history, the United Nations is facing\r\nan unprecedented opportunity and, for the first time, can\r\nplay the role originally intended for it, without restriction, in\r\nthe resolution of conflicts and the maintenance of\r\ninternational stability and as the custodian of respect for\r\nhuman rights.\r\nWe are all committed to providing a positive\r\ncontribution to meeting this challenge. Portugal, for its part,\r\nwill do everything possible to achieve these ambitious goals.\r\nMr. SOLANA MADARIAGA (Spain) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I should like first of all, Mr. President, to\r\nconvey to you my warmest congratulations. Your election\r\nto the presidency of this Assembly is a clear\r\nacknowledgement of your personal qualities and diplomatic\r\nskills and is a tribute to your country, the Republic of\r\nGuyana. We are pleased that you were nominated as a\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncandidate by the Group of Latin American and Caribbean\r\nStates, with which my country has particularly close and\r\ncooperative relations.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to and greet warmly\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The United Nations needs his\r\nproven competence and political experience in order to face\r\nthe numerous challenges before us at the end of the century.\r\nYou may rest assured, Mr. Secretary-General, that in\r\ncarrying out your complex tasks you can count on the firm\r\ncooperation of the Spanish authorities.\r\nAllow me also to convey at this time to the\r\nGovernment and the people of India our deepest sympathy\r\nfor and solidarity with the victims of the earthquake that\r\nravaged that country yesterday.\r\nOver the last year the universality of the United Nations\r\nhas once again been enhanced by the admission of the Czech\r\nRepublic, Slovakia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Eritrea, Monaco and Andorra as new Members.\r\nI welcome them all, and most particularly Andorra, a\r\nneighbour of Spain with which we are linked by special ties\r\nof history, culture and deep friendship.\r\nA few days ago Belgium’s Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the European Community and its\r\nmember States, set forth our common points of view in this\r\ngeneral debate. On behalf of the Spanish delegation, I shall\r\nmention some issues that I think deserve special attention.\r\nA year ago, when I addressed this Assembly for the\r\nfirst time, I referred, as did many other speakers, to the\r\nfundamental changes that had taken place in the world since\r\nthe middle of the last decade. It is the Spanish\r\nGovernment’s firm conviction that those changes have led to\r\nthe advent of a new era. The United Nations has a great\r\nopportunity to play an effective, central role in harmonizing\r\nworld-wide the efforts of the international community in\r\norder to achieve the common purposes embodied in the Charter.\r\nThus, it seems that the time has come to strengthen our\r\nOrganization by providing it with the necessary human and\r\nmaterial resources to enable it to carry out its goals. We\r\nmust also think about the measures necessary for a possible\r\nrevision of the Charter.\r\nA review of the Security Council is an item on our\r\nagenda, and this needs to be approached in a constructive\r\nspirit and with the aim of increasing its representativeness\r\nand ensuring that its actions be not only fast but also\r\neffective. Such a review should be based on the criteria\r\nestablished in Article 23 of the Charter, that is to say, taking\r\ninto account the contribution of Member States to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to the\r\nother purposes of the Organization, and also to equitable\r\ngeographical distribution.\r\nWe believe that the time has come for a moderate\r\nincrease in the membership of the Council so as to reflect\r\nthe increase in the number of Members of the Organization\r\nsince 1963, when, for the first time, it was decided to\r\nexpand the Council’s membership.\r\nWe also deem it appropriate to consider the creation of\r\nnew categories: one that would enable certain States to\r\nbecome permanent members without the right of veto, and\r\nanother that would allow more frequent non-permanent\r\nmembership in the Council to certain States with weight and\r\ninfluence in international relations that have the capacity and\r\npolitical will to contribute significantly to the fulfilment of\r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations. All this\r\nwould undoubtedly serve to put our Organization in a better\r\nposition to face the challenges of maintaining peace and\r\ninternational security.\r\nIn this context, it is also necessary to make reforms in\r\norder to deal with the changing nature of the tasks assigned\r\nto the peace operations established by the Security Council.\r\nThe traditional concept of peace-keeping operations,\r\nembracing monitoring of cease-fire agreements, interposition\r\nbetween adversarial forces and the establishment of\r\nconfidence-building measures - all by primarily military\r\nmeans - has been expanded, increasingly encompassing new,\r\nnon-military aspects. These new tasks range from\r\nhumanitarian assistance to nation-building, and include the\r\nmonitoring of elections and of the observance of human\r\nrights. Nearly 100,000 men and women from all over the\r\nworld are currently serving in the framework of these\r\nincreasingly complex and demanding operations.\r\nThe United Nations has made a commendable effort to\r\nadapt the structure and functioning of peace operations to the\r\nnew exigencies. We should pursue our efforts in this\r\ndirection, as we are convinced that it is always preferable to\r\nsolve a conflict under the aegis of the United Nations than\r\nthrough the unilateral action of a Power or group of Powers\r\noutside the framework of the Organization.\r\nHere I should like to draw the Assembly’s attention to\r\nsome relevant questions regarding the proper functioning of\r\npeace operations and to offer some ideas and suggestions\r\naimed at enhancing their performance and effectiveness.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 17\r\nWhen establishing a peace operation, the Security\r\nCouncil should pay the utmost attention to defining\r\naccurately its mandate. The Council should also receive\r\nperiodic information on the development of the operation.\r\nConsultation mechanisms should be established with those\r\nStates that have a special interest, because of their\r\ninvolvement in the operation or their troop contributions.\r\nSpecial attention should also be given to questions of\r\nsafety. Acts of violence against the Blue Helmets have\r\nincreased alarmingly because of the growing complexity and\r\nrisks of the operations. The issue of safety should be\r\nconsidered most seriously. In this regard we have examined\r\nwith the greatest interest the Secretary-General’s report to\r\nthe Security Council and the recommendations of the Special\r\nCommittee on Peace-keeping Operations. We believe that\r\nthe use of force against United Nations personnel must be\r\nregarded as unacceptable interference in the exercise of the\r\nresponsibilities entrusted to the Security Council by the\r\nCharter. When such acts occur, the Council should take\r\nappropriate measures, the first of which should be to hold\r\nresponsible the perpetrators of the acts.\r\nThe Spanish Government considers it imperative that\r\nthe appropriate financial resources be made available to the\r\nUnited Nations in timely fashion to meet the cost of these\r\noperations. We all share the responsibility for ensuring a\r\nsound financial and administrative basis for peace operations.\r\nBefore a new operation is established, an estimate of its\r\nfinancial implications should be presented to the Council.\r\nA the same time, the task assigned to the Security\r\nCouncil in terms of peace-keeping and peace enforcement\r\nshould not lead us to forget the competence of the General\r\nAssembly on budgetary questions and in the field of\r\npreventive diplomacy, especially peace-building. With the\r\ncooperation of United Nations operational activities, the\r\nGeneral Assembly must play an important role in this overall\r\napproach to international security, as is referred to by the\r\nSecretary-General in his \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nNeither should the Secretariat be overlooked. Its\r\nstructure and logistical capacity for managing peace\r\noperations need to be reviewed and expanded. We applaud\r\nthe Secretary-General’s efforts in this respect.\r\nAware of the crucial importance taken on by peace\r\noperations, Spain - which has participated and continues to\r\nparticipate through a large number of military and civilian\r\nobservers in various operations, particularly in Central\r\nAmerica and southern Africa - decided a year ago to send a\r\nmilitary contingent of about 1,000 soldiers to Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina as part of the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR).\r\nWithin the framework of the increasingly necessary\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations, my country sent observers to help in\r\nmonitoring compliance with the sanctions imposed against\r\nSerbia and Montenegro and is maintaining naval units in the\r\nAdriatic. Spanish personnel also take part in the observer\r\nmissions of the European community and the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\r\nThe people and the Government of Spain are proud of\r\nthe work being done by our forces and observers. I wish\r\nto take this opportunity to pay tribute to those who have\r\ngiven their blood and their lives while serving in these\r\npeaceful humanitarian missions of the Organization.\r\nSince the beginning of the terrible conflict in the former\r\nYugoslavia the Spanish people and Government have done\r\ntheir best to alleviate the suffering of the population and\r\nhave contributed, within the framework of the Security\r\nCouncil and the International Conference on the Former\r\nYugoslavia, to the development of a political process aimed\r\nat achieving a peaceful solution acceptable to all parties.\r\nWe have all been appalled by the cruelty of that war and\r\nfrustrated by the endless negotiations.\r\nIt is only fitting to acknowledge the splendid work\r\naccomplished, under extremely difficult circumstances, by\r\nthe United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). We\r\nwould also express gratitude for the skill and dedication of\r\nthe co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the\r\nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.\r\nProvided they can rely on the parties’ basic goodwill and\r\ncapacity for compromise, their efforts should lead to an\r\nagreement before this coming winter brings with it a\r\ndreadful human catastrophe. If the hoped for agreement is\r\nreached, the international community and the Organization\r\nwill then be faced with a new challenge, that of guaranteeing\r\nimplementation of the peace agreement through the\r\nestablishment of a peace-keeping operation under the\r\nauspices and authority of the United Nations. Spain would\r\nbe prepared to contribute to such a force.\r\nThis year the Security Council decided to establish an\r\nInternational Tribunal to bring to trial those charged with\r\nserious violations of international humanitarian law\r\ncommitted in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. We\r\nbelieve that this crucial step will also encourage at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly the speedy completion of\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nwork leading to the establishment of a permanent\r\ninternational criminal tribunal with universal jurisdiction.\r\nIn the past few months important developments have\r\ntaken place in various other parts of the world.\r\nMy Government is following with anxiety and hope\r\nthe recent events in Russia - with anxiety, because at one\r\ntime it appeared that the internal stability of that country\r\nand, therefore, of Europe and the rest of the world, was in\r\njeopardy, but also with hope that the Russian people\r\nthemselves will become the masters of their own destiny.\r\nWe are concerned about the worsening conflict in\r\nAbkhazia and the continued confrontation in Nagorny-\r\nKarabakh between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. We appeal\r\nto the wisdom and capacity for dialogue of all the parties\r\ninvolved and reiterate our support for the peace efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE).\r\nIn Angola the process of restoring democratic normality\r\nand coexistence has been seriously hampered by UNITA’s\r\nrefusal to accept the outcome of free and fair elections, thus\r\npreventing the implementation of the Bicesse Accords. This\r\nhas compelled the Security Council to impose sanctions on\r\nUNITA in the hope that its leadership will reconsider its\r\nattitude and begin to cooperate in good faith to put an end\r\nto a conflict of catastrophic human proportions.\r\nWe wish to recall that a number of the problems arising\r\nfrom the war between Iraq and Kuwait are still unresolved,\r\namong them the exchange of prisoners and the return of\r\nstolen assets by the invader. The fact that Iraq has not yet\r\nrecognized either the existence of Kuwait as a sovereign\r\nState, Member of the United Nations, the demarcation of the\r\nborder between the two countries, which was recently\r\nconfirmed by the Security Council, constitutes a serious\r\nobstacle to peace.\r\nThe persistence of those and other conflicts should not\r\nmake us forget the progress achieved in the solution of\r\nmany others.\r\nHere we would especially mention the success achieved\r\nin Cambodia through the United Nations Transitional\r\nAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC), with the holding last May\r\nof elections for a Constituent Assembly, elections that paved\r\nthe way to national unity and reconciliation.\r\nIn the Middle East, the serious obstacles that were\r\nthreatening to scuttle the peace process launched two years\r\nago in Madrid have been overcome. The mutual recognition\r\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\n(PLO), along with the signing in Washington on 13\r\nSeptember of an Agreement on the establishment of an\r\nautonomous Palestinian regime in Jericho and Gaza, is a\r\ndevelopment of far-reaching significance. Spain welcomes\r\nthis fundamental step in the tortured history of the Middle\r\nEast and is prepared, together with other countries, to\r\nmaintain its political and economic support in order to\r\nensure that the Agreement between the Palestinians and\r\nIsraelis becomes effective. We are aware that the process is\r\nfraught with difficulties, but we believe that they can be\r\nsurmounted with the same courage and imagination already\r\ndisplayed in achieving the recent agreements, and with the\r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nIn Africa, new developments have taken place, although\r\nnot without some delay and difficulties. In Mozambique we\r\nhave witnessed the implementation of the General Peace\r\nAgreement, with the invaluable cooperation of the United\r\nNations Operation in Mozambique (UNOMOZ). In Somalia,\r\nthe Security Council has given the United Nations Operation\r\nin Somalia (UNOSOM II) one of the broadest mandates ever\r\nconferred upon a United Nations operation. It cannot be\r\ndenied that problems of internal adjustment have been\r\ncaused by the very novelty and magnitude of the tasks\r\nentrusted to UNOSOM II, and they will have to taken into\r\naccount in future peace-keeping operations. Nevertheless,\r\nthe Operation’s contribution has been vital in reducing the\r\nconsequences of a catastrophe caused by natural disasters\r\nand armed rivalries that have claimed hundreds of thousands\r\nof victims.\r\nTurning to the question of Western Sahara, I wish to\r\nexpress Spain’s full support for the efforts being made by\r\nthe Secretary-General and his Special Representative to find\r\na solution to the outstanding problems that will make\r\npossible the holding of a free and fair referendum on self-\r\ndetermination. That referendum will pave the way for the\r\nclimate of understanding and cooperation that is necessary\r\nto deal with the challenges in the region. My country\r\nresolutely supports the process of integration in the North of\r\nAfrica and the development of stronger links between\r\nEurope and the Maghreb.\r\nWe also welcome the progress made in the transitional\r\nprocess in South Africa, although we regret the fact that\r\nviolence still holds sway in certain areas. The progress\r\nmade in the drafting of a Constitution and the prompt\r\nestablishment of the Transitional Executive Council are the\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 19\r\nbest possible foundations for the holding of general elections\r\nin 1994 to prepare the way for a truly representative\r\nParliament and a democratic South Africa that will be able\r\nto find its true place in the Organization and in the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn Latin America, a number of recent events deserve\r\nspecial consideration.\r\nI should mention first the process of consolidation of\r\ndemocracy through the free election of civilian Presidents\r\nand Parliaments in nearly the whole of the continent. That\r\nfact, enhanced by a number of forums such as the Rio\r\nGroup, the Central American Summits or the Ibero-\r\nAmerican Summits, has reversed attempts to violate the\r\nlegitimacy of the democratic process.\r\nLatin America continues to place special emphasis on\r\nthe use of negotiation, mediation and conciliation in solving\r\nits conflicts, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VI\r\nof the Charter.\r\nRespect for international law and democracy are the\r\nprinciples that have guided and will continue to guide the\r\nactivities of the international community aimed at restoring\r\ndemocratic legality in Haiti. Those principles have also\r\ninspired the decisive agreements with regard to the peace\r\nprocess in El Salvador, where we hope the recommendations\r\nof the Ad Hoc Commission and the Commission on the\r\nTruth will be implemented. Finally, those same principles\r\nwill be the basis for reconciliation and development in\r\nNicaragua and Guatemala.\r\nOnce again this year I have to mention a matter that, as\r\nthe Assembly knows, is of fundamental importance to Spain,\r\nnamely, the decolonization of Gibraltar. I wish to reiterate\r\nmy Government’s firm decision to continue the process of\r\nnegotiation with the United Kingdom in a constructive spirit\r\nand on the basis of the Brussels Declaration of 27 November\r\n1984. Those negotiations should duly take into account the\r\nlegitimate interests of the population, but be based on the\r\ndoctrine established by the General Assembly that the\r\ndecolonization of Gibraltar is not a case of self-\r\ndetermination but of the restoration of the territorial integrity\r\nof Spain. The Spanish Government firmly hopes that those\r\nnegotiations will finally eliminate this anachronism.\r\nIn the field of disarmament new challenges have\r\nemerged, such as the need to put an end to the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction. Now, more than ever, we\r\nneed to redouble our efforts to move beyond a period of\r\nconfrontation that belongs to the past.\r\nThere is a pressing need to strengthen the multilateral\r\nnegotiating forums to enable them to face the new\r\nchallenges efficiently. In this respect, my country considers\r\nthat priority should be given to enlarging the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, on the basis of a consensus that will enable\r\ncountries like Spain, which have been participating actively\r\nin its work for a long time, to become members.\r\nThere is a clear link between international peace and\r\nsecurity on the one hand and economic and social\r\ndevelopment on the other. In this new era, when the United\r\nNations is renewing its efforts to maintain international\r\npeace and security, we must note the persistence of deep\r\ndisparities and serious economic and social problems\r\nbesetting all countries, in particular the developing countries.\r\nTo confront these challenges, the reform of the United\r\nNations should extend to the Organization’s economic and\r\nsocial machinery. The reforms, which have already begun,\r\nshould be aimed at achieving more effective functioning and\r\nat using available resources more rationally to meet the\r\nneeds of developing countries.\r\nIn that context, let me mention the convening of the\r\nfirst session of the Commission on Sustainable Development.\r\nWe hope its work will maintain and even intensify the great\r\nmomentum generated by the Rio Summit on environment\r\nand development and lead to the speedy implementation of\r\nthe commitments made there in Agenda 21.\r\nBut it is not enough to repair and fine-tune the\r\nmachinery we intend to use to deal with the challenges of\r\ndevelopment. We need clear guidelines by which to steer it\r\nunerringly towards the wide range of current needs, in\r\nparticular those of the developing countries. Hence, we look\r\nforward with great interest to the Secretary-General’s\r\n\"Agenda for Development\"; in conjunction with \"An Agenda\r\nfor Peace\", this will supplement the guidelines for action by\r\nthe international community with respect to the indivisible\r\nequation of world peace and economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn that context, I want to recall that the third\r\nIbero-American Summit, held at Salvador de Bahía, Brazil,\r\nlast July, considered \"An agenda for development\", with the\r\nemphasis on social development. The conclusions adopted\r\nby the Heads of State or Government of the 21 participating\r\ncountries were submitted to the Secretary-General as a\r\ncontribution to the preparation of his own \"Agenda for\r\nDevelopment\".\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe final document of that Summit stressed the\r\ngrowing interrelationship among the concepts of\r\ndevelopment, democracy and human rights. It drew\r\nattention to the priority that should be given to the fight\r\nagainst poverty both on the governmental level and when\r\nallocating resources and creating machinery for international\r\ncooperation. Our starting-point should be to promote\r\nintegrated economic and social development, bearing in mind\r\nthe three priorities the Secretary-General set out at the last\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council: redistribution,\r\nintegration and protection.\r\nThe structure of and developments in the world\r\npopulation give rise to grave uncertainties about their\r\nconsequences and about the aspirations of developing\r\ncountries to attain sustainable development. These and other\r\nimportant issues such as large-scale migration, improving the\r\nmachinery for cooperation, and managing resources for that\r\npurpose will be discussed at the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development to be held next year at Cairo.\r\nWe hope that Conference will mark a significant step\r\ntowards the solution of these questions by addressing\r\ntogether the issues of population, economic growth and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe Spanish Government considers that there is also an\r\nurgent need to integrate women into the development\r\nprocess, eliminate discrimination against women and ensure\r\ntheir full participation in the economic, social, cultural, civic\r\nand political spheres. We trust that this commitment will be\r\nrenewed and buttressed by the international community at\r\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held in\r\nBeijing in 1995.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development, the\r\nconvening of which my country strongly supported from the\r\noutset, is to be held at Copenhagen in 1995. It will give a\r\npolitical impetus to improving the living conditions of the\r\nmost disadvantaged sectors of our populations. It will help\r\npromote their social integration and the creation of a concept\r\nof social development taking into account the relationship\r\nbetween peace and well-being, while aiming to reduce\r\npoverty and increase employment.\r\nYear after year from this rostrum we emphasize our\r\nfirm intention to build a better world in which the protection\r\nand promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\nwill become real and effective. Unfortunately, year after\r\nyear we are forced to observe that, despite all our efforts, the\r\npractices that endanger human life, freedom and security\r\npersist. It is therefore no longer enough to state our\r\nreadiness to step up our efforts; we must now move, in\r\nsolidarity, to action.\r\nIn that respect, the outcome of the Vienna Conference\r\non human rights gives us an excellent opportunity to work\r\nsteadfastly towards our common goal. We now have a set\r\nof universal rules, universally accepted; we must now insist\r\non their obligatory application. There can be no democracy\r\nwithout respect for human rights, and without democracy\r\nthere cannot be the harmonious, balanced and lasting\r\ndevelopment to which we all aspire.\r\nFor that reason, it is of high importance that we\r\nproceed expeditiously to implement the Vienna\r\ncommitments, in particular the programme of action. In the\r\nview of the Spanish Government there are two key issues\r\nthe resolution of which could lead to unprecedented progress\r\nin this area. First, we must agree on the establishment of\r\nthe office of a high commissioner for human rights; and\r\nsecondly, we must provide the United Nations Centre for\r\nHuman Rights with the resources it needs to carry out its\r\nmandate fully.\r\nIn my statement today I have tried to address the most\r\npressing challenges facing the Organization, challenges\r\ninherent in the increasingly free but increasingly uncertain\r\nworld in which we live. I have also advanced proposals for\r\nthe reform of the Organization aimed at adapting it to the\r\nnew circumstances.\r\nIt is difficult but necessary that we focus both on the\r\nnew problems and on the reform of the Organization. Our\r\nability to do this will determine whether the United Nations\r\ncan increasingly serve as the proper forum for resolving\r\nworld problems.\r\nSheikh AL-SABAH (Kuwait) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): On behalf of Kuwait, it gives me pleasure to\r\nconvey to Ambassador Insanally our sincere congratulations\r\non his unanimous election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I take this opportunity\r\nto assure him of the support and cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of Kuwait in recognition of the close ties that\r\nexist between our two countries. His ability and skill give\r\nus confidence that our deliberation under his leadership will\r\nbe fruitful.\r\nI am pleased also to pay a tribute to his predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Bulgaria, for his able and effective stewardship of\r\nthe General Assembly at its previous session.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 21\r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Kuwait,\r\nI wish to extend deepest sympathy and condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of India with respect to the\r\ntragedy resulting from the earthquake in that country, which\r\nclaimed thousands of innocent victims.\r\nKuwait has been following the impressive role of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, in developing new\r\nmodalities of work for the United Nations that are more in\r\nline with the sweeping developments, events and changes\r\nthat are taking place in the world. We cannot but put on\r\nrecord our appreciation of the Secretary-General’s tireless\r\nefforts and creativity in restructuring and streamlining the\r\nworld Organization to reflect in a more meaningful manner\r\nthe realities of the new world situation. He deserves special\r\ncredit for his promotion of the concept of preventive\r\ndiplomacy.\r\nKuwait takes pride in its backing of the United Nations\r\nand we do support the new approach it pursues despite the\r\nvarious difficulties it faces and the accusations levelled at it.\r\nThe United Nations, at the threshold of its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, needs from us every material and moral support\r\neach and every Member can extend to it. On the other hand,\r\nthe Organization itself should enhance its effectiveness,\r\nstreamline its structure and revitalize its organs, especially\r\nthe Security Council. The Council should reflect more\r\nclosely the new realities of today’s world. It should be more\r\ncapable of making and preserving peace and more forcefully\r\nfirm in implementing its resolutions in consonance with the\r\nprovisions of the Charter.\r\nThe United Nations today reflects new world realities,\r\nas shown by the recent increase in its membership. Kuwait\r\nwelcomes the accession to United Nations membership by\r\nEritrea, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Monaco,\r\nAndorra and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\r\nand trusts that their accession to the Organization’s\r\nmembership will consolidate further the efficacy and\r\nuniversality of multilateralism.\r\nWith the end of the cold war and the effectual\r\nparticipation by the United Nations in resolving many\r\ninternational problems, the world today is moving steadily\r\ntowards the realization of the principle of interdependence\r\nand mutual cooperation between members of the\r\ninternational community. The demise of bipolarity and the\r\ndisappearance of the barriers that used to separate peoples,\r\ntogether with closer contacts through mass communication\r\nmade available by the technological revolution, have made\r\nit possible for every individual to watch world events as they\r\nunfold. Thus peoples are now able to react to and interact\r\nwith global issues in an unprecedented manner. A direct\r\noutcome of all that is the constant expansion of the web of\r\ninterrelated interests, so that regional security has become an\r\ninseparable part of global security. Economic and social\r\ndevelopment issues have now acquired a high priority among\r\nthe concerns of the international community.\r\nWhile we in Kuwait support this new tendency, we\r\nmust stress that movement in the new direction should be\r\nhumane in concept, civilized in ways and means, pragmatic\r\nin modalities and realistic in aims. We also stress that the\r\nright of both the individual and the community to\r\ndevelopment should be accorded top priority among\r\ninternational concerns. In this context, we consider that the\r\nfirst and foremost human right is the right to secure essential\r\nnecessities of living. Social and economic development at\r\nvarious levels is a close second. Kuwait believes that\r\ndevelopment should be addressed collectively and that is the\r\nmost effective way of ensuring the availability of its\r\nessential ingredients, so that no region or group of nations\r\nshould monopolize world resources at the expense of whole\r\ncontinents which remain hostage to the cycle of want and\r\npoverty.\r\nWe view with satisfaction the new approach of dealing\r\ncollectively with hotbeds of tension, as envisioned by the\r\nCharter. Here we have in mind the practical and effective\r\napplication of the concept of collective security in the\r\ncontext of which regional conflicts are viewed as direct\r\nthreats to world peace and stability and not as mere threats\r\nto regional security. Therefore we demand that any conflict\r\nshould be dealt with firmly and expeditiously in order to\r\navoid its worsening, opening the door and allowing terrorism\r\nto fly in the face of international legality and flout the new\r\napproach.\r\nIt is in keeping with this conviction that Kuwait, despite\r\nits difficult circumstances, participates in the United Nations\r\nhumanitarian operations in Somalia, our sister country. Such\r\nparticipation bespeaks our commitment to the new United\r\nNations approach and our support for putting it into practice.\r\nKuwait considers that the international presence in Somalia\r\nis indispensable if the Somali people are to be saved from\r\ndestruction and chaos and if Somalia itself is to survive as\r\nan independent country. Indeed, the United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations, which now total 17, as stated by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/48/1), require from us all full material\r\nsupport, practical participation and political backing.\r\nAccordingly, the Government of Kuwait announces from this\r\npodium that it will voluntarily bear two thirds of the costs of\r\nthe United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\n(UNIKOM). This is to demonstrate our firm belief in the\r\ntrue role of UNIKOM in safeguarding the security and peace\r\nin our region. It represents also a consolidation of the\r\nconcept of collective security and the United Nations role\r\ntherein.\r\nKuwait believes that the most important underpinnings\r\nof the new world approach are: compliance with established\r\nnorms of conduct in international relations; respect for the\r\nprinciples of international law; rejection of interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of other States; rejection of seeking gains\r\nand concessions at the expense of neighbouring countries;\r\nthe resolution of problems by dialogue rather than by force;\r\nand the renunciation of terrorism as a means of revenge.\r\nThe Iraqi regime invaded and occupied the State of\r\nKuwait. However, the adamant international will embodied\r\nby the United Nations helped liberate Kuwait in a historic\r\nact that led to a clean and tidy elimination of that horrendous\r\ncrime. Subsequently, Iraq accepted the consequences of its\r\ncrime as set out in Security Council resolution 687 (1991)\r\nwhich contains the provisions of fair and binding solutions\r\nfor the false Iraqi claims regarding Kuwait. It also outlines\r\nthe conditions for dealing with the consequences and\r\nunderlying reasons of the Iraqi invasion. The quintessence\r\nof resolution 687, which was accepted unconditionally by\r\nIraq, is the reaffirmation of the sovereignty and\r\nindependence of Kuwait. It also called for the utilization of\r\nUnited Nations technical assistance in the demarcation of\r\nboundaries between Kuwait and Iraq on the basis of the\r\ndocuments exchanged between the two countries in\r\nOctober 1963. In implementation of the provisions of the\r\nsaid resolution, the United Nations set up a Boundary\r\nDemarcation Commission which successfully completed its\r\nwork last May and has issued its final report which contains\r\nthe definitive map of land and maritime boundaries between\r\nKuwait and Iraq (document S/25811).\r\nKuwait commends the technical Boundary Demarcation\r\nCommission and pays tribute to its members for their\r\nimpartiality, dedication and patience, especially in the face\r\nof Iraqi accusations and provocations. Kuwait also pays\r\ntribute to the Security Council for adopting two historic\r\nresolutions this year. The first, resolution 806 (1993),\r\nextended the terms of reference of UNIKOM into a\r\npeace-keeping operation with full powers to prevent Iraqi\r\nraids into Kuwait and to put an end to riots instigated by the\r\nIraqi regime. Resolution 833 (1993), unanimously adopted\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter, reaffirms the commitment\r\nof the Security Council to guarantee the inviolability of the\r\ninternational boundary as demarcated by the United Nations\r\ntechnical commission and to consider that boundary as final\r\nand inviolable. By so doing, the Security Council has put an\r\nend to an amorphous situation which had lasted for far too\r\nlong and which Iraq exploited in a bid to secure territorial\r\nexpansion, to exercise regional hegemony, and to gain\r\npolitical, strategic and material concessions at the expense of\r\nKuwait and the other Gulf States. The demarcation of the\r\nboundary between Kuwait and Iraq is a major contribution\r\nby the international community to the elimination of a\r\nvolatile hotbed of regional tension which the Iraqi regime\r\nused to exploit in creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and\r\nmistrust and which culminated in its vicious invasion of the\r\nState of Kuwait.\r\nKuwait responded positively to the Secretary- General’s\r\nacceptance of the outcome of the border demarcation\r\nprocess. In our response, we also reaffirmed our sincere\r\ncooperation with the United Nations despite the fact that\r\nKuwait had voted against some Commission decisions which\r\ndenied Kuwait its rights in Khowr Zhobeir. Iraq, for its part,\r\nresponded with two letters to the Secretary-General. The\r\nfirst in May 1992, following the demarcation of the land\r\nboundary, and the second in June 1993 following the\r\ndemarcation of the maritime boundary. Both letters\r\nreiterated previous Iraqi claims to what it calls its historical\r\nrights. Iraq also rejected the demarcation results and\r\nchallenged the integrity of the United Nations technical\r\nCommission and the validity of its procedures and work.\r\nThis prompted the Security Council to reprimand Iraq\r\nstrongly in a presidential statement which it issued on\r\n28 June 1993 and in which it rejected the contents of the\r\naforesaid Iraqi letters and reminded Iraq of its obligations\r\nunder resolution 687 (1991).\r\nIraq has unconditionally accepted resolution 687 (1991)\r\nin all its provisions and in so doing has undertaken legal,\r\npolitical and moral obligations on which it cannot renege,\r\nnor can it fail to abide by the consequences of such\r\nobligations because the functions of the technical\r\nCommission were not to the liking of its representative on\r\nthe Commission, who had participated fully, for a whole\r\nyear, in its work and deliberations and then chose to\r\nwithdraw from the Commission when he found himself\r\nunable to produce substantive documents corroborating\r\nIraq’s claims, despite the fact that the Commission pressed\r\nhim to do so. The stance of the Iraqi regime constitutes a\r\nrebellion against Security Council resolutions in defiance of\r\nthe will of the Council and the international community.\r\nThis represents an egregious departure from the current\r\nglobal mainstream and warrants firm international resolve to\r\nreject the Iraqi regime’s practices in both form and\r\nsubstance.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 23\r\nI find it necessary now to emphasize in no uncertain\r\nterms that the Iraqi regime remains in its philosophy,\r\nbehaviour, thinking and nature a threat to regional and global\r\npeace and security. It persists in its aggressiveness while it\r\nthumbs its nose at the world community, which continues to\r\nreject and isolate it with sanctions. Kuwait has confidence\r\nin the wisdom of the Security Council and the ability of its\r\nmembers to fulfil their mandate. We trust that they are keen\r\nto ensure their collective commitment to the Security\r\nCouncil resolutions and thus compel the Iraqi regime to\r\nrecognize that it has no option but to begin the complete and\r\ndocumented implementation of all those resolutions to the\r\nletter. The Iraqi regime should be made to understand that\r\nits desperate endeavours to have the sanctions lifted will be\r\ntotally futile unless and until it clearly and legally complies\r\nwith the boundary demarcation decisions as set forth in the\r\nrelevant Council resolutions, especially resolutions 773\r\n(1992) and 833 (1993). The Iraqi regime must also meet\r\nother basic requirements, such as desisting from the false\r\nclaims made by its official information apparatus which\r\ncontinues to describe Kuwait as part of Iraq and to make\r\nother false claims to so-called historical rights. The\r\npersistence of and increase in such falsehoods, which\r\nemanate from ranking officials of that regime, is a reversal\r\nof and retreat from acceptance of the essence of resolution\r\n687 (1991), which represents Iraq’s commitment to respect\r\nKuwait’s sovereignty, independence and international\r\nborders. We have submitted regular reports to the Security\r\nCouncil containing complete verbatim excerpts of the claims\r\nmade by senior Iraqi officials and the official Iraqi media.\r\nWe call upon all Member States of the United Nations\r\nto welcome the relevant Security Council resolutions on the\r\nborder demarcation and the inviolability of boundaries as\r\nessential components of the regional security structure. We\r\nalso expect Member States to demand that the Iraqi regime\r\nrespect all relevant resolutions and link the lifting of\r\nsanctions with its implementation of all Security Council\r\nresolutions, particularly those regarding the boundary\r\ndemarcation and the release of prisoners.\r\nIn this context, I should like to recall that the\r\nCooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC)\r\nissued at its last March session a statement welcoming the\r\ndemarcation of the boundary between Kuwait and Iraq. The\r\nGCC also underscored the demarcation as an underpinning\r\nof regional security. Furthermore, the Damascus Declaration\r\nStates, which include the six GCC countries together with\r\nEgypt and Syria, issued a statement last June supporting the\r\ndemarcation and welcoming the measures taken by the\r\nSecurity Council as positive contributions to stability and\r\nsecurity at both the regional and international levels.\r\nIraq’s procrastination in implementing the Security\r\nCouncil resolutions is not limited to the boundary\r\ndemarcation but extends to a purely humanitarian issue: the\r\nrelease of all prisoners, hostages and detainees of Kuwaiti\r\nand third country nationals. Those hostages and prisoners\r\nhave been languishing in Iraqi prisons and detention camps\r\nfor some three years now. We trust and hope that the\r\ninternational community will bring pressure to bear on the\r\nIraqi regime to release every one of those innocent men,\r\nwomen and children. Their plight is a stark violation of all\r\nthe values and concepts associated with the issue of human\r\nrights. It is also a case that represents a rejection of the new\r\nglobal approach, which we believe all here are keen to\r\npromote with a view to safeguarding human rights in the\r\nworld.\r\nKuwait has explored all possible avenues, using all\r\navailable Arab, Islamic and international channels to\r\npersuade the Iraqi regime to comply with the norms of\r\ninternational law, especially its commitments under the\r\nGeneva Conventions. To date, the Iraqi regime has made no\r\npositive response to the efforts made by the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on behalf of those\r\npersons. Most recently, it boycotted a meeting organized by\r\nthe ICRC in Geneva last month to discuss the latest\r\ndevelopments of this important and urgent humanitarian\r\nmatter. The people of Kuwait will feel no relief and enjoy\r\nno peace of mind until the very last prisoner is returned to\r\nhis or her family and homeland.\r\nIraq has also failed to fulfil its obligation to return the\r\nremainder of Kuwaiti property belonging to the private and\r\npublic sectors in our country. Furthermore, it has neither\r\nimplemented Security Council resolutions 707 (1991) and\r\n715 (1991), nor has it desisted from oppressing and\r\nsuppressing its own population in the northern and the\r\nsouthern regions of the country. It continues to resort to acts\r\nof terrorism. We in Kuwait share the Iraqi people’s pain\r\nand suffering by virtue of the brotherhood between our two\r\npeoples and our everlasting neighbourhood. It is with\r\nparticular concern that we see the humiliation of the Iraqi\r\npeople as the Iraqi regime pursues its atrocities with total\r\ndisregard for the plight of the Iraqi people and its future.\r\nThe Iraqi regime has stubbornly rejected the mechanism\r\nprovided to alleviate the suffering and hardships of the Iraqi\r\npeople by failing to implement Security Council resolutions\r\n706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Indeed, responsibility for the\r\nplight of the Iraqi people lies squarely on the regime itself,\r\nwhich must be held accountable for all the dire\r\nconsequences of its atrocities.\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nKuwait firmly believes that security in the Gulf region\r\nis part and parcel of world security. Hence, the international\r\ncommunity is responsible for ensuring respect for the\r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States\r\nthat fall prey to aggression. Support for States that fall\r\nvictim to aggression should also be provided by the world\r\ncommunity when a conflict breaks out. The consolidation of\r\nregional security requires confidence-building among all\r\ncountries in the region as a basic premise for attaining that\r\ncommon goal. Here, I should like to underline the close ties\r\nand complete trust that exist among GCC States. Their\r\ncooperation is a substantial contribution to the stability and\r\nsecurity of the region. Facts on the ground attest to our\r\ncommon endeavours.\r\nKuwait is keen to improve its relations with the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran on the basis of the principles of\r\ngood-neighbourliness, non-interference in the internal affairs\r\nof each other and respect for sovereignty as specified by the\r\nGulf Cooperation Council Supreme Council. Having said\r\nthat, Kuwait would like to emphasize the sovereignty of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates over its three islands - Abu Mousa,\r\nLesser Tonb and Greater Tonb. Furthermore, Kuwait wishes\r\nto put on record its absolute support for all the peaceful\r\nmeasures and means to which the United Arab Emirates\r\nresorts in order to regain sovereignty over its islands.\r\nKuwait remains hopeful that dialogue will eventually clear\r\naway all the outstanding matters between the two countries.\r\nWith that aim in view, Kuwait calls upon the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran to commit itself to resolving this dispute on\r\nthe basis of international law and treaties and to ending it by\r\npeaceful means.\r\nIn the context of the developments that are taking place\r\nwith regard to the Middle East peace process, Kuwait\r\nwelcomes the signing of the accord between the people of\r\nPalestine and Israel to exercise their right to self-\r\ndetermination, to free their territory from occupation and to\r\nbuild their own national institutions. In keeping with\r\nKuwait’s support for every effort made and every avenue\r\nchosen by the Palestinian people to further their cause, the\r\nKuwaiti Council of Ministers has issued a statement in\r\nwhich it welcomed this first step towards the full\r\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nKuwait views this accord as a first step towards the\r\ncreation of a framework to deal with many details - a\r\nprocess that will require enormous effort and patience on the\r\npart of the parties directly involved if a successful\r\nconclusion is to be ensured. The accord has indeed ushered\r\nin a totally new chapter in the history of the Middle East\r\nand the question of Palestine. We hope that, in the new era,\r\nnegotiation will replace conflict; dialogue will supersede\r\nconfrontation; and that disputes will be resolved under the\r\nrule of international law instead of by force of arms, in\r\nconsonance with the developing new approach. However,\r\nthe litmus test will be in the steps that will follow and in the\r\nachievements that will be made on the other Arab fronts. In\r\nthe final analysis, partial or incomplete peace will not last,\r\nand a unilateral accord will not lead to a fair and\r\ncomprehensive peace. From now on we should not look to\r\nthe past with pain and sorrow; rather, we should look to the\r\nfuture with hope and confidence.\r\nIn the end, the success of the peace process hinges on\r\ngenuine and serious commitment on the part of Israel to\r\nimplement United Nations resolutions, particularly those that\r\ncall for complete and unconditional withdrawal from the\r\nSyrian Arab Golan. In the same vein, Israel must withdraw\r\nits forces from Southern Lebanon, without any further delay,\r\nin compliance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978).\r\nI take this opportunity to commend the Lebanese\r\nGovernment for its remarkable effort to build national\r\nreconciliation in Lebanon. For its part, Kuwait will continue\r\nto back the Lebanese people in their efforts to reconstruct\r\nand rehabilitate their homeland.\r\nThe tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\ncontinues unabated. That people is the target of brutal\r\naggression by the Serbs and the Croats, who want to impose\r\na fait accompli and to make territorial gains by imposing a\r\ngrossly unjust settlement on the Muslims of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nWe call upon the Security Council and the European\r\nCommunity to take all urgent and effective measures to\r\nprevent the aggressor from gaining any reward and to refuse\r\nto legitimize the outcome of outright aggression. We appeal\r\nto the international community to lift the embargo on arms\r\nsupplies to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to\r\nenable its people to exercise their right to self-defence, as set\r\nforth in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nA few days ago, Kuwait was pleased to receive the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The\r\nvisit was the culmination of Kuwait’s constant support for\r\nthe struggle of that Muslim nation, and it demonstrated our\r\ndeep, comprehensive and unwavering commitment to Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina.\r\nKuwait firmly welcomes the agreement that has been\r\nreached between the Government of President de Klerk and\r\nthe other parties involved in the negotiations on the future\r\npolitical and social structure in South Africa. The thrust of\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 25\r\nthis accord is to end the system of apartheid, which divides\r\nsociety into segments whose rights and prerogatives are\r\nbased on the colour of their skin. We applaud this historic\r\nagreement, which will put all the people of South Africa,\r\nirrespective of class, on a totally new humanitarian cause,\r\nenabling all South Africans to unleash their energies in the\r\nbuilding of a new society.\r\nFor its part, Kuwait has complied fully with all the\r\nboycott regulations. Together with other members of the\r\ninternational community, it contributed to the creation of the\r\neffective mechanism that eventually led to the agreement in\r\nquestion. Now we intend to take the necessary measures on\r\nthe national level to lift sanctions in response to\r\nMr. Nelson Mandela’s recent appeal from this rostrum. Our\r\naction will be in line with the global trend towards the\r\ncreation of conditions conducive to the\r\nfulfilment of the targets set out in the agreement. My\r\nGovernment will review Kuwaiti national legislation that\r\nprohibits dealings with the Government of South Africa, in\r\nthe light of the national agreement in South Africa,\r\ninternational consensus and the important statement in which\r\nMr. Nelson Mandela called for an end to the economic\r\nsanctions while continuing to maintain the ban on\r\nconventional and nuclear weapons.\r\nWe welcome also the proposal by the Multilateral\r\nNegotiating Council and the agreement that has been reached\r\nto enable the young Republic of Namibia to have its\r\nterritorial rights in respect of Walvis Bay and the off-shore\r\nislands restored.\r\nParallel to the heart-warming transformations on the\r\nworld political arena, there are some significant economic\r\nindicators. The issues relating to the world economic\r\nsituation are of great concern to my Government. In our\r\nview, top priority must be given, on the international\r\neconomic agenda, to the economic plight of the developing\r\ncountries, especially the most impoverished among them, so\r\nthat they may be helped to alleviate the severe suffering of\r\ntheir populations.\r\nConvinced that the future of the world and the well-\r\nbeing of its inhabitants require wholesome approaches that\r\nbalance the use of resources with conservation of the\r\nenvironment, Kuwait has played an active role in the\r\ninternational forums dealing with the questions of the\r\nenvironment and energy. We are extremely keen on the\r\npromotion of international cooperation with a view to\r\nachieving wider development and removing obstacles that\r\nimpede it. We believe, however, that priority should be\r\naccorded to national and international efforts that aim at\r\nachieving overall social and economic development and\r\nincreasing political stability.\r\nThe individual must always be the focus of every\r\ndevelopment effort. All development policies should be\r\nflexible enough to accommodate the ingenuity and creative\r\npower of all individuals. This is indeed our guarantee of\r\nprogress and excellence in human endeavour. International\r\ninstitutions should provide the platform and the framework\r\nto harness our national efforts towards that end.\r\nThe new international orientation, in its political and\r\neconomic aspects, presents us with yet another window of\r\nopportunity. As interdependent partners, we should forge\r\nahead together so that, together, we may reap the common\r\nbenefits of the new order.\r\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMr. HAAVISTO (Finland): I wish to begin by\r\ncongratulating Ambassador Insanally on his election to the\r\nhigh office of the presidency of the General Assembly. He\r\ncan rest assured that the delegation of Finland will render\r\nhim its full support in his challenging task.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, I also wish to\r\ncongratulate and extend a warm welcome to the new\r\nMembers among us. Their participation in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations will further strengthen the Organization.\r\nJust a few years ago, in a promisingly changing\r\npolitical environment, high hopes were placed in the United\r\nNations. Some of these hopes were fulfilled, others were\r\nnot. Namibia’s independence process is a fine example of\r\nnation-building in which the United Nations played a crucial\r\nrole. Eritrea is another. Let these be examples of wise and\r\npatient conciliation and conflict management. Yet another\r\nexample is South Africa, where today we see irrevocable\r\nchanges taking place, leading towards a non-racial and\r\ndemocratic society. I wish to express my Government’s\r\nadmiration for the achievements of the parties in South\r\nAfrica in their work for peace, cooperation and mutual\r\nrespect. Finland has actively supported the shaping of a new\r\nSouth Africa and will continue to do so.\r\nWe have in recent days witnessed yet another example\r\nof brave and visionary leadership which can overcome\r\nseemingly insuperable obstacles and lead peoples from a\r\nstate of war and hatred towards reconciliation. I am\r\nreferring to the peace accord between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization. In this context I wish to\r\npay a tribute to the Government of Norway for its role in\r\nbringing the two parties together. The United Nations must\r\nnow stand ready to play its part in this important endeavour\r\nfor peace. Finland, together with the other Nordic countries,\r\nwas among the first to initiate an international support\r\nprogramme for this historic process.\r\nThe United Nations also has to its credit other\r\nachievements in recent years. Among the most important\r\nhave been the rebuttal of the aggression against Kuwait and\r\nthe restoration of democracy in Cambodia. However,\r\nnumerous other conflicts have proved very difficult to solve.\r\nWar is raging in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia,\r\nAngola, Abkhazia and Nagorny-Karabakh. Conflicts persist\r\nin Western Sahara and Cyprus. All these conflicts constitute\r\nformidable challenges to the international community and to\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nFrom that balance sheet of success and failure an\r\nimportant question emerges: how can our Organization be\r\nbest adapted, reformed and revitalized to face effectively not\r\nonly the challenges of today but also those of tomorrow?\r\nUndoubtedly the United Nations is today a more viable\r\ninstitution than ever before. Nevertheless the many unsolved\r\nconflicts illustrate that the United Nations still has serious\r\nshortcomings. These stem primarily from the nature of the\r\nproblems and challenges of the increasingly interdependent\r\nglobal society in which we live.\r\nIt is now our responsibility to launch a process of\r\nreform of the United Nations. It must cover all of the\r\nOrganization’s agencies, programmes and funds, in both the\r\npolitical and the development fields. It must be undertaken\r\nin an integrated manner, with a view to better adapting our\r\ninstruments of cooperation to the needs of a profoundly\r\nchanging world.\r\nMany crises seem political in nature but have their\r\nroots in social injustices and a lack of economic\r\nopportunities. The fulfilment of social needs and the\r\npromotion of economic development are necessary elements\r\nof sustained political stability. Some significant\r\nimprovements have been made in this field, too, but their\r\nscope and importance are clearly dwarfed by the immensity\r\nof the challenges. Human development, human rights and\r\nthe environment are cases in point.\r\nThanks to the dynamic initiatives of our\r\nSecretary-General, a process of reform of the United Nations\r\nis under way. In addition, several Member States have\r\nintroduced important proposals for reforming and\r\nrestructuring our Organization. My own country, together\r\nwith other Nordic countries, has actively participated in this\r\nprocess, particularly as regards peace-keeping and reform of\r\nthe United Nations work in the economic and social sector\r\nand in the area of humanitarian assistance.\r\nWorld events have forced the United Nations and its\r\nMember States to re-examine closely the Organization’s\r\ncapacity to maintain international peace and security. The\r\nCharter provisions as well as the structures and machinery\r\ncreated for this purpose reflect a world that was very\r\ndifferent from the one we live in today. That is, of course,\r\nthe reason for the great attention that has been accorded over\r\nthe past year or two to what traditionally has been called\r\npeace-keeping. The concept of peace-keeping is, as a result\r\nof increasingly complex operations, going through a period\r\nof evolution. Related activities such as preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-building are the new\r\ntools for maintaining international peace and security.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 27\r\nThe United Nations and its Member States must adjust\r\nto the rapid growth in and new approaches to peace- keeping\r\noperations. The President of the Security Council in his\r\nstatement of May this year outlined the operational principles\r\nin accordance with which such operations should be\r\nconducted. My Government fully subscribes to these\r\nprinciples.\r\nThe great increase in requests for peace-keeping troops,\r\nmilitary observers and monitors makes it necessary, in my\r\nGovernment’s view, for the United Nations to adopt stricter\r\nand clearer criteria and procedures before launching such\r\noperations. The United Nations must not overextend itself;\r\nit cannot be present everywhere.\r\nMandates for peace-keeping operations must be precise\r\nand clear. The necessary funding must be secured, and\r\nbefore launching any operations the Security Council must\r\nsee to it that the required contingents are available. Recent\r\nexperiences also prove that command structures must be\r\nclearly spelled out and subsequently fully adhered too. It is\r\nnot sufficient for the Security Council to agree on\r\nresolutions setting up new operations; all the conditions for\r\ntheir implementation must also be at hand.\r\nWe also face new challenges in disarmament and arms\r\ncontrol. The nuclear arms race has stopped, but nuclear\r\nproliferation still constitutes a serious potential threat to\r\ninternational security and stability. It is vital to ensure that\r\nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty regime works efficiently. In\r\ngeneral, disarmament and arms regulation should be\r\nintegrated into the broader agenda of international peace and\r\nsecurity. This should be reflected both in the United Nations\r\ndisarmament machinery and in the Geneva Conference on\r\nDisarmament. The review of the composition of the\r\nConference on Disarmament would enhance this objective.\r\nWe regret that no agreement on this issue has been reached\r\nso far.\r\nThe Security Council is vested with the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. In carrying out its duties, the Council acts on\r\nbehalf of the entire membership of the United Nations.\r\nTrust and confidence in the Council by all Member States is\r\ntherefore a crucial factor, affecting its ability to engage in\r\nconflict resolution. It is only natural that a review be\r\nundertaken of the composition of the Security Council in\r\norder to make the Council better reflect today’s membership\r\nas well as the prevailing political realities.\r\nMy Government has an open mind on this question.\r\nWe are ready to accept a limited increase in the membership\r\nof the Council, provided that such a change will not affect\r\nnegatively the capacity of the Council to perform its tasks.\r\nMoreover, there would seem to be a need to review the\r\nCouncil’s organization and methods of work. The aim\r\nshould be to increase transparency and to provide\r\nnon-members better opportunities to be heard when matters\r\nof immediate concern to them are considered by the Council.\r\nIt would seem desirable - especially in negotiating the\r\nmandates and the financing of peace-keeping operations - to\r\ninvolve to a greater extent non-members of the Council also,\r\nas provided for by the Charter. Such involvement would be\r\nparticularly called for in the case of those States that are\r\npotential contributors of troops and logistical support.\r\nWork on revitalizing the General Assembly and\r\nrationalizing its activities is also under way. Certain\r\nimprovements have already been introduced. However,\r\nfurther efforts have to be made to ensure a more meaningful\r\nand responsible role for the Assembly. To enhance the\r\nAssembly’s standing and add weight to its resolutions it is,\r\nin our view, necessary to establish clear priorities. It is\r\nimportant to focus the work in the Assembly on these\r\npriorities and to reduce the number of items on its agenda.\r\nIndeed, time has come to consider even some radical\r\nmethods to enhance the effectiveness of the Assembly. One\r\nmight ask whether a full-fledged General Assembly session\r\nevery year is really necessary and productive. Alternatively,\r\na high-level political debate and meetings of the Main\r\nCommittees might be held every other year. Moreover, the\r\nPresident and the Bureau of a session of the General\r\nAssembly could perhaps be designated well before the end\r\nof the preceding session. That would permit the officers of\r\nthe General Assembly and the Secretariat better to prepare\r\nthe work of the General Assembly. These and other ideas\r\nmerit further consideration.\r\nThe economic and social sectors of the United Nations,\r\nincluding the Economic and Social Council itself, are other\r\nareas where reforms are being actively discussed. The\r\nNordic countries initiated a reform of the operational\r\nactivities for development. Although there is virtual\r\nagreement on a number of reform issues, there are still\r\ndetails to be settled concerning the governance and financing\r\nof the development agencies of the United Nations. I hope\r\nthat these much needed reforms can be agreed upon by the\r\nend of November so that the new structures can be put in\r\nplace as early as 1994.\r\nDuring the discussions on the ongoing reforms it has\r\nbecome obvious that the extraordinary extent and rapidity of\r\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\neconomic and social change, as well as the challenges of the\r\nglobal environment, necessitate reforms that are even much\r\nmore profound. We must now devote our efforts to a\r\nreorientation of the United Nations system in this new and\r\ndaunting environment. We should, in particular, clarify our\r\nthinking about the institutional and structural linkages\r\nbetween work on peace and security and work on sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Likewise, we should establish the true\r\npriorities in the economic and social sectors as well as in the\r\nUnited Nations system’s relations with other international\r\norganizations. Such rethinking and reform cannot be carried\r\nout during one single session of the General Assembly. It\r\nwill take a sustained effort over several years, which, in turn,\r\npresupposes a consensus on the basic outlines of a reform\r\nprogramme.\r\nThe shaping of a consensus is our primary task. The\r\nagenda for development which the Secretary-General will\r\npresent will no doubt have a catalytic effect in this respect,\r\nas could the upcoming important conferences on population,\r\nsocial development and gender issues. The fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations will, in my view, provide\r\na suitable occasion for launching such an ambitious,\r\nfundamental and visionary reform programme.\r\nIn order for the United Nations to function effectively\r\nit must have a solid executive branch, a Secretariat that has\r\nat its disposal sufficient human and financial resources. The\r\nSecretary-General has taken several steps to streamline the\r\nSecretariat and make it a more efficient tool for\r\nimplementing the decisions of the Member States. But more\r\nneeds to be done in order to permit the Secretariat to take\r\ninitiatives and pursue its intellectual leadership role.\r\nAt a time when resources are scarce and so many new\r\ntasks have been entrusted to the United Nations, it is clear\r\nthat a pruning of activities and rationalization of working\r\nmethods must be done. The cutting of unnecessary and\r\nobsolete programmes must continue. It is the task of the\r\nMember States to give guidance to the Secretary-General,\r\nbut also to draw conclusions and take the necessary\r\ndecisions. The United Nations should apply the same policy\r\nof austerity as national Governments in the prevailing\r\neconomic circumstances.\r\nPerhaps the greatest concern for the United Nations\r\ntoday is the unwillingness of the great majority of Member\r\nStates to pay their assessed contributions. My delegation has\r\nsaid time and again, and I will repeat it now: Payment of\r\none’s dues is not an option. It is an obligation falling on\r\nevery Member, big or small. Let it be our collective\r\nbirthday present to the United Nations at the fiftieth\r\nanniversary to see to it that by then there is full compliance\r\nwith the obligation concerning payment of contributions.\r\nMember States, in fulfilling their financial obligations\r\ntowards the United Nations, have the right to expect full\r\naccountability for the resources placed at the disposal of the\r\nOrganization. It is essential that the Organization exercise\r\nprudent economic management and constantly improve the\r\ninternal control system. We therefore believe that ideas such\r\nas the creation of the post of an independent inspector\r\ngeneral are well worth considering. The main objective\r\nmust now be to restore the confidence of the Member States\r\nand the general public in our Organization. The United\r\nNations cannot afford to have its public image and integrity\r\ntarnished by allegations of mismanagement.\r\nAs the United Nations approaches its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, humanity is faced with formidable challenges.\r\nMeeting them will not be easy. And yet, the United Nations\r\nnow has a better chance than ever to use its full potential\r\nand show leadership for the sake of a better future. \"We the\r\npeoples of the United Nations, ... united for a better world\"\r\nhas been chosen as the theme for the celebration of our\r\nfiftieth anniversary. Let us all together join in making this\r\na reality.\r\nMr. KASENALLY (Mauritius): On behalf of the\r\nMauritius delegation, it is my pleasure and privilege to\r\nextend to Mr. Insanally our heartiest congratulations on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session. We wish to assure him and members of his\r\nBureau of our full cooperation and support in the tasks that\r\nlie ahead of them. The election of a representative of\r\nGuyana to the presidency of this Assembly is gratifying in\r\nmore ways than one and underlines the fact that even the\r\nsmallest of States belonging to this Organization has a role\r\nto play on the international scene and will not shy away\r\nfrom any responsibility that may be entrusted to it, however\r\nbig the challenge.\r\nWe should also like to place on record our appreciation\r\nof his predecessor for the commendable manner in which he\r\nconducted the deliberations of the forty-seventh session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMauritius is pleased to welcome into the family of the\r\nUnited Nations its new Members: Andorra, the Czech\r\nRepublic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Slovak Republic and The\r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We are hopeful\r\nthat these new Members will uphold and strengthen the\r\nideals enshrined in the Charter of this Organization and we\r\nlook forward to their active participation in our deliberations.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 29\r\nIt is important, in my delegation’s view, that I address\r\nin the first instance an issue of prime concern to the\r\nfunctioning of our Organization. There is at present much\r\ndebate and ambivalence about the future role and\r\norientations of the United Nations. While it is generally\r\naccepted that the United Nations as a multilateral\r\norganization should adapt to and reflect the profound\r\nchanges that have taken place since its founding,\r\nconsiderable doubt exists on what proposals and practical\r\nmeasures should be adopted to make the United Nations\r\nsystem more effective and forge it into a relevant instrument\r\nof global governance. Is the United Nations able to respond\r\nto the new demands, opportunities and challenges that have\r\nemerged especially since the end of the cold war and still\r\nremain true to its Charter? That the United Nations in\r\nrecent years has already been able to play a more central\r\nrole in world affairs and assume greater responsibilities in\r\nthe wide range of social and political problems is an\r\nindication that it has earned the growing acceptance of the\r\nworld community as a legitimate vehicle for addressing\r\nsignificant global issues.\r\nHowever, beneath the prestige of regained moral stature\r\nand recognition that its ideals and message are still valid is\r\nthe reality that the United Nations administrative structures\r\nand institutions are in dire need of reform. The United\r\nNations system remains ill-equipped for the scope of its\r\ncurrent operations and activities. The evolving nature of the\r\nUnited Nations will therefore have a crucial impact on the\r\nfuture shape and management of the post-cold-war\r\ninternational economic and political environment.\r\nThe current debate on revitalization and restructuring\r\nhinges on whether the United Nations should become more\r\nfocused or more encompassing. Despite clear\r\npronouncements for change at the level of the Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council, social and economic organs and peace-\r\nkeeping operations, it is evident that many Member States\r\nare neither expecting the process to result in any sweeping\r\nstructural reforms nor contemplating a revision of the\r\nCharter.\r\nProgress will therefore need to come from within, the\r\nresult of a balancing act between divergent interests and\r\npolitical considerations. It would be unfortunate, however,\r\nif such an agreement were merely a reflection of a lowest\r\ncommon denominator rather than the product of genuine\r\ncooperation.\r\nI concede that the reform of such an Organization is no\r\neasy task and requires the assistance of one and all. Last\r\nyear the Mauritius delegation to the General Assembly\r\ncommended the Secretary-General’s efforts at reforming our\r\nOrganization. I should like to reiterate our appreciation for\r\nwhat has been achieved so far and our support for the work\r\ncurrently being undertaken by the Secretary-General to\r\nrevitalize the United Nations.\r\nI remain convinced that the emerging global situation\r\nhas brought the objective of restructuring the United Nations\r\nsystem within reach. Such reform should, in the end, cater\r\nfor the aspirations of the peoples of this world and enable\r\nthe Organization to respond favourably to the emerging new\r\nexpectations.\r\nThe General Assembly, we believe, ought to be\r\nencouraged, by its increased membership and a general trend\r\ntowards democratization, to assume a more preponderant\r\nplace in the affairs of the Organization. It should strengthen\r\nits policy-making role, especially in the social and economic\r\nfields, so as to exercise greater balance with the Security\r\nCouncil, whose mandate is now expanding beyond the\r\ntraditional delineation of threats to peace and security into\r\nsuch areas as human-rights violations and humanitarian\r\nassistance, through preventive diplomacy and innovative\r\npeace-keeping operations. Thus, while remaining the crucial\r\nforum for discussion, the General Assembly would increase\r\nits capacity to respond to major problems and take\r\ninitiatives.\r\nOn the other hand, greater consensus among its\r\nmembers has enabled the Security Council to assert its\r\nauthority and break new ground in authorizing the use of\r\nforce under Chapter VII of the Charter - for example, in\r\nSomalia, where domestic jurisdiction would normally apply,\r\nor Yugoslavia, through preventive action. The Council has\r\nalso had more frequent recourse to sanctions, using them on\r\nfive occasions since 1990. The intensification of the United\r\nNations presence has undeniably enhanced the reputation of\r\nthe Organization. But it has also raised questions about the\r\nCouncil’s composition and apprehension over its decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nThe new responsibilities and importance assumed by\r\nthe Council would justify, in our view, some form of\r\nenlargement to reflect the new level of membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. A more representative Council would earn\r\nrecognition and legitimate acceptance and be able to take\r\naction quickly and effectively with the imprimatur of\r\nfairness.\r\nThe Council could, we believe, withstand changes and\r\nstill retain its main executive function, while improving at\r\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe same time its coordination with other United Nations\r\nbodies, such as the General Assembly.\r\nPeace-keeping has become one of the major\r\nresponsibilities of the Council. The rapid expansion of\r\npeace-keeping operations and the huge involvement of\r\nUnited Nations personnel in this area have boosted\r\nconfidence in the Organization and given it a higher\r\ninternational profile. Unfortunately, peace-keeping is also\r\nbecoming a heavy burden in terms of financial and human\r\nresources, which threatens to curtail the Organization’s\r\ninvolvement in other priority areas. Peace-keeping should\r\nnot be confined merely to narrow security objectives,\r\nexcluding broader considerations of non-military threats to\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe Security Council has, in fact, special responsibility\r\nin shaping the future of peace-keeping as an effective\r\nsafeguard in areas of conflict, or potential conflict, in\r\nvolatile domestic or regional situations where major threats\r\nto international peace reside today.\r\nHowever, as the Secretary-General notes in his report\r\non the implementation of the recommendations of his\r\n\"Agenda for Peace\",\r\n\"Peace-keeping is in a state of rapid evolution as the\r\nUnited Nations is asked to undertake increasingly\r\ncomplex and dangerous tasks.\" (A/47/965, para. 26)\r\nAs the mandate of peace-keeping operations extends beyond\r\ntheir traditional domain into such areas as electoral\r\nassistance, humanitarian relief activities, human-rights\r\nmonitoring, assistance for nation-building, border-monitoring\r\nand sanctions enforcement, clearer peace-keeping guidelines\r\nand standards, based on properly defined mandates and\r\nadequate financial support, become essential. Within the\r\nparameters of fundamental principles and their interpretation,\r\npeace-keeping operations should be designed to work. The\r\nUnited Nations has made good use of the lessons of concrete\r\nand painful experience.\r\nMauritius, for its part, would like to suggest that when\r\ncarrying out the reform exercise we should not only address\r\nthe issues of financial resources or expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, but also look at matters\r\nof concern raised in other forums and their attendant\r\nconsequences for this Organization. We should, hence, not\r\nfail to give due attention to the principles contained in the\r\nDeclaration on International Economic Cooperation, adopted\r\nat the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly,\r\nespecially with respect to the rejuvenation of equitable\r\neconomic growth and development. We must bear clearly\r\nin mind other new and globally agreed programmes, such as\r\nthe New Agenda for the Development of Africa, Agenda\r\n21, which came out of the Rio Conference, and the\r\nrecommendations of the second World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nAny changes in the structure of the United Nations\r\nshould be the product of as large a consensus as possible, in\r\norder to preserve the credibility of our Organization, and in\r\nthis task we must be guided inexorably by the spirit of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nHowever, while we uphold this spirit, it is our opinion\r\nthat serious consideration should be given to a review of the\r\nprovisions of the Charter. A rereading of the Charter would\r\nenable us to look anew at its contents and allow us to\r\npropose amendments in the light of new world realities. I\r\nalso urge that the Assembly insist on greater clarity in its\r\nresolutions. This will certainly facilitate action and prevent\r\ntime lost discussing varying interpretations of resolutions.\r\nNo doubt, one of the most striking events since the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly has been the second World\r\nConference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in June of this\r\nyear. The Conference was an opportunity to review the\r\nevolution of the attitudes of the peoples of the world towards\r\nthe upholding of the rights and dignity of man since the first\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights, which was held in\r\nTehran in 1968. The quarter of a century that separates the\r\nholding of these two Conferences has witnessed a lot of\r\nchanges, notably the assertion of those States which emerged\r\nfrom the demise of colonization.\r\nIn Vienna, both the old and the new players in the\r\nworld’s human rights forums were able to put forward their\r\nconcerns and aspirations. The discussions, though not\r\nalways easy, had the advantage of being frank. We in\r\nMauritius firmly believe that the end result of the\r\nConference will be beneficial to the protection of the rights\r\nof the individual. We must see to it, however, that the\r\nprovisions of the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action are\r\nimplemented and do not become mere additional documents\r\nin the international archives. In this context, I wish yet\r\nagain to make a special appeal to this Assembly for a\r\nsubstantial increase in the resources of the Centre for Human\r\nRights to enable it to attend to its responsibilities with\r\nconsistency and efficiency and thus contribute more\r\neffectively to the universal upholding of human rights.\r\nMauritius wishes to reiterate, in the most forceful\r\nmanner possible, its support for the recommendation of the\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 31\r\nsecond World Conference on Human Rights that this\r\nAssembly address urgently the need to establish a post of\r\nUnited Nations high commissioner for human rights. It is\r\nour sincere hope that a favourable decision will be reached\r\nto reflect the wishes of the peoples of the world. Such an\r\noffice would play the necessary role of coordinating United\r\nNations work on human rights and would be the focal point\r\nfor upholding human rights norms.\r\nIn keeping with its stand on human rights issues,\r\nMauritius would also like to state its support for the\r\nresponsibilities assigned to the International Tribunal for the\r\nprosecution of those responsible for the serious crimes\r\ncommitted against humanity in the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia since 1 January 1991. We would like to\r\ncongratulate all those eminent persons who have been\r\nelected to sit on this Tribunal and wish them well in their\r\ndifficult task.\r\nIndeed, we view with great concern and sadness the\r\natrocities and untold sufferings endured by the peoples of the\r\nformer Republic of Yugoslavia, particularly the children.\r\nLet the impartial conclusions of the Tribunal serve as a\r\nlesson to those who believe they can get away with such\r\ndegrading actions, such disrespect for human life. The\r\nseriousness and steadfastness with which the Tribunal carries\r\nout its duty will bear witness to the fact that the world\r\ncommunity does not remain insensitive and will not be\r\ncomplacent in the face of such despicable and reprehensible\r\nacts wherever and whenever they occur. Yet as this century\r\nof our so-called civilized world fades away, the history of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina will be written with the blood of\r\nthousands of innocent men, women and children.\r\nEarlier this year the world exulted at the news that\r\nFrance, the United States of America and the Russian\r\nFederation had voluntarily extended their moratoriums on\r\nnuclear testing. It is heartening to observe that 1993 may\r\nyet be the year when the world will have enjoyed the longest\r\nrespite from nuclear testing and its attendant consequences,\r\ndespite the recent disturbing reports pointing to the\r\npossibility of a resumption of nuclear testing by certain\r\ncountries. No one doubts the nuclear strength of the\r\ncountries which have made the moratorium a policy and it\r\nis to their credit that they have so far not been tempted to\r\nshow their might by resuming nuclear testing.\r\nIt is our sincere wish that members of the nuclear club\r\nadhere to their declared moratoriums, for the resumption of\r\nnuclear testing by any of those States would jeopardize the\r\n1995 conference for the review and extension of the\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty, and would, to our mind, inevitably\r\nundermine the current efforts aimed at global disarmament.\r\nIt would be unrealistic on our part not to recognize that,\r\ndespite uncertainties and ongoing foyers of tension, the\r\nworld political climate has improved considerably. As cold\r\nwar rivalry faded, significant bilateral progress was made\r\nwith the conclusion of the START Treaties and the\r\nsubsequent agreements for reduction in the respective\r\nnuclear arsenals of the erstwhile super-Powers. These\r\npositive efforts were reinforced internationally by the\r\ndecision of a number of States, including France, China and\r\nSouth Africa, to adhere to the non-proliferation Treaty at a\r\ncrucial phase in its review process.\r\nSuch encouraging developments bode well for all small\r\nnations like ours whose safety rests upon the foundations of\r\na reliable collective security system. The recent historic\r\nagreement between the PLO and Israel and the imminent\r\nconstitution of a democratic non-racial South Africa should\r\npave the way for rapid progress towards the denuclearization\r\nof Africa. Likewise, we note with great satisfaction the\r\nconsensus emerging in the deliberations of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee on the Indian Ocean to adopt new approaches in\r\nresponse to the changing international situation and give\r\nfresh impetus to the process of strengthening cooperation,\r\npeace, security and stability in the Indian Ocean region. The\r\nincreased participation in this year’s session suggests that the\r\nGeneral Assembly could accordingly consider broadening the\r\nCommittee’s mandate.\r\nSuccess at the regional level depends largely on a\r\nglobal atmosphere that is conducive to disarmament. We\r\nwish therefore to reiterate, in this perspective, the importance\r\nof the current negotiations for the review of the NPT and the\r\nconclusion of a test ban which should provide non-nuclear\r\nStates with firm security assurances and address the various\r\nissues of nuclear proliferation. The threat of the spreading\r\nof smaller nuclear weapons is compounded by the\r\navailability of weapons-grade nuclear material produced\r\nfrom plutonium and highly enriched uranium and the relative\r\nlack of proper commercial safeguards. To these dangers\r\nmust be added the potential hazard of nuclear pollution and\r\nthe dumping of toxic wastes.\r\nCasting a glance at the world in general, we have\r\nreason to hope for the advent of peace in the various hitherto\r\nviolence-ridden regions of our planet in a not-too-distant\r\nfuture. On the African continent, we note a trend towards\r\nsolutions to difficult situations. In Mozambique, we salute\r\nthe signing of the General Peace Agreement for\r\nMozambique between the Government of Mozambique and\r\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nRENAMO, the Mozambique national resistance movement.\r\nWe commend the positive contribution of the United Nations\r\noperations in Mozambique. We urge the leaders concerned\r\nto show sufficient flexibility in the current negotiations\r\naimed at elaborating appropriate electoral laws for the\r\ncountry.\r\nSouth Africa is another source of hope. We in\r\nMauritius have been following very closely the evolution of\r\ndiscussions in the multiparty negotiating forum and are\r\nparticularly appreciative of the resolution adopted\r\nunanimously by the Technical Negotiating Council on\r\n16 August 1993, which endorses the return of Walvis Bay\r\nand the offshore islands to Namibia. We have had the\r\nopportunity to congratulate those responsible for this very\r\npositive step, which we also applaud as a confidence-\r\nbuilding measure in that region.\r\nWe welcome the installation of the Transitional\r\nExecutive Council and wish to pledge our readiness - as a\r\ncountry which has made, in its own modest way, its share of\r\ncontributions to the democratization process across the\r\nworld - to help in the preparations leading to the elections of\r\n27 April 1994.\r\nThe capacity to dismantle apartheid, establish the basis\r\nof a new constitution by consensus, and agree on an\r\nelection date within a few years is no mean achievement.\r\nHowever, whilst many rapid and positive changes are taking\r\nplace, South Africa continues to be plagued by ceaseless\r\nviolence. Time and again we have deplored the upsurge of\r\nviolence which has cost the lives of several of Africa’s most\r\nillustrious sons, among them the sorely missed Chris Hani.\r\nWe therefore welcome wholeheartedly the proposal to\r\nestablish a national peace force in South Africa, made up of\r\nrepresentatives of all parties, which would be entrusted with\r\nthe task of preventing violence in particularly volatile areas.\r\nThe creation of this mechanism shows the determination and\r\nardent desire of all in South Africa to resolve outstanding\r\nissues and to proceed as planned for violence-free elections\r\nin April of next year.\r\nMr. Lukabu Khabouji N’Zaji (Zaire), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nIn Somalia, we have been distressed by the senseless\r\nkilling of members of the United Nations Forces as well as\r\nSomali civilians. The skirmishes being witnessed in Somalia\r\nhave regrettably shifted world attention away from the\r\nstarving millions to manhunts. Women and children dying\r\ndaily for want of food have been relegated insignificantly to\r\nthe backstage. Mauritius would like to call on the leaders of\r\nthe various Somali factions to revert to the agreement\r\nreached in Addis Ababa and submit themselves to the peace-\r\nkeeping process within the context of the recently established\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for the\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution of Conflicts. Our\r\nfervent appeal to all those bent on perpetuating the blood\r\nbath in Somalia is to heed the concerns of the international\r\ncommunity and indeed act in the interests of the Somali\r\npeople rather than in their own selfish interests.\r\nIn our Indian Ocean region, on an issue of direct\r\nconcern to us, I am happy to say that meaningful dialogue\r\non the Chagos Archipelago is taking place with the United\r\nKingdom authorities.\r\nWhile we hail the success of the United Nations in\r\nCambodia, we cannot but decry the atrocious situation in\r\nAngola, where thousands of lives are done away with daily.\r\nThe question that must be asked is this: to what end will a\r\ncountry depleted of its human resources serve those who, in\r\ntheir desperation to be at the helm of affairs, are ready to\r\nsacrifice countless lives and lay waste that very country?\r\nWe exhort Mr. Savimbi and his UNITA to come to terms\r\nwith reality and accept the will of the Angolan people as\r\nexpressed through the ballot box.\r\nOutside the African continent, the Middle East, which\r\nhas witnessed one of the most bitter conflicts of the century,\r\nheralds a new era. There is cause for satisfaction in the\r\nknowledge that the peace process which began at the Madrid\r\nConference in October 1991 has taken a decisive turn with\r\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\r\nextending mutual and official recognition to each other. Let\r\nus hope that the plan for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and\r\nJericho is but a prelude to Israel’s complete withdrawal from\r\nthe occupied territories, a sine qua non for a just and durable\r\npeace in the Middle East.\r\nAs I said earlier, we have reason to rejoice at the\r\nthought of more peaceful days in various areas of the world.\r\nHowever, this prospect is marred by other concerns. In Fiji\r\nthe long-awaited review of the Constitution has not yet taken\r\nplace, with the unfortunate result that the electoral system is\r\nin stagnation. We feel that meaningful changes in the\r\nConstitution, as promised by the Fijian authorities, will\r\nrestore confidence in the Fijian community and will bring\r\nabout smoother relations in the country for the benefit of all.\r\nMauritius, as a multi-cultural, multi-religious and\r\nmulti-ethnic society, is willing, in all humility, to share with\r\nFijian authorities the benefits of its own experience of\r\nharmonious living and to assist, should it be so wished, in\r\nthe review of the Constitution.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 33\r\nWhile there are promising developments in the world,\r\nthe global economy continues to evoke distress. The long-\r\nawaited economic recovery in developed countries continues\r\nto be inconsistent and uneven; global economic stability\r\nremains more elusive than ever. Economic growth and\r\ndevelopment proper are the only durable, effective and\r\nequitable solution to instability and to a host of other\r\nassociated problems facing the world. We believe, therefore,\r\nthat it is the concern of the entire world to ponder seriously\r\na new form of multilateralism which would ensure\r\nsystematic coordination of policies involving all groups of\r\ncountries.\r\nWe believe that the rapid internationalization of the\r\nworld economy points to the urgency to resume North-\r\nSouth dialogue constructively and in a spirit of cooperation\r\nand understanding. This dialogue should become an\r\ninstrument for the promotion of economic growth in\r\ndeveloping countries and should address world economic\r\nproblems practically, instead of remaining a mere slogan\r\ninterspersed now and again by half-measures aimed more at\r\nplacating genuine concerns of the South than at evolving a\r\nworkable long-term policy to bridge the ever-widening gap\r\nbetween the North and the South with immediate,\r\nmedium-term and long-term solutions to the exasperating\r\nproblems that plague most developing countries.\r\nThe efforts of most developing economies are\r\ncompromised by the consequences of unbridled\r\nprotectionism, deteriorating commodity prices, acute debt\r\nproblems, declining financial flows, poverty and\r\nunfavourable terms for the transfer of technology. However,\r\nin the face of the unfair competition that continues to hold\r\nsway on the international trade scene, we should ensure, for\r\nexample, that the provisions of the Lomé Convention that\r\nbinds the European Economic Community with the Asian,\r\nCaribbean and Pacific group of countries are upheld in any\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations.\r\nWe in Mauritius are eager for a balanced outcome of\r\nthe Uruguay Round and have therefore been extremely\r\ndisappointed at the scant attention paid to the interests of the\r\ndeveloping countries which are vulnerable to shifts in the\r\nworld economic order. The ongoing negotiations have\r\nturned out to be primarily a battle of wits and nerves among\r\nthe developed countries. We have studied the latest\r\nproposals from Geneva with attention, and our frank reaction\r\nis one of consternation and dismay.\r\nWhat is proposed is a cataclysmic operation which calls\r\nfor the system to be completely refounded, the structures that\r\nexist to be razed, and the groupings within which we\r\nconduct our foreign trade to be dismantled. What is\r\nsuggested by the major negotiators is a change so convulsive\r\nthat only the most resilient economies will emerge\r\nunscathed.\r\nMauritius considers this situation to be most unfair,\r\nunjust and, above all, counter-productive, in the long run.\r\nMauritius, which has an open economy banking on export-\r\nled growth, is in favour of free trade and liberalization of\r\nexchanges with due regard for the acquired rights of various\r\ngroups of developing countries. We believe, however, that\r\nsuch change must come about through an orderly,\r\nevolutionary process that will give ample time for\r\nadaptation, rather than through external imposition which has\r\nlittle consideration for factors other than economic. We\r\ntherefore appeal to all contracting parties to strive earnestly\r\nfor a conclusion of the Uruguay Round that will take into\r\naccount the difficulties of the developing countries and the\r\nparticular situation of small island States.\r\nBoth the United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development and the General Assembly have recognized\r\nthe specificities of small island States and the attention that\r\nshould be given to them in view of the special case they\r\nconstitute in the interrelation of environment and\r\ndevelopment. These States are characterized by their limited\r\nsize in relation to the length of their coastline, limited\r\nnatural resources, relative geographical isolation, extremely\r\nfragile and vulnerable ecosystem and a vast expanse of seas\r\nforming part of their territorial limits. For small island\r\nnations the ocean and the coastal environment are hence of\r\nprimary importance and constitute a basic development\r\nresource.\r\nThe record of the United Nations in the social and\r\neconomic fields is a mixed one. Its contribution to global\r\nawareness and respect for human rights and democratic\r\nvalues is undisputed. The Rio and Vienna Conferences were\r\nlandmarks of global cooperation, despite divergent\r\nperceptions on the strengthening of relevant institutions and\r\nadoption of concrete measures.\r\nSuch cooperation could in our view be developed by\r\nmaintaining a strong role for the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and by choosing a feasible and incremental\r\napproach to implementing the commitments made by\r\nGovernments under Agenda 21. In this regard, we look\r\nforward to the fruitful preparations for the Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States and its successful outcome in Barbados\r\nnext year, as the first test case in the ongoing Rio process.\r\nWe also feel that the General Assembly should seriously\r\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nconsider establishing an intersessional mechanism to\r\ncomplete the work of the Preparatory Committee for the\r\nConference.\r\nWe, for our part, are as committed as any of those who\r\nhave made the protection of the global environment their\r\nleitmotif. We have ratified the Climate Change Convention,\r\nthe Biodiversity Convention, the Montreal Protocol and the\r\nBasel and the Bamako Conventions, among other\r\ninstruments. Our concern is to safeguard the world and\r\nensure the well-being of those who live in it.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nLet me pursue my thoughts on participation by small\r\nStates in international life by calling attention to the fact that\r\nin a few weeks Mauritius will have the honour to host the\r\nfifth Summit of French-speaking Countries and by saying a\r\nfew words about the two principal themes that will be\r\naddressed by Heads of State or Government of countries that\r\nshare the use of the French language: human rights and\r\ndevelopment; and unity in diversity.\r\nThose timely questions illustrate our concerns at a time\r\nwhen the world is undergoing profound change and when\r\nmost of our countries continue to face challenges of\r\ndevelopment. My country wants to make its own\r\ncontribution, however modest, to the thought of the French-\r\nspeaking world and the rest of the international community\r\nso that mankind may see - based on the example of\r\nMauritius - that peaceful coexistence in a multi-cultural,\r\nmulti-ethnic, multi-linguistic culture is no mere Utopian idea.\r\nI wish to thank the Secretary-General, a great friend of\r\nthe French-speaking world, for having agreed, despite his\r\nweighty responsibilities, to honour us with his presence at a\r\nSummit that will bring together, at the highest level,\r\ndelegations from 47 countries and from all continents.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAs members will appreciate, we small States are\r\nnevertheless doing our best to make our share of\r\ncontributions in order to bequeath to future generations an\r\nenvironmentally clean world, a world free of want, a world\r\nfree of war, a world where peace and harmony will prevail.\r\nCan we expect the same from those with mightier resources?\r\nMr. ÇETIN (Turkey): At the outset, I wish to\r\ncongratulate Ambassador Insanally on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly. The fact that he was\r\nselected to guide our deliberations signifies the confidence\r\nthat Member States have in his well-known professional\r\nqualities. I am sure that, under his guidance, the present\r\nsession of the Assembly will tackle the issues on its agenda\r\nwith courage and realism.\r\nI would also like to place on record our appreciation for\r\nthe competence and wisdom of his predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, and for his outstanding\r\nperformance in steering the work of the General Assembly\r\nduring an eventful year.\r\nMy delegation takes joyful pride in welcoming Andorra,\r\nthe Czech Republic, Eritrea, Macedonia, Monaco and the\r\nSlovak Republic to the family of nations. We believe that\r\ntheir admission represents yet another milestone in further\r\nconsolidating the universality of this Organization. There is\r\nno doubt that our community will be enriched and\r\nstrengthened by their contribution to the realization of the\r\nideals of the United Nations.\r\nThe excitement and hopefulness of 1989 already seem\r\nto be part of a distant past. We both welcomed and were\r\nunprepared for the events that marked the dramatic end of\r\nthe cold war. They generated a tidal wave of optimism\r\nabout the future of international relations. Fervent talk about\r\na rapidly changing world was the order of the day when we\r\nentered the present decade. Little was done, however, to\r\ndetermine and shape the dynamics and scope of the change.\r\nIt was more or less taken for granted that this change would\r\nturn out to be for the better. That did not prove to be the\r\ncase. Accordingly, the creation of a new, desirable\r\ninternational system continues to top the political agenda as\r\nthe most challenging task of our times.\r\nThe past 12 months have demonstrated yet again that\r\nthe new world in the making might at times be as dangerous\r\nas the old, if not worse in certain respects. Nevertheless, we\r\nshould resist the impulse to indulge in a dark pessimism for\r\nwhich there can be no legitimate cause. The crucial phase\r\nof history we are going through calls for reflection and\r\npositive action, not a defeatist mood. The international\r\ncommunity should not stand by in desperation and watch\r\nconditions deteriorate. It must display the will to redirect\r\nthe course of history towards our expectations. There\r\ndefinitely exists a political space for constructive initiatives\r\nand a basis for cooperative action to that end.\r\nIt is the United Nations which defines and guards that\r\npolitical space. Indeed, the United Nations is the foremost\r\nsymbol of modern internationalism. In these turbulent post-\r\ncold-war years, hardly a day passes without the Organization\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 35\r\nbeing called upon to take the lead on some important task.\r\nThese tasks include missions for preserving or restoring\r\npeace and security, the upholding of the rule of law, and\r\nmissions to ensure the survival of mankind, to help save the\r\nenvironment, to combat social scourges and to rescue the so-\r\ncalled failing societies.\r\nSince the cold war drew to a close and the conflicts of\r\nthe transition era rose to the fore, United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations have undergone considerable\r\nexpansion in terms of their functions, size, geographical area\r\nand degree of complexity. This process has occurred in\r\ntandem with the rapid evolution of the international\r\nlandscape. The same background conditions have prompted\r\nthe emergence of preventive diplomacy, peace- enforcement\r\nand peace-building as new concepts awaiting urgent\r\ntranslation into practical and mutually supportive instruments\r\nat the disposal of the international community. Turkey’s\r\nresponse to this urgency is reflected in our contribution to\r\npeace-keeping operations\r\nAs highlighted in the Secretary-General’s report entitled\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277), effectively managing of\r\nthe crises currently confronting us and responding adequately\r\nto the challenges ahead call for the elaboration of a shared\r\nvision for the future of our Organization.\r\nIn this connection, the focus of priority attention should\r\nbe the Security Council. Today, the prestige and credibility\r\nof the United Nations depend more than ever on the\r\neffectiveness of that principal body. There is a widespread\r\ncall for the Security Council to become more responsive to\r\nthe needs of the current international scene. This can be\r\nmade possible only by making the Council more\r\nrepresentative of the new geopolitical realities. In other\r\nwords, the post-cold-war environment requires a fresh\r\napproach towards the Council’s renovation and restructuring.\r\nHence, the discussion on the twin themes of equitable\r\nrepresentation and membership enlargement is very timely.\r\nTurkey firmly believes that enlarging the Security\r\nCouncil membership would enhance its effectiveness.\r\nEnlargement should not be conceived of only as an increase\r\nin the number of members, but should also envisage the\r\ncreation of a new category of seats to be held by States that\r\ncould be qualified as semi-permanent members.\r\nSemi-permanent membership in the Council could rotate\r\namong a specific number of States designated according to\r\ncertain objective criteria: population; geopolitical posture;\r\neconomic potential; record of contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security; and\r\nequitable geographical distribution. Since Turkey fully\r\nmeets these criteria, it considers itself qualified as a\r\ncandidate for that new category of membership.\r\nA Security Council more responsive, representative,\r\ntransparent and accountable is a requirement inherent in the\r\nspirit of Article 24 of the Charter. Hence, the\r\ndemocratization of its structure would ensure more active\r\nparticipation in the Council’s work. The moral ground for\r\nthe full implementation of the Council’s resolutions would\r\nthereby be strengthened.\r\nFew, if any, would contest the fact that it was the\r\ntragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina that dispelled the\r\neuphoria prevalent during the earlier period of the post-\r\ncold-war era. Genocide and \"ethnic cleansing\" were the\r\nhallmarks of the tragedy. They were conducted with\r\nimpunity. We could neither halt, nor roll back the Serbian\r\naggression. Nor could we alleviate, in earnest the suffering\r\nof the survivors.\r\nThe example of a civic State, embracing all its citizens\r\nas equals, irrespective of their ethnic origin or religion, was\r\ngiven to us in Bosnia where a mature multicultural\r\ncivilization had evolved over many centuries. No lament\r\nover its destruction at the hands of ethnic chauvinism could\r\nbe exaggerated. Moreover, denying the Bosnians the means\r\nfor their legitimate self-defence amounts to a failure in due\r\nsupport for democracy against tyranny. A most serious blow\r\nhas been dealt to the moral essence of international law and\r\nto the contemporary principles of conduct among nations.\r\nAny document endorsing the consequences of\r\nexpansionism, genocide and \"ethnic cleansing\" cannot usher\r\nin real peace. No peace throughout history has been lasting\r\nwhen based on rewarding injustice, aggression and racism.\r\nWe cannot relieve our conscience by fabricating realpolitik\r\nexcuses for our inaction and silence. Appeasement is no\r\npolicy, but partnership in wrongdoing.\r\nThe stakes in Bosnia are much higher than those related\r\nto the survival of the Bosnian State and its people. They\r\ninclude the validity of our hope to do away with ethnic and\r\nreligious warfare in the future. The betrayal of Bosnia as a\r\nmulticultural, multi-ethnic State, invalidates this hope - and\r\nwith it the fundamental principles of our Organization. If\r\nwe allow dictatorship and adventurism to get away with the\r\ncrimes they have committed in Bosnia, the post-cold-war\r\ndisorder may worsen. Continued denial of the right of the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to defend itself\r\naggravates the responsibility of the international community\r\nfor what is happening there. Should Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina disintegrate, not only the Balkans and Europe,\r\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nbut the whole world, will eventually suffer the bitter\r\nafter-effects.\r\nTurkey will continue to pursue actively the course of\r\njustice and legitimacy to support the brave people of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina in their struggle for survival and\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThe sinister success of Serbian expansionism in Bosnia\r\nhas emboldened aggressors elsewhere. A tragedy of similar\r\nproportions is occurring in the Caucasus, where Armenians\r\nhave occupied a fifth of Azerbaijani territory. Peace and\r\nstability in a sensitive region neighbouring Turkey has been\r\nseriously undermined. Security Council resolutions 822\r\n(1993) and 853 (1993), calling for the immediate,\r\nunconditional and complete withdrawal of the occupation\r\nforces, are being ignored.\r\nIt should be borne in mind that short-term military\r\nopportunism is not compatible with long-term interests.\r\nMoreover, it is fraught with unpredictable dangers. Neither\r\nin the Balkans nor in the Caucasus - nor, for that matter,\r\nanywhere else - will Turkey ever accept the acquisition of\r\nterritory by force. Unless such gross violations of\r\ninternational law are prevented and the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter vigorously upheld, the present\r\nturmoil and confusion cannot be replaced by a just and\r\npeaceful order.\r\nIt is with these thoughts in mind that Turkey strongly\r\nendorses the observations made by the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his statement on 30 August\r\nlast, at the sixty-sixth session of the Institute of International\r\nLaw in Milan. There he appropriately referred to ultra-\r\nnationalism and micro-nationalism as two of the greatest\r\ndangers menacing today’s international society. He\r\nunderlined that, by strengthening the nation State as the main\r\nsubject of international law, multilateralism preserves the\r\nworld community from these two great perils. His\r\nadmonition that\r\n\"Ultra-nationalism today may still be a temptation, at\r\ntimes, for a number of major Powers nostalgic for the\r\nperiod of hegemony\"\r\nis of particular relevance at this juncture of post-cold-war\r\ndevelopments.\r\nIndeed, the darkening shadows of ultra-nationalism and\r\nmicro-nationalism, ethnic chauvinism and neo-racism have\r\nloomed like phantoms behind the scenes in the crises that\r\nhave erupted during the last two years. The international\r\ncommunity has to cure itself of these diseases. We should\r\nnot let irredentist, hegemonic tendencies plague our future.\r\nThe newly emerging geopolitical pluralism of Eurasia has to\r\nbe kept alive with a moral commitment to the quest for\r\nglobal democratic interdependence.\r\nMost of the threats to international peace in our time\r\nare bred in climates of intolerance. We have to develop a\r\nnew mind-set for the recognition and acknowledgment of\r\nother peoples’ right to be different. We have to enlarge our\r\ncapacity for give and take.\r\nTolerance is the foundation of civil society. To build\r\na just and peaceful world order, such societies must\r\nproliferate. To that end, we need to promote a culture of\r\ntolerance all over the world.\r\nIn this spirit, and as a follow-up to resolution 47/124,\r\nTurkey will submit during the current session a draft\r\nresolution proposing the proclamation of 1995 as the United\r\nNations Year for Tolerance. Adoption of that draft\r\nresolution would help to accelerate the pace of the efforts\r\nmade in the struggle against all forms of fanaticism,\r\nfundamentalism, discrimination and persecution.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 37\r\nTolerance and social development are correlated\r\nconcepts. Accordingly, my Government attaches great\r\nimportance to concerted action at the global level aimed at\r\nsolving social problems and easing the tensions they cause.\r\nHence, we are amply satisfied that the Chilean initiative for\r\nthe convening in March 1995 of a World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment has borne fruit. Turkey will prepare for this\r\nSummit in earnest, and looks forward to contributing to its\r\nsuccess.\r\nIn this connection, Turkey welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s latest report on the work of the organization, in\r\nwhich he courageously addresses the gravity of the situation\r\nstemming from the difficulty in raising funds for\r\ndevelopment aid experienced since the end of the cold war.\r\nHe accurately observes that the poorer countries no longer\r\nhold the same interest for the rich as they did in the previous\r\ndecades of ideological competition. My Government\r\nbelieves that activities for development are just as important\r\nas peace-keeping operations. Indeed, it is those activities,\r\nincluding their humanitarian assistance dimension, which\r\nprovide the foundations for global peace and security.\r\nTurkey, stretching its budgetary means to the utmost,\r\ncontinues to be increasingly active as a donor and\r\ncontributor in the fields of economic and humanitarian\r\nsupport and solidarity.\r\nSince the beginning of 1992 we have implemented an\r\neconomic assistance package amounting to $2,893 million.\r\nThe package includes technical assistance, project financing,\r\ntraining grants and soft loans, made available to 32 countries\r\nin four continents. We are firmly committed to continuing\r\nour efforts in this domain. To increase efficiency in terms\r\nof coordination, we have set up the Turkish International\r\nCooperation Agency.\r\nOver the same period 28 countries in three continents,\r\nstricken by natural and/or man-made disasters, have received\r\nhumanitarian aid worth a total of $213 million from Turkey,\r\nin cash or in kind, as well as various forms of relief and\r\naccommodation for refugees.\r\nOffering as they do a gloomy general picture, the past\r\n12 months are nevertheless not totally bereft of reasons for\r\noptimism, which include: the processes culminating in the\r\nrestoration of democracy in Haiti and Cambodia; the positive\r\ndevelopments leading towards the building of a democratic,\r\nunited, free and non-racial South Africa; and the peaceful\r\nevolution of Eritrea to independence. A new diplomacy for\r\ndemocracy seems to be making headway. All of us must\r\nbring our full energies to bear on this phenomenon so that\r\nit may gain momentum. That momentum, in its turn, will\r\ngive impetus to the consolidation of peace, because\r\ndemocracies seldom fight each other.\r\nThe only way to advance towards democracy is\r\nprogressive and sustained democratization. The distance\r\ncovered in this process is measured by the degree of respect\r\nfor human rights and the rule of law. The convening of the\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights earlier this year enabled\r\nthe international community to identify clearly the\r\nindispensable common denominators needed in the building\r\nof pluralistic civil societies. The Conference re-emphasized\r\nthe importance of the global task of promoting and\r\nprotecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and\r\nconfirmed the commitment of the international community\r\nto securing the full and universal enjoyment of those rights\r\nthrough increased and sustained international cooperation and\r\nsolidarity.\r\nThe Vienna Declaration includes a comprehensive\r\ndefinition of terrorism as any activity aiming at the\r\ndestruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and\r\ndemocracy, threatening the territorial integrity of States and\r\ndestabilizing legitimately constituted Governments. We\r\nstrongly endorse the call by the Conference to continue\r\ntaking the necessary steps to prevent and combat terrorism.\r\nThe historic breakthrough achieved in the Middle East\r\npeace process holds the promise of concord and cooperation\r\nnot only between the Palestinians, Israel and their Arab\r\nneighbours, but on a much wider regional scale. Its positive\r\nripple effects may set in motion multi-dimensional dynamics\r\nthat could transform an entire area, stretching from the\r\nAtlantic to the Gulf and from the eastern Mediterranean to\r\nthe Indian Ocean, into one of harmony, dialogue and\r\nco-prosperity.\r\nAs a country that neighbours the Middle East, has a\r\nrecord of constructive involvement in the region’s affairs and\r\ngood traditional ties with all the parties to this dispute,\r\nTurkey hails with the utmost satisfaction this momentous\r\nshift from enmity towards reconciliation.\r\nThe momentum so gained should be fully utilized.\r\nIrreversibility of the process is not enough; the process must\r\nadvance at an accelerated pace towards the ultimate\r\nobjectives defined in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\r\nand 338 (1973).\r\nThe wise, far-sighted and courageous architects who\r\ndesigned this blueprint for rebuilding amity and peace in the\r\nMiddle East may, as ever, rest assured of Turkey’s firm\r\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsupport for and contribution to their mission. We are\r\ncommitted to assisting their endeavours in every way.\r\nThree years after the outbreak of the Gulf crisis the\r\npeople of Iraq are still subjected to hardship. This\r\nregrettable situation results from the Baghdad Government’s\r\nreluctance to comply fully with the requirements of the\r\nSecurity Council resolutions relating to the Gulf War\r\nsettlement. Compliance would tangibly demonstrate Iraq’s\r\ninterest in resuming its place in the international community.\r\nHowever, we cannot remain indifferent to the suffering\r\nof the people of Iraq. My Government firmly believes that\r\nthe international community must urgently consider\r\nimaginative ways to break this vicious circle.\r\nTurkey has been forthcoming in providing Iraq with\r\nhumanitarian assistance since 1991. By the same token, we\r\nhave decided to launch a new humanitarian assistance\r\nprogramme worth $13.5 million aimed at the entire needy\r\npopulation of northern Iraq. Our approach is without\r\nprejudice to Iraq’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.\r\nAlong with the Iraqi people, a number of countries,\r\nparticularly Iraq’s neighbours, are also exposed to the\r\nadverse effects of the continued economic sanctions. The\r\ninternational community should also devise a set of measures\r\naimed at redressing their mounting losses.\r\nMy Government is concerned over the worsening\r\nsituation in Jammu and Kashmir. We wish to see the\r\ndispute between Pakistan and India over the Kashmir issue\r\nresolved through the resumption of sustained dialogue. To\r\nthat end, Turkey will continue to support Pakistan’s\r\nendeavours in pursuit of a negotiated settlement of this\r\nlong-standing problem.\r\nAs to Cyprus, it is certainly not my intention to indulge\r\nin a consideration of the past. I am quite aware that this is\r\nnot the time, not would it be profitable, to enter into\r\nrecriminations over history. What is important is to\r\nunderstand the issue correctly while acknowledging the facts\r\nunderlying the present problems and the profound mistrust\r\nbetween the two communities. We must take careful\r\naccount of those problems and the present difficulties, but\r\nwe must build for the future.\r\nToday the Cyprus question has reached a stage where\r\nthe common desire and purpose of the international\r\ncommunity is to promote an early and comprehensive\r\nsolution. To that end, the Secretary-General continues his\r\nmission of good offices. As ever, Turkey supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts aimed at bringing about a freely\r\nnegotiated, just and viable settlement. No doubt the\r\nrealization of that objective requires a display of goodwill,\r\nunderstanding and patience by both negotiating partners in\r\nthe island. Moreover, it also calls for a carefully balanced\r\nand determined approach in order to heal the profound\r\nmistrust driving the parties apart. It is with such\r\nconsiderations that Turkey has endorsed the concept of\r\nconfidence-building measures, the scope and contents of\r\nwhich must be acceptable to both communities.\r\nWhatever the reasons that may still divide the two\r\nsides, the negotiating process must continue. It is high time\r\nfor all concerned to display realism and act with vision in\r\nsearch of a negotiated, durable solution.\r\nAt present a campaign is under way for early general\r\nelections in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. We\r\nearnestly hope that once the elections are over the Turkish\r\nCypriot side will again be able to continue to play its\r\nconstructive role in the negotiating process.\r\nTurkey lies at the very epicentre of several regions\r\nmaking up the most turbulent part of the Northern\r\nhemisphere. We are actively engaged in the post-cold-war\r\nsearch for new approaches to build peace through\r\nmultilateral action. Our objective is to reinforce the\r\ninternational security system. Only the United Nations can\r\nprovide legitimacy to regional arrangements and institutions\r\nshould the latter decide to act in the fields of militarily\r\nbacked preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peace\r\nenforcement.\r\nAll three of those categories of action are in demand on\r\nTurkey’s periphery. My Government deploys all of its\r\navailable assets to help defuse and resolve these crises. We\r\nstrive to create and consolidate interlinked areas of solidarity\r\nand processes of cooperation.\r\nIn that effort we proceed from two basic tenets. First,\r\nwe believe that the evolution of the international\r\nenvironment towards a better future is not only desirable but,\r\nin certain conditions, also possible. Secondly, we are of the\r\nopinion that such a future may materialize only through the\r\nreinforcement of respect for the rule of law along with the\r\nuniversal observance and implementation of the principles of\r\ndemocracy and tolerance.\r\nThe United Nations was created to preserve peace.\r\nHowever, it cannot be expected to help resolve the collective\r\nsecurity problems of our times unless its Member States are\r\nwilling and prepared to assume their responsibilities as\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 39\r\nupholders and enforcers of the United Nations Charter and\r\nthe contemporary norms of international behaviour.\r\nWith the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the\r\nOrganization to be celebrated in two years’ time, all of us\r\nhere must admit that the main objective defined in the\r\nCharter, namely, \"to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war,\" has not yet been achieved. In the\r\nstrengthening of peace and security our immediate task is\r\nfully to mobilize the potential of the United Nations for\r\nresolving regional and local conflicts, which have\r\nproliferated since the end of the cold war.\r\nFor the future well-being of all nations, it is high time\r\nto act with the vision and forbearance that peace requires.\r\nTurkey stands committed to continue making its own\r\ncontribution to attaining that objective.\r\nMrs. BONGO (Gabon) (interpretation from French):\r\nI should like first to take this opportunity to extend to the\r\ndelegation of India the sincerest condolences of the\r\ndelegation of Gabon on the earthquake that has just hit the\r\nregion of Sholapur.\r\nThe present session of the General Assembly is\r\nconvened at a crucial juncture in the history of international\r\nrelations. A number of significant events have occurred on\r\nthe world stage in the past few years.\r\nIn that context the election of Ambassador\r\nSamuel Insanally as President of the General Assembly is\r\nparticularly significant. It is a tribute not only to his\r\nqualities as an enlightened diplomatic, well versed in\r\ninternational questions, but to the tireless work of Guyana,\r\nhis country, on behalf of peace. On behalf of the delegation\r\nof Gabon, I extend to him our warmest congratulations on\r\nhis election to preside over this session.\r\nOur congratulations also go to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, who discharged his duties so\r\nhonourably and ably.\r\nTo our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nI repeat our firm support for his many efforts on behalf of\r\nworld peace and security.\r\nLastly, we should like to welcome the new countries\r\nthat have just joined the great family of the United Nations\r\nand to assure them of our friendship and readiness to work\r\nwith them to achieve the noble purposes for the attainment\r\nof which the Organization was founded.\r\nThe end of the cold war has made it possible to\r\nestablish new kinds of relations between States and to open\r\nthe way to a new era of hope, peace and solidarity,\r\npromoting conflict prevention, better ways of dealing with\r\nacute problems and the settlement of many of the conflicts\r\nthreatening international peace and security.\r\nIt is from that perspective that we should view the\r\nrecent initiatives which the Organization and the\r\ninternational community have undertaken.\r\nGabon welcomes with great interest the most recent\r\npolitical developments in South Africa. We welcome the\r\ncreation of a Transitional Executive Council, which will\r\nallow South Africans for the first time to take part in\r\nbuilding a new, democratic, non-racial and united South\r\nAfrica. In that spirit, we urge all other parties to accede to\r\nthe agreement creating the Council and hope they will work\r\ntowards its full implementation. Gabon believes that the\r\nchanges taking place in South Africa will have a definite\r\nimpact on the democratization process in Africa and on the\r\ncontinent’s development. We therefore hope that the appeal\r\nmade here on 24 September 1993 by President Nelson\r\nMandela for the lifting of economic sanctions and the\r\nestablishment of diplomatic relations with South Africa will\r\nbe heard and acted upon.\r\nIn Somalia too many innocent victims continue to pay\r\nthe heavy daily price of violence. While praising the efforts\r\nof the United Nations to bring peace and national\r\nreconciliation to the country, we believe that the time has\r\nperhaps come for the international community to give\r\npriority to the path of dialogue and negotiation.\r\nThe situation in Liberia remains a source of concern,\r\ndespite the hopes raised by the signing of the Cotonou\r\nAgreement on 25 July 1993. We call on the parties\r\nconcerned to begin strict implementation of that Agreement.\r\nWe make a similar appeal to the parties to the conflicts in\r\nMozambique, Rwanda and Angola.\r\nTurning specifically to Angola, I note that the optimism\r\nprevailing after the Bicesse Peace Accords soon gave way to\r\ndisappointment born of the resumption of hostilities. In that\r\nbrother country, so close to my own, the perpetuation of the\r\nsituation leads me to praise the tireless efforts of the United\r\nNations and all other initiatives aimed at restoring peace and\r\nsecurity. As in the past, Gabon will spare no efforts to help\r\nachieve a lasting settlement of that conflict.\r\nIn the Middle East the mutual recognition of Israel and\r\nthe PLO, as well as the recent signing of the interim\r\n40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\narrangements for the autonomy of Gaza and Jericho, were\r\nwelcomed with relief and deep satisfaction by my country.\r\nWe dare hope that this historic agreement will promote\r\nreconciliation between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and\r\nthe establishment of a climate of peace and cooperation in\r\nthe region.\r\nIn that regard, my country supports all United Nations\r\ninitiatives, particularly Security Council resolution\r\n833 (1993), aimed at ensuring respect for the inviolability of\r\nthe international boundary between Iraq and Kuwait, in\r\naccordance with the terms of the 1963 arrangements.\r\nIn South-East Asia we welcome the decisive role\r\nplayed by the United Nations in the restoration of peace in\r\nCambodia. The holding of free and fair elections in\r\nMay 1993, the creation of the Constituent Assembly, and the\r\nreturn to the throne of His Royal Highness\r\nPrince Norodom Sihanouk all illustrate the United Nations\r\ncommitment and the confirmed solidarity of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe tragedy unfolding in Bosnia and Herzegovina and\r\nthe serious threat of the conflict’s spreading to the entire\r\nsubregion are a source of concern for my country. We make\r\nan urgent appeal to the parties concerned to return to the\r\nnegotiating table and lay down their arms.\r\nThe Conferences recently held in Vienna and Geneva\r\non human rights and the protection of the victims of war,\r\nrespectively, were opportunities for our Organization to\r\nreaffirm its commitment to defending human rights. Gabon,\r\nwhich has always given these questions their due\r\nconsideration, encourages all United Nations efforts to\r\nprotect human rights. It would thus be appropriate to\r\nstrengthen existing structures with additional human and\r\nfinancial resources so as to promote the efficiency sought by\r\nour Organization in this area.\r\nNever has our Organization been called on to such a\r\ndegree by the international community as in the past few\r\nyears. If it is to meet all the expectations, it must adapt its\r\nmain organs to the demands of the times. We welcome the\r\nongoing reform and revitalization process and hope that it\r\nwill include consideration of equitable representation in the\r\nSecurity Council and an increase in the number of its\r\nmembers.\r\nOne area which our Organization must explore further\r\nis that of preventive diplomacy, as set forth by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his \"An Agenda for Peace\". Reflecting that\r\ntrend, the Organization of African Unity has just created\r\nmachinery to prevent, manage and settle conflicts. If it is to\r\nbe effective, this new machinery must be integrated into the\r\nframework of global disarmament.\r\nThe progress made by last 13 January, when the\r\nchemical-weapons Convention was signed, shows the\r\ninternational community’s determination to ban weapons of\r\nmass destruction, particularly chemical weapons, and its\r\nreadiness to work for general and complete disarmament.\r\nFor its part, my country is working towards that end, just as\r\nit is promoting confidence-building measures in central\r\nAfrica. It was in keeping with this involvement that we\r\nhosted the third meeting of the Permanent Consultative\r\nCommittee on security questions in our subregion. This\r\nmeeting was notable for bringing together, for the first time,\r\nall States members of the Economic Community of Central\r\nAfrican States (ECCAS).\r\nIn the course of its work the Committee stressed the\r\nadvantages for all States of the subregion of ratifying\r\ninternational legal instruments on disarmament matters. It\r\nrecommended that its Bureau play a more committed\r\npolitical role in seeking solutions to crises and conflicts\r\nlikely to disturb the peace of a member State. It encouraged\r\nStates in the subregion to pursue and strengthen the\r\ndemocratization process already under way, while respecting\r\nand promoting human rights.\r\nRegarding the creation of a permanent inter-State crisis\r\nmanagement headquarters, with a view to establishing a\r\nsubregional peace-keeping force, the Committee\r\nrecommended transitional measures, including the\r\ninvolvement of ECCAS in the field of security; a study of\r\nfeatures and types of crises and conflicts; and the creation of\r\na non-permanent committee of subregional staff offices. It\r\nfurther recommended that the United Nations be asked for\r\nassistance to carry out a study on a balanced and gradual\r\nreduction of the armed forces, equipment and military\r\nbudgets of member States. Finally, the Committee adopted\r\na draft non-aggression pact between the ECCAS member\r\nStates and decided to submit it to Heads of State or\r\nGovernment of the subregion for signature. As\r\nrepresentative of the host country at these important\r\nmeetings, and on behalf of the States of the subregion, it is\r\nmy honour and privilege to invite the General Assembly in\r\ndue course to endorse the draft resolution, which will be\r\nsubmitted to it for consideration.\r\nWhat is truly at stake for Africa is essentially the\r\neconomy. It will determine to a great extent the preservation\r\nof unity, peace and security on our continent. In that regard,\r\nthe marginalization of Africa in the world economy - as a\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 41\r\nresult of the decline of its commodity prices, the reversal of\r\nfinancial resource flows from our countries to the\r\ninternational financial institutions, and the debt burden - has\r\nonly grown during the past five years.\r\nAlready experiencing such a restrictive economic\r\nenvironment, how can we in my country welcome the idea\r\nof an energy tax and not deplore the threat of a boycott of\r\nour forest products by ecological groups in the industrialized\r\ncountries? As to the forest, the Gabon authorities have\r\nalways favoured the long-term management of our forests,\r\nthrough a logical policy of reforestation conforming with the\r\nrecommendations of the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development.\r\nMy country stresses the need to maintain every aspect\r\nof the Rio spirit aimed at managing world problems in a\r\nglobal manner, and to promote the emergence of a new\r\npartnership in international economic and financial relations.\r\nGabon considers this new approach to be a possible avenue\r\nfor the development of our countries.\r\nIn this connection, we would like to congratulate the\r\nJapanese authorities on their initiative in organizing the\r\nInternational Conference on African Development, scheduled\r\nto be held in Tokyo in October. We hope that Conference\r\nwill serve as the basis for a real and lasting partnership.\r\nIn this context, the proposal made by the President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session in his\r\nopening address that we create an agenda for development\r\nshould enjoy the full support of our Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, turning to our country’s development\r\nproblems, I feel that I must draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to the decisive role to be played by women. Our\r\nOrganization has adopted resolutions and declarations on this\r\nsubject. The political commitment has been made, but it\r\nmust be associated with consistent follow-up measures to\r\nimplement these provisions. This is a struggle that we must\r\nall of us become involved in.\r\nAnxious to take into account the role of women in the\r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural fields, the Gabonese\r\nGovernment, through the Ministry responsible for the status\r\nof women, is working towards making this commitment a\r\nreality.\r\nThe sessions of the General Assembly are for Member\r\nStates an excellent opportunity to seek together ways and\r\nmeans of attaining the noble objectives of the Charter. Is\r\nnot one of its most important goals\r\n\"To achieve international cooperation in solving\r\ninternational problems of an economic, social, cultural,\r\nor humanitarian character\"?\r\nMrs. de St. JORRE (Seychelles) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I too would like to extend to Ambassador\r\nInsanally the congratulations of Seychelles on his election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly. We wish him\r\nevery possible success in carrying out his duties.\r\nAllow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General for his tireless efforts in seeking solutions\r\nto the many problems facing the international community.\r\nOur session is opening on a note of hope, because it is\r\ntaking place only a few days after a historic event of\r\nexceptional importance. I am referring, of course, to the\r\nsigning of the peace agreement between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization. May that negotiation\r\nprovide a lesson in those areas where misunderstanding,\r\nhatred and conflicts of interest are still bringing suffering to\r\nso many.\r\nThe dramatic events and the human tragedy that are\r\ntaking place in hotbeds of tension throughout the world are\r\na credit to no one. However, we must take note of the fact\r\nthat while reaction has been passive and hesitant in some\r\ncases, it has been quick and resolute in others.\r\nThe quest for peace is nevertheless at the centre of our\r\nconcerns. The considerable financial resources our\r\nOrganization devotes to peace-keeping missions or missions\r\nto restore peace demonstrate this. This is undoubtedly proof\r\nof our own determination to bring to a halt these conflicts,\r\nwhich result in so many victims and destroy all the\r\nachievements of development.\r\nIndeed, any lasting development necessarily implies\r\nefforts to thwart the threat of certain situations turning into\r\nopen conflict.\r\n42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nFor us island States, the seas are a source of life. Our\r\nfuture depends mainly on them. And for our development\r\nto be truly lasting, we must have peace on the seas.\r\nWhile it is indisputable that old rivalries have subsided\r\nin the seas and oceans of the world, it nevertheless remains\r\ntrue that the Indian Ocean has always been coveted by all.\r\nAnd that is why we reiterate our request that the Indian\r\nOcean become truly a zone of peace and cooperation to the\r\nbenefit of coastal States. The concept of the Colombo\r\nConference is perhaps something from a bygone era, but its\r\nobjectives remain relevant today.\r\nMembers will find it easy to understand, therefore, why\r\nwe attach such great importance to the implementation of\r\nresolution 47/59 of the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly calling for the organization by the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of a meeting that would propose new alternative\r\napproaches leading to the achievement of the goals contained\r\nin the initial Declaration, taking into account the changing\r\ninternational situation.\r\nIt is in this spirit that I should like to make an appeal\r\nto the countries which have not yet done so to ratify the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea so that we can get the\r\nnecessary 60 ratifications for its entry into force. How are\r\nwe to understand that such an important Convention has\r\nbeen endorsed by only 56 countries since 1982? Of course,\r\nwe do appreciate the importance of what is at stake, but\r\ninternational solidarity must be our guide.\r\nThe International Olympic Committee would like to\r\nrevive the ancient tradition of the Olympic truce and declare\r\n1994 the International Year of Sports and of the Olympic\r\nSpirit, and we should support that proposal. Let us not\r\nunderestimate the values of the Olympic spirit. They are\r\nrich in potential applications for managing international\r\nrelations.\r\nBut no peace can be lasting while the causes of\r\nconflicts remain. These causes are selfishness, intolerance,\r\nxenophobia, discrimination and dictatorship, but also - and\r\nespecially - poverty, poor management and excessive\r\nindebtedness. These are ills that generally lead to the\r\nemergence of new conflicts. Should we not attack the root\r\ncause rather than the effect?\r\nA few years ago, financial backers made\r\ndemocratization one of the prerequisites for assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries, and as a bonus to democracy, certain\r\ncountries benefited from the generosity of the international\r\ncommunity because they had pioneered that approach.\r\nToday, most of our countries have embarked on the process\r\nof democratization - with varied results, admittedly - but the\r\ndesire to fit into the new order was the underlying reason for\r\nall. Nevertheless, this new process, and I would take the\r\ncase of the Republic of Seychelles, which has met this\r\nchallenge calmly and successfully, inevitably entailed\r\nextrabudgetary expenditures in all areas, both economic and\r\nsocial.\r\nWhile it is true that the transition to democracy is\r\nsomething which is very valuable in and of itself, the\r\nestablishment of new structures and the implementation of\r\nnew rules have nevertheless been a source of additional costs\r\nwhich have placed a heavy burden on national budgets that\r\nwere already fairly shaky. And almost everywhere, the\r\nimplementation of this democratization process required the\r\nsupport of the international community. Is this not an\r\nobjective reason to think about setting up a United Nations\r\nspecial fund to provide financial and logistical support for\r\nthese reforms?\r\nTo be viable, this democratic undertaking must seek to\r\nmeet all the challenges of a country. If it is to ensure the\r\ncontinuation of these new institutions, it must pave the way\r\nfor sustainable development commensurate with the\r\naspirations of peoples.\r\nThus, with the advent of the Third Republic, our\r\ncountry is today in a new stage of its history. For more than\r\n18 months, within the context of a constituent commission,\r\nreforms have been undertaken that will produce a new\r\nConstitution and lead to free and democratic elections. In\r\nother words, for a year and a half national activity has been\r\nslowed, and even brought to a halt in some cases, while the\r\nfundamental economic problems remain.\r\nThe Seychelles has been the scene of another\r\nmomentous event, the Fourth Indian Ocean Games, which\r\ntook place last August in conditions that were judged\r\nexceptional. Reverting to what I was saying, I would note\r\nthat the cost of the infrastructure for those Games made\r\nserious inroads into the national budget.\r\nOne might wonder how a small island country was able\r\nto engage in such a programme of reforms for 18 months in\r\nsuch circumstances. We are proud of having succeeded, but\r\nthe economy must be restimulated immediately if we do not\r\nwish to lose all the social and political benefits that were\r\nachieved.\r\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 43\r\nI should like now to take up the problem of the small\r\nisland States, of whose fragility everyone here is aware. We\r\nare countries whose reduced size is the source of\r\ninnumerable constraints on economic and social\r\ndevelopment, such as chronic deficits in trade balances and\r\nbalances of payment, the high cost of social infrastructures\r\nin relation to their utilization and, especially, the excessive\r\nindebtedness caused by a lack of funds to finance investment\r\nprogrammes. The convergence of those factors has only\r\nexacerbated the fragility of our economies, which, generally\r\nspeaking, are based on one or two sectors such as tourism\r\nand fishing.\r\nThat is the daily lot of the Seychelles and other small\r\nisland States, which, with courage, perseverance and\r\nintelligence, are nevertheless attempting to find solutions that\r\nwill enable them to promote the economic and social well-\r\nbeing of their peoples. Thus we believe that it is quite\r\nfitting to draw the international community’s attention once\r\nagain to the need to establish specific programmes and\r\nmechanisms that would make it possible for our island\r\ncountries to move towards sustainable development. We ask\r\nthat the same facilities that are made available to the least\r\ndeveloped, landlocked countries be made available to us.\r\nIn any event, per capita income, always put forward as\r\na criterion for level of development, cannot be relevant for\r\nsmall island States because it is distorted by the small size\r\nof their populations. Has any thought been given to the per\r\ncapita cost of infrastructures or the per capita debt? We\r\nbelieve that such an analysis would result in the\r\nreconsideration of many decisions.\r\nOf course, it is up to us, first of all, to take every\r\nmeasure to ensure the sustainability of our development by\r\npreserving, in so far as possible, our environment, which lies\r\nat the basis of all our export products. Despite all these\r\nconstraints, we have been able - thanks to the judiciousness\r\nof our choices and our economic decisions -\r\nto achieve tangible results. But the international\r\ncommunity’s support, which we had been promised in Rio,\r\ndid not materialize.\r\nToday, all of the developing countries are in a\r\nprecarious situation. They are confronted with many\r\nchallenges: the poverty of millions of human beings, high\r\nrates of infant mortality, famine, the destruction of the\r\nenvironment and fratricidal wars. But these challenges are\r\nnot insurmountable. What is required is courage and\r\ninternational solidarity.\r\nIt is more than ever the duty of the United Nations\r\nonce again to draw the attention of the developed countries\r\nto the effects which the continuation of such a situation\r\nmight have on our economies and our cultures - in a word,\r\non our future, but also on theirs.\r\nWe would like concrete action, because we do not wish\r\nto have to deplore again the inertia of speeches or\r\ndeclarations of intent. While new conflicts arise, the old\r\nones persist almost everywhere and the scope of the disasters\r\nis tremendous. Hence, we must react quickly, because many\r\npeoples have suffered far too much from the horrors of war.\r\nAbove all, the major Powers, the guarantors of the\r\nsecurity and regulation of the world economic situation, must\r\ngive the United Nations the means to carry out its policies.\r\nFinally, we sincerely hope that the current session will\r\ngenerate the necessary impetus to resolve all our concerns,\r\nso that peace, at last restored, can create a climate conducive\r\nto development.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.20 p.m.\r\n"
