"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n12th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nFriday, 1 October 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.35 a.m.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. CHEDDI B. JAGAN, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF GUYANA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Cooperative Republic of\r\nGuyana.\r\nMr. Cheddi B. Jagan, President of the Republic of\r\nGuyana, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the distinct honour to welcome to the\r\nUnited Nations the President of the Cooperative Republic of\r\nGuyana, His Excellency Dr. Cheddi Jagan, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident JAGAN: As I stand today at this rostrum, a\r\nflood of memories rushes to my mind. I recall appearing as\r\nPremier before the United Nations Committee on\r\ndecolonization in 1961 to plead the case of my country’s\r\nindependence. Like so many other colonies after the Second\r\nWorld War, Guyana was anxious to secure its freedom and\r\nexercise its right to self-determination.\r\nThe road, however, was far from easy. Along the way\r\nthere were many stumbling-blocks and casualties. It was not\r\nuntil 1966, long after most subject peoples had been set free,\r\nthat we became independent and took our place in the family\r\nof nations.\r\nThe world today is radically different from what it was\r\nthen. The total membership of the United Nations has\r\ngrown significantly. The cold war, which had bedevilled\r\ninternational relations since 1947, has ended, with a promise\r\nof a new and more democratic world order. With the\r\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, one of the two super-Powers,\r\nthere are severe difficulties for the new structures which\r\nhave been established. Nevertheless, hope is alive for the\r\nconstruction of an era of peace, based on respect for all\r\npeoples and the promotion of their general welfare. It is an\r\nexciting moment in world history, and for the United\r\nNations there is a defining role.\r\nGuyana has been honoured by the unanimous election\r\nof its representative to the presidency of this forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. This session will\r\nundoubtedly be a challenging one. I wish to thank the entire\r\nmembership for its vote of confidence in our ability to\r\nundertake this lofty responsibility. It is, after all, an\r\nacknowledgement that all States, irrespective of their size,\r\ncan play an important role in the Organization’s work. I am\r\nespecially grateful to the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) group and the wider Latin American and\r\nCaribbean Group for their full endorsement of our\r\ncandidacy. I must also pay a tribute to His Excellency Mr.\r\nStoyan Ganev for his capable direction of the forty-seventh\r\nsession and to our distinguished Secretary-General for his\r\nefforts to promote the continuing success of our world\r\nOrganization.\r\nSuccess in these volatile times is often tempered. For,\r\nnotwithstanding its important accomplishments, the United\r\nNations cannot be said to have fulfilled the highest\r\naspirations of its creators. The scourge of war is still\r\nrampant in many places. Colonialism is certainly not extinct,\r\nand today it threatens to survive in different forms. Many\r\naspects of colonialism are evident in the ever-widening gap\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86701 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.12\r\n19 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nbetween the developed and the developing countries and the\r\ndependence of impoverished millions on the largesse of a\r\nfew. This prevailing economic and social disparity provides\r\na breeding ground for hunger, disease and poverty and\r\nultimately constitutes a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nAs the focal point of multilateralism, the United\r\nNations must continue to explore the full limits of\r\ninternational cooperation in order to eliminate, or at least\r\nalleviate, the problems of the disadvantaged. I should like\r\nto think that there is now agreement that the grave situation\r\nrequires collective action. Whatever its limitations, it is still\r\nthe best forum available to States for diplomacy, dialogue\r\nand negotiation, and thus for the avoidance of conflict. We\r\nshould seek, therefore, to enhance its ability to address our\r\ncommon goals.\r\nAs a small developing State, Guyana is fully committed\r\nto the ethos of multilateral cooperation which is embodied\r\nin the United Nations. We have come here to renew\r\npublicly our faith in the Organization and to urge all\r\nMembers to pledge to deepen and strengthen multilateralism\r\nas a foundation for inter-State relations. Experience has\r\nshown that no nation, however powerful, can exist in\r\nisolation. Its borders are not impervious to encroachment by\r\nuniversal ills. Ultimately, it must come together with the\r\nrest of the world to find common solutions to common\r\nproblems. AIDS, narcotic drugs, poverty and pollution are\r\nstriking examples of the pandemic which affects us all.\r\nControl of these scourges requires concerted action by the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole. Added to these are natural\r\ndisasters, such as the recent earthquake in India. Our\r\ndeepest sympathy goes out to the Indian people and\r\nGovernment.\r\nWe note with some disappointment that international\r\nconflicts continue to undermine the capacity of the\r\nOrganization to promote the cooperation which is deemed\r\nessential for reaching solutions to current global problems.\r\nThe real value of the United Nations in this period will\r\ndepend on its collective ability to respond effectively to this\r\nwave of international conflicts, and to find acceptable means\r\nof peace-keeping and peacemaking which will not be a\r\nburden on its membership.\r\nSuch a development will inspire confidence among\r\nmember nations to refer issues to the United Nations body,\r\nand to restore their reliance on the Organization’s ability to\r\nresolve disputes before they resort to the battlefield.\r\nOur first effort at constructing a framework for\r\ninternational peace and security through the League of\r\nNations ended in failure. The reason can be found in the\r\ninherent weakness of the League, in the resultant inability to\r\ncontain rampant nationalism, particularism and insularity and\r\nin the lack of respect for its fundamental principles. The\r\nUnited Nations is a second experiment, prompted by the\r\ndisasters consequent upon the failure of the League. At San\r\nFrancisco we vowed to spare succeeding generations from\r\nthe scourge of war. We have before us today another\r\nopportunity to secure an era of real peace and stability, to\r\ndeploy fully the resources of the Organization in the service\r\nof humanity, and to reach for a broad-based, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and some measure of prosperity and fulfilment\r\nfor the peoples of this planet.\r\nIn our efforts to bolster international peace and security,\r\nthe report, \"An Agenda for Peace\", which was prepared by\r\nthe Secretary-General in response to the Security Council’s\r\nrequest, sets out a number of proposals which merit serious\r\nconsideration. While recognizing the need to provide the\r\nCouncil with enforcement capacity under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter, we place special importance on preventive\r\ndiplomacy, which would obviate recourse to physical\r\nintervention. As the experience of some recent peacemaking\r\nand peace-keeping operations has shown, these measures are\r\nfraught with uncertain political consequences. Moreover,\r\nthey have proved extremely costly, particularly to small\r\nStates such as ours which can ill afford such expenditures.\r\nSo diverse are the origins of conflict that each situation\r\nmust be examined in depth to determine the most\r\nappropriate means of peaceful solution. In some cases the\r\ndispute may have legal implications and may therefore be\r\nbest handled by a suitable judicial body. More often than\r\nnot, however, the roots of conflict are embedded in a history\r\nof complicated political, economic and social factors. In\r\nsuch instances the ground must be carefully prepared for the\r\ncultivation of peace and stability. Fortunately, the\r\nadvantages of the diplomatic approach are not lost in the\r\nUnited Nations, which increasingly is using the good offices\r\nof the Secretary-General and his representatives to induce\r\nsolutions to long-standing conflicts.\r\nWe believe that these examples reaffirm the virtue of\r\ndialogue and negotiation. However, although promising for\r\nthe future, other situations remain tenuous and require\r\nconstant monitoring. Somalia and Sudan must be carefully\r\nnurtured back to normalcy. In Europe, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina stands out as an horrific example of man’s\r\ninhumanity to man, and compels us to search for a quick end\r\nto the wanton killing of innocent thousands. Indeed, the\r\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 3\r\nUnited Nations must hasten to devise new strategies to deal\r\nwith these persistent convulsions in the global body politic.\r\nThe Middle East has been embroiled in conflict for\r\nmuch too long. With the recent signing of the declaration of\r\nprinciples for Palestinian self-rule, the road ahead is\r\nencouraging. Peace and stability throughout the region now\r\nseem to be within our grasp. We hope also that the\r\nterritorial problems between Iraq and Kuwait can be\r\namicably settled.\r\nAs far as South Africa is concerned, the announcement\r\nof a date for elections, coupled with supporting structures,\r\ngives rise to the hope that majority rule is not far off and we\r\nmay in the near future welcome that country back into the\r\nfold of the international community. We urge the peoples of\r\nSouth Africa to eschew further violence and to come\r\ntogether for their common good.\r\nI wish to record with satisfaction the view that a return\r\nto democratic traditions and respect for good governance and\r\nhuman rights has helped to further promote peace. Guyana\r\nwill support any confidence-building mechanism which\r\nfavours dialogue over confrontation as the means of choice\r\nfor the pacific settlement of disputes. Because of the\r\ninherent correlation between peace and development it\r\nbehoves each member of the international community to\r\ncontinue the search, where needed, for creative ways to\r\nsettle disputes that could otherwise imperil not only\r\ninternational peace and security but also national\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn this hemisphere, of which Guyana forms part, we are\r\nconcerned that, despite the end of the cold war, Cuba\r\nremains outside the inter-American family. We truly believe\r\nthat this is a serious anomaly in the context of the\r\nOrganization’s efforts to build a new world order based on\r\nmutual understanding and respect among all States in a\r\nunited international community. We appeal to the United\r\nStates and Cuba to demonstrate their good will and seek\r\nurgently to reconcile their long-standing differences. The\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM), which has a vested\r\ninterest in the early rapprochement between these two major\r\npartners, stands ready to play a role in this process.\r\nWe are particularly pleased that the Central American\r\nregion, which for far too long has been entrapped by\r\nanachronistic economic and social structures, has emerged\r\nfrom a vicious cycle of internecine violence. CARICOM\r\nwelcomes the opportunity which this development offers for\r\ncloser cooperation between two neighbouring regions. We\r\nare equally pleased that, after being held hostage by a\r\nmilitary dictatorship unwilling to heed the popular will, Haiti\r\nis once again free to pursue a democratic path. We offer to\r\nPresident Aristide and his government our ready cooperation\r\nin the urgent task of reconstruction for social progress.\r\nGuyana has itself only recently emerged from a difficult\r\nelectoral process that, under international vigilance, proved\r\nto be free and fair. We are particularly grateful for the role\r\nthe United Nations played in ensuring that the democratic\r\nwill of our people was fully respected. After all, the right\r\nto choose one’s government is a fundamental human right,\r\nwhich should never be denied. We commend the United\r\nNations for providing electoral assistance at the request of\r\nthose who seek it, and with due respect for the principle of\r\nnational sovereignty. Elections alone, however, do not\r\nguarantee the preservation of democracy: they must be\r\naccompanied by the establishment of machinery that protects\r\nevery individual in our societies. I am pleased to report that\r\none of the first steps my Government took upon assuming\r\noffice was to accede to the Optional Protocol to the United\r\nNations Human Rights Covenants. We followed that with\r\nthe establishment of an Inter-Agency High-Level Committee\r\non Human Rights, whose function it is to ensure that Guyana\r\ncomplies with its reporting responsibilities under the Human\r\nRights Conventions.\r\nIt is not enough, however, to satisfy the civic and\r\npolitical rights of our citizens: their fundamental economic\r\nand social entitlements to food, clothing, shelter and so on\r\nmust also be provided. Human rights are indivisible, and to\r\nprefer one above the other is to deny their essential\r\ninterrelatedness. The Vienna Conference appears to have\r\nrecognized this fact and to have confirmed the need for a\r\nholistic approach. My own Government is dedicated to the\r\nproposition that human development must be comprehensive\r\nif our society’s welfare is to be secured. Our stated policy,\r\ntherefore, is to create an environment in which democracy\r\nwill work to fulfil our people’s spiritual and material needs.\r\nTo implement our development programme, however, we\r\nshall require the cooperation of the international community\r\nto supplement our own limited resources.\r\nAs I observed earlier this year at a Conference entitled\r\n\"Poverty in Guyana - Finding Solutions\", we are in a\r\nsituation of crisis. For, while we have recently begun to\r\nexperience high growth rates, the economy continues to be\r\nweak: unemployment is high; human and financial resources\r\nare scarce; and basic infrastructure has deteriorated, leaving\r\nthe social sectors vulnerable to all the ills of poverty. We\r\nhave been somewhat successful in raising production and\r\nproductivity levels, but are seriously limited by a heavy debt\r\nburden. Some 90 cents of each dollar earned now go\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ntowards the repayment of the national debt. And the\r\nproportion of our external commercial earnings for payment\r\nof our foreign debt is nearly three times the average of the\r\n47 least developed countries - an unbearably heavy burden.\r\nEven though we attempt to manage expenditure judiciously,\r\nthrough good governance - efficient management, a clean\r\nand lean administration and fullest respect for human rights -\r\nwe cannot perform miracles. At the end of the day, we must\r\nlook for assistance to buttress our domestic efforts and to\r\npreserve our tender democracy. With nearly 80 per cent of\r\nour people below the poverty line, we shall succeed in\r\nconsolidating democracy only through economic\r\ndevelopment with social justice.\r\nAt the present time, however, the prospects for such\r\nsupport appear rather bleak. There has been a noticeable\r\ncontraction in development aid as the economies of some\r\ndonor countries experience difficulties. Their own\r\nelectorates appear increasingly concerned with domestic\r\nproblems, such as unemployment and falling living\r\nstandards. Whatever limited resources are available are\r\nallocated by the developed nations largely on the basis of\r\nstrategic concerns. The international agenda is therefore\r\nbeing set more and more at the sacrifice of the developing\r\nworld. There is consequently an urgent need to reorder our\r\npriorities and to place development at the top of our agenda.\r\nAt best, however, development aid is no more than a\r\npalliative. Significant economic and social progress will\r\ncome to the developing countries only when inequitable and\r\nunjust economic and trade practices in the global system are\r\nremoved. As the 1992 human development report pointed\r\nout, we are denied some $500 billion in market opportunities\r\nannually, 10 times what we receive as foreign assistance,\r\nprimarily because of protectionist policies still being pursued\r\nby the developed countries. We call, therefore, on those\r\ncountries to open up their markets to our goods at prices that\r\ncompensate us fairly for our labour and production. In this\r\ncontext, we urge the industrial nations to expedite the\r\nconclusion of trade negotiations, taking fully into account the\r\ninterests of our small, developing economies. We would\r\nalso wish and ask that the formation of large regional\r\neconomic groupings - the megablocs as they are called -\r\nguard against the further marginalization of our economies\r\nand our countries.\r\nAdditionally, a definite solution must be found, during\r\nthe current decade, to the third world’s crushing external\r\ndebt problem. In Latin America and the Caribbean, with\r\n181 million out of 441 million people living below the\r\npoverty line, in the mire of destitution, how can human\r\ndevelopment take place when, despite onerous debt\r\npayments, the stock of debt continues to grow? A\r\nprospective Economic Commission for Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean (ECLAC) study for the region over the\r\n1985-1995 period shows a serious aggravation in terms of\r\npoverty, unemployment and foreign debt during the decade.\r\nBetween 1981 and 1990, the region’s foreign debt payments\r\nwere $503 billion, of which $313 billion were interest\r\npayments. However, in the same period, the region’s\r\nconsolidated foreign debt increased from $297 billion in\r\n1981 to $428 billion in 1991. Little wonder that the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) publication entitled\r\n\"Children of the Americas\" commented that this mechanism,\r\nwhereby the more you pay the more you owe, is perverse\r\nand must be stopped.\r\nDebt relief in the form of debt cancellation, grants, soft\r\nloans and rescheduling is urgent if the developing countries\r\nare to eradicate poverty, protect the environment and play a\r\nmeaningful role in expanding world trade and ending\r\nstagnation and recession in the industrially developed\r\ncountries. Debt relief must be seen as an investment not\r\nonly in the development of poor countries but also in the\r\nsecurity of the rich nations.\r\nRecognizing the link that exists between poverty, trade,\r\npopulation, development and the environment, we must\r\nhasten to implement the Rio programme of action outlined\r\nin Agenda 21. The developing countries urgently require the\r\nresources - both financial and technological - necessary to\r\nfulfil their obligations under that compact. As proof of its\r\ncommitment to protect the environment, Guyana has set\r\naside nearly 1 million acres of its tropical forests for\r\nresearch, management and development of our rich\r\nbiodiversity. With the welcome of entities such as the\r\nCommonwealth Secretariat, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and the Global Environment Facility, the\r\nIwokrama project, as it is now known, has been fully\r\nlaunched. At the commissioning ceremony held on World\r\nEnvironment Day this year, I dedicated the enterprise to our\r\nindigenous peoples, who are not only the principal\r\ninhabitants but also the custodians of our forests. It is\r\nfitting, especially in this, the International Year of the\r\nWorld’s Indigenous People, that full recognition be given to\r\nthe important role they play in harmonizing man’s\r\nrelationship with the Earth on which he lives.\r\nWe also urge full support for the Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, scheduled to commence in Barbados in April 1994.\r\nWe trust that there will be adequate preparation and the\r\nwidest participation in that Conference.\r\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 5\r\nIn a spirit of genuine cooperation, therefore, let us\r\nproceed to address the proposed agenda for development,\r\nwhich we have accepted as a natural concomitant to \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\". Indeed, peace cannot prevail in the\r\nabsence of development. Our attempts at peacemaking and\r\nconflict resolution in general will not succeed if inequitable\r\nand unjust economic and social conditions are allowed to\r\npersist. Of late, many of the organs and agencies engaged\r\nin the development process have had cause to lament the\r\ngrowing diminution of resources available to them, a\r\nproblem now aggravated by continuing diversion of funding\r\nto a multiplicity of peace-keeping operations. Obviously,\r\none recognizes the importance of maintaining global peace.\r\nHowever, it should not be at the cost of a disproportionate\r\nsacrifice of development, which leads to peace-keeping\r\nbecoming an end in itself instead of a means of encouraging\r\neconomic and social welfare.\r\nThe United Nations, whose universal membership\r\nencompasses both developed and developing nations,\r\nremains the ideal forum for forging a consensus on the\r\nmajor issues of peace and development. It is evident,\r\nhowever, that, as currently conceived and structured, it\r\ncannot adequately perform the role expected of it. That\r\nrealization has led us to undertake the exercise of reforming\r\nand restructuring the Organization. To this end, we must\r\nensure that the changes we make are not simply cosmetic\r\nbut serve effectively to enhance the Organization’s capacity\r\nto deal with the challenges of the post-cold-war period. Our\r\nreforms must therefore seek to establish the United Nations\r\nas the principal forum in which macro-political, economic\r\nand social policies are collectively and consensually devised.\r\nIf truth be told, the United Nations is still largely\r\nperceived, notwithstanding its recent successes in the\r\npolitical field, as a \"talk shop\". Like the old Congress of\r\nVienna, which was described as a \"perpetual dance\", it is\r\nviewed in the eyes of our peoples - particularly the poor and\r\nthe suffering - as an endless round of dilatory debate which\r\nproduces fine resolutions but precious little by way of\r\nconcrete action. To survive and succeed, therefore, the\r\nUnited Nations must become relevant to the lives of men,\r\nwomen and children everywhere.\r\nUrgent action is required at this explosive period of\r\nmounting external debt, falling economic growth, falling\r\nthird-world commodity prices, increasing unemployment,\r\nenvironmental destruction, underdevelopment and the\r\npersistence of poverty. Our troubled planet calls for\r\nstatesmanship, political will and cooperation for meaningful\r\nchange. Market forces alone are not providing the people\r\nwith adequate opportunities to participate in and benefit from\r\neconomic growth and development. We have a paradox of\r\ngrowing poverty in the midst of potential plenty. Science\r\nand technology have the capacity to eradicate poverty in the\r\nnot too distant future and to halve it by the end of the\r\ncentury. Instead, we have today, both in the developed and\r\nin the developing countries, only about half the growth rate\r\nof a decade ago and the catastrophic phenomenon of \"jobless\r\ngrowth\" - fewer and fewer jobs and more and more poverty\r\nand inequality.\r\nIt is necessary to ascertain the root causes of global\r\npoverty and to develop an integrated strategy for its\r\neradication. This necessitates a comprehensive world view\r\nand a recognition of the major contradiction of our time: the\r\ntremendous growth of the means of production and the\r\nanachronistic relations of production and the collective will\r\nto resolve this contradiction.\r\nIn the intense competition in a shrinking global\r\nmarket - owing in large part to the increasing poverty and\r\nthe widening gap between the rich and poor in both the\r\nNorth and South, and between the North and the South - the\r\nthree centres of the industrialized world - North America,\r\nWestern Europe and Japan - are resorting to even more\r\ncapital-intensive growth and the use of more and more\r\nsophisticated technology: computers and robots, cybernetics\r\nand automation. How can the poor and unsophisticated in\r\nthe third-world countries survive in the \"global village\", in\r\nthe \"borderless world\" when collectively these countries have\r\nnot attained the target projected long ago of 25 per cent in\r\nthe production of industrialized goods and with the great\r\nmajority light-years behind in human-resource development\r\nand burdened by the dead weight of unconscionable and\r\nimmoral debt payments? The rapid advance to robots and\r\nautomation in the North also poses a threat to the\r\nadvantageous position of competitive wage rates in many\r\ncountries of the South. And the industrialized countries with\r\nbudget deficits, growing numbers of jobless and retirees and\r\ninadequate welfare funds cannot afford the Keynesian luxury\r\nof pump-priming and \"workfare\".\r\nIn a situation of confusion and uncertainty, and with no\r\nsolution in sight, the reactionary ultra-rightists and\r\nneo-fascists are getting stronger politically and becoming\r\nmore vocal and strident. There is no answer to the\r\nhopelessness and despair of the more than 30 million\r\nunemployed in the countries of the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development. Despair is leading\r\nto alcoholism, narcotics use, crime and suicide. Meanwhile\r\nnationalism, xenophobia and neo-fascism are on the rise,\r\nleading to racial and ethnic tensions and growing civil strife.\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe North-South dialogue has been languishing and has\r\nbecome a dialogue of the deaf. In the South, rising\r\nunemployment and abject poverty are interacting with rapid\r\npopulation growth, urbanization, overcrowding, disease, the\r\nproduction and use of narcotic drugs, increased flows of\r\nrefugees across international frontiers and irreversible\r\ndamage to the environment. Whereas it was said previously\r\nthat the Berlin Wall prevented peoples in the Soviet Union\r\nand Eastern Europe from travelling to the West, now new\r\nwalls are being erected to prevent people from entering the\r\ndeveloped, industrialized countries.\r\nIt is not enough to treat the symptoms of the global\r\nmalaise. Radical reforms are urgently needed. Structural\r\nadjustment is as necessary for the developed countries as for\r\nthe developing countries, but reforms must be predicated on\r\nsocial justice and have a human face. Human needs and\r\nhuman security should be the object of development. In this\r\nregard, greater emphasis must be placed on human capital\r\nand natural capital, and much more must be done to speed\r\nup disarmament so that the despairing and hungry of the\r\nworld can benefit from greatly enhanced savings.\r\nThe development agenda must include a critical analysis\r\nof possible options and must deal with the international\r\ncompetitiveness of the third world, the basis of new\r\nmodalities of international cooperation for development and\r\nthe financing of development. It must also address core\r\nproblems: alleviation of poverty, expansion of productive\r\nemployment and enhancement of social integration,\r\nparticularly of the more disadvantaged and marginal groups.\r\nTo attain these objectives, the people - I repeat, the\r\npeople - must play a central role. They must be fully\r\ninvolved in all aspects of life to take advantage of their\r\ninitiatives and creativity in the fashioning of a better future\r\nand a peaceful and prosperous world.\r\nAs the leader of a small nation which continues to\r\nbelieve in the vast potential of this Organization for making\r\nthe world a better place in which to live, I appeal to the\r\nAssembly to devote itself to this urgent task. Let us work\r\ntogether to advance the cause of global peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Cooperative\r\nRepublic of Guyana for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Cheddi B. Jagan, President of the Republic of\r\nGuyana, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. ALBERTO FUJIMORI,\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC\r\nOF PERU\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru.\r\nMr. Alberto Fujimori, Constitutional President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the Constitutional President\r\nof the Republic of Peru, His Excellency\r\nMr. Alberto Fujimori, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident FUJIMORI (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIn 1990 the Peruvian people - heirs to an ancient culture,\r\nwho, like other peoples of the third world, suffered the\r\nconsequences of colonialism and later various frustrations\r\ncaused by our history - began to ask themselves more and\r\nmore why they had not reached a truly dignified level of\r\nexistence comparable to that of the developed countries.\r\nWhy was it that a rich nation, known for its\r\nhard-working population and enjoying apparent democracy,\r\nshould have to suffer from hyperinflation, isolation from the\r\ninternational financial community, terrorism, drug-trafficking,\r\ncorruption and internal and external debt? In short, why was\r\nit ungovernable?\r\nThe so-called traditional democracy, which solved none\r\nof Peru’s serious problems, had been nothing more than a\r\nstruggle between privileged minorities, the elite and party\r\nleaders who took turns in power while the country sank\r\ndeeper and deeper into misery.\r\nNations, however, do not disintegrate in such crises;\r\nrather, they are roused to carry out moral and material\r\nreconstruction. Such has been the case in Peru.\r\nI ask myself, and I ask all those present, the\r\nrepresentatives of all the nations of the world, \"Which is the\r\nfirst priority: the narrow, blind defence of an institutional\r\nformality that is now worthless and obsolete, or a better\r\ndestiny for millions of human beings?\"\r\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 7\r\nWe in Peru have experienced this disjunction which the\r\nGovernment of President Boris Yeltsin in Russia is\r\nexperiencing so dramatically today.\r\nWhy should we fear making corrections in the course\r\nof our history, however radical they may be? To govern is\r\nto confront problems firmly, and not to defer, much less to\r\nevade, decisions.\r\nIn exceptional circumstances, when the civilized\r\nexistence and survival of a nation is at stake, each country\r\nhas to find its own course and its own solutions and then\r\nreconstruct its democracy in touch with its own reality.\r\nFailing this, it will simply become ungovernable - a situation\r\nthat most often leads to anarchy, which in turn inevitably\r\ngenerates violence.\r\nThe institutions of Peru’s incipient political system\r\nproved to be among the most inefficient on the continent.\r\nThat was the context within which Shining Path and the\r\nTupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement came into existence.\r\nThe model for Shining Path is Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge.\r\nThis is why, for 10 years, that group’s activities were\r\ndirected toward destroying the existing system: industries,\r\nlaboratories, electrical towers, machinery, bridges, highways\r\nand public buildings, costing the country US$ 25 billion in\r\nmaterial damages and losses. New York learned what\r\nterrorist insanity is all about with the criminal attack on the\r\nWorld Trade Center - an isolated case, thank goodness.\r\nWe had reached a clear and elemental disjunction:\r\neither we stopped the crisis and the terrorism which steadily\r\nnourished it, or the country would collapse completely. My\r\nresponsibility was to govern, not to serve as Peru’s undertaker.\r\nOur anti-terrorist strategy has led to the reinstatement\r\nof the principle of authority throughout the country,\r\nparticularly in places as dissimilar as state universities and\r\npenitentiaries.\r\nAfter being captured a year ago, Abimael Guzmán\r\nmade a fiery proclamation to all his followers to continue\r\nrelentlessly the war against the Peruvian State and its\r\nsociety. Today, in a 180-degree turn, he appeals to your\r\nspeaker, the President of Peru, in order to retract his\r\nprevious atrocious objectives. This shows essentially that he\r\nhas inevitably come to terms with the total defeat of his\r\ntotalitarian project.\r\nIn fact, I recently received a revealing communication\r\nfrom the leader of Shining Path, Abimael Guzmán, who is\r\nin jail, in which he asked for \"a peace agreement\". I repeat,\r\nAbimael Guzmán Reynoso has asked the President of Peru\r\nto talk about a \"peace agreement\". But a \"peace agreement\"\r\nimplies negotiation between two belligerent groups\r\nconsidered to be equal - equal not only militarily but also\r\nfrom a moral and ethical standpoint. This is inadmissible,\r\nfor there can be no negotiations with a genocidal terrorist group -\r\ndescribed as such by the United Nations itself - whose\r\nleader, having been captured, tried and sentenced last year\r\nto life imprisonment, has absolutely no power to negotiate.\r\nMoreover, there is no correlation of forces between the\r\nPeruvian State and these criminals that could put them on an\r\nequal footing. There can be no doubt that it has been\r\ncompletely recognized that the State, the Armed Forces, the\r\nNational Police and the people of Peru are prevailing over\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe Government of Peru is fully aware of its obligation\r\nto respect the international principles of the Geneva\r\nConvention. Nevertheless, it will make no concession in any\r\nway that would jeopardize the process of restoring peace\r\ncompletely to Peru. Through the attainment of peace in our\r\ncountry and the definitive eradication of terrorism, we are\r\nalso preventing the spread of terrorism to the rest of the\r\nSouthern Cone of our continent.\r\nThe Peruvian Government and its people will tirelessly\r\ncontinue their effort to fight terrorist violence, with or\r\nwithout requests from the heads of these organizations. If\r\nthey really wish peace to be achieved as soon as possible,\r\nthey should immediately and unconditionally stop terrorist\r\nactions and their methods of propagation, as a preliminary\r\nstep enabling the Peruvian State to prevent further bloodshed\r\nand suffering for the Peruvian people and to take the further\r\nsteps required to facilitate the process by which the\r\nGovernment will fully consolidate national peace before the\r\ndate I promised to my fellow citizens, that is, 1995.\r\nTwenty-five thousand deaths; hundreds of thousands of\r\nrefugee peasants displaced from their villages; thousands of\r\nwidows and orphans; hundreds of handicapped and maimed,\r\nincluding civilian, police and military; thousands of children\r\nwho have grown up in the middle of a cruel war; $25 billion\r\nof material waste; an entire country paralysed by terror and\r\nuncertainty: this is the sum of 13 fateful years, during\r\nwhich a State considered to be democratic appeared not to\r\nexist in the face of totalitarian terror. The end of this\r\nvicious circle is approaching after 17 months - barely 17 months -\r\nof the counter-terrorist strategy developed by my\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nGovernment. Now we can talk about the State and\r\ndemocracy in Peru.\r\nIn our country, a new and exemplary democracy is\r\nbeing devised. It has some unusual elements: the common\r\nman’s awareness of his chronic exclusion from the\r\nmainstream of civic life; his experience and sacrifice as a\r\nsurvivor of one of the century’s worst economic crises; and\r\nhis equally successful involvement in the war against the\r\nnation’s terrorist threat - within the framework of the full\r\nexercise of his right to self-defence and the universal rights\r\nof the individual and of every citizen.\r\nPeru can once again see the light of day. The\r\nnightmare of war is now behind us. Those who doubted that\r\nthis was possible must now admit that it has happened and\r\nmust recognize that the decisions taken in April 1992 were\r\nabsolutely necessary. Peru is beginning to be a viable\r\ncountry again - an attractive country visited by thousands of\r\ntourists, who can confidently bear witness to its new look,\r\na country with hope, one into which foreign capital is\r\nflowing, thereby generating more employment and wealth.\r\nIn the near future, the Peruvian people will have the historic\r\nopportunity to decide upon a constitution incorporating the\r\nthoroughgoing reforms that will guarantee peace and\r\nprogress in our country. This will be the end of a grim\r\ncycle. Peru is now a country open to the world - one which,\r\nlike other countries all over the planet, is beginning fully to\r\nexercise its right to be a free and prosperous nation through\r\nthe implementation of a true democracy and of a system of\r\ngovernment that will benefit our people.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nConstitutional President of the Republic of Peru for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alberto Fujimori, Constitutional President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. OCHOA ANTICH (Venezuela) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): Allow me, on behalf of Venezuela, to extend\r\nto you, Sir, our very special congratulations on your election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession. It is of great significance to us that the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Guyana - a country with which we\r\nmaintain special relations of friendship and cooperation -\r\nshould be directing the work of this important Assembly.\r\nThe President of Venezuela, Mr. Ramon J. Velásquez, would\r\nhave liked to be present on this important occasion.\r\nHowever, the current situation in the country necessitates his\r\nremaining in Caracas.\r\nIn recent months Venezuela has had to assume\r\nexceptional responsibilities. Yesterday marked the end of\r\nour term as president of the Security Council. During that\r\nterm, events of vital importance have taken place in the\r\nworld. In particular, during the past 12 months we have\r\nwitnessed with horror the re-emergence of hatreds, barbarism\r\nand episodes of ethnic cleansing that we thought had been\r\nconsigned for ever to the saddest and blackest pages of\r\nhistory. In the conflict that is tearing apart the former\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, Venezuela has played an important\r\nrole - a role widely recognized by the other members of the\r\nCouncil - in the protection of human rights. Acting within\r\nthe framework of the international bodies, we have sought,\r\nabove all, to restore peace to that tormented region.\r\nThe United Nations has accumulated a wealth of\r\nexperience in the deployment of operations for the\r\nmaintenance of order - even in some situations in which\r\npeace had not yet been attained. With the new situation in\r\nthe world, an organization that was established for purposes\r\nof dialogue and negotiation is faced with challenges of a\r\ndifferent kind. From the maintenance of order in a\r\ntraditional sense, it has moved on to operations that include\r\nmilitary aspects, humanitarian, institutional and electoral\r\nassistance, the monitoring of human-rights issues and even\r\ndevelopment aid. In recent months the United Nations has\r\nplayed an active and varied role against an ever-changing\r\ninternational background.\r\nThis year, too, the world has seen the emergence of new\r\nhopes. In one of the most strife-torn regions of the planet,\r\nwhere there appeared to be no prospect of understanding or\r\nfuture coexistence, two old enemies, the State of Israel and\r\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization, have taken significant\r\nsteps towards a joint search for peace and the harmonious\r\ndevelopment of the two peoples. Venezuela welcomes the\r\nWashington agreement between Israel and the PLO, and will\r\nwork within the framework of the United Nations to achieve\r\na body of measures and resolutions that will help to erase\r\nthe hatreds of a past that is still too close. Similarly, we\r\nsupport the peace initiatives and the process of\r\ndemilitarization and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons\r\nthat have always been an essential part of the work of this\r\nAssembly.\r\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 9\r\nDuring our months on the Security Council, we have\r\nexperienced, at first hand, the accelerated pace of world\r\nevents today. We are concerned at the uncertainty of the\r\nroads to be taken and the instability that prevails in many\r\ncorners of the world. There are no longer any ideologies,\r\nestablished values or clear directions. Nevertheless, amidst\r\nall the confusion a few issues have emerged which could\r\nbecome the single prevalent ideology of mankind. These are\r\nhuman rights, the defence of democracy and the protection\r\nof the environment.\r\nLast June, in Vienna, the United Nations sponsored that\r\nremarkable encounter, the World Conference on Human\r\nRights. We engaged there in a fruitful dialogue between\r\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations, with the\r\naim of working together to wipe out the injustices that still\r\nexist in our countries. In Vienna, we came to realize that\r\nthe protection of human rights has become a topic of interest\r\nto people of different races from all parts of the world. The\r\nConference confirmed the universal value of those rights and\r\nreaffirmed that democracy, human rights and development\r\nare equally important and mutually reinforcing objectives.\r\nThe further improvement of democracy might begin in\r\nthis Organization, where the reform of the Security Council\r\ncontinues to be necessary in order to make its decisions\r\nmore representative. The General Assembly must attach the\r\nproper importance to the discussion of this issue. Venezuela\r\nshares the general concern with making the United Nations\r\na more transparent and democratic Organization. The new\r\ninternational scenario calls for a more representative Security\r\nCouncil without exclusive rights that discriminate against\r\nsome Member States.\r\nIn the context of the defence of democracy, the United\r\nNations and regional organizations have made outstanding\r\nefforts, especially in Haiti, where it is our hope that the\r\nlawfully constituted Government will be restored, and in\r\nGuatemala, where forces attempting a coup d’état were\r\ndefeated by the weight of civil society. Today, democratic\r\nregimes prevail in almost all of Latin America. However,\r\nour democracies are still young and have experienced\r\ndifficulties in recent months.\r\nIn Venezuela, we have overcome a severe political\r\ncrisis which undoubtedly had the result of strengthening our\r\ninstitutions. Following a process which took place entirely\r\nwithin the framework of the law, Mr. Ramón J. Velásquez\r\nsucceeded to the highest office. He is a distinguished\r\nhistorian, respected by all political forces in the country for\r\nthe honesty he has shown in his career and for his profound\r\nknowledge of the Venezuelan mentality.\r\nDemocracy is a system of values within which respect\r\nfor institutions is not only a duty but a necessity. There\r\nhave always been attempts in Latin America to justify the\r\nuse of force. Order, the fight against terrorism or\r\ncommunism, the inefficiency of the State: these reasons\r\nhave often been used to justify regimes that, finally, did not\r\nre-establish order but abolished freedom. In the past, this\r\nhas happened in Venezuela. Today, we have the serenity of\r\nwaiting for our institutions to function, and we can now say\r\nwith pride that democracy persists in Venezuela and that we\r\nhave been able to overcome a serious political crisis.\r\nNevertheless, our future is clouded by economic\r\ndifficulties. The defence and maintenance of democracy\r\nrequires the full cooperation of the industrialized countries\r\nin the search for a form of economic development that will\r\nafford our impoverished peoples a life of dignity. Hence,\r\nwe support the proposal by the President of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. Samuel Insanally, for a summit to discuss the\r\nworld’s economic problems and agree on programmes of\r\naction to solve them. We agree that the \"Agenda for Peace\"\r\np u t f o r w a r d b y t h e S e c r e t a r y - G e n e r a l ,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, should be complemented by an\r\nagenda for development which would place socio-economic\r\nproblems on the same level as those of a purely political\r\nnature. The establishment and preservation of democracy\r\ninvolves reaching a balanced and equitable global growth\r\nrate.\r\nBalanced growth was the central topic of the first\r\nsession of the Commission on Sustainable Development in\r\nNew York. The establishment of that Commission is one of\r\nthe most significant outcomes of the Earth Summit in Rio de\r\nJaneiro. There is an intimate link between the issue of\r\ndevelopment, the financial resources required in order to\r\nattain it and the strict protection of the environment. Despite\r\nthe lack of encouraging results, we still believe firmly in the\r\nRio Declaration on Environment and Development, and we\r\nwish to draw particular attention to Principles 3 and 4, which\r\nread as follows:\r\nPrinciple 3:\r\n\"The right to development must be fulfilled so as to\r\nequitably meet developmental and environmental needs\r\nof present and future generations.\"\r\nPrinciple 4:\r\n\"In order to achieve sustainable development,\r\nenvironmental protection shall constitute an\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nintegral part of the development process and\r\ncannot be considered in isolation from it.\"\r\nAccordingly, we are greatly concerned at what is\r\nhappening on Venezuela’s Amazonian border. My country\r\nhas attached very special importance to the preservation of\r\nnature. Fully 17 per cent of our territory consists of\r\nspecially protected national parks in which economic\r\nactivities are closely monitored and restricted. On the\r\nsouthern border, in particular, we have had the support of\r\nscientific organizations and universities in the establishment\r\nof the Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve, covering\r\nan area of 60,000 square kilometres. In this zone, by law,\r\neconomic activities must be compatible with the fragility of\r\nthe tropical forest ecosystem. Particular importance is\r\nattached to the cultural and linguistic heritage of the\r\nindigenous peoples, whose way of life has always been\r\ncompatible with preservation of the environment.\r\nOver the past five years, unfortunately, we have\r\nundergone a true invasion whose results are disastrous for\r\nthe environment and which has introduced a climate of\r\nviolence hitherto unknown in the area.\r\nThe cause is illegal mining, which, while taking\r\nadvantage of the forested and inaccessible nature of\r\nAmazonia, is destroying rivers and whole hectares of\r\nvegetation. This phenomenon has reached a scale large\r\nenough to cause concern, to the point that it is escaping\r\ncontrol by the States. Just recently - last July - illegal\r\nminers massacred a group of Venezuelans, of the Yanomami\r\ntribe. Brazil and Venezuela, where the criminal act was\r\ncarried out, have established an ad hoc commission to\r\ninvestigate the facts and to make sure that the criminals are\r\npunished. But the fact that these events can occur gives a\r\nclear idea of the seriousness of the situation we are facing in\r\nAmazonia. Trees are being cut down, the sources of our\r\ngreat rivers are being deforested, the waters of the great\r\ntropical forest are being polluted with mercury and the\r\nindigenous population, the original inhabitants of the region,\r\nare being murdered.\r\nThe Amazonian border of Venezuela, 2,200 kilometres\r\nlong, has been preserved. On our side there is the biosphere\r\nreserve, and in Brazil there is the Yanomami park,\r\nestablished in 1992 and covering 94,000 square kilometres.\r\nNevertheless, the deaths of the indigenous Venezuelans show\r\nthat violence and destruction are beginning to penetrate these\r\nprotected areas. Illegal mining is a business behind which\r\nare the gold and diamond transnationals that arm them,\r\nprovide them with machinery and build landing strips in the\r\nforest. They are deforesting Amazonia. Each year an area\r\nof forest the size of Portugal is destroyed. They are wiping\r\nout plants and animals: it is estimated that\r\n1,200,000 species will disappear in the next 25 years. They\r\nare annihilating the local population, and this in 1993, when\r\nthe whole world is commemorating the International Year\r\nfor the World’s Indigenous People.\r\nTherefore, Venezuela addresses the international\r\ncommunity to denounce this serious environmental situation.\r\nAll the countries of the Amazon Basin have clearly\r\nproclaimed our sovereignty over the land in question.\r\nAmazonia belongs to us, but we have the responsibility to\r\nprotect it, now and for future generations. We must work\r\ntogether to preserve our tropical forest. Each country in the\r\nregion is making special efforts to take up the challenge of\r\nsustainable development in this zone where the ecological\r\nbalance is so precarious. We particularly welcome the\r\nestablishment in Brazil of the Ministry of the Environment\r\nand the Conservation of Amazonia, which will undoubtedly\r\nbe an important factor in solving the problem. Only open\r\nand sincere dialogue between the countries of the region will\r\nenable us to resist the gold and diamond multinationals that\r\nare destroying, without regard for morality, this important\r\npart of the heritage of mankind.\r\nWe must live up to the environmental commitments\r\nentered into at the Rio Summit. We need technical support\r\nand political, economic and social backing to confront the\r\neconomic interests that are destroying our heritage. I appeal\r\nto the mining transnationals to understand that development\r\ndoes not mean destruction; to international agencies to help\r\nus implement the principles of sustainable development in\r\nthis zone; and to the wealthiest countries to understand that,\r\nwhile poverty and ignorance persist among large segments\r\nof the population in Latin America, violence and\r\nenvironmental destruction will continue.\r\nThe United Nations has performed a monumental task\r\nin convening the Earth Summit and the Conference on\r\nHuman Rights, and now the major meetings on population\r\nand social development. The resolutions adopted at these\r\nconferences are now being violated in Amazonia. Venezuela\r\nis making a great effort to ensure the preservation of the\r\nenvironment, often in areas to which access is extremely\r\ndifficult. We are fighting for human rights among people\r\nwho are not accustomed to respecting the law. We are\r\ntrying to proceed in accordance with the principles of\r\nsustainable development, standing up to the companies that\r\nare seeking only to extract the wealth of the soil at a rapid\r\npace. These are difficult tasks, but we are convinced that\r\nthis effort is necessary in order to conserve our Amazonia\r\nand preserve it for future generations of our peoples and also\r\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 11\r\nfor future generations of all mankind. The United Nations\r\nis the appropriate forum for the whole world to learn of our\r\nefforts to preserve this territory, its biodiversity and the\r\nintegrity of its rightful inhabitants.\r\nMr. Dinesh SINGH (India): Mr. President, your\r\nunanimous election as President augurs well for the forty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly. I extend my\r\nheartiest congratulations to you and best wishes for success.\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, has\r\ngiven a new vision and a new impetus to the United Nations\r\nat a crucial time in its history. We wish him well in his\r\nefforts.\r\nMy Government is deeply touched by the sympathy and\r\ncompassion expressed by the leaders of several delegations\r\non the devastating earthquake in India on\r\n30 September 1993, and, with your permission,\r\nMr. President, I shall have to go back to India immediately.\r\nThe United Nations will soon be 50 years old. It has\r\nhad many achievements to its credit: decolonization; efforts\r\nto alleviate poverty; peace-keeping; disarmament; devising\r\nan accepted code of international law; respect for human\r\nrights and concern for the environment. I would like to\r\nreiterate India’s faith in and consistent support for the United\r\nNations and its efforts to establish peace and the well-being\r\nof peoples. We take note that the United Nations is trying\r\nto evolve so as to better serve the principles and purposes of\r\nthe Charter. We support the Secretary-General’s efforts to\r\nmake what he has called a transition from the old to the new\r\nUnited Nations, which would be particularly useful and\r\nfruitful for the less developed and less fortunate States.\r\nThe euphoria generated by the end of the cold war has\r\nin the past two years given way to concerns about the\r\ndifficulties of achieving a new global equilibrium and\r\nstability. Essentially, we can see these difficulties arising\r\nfrom the contradictory pulls and pressures exerted by the\r\nforces of positive integration and harmony on the one hand\r\nand fragmentation and discord on the other.\r\nThe end of the divisions of the cold war and the efforts\r\nto halt and reverse the arms race have generated some of the\r\nintegrative forces. Some forces of integration have also been\r\nat work in the global economy, which has been characterized\r\nby the globalization and interdependence of countries’\r\nfactors of production and of issues of trade, money, finance,\r\ntechnology, environment, population and development. The\r\ndesire of the developing countries to participate more\r\nactively in the growth of the world economy and the\r\nbuilding-up of free-market, liberalized economies for\r\nthemselves adds another positive dimension. Issues of\r\ncommon concern and global survival - economic\r\ndevelopment and regeneration, environmental sustainability,\r\ndemographic management, technological dynamism and\r\nhealth for all - have provided a sense of common destiny.\r\nThe communications revolution has resulted in greater\r\ncultural intermingling and openness around the world.\r\nThese forces of integration are, unfortunately, opposed\r\nby those of fragmentation. Represented by sectarian and\r\nsubnational aggression, racism, religious fundamentalism,\r\nbigotry, terrorism, drug trafficking and arms smuggling, they\r\npose a threat to peace, global security, democracy, human\r\nrights and economic and social development. We are also\r\nwitnessing strife, conflicts and cruel, unceasing and irrational\r\ncivil wars in many parts of the world. Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Somalia and Afghanistan cause us anxiety and\r\nconcern. The proliferation of such local conflicts and the\r\never-increasing flow of refugees across national frontiers re-\r\naffirm the truism that peace, like freedom, is indivisible and\r\nthat the disruption of peace anywhere is a danger to peace\r\neverywhere.\r\nThese divisive forces have caused not only political\r\ninstability but also economic collapse in several instances.\r\nConversely, economic sluggishness and lack of development\r\nin several cases have led to political upheavals. Inward-\r\nlooking, exclusivist and narrowly self-centred global\r\neconomic policy-making has been in evidence at a time\r\nwhen the global economy is overshadowed by recession and\r\nlack of dynamism. Macroeconomic coordination is at its\r\nweakest. Protectionist tendencies are strong. The potential\r\nof developing countries to act as vigorous engines of growth\r\nfor revitalizing the world economy stands largely ignored.\r\nIn developing countries, absolute and deepening poverty,\r\nhunger and malnutrition, disease, illiteracy and the lack of\r\nshelter and sanitation for a large portion of the population\r\nhave caused political and social tensions. The structural\r\nimbalances and flaws of the post-Second-World-War\r\ninternational economic order persist and prevent the\r\nmaximization of the benefits of interdependence and\r\nglobalization.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the task of the United Nations\r\nshould be to construct a new global equilibrium by fostering\r\npositive integrative forces and discouraging, if not\r\ncounteracting, the forces of fragmentation and discord. For\r\nthis, the new United Nations will have to reiterate the\r\nfundamental and immutable principles on which it was built:\r\nrespect for the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and\r\nsovereign equality of nation States. I am glad that the\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nSecretary-General stated in his report to the forty-eighth\r\nsession:\r\n\"National sovereignty is the art of rendering\r\nunequal power equal. Without State sovereignty, the\r\nvery instrument of international cooperation might be\r\ndestroyed and international organization might itself\r\nbecome impossible.\" (A/48/1, para. 16)\r\nThe United Nations will have to set an example for the\r\nconduct of relations amongst nation States on the basis of\r\nrespect for the rule of law, democracy and pluralism. Any\r\ninternational framework, whether it be associated with peace\r\nor development, must be transparent and must deal with\r\nissues of global concerns on a non-selective and non--\r\ndiscriminatory basis.\r\nIn the final analysis, the institutions, concepts and\r\nagencies that represent the new world order will be judged\r\nby their ability to harness and channel the beneficial and\r\ncreative forces of integration for the benefit of peace and\r\ndevelopment for all and by the ability of the United Nations\r\nto ensure that the interests of its weaker Member States are\r\nfully reflected therein. In these still perilous times, they\r\nwould have to promote development cooperation and\r\neffectively arrest the plunge into insecurity, strife and chaos,\r\nparticularly when these threaten the very foundation of\r\nMember States, where ultimately the United Nations is\r\nrooted.\r\nThere have been references in this Assembly to all\r\nthese conflicts, big or small, local or with international\r\ndimensions, describing them in the generic terms of ethnic,\r\nreligious and civil wars. The plurality and complexity of our\r\npost-cold-war world do not permit such generic labelling.\r\nNor are these conflicts amenable to generic and instant\r\nremedies. A number of instances of strife or aberrations are\r\npart of the historical legacies inherited by Member States.\r\nEach is posited in a different socio-economic and cultural\r\nmatrix of causation; each is caught up in a different cycle of\r\ncircumstance and violence. The imposition of peace through\r\nunilateral external intervention will only perpetuate situations\r\nembodying the Orwellian logic of \"peace is war\" that we see\r\nin many parts of the world today.\r\nWisdom lies in overcoming conflict situations with a\r\npositive vision animated by peace and amity and in creating\r\nthe necessary confidence and will for peace among countries\r\nand peoples. It is in this spirit that India is ready to initiate\r\na dialogue with Pakistan to build mutual confidence and to\r\npromote a climate of stability in our region. I can only hope\r\nthat Pakistan will respond to this, and have a dialogue with\r\nus, instead of trying to go around the world accentuating\r\ndifferences that will be difficult to resolve later.\r\nWe welcome the recently concluded peace accord\r\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\n(PLO), and earnestly hope that this will be a true harbinger\r\nof further positive developments aimed at establishing lasting\r\npeace and prosperity in West Asia. We also welcome the\r\nannouncement by Mr. Nelson Mandela that irreversible\r\nprogress towards a non-racial, democratic South Africa has\r\nbeen made. In response to his suggestion, India, which had\r\nimposed trade sanctions against South Africa as early as\r\n1946, has initiated action to lift those sanctions and to\r\nnormalize relations with South Africa.\r\nWe trust that the recognition by the Security Council of\r\nthe international boundary between Iraq and Kuwait will\r\ncontribute to the stabilization of the situation in the Gulf\r\nregion. We hope that the faithful implementation of the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions will lead to the\r\nalleviation of the present difficulties of the peoples of the\r\nregion.\r\nIn Somalia, a whole population has gone through a\r\nprotracted civil war and famine with hardly any\r\ngovernmental machinery to tackle the situation. This made\r\nit imperative for the United Nations to act. As an\r\nunprecedented humanitarian mission, the multilateral action\r\nin Somalia enjoyed the support of the entire world, including\r\nthe factional Somali leaders themselves. India, for its part,\r\nhas contributed one of the largest contingents to this mission.\r\nNow that the situation has improved and starvation has been\r\naverted, the United Nations operation faces new problems.\r\nIt is necessary for the United Nations to reassure all sectors\r\nof the people of Somalia about its role in the country,\r\nintensify the process of political reconciliation and adhere\r\nstrictly to the original objectives of the mission.\r\nThe phenomenal increase in peace-keeping operations\r\nin the post-cold-war period and their inclusion as an element\r\nof the new agenda for peace is at once a matter of comfort\r\nand concern. It is a matter of comfort because the United\r\nNations at long last has started playing its Charter role in the\r\narea of peace and security. In the altered international\r\npolitical environment, we would like the United Nations to\r\nrealize its full potential. At the same time, the involvement\r\nof the United Nations on an unprecedented scale with peace-\r\nkeeping operations causes us concern because operationally\r\nthe United Nations is not fully prepared and equipped to\r\ndischarge this role effectively. And, legally and\r\nconceptually, the limits, procedures and rules of the\r\ninvolvement of the United Nations are not clearly defined.\r\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 13\r\nFor peace-keeping operations to be successful, it is\r\nnecessary to follow certain guidelines and criteria. All\r\navenues of pacific settlement of disputes, as laid down in\r\nChapter VI of the Charter, should be fully explored and\r\nexhausted before resorting to peace-keeping operations under\r\nChapter VII. Decisions on such operations should be taken\r\nin a democratic and broad-based manner, and after thorough\r\nconsideration of all aspects. To command universal\r\nendorsement and maintain their non-partisan character,\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations must be based on\r\nthe consent of all the States parties to a dispute. They\r\nshould be undertaken with a specific mandate and a clear\r\ntime-frame. Greater efficiency should be achieved in both\r\nplanning and execution of peace-keeping operations. The\r\nForeign Minister of the Russian Federation, in his address to\r\nthe General Assembly a few days ago, put forward a few\r\nproposals in this respect which merit consideration by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The concept of invoking humanitarian\r\nrelief as a basis for peace-keeping operations may have to be\r\napproached with a great deal of caution and circumspection.\r\nAny new United Nations operation for providing\r\nhumanitarian relief must be completely non-partisan - in fact\r\nand in the perception of the parties involved.\r\nThat consideration must also guide any discussion or\r\ndecision on preventive deployment. The United Nations\r\nmust not allow itself to be burdened indefinitely with\r\nobsolete and ineffective peace-keeping operations. Every\r\npossible measure should be taken to ensure the safety of\r\npeace-keeping personnel.\r\nAnother aspect of the agenda for peace which we\r\nwould like to underline is the particular importance we\r\nattach to Article 50, which enjoins the Security Council to\r\nfind solutions to the special economic problems faced by\r\nthird States on account of the implementation of sanctions\r\nimposed by the Security Council. We call for an automatic\r\nmechanism that would put remedial action in place\r\nsimultaneously with the imposition of sanctions.\r\nAn integral element of any agenda for peace in our\r\ntime is the achievement of disarmament, particularly nuclear\r\ndisarmament. Having endorsed the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention, the United Nations should move on to consider\r\nsimilar steps in other areas of disarmament.\r\nWe welcome the unilateral decision of the United States\r\nto extend its moratorium on nuclear testing until the end\r\nof 1994. The focus of the nuclear-weapon Powers should\r\nnow be on the early conclusion of a universal, verifiable and\r\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty leading to the\r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons.\r\nIndia’s commitment to non-proliferation is complete\r\nand unequivocal. India has an unblemished track record.\r\nIndia’s proposal made in 1988 for an action plan for nuclear\r\ndisarmament within a specific time-frame is of continuing\r\nrelevance in our bid to rid the world of the global scourge\r\nof nuclear weapons. We believe that a new, just and\r\nuniformly applicable regime for non-proliferation which does\r\nnot discriminate between the nuclear-weapon and the\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States should be considered at an early\r\ndate. Such a treaty should place equal obligations on all\r\nStates. For a non-proliferation regime to be truly\r\nmeaningful, it must also address the questions of a\r\nconvention on the non-use of nuclear weapons, a verifiable\r\nfreeze on the production of fissionable material, a total ban\r\non nuclear-weapon tests and negotiations on general and\r\ncomplete disarmament. The global spread and reach of\r\nnuclear weapons reduce to a travesty the objective of\r\nachieving genuine peace and security within a narrow\r\nregional framework. It is our hope that the United Nations\r\nwill take firm action in this direction to achieve this in the\r\nsense I have mentioned.\r\nOne area of concern for developing countries is the\r\nquestion of ad hoc and unilateral export controls and other\r\nrestrictions being placed on the transfer of dual-use and high\r\ntechnology with the ostensible purpose of curbing\r\nproliferation. Non-proliferation concerns must not be made\r\na pretext for denying developing countries access to\r\ntechnologies critical for their development. There is,\r\ntherefore, need to evolve multilateral, non-discriminatory and\r\ntransparent arrangements to regulate the transfer of such\r\ntechnologies so that peaceful uses and dissemination of some\r\nkey technologies are not denied to the developing world.\r\nThere is perhaps merit in convening a special session\r\non disarmament to examine the whole gamut of\r\ndisarmament-related issues that arise in the new context of\r\ntoday. The question of a peace dividend arising from\r\ndisarmament in the form of financial and technical resources\r\nfor the enhancement of international development\r\ncooperation in the context of the United Nations could be\r\none of the issues that special session could address.\r\nIt is obvious that there can be no global security unless\r\ndevelopment is ensured, and we therefore attach as much\r\nimportance to an agenda for development as to the \"Agenda\r\nfor Peace\". Agenda 21 of the Rio Declaration, outlining the\r\nplan and programme for global cooperation in ensuring\r\nsustainable development; the outcome of the Final Act of the\r\neighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade\r\nand Development (UNCTAD VIII), on the partnership for\r\ndevelopment between the North and the South; and the\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nforthcoming Conference on Population and Development, as\r\nwell as the World Summit on Social Development, provide\r\nthe international community enough opportunity to promote\r\neconomic and social development and environmental\r\nsustainability, particularly in developing countries. The work\r\non an agenda for development should build on all these\r\ndevelopment-related action programmes and provide a new\r\nimpetus to development cooperation, both under United\r\nNations auspices and in bilateral and other multilateral\r\ncontexts. Enhancement of the role, resources and\r\ncapabilities of the organs and agencies dealing with\r\ndevelopment in the United Nations system should be\r\nstressed. The United Nations should also be enabled to have\r\na more interactive relationship with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions in a spirit of finding considered and innovative\r\nsolutions to global economic problems and pooling all\r\navailable resources for that purpose.\r\nComprehensive and constructive dialogue between the\r\nNorth and the South and the strengthening of a global\r\npartnership for development are the needs of our times if we\r\nare to avoid the replacement of the East-West divide by a\r\nNorth-South one. India has always participated in the\r\nongoing North-South dialogue through the Group of 77 and\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and in keeping with the\r\nrequirements of a more focused dialogue. India has become\r\npart of the new group of 15 developing countries for\r\nSouth-South consultation and cooperation, the G-15. We are\r\nacting as host to the fourth summit meeting of that group at\r\nNew Delhi in December. Representing the developing\r\ncountries, we have had a promising start through an informal\r\ndialogue with the G-7 and we hope to build on those\r\nbeginnings in a spirit of \"global partnership for global\r\nbenefit\", as was stated by my Prime Minister,\r\nMr. P. V. Narasimha Rao in his message to the\r\nG-7 Chairman.\r\nSome key issues where there is an ongoing dialogue but\r\nwhich none the less need further consideration and\r\nimplementation include: participation of developing\r\ncountries in global macroeconomic coordination and\r\ndecision-making; reciprocation by the North of the efforts of\r\nthe South at restructuring and economic liberalization\r\nthrough the pursuit of expansionist policies conducive to\r\nlong-term growth and opening them up to global competition\r\nin goods, services and manpower through reduction and\r\nelimination of protectionist barriers; increased capital flows,\r\nboth official and private, bilateral and multilateral, to\r\ndeveloping countries to offset the crippling effects of the\r\ndebt burden and to accelerate growth and development; and\r\na balanced, successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round,\r\nwhich should ensure substantial enhancement of market\r\naccess for developing-country exports and of their access to\r\nthe tool of competitiveness.\r\nThe profoundly humanistic traditions of the Indian\r\ncivilization, with its emphasis on tolerance, harmony,\r\nnon-violence and the inviolability of the individual, have\r\nfound their modern expression in the setting up of a\r\ndemocratic, secular and egalitarian polity and society in free\r\nIndia.\r\nBeing the largest practising democracy and effecting a\r\nsynthesis between a multiplicity of ethnic, religious and\r\nlinguistic groups and peoples has been no easy task, as some\r\nin the West are themselves realizing even in the context of\r\ntheir relatively lesser diversities. The Constitution of free\r\nIndia consolidated this humanistic tradition and is indeed a\r\nveritable bill of human rights. A strong and independent\r\njudiciary and a totally free press have also been watchdogs\r\nof democracy and human rights in India.\r\nIndia’s commitment to the effective protection of\r\nhuman rights has now received another institutional impetus\r\nwith the establishment of a National Human Rights\r\nCommission comprised of a retired Chief Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of India, a retired judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt of India, a former Chief Justice of the State High\r\nCourt and other eminent persons as well as the chairmen of\r\nthe three separate national commissions which already exist\r\nto protect the interests of scheduled castes and scheduled\r\ntribes, women and minorities. The Commission has been\r\nmandated to inquire into allegations of violations of human\r\nrights and has been invested with wide-ranging powers,\r\nincluding the power to establish special investigation teams\r\nto carry out effective investigations. The findings of the\r\nCommission are to be published from time to time besides\r\nbeing reflected in its annual report, which will also be laid\r\nbefore Parliament. The law also provides for the\r\nestablishment of human rights commissions by the State\r\nGovernments, on the pattern of the national Commission, as\r\nalso special courts for the speedy trial of cases involving\r\nhuman rights violations.\r\nI am confident that members of the Assembly will\r\naccept that India has established the most appropriate human\r\nrights commission to ensure that there will be full human\r\nrights protection in the country.\r\nOur commitment to universally acceptable\r\nnon-discriminatory norms of human rights and their\r\nprotection and promotion cannot be questioned. It was in\r\nthat spirit that we participated actively in the World\r\nConference on Human Rights, which recognized the\r\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 15\r\nimportance of this issue. We are however pained that not\r\nenough emphasis is put on a major threat and impediment to\r\nthe realization of human rights, namely, terrorism, especially\r\nthe kind that is aided and abetted by one State against\r\nanother. Why is it that a few so-called human rights\r\nadvocates and Member States of the United Nations choose\r\nto focus on the human rights of terrorists - those who\r\nindulge in senseless murder, destruction, pillage, the\r\ndisruption of civilized existence and the undermining of\r\ndemocratic institutions? Why do they virtually turn a blind\r\neye to the violation of the human rights of the victims of\r\nsuch terrorism - innocent civilians or those upholding law\r\nand order and the territorial integrity of States? Can they in\r\ntrue conscience allow terrorists and their supporters to usurp\r\nthe moral high ground on human rights?\r\nThe United Nations will have to take strong action\r\nagainst terrorists because terrorists engage in all kinds of\r\nviolence. They try to upset democratically taken decisions\r\nin a country by using force and killing people. This must be\r\ntotally condemned by the United Nations and stopped\r\ncompletely so that people can live in peace and in\r\ndemocracy and express their views in accordance with the\r\nconstitution of their country.\r\nIn sum, we believe that international cooperation in the\r\nprotection of human rights can succeed only if it is within\r\nthe framework of respect for the sovereignty and integrity of\r\nStates and of a vigorous global programme for anti-terrorist\r\naction. We would, however, like to point out that any\r\nunilateral use of human rights as an instrument of political\r\npressure or intervention, or as an obstacle to trade or a\r\ncondition for development cooperation and aid, in fact serves\r\nthe opposite purpose and impedes the full realization of the\r\nhuman rights of people of affected countries.\r\nThe enhanced role of the United Nations in\r\ninternational affairs calls for the restructuring and redefining\r\nof the functions of its principal organs.\r\nThe responsibilities of the Security Council have grown\r\ndramatically in the past few years, requiring a greater degree\r\nof participation by the overall membership of the United\r\nNations in the Council’s decision-making process. We must\r\nrecognize that the membership of the United Nations has\r\ngrown enormously over the years. A more balanced and\r\nexpanded representation for Member States in the Council is\r\ntherefore inevitable. Unity of purpose among its members\r\nrather than size determines the efficiency of any\r\norganization. The expansion should not be done selectively\r\nor in a piecemeal manner. The principles or criteria of\r\nexpansion of the permanent and non-permanent membership\r\nshould be agreed upon by consensus. For the selection of\r\nadditional States in an expanded Council, the population -\r\nwhich represents the principle of democracy and an element\r\nof power - the size of the economy and the future potential\r\nof the countries concerned should be taken into account,\r\nalong with equitable geographical distribution and the\r\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. There is virtual unanimity among those who have\r\nresponded to the Secretary-General that an expansion of the\r\nCouncil is imperative. Interesting suggestions have been put\r\nforward by several countries. The logical next step would\r\nbe to start a process of consultations to arrive at a suitable\r\nand fair formula that commands universal support.\r\nThe permanent members should be responsive to the\r\naspirations of developing countries represented in the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the basis of equality. It is therefore\r\nessential also to revive the role of the General Assembly, as\r\nwas originally envisaged in the Charter.\r\nWe stand on a decisive threshold incomparable to any\r\nin history, a moment in time when we must bring to bear a\r\nlarger vision and foster the forces of positive integration,\r\ndemocracy and cooperation at national and international\r\nlevels.\r\nMy Prime Minister has, in characterizing the 1990s as\r\nwatershed years in global affairs in the realm of political,\r\neconomic and environmental challenges and changes,\r\nconveyed an unequivocal message:\r\n\"We cannot go wrong if we make coexistence\r\nand peace our watchword, and common universal\r\ngood our objective\".\r\nIt is my Government’s belief that this quest for the common\r\ngood, jointly undertaken, will be central to the success of\r\nour endeavour and for the achievement of the Charter’s\r\nobjective of harmonizing the actions of nations in the\r\nattainment of these common ends.\r\nMr. PAPACONSTANTINOU (Greece): Mr. President,\r\nallow me at the outset to extend to you the warmest\r\ncongratulations of the Greek Government on your election\r\nto the presidency of the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Your distinguished personal qualities and\r\ndiplomatic skills augur well for the progress of work of the\r\ncurrent session.\r\nI should be remiss if I did not express the deep\r\nappreciation of the Greek Government to the\r\nSecre ta ry-Genera l o f the Uni ted Nat ions ,\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the most distinguished way\r\nin which he has been discharging his high duties. His\r\ndynamism, energy, perseverance, political will and\r\nleadership, together with a determined vision of the new\r\nworld structure, constitute invaluable and solid foundations\r\nfor a more efficient and creative United Nations response to\r\nthe challenges of the close of the twentieth century. He has\r\nour full support.\r\nLet me also join previous speakers in welcoming, from\r\nthis rostrum, the new Members that have been admitted to\r\nthe United Nations this year.\r\nWe were deeply shocked by the tragic news of the\r\ndevastating earthquake in India, which has resulted in the\r\nloss of tens of thousands of lives. I express, on behalf of\r\nthe Greek Government and of the Greek people, our sincere\r\nsympathy for the families of victims and for the friendly\r\npeople of India.\r\nEarlier this week, the Foreign Minister of Belgium, in\r\nhis capacity as President of the Council of the European\r\nCommunity, delivered a statement on behalf of the European\r\nCommunity and its 12 member States. My Government\r\nfully subscribes to its content.\r\nAn unprecedented and historic event has enhanced\r\nhopes for the peoples living in the Middle East. Israelis and\r\nPalestinians have made a courageous step, in Washington,\r\ntowards peace. Greece, together with its European\r\nCommunity partners, offers its full support for keeping the\r\npresent momentum so that the parties involved may soon\r\nreach comprehensive and lasting agreements. We have\r\nalways taken the stand that peace in the Middle East could\r\nbe achieved through direct dialogue between all the parties.\r\nThe Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Mitsotakis, addressing\r\nthe General Assembly in 1981 in his capacity as Foreign\r\nMinister stressed, inter alia, that:\r\n\"The prolongation of the Arab-Israeli conflict and\r\nthe failure of all unilateral attempts to resolve it\r\ndemonstrate that only dialogue among the parties,\r\nincluding the Palestine Liberation Organization, can\r\nlead to a just and lasting solution.\" (A/36/PV.16, p. 17)\r\nWe are extremely satisfied that these historic, direct talks\r\nhave paved the way to peace.\r\nIn today’s global political landscape, the international\r\ncommunity must address many challenges that are neither\r\nfamiliar nor simple. Troubling developments in areas with\r\nvarying political and economic conditions are affecting\r\nmillions of people who are caught in a circle of violence and\r\nsuffering. Millions face starvation. We must take heart,\r\nhowever, from the determination of peoples in all parts of\r\nthe world to sustain freedom and human rights, and to\r\nchoose their futures even in the face of declining output,\r\nrising unemployment and inflation. In the quest for a better\r\nworld, for a better future, man is striving to improve his\r\nsocial, economic and political institutions.\r\nThe future of mankind is inextricably linked to the way\r\nin which we have lived and acted during the twentieth\r\ncentury and, in particular, during the last four decades.\r\nDuring this period the international community had rested its\r\nhopes on the United Nations system in order to address the\r\nchallenges of modern society. Our Organization has stood\r\nthe test of time. It has offered us a valuable service in the\r\nfields of peace and security. It has also helped us, to a great\r\nextent, in our common endeavours towards eliminating\r\ninjustice, economic imbalances and social disparities, and in\r\nsafeguarding the environment.\r\nWe firmly believe that all Members of the United\r\nNations, together, have a moral obligation to act in order to\r\nensure a better future for mankind. Previous speakers have\r\nduly stressed the need to react jointly to the challenges.\r\nIn this respect, allow me to announce that the\r\nGovernment of Greece, eager to contribute towards this end,\r\nhas the honour to propose the convening in Greece, in\r\nJanuary of the year 2000, of an international United Nations\r\nsummit aimed at adopting a global agenda for the twenty-\r\nfirst century. The general topic of this summit conference\r\ncould be \"Partners for a Better World: on the Threshold of\r\nthe Twenty-first Century\". An ad hoc preparatory committee\r\nor an open-ended working group of the whole could be\r\nestablished by this body to cope with the substance and the\r\norganizational aspects of the summit. Greece expresses its\r\nwillingness and readiness to work bilaterally and collectively\r\ntowards the realization of this United Nations summit\r\nconference. I might add that, after all, Greece was the\r\ncradle of the democracy that humanity as a whole now\r\nenjoys. It is the right place to hold the summit proposed by\r\nthe Greek Government.\r\nWe are living through a period of radical changes,\r\nespecially in Europe. Former adversaries are now\r\ncooperating on the basis of common values and principles.\r\nHistorical agreements have been reached in arms control and\r\narms reduction, both regionally and globally.\r\nThese changes have also brought new risks and\r\nuncertainties: the proliferation of new States; the\r\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 17\r\nreappearance of claims of numerous national minorities\r\nsuppressed under communism, and with them the danger of\r\ndisputed borders; and, on top of these, the economic collapse\r\nand heavy transition costs in the former communist\r\ncountries, as well as the re-emergence of nationalism,\r\nnational antagonisms, religious fanaticism and populist\r\ntendencies. All of these issues have set the stage for a new\r\napproach to the question of security and stability in Europe,\r\nwhich has emerged as the major issue of political importance\r\nin the old continent. Let me also emphasize that security in\r\nEurope is linked to the economic development and maturity\r\nof the democratic process and institutions in Eastern Europe,\r\nthe Balkan peninsula and the Maghreb. Uncontrolled and\r\nunlimited migration resulting from political turmoil and\r\neconomic hardship in these countries could cause social and\r\neconomic problems affecting even the more prosperous\r\ncountries in Western Europe.\r\nThe significance of the United Nations in maintaining\r\npeace has grown dramatically. It is enough to compare the\r\n13 peace-keeping operations undertaken during the first\r\n42 years of its existence with the same number of operations\r\nestablished between 1991 and 1992. Only last week the\r\nSecurity Council decided to establish two new peace-keeping\r\noperations in Haiti and in Liberia.\r\nThe prestige, credibility and power of the United\r\nNations have been enhanced by the positive outcome of the\r\npeace-keeping operations. However, the United Nations\r\nsystem was not ready to cope with such an extended\r\nchallenge, and there seems to be a consensus that United\r\nNations methods and capabilities need to be adjusted and\r\nimproved. More effective ways to prevent and contain\r\nconflicts have been considered by the United Nations, world\r\nleaders and respected think-tanks. The Secretary-General’s\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" has stimulated the ongoing\r\ndiscussions and has already resulted in the adoption of a\r\nseries of measures.\r\nGreece strongly supports the United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations, as well as peace-building and\r\npeacemaking activities. Our presence in Somalia, Iraq,\r\nKuwait and Western Sahara indicates our increasing\r\ninvolvement in peace-keeping. In this context, I should also\r\nmention our contribution to the United Nations polling\r\nofficers unit in Cambodia and in other parts of the world.\r\nCyprus, a member of the United Nations, still remains\r\noccupied and divided. Thirty thousand Turkish troops\r\noccupy 38 per cent of the Republic. What is more,\r\nthousands of settlers from the mainland have upset the\r\ndemographic balance of the population. We note with deep\r\nconcern a complete lack of progress towards a solution of\r\nthe Cyprus problem during this year. In spite of the efforts\r\nof the Secretary-General and his representatives, talks in\r\nNew York and in Cyprus came to a standstill because of the\r\nunwillingness of the Turkish Cypriot leadership to engage in\r\nmeaningful negotiations either on the overall agreement or\r\non confidence-building measures. We join the\r\nSecretary-General’s call to Turkey to fully assume its\r\nresponsibilities and exercise its decisive influence with the\r\nTurkish-Cypriot leaders in order to achieve progress.\r\nThe recent breakthrough in the Middle East has proved\r\nthat there are no intractable problems, if there is a political\r\nwill. This genuine will is required from Ankara in order to\r\nre-establish the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of\r\nCyprus, while guaranteeing and protecting the rights of all\r\nits citizens. Here, I would remind the Assembly that the\r\nquestion of the missing persons has not been resolved.\r\nGreece will maintain its constructive attitude in the hope that\r\nit will be reciprocated. My Government this year increased\r\nits contribution to the United Nations Peace-keeping Force\r\nin Cyprus to $6.5 million, as evidence of our strong\r\ncommitment to achieving a political settlement while\r\nsafeguarding peace in Cyprus.\r\nWe follow with particular attention the tireless efforts\r\nof the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to achieve\r\ndecisive reforms to consolidate the democratic institutions\r\nand establish an open market economy. We sympathize with\r\ntheir calls for assistance. We participate in all initiatives to\r\npromote a smooth integration of the newly established States\r\ninto international institutions. The consolidation of\r\ndemocratic institutions and processes in Russia is of the\r\nutmost importance for Europe and for my country in\r\nparticular.\r\nAn eloquent example of the upheaval brought about by\r\nthe dramatic changes in Europe is the situation in the former\r\nYugoslavia. Here, and especially in Bosnia, the upheaval\r\nhas turned into a tragedy of unprecedented proportions. No\r\nmatter how much we contribute to prevent and ease the\r\nsuffering of the people, there is no remedy unless and until\r\na political solution has been agreed upon by all parties.\r\nTheir leaders should understand that continued fighting\r\nincreases hatred and decreases the chances of a compromise,\r\nand should seize any acceptable opportunity for peace for\r\nthe sake of their people. The Co-Chairmen of the\r\nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia have\r\nexercised all their ingenuity to convince those leaders of\r\nthese simple truths. They have consistently tried to guide\r\nnegotiations towards the principles of the London\r\nConference. Cyrus Vance, Thorvald Stoltenberg and\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nLord Owen deserve our gratitude for their tremendous\r\nefforts.\r\nGreece, along with its European Community partners,\r\nplays a constructive role in the search for a negotiated\r\noverall settlement. We were close to an agreement last May\r\nafter the Athens meeting, for which the Greek Government\r\nand particularly the Prime Minister, Mr. Mitsotakis, worked\r\nhard. Let us hope that the present chance will not be\r\nmissed.\r\nWhen an agreement is reached in Bosnia, we must take\r\nan active part in the huge task of the reconstruction of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. We propose to start planning for this\r\ntask right now. The main responsibility lies with the\r\nEuropean Community. Greece expresses its readiness to\r\nhost an international meeting for the rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction of the former Yugoslavia, with the\r\nparticipation of donors, as well as of neighbouring countries.\r\nSubstantial economic and financial assistance is the\r\nprerequisite for achieving social harmony and consolidating\r\ndemocracy. Let us hope that peace will be achieved sooner\r\nrather than later. Serious consideration should be given now\r\nto planning for the day after peace is achieved.\r\nMay I remind the Assembly that the agreement between\r\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians came very suddenly. Only\r\nnow is the international community thinking of ways to\r\nassist the region to recover and achieve economic\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation. Let us not be late in the\r\ncase of the former Yugoslavia. If we act right now, we act\r\non time. The day after should be taken into serious\r\nconsideration by all concerned, and especially by the\r\nEuropean Community and the neighbouring States.\r\nMy Government deeply appreciates the efforts of the\r\nCo-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International\r\nConference on the Former Yugoslavia in accordance with\r\nSecurity Council resolution 817 (1993). We thank\r\nMr. Vance for agreeing to continue these efforts in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 845 (1993).\r\nThe resolution of this problem will enhance stability in the\r\nBalkan region. Greece’s position is clear: we are striving\r\nto eradicate a potential point of friction in the Balkans,\r\nfriction which may lead to tension with unpredictable and\r\nperhaps grave consequences.\r\nOn this occasion I reiterate our earnest desire to\r\nstrengthen, as far as possible, our relations with all our\r\nneighbours. We have pursued this policy consistently. To\r\nthis purpose, we will continue our efforts to enable our\r\nnorthern neighbours to accomplish the difficult task of\r\nreconstructing their economies. The Balkan economies are\r\ninextricably interdependent; we need the cooperation of our\r\nnorthern neighbours in order to link further our economies\r\nwith those of the Central, Northern and Western European\r\nStates. So our neighbours need the cooperation of Greece in\r\norder to integrate their economies with the European\r\nCommunity as well as to have access to the trade routes of\r\nthe Mediterranean and the Middle East.\r\nGreece is fully aware of the need to assist, and has\r\nalready enormously assisted, Albania in overcoming its\r\nconsiderable economic difficulties and consolidating its\r\ndemocratic institutions. At the same time, we again urge the\r\nAlbanian Government to grant in practice the fundamental\r\nminority rights established within the process of the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,\r\nparticularly in the fields of education and religion. Religious\r\nfreedom and the right to education should not be denied to\r\nthe Greek minority nor to any minority anywhere in the\r\nglobe. Albania cannot deny to the minorities within its\r\nborders what it itself asks for its minorities abroad.\r\nThe elimination of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nincluding in particular nuclear, chemical and biological\r\nweapons, is a goal towards which, despite progress achieved,\r\nwe must persevere. The signing of the chemical-weapons\r\nConvention on 12 January 1993 was an important step. We\r\nlook forward to the Conference of 1995 for an unconditional\r\nand indefinite renewal of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We\r\nalso note with satisfaction the progress made towards the\r\nnegotiation of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, held in\r\nVienna last June, has led to the emergence of common views\r\nand strategies involving large sectors of our societies and to\r\nprospects for better cooperation between the institutions and\r\norganizations active in this area.\r\nWe hope that the vicious circle of violence in South\r\nAfrica will end soon, with the cooperation of all South\r\nAfrican leaders, and that a new political system will be born.\r\nGreece, along with its European Community partners,\r\nintends to play a constructive role in assisting that country\r\nin its transition to majority rule.\r\nIn Somalia, the United Nations embarked upon the first\r\npeace enforcement operation to secure a safe environment\r\nfor humanitarian operations, disarm militia and pursue the\r\ndifficult task of political recovery. Pacification has been\r\naccomplished to a large extent\r\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 19\r\nthough serious problems remain. As a troop contributor to\r\nthe United Nations Operation in Somalia, Greece firmly\r\nbelieves that this operation should not be allowed to fail.\r\nGreece and its European Community partners maintain\r\na fruitful dialogue in both political and economic matters\r\nwith the countries of Latin America. This dialogue will be\r\ncontinued with great interest at the San Jose and Rio\r\nministerial meetings, which will take place next year under\r\nthe Greek presidency of the European Community and in\r\nGreece.\r\nIn many of the poorest developing countries, standards\r\nof living continue to decline, while in other developing\r\ncountries the results of economic performance are, to say the\r\nleast, mixed. Thus, some economies in Asia are vibrant.\r\nLatin America, with the debt crisis behind it, has pursued\r\nsuccessful structural adjustment programmes. On the other\r\nhand, in half of the developing world the picture remains\r\nbleak. It is particularly so in Africa. The needs are\r\ncompelling.\r\nWe share the view that growth should be sustainable in\r\nthat it creates more employment, less poverty and greater\r\nequality of opportunity, and also in that it promotes human\r\nfreedom and the preservation of the environment. Successful\r\nnational policies are necessary to bring about greater\r\nparticipation by the people in economic, social and political\r\nlife.\r\nIn concluding my statement, I appeal to every Member,\r\nnot only in my capacity as Foreign Minister of Greece, but\r\nalso as a man who wants to see his grandchildren live in a\r\ndifferent, better world - a world of tolerance, peace and\r\nsolidarity. Let us join our efforts and share our experience\r\nfor a better tomorrow. Let us be tolerant of each other in\r\norder to ensure a better life for our children and for their\r\nchildren. Let us ensure that solidarity and partnership\r\nprevail over sterile antagonism, micronationalism and\r\ntotalitarian ideologies and regimes. Let us work together to\r\neliminate war, famine, genocide, \"ethnic cleansing\",\r\nholocaust, xenophobia, racism and aggression.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
