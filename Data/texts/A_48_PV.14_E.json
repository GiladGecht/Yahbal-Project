I do so on behalf of the people and\r\nthe Government of Burundi and on our own behalf. It is in\r\nrecognition of your distinguished qualities that the Assembly\r\nhas chosen you to preside over its work at this session. We\r\nare convinced that your wisdom and your political and\r\ndiplomatic experience will enable you to guide the work of\r\nthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly in a\r\nmasterly, successful way.\r\nWe also congratulate the other members of the Bureau\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nWe wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the skill\r\nand vision with which he guided the work of the Assembly\r\nat its forty-seventh session.\r\nFurther, we express our gratitude to the\r\nS e c r e t a r y - G e n e r a l , H i s E x c e l l e n c y\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the vision with which he has\r\nguided the Organization and for his tireless efforts to ensure\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe Republic of Burundi warmly welcomes the\r\ncountries that have recently joined the United Nations\r\nfamily; we welcome the representatives of the Czech\r\nRepublic, the Slovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Eritrea, the Principality of Monaco\r\nand the Principality of Andorra.\r\nThe people and the Government of Burundi join the\r\nrest of the international community in conveying sincere\r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of India on\r\nthe earthquake that has struck their country and that has\r\ncaused the death of some 20,000 people.

GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.14\r\n20 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe beginning of this century was marked by\r\ndevastating wars that led to the crystallization and\r\nbipolarization of international relations. The ensuing cold\r\nwar, with the two major ideological and military blocs in\r\nconfrontation, was reflected in many countries by the\r\nestablishment of totalitarian power. Africa, which was at the\r\nsame time emerging from the long night of colonialism,\r\nfound itself unwillingly involved in the dynamics of that\r\nrationale. Peoples who had theoretically been freed from the\r\ncolonial yoke nevertheless found themselves, to their great\r\nconsternation, confronted with authorities that had been\r\nimposed upon them or established by force, and that were\r\ndevoid of any legitimacy, just like the colonial order that had\r\ntheoretically been brought to an end.\r\nIn that context the rights and freedoms of the human\r\nperson were openly flouted. The State based on law became\r\na mirage, the right to life and the growth of the human spirit\r\na utopian ideal. In their concern to consolidate their power,\r\nwhich lacked any popular base, some leaders inflamed and\r\nexploited inherent differences based on ethnicity and\r\nregionalism, which they imbued with political significance.\r\nOur country did not escape that state of affairs. The\r\npast 30 years have been marked by ethnic upheavals that\r\nhave traumatized our people. In truth, the history of the\r\npeople of Burundi is replete with tragedies. Political forces\r\nhave exploited ethnic differences with impunity and have\r\nfought to control the State for their own interests.\r\nOutright crimes against humanity have been committed\r\nby individuals and by organized groups, some of which have\r\nenjoyed the protection and blessing of the State, which lent\r\nitself to the perpetration of such base actions. That sowed\r\nmistrust and suspicion among the ethnic groups in our\r\ncountry, thus traumatizing the people and creating unease\r\nabout the future. So violent did the tragedy become that\r\nthere were those who wondered how Burundi would ever\r\nmanage to emerge from the toils of the violence in which it\r\nhad become enmeshed.\r\nBurundi’s recent political development demonstrates its\r\npeople’s ability to shake off those toils and to rid themselves\r\nfrom their fears.\r\nThe ideology of human rights and its corollary,\r\ndemocracy in the management of public affairs, have taken\r\nthe place of violent, repressive and exclusionary measures to\r\nsuch a degree that the people of Burundi have gradually\r\ncome to realize that in order to solve their problems they\r\nmust turn to a democracy that transcends differences,\r\ndivisions and hatreds.\r\nWe made a choice. Today, we are more than ever\r\nconvinced that that choice was a good one. The people of\r\nBurundi embarked upon this process, at first hesitant but\r\nconfident, with of course the inevitable ups and downs, and\r\nthey succeeded in holding free, just and open elections.\r\nToday, the people of Burundi are proud, proud of\r\nhaving managed to overcome the many difficulties and\r\nobstacles strewn on their path towards democracy and proud\r\ntoo of being able to take full control over their history in an\r\nopen, just and equitable way.\r\nThe date of 1 June 1993 will remain a memorable one\r\nin our country’s history. On that day, for the first time in\r\nBurundi’s history, free, pluralist and open elections were\r\nheld, designed to give the country truly democratic\r\ninstitutions. The positive manner in which the various\r\nprotagonists have accepted the people’s verdict demonstrates\r\nthat the people of Burundi are henceforth convinced that the\r\npath of democracy - and especially in its electoral aspect, in\r\nwhich the people’s will is expressed and legitimacy\r\nconferred - is the only proper way to resolve the problems\r\nentailed in the access to and exercise of power.\r\nFurther, the legislative elections of 29 June 1993 were\r\nto confirm the will of a people desirous of living henceforth\r\nin peace.\r\nWe should like to take this opportunity to extend\r\nheartfelt thanks to all who, from near or far, supported our\r\ncountry in its march towards democracy. We have greatly\r\nappreciated the material, technological and financial support\r\nprovided by friendly countries and international and\r\nintergovernmental organizations that have enabled us to\r\norganize in a suitable manner Burundi’s first free, pluralist\r\nelections.\r\nThe democratic administration of a society we are now\r\nin the process of undertaking cannot be viewed as an end in\r\nitself. Rather, it is a means to consolidate peace, to\r\nstrengthen confidence among the various components of our\r\nnation and to accelerate the economic, social and cultural\r\ndevelopment to which all men aspire.\r\nToday, therefore, the Government of Burundi is\r\nbending every effort to achieve the gradual elimination of all\r\nthe obstacles that have paralysed or retarded the Burundi\r\npeople’s drive towards growth and overall development. We\r\nare working towards this end, and we are convinced that\r\nwith the support of the international community we can meet\r\nthe challenge.\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 3\r\nIt is at present our most heartfelt hope that the people\r\nof Burundi will henceforth be safe from ethnic\r\nconfrontations. We want no more blood shed in ethnic\r\nconfrontations anywhere in the land, in the homes, in the\r\nhills, in towns and provinces, in schools and barracks.\r\nNever again! That is the watchword of the whole of the\r\npeople of Burundi.\r\nWe also want the people of Burundi to accept their\r\nhistory as it is. Mistakes have naturally been made, and\r\nthere are other serious problems that continue to weigh on\r\nour democratic process. Nevertheless, they must not\r\nobstruct or paralyse us. Setbacks and problems exist to be\r\novercome. Mistakes must be recognized as such and\r\ncorrected. That is one of the basic tenets for a new Burundi.\r\nYes, we must accept our history the better to face the\r\nfuture. We want that future to be a safer and securer one\r\nfor all. Thus, the Government we formed following the\r\nelections last June is an open Government. In it, we have\r\nbrought together people from every ethnic group, from every\r\nregion of the country and of different political persuasions.\r\nAll those people from every social background and\r\ndiffering political persuasions are working together with\r\nmight and main to ensure that the process of democratization\r\nin Burundi will be irreversible. We consider that to be the\r\nbest way to reach our goal, namely, to reconcile the people\r\nof Burundi with themselves and with their State the better to\r\ncommit themselves to the battle for their economic, social\r\nand cultural development.\r\nGuided by that will, the Government has just proposed,\r\nand the National Assembly has ratified, an amnesty law\r\nunder which more than 5,000 of our compatriots - 70 per\r\ncent of our country’s prison population - are to regain their\r\nfreedom and thereby take part in building a democratic\r\nBurundi, confident and more integral.\r\nWe wish to tell the world that through that amnesty law\r\nthe people of Burundi mean to make a new start towards a\r\nbetter development of their destiny and the installation of\r\npeace in the subregion.\r\nWhile granting amnesty to those who, at home or\r\nabroad, have derogated from the fundamental rights of the\r\npeople of Burundi as a whole and of individual members of\r\nthat people in particular, we want to accept our history\r\nwithout thereby becoming its prisoners. Through a national\r\npardon, we want to establish a context of security for all\r\nthose in Burundi who, in their hearts or in the eyes of the\r\nnation, are responsible for acts committed in the course of\r\npast tragedies. Indeed, given the tragic acts our people have\r\nknown, sometimes the result of shared responsibilities but\r\noften arising out of imprecise causes, we must wipe the slate\r\nclean. We must view the future with greater clarity,\r\nconfidence and serenity. That is a solid basis for domestic\r\npeace, but it can also contribute to the restoration and\r\noptimum consolidation of security and peace in our\r\nsubregion.\r\nThe happy outcome of democracy in our country has\r\nthus become an unprecedentedly powerful catalyst in the\r\nsettlement of another thorny problem affecting our\r\nsubregion. I refer to the question of refugees, of whom\r\nthere are some 200,000. These compatriots who are victims\r\nof tragedies of the past three decades and who have been\r\nforced to stay in exile, seeking refuge in neighbouring\r\ncountries here and there throughout the world, have had their\r\nhopes rekindled. For them - and they are perfectly right -\r\nthe triumph of democracy has removed the essential reason\r\nfor their leaving their country. Today they have chosen to\r\nreturn to their homeland, which welcomes them with open\r\narms.\r\nBefore talking about the conditions that will have to be\r\nmet before these compatriots can be assured of a safe return,\r\nI should like first to discharge the duty of thanking all\r\ncountries, particularly our neighbours Tanzania, Rwanda\r\nand Zaire, and all the international organizations, especially\r\nthose in the United Nations system, and in particular the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),\r\nthat for some 20 years have enabled them to continue to feel\r\nlike human beings.\r\nThe Government of Burundi must now continue this\r\nprocess by ensuring the happy return and the effective and\r\ndignified reintegration of these citizens into the country’s\r\neconomic, social and cultural life. To succeed, we shall\r\nhave to mobilize many material and financial resources to\r\nmeet emergency needs and satisfy long-term requirements.\r\nWe make an earnest appeal to the international community\r\nto provide such support as we engage in this highly\r\nhumanitarian process.\r\nWe are faced with a massive and spontaneous return of\r\nBurundi refugees from neighbouring and distant countries.\r\nWe are honoured and filled with joy at the confidence and\r\nspontaneity of our compatriots. At the same time, lack of\r\nthe means and the infrastructure that we need to cater for\r\nthem causes us deep concern. We are now identifying in\r\ndetail all the steps that will have to be taken if we are to\r\norganize, before next December, a conference to inform\r\nsponsors to help finance this large-scale operation.\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn the meantime, we are using the modest means at our\r\ndisposal, while relying on national solidarity and, especially,\r\non the laudable intervention of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, to whom we again express our\r\ndeep gratitude. Pending the establishment, in the receiving\r\nareas, of a medium-term plan for the gradual repatriation and\r\nreabsorption of these returnees into a global, integrated\r\ndevelopment programme, we have just published an\r\nemergency plan to deal with the arrival of 50,000 people\r\nbetween now and February 1994. The latter, because of the\r\nprecariousness of their conditions, are returning right away.\r\nThis will enable us, having secured the necessary means, to\r\nalleviate their suffering and to accord them the dignity to\r\nwhich they are entitled.\r\nIn the economic field, our major concern is to ensure\r\na just and appropriate link between human, natural and\r\nfinancial resources so that we may provide the goods and\r\nservices to satisfy the constantly increasing needs of our\r\npopulation. Development of the rural sector will require\r\nspecial attention from the public authorities, given the fact\r\nthat more than 90 per cent of our population live in the\r\ncountryside. We want to modernize the rural economy, and\r\nthe spirit of enterprise, self-improvement, research and\r\ncreativity will play a very important part in the economic\r\napproach of the new era.\r\nA conference of donors to help finance Burundi’s sixth\r\nfive-year economic and social development plan will be\r\norganized in the near future. We believe that the\r\ninternational community will give us its usual support and\r\nthat the resources necessary for implementation of the plan\r\nwill be forthcoming.\r\nMoreover, the Government of Burundi will pursue the\r\nstructural adjustment programme, with the support of the\r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\r\nDevelopment of the private sector will be encouraged, and\r\nnon-strategic public enterprises will be progressively\r\nprivatized, either in terms of property or in terms of\r\nmanagement.\r\nWithin the framework of liberalization of the Burundi\r\neconomy, the Government will reinforce the free-trade zone\r\nfor the purpose of diversifying exports. We invite investors\r\nwho are so inclined to come and operate in Burundi, where\r\nthe current political and social environment, the free-trade\r\nzone and the investment code are very favourable to\r\nbusiness.\r\nIn the social and cultural field, we shall promote the\r\nwork ethic and ingenuity and, thereby, commit ourselves to\r\npositive values, in keeping with our traditions and culture.\r\nAs we have already pointed out, democracy in Burundi\r\nis a living reality that has to be consolidated. This new\r\npolitical situation will change relations between Burundi and\r\nits foreign partners. That is why, henceforth, my country’s\r\nforeign policy will be based on the following guiding\r\nprinciples: good-neighbourliness and effective cooperation;\r\nnon-interference in the affairs of other States; the\r\nconsolidation of peace through respect for and the promotion\r\nof the rights and freedoms of the human person; mutually\r\nadvantageous international cooperation based on\r\ninterdependence and solidarity between peoples and nations;\r\nregional integration against the background of the emergence\r\nof free-trade zones in which there is no place for selfish\r\nnational purposes; and, finally, integration of the Burundi\r\neconomy into the world economy.\r\nWe believe that respect for these principles will not\r\nonly strengthen the determination of the Government of our\r\ncountry to implement a foreign policy in keeping with the\r\ndemands of its domestic policy but also foster harmonious\r\nrelations with our foreign partners.\r\nWe realize that, without development, there can be no\r\nhealthy democracy. Democratization is therefore a\r\ncontinuing process, a process that never ends - to the extent\r\nthat it is not enough to create or reform political institutions;\r\nthat it is especially necessary to resolve substantial problems,\r\nparticularly those related to health, nutrition, education,\r\nhousing and people’s general well-being.\r\nSolutions must be found for these problems, but at the\r\nsame time we must confront challenges linked to them - for\r\nexample, population growth, the steady drop in the prices of\r\nraw materials, the poor performance of our economies, the\r\nweight of external debt, natural disasters and endemic\r\ndisease, especially malaria and AIDS, which have become a\r\nreal scourge, principally in Africa.\r\nThe survival of democracy on our continent will depend\r\non our achieving a just balance in international economic\r\nrelations. The security and stability that are indispensable if\r\nsound democracy is to be guaranteed will remain under\r\nthreat so long as the problems of debt and hunger - in a\r\nword: development - are not attacked head on.\r\nThe international community would therefore be failing\r\nin its duty were it to permit the gap between the prosperous\r\ncountries of the North and the poor countries of the South to\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 5\r\nremain indefinitely. Thus, we appreciate the various\r\ninitiatives to reduce the burden of foreign debt on the\r\ndeveloping countries. We believe that economic recovery in\r\nAfrica will be achieved, in particular, when external debt is\r\nsubstantially cancelled and additional financial resources\r\nprovided. Is it right that financial flows from the South to\r\nthe North should be greater than those from the North to the\r\nSouth, as is the case today? This is a bitter reality, which\r\nrequires of us profound changes. Thus, the United Nations\r\nmust do all in its power to rethink cooperation machinery,\r\nwith a view to coming up with a solution that will reverse\r\nthe tendency towards the impoverishment of Africa in\r\nparticular.\r\nDespite the problems we have just mentioned, we must\r\nnot allow ourselves to be discouraged. Our efforts at\r\ndemocracy and development go hand in hand with a sincere\r\nsearch for regional solidarity, in the first place, and then for\r\ninternational solidarity. We know full well that, while\r\nimposed choices are intolerable, it would be an aberration if\r\nwe were to fail to act together. It is by combining and\r\nharmonizing their forces that States can make the best of\r\ntheir advantages. Burundi must not stand aside from this\r\nmovement towards solidarity. In our subregion, Burundi\r\nwill commit itself to the promotion of various types of\r\ncooperation with its neighbours.\r\nWe intend to strengthen existing instruments in the\r\ncontext of that cooperation, such as the Economic\r\nCommunity of the Great Lakes Countries, the Kagera River\r\nBasin Organization and the Preferential Trade Area, with a\r\nview to the gradual establishment of a free-trade zone. The\r\nGovernment of Burundi will spare no effort to spark\r\nsubregional cooperation aimed at increased well-being for\r\nour peoples.\r\nIt is high time that we in the third world engaged in\r\nsome self-examination. It is high time that we grew out of\r\nlooking only outwards. We must explore our own capacity\r\nfor self-development: development directed at ourselves and\r\nmaintained by ourselves. We must learn to plan and manage\r\nbetter. Above all, we must learn to work better, to work\r\nprofitably: all of us, from the humblest peasant to the\r\nloftiest dignitary. Africa is overflowing with wasted or\r\nunexploited potential. We must contemplate a development\r\nfor ourselves, a development adapted to our needs and\r\nmaking use of our assets. International solidarity can be\r\neffective only in the radically new context where we take\r\nresponsibility for ourselves and where exchanges are\r\nmutually advantageous.\r\nThe world is radically changing. Peoples aspire to\r\ngreater freedom and dignity. Mankind needs to make\r\nenormous efforts to overcome the obstacles on its path:\r\npoverty, war, famine, sickness, the destruction of the\r\nenvironment, overpopulation. These are all challenges\r\nfacing our planet.\r\nThe detente and the will for peace that characterize\r\nrelations between the major Powers following the cold war\r\ncan make it possible to achieve global security,\r\nunderstanding and cooperation; they affect the need for\r\npolitical settlements of the conflicts that have broken out in\r\nmany parts of the world. Burundi advocates dialogue and\r\njoint efforts to end disputes, and we can only welcome these\r\npositive developments in international relations.\r\nBut internationally speaking we are at the turning point\r\nbetween two eras. The era of the cold war and a bipolar\r\nworld has ended. But today the world is newly assailed, and\r\nthe inevitable seismic shock waves are shaking the global\r\nvillage. Peoples and nations everywhere are seeking new\r\nguidelines for building the new world order that has been so\r\nlate in coming.\r\nAncient rivalries we thought had been overcome are\r\nagain rising to the surface and are disturbing balances\r\nachieved at great cost. On the threshold of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, Europe has been jolted by separatist nationalism.\r\nThe plan to build a communal supranational political entity\r\nis not exempt from the harsh test posed by the eruptions\r\ntaking place in the multinational States of the long-standing\r\ndemocracies. The situation in the former Yugoslavia speaks\r\nunfortunate volumes in this regard.\r\nAfrica is being undermined by areas of disturbing\r\ndestruction. It has been all the more marginalized since the\r\nend of the division of the world into two blocs because it is\r\nno longer a bargaining chip. Where else in the world are\r\nthere so many countries without State authority, without\r\nsocial organization? Where else are there so many\r\nfratricidal wars with no solution in view? Somalia, Liberia,\r\nAngola, Mozambique and Rwanda are all loci of tension\r\nwhere instability threatens Africa as a whole, as well as\r\nworld peace.\r\nBurundi firmly supports the resolution of conflicts in\r\nthe framework of regional and subregional organizations.\r\nHence, we praise the efforts of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and subregional organizations in Africa to\r\narbitrate conflicts and help the parties to find negotiated\r\nsolutions to their disputes.\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn connection with the prevention of conflicts and with\r\nconfidence- and security-building among the States of our\r\nsubregion, we have established a permanent consultative\r\ncommittee on security questions in Central Africa, with the\r\ncooperation of the United Nations. In the committee\r\nmeetings already held, a common determination has emerged\r\nto establish a confidence-building machinery, and to limit\r\nweapons in order to benefit the development and well-being\r\nof the peoples of the subregion.\r\nMoreover, Burundi welcomes United Nations action,\r\nwhich despite many difficulties continues to play a role and\r\nto achieve success. A recent example is that of Cambodia,\r\nwhere a Government of National Unity has just been formed\r\nafter a long process carried out under United Nations\r\nsupervision. The United Nations is doing all it can to\r\nrestore order in Angola, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.\r\nWe urge the United Nations to proceed on this path.\r\nWe hail the historic agreement recently signed at\r\nWashington between the State of Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization. This development is an important\r\nmilestone in the settlement of the Palestinian problem.\r\nBurundi attaches great significance to this event, which\r\nwithout question will set its stamp on the end of the century.\r\nCloser to home, in Rwanda, Burundi hails and supports\r\naction taken by the United Nations in cooperation with the\r\nOrganization of African Unity to guarantee our Rwandese\r\nbrethren a climate favouring genuine national reconciliation.\r\nThe deployment of a neutral international force, as requested\r\nby the two parties, should be arranged as quickly as\r\npossible. Such a force is among the prerequisites for the\r\nconsolidation of peace in Rwanda, and hence throughout the\r\nsubregion - especially in Burundi, where similarities in\r\nethnic, linguistic and cultural matters place us in a delicate\r\nposition with respect to the Rwandese political conflict.\r\nBurundi also welcomes the positive developments in the\r\nsituation in southern Africa. Negotiations under way among\r\nthe various political players in South Africa have already\r\nproduced encouraging results that are strengthening mutual\r\ntrust. The Government of Burundi was pleased by the\r\ndecision of the Conference for a Democratic South Africa\r\n(CODESA) recognizing that Walvis Bay and the surrounding\r\narea belong to Namibia. That decision marks the total\r\nindependence of Namibia and is in keeping with the\r\nconsolidation of peace in the region.\r\nThat is true also of the decision in South Africa to set\r\nup a Transitional Executive Council open to all political\r\ngroups; this will lead to elections next year.\r\nBurundi enthusiastically welcomes the recent events in\r\nSouth Africa that enabled the historic leader of the African\r\nNational Congress of South Africa (ANC), Mr. Nelson\r\nMandela, to call for the lifting of economic sanctions against\r\nhis country. Burundi considers that those events are the\r\nculmination of the first phase of a process that will lead to\r\nthe emergence in South Africa of a democratic regime free\r\nof racial discrimination.\r\nBurundi hopes that the Transitional Executive Council\r\nwill be able to complete negotiations on the transition to\r\ndemocracy. That would open new prospects not only for\r\nsouthern Africa but also for the entire continent, which in\r\nrecent years has followed with special attention the obstacles\r\npreventing all the daughters and sons of Africa from\r\nenjoying their national rights, thus compromising the entire\r\nnetwork of mutually advantageous relations that could be\r\ndeveloped between South Africa and the rest of the\r\ncontinent.\r\nConcerning the difficulties facing our Organization, it\r\nis an open secret that we are facing financial adjustment\r\nproblems. The number of peace-keeping operations, the\r\nfrequency of special missions, the diversity and the\r\ncomplexity of prevailing situations all call for greater\r\nresponsibility in the payment of assessments due the\r\nOrganization.\r\nBurundi also encourages the current restructuring of the\r\nUnited Nations system, which will allow it to measure up to\r\nthe numerous new tasks awaiting it and enable it to have an\r\nimage which is a true mirror of the present world.\r\nOur country praises the exceptional courage and self-\r\ndenial demonstrated by the staff of the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees. It goes without\r\nsaying that refugees and displaced persons endure the most\r\npainful sufferings because of conflicts. The United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees constantly gives them hope\r\nby providing them with the basic necessities.\r\nBurundi, as a country that has been sheltering refugees\r\nbut that also has citizens of its own living in exile, can\r\ntestify today to its convictions and achievements on the\r\nquestion of refugees. We are convinced that only the\r\nrepatriation and reinstallation of refugees and displaced\r\npersons can remedy the problem, which has become\r\nworldwide in scope and difficult to overcome.\r\nWe would be remiss not to congratulate the\r\nnon-governmental organizations of the world, which, through\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 7\r\ntheir actions, have lessened the suffering of millions of men,\r\nwomen and children in distress.\r\nIn order to be lasting and irreversible, the democratic\r\nreforms chosen by our populations must have international\r\nsupport, because, indeed, democracy against a backdrop of\r\nsocial unrest, unemployment and poverty runs the risk of\r\nbeing just a caricature.\r\nFrom this rostrum, in the same way that we called on\r\nthe international community to witness our democratic\r\ninstitutions, we would like to ask it to support our efforts\r\nthrough international cooperation based on interdependence\r\nand solidarity among peoples and nations.\r\nThe economic situation in the world today constitutes\r\nfor us a subject of deep concern. The developed countries\r\nhave been hit by a recession, and it is not easy to overcome\r\nit. After years of more or less favourable economic\r\nconditions, growth in their economies is now slowing down.\r\nShort-term projections are not very encouraging either.\r\nUnemployment has reached disturbing proportions, thereby\r\ncausing a resurgence here and there of xenophobia and\r\nmicronationalism, victims of which are for the most part\r\nforeigners who have become true scapegoats for the ills that\r\nare distressing the societies in the developed countries.\r\nThe developing world is the most severely affected in\r\nterms of the well-being of its population. While South-East\r\nAsia and Latin America have positive economic indicators,\r\nwe must note that Africa is going through a difficult period\r\nand that the stakes are high. The drop in export earnings,\r\nlinked to the undervaluing of raw materials, weighs heavily\r\nupon the external debt that today so hinders the freedom of\r\naction of most African countries. The outlook for recovery\r\nand growth in the short term will likely remain bleak for the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\nWe would like to recall, however, that there have been\r\ndelays in the implementation of the New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, adopted by the General\r\nAssembly two years ago. Similarly, progress achieved in\r\nimplementing the New Agenda for the 1990s in favour of\r\nthe least-developed countries is still not up to the\r\nexpectations of our populations.\r\nThe International Conference on African Development\r\nis currently being held in Tokyo. We sincerely thank the\r\norganizers of that meeting, especially the Government of\r\nJapan. We wish that Conference success, and we also hope\r\nthat it will lead to concrete commitments on the part of the\r\ndonors to help us recover and to develop on the basis of our\r\nown needs and priorities. Burundi is represented in Tokyo\r\nat a high level, and it will make its contribution to achieving\r\nthe goals of that Conference.\r\nObstacles to healthy international economic cooperation\r\nare still numerous and of many kinds. The external debt\r\ncrisis remains a major hindrance to the recovery of our\r\neconomies. The main creditors must make greater efforts to\r\nease the weight of this debt, the servicing of which is a\r\nheavy burden on the meagre export earnings of our\r\ndeveloping countries. At this time, we would like to express\r\nour deep gratitude to friendly countries which have already\r\nundertaken measures - or are in the process of so doing - to\r\nreduce or cancel the debt which we owe them. We ask them\r\nto take relevant measures to give a strong boost to\r\ndevelopment financing, the drying up of which concerns us.\r\nIn this regard, Burundi places great hope in traditional\r\nsources of financing, the funds for which have been\r\nincreased. But we also place great hopes in the Global\r\nEnvironment Facility. Our delegation would like from this\r\nrostrum to repeat the need for rapid conclusion to the\r\nnegotiations on the restructuring of that fund so that it may\r\nreflect its true world calling with regard to its composition\r\nand to transparent management and democratic management\r\nin its functioning. Similarly, it is also important for the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development to move from\r\nrhetoric to an operational phase.\r\nThe series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\r\n(GATT) negotiations ought to have been concluded in 1991,\r\nbut they continue to run up against a number of\r\ndisagreements which are causing major concern in the world\r\neconomy, in particular with respect to the future of the\r\nmultilateral trading system. We urgently appeal to the\r\nprincipal protagonists to show political will sufficient to\r\nbring about a favourable ending to the Uruguay Round. The\r\ninternational community would in no way benefit from a\r\ntrade war. There would be no winner and no loser in that\r\nwar.\r\nEach year the United Nations enjoys greater\r\nparticipation at the level of Heads of State and Government.\r\nThis is due to the fact that they firmly believe in the\r\nirreplaceable role of this Organization in respect of the\r\nbalance and functioning of the world. We firmly believe in\r\nthis Organization, and therefore we permit ourselves the\r\nliberty of hoping for the promotion of international\r\ncooperation which takes account of the diversity of each\r\ncountry and which is committed to complementary actions\r\nwith shared and fully assumed responsibility.\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe United Nations indeed is an Organization of\r\npowerful countries and weaker countries. Here, therefore,\r\nwe find the principles of justice, transparency and solidarity\r\nin international affairs as something which must be\r\nrespected, so that no State need feel excluded or bullied\r\nbecause of its size. Rather, each State should feel protected\r\nagainst insecurity and arbitrariness, against hunger, against\r\npoverty, against epidemics of all kinds.\r\nIt is true, and we strongly emphasize this, that the\r\nweaker countries must not always put forward their\r\nweakness as a pretext to demand or to call for protection or\r\nassistance from the international community. They too must\r\ntake charge of their own destinies. They must organize\r\nthemselves in such a way that the United Nations or other\r\norganizations would intervene only to give them support for\r\na self-centred and self-supported development programme.\r\nIt is our deepest wish that this world Organization that\r\nwe share would continue to pursue its ideals and to achieve\r\nits goals. We would wish that international solidarity might\r\nbe a genuine reality and that the relations among States\r\nmight henceforth be based on a more just and more\r\nequitable economic and political order.\r\nIt is our hope to see our Organization help the poorest\r\npopulations on our planet avoid hunger, poverty and wars.\r\nLong live the United Nations!\r\nLong live international solidarity!\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Melchior Ndadaye, President of the Republic of\r\nBurundi, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 127 (continued)\r\nS C A L E O F A S S E S S M E N T S F O R T H E\r\nAPPORTIONMENT OF THE EXPENSES OF THE\r\nUNITED NATIONS (A/48/414/Add.4)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to draw the General\r\nAssembly’s attention to document A/48/414/Add.4. In a\r\nletter contained in that document, the Secretary-General\r\ninforms me that, since the issuance of his communications\r\ndated 21, 24, 27 and 29 September 1993, the Central African\r\nRepublic has made the necessary payment to reduce its\r\narrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note\r\nof this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nPROGRAMME OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Before calling on the first speaker\r\nin the general debate this morning, I should like to draw the\r\nattention of the General Assembly to document A/INF/48/6,\r\nwhich contains a tentative programme of work and schedule\r\nof plenary meetings for the month of October. I should like\r\nto point out that this schedule was prepared with a view to\r\nensuring that the relevant documentation would be available\r\nto delegations ahead of the discussion of any given agenda\r\nitem.\r\nThe lists of speakers for all the items listed in\r\ndocument A/INF/48/6 are now open.\r\nI will in due course announce the dates of the\r\nconsideration of other agenda items as well as keep the\r\nGeneral Assembly informed of any additions or changes.\r\nI should like to remind members that, while the\r\nAssembly fixed Monday, 19 September 1994, as the date for\r\nclosure of the forty-eighth session, it also fixed Tuesday,\r\n21 December 1993, as the date on which the Assembly will\r\nrecess until next year.\r\nI hope to keep as close as possible to this schedule so\r\nthat the Assembly can discharge its responsibilities in an\r\norderly fashion. I therefore appeal to those representatives\r\nsubmitting draft resolutions to do so sufficiently in advance\r\nof the dates fixed for consideration of items in order to give\r\nmembers adequate time to examine them.\r\nI should also like to remind representatives that at its\r\n3rd plenary meeting, the General Assembly took note of the\r\nfact that, depending on the type and complexity of proposals\r\ninvolving changes in the work programme and additional\r\nexpenditures, the preparation of a statement of programme-\r\nbudget implications by the Secretary-General could take a\r\nfew days and that, in addition, the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth\r\nCommittee would need adequate time to review the\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 9\r\nprogramme-budget implications of a draft resolution before\r\nthe latter could be acted on by the Assembly.\r\nFurther, the Assembly took note of the fact that it was\r\ntherefore desirable that Member States submit proposals\r\ninvolving statements of programme-budget implications in\r\nsufficient time to avoid cancellation of meetings and\r\npostponement of the consideration of items.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. ROBAINA GONZALEZ (Cuba) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I come from a free, small and sovereign\r\nisland in Latin America. My ancestors were able to shed the\r\nyoke of a colonial empire and achieve an independence that,\r\nsince the moment of its birth, has been burdened by the\r\ninterventionist impositions of a foreign power. I belong to\r\na people that was able, for several generations, to forge an\r\nauthentic revolution, which also opened the path to hope for\r\nother peoples of the Third World.\r\nFor these reasons, and as a Caribbean people, we are\r\ndoubly proud of having you, Mr. President, presiding over\r\nthis session. Because you are a son of that South that makes\r\nus brothers, we are convinced that that world and its hopes\r\nwill not be ignored once again. In that just aspiration you\r\nwill certainly find Cuba’s support.\r\nConditions in the world have radically changed in less\r\nthan five years. Bipolar balance is being replaced by\r\nunipolar hegemony. The world is increasingly plagued by\r\nstill insuperable contradictions between words and deeds.\r\nWhile it is said that the threat of a nuclear holocaust has\r\ndisappeared, the poverty and underdevelopment that cause\r\nmisery and death are continuing. Millions of men, women\r\nand children die every day, with no possibility of being\r\nsaved. It is said that the arms race between the super-\r\nPowers has ended but, increasingly, there is a rush to\r\ndevelop new weapons systems and even to introduce them\r\nto outer space.\r\nToday, the warlords aspire to rule the skies without\r\nhaving resolved many of the problems on Earth.\r\nParadoxically, they argue that they lack the resources to do\r\nso, while the world today is becoming increasingly\r\nungovernable because of them. The total budget of the\r\nWorld Health Organization equals the expenditures caused\r\nby three hours of the arms race. How can hunger in\r\nSomalia be alleviated, for example, if for every dollar used\r\nto feed the hungry, $10 are spent on the maintenance of\r\nmilitary operations in that country?\r\nThe existence of treaties on a partial ban of nuclear\r\ntests and on a moratorium, or on the non-proliferation of\r\nsuch weapons, is not enough. A single agreement would\r\nsuffice, one providing for general and complete disarmament\r\nand for the use of the enormous resources that would thus\r\ncease to be squandered for the final resolution of our\r\nplanet’s serious problems.\r\nRegrettably, the end of the cold war has not resolved\r\nany of the fundamental problems facing humankind; instead,\r\nit has created many others. The sacred principles of\r\nindependence and national sovereignty are being shredded to\r\npieces, and are guaranteed only to a few powerful countries\r\nwhose views prevail even in this lofty Organization. The\r\nUnited Nations was created, among other objectives, for the\r\nachievement of a lasting peace, justice and equality in\r\ninternational relations. Some things have been done, but\r\nmuch remains to be done for the benefit of human beings\r\nand of peoples.\r\nWhile the longstanding problems of the Third World\r\npersist and become more acute, aggravated by stagnation in\r\ndevelopment assistance, what peace can we speak of? While\r\nunequal exchange, external debt and the transfer of resources\r\nfrom developing to developed countries - to mention but a\r\nfew examples - still persist, will there truly be peace? While\r\nprotectionist and discriminatory practices in international\r\ntrade prevail, and the terms of trade of developing countries\r\ncontinue to deteriorate, will we honestly be able to achieve\r\njustice?\r\nOnly through effective cooperation, radically\r\nrestructuring present international economic relations, would\r\npoor nations be allowed to develop and to grow. The\r\ninitiatives adopted by the Organization by consensus are\r\ncountless yet we continue to be ignored by the most\r\npowerful countries.\r\nThe new international economic order, three\r\ninternational development strategies, four United Nations\r\ndevelopment decades, at least four special sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, a number of conferences on population,\r\nenvironment, habitat, and even the Rio de Janeiro\r\nConference itself exemplify hopes placed by peoples the\r\nworld over in the United Nations, but without tangible\r\nresults. The selfishness and lack of political will faced by\r\nthe poor of this Earth, the children of colonialism, racism,\r\nplundering and foreign intervention, are truly disappointing.\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nOn the other hand, neo-liberal doctrines are now\r\nrampant in the assistance programmes of the Organization,\r\nproclaiming only the virtues of the market and of private\r\nenterprise. Defending only these options means separating\r\npopulations of developing countries from the real production\r\nof wealth. This accentuates the inequalities, attacks true\r\ndemocracy, social development and the right of human\r\nbeings to achieve a productive and dignified life.\r\nWe the countries of the South are no more than\r\nstatistics to the North. Meticulous studies are carried out to\r\ndetermine that we will be born in greater numbers, that more\r\nof us will fall to disease and that more of us will die.\r\nThe quality of life of the generations that have been\r\nborn and have died while I speak would demand that those\r\nbulky files where tragedies are noted in detail, would also\r\nhave the power to feed and heal the needy. Simply knowing\r\nthat we are dying in the countries of the South on this planet\r\nwill not prevent us from being buried.\r\nThe surviving third world has once again placed its\r\nhopes in the preparation of an agenda for development and\r\nis awaiting with interest the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nthe subject. A new frustration would be a luxury for which\r\nwe would never be forgiven by this suffering humanity.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development to be held\r\nin 1995 will also provide us with a new opportunity to place\r\nhuman beings at the centre of the United Nations efforts, and\r\nto give this subject the priority it deserves in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe world we live in is condemned to a gradual\r\ndestruction that can only be stopped by our collective\r\nwisdom. The right to life, the most basic of human rights,\r\nis constantly threatened by the progressive deterioration of\r\nthe ozone layer, by the pollution of the environment and its\r\nunderground and surface waters, by the exhaustion of arable\r\nland and by the constant increase in the legions of the\r\nundernourished and underemployed. This dehumanizing\r\ncruelty is the result of what is mistakenly called\r\ncontemporary industrial civilization. Together with these\r\nlacerating realities, humanity is facing other challenges\r\nwhich, though different, are no less complex.\r\nRecently, the World Conference on Human Rights\r\nconcluded by reaffirming the universality, interdependence\r\nand indivisibility of those rights. That Conference rightly\r\nreiterated that the issue must be dealt with in an objective,\r\nimpartial and non-selective manner.\r\nAttempts are made to say that the majority of violations\r\nof human rights originate in the impoverished countries of\r\nthe South, while an overwhelming majority of their accusers\r\ncome from the affluent countries of the North. It seems that\r\nthose who claim to be the resolute defenders of certain\r\nindividual freedoms, also include among those freedoms, and\r\nwith equal ease, the violence that increasing neo-fascist and\r\nracist currents are unleashing in their own societies.\r\nHas that North not been the source, and now more than\r\never, of discrimination against migrant workers, against the\r\nincreasingly dispossessed strata of society and against\r\nnational minorities?\r\nWho are the main beneficiaries of the trade in human\r\norgans? Where are the deviant practices of pornography and\r\nchild prostitution, of drug addiction and the sale of minors,\r\nmost common? Are these by chance the individual freedoms\r\nthey defend with such zeal? Why are they not equally\r\nintransigent in defence of the right to eat, to work, to learn,\r\nto live a healthy life, to not suffer discrimination by reason\r\nof sex or race, in other words the most basic rights of a\r\nhuman being?\r\nWe all recognize the responsibility of the United\r\nNations in the field of the promotion of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms in accordance with the United Nations\r\nCharter. There are United Nations bodies that can\r\nadequately carry out this responsibility if attempts are not\r\nmade to assign them functions with which they are\r\nincompatible, if they are allowed to work objectively and\r\nwithout political conditions, and if they are based on\r\ncooperation and not imposition. This role must not and\r\ncannot be distorted. Thus, the idea of creating a high\r\ncommissioner for human rights should be considered with all\r\nnecessary care and without undue haste, which we could in\r\nthe future regret.\r\nIn a similar context, those who reap benefits from the\r\nexisting international order are introducing into it their own\r\nideology. They are trying to impose those norms of\r\npolitical, economic and social organization most likely to\r\npreserve that order and irrationally defend their ideas\r\nregarding the links between democracy, human rights and\r\nthe market economy, a new trilogy that masks the sufferings\r\nof millions of persons.\r\nIt is necessary firmly to reject any and all attempts to\r\ndecide unilaterally on these issues of vital interest to all\r\npeoples, and avoid their becoming new sources of conflict,\r\nnew obstacles to international cooperation and the unifying\r\nrole that humanity today expects of the United Nations.\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 11\r\nIn order to fulfil the purposes enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter and to allow the Organization to contribute\r\nto ensuring peace, cooperation and development, it is urgent\r\nto democratize the United Nations.\r\nThis would facilitate the finding of solutions to the\r\nmalformations with which the United Nations was born and\r\nwith which it developed, and its transformation into an\r\nOrganization devoted to truly strengthening cooperation\r\namong peoples. It is not acceptable that at the dawn of the\r\ntwenty-first century, the United Nations continues to respond\r\nto the interests of a handful of Powers.\r\nThe United Nations has not been and is not democratic.\r\nA veto privilege linked with the might of States is\r\ninadmissible, above all if the Security Council can become\r\na docile instrument in the hands of a few Powers, a risk\r\nwhich is present now more than ever before. There is\r\nnothing more insecure in this world, and I say this in all\r\nsincerity, than the Security Council.\r\nThe full democratization of the Security Council would\r\nrequire, among other measures, that all its members be\r\nsubject to periodic democratic elections, as is now the case\r\nwith non-permanent members. It would also require the\r\nelimination of the veto privilege and the establishment of a\r\nsingle category of members, which would be consistent with\r\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of States that must\r\nbecome, once and for all, the cornerstone of the activities of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nWe are, nevertheless, conscious of the obstacles that at\r\npresent prevent us from achieving that objective, and we\r\nconsider it not only feasible, but indeed indispensable, to\r\nprogress in that direction.\r\nThe number of peoples present in this Hall has almost\r\nquadrupled since 1945. It is therefore necessary to institute\r\na new order in the United Nations.\r\nCuba favours an increase in the membership of the\r\nCouncil to reach a proportion, with respect to the total\r\nmembership of the United Nations, that is as close as\r\npossible to that existing in 1945, and favours also a tripling\r\nof the number of permanent members so that Latin America,\r\nthe Caribbean, Africa and Asia would have more than two\r\nseats in that category, as is now the case for Europe.\r\nSuffice it to say that more than 3,700 million inhabitants of\r\nthose continents, that is, two thirds of humankind, do not\r\nenjoy that privilege.\r\nIt is also essential for the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution to be ever present in the Security\r\nCouncil, and not only among the non-permanent members\r\nbut among the totality of its membership. By so doing, we\r\nwould be advancing one step farther towards democratization\r\nof the Council’s membership.\r\nIt is also indispensable to modify the operational\r\nmechanisms of the Council and eliminate the practice of\r\nso-called informal consultations, thereby increasing\r\ntransparency in the work of the Council. This is a need that\r\nthe Secretary-General recognizes in his latest report on the\r\nwork of the Organization. By the same token, it is not\r\npermissible for the Council to go beyond its mandate and\r\ninterfere in fields that are not within its purview.\r\nThe adoption of measures to ensure greater participation\r\nby the General Assembly on issues to do with the\r\nmaintenance and strengthening of international peace and\r\nsecurity, as a means for achieving the necessary balance\r\nbetween the Assembly and the Security Council, cannot be\r\npostponed. We cannot disregard the fact that, under the\r\nCharter, the General Assembly is the only truly universal\r\nbody in the United Nations and that this gives it special\r\nresponsibilities. The Security Council acts on behalf of all\r\nthe Member States represented in this Hall and is\r\naccountable to them. This accountability should therefore be\r\nimplemented through substantive and analytical reports from\r\nthe Council to the General Assembly that would allow the\r\nAssembly not only to systematically consider and assess the\r\nCouncil’s activities, but also to formulate necessary\r\nrecommendations.\r\nThere is undoubtedly a general will to revitalize the\r\nOrganization, but this objective should be achieved through\r\nthe fullest and most transparent consultations, guided, above\r\nall, by the decisions taken by Member States.\r\nCertain recent initiatives that, without any consultation\r\nor mandate whatsoever, attempt to reinvent the priorities of\r\nthis Organization are cause for concern. There are even\r\nproposals that seem to consider the United Nations as a\r\nsupranational body with a Secretariat acting as a universal\r\ngovernment, and implementing actions that not only lack an\r\nappropriate legislative basis, but also confer on it\r\nprerogatives that are far removed from its legitimate nature.\r\nWe call the Assembly’s attention to the dangers involved in\r\nthese attempts because, if their acceptance is forced through,\r\nthey would cause serious conflict that could endanger the\r\nvery integrity of the Organization.\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nAttention should also be called to the\r\nimplementation of certain new ideas and mechanisms in the\r\nUnited Nations. Even if the resolutions regarding the report\r\nentitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" were adopted unanimously\r\nin this Hall, their implementation is not free of dangers that\r\ncould jeopardize the most sacred principles of the United\r\nNations. Nothing in those texts can justify violations of the\r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States\r\nor interference in their internal affairs.\r\nThe excessive multiplication in the number of\r\npeace-keeping operations and related procedures is also\r\ncause for increasing concern. The proliferation in this type\r\nof operation is no indication that the United Nations is\r\nfunctioning better today than in the past; quite the contrary.\r\nIn any case, it is a symptom of the grave dangers that\r\nthreaten world peace and stability.\r\nThe resulting financial burden that is falling on the\r\nshoulders of Member States is reaching unsustainable\r\nproportions. Hence, we must prevent this increase from\r\nbecoming even more onerous for Member States, and in\r\nparticular for those of the third world.\r\nIn the last decade of the millennium, our world\r\nnevertheless does show some rays of light. One of these is\r\nthat shed by the Ibero-American Summits, the most recent\r\nof which was recently held in the Brazilian city of\r\nSalvador da Bahia. I mention this as a valid example of\r\nfraternal discussion, in which, without anything being\r\nimposed by any party, issues of common interest were\r\ndefined and coordinated.\r\nRecently also, the world learned of the signing of the\r\nDeclaration that, as a preliminary measure, recognizes\r\nPalestinian autonomy over part of the occupied territories.\r\nWe hope that this development constitutes an effective step\r\ntowards the restoration of the legitimate right of the\r\nPalestinian people to have their own State, in their own\r\nnational territory, and towards the definitive withdrawal by\r\nIsrael from the other occupied Arab territories, including\r\nJerusalem. This would be an important contribution to a\r\ndefinitive solution to the Middle East conflict and to the\r\nestablishment of a just and lasting peace in that troubled\r\nregion.\r\nOnly a few days ago, in the Special Committee against\r\nApartheid, my delegation had the honour of hearing\r\nNelson Mandela. We are encouraged by his confidence in\r\nthe future, and we hope that the process of dialogue now\r\nunder way will be conducive to the establishment of a\r\nunited, democratic and non-racial South Africa. We are\r\nready to contribute, with our modest efforts, towards that\r\nend.\r\nIn my country, a genuine revolution succeeded. Since\r\nthe outset, it has faced hostility from its neighbour but,\r\nagainst all odds, it has been able to carry out, in solidarity,\r\nits humane task. We have continued our endeavour even\r\nnow that international circumstances have radically changed.\r\nCuba is inserting itself into the world economy and is\r\nopening up to foreign investment, but without the loss of any\r\nof its principles. In order to continue to safeguard the\r\ndevelopment of our people, we are also making profound\r\nchanges based on the concept of preserving our\r\nindependence and the gains we have already achieved. We\r\nare indeed facing serious problems as a result of an inhuman\r\nblockade, but we nevertheless continue to hold a prominent\r\nplace in the fields of health, education and social security,\r\nwhich are guaranteed for all even in the midst of all our\r\ndifficulties. The results of these efforts have been\r\nrecognized this year by the United Nations and by the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund.\r\nAttempts are being made to crush this dream. The\r\nGeneral Assembly, at its last session, adopted resolution\r\n47/19, regarding the necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the United\r\nStates of America against Cuba. The resolution was\r\nwelcomed by international public opinion. Since then, there\r\nhas been an impressive rise in world-wide solidarity towards\r\nour country, from every part of the world, from the most\r\ndiverse sectors and creeds, even in those wide swaths of the\r\npopulation of the aggressor country that reject the measures\r\ntaken by their own Government. Sympathy has increased\r\nfor a people that for more than three decades has managed\r\nto resist a ferocious siege by a huge, neighbouring Power,\r\nwith admirable gallantry in the midst of unimaginable\r\ndeprivation. Nevertheless, in open defiance of the decision\r\ntaken by the General Assembly and in defiance of world\r\nopinion, the blockade has been reinforced during the last few\r\nmonths by means of regulations cruelly implementing to the\r\nutmost the same laws rejected by this forum less than a year\r\nago.\r\nThe extra-territorial nature of the blockade has\r\nincreased, and the pressures are on the rise. Actions have\r\nmultiplied to impede or affect the links with Cuba of private\r\nand public economic entities in third countries. They aspire\r\nto defeat by hunger and disease the exemplary nation which\r\nthey have not been able to vanquish by force or by siren\r\nsongs.\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 13\r\nIt must be difficult for the illustrious representatives of\r\nthat great northern nation still to sustain today the thesis that\r\ntheir actions constitute a bilateral embargo, in the face of the\r\nirrefutable evidence that in fact those actions constitute a\r\nblockade.\r\nWe have provided the Assembly with irrefutable\r\nevidence of their ambition not only to maintain but also to\r\nstrengthen the blockade, to economically strangle my\r\nhomeland, to undermine the sovereignty of third States and\r\nto violate the freedom of trade and navigation, to the\r\ndetriment of the most fundamental principles of international\r\nlaw.\r\nBut there is more: if this is a case of bilateral relations,\r\nthen there are two blockaded peoples, that of Cuba and that\r\nof the United States. North Americans are denied an\r\neconomic opportunity that would benefit them; they are\r\ndenied access to the scientific advances that already\r\nguarantee the prevention and cure of diseases such as\r\nmeningitis, retinitis pigmentosa, hepatitis B and vitiligo,\r\namong other achievements of our science. The right to\r\ntravel freely to any place, which their Constitution confers\r\non all citizens, is also infringed upon.\r\nThe blockade’s effect on my people is even more\r\ninhuman. We are prevented from purchasing drugs essential\r\nfor health; our ability to acquire resources to meet the needs\r\nfor our material and social well-being is curtailed; our peace\r\nand daily life is threatened. The generation to which I\r\nbelong was born and grew up under the blockade’s siege.\r\nTo live in a sovereign and steadfast country is a crime for\r\nwhich two million children may have to pay with their lives.\r\nWe affirm before the peoples of the world that there\r\nwill be no possible absolution for those who commit or\r\nsupport this genocide, because \"to condone a crime is\r\ntantamount to committing it\". If against all logic our right\r\nwere to be denied, if aggressive forces were to prevail over\r\nreason, Cubans will nevertheless always maintain their\r\nunshakeable faith in victory. We love life, and life is\r\nfreedom, independence, sovereignty. We demand that the\r\npath we have chosen be respected. It is not our desire to be\r\na model for anyone, but we will never accept either\r\nimposition or force.\r\nI know that my words will be understood in different\r\nways, but I have said what our conscience as free human\r\nbeings dictates. My words may be applauded as a matter of\r\nsolidarity, courtesy or obligation, but I know that there are\r\nmany who wish us to be successful, for that is what they\r\nhope for themselves.\r\nTo you, Mr. President, I am thankful for having\r\nallowed me to express the feelings of a worthy people.\r\nMr. AL-NUAIMI (United Arab Emirates)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): On behalf of the delegation of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates, it gives me great pleasure to\r\nextend to you our sincere congratulations on your election as\r\nPresident of the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are fully confident that your vast experience\r\nin the area of international relations will enhance the\r\nOrganization’s role and promote its goals.\r\nI also wish to express our appreciation of the tireless\r\nefforts undertaken by your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev,\r\nin his judicious and capable management of the previous\r\nsession.\r\nIt also gives me great pleasure to extend our sincere\r\nthanks to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations, for his dedication to the important\r\nresponsibilities with which he has been entrusted and to\r\ncommend his efforts aimed at enhancing the Organization’s\r\nrole in addressing the issues that concern the international\r\ncommunity and in devising peaceful and just solutions to the\r\nproblems of development and peace as well as the issues\r\ninvolved in maintaining regional and international security.\r\nI should like also to welcome the countries that have\r\nacceded recently to the membership of the Organization and\r\nto wish them success and prosperity. There is no doubt that\r\ntheir presence among us accentuates further the universality\r\nof the United Nations and will contribute positively to the\r\nrealization of our common goals and interests in consonance\r\nwith the Charter.\r\nOn this occasion, I should like, on behalf of the people\r\nand Government of the United Arab Emirates, to extend our\r\nsincere condolences and profound sympathy to the people\r\nand Government of friendly India over the tragic loss of\r\nthousands of lives as a result of the recent earthquake.\r\nThis forty-eighth session of the General Assembly is\r\nconvened against the backdrop of new political realities that\r\nhave wrought dramatic changes in both regional and\r\ninternational relations. The most notable changes have been\r\nthe diminished threat of nuclear war and an end to the\r\nproblems that had plagued the international community since\r\nthe creation of the United Nations as a result of the era of\r\nbipolarity and competition over spheres of influence.\r\nAlthough these changes have had a positive effect, the\r\ninternational arena has witnessed several new regional\r\nconflicts that have been generated by ethnic bigotry,\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nreligious fanaticism, expansionist tendencies and the spread\r\nof the phenomenon of terrorism, which is still sweeping over\r\nsome parts of the world and which continues to pose a threat\r\nto peace and security at the regional and international levels.\r\nGiven the existence of such a situation, it is incumbent on\r\nthe international community as a whole to address these\r\nproblems and to find effective solutions thereto in the\r\ninterests of stability, development and abiding peace and in\r\norder to lay the foundations of the new world order to which\r\nall the countries of the world aspire so that they may be able\r\nto face up to the many major challenges that have come to\r\nconfront humanity as a whole.\r\nThe role and responsibilities of the United Nations and\r\nespecially those of the Security Council have expanded,\r\nsince the end of the cold war, particularly in the areas of\r\ndevelopment and the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. There is no doubt that the adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of the \"Agenda for Peace\" and other measures\r\naimed at restructuring and revitalizing the Organization in\r\nthe areas of economic and social development constitute a\r\nconstructive, positive step towards the shouldering by the\r\ninternational community of its immense responsibilities in\r\nthis regard. This will enhance the credibility of the United\r\nNations and increase its ability to become a truly effective\r\nmulti-purpose instrument in dealing with existing\r\ninternational issues.\r\nWe believe that within the new context of international\r\nrelations, the restructuring and reform of the United Nations\r\nshould embrace the Security Council as the organ\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. In restructuring the Council, the principle of\r\nequitable geographical representation of all regional groups\r\nshould be taken into consideration so that it may reflect the\r\nchanges and transformations that have taken place in the\r\ninternational political arena. Those changes and\r\ntransformations call for a new approach in addressing the\r\nissues of peace, security and development at the international\r\nlevel. Such an approach should stem from a sound\r\nunderstanding of the realities of an interdependent world so\r\nthat it may enable the international community to find\r\nsolutions that would go to the roots of old and new problems\r\nalike.\r\nIn this regard, we wish to stress that the issues of\r\npeacemaking and peace-keeping at both the regional and\r\ninternational levels in the context of preventive diplomacy\r\nshould be addressed in a manner that takes into\r\nconsideration the historical, geographical, political, social\r\nand cultural characteristics of each and every State. In so\r\ndoing, the international community should keep in view the\r\nimportance of coordination and cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, in the search for\r\npeaceful and commonly agreed solutions for existing\r\nconflicts and disputes, on the basis of international legality\r\nand the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe recent events in the Gulf in the wake of the\r\nliberation of the sister State of Kuwait have produced a new\r\npolitical reality which reinforced the belief in the importance\r\nof settling disputes by negotiation and other peaceful means\r\nas prescribed by the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nprinciples of international law, in the interests of building\r\nmutual trust and consolidating peace and security, as well as\r\npromoting stability, coexistence and good-neighbourliness\r\nbetween the States of the region.\r\nGiven our adherence to these principles in our relations\r\nwith other States both regionally and internationally, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates has declared its readiness and sincere\r\ndesire to conduct a direct dialogue with the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran with regard to Iran’s occupation in 1971 of the three\r\nislands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which\r\nbelong to the United Arab Emirates. From this rostrum,\r\nwhere many peace calls have been made, we appeal once\r\nagain to the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond positively\r\nto our call for dialogue and to start negotiating an end to this\r\noccupation and to return the three islands to the sovereignty\r\nof the United Arab Emirates.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates works jointly with other\r\nStates members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, within a\r\nframework of cooperation and solidarity in defining its\r\npolicies and its regional and international relations on the\r\nbasis of existing geographic, political and economic realities,\r\nand in a manner that is consistent with its national interests\r\nand its Arab and Muslim identity. In their recent Summit\r\nmeeting held in Abu Dhabi in December 1992, the leaders\r\nof the Gulf Cooperation Council affirmed the importance of\r\nresorting to dialogue and negotiation as a principal\r\ninstrumentality for settling disputes between States by\r\npeaceful means, in consonance with the tenets of Islamic\r\nSharia as well as the commitment of the Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil to the Charter of the United Nations and to the\r\nnorms and principles of international law.\r\nMrs. Osode (Liberia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council also affirms the\r\nimportance of respecting the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of States, and non-interference in their internal\r\naffairs. We believe that every State is entitled to choose its\r\nown political system and to exercise sovereignty over its\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 15\r\nnatural resources in line with its development objectives and\r\nenvironmental policies. We reject the use of force, or the\r\nthreat of the use of force as a means of settling disputes.\r\nWe hold that resorting to peaceful means in the settlement\r\nof disputes would enable the States involved to harness their\r\nresources in the interests of social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Iraqi regime still pursues a policy of\r\nprocrastination with regard to the implementation of all\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. In view of this, the\r\ninternational community must oblige that regime to\r\nimplement those resolutions to respect the political system,\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Kuwait\r\nand to refrain from reiterating its expansionist aims.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 833 (1993) relating to the\r\ndemarcation of boundaries between Kuwait and Iraq,\r\nguarantees the inviolability of the international boundaries\r\nseparating the two countries in accordance with Chapter VII\r\nof the Charter. The resolution is a positive step and a\r\nfundamental international contribution towards achieving\r\nregional and international peace and stability.\r\nWe also urge the international community to pressure\r\nthe Iraqi regime to abide by international humanitarian law\r\nand release immediately all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti\r\nprisoners of war and detainees. An end should be put to this\r\nhuman tragedy which violates the basic norms of\r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nAt the same time, we should like to emphasize that it\r\nis imperative to maintain the unity and territorial integrity of\r\nIraq and declare that the suffering and hardships endured by\r\nthe Iraqi people are the responsibility of the Iraqi regime\r\nbecause of its refusal to implement fully all relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nThe positive international developments resulting from\r\nthe end of bipolarity and the collapse of military alliances\r\nwere bound to produce their effects in our Arab region.\r\nToday, dialogue and cooperation between the big Powers,\r\nand the peaceful settlement of regional disputes, have\r\nreplaced the confrontations of bipolarity.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomed the convening of\r\nthe Madrid Peace Conference and the holding of bilateral\r\nnegotiations. It also welcomed the multilateral negotiations\r\nin which it participated. Likewise, it welcomed the\r\ndeclaration of principles concluded between the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel as a positive\r\nbeginning and a first step towards a just, comprehensive and\r\ndurable settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the\r\nQuestion of Palestine, on the basis of international legality\r\nas reflected in the relevant United Nations resolutions, most\r\nnotably Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\r\n338 (1973), as well as the \"land for peace\" principle. Such\r\na settlement should enable the Palestinian people to exercise\r\ntheir national inalienable rights, including the right of\r\nself-determination, and bring about a total Israeli withdrawal\r\nfrom the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City\r\nof Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan.\r\nWe support the sustained efforts undertaken by the\r\nLebanese Government to extend its national sovereignty over\r\nall the Lebanese national soil. In this regard, we call for the\r\nfull implementation of Security Council resolution 425\r\n(1978). This will contribute to the consolidation of peace\r\nand stability and to the creation of the conditions necessary\r\nfor the social and economic development of the States and\r\npeoples of the region.\r\nMy country is extremely concerned over the\r\ndeterioration of the security situation in the sister State of\r\nSomalia, which has resulted in many injuries and fatalities.\r\nWe support the efforts undertaken by the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations aimed at alleviating the suffering of\r\nthe people of Somalia and creating a secure environment\r\nconducive to the continuation of aid and humanitarian relief\r\nprogrammes and the rebuilding of national infrastructures,\r\nparticularly those relating to social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn view of the strong historical ties between our people\r\nand the people of Somalia, the United Arab Emirates has\r\nextended humanitarian and financial assistance to that\r\ncountry, in addition to its participation in United Nations\r\npeace-keeping forces. We sincerely hope that all Somali\r\nfactions, taking into account the interests of the people of\r\nSomalia, will cooperate, unite and reconcile in order to\r\nfacilitate the United Nations mission in Somalia and resume\r\nnegotiations and dialogue for the sake of achieving stability,\r\npeace and security in that country.\r\nThe people and Government of the United Arab\r\nEmirates have followed with deep sorrow the tragedy that\r\nhas beset the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina for well\r\nover 18 months. My country has also condemned the acts\r\nof killing, displacement, ethnic cleansing, genocide and rape\r\nperpetrated by Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats who are\r\nsupported by the regular army of Serbia and Montenegro.\r\nThe victims of such atrocities have been largely the Bosnian\r\nMuslims. My country supports the Security Council and\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions relating to the trial and\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\npunishment of the perpetrators of war crimes in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. The implementation of these resolutions will\r\ngo a long way towards demonstrating that the international\r\ncommunity honours its obligations and that the United\r\nNations lives up to the Charter and principles of international\r\nlaw.\r\nThe partition plan recently proposed in the Geneva talks\r\nfor the settlement of the dispute in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nlacks fairness and justice because it legitimizes aggression\r\nand \"ethnic cleansing\" and rewards the aggressors by\r\nallowing them to annex the territories they have conquered\r\nby force. In the face of this tragic situation, the international\r\ncommunity bears the historical and moral responsibility of\r\ndefending a State Member of the United Nations and\r\npreserving its independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity\r\nand enabling it to exercise its legitimate right of\r\nself-defence.\r\nThe progress recently achieved in the recent\r\nnegotiations between the political parties of South Africa,\r\nwhich culminated in a decision to form the Transitional\r\nExecutive Council, represents a positive step towards\r\nestablishing an interim Government and finalizing the\r\narrangements for the elections to be held early next year.\r\nThis progress may also be a significant step towards the\r\nformulation of a permanent constitution, which would lead\r\nto the establishment of a democratic and a united State free\r\nof racial discrimination.\r\nOne of the great challenges that still face the\r\ninternational community is the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. This poses\r\na grave threat to international peace and security; hence, it\r\nis the responsibility of the international community to\r\nencourage the adoption of confidence-building measures on\r\nthe regional and international levels to create a secure\r\ninternational environment. We believe that the nuclear\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty is the key to strengthening all\r\ninternational efforts and regional initiatives aimed at\r\npreventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nremoving the dangers that continue to threaten both regional\r\nand international peace and security.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the positive steps recently\r\ntaken in the field of disarmament, including the Convention\r\non the Prohibition of the Development, Production,\r\nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their\r\nDestruction, which was signed by the United Arab Emirates,\r\nas well as by a majority of the States of the world. We\r\nshould also like to reaffirm the importance of establishing\r\nzones free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, including the Middle East.\r\nDespite the progress achieved in the case of certain\r\ninternational political and social problems, we are yet to\r\nwitness any noticeable improvement in the international\r\neconomic environment. The gap between North and South\r\nis getting increasingly wider, and living conditions in many\r\ndeveloping countries are constantly deteriorating under the\r\nheavy burden of foreign debt, the continuing decline in the\r\nprice of commodities, and the terms of trade as well as the\r\nnegative impact of protectionist policies on those countries’\r\nbalances of payments. Given this situation, it has become\r\nthe collective responsibility of the international community\r\nto restructure the existing international economic relations in\r\na manner that would ensure effective cooperation in\r\npromoting economic development in many countries,\r\nespecially in the developing world, and thereby to improve\r\ntheir living conditions.\r\nEconomic cooperation has expanded to new horizons,\r\nespecially in the areas of development and environment.\r\nThat was underscored by the forty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly through the creation of the high-level\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development. This indicated\r\nthat the international community is well aware of the nature\r\nof existing international problems and the importance of\r\nregional and international cooperation in achieving the goals\r\nof peace and development.\r\nThe member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council\r\n(GCC) have played an active role in the field of regional and\r\ninternational economic cooperation through the constructive\r\nand practical positions they have adopted and through their\r\ncontributions and assistance to the developmental efforts of\r\nmany third world countries. This stance stems from the\r\nGulf Cooperation Council countries’ belief in the principles\r\nof economic cooperation between States, and especially with\r\nthe sisterly Arab and Islamic States. When measured against\r\nthe gross national product, the percentage of aid extended by\r\nthe GCC countries to developing countries is greater than\r\nthat provided by the developed countries, even though the\r\neconomies of the GCC countries are based primarily on oil,\r\na depletable resource. These contributions have been made\r\ndespite the need of all our countries to devote all their\r\nenergies to the process of rebuilding and maintaining their\r\nsocial and economic infrastructures that have been adversely\r\naffected by the wars and disputes of the last two decades.\r\nThe spirit of tolerance and commitment to human\r\nvalues and to the principles and purposes of the United\r\nNations Charter should guide us on the road to the better\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 17\r\nfuture that we all aspire after - a future that looks more\r\nattainable than ever before, in view of the regional and\r\ninternational changes that have taken place over the past few\r\nyears. All States, big and small, developed and developing,\r\nmust seize this historic opportunity to build on the\r\nmomentum of change in order that peaceful dialogue may\r\nprevail, consolidating the foundations of regional and\r\ninternational peace and security and peaceful coexistence.\r\nMr. AL-SHARA (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): It gives me great pleasure on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Syrian Arab Republic to congratulate\r\nAmbassador Insanally on his election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. I take this\r\nopportunity also to commend the role of his friendly country\r\nin the Non-Aligned Movement and the positive contribution\r\nto the United Nations made by the friendly countries of\r\nLatin America.\r\nI should also like on this occasion to voice our esteem\r\nto the President of the Assembly at its forty-seventh session,\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, for the success he achieved during that\r\nsession. We extend to him and to the friendly country of\r\nBulgaria all best wishes for progress and prosperity.\r\nI wish also to welcome the new Member States that\r\nhave joined our international Organization. It is our hope\r\nthat they will make a contribution to the work of the United\r\nNations with their active input.\r\nThe end of the cold war has faced the international\r\ncommunity with immense challenges and substantive\r\nquestions most of which have remained without satisfactory\r\nanswers while others have been left to the judgement of\r\nhistory and to the vagaries of time. It has become clear to\r\nmany people in various parts of the world that facing up to\r\nthese new challenges has not been an easy task for any\r\nindividual country, regardless of its power or wisdom.\r\nThe international climate has been rendered yet more\r\ncomplex and difficult by the reactions of those who have\r\nconsidered themselves to be the victors of the cold war.\r\nTheir reactions have reflected their narrow short-term\r\ninterests rather than the elements of the new reality which\r\nwould have served better both their long-term interests and\r\nthose of other countries - or which, in the very least, would\r\nnot have done harm to those interests.\r\nThis is one of the basic reasons which, to date, have\r\nprevented the emergence of a new world order. It was not\r\nreasonable to expect the countries and peoples of the world\r\nto support a system in which they have no say and from\r\nwhich they have no tangible expectations. This might\r\nexplain why from one day to the next and year after year\r\nthere has been less talk and lower expectations of the\r\nemergence of a new world order on the ruins of the old\r\norder.\r\nOn today’s international scene we see little construction\r\nand few new breakthroughs; we see many ruins, much chaos\r\nand numerous unanswered questions. Has the world of\r\ntoday become more secure and stable? Have the causes of\r\nsocial tension and the many forms of regional conflict\r\nreceded? Has the number of refugees and displaced persons\r\ndecreased? And has the life of ordinary people in the South,\r\nand even in the North, grown more prosperous or\r\ncomfortable?\r\nThese are legitimate questions, but detailing the answers\r\nbefore this Assembly will not be a source of joy or comfort\r\nto many of us, especially in view of conflagrations in\r\nvarious parts of the world which warn of increased human\r\nsuffering, ranging from killing and deportation to \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\", and real hunger. Of such things, world public\r\nopinion knows but very little. Suffice it to say that the\r\nnumber of conflicts which figure on the agenda of the\r\nUnited Nations is far smaller than those which are queuing\r\nup in the wings.\r\nWhen we say this, however, we do not wish to give the\r\nimpression, by such a graphic objective description of the\r\nnew international situation, that the past was better than the\r\npresent. Far from it. For such is not the logic of my\r\ncountry, Syria. Nor is it the logic of life, itself which, we\r\nbelieve, tends to move towards the better, inevitably and as\r\na matter of necessity, even if it sometimes stumbles here and\r\nthere or appears to be static at certain times.\r\nOur real aim in describing the post-cold-war\r\ninternational situation is to attempt a serious assessment that,\r\nwe truly believe, we share with many other countries which\r\naspire to correct the course of international relations in both\r\nthe political and the economic spheres, in order to make\r\nthem more democratic and equitable.\r\nIn this context, we find no better framework than the\r\nUnited Nations to promote international dialogue and\r\ncooperation. In order for such dialogue to have positive and\r\nfruitful results in the interest of all concerned, it is necessary\r\nto introduce democratic reforms that would restructure the\r\ndecision-making process in the Organization so that it may\r\nreflect the views of the majority. It is not reasonable, for\r\ninstance, to allow the United Nations machinery to be\r\nmanipulated, sometimes, in order to intervene in the internal\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\naffairs of countries under one pretext or another, before the\r\nMember States themselves are given the chance to introduce\r\nthe necessary reforms that would restructure the United\r\nNations in such a way as to guarantee equitable\r\nrepresentation in its main organs and prevent the use of\r\nselectivity and double standards in addressing the issues that\r\nare of vital importance to Member States.\r\nBut how can the majority of Member States expect that\r\nsuch needed reforms of the structure of the United Nations\r\nwould be introduced at a time when some countries that\r\npride in ending the cold war resort to launching covert and\r\novert cold wars against countries which would preserve their\r\nindependence and stand up for their national sovereignty?\r\nWe feel it is our duty to draw attention to the fact that\r\nfailure to introduce the required reforms will render the\r\nUnited Nations incapable of addressing the regional conflicts\r\nthat multiply daily. It is to be feared is that the important\r\nrole of this international Organization might change in the\r\ncourse of time to one of dealing with the problems of tens\r\nof thousands of United Nations soldiers entrusted with the\r\nmission of preserving a lost peace. This would drain the\r\nOrganization’s resources and distract it from the many tasks\r\nwith which it is entrusted.\r\nThe multifarious feelings of concern prevailing among\r\nmost peoples in the world, particularly in developing\r\ncountries, are deeper than might at first be apparent. We, as\r\nArabs and Muslims, might well have become more sensitive\r\nthan others recently regarding what seems to be designed to\r\nundermine our interests and distort our history, which,\r\nduring its most glorious phase, was never racial or\r\naggressive towards other peoples and religions. Rather, it\r\nwas humane and civilized, as all objective Western historians\r\nattest.\r\nWe have the right to wonder about the reasons behind\r\nthe ongoing unjust campaign against the Arabs and Muslims,\r\nwho are slandered merely because some individuals have\r\nallegedly committed a terrorist act against Western targets,\r\nwhile not a word is uttered against those who are truly\r\nresponsible for terroristic acts against thousands of Arab\r\nvictims both in the occupied territories and southern\r\nLebanon. The time has indeed come for an awakening of\r\nthe Western conscience and for addressing objectively the\r\nsensitive issues which affect the dignity of peoples and the\r\nsovereignty of States. The objectivity of the strong cannot\r\npossibly be interpreted or understood, by any ethical\r\nstandard, as a concession offered to the other party. Rather\r\nit often promotes the strong’s status and prestige.\r\nIt is well known to everyone in the world that the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict is one of the oldest, most complex and\r\nmost dangerous conflicts in the world. That is why the\r\nUnited Nations has been seized of it since it first started. It\r\nis also no secret to anyone who follows developments in the\r\nregion that Syria, under the leadership of President Hafez al\r\nAssad, maintained for 20 years its deeply rooted belief in the\r\nnecessity of establishing a just and comprehensive peace in\r\nthe region on the basis of United Nations resolutions and\r\ninternational legality.\r\nAlthough many peace initiatives were put forward\r\nduring the 1970s and 1980s in an attempt to address the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict, Syria objected to those initiatives only\r\nbecause the solutions they proposed lacked\r\ncomprehensiveness and because they ignored participation by\r\nthe Palestinians and lacked the guarantees that would\r\nsafeguard their national rights. Once it received American\r\nguarantees for the participation of the Palestinians and a\r\ncomprehensive solution on all fronts in accordance with\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\r\n(1978) and the land-for-peace formula, Syria has played a\r\npositive and fundamental role in the long and arduous\r\nnegotiations with the United States over the convening of a\r\npeace Conference in Madrid.\r\nBy responding positively to the American initiative,\r\nSyria, as the whole world has acknowledged, made the\r\nconvening of a peace Conference possible. In so doing,\r\nSyria acted on the basic of its deep conviction that, or order\r\nfor peace to be acceptable to our peoples, it has to be a just,\r\ncomprehensive peace that would result in returning return all\r\nthe Arab occupied territories and ensuring stability and\r\nsecurity for the whole region. Without such elements, peace\r\ncan neither survive nor become a true and stable peace in\r\nwhich and with which the people of the region can coexist.\r\nFor any peace to receive broad and continued popular\r\nsupport, it must be honourable for us as well as for the\r\nothers. The sons and mothers of our martyrs must feel that\r\ntheir dear ones who fell in the battlefields also contributed\r\nto establishing this peace on the basis of right and justice,\r\nand that with their sacrifices and blood they saved the nation\r\nfrom being forced to capitulate.\r\nSyria, which consistently believed in a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace and demonstrated its earnestness and\r\ndetermination to reach such peace through the Washington\r\ntalks and the constant coordination with the Arab parties and\r\nco-sponsors, is, in fact, more serious and keen in its efforts\r\nto achieve peace than those who deviated from the path of\r\nArab coordination and through their unilateral signing\r\nopened the doors of the region to all kinds of options.\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 19\r\nUnless serious and urgent efforts are made to achieve\r\nsubstantive and tangible progress on the Syrian and\r\nLebanese tracks, peace might be the weakest of those\r\noptions.\r\nWe in Syria do not exaggerate the value of this\r\nPalestinian-Israeli agreement because each and every one of\r\nits provisions needs new negotiations. At the same time, we\r\ndo not underestimate its probable repercussions, especially\r\non the Palestinian arena, where it has created sharp\r\ndivisions. Regardless of all this, however, we think that the\r\nmost serious threat the peace process faces lies in Israel’s\r\nattempts to give the impression that the signing of this\r\nagreement has achieved peace in the region, and that the\r\ninternational community, and particularly Arab countries,\r\nmust behave accordingly.\r\nThe judgement of history on the Palestinian-Israeli\r\nagreement since the secret Oslo talks has become the\r\nresponsibility of the Palestinian people and their institutions.\r\nNo one should think that Syria is going to obstruct this\r\nagreement, nor does Syria need to do so. But at the same\r\ntime, no one should expect that Syria is going to prevent the\r\nPalestinians from criticizing the agreement, while the Israeli\r\nPrime Minister has not been able to prevent Israeli\r\nopposition from doing so despite his repeated assurances that\r\nhe has made no concession to the Palestinians.\r\nYet in spite of all this, Israel still claims that it needs\r\nenough time to digest the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in a\r\nblatant attempt to evade the serious follow-up of the peace\r\nprocess launched in Madrid two years ago. In the meantime,\r\nthe international community, the United States at the fore,\r\nhas seen the necessity of capitalizing on the momentum\r\ngenerated by this agreement to continue the peace process on\r\nother tracks, particularly on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.\r\nThe Arab States have also stressed, in the communiqué\r\nissued at the meeting of their Foreign Ministers in Cairo on\r\n20 September 1993, that this first step:\r\n\"must be completed by urgent steps on all tracks and\r\nmust guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from all the\r\noccupied Syrian Golan and from the Lebanese lands ...\r\nfor the Arab League Council believes that, for peace in\r\nthe Middle East to be lasting, it has to be just and\r\ncomprehensive and must be based on Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and\r\non international legality.\"\r\nPeace cannot be built on lands under occupation, nor\r\ncan it be achieved through the usurpation of the rights of\r\nothers. Those who are trying to make people believe that\r\nthe Middle East has suddenly been transformed into an oasis\r\nof peace and prosperity know better than anyone that peace,\r\nstability and prosperity cannot possibly coexist with\r\noccupation, arrogance and the denial of the rights of others.\r\nIt is about time Israel stopped misleading world opinion\r\nand portraying itself as a victim. Is it reasonable that a\r\ncountry should continue to claim that it is the victim while\r\nit continues to produce and stockpile the most sophisticated\r\nof weapons, including all kinds of weapons of\r\nmass-destruction, and continues to occupy the lands of others\r\nby force, in defiance of United Nations resolutions?\r\nMy country, Syria, which declares its positions candidly\r\nand clearly to the whole world without fear of blame, will\r\nnot give up an inch of its occupied territories. It is\r\ncommitted to continuing the peace process in earnest and is\r\nalso committed to doing all that is required of it in\r\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions 242 (167) and\r\n338 (1973), as well as the \"land for peace\" formula. Syria\r\nwill also continue to work with the co-sponsors of the peace\r\nprocess with a view to achieving a genuine, just and\r\ncomprehensive peace so that the Middle East may indeed\r\nbecome an oasis of peace, stability and prosperity.\r\nMr. VELAYATI (Islamic Republic of Iran) (spoke in\r\nPersian; English text furnished by the delegation): I should\r\nlike, before making my statement, to express the deepest\r\ncondolences of the people and the Government of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran to the people and the Government\r\nof India on the catastrophic earthquake that has caused\r\nuntold human suffering.\r\nAllow me, at the outset, to express sincere\r\ncongratulations to Ambassador Insanally of Guyana on his\r\nwell-deserved election as President of the General Assembly\r\nat its forty-eighth session. His personal qualifications and\r\ndiplomatic experience are valuable assets, which must be\r\nutilized fully and seriously to further the purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations. I wish to assure the President of my\r\ndelegation’s unreserved cooperation in this common\r\nendeavour.\r\nI should like also to welcome the new Members of the\r\nOrganization and to express the hope that their participation\r\nin this body will enhance its universality and strengthen the\r\nspirit of universality and international cooperation. As\r\ninternational relations are currently undergoing tumultuous\r\nand decisive change, the presence here of representatives of\r\nthe overwhelming majority of nation States provides the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session with a unique opportunity\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nto shape a better future and an international environment\r\nmore in keeping with the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nOf course, such a rare opportunity is accompanied by\r\na grave and historic responsibility for every one of us. We\r\nmust acquire a full understanding of the transitional nature\r\nof international relations in the world of today, and, relying\r\non our vast collective resources and potential, we must\r\nprevent the resurgence and prevalence of the crises, wars,\r\ninjustices and human misery that have marred the first\r\n50 years of the United Nations.\r\nIf, on the eve of its fiftieth anniversary, we are to\r\nensure a more dynamic and successful future for the\r\nOrganization, we must undertake a sober reassessment of our\r\nrecord and identify our achievements as well as our\r\nshortcomings and obstacles. Regrettably, five years after the\r\nend of the cold war, some of that era’s most negative\r\ncharacteristics are still evident in international relations.\r\nExpansionism and the urge to dominate, disregard for\r\nthe material, cultural and moral values of nations, the\r\nsuppression of democracy and of democratic institutions, and\r\nthe triumph of the short-sighted interests of the dominant\r\nfew over the interests and aspirations of the majority and\r\nover human rights and the United Nations Charter and\r\ninternational law continue to impede international affairs\r\nand, most regrettably, international organizations. This has\r\npresented the United Nations with a historic challenge: to\r\nmaintain and enhance its perceived role and its credibility\r\nfollowing the Persian Gulf crisis. Moreover, despite the\r\ncessation of military rivalry between major Powers, many\r\ncomplex and grave threats - including those arising from\r\nethnic tensions, the lack of development, poverty, economic\r\nand social inequality and degradation of the environment -\r\nhave taken humanity to the edge of the abyss.\r\nDuring the era of the cold war, relations between East\r\nand West - and, consequently, international relations in\r\ngeneral - were founded on misconceptions, mutual mistrust\r\nand a total lack of confidence. These factors played a\r\ncentral role in the creation of an unsafe world, in which the\r\nUnited Nations was deprived of any opportunity to realize its\r\nvast potential for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nTherefore, our first and foremost obligation is to\r\nidentify and root out the causes of crisis and mistrust\r\ninherited from the cold war and to take appropriate steps to\r\ncreate the conditions necessary to the promotion of\r\nunderstanding and the fostering of mutual confidence at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nThis should begin with an all-out campaign of steps to\r\nrestore world confidence in the United Nations. A balanced,\r\nobjective and far-sighted approach to various international\r\npolitical, economic and cultural crises and challenges, based\r\non justice and on the common principles and objectives\r\nenshrined in the Charter, is the most fundamental\r\nrequirement for the restoration and enhancement of the\r\ncredibility of the Organization, and can also play a\r\nsignificant role in securing long-term stability and trust. In\r\nthis context, the identification, definition and deepening of\r\nshared values and common interests will facilitate\r\nunderstanding and ensure international cooperation.\r\nShould we fail in adopting such an approach, countries\r\nwill be forced into a security dilemma created by\r\nunacceptable survival options: namely, either to strengthen\r\ntheir military capabilities and thus precipitate an arms race\r\nor to succumb to expansionist Powers and their whims. In\r\neither case, the world will plunge into a new era of\r\ninsecurity and turbulence.\r\nThe Security Council plays a determining role in either\r\nheightening such a dilemma or reversing it. In other words,\r\nthe Council may either exacerbate tension and distrust or\r\nencourage understanding, confidence and respect for the rule\r\nof law in inter-State relations.\r\nIf the behaviour of the Security Council signifies an\r\nunequivocal commitment to uphold justice and the principles\r\nof the Charter, to combat aggression and to come to the help\r\nof the victims, and if the Council exhibits the political will\r\nto cease the application of double standards, then we can\r\nhope that potential aggressors will be deterred, international\r\ninstability and insecurity will be curtailed, and the immense\r\nhuman cost of wars and hostilities will be avoided.\r\nOn the other hand, when, owing to political\r\ncalculations, some aggressions and international crimes meet\r\nwith the indifference and acquiescence of the Security\r\nCouncil; when the criteria for resort to forcible measures\r\nenvisaged in Chapter VII of the Charter are the short-lived\r\npolitical interests of Powers; when aggressions and attempts\r\nto annihilate an entire nation do not receive a forcible,\r\nresolute response, while in other cases there is a rush to\r\nresort to force before attempting to understand and deal with\r\nthe root causes of a conflict; and, finally, when some\r\ndecisions of the Council are enforced with vigour and\r\ndetermination while others remain dead letters for years;\r\nthen no one can expect potential aggressors or possible\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 21\r\nvictims of foreign expansionism to form a reliable\r\nexpectation with regard to the reaction of the Security\r\nCouncil. Thus, having removed the credibility of the\r\ndeterrence factor, we should expect nothing but the\r\npersistence of aggression and expansionism and the\r\nexacerbation of the ensuing horrific human tragedies,\r\ninevitably leading to undesirable implications for the\r\nauthority and credibility of the United Nations.\r\nThe failure of the Security Council squarely to face the\r\nPalestinian crisis and the constant aggressions against the\r\nPalestinian people, Lebanon and Syria, not to mention its\r\nintentional failure to enforce its own resolutions, are a sad\r\nillustration of the prevailing preference of political interests\r\nover peace, security, international law and equity. Relying\r\non the support of a number of powerful States, Israel has\r\nwith impunity totally disregarded pertinent Security Council\r\nresolutions, unabatedly pursued a militaristic policy, persisted\r\nin aggression and expansionism and avoided any\r\ncommitment to international nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregimes. It is the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the\r\nregion. It has systematically and grossly violated the most\r\nelemental human rights of the Palestinian people and\r\nemployed terrorism in all its forms as an official policy.\r\nThese are facts, borne out by history and solidly based on\r\nobjective international observations and internationally\r\ndocumented evidence. Israel’s well orchestrated\r\nmisinformation campaign against others and its attempts to\r\nfan the flames of discord, distrust and division among States\r\nin the region cannot conceal these facts, nor should they\r\nlegitimize the unrealistic, short-sighted and imposed plans as\r\nsolutions or mechanisms to return peace and stability to the\r\nregion.\r\nIn our view, peace, stability and mutual confidence can\r\nreturn to the Middle East and to the Holy Land of Peace and\r\nRevelation only through a serious and even-handed treatment\r\nof these realities and the full restoration of the inalienable\r\nrights of the Palestinian people. Based on these objective\r\nhistorical realities, the recent accord, notwithstanding the\r\ninternational fanfare, does not present a realistic solution to\r\nthe root causes of the conflict, does not promise restoration\r\nof Palestinian rights, and thus cannot establish justice, which\r\nis the only foundation of a lasting peace. And no one can\r\ncede Palestine on behalf of the Palestinian people or\r\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif on behalf of the Muslims. We consider\r\nthe signing of this accord as a conspiracy against Islam and\r\nPalestine, and we disagree with it.\r\nThe unfolding human tragedy in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is yet further disturbing evidence of the\r\nconsequences of the Security Council’s acquiescence in\r\naggression, and failure resolutely to tackle the causes of the\r\nabhorrent attempt to annihilate an entire nation. In the face\r\nof aggression, genocide, rape and indiscriminate murder in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the Security Council, ignoring\r\nrepeated calls by the General Assembly, has failed to fulfil\r\nits international responsibility and has even deprived the\r\nvictims of the means to defend themselves. The Council,\r\nprevented from action by the illusions and imaginary\r\ninterests of a number of its permanent members, can\r\ncertainly not justify this approach by hiding behind the\r\nconvenient excuse of the existence of civil war. That excuse\r\nis unacceptable, at the least because of the fact that the very\r\nsame Council, in a much more complex situation of civil\r\nstrife in Somalia - where the identification of victim and\r\nculprit is far more difficult - has not only acted but has\r\npractically given total management of a United Nations\r\noperation to a single country, which, motivated by its own\r\nperceived interests, has undertaken massive operations whose\r\nmain victims are, ironically, the same innocent and deprived\r\npeople for whose help and protection the operation\r\nostensibly started.\r\nNow that, owing to the lack of serious action by the\r\ninternational community, the Bosnian Muslims have been\r\nforced into unbalanced negotiations under military and,\r\nunfortunately, diplomatic duress, it is imperative for the\r\nAssembly and the Security Council to take appropriate\r\nmeasures to guarantee the viability of the Government and\r\nMuslim people of Bosnia. The lifting of the arms embargo\r\nagainst the Bosnian Government and strengthening the\r\ndefensive capabilities of the Bosnian Muslims are, in our\r\nview, the most effective guarantees for the durability of any\r\npeaceful settlement and the prevention of future aggressions.\r\nFurthermore, reiteration of the principles which should\r\nunderlie any peaceful settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nis necessary to induce or, if necessary, to compel the\r\naggressors to participate seriously in negotiations for a\r\nlasting and acceptable solution. They include, most\r\nparticularly, the establishment of a durable cease-fire; the\r\nlifting of the siege of cities; unhindered access to\r\nhumanitarian assistance; the rejection of acquisition of\r\nterritory by force or ethnic cleansing; the necessity for the\r\nevacuation of territories thus occupied; the recognition of the\r\nright of the people and Government of Bosnia to seek and\r\nreceive compensation and reparations; the honourable and\r\nsafe repatriation of refugees; and individual responsibility for\r\nwar crimes.\r\nIn the light of these recent unfortunate experiences and\r\nin order to enhance the credibility of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly in the crucial area of peace and security, it is\r\nimperative to review and reconsider the behaviour,\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\noperational framework and rules of procedure of the Security\r\nCouncil. There should be no room for undemocratic\r\npractices, hidden agendas, a lack of transparency or\r\nindifference to the views of the international community, as\r\nreflected in the General Assembly. It should never be\r\nforgotten that it is the entire membership - represented only\r\nin the General Assembly - which, to quote Article 24 of the\r\nCharter,\r\n\"In order to ensure prompt and effective action by\r\nthe United Nations ... [has conferred] on the Security\r\nCouncil primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security\".\r\nThe Council acts, in the words of Article 24, on\r\n\"behalf\" of the membership. Its powers emanate from that\r\nrole and not from any inherent right. Therefore, it is\r\naccountable to the entire membership gathered in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. In today’s international climate, the\r\nprimacy of political interests and their tendency to\r\novershadow the interests of the public has generated grave\r\nconcerns about the Council’s ability to take \"prompt and\r\neffective action\". The General Assembly must therefore\r\nfully and deliberately exercise its prerogatives in this regard\r\nas the highest organ of the United Nations.\r\nConfidence-building measures by the United Nations\r\nshould not be limited only to the realm of international peace\r\nand security. Indeed, a multi-dimensional approach is\r\nnecessary to root out the seeds of tension and mistrust sown\r\nin the previous era. In this context, it is most important to\r\ntake positive, comprehensive and objective steps for\r\ninternational promotion and protection of human rights and\r\ndemocratic institutions, for controlling and reducing\r\narmaments, for combating the drug menace, for protecting\r\nthe environment, for eradicating poverty, for improving the\r\ndeteriorating economic plight of the South and for\r\nengendering sustainable development. Success in these areas\r\nwould not only enhance the credibility and authority of the\r\nOrganization, but would also remove the most tangible\r\ncauses of mistrust and tension in the world at large.\r\nIn spite of significant achievements in the international\r\ncampaign to promote respect for the exalted worth of the\r\nhuman person and the realization and attainment of the\r\nmoral and material rights of that masterpiece of creation,\r\nformidable challenges continue to persist in the task of\r\nensuring respect for the most basic rights of millions of\r\nhuman beings: the right to life and the right to a minimum\r\nof moral and material welfare. The World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights, recently held in Vienna, provided a valuable\r\nopportunity for the world community to take stock of its\r\nachievements and shortcomings in the quarter of a century\r\nfollowing the first such conference, held in Tehran in 1968.\r\nThe Conference addressed vital issues, such as respect for\r\nthe moral, cultural and religious values of all nations, the\r\nindivisibility of all human rights, and the rejection of\r\nselectivity, application of double-standards and the political\r\nmanipulation of human rights. While not ideal, the work of\r\nthe Conference can play a constructive role in enhancing\r\ninternational protection and promotion of human rights and\r\nthe progressive development of human-rights norms.\r\nIn the logic of the divine religions - and particularly\r\nIslam, which pioneered the campaign to respect and value\r\nthe exalted worth of the human being as God’s Vice-Regent\r\non Earth - human rights are vested in the human nature\r\nbestowed upon mankind by the Almighty Creator. Hence,\r\nnot only are they universal and independent of geographical\r\nand temporal boundaries, but they do not have their origin\r\nin conventions. Therefore, their definition, codification,\r\nimplementation and international promotion and protection\r\ncannot be considered the private domain of the few who\r\nenjoy temporary political and military superiority. That is\r\nparticularly true as those States do not have a shining record\r\nin internal or external protection of human rights and do not\r\noffer in their own social experience a suitable moral and\r\nmaterial environment for the welfare of human beings. If\r\nviolence and crime, which deprive the most vulnerable\r\nsegments of society of their right to life and dignity - I refer\r\nhere to the drug menace, prostitution, pornography, rape,\r\nviolence and other forms of abuse of women, the\r\ndisintegration of families, profanity and vulgarity as well as\r\ndebasing of social relations - are at least the byproducts of\r\nthe human-rights model advocated, or indeed imposed, by\r\nthat group, then others certainly have the right to examine\r\nthe prototype critically before importing it.\r\nThe universality of human rights is the very opposite of\r\narrogating to oneself the task of setting the standards for\r\nhuman rights and of judging their observance by others,\r\nparticularly since even these standards are not promoted\r\nuniversally and across the board, but are, rather, resorted to\r\nwhen and if the exigencies of foreign policy and economic\r\nand security interests require it.\r\nHuman rights and the inherent worth of the human\r\nperson are too important to be subjugated to short-lived\r\npolitical considerations and interests or used as a lever for\r\npolitical or cultural pressure or for maintaining the inequity\r\nbetween the South and the North. That can only erode their\r\ncredibility and universal acceptance. We hope that political\r\nwill and responsible behaviour by all countries, specifically\r\nthe countries of the North, will preclude a selective approach\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 23\r\nto the Vienna Declaration and enable the international\r\ncommunity to employ its collective potential to reach\r\ncommon understanding in this area and initiate a truly\r\nuniversal campaign for the promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nAnother vestige of the cold-war era, which constitutes\r\nan elemental cause of international mistrust and a general\r\nlack of confidence, is the arms race and the development,\r\nproduction, build-up and use of weapons, particularly\r\nweapons of mass destruction - all in the misplaced hope of\r\nenhancing national security.\r\nThe conclusion of the comprehensive Convention on\r\nchemical weapons, notwithstanding its shortcomings, was a\r\nhistoric achievement. Iran, the most recent victim of the\r\nlarge-scale use of chemical weapons, actively contributed in\r\nthe drafting process, was among the sponsors of the relevant\r\nresolution in the General Assembly, and was among the first\r\nsignatories of this important international instrument. The\r\neffectiveness and universality of the Convention will be a\r\nfunction of the way in which it is implemented and of the\r\ndegree of commitment of its signatories.\r\nNaturally, with the conclusion of this Convention, the\r\nexisting informal regimes which impose discriminatory\r\nbarriers on free trade in the chemical industry have lost their\r\nraison d’être and must be dismantled. The lingering of\r\nthese regimes not only violates the spirit of the Convention\r\nand the understandings reached during the process of its\r\nfinalization, but also nullifies the positive incentives for\r\nacceding to that instrument. The same applies to unilateral\r\nand illegal measures such as the disruption of the free\r\nnavigation of the Chinese vessel Yinhe, in the Persian Gulf,\r\non the pretext - subsequently proven false - that it was\r\ncarrying prohibited chemical substances. Such actions can\r\nonly lead to the erosion of the authority and credibility of\r\nthe Convention.\r\nInternational efforts to prevent the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons face a similar danger. Politically motivated\r\nand unfounded accusations against signatory States which are\r\ncommitted to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons simply undermine that important instrument and\r\nlead to international mistrust and the escalation of the arms\r\nrace. Before any decision on the extension of the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty in 1995, the process leading to the\r\nReview Conference should be fully utilized in order\r\nseriously to assess the Treaty’s record during the past two\r\ndecades in the light of its overall objective of totally\r\neliminating nuclear weapons. The shortcomings and\r\nobstacles hindering progress towards this goal should be\r\nidentified and dealt with during the Conference in 1995.\r\nAmong the most essential and useful strategies for\r\nattaining global disarmament and strengthening the\r\nnon-proliferation regime is the creation of zones free from\r\nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in various\r\nparts of the world. In the light of the constant support of the\r\nUnited Nations for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone\r\nin the Middle East, an idea initiated by Iran in 1974, it is\r\nnecessary to take constructive and practical measures\r\ntowards establishing such a zone. The institutionalization of\r\nregional confidence-building measures, including placement\r\nof all facilities and installations under the safeguards\r\nmechanism of the International Atomic Energy Agency and\r\naccession by all regional States to all international\r\ndisarmament instruments, particularly the Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty and the chemical weapons Convention, constitute the\r\nmost important elements for the establishment of a zone free\r\nfrom nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nFurthermore, the reckless build-up of conventional\r\nweapons has not only devoured much needed resources, but\r\nalso reinforced the atmosphere of mistrust and anxiety.\r\nDifferent areas have, as a result, become fair ground for\r\npolitical, economic and commercial exploitation by countries\r\nand companies that manufacture weapons. The decision of\r\nthe General Assembly to establish a Register of\r\nConventional Arms Transfers constitutes a positive first step\r\nwhich should be strengthened and further refined.\r\nHowever, it is evident that transparency in armaments\r\ncannot by itself control horizontal or vertical proliferation of\r\nconventional weapons in the world. Therefore, what is\r\nreally necessary, globally and particularly in the Middle\r\nEast, is serious and genuine international cooperation for the\r\ncomprehensive, non-selective, non-discriminatory, balanced\r\nand effective reduction of conventional arms. This may be\r\nrealized, inter alia, through the reduction of military budgets,\r\nof weapons procurement and of the presence of foreign\r\nforces in different regions. The Islamic Republic of Iran has\r\nbeen cited by impartial international sources as the country\r\nwith the lowest defence budget in the region and the fewest\r\nweapons purchases. As such, Iran is naturally prepared to\r\nengage constructively in any serious, practical and\r\nnon-sensational collective effort in this regard.\r\nAbove and beyond all these steps, it is most essential\r\nto generate the necessary political will to formulate and\r\ndirect national policies geared towards fostering an\r\ninternational atmosphere of mutual confidence. This can be\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nrealized only by basing national policies on a commitment\r\nto the rules and principles of international law, particularly\r\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of others;\r\nthe inviolability of internationally recognized boundaries;\r\nrejection of the threat or use of force for the settlement of\r\ndisputes; non-interference in the internal affairs of others;\r\nand refraining from advancing unfounded claims against the\r\nterritory of other States. The positive impact of such an\r\napproach on promoting good-neighbourly relations,\r\nencouraging regional cooperation and the enhancement of\r\nsecurity is self-evident.\r\nConsistent with its national and strategic interests, and\r\ncognizant of its heavy responsibility in this region, the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran has historically acted as the force\r\nfor stability in the Persian Gulf region. Domestically, the\r\ngreatest part of the national budget has been allocated to\r\neconomic, social and cultural development projects and\r\nreconstruction. The policy of converting military industries\r\nto civilian use and employing the armed forces in the\r\nreconstruction sector has been vigorously pursued. Thus,\r\ndespite serious obstacles, fundamental progress has been\r\nachieved in across-the-board development of the country and\r\nreconstruction of war-damaged property. Similarly, in order\r\nto help foster regional confidence and trust, and in spite of\r\nsensitive regional conditions and the bitter experience of a\r\nrecent foreign aggression against the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, we have allocated a mere 1.5 per cent of the national\r\nbudget for defence and have had the lowest military\r\npurchases in the entire region.\r\nExternally, Iran has formulated its policy with a view\r\nto encouraging and promoting security and stability in the\r\nregion, as well as expanding political, economic, cultural and\r\nscientific cooperation between the countries of the area. The\r\nposition of principle adopted by Iran in the course of the\r\nPersian Gulf crisis; our constant effort to prevent the spread\r\nof violence in the region; our even-handed and consistent\r\nemphasis on international understanding and compromise in\r\nAfghanistan and Tajikistan; our attempts to secure a peaceful\r\nsettlement in the Caucasus; our being host to the highest\r\nnumber of refugees in the world; and the humanitarian\r\nassistance extended by Iran to victims of crisis in the region;\r\nthese are all consistent with our policy of strengthening\r\nstability, preventing tension and mitigating the human\r\nsuffering of the crisis victims in the region. We firmly\r\nbelieve that the pursuit of these efforts, along with\r\nconsultations and cooperation between concerned States and\r\ninternational organizations, is required to contain and settle\r\nthese conflicts and alleviate their ensuing human tragedies.\r\nTo ensure peace and stability in Central Asia and the\r\nTranscaucasus, it is necessary to encourage trade with the\r\ncountries of Central Asia and the Caucasus, create the right\r\nconditions for economic development in each country,\r\nreinforce regional commonalities and complementarities, and\r\nimprove the opportunities for these countries to participate\r\nmore profitably in world trade. The efforts of the members\r\nof the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) to achieve\r\nthese goals and to overcome obstacles to regional\r\ndevelopment by consolidating mutual cooperation and\r\nfostering cooperation with other countries and international\r\norganizations will contribute positively to regional and\r\ninternational peace and security. Formal collaboration\r\nbetween ECO and the United Nations, which requires\r\napproval by the Assembly of ECO’s request for observer\r\nstatus, will also expedite the realization of these objectives.\r\nThe vital importance of the Persian Gulf for the\r\nsecurity and economic development of the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran is self-evident. Iran, with the longest coast on the\r\nPersian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, has historically equated\r\nits own national security and economic prosperity with\r\nsecurity, stability, tranquillity and the free flow of oil and\r\ninternational commerce in the Persian Gulf area. It has\r\nthereby acted as a force for stability. In this context, we\r\nhave also proposed the establishment of regional security\r\nand cooperation arrangements in the Persian Gulf, whose\r\noutline I presented to the forty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly. The experience of two devastating wars in the\r\nPersian Gulf region within one decade clearly illustrates the\r\nfact that baseless territorial claims lead to the erosion of\r\nunderstanding and confidence, only furthering the interest of\r\nforeign Powers.\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 25\r\nThe common religious, cultural, historical and\r\ncommercial heritage of the countries of this region provide\r\na good and solid foundation on which initiatives to reinforce\r\nmutual trust and develop multilateral cooperation between\r\nthese States can be founded. The Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nhas taken the initiative by manifesting its political will and\r\nadopting practical measures in order to strengthen political\r\nties and further develop and consolidate commercial,\r\neconomic and cultural cooperation with our neighbours in\r\nthe Persian Gulf. In turn, we would welcome and respond\r\naccordingly to any positive step from our neighbours.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating that recent international\r\ndevelopments and emerging challenges have placed the\r\nUnited Nations at a critical and historic crossroads. Success,\r\nin our view, will depend on a sober understanding of the\r\ncauses of tension and mistrust during the cold war, followed\r\nby resolute steps to root them out. Joint effort is also\r\nneeded to develop and put into motion multidimensional\r\nconfidence-building measures and techniques, consolidate\r\nand expand international cooperation, and bring about\r\nconditions conducive to the attainment of common\r\naspirations of humanity, particularly justice, security and\r\nbalanced development. The Islamic Republic of Iran is fully\r\nprepared to intensify its efforts in cooperation with other\r\nStates in this Assembly and in other bilateral and multilateral\r\nenvironments for the attainment of these objectives.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
