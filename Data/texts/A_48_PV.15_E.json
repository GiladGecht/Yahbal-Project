ANTONIO MASCARENHAS\r\nMONTEIRO, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF\r\nCAPE VERDE\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Cape Verde.\r\nMr. Antonio Mascarenhas Monteiro, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cape Verde, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic\r\nof Cape Verde, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Mascarenhas\r\nMonteiro, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident MONTEIRO (spoke in Portuguese; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): I should like to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Your well-known skills\r\nand your vast knowledge of the United Nations augur well\r\nfor the success of the session’s work.\r\nI should like to pay a tribute to your predecessor as\r\nPresident, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, former Foreign Minister of\r\nBulgaria, for work well done.\r\nI should also like to express my appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the dynamism he has brought to\r\nUnited Nations activities, for his constant efforts to\r\ncontribute to the betterment of the Organization and for his\r\npersonal commitment to reforming the Secretariat structures\r\nand improving the Organization’s efficiency in the discharge\r\nof its functions and duties.\r\nWe live in a time of great hopes. The political events\r\nof the recent past have greatly facilitated adherence to\r\ndemocratic values, while at the same time they have\r\ncontributed to the world movement in favour of respect for\r\nhuman rights and have promoted the world’s awareness of\r\nthe necessity for urgent measures to improve the living\r\nconditions of all peoples as well as the planet’s environment.\r\nIndeed, in a short period of time a substantial number\r\nof countries have, against all odds, attained their\r\nindependence and recovered their freedom. The ideological\r\nconfrontation of the past has been replaced by political\r\ncooperation between countries, and conflicts with a long\r\nhistory, such as the struggle against apartheid and the\r\nsituation in the Middle East, seem finally to be close to a\r\nnegotiated solution. On the other hand, democracy, as a\r\ndesirable system of government, has gained an\r\nunprecedented dimension and support, although much\r\nremains to be done to consolidate it.\r\nThese are indeed political developments of the greatest\r\nimportance that shape and at the same time are the result of\r\na world in profound transformation. That transformation\r\nbodes well for a more stable future in the relations between\r\nnations and peoples. While on the one hand these changes\r\naugur well for a better, more humane and more just and\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86734 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.15\r\n22 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nstable world, they have, on the other hand, been\r\naccompanied by the resurgence of many conflicts, most of\r\nthem of an internal nature. Indeed, in many regions of the\r\nworld, especially in Europe and in Africa, ancient ethnic\r\nrivalries or internal struggles for power have turned into\r\nopen conflicts, leaving a trail of death and destruction,\r\nspawning millions of refugees and displaced persons and\r\ngiving rise to regional instability.\r\nI have been witnessing with deep concern the\r\ndevelopment of many of these conflicts in Africa, which\r\nhave a negative impact not only on the countries involved\r\nbut on the entire region. At a time when all our efforts and\r\nresources should be put to good use to assist the\r\ndevelopment of our countries and continent and to create\r\nbetter living conditions for our peoples, we have come to\r\nrealize that the scarce resources that we still have in our\r\ncountries are wasted on the fire of armed conflicts, and the\r\nfew economic structures that were left are being sacrificed\r\nto violence.\r\nThe armed conflicts that appear to proliferate almost\r\neverywhere seem to elude the efforts of the United Nations.\r\nIn most of these conflicts, the world has been faced with\r\ntremendous difficulties in containing and managing them,\r\nnotwithstanding the constant efforts of the Security Council\r\nand the Secretary General.\r\nSuch is the case of the conflict in Angola, a sister\r\ncountry whose suffering people have for more than 30 years\r\nendured the horrors of war, the anxiety of constant instability\r\nand the uncertainty of the future. Despite the enormous\r\nefforts made, especially by the United Nations, the conflict\r\nin Angola continues to cause death and the destruction of the\r\ncountry. The international community had placed great\r\nhopes in the elections of September last year that were\r\nsupervised by this Organization. We all expected that those\r\nelections would be the last step in a peace process that\r\nwould finally put an end to decades of destruction and give\r\nbirth to a new and democratic Angola, thus creating the\r\nclimate of political and social harmony in the country so\r\nmuch needed for its development.\r\nInstead, the events that followed the elections have been\r\nregrettably translated into a violent and tragic situation\r\nknown to the whole world, a situation which is a cause of\r\ndeep concern to us all and in which many thousands of lives\r\nare being lost, while the suffering of the population that has\r\nlasted so long continues and the destruction of cities and the\r\neconomic infrastructure goes on. Unfortunately, the repeated\r\nmediation efforts of the United Nations and other forums\r\nand entities, geared towards obtaining a cease-fire and the\r\nresumption of the Bicesse process, have so far not attained\r\nthe expected results.\r\nThere should be no illusions, for, as the long history of\r\nthis conflict has abundantly demonstrated, no military victory\r\ncan guarantee lasting peace and stability and the prosperity\r\nof the country. I do not envisage any alternative to\r\nnegotiations if peace is to prevail as a goal to be achieved\r\nby all in Angola. The use of violent means following the\r\nelections cannot be justified and, indeed, shows blatant\r\ndisregard for the sovereign will of the people, which was\r\nexpressed freely and fairly, as certified by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nI sincerely hope that, worn out by a protracted and\r\ndevastating war, faced with a country whose economic\r\nstructure has been destroyed and touched by the social and\r\nhuman drama caused by the hostilities, the parties to the\r\nconflict, especially UNITA, will rise to the moment and,\r\nmoved by political realism, lend the negotiations the much-\r\nneeded political will and seriousness, thereby demonstrating\r\nthe magnanimity that the security and the well-being of the\r\nAngolan people require.\r\nThe Angolan experience is a lesson that should be taken\r\ninto consideration by the Organization in managing or\r\nassisting in the management of other conflicts. One such\r\ncase is the conflict in Mozambique, a country to which Cape\r\nVerde is linked by fraternal ties. My country, as a member\r\nof the Security Council, has been following the situation in\r\nMozambique very closely and with particular interest. After\r\nmany years of war, peace seems finally to prevail in that\r\ncountry. The General Peace Agreements concluded last year\r\ndefined the framework for the attainment of final and lasting\r\npeace. I therefore ascribe the utmost importance to the\r\nobservance and timely implementation of these Agreements\r\nby both parties. It is a moral duty to the people of\r\nMozambique, who are still going through the hardships of\r\nday-to-day life and who legitimately aspire to a future of\r\npeace, harmony and progress, that these Agreements be\r\nrespected and abided by.\r\nThe positive steps taken lately in this regard give me\r\ngrounds for hope. In this context, I consider particularly\r\nimportant the dialogue that has started between the President\r\nof the Republic of Mozambique, Mr. Joaquim Chissano and\r\nthe President of RENAMO, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama. I hope\r\nthat that dialogue will continue on a regular basis with a\r\nview to facilitating the removal of obstacles that might arise\r\nduring the implementation of the peace agreements, so as to\r\nenable the elections to take place on the scheduled date. I\r\nappeal to both parties to exert all their efforts with a view to\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 3\r\nexpediting the implementation of key aspects of the\r\nAgreements before the elections, namely, the demobilization\r\nand the cantonment of troops and the formation of the\r\nnational army of Mozambique.\r\nI should also like to refer to the conflict in Liberia,\r\nwhich has been the focus of the attention of the countries of\r\nthe West African subregion to which my own country\r\nbelongs.\r\nThe conflict in Liberia has caused much destruction and\r\nthe loss of thousands of lives, and has inflicted enormous\r\npain and suffering on the population. It has been a source\r\nof constant concern to the countries of our subregion. The\r\nCotonou Agreement, a decisive step in the quest for a lasting\r\npeaceful solution to the conflict, is the result of the\r\ninternational community’s commendable efforts to establish\r\npeace in Liberia, efforts in which the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) played a pivotal role.\r\nThe recent Security Council decision to deploy an\r\nObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) to assist, in\r\ncoordination with the forces of the ECOWAS Military\r\nObserver Group, in the implementation of the Cotonou\r\nAgreement is an appropriate and commendable one. I\r\nappeal to all the parties involved to abide by their\r\nobligations and cooperate with the United Nations and\r\nECOWAS in order to secure the timely implementation of\r\nthe peace agreement and the holding of the legislative and\r\npresidential elections on the scheduled date at the beginning\r\nof next year.\r\nThe situation in Somalia is one of the most tragic\r\nconflicts of modern times. This tragedy has resulted in the\r\nloss of hundreds of thousands of lives and in the\r\ndisintegration of the country’s civil society and\r\nadministrative structures. The Security Council’s timely\r\ndecision to involve the United Nations in the management of\r\nthe conflict and the humanitarian action of various\r\norganizations and entities have changed the situation in\r\nSomalia and created the conditions for the return of\r\nnormalcy to the country.\r\nMr. Mroziewicz (Poland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nI commend the internationalist and humanitarian role of\r\nthe United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM), whose\r\npresence there has contributed much to eliminating famine,\r\nre-establishing order and guaranteeing the security of the\r\npopulation, despite the condemnable and deliberate attacks\r\nto which the Operation has been subjected.\r\nIt is imperative that immediate efforts be made, in\r\naccordance with the last decision of the Security Council, to\r\naccelerate the process of consultations and contacts with all\r\nthe parties and forces in Somalia, with a view to creating a\r\nclimate of security there and bringing political harmony and\r\nadministrative normalcy to the country.\r\nOn a more positive note, it is encouraging to see the\r\nprogress made in the negotiations to bring the regime of\r\napartheid to an end. The announcement of the establishment\r\nof a Transitional Executive Council is a major event in the\r\nlong struggle against apartheid which will finally be\r\neliminated with the holding of democratic elections next\r\nyear.\r\nNotwithstanding the substantial progress made over the\r\nyears in the field of peaceful solution of inter-State conflicts,\r\nthe tendency still persists in some countries to solve conflicts\r\nwith other countries through the use of force. The conflict\r\nbetween Iraq and Kuwait illustrates well such a tendency,\r\nwhich led to the disastrous Gulf war. Despite the tragic\r\nlesson taught by this war and the various resolutions adopted\r\nby the Security Council, much tension still exists between\r\nthe two countries. I hold it to be of fundamental importance\r\nto peace in the region that the two sister countries live\r\ntogether as good neighbours and respect their common\r\nborders, in accordance with the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nNot long ago, we all thought that the conditions for\r\npeace and stability in the world had finally arrived, since the\r\ndanger of a super-Power military confrontation and the\r\nrivalry between the two blocs had disappeared with the end\r\nof the cold war. However, we are now, paradoxically,\r\nconfronted as never before with a series of armed conflicts.\r\nThe time has come for a deep collective reflection in order\r\nto identify ways to contain these conflicts. At the same\r\ntime, preventive measures should be adopted to eliminate or\r\ndiminish the possibility of potential conflicts degenerating\r\ninto armed confrontation. Preventing conflicts is the most\r\nsecure and least expensive way of saving lives and\r\npreserving international peace and security.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s \"Agenda for Peace\" contains\r\na series of ideas and recommends a number of measures for\r\nthe management, control and prevention of armed conflicts.\r\nI believe that most of the measures proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General, in particular those having to do with\r\npreventive diplomacy, should be put into practice as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe United Nations and the regional organizations\r\nshould be able to create effective mechanisms to control\r\npotential conflicts and to eliminate the political and social\r\nconditions which spawn them. We should bear in mind that\r\nthe majority of the armed conflicts which today affect almost\r\nall regions of the world are internal, though some have\r\ninternational implications because of their repercussions on\r\nthe peace and stability of neighbouring countries. If we\r\nwant to prevent such armed conflicts, we should be able to\r\naddress their root causes.\r\nAmongst these root causes, attention should be focused\r\non the limitations imposed by the denial of effective\r\nparticipation by all citizens in the process of the governance\r\nof their country, as well as on the violence resulting from\r\ndisrespect for the fundamental human rights of the individual\r\nor of ethnic or religious groups.\r\nI believe - and this is demonstrated by our own\r\ndemocratic experience in Cape Verde - that the internal\r\nstability of a country and the social harmony among its\r\nvarious groups have much to gain when all citizens are able\r\nto exercise freely, fairly and fully their political rights by\r\nparticipating in the definition of their country’s destiny,\r\nchoosing their system of Government and freely and\r\nperiodically selecting their Government leaders.\r\nThe changes that have taken place in the international\r\nscene have unequivocally demonstrated the importance of the\r\nprotection of human rights for all countries. Indeed, the\r\nrespect for and the promotion of these rights have gained a\r\nglobal dimension and are today one of the most visible\r\nglobal issues on the international agenda. My country has\r\na Constitution enshrining a vast list of fundamental rights,\r\nand the respect for human rights is one of the most\r\nimportant pillars of its internal and external policies. We\r\ntherefore welcome the central role that the protection of\r\nhuman rights has today on the agenda of nations. Cape\r\nVerde is deeply committed to the cause of human rights\r\npromotion. Our policies and Government actions are guided\r\nnot only by humanistic considerations but also by practical\r\nmotives, for we believe that the respect for human rights\r\nintroduces an equilibrium that creates internal conditions\r\nfavourable to economic development and social harmony.\r\nI therefore find it all the more difficult to accept the\r\nprecarious human-rights situation in which the people of\r\nEast Timor find themselves. In this regard, I encourage the\r\nSecretary-General to pursue his efforts with a view to\r\nfinding a negotiated solution to the question of East Timor.\r\nIn a world fraught with ethnic conflicts, respect for the rights\r\nof minorities should deserve the best of our attention and\r\nrequires a deeper national awareness and better international\r\nprotection as well.\r\nI commend all those countries that have actively been\r\npromoting, at the world level, the cause of human rights.\r\nHowever, I think that such promotion must not be selective.\r\nFor my country, the situation in which migrant workers find\r\nthemselves in certain receiving States is an equally important\r\nhuman-rights issue.\r\nSince Cape Verde is a country with an emigrant\r\ncommunity abroad that is larger than the island’s resident\r\npopulation, I cannot miss this opportunity to express my\r\ndeep concern about the hurdles and difficulties that migrant\r\nworkers are increasingly facing in certain receiving\r\ncountries, difficulties that, in some cases, amount to flagrant\r\nviolations of their fundamental human rights.\r\nIt is unfortunate to note that in many countries,\r\nincluding some developed countries, the rights of migrant\r\nworkers are being neglected or simply forgotten. The\r\nworsening of the economic situation in these countries has\r\nbeen accompanied by a worsening of discriminatory actions\r\nand practices against the expatriates and the implementation\r\nof policies that frustrate the enjoyment of their hard-won\r\nrights, leading to their expulsion from countries where they\r\nhave, for long, been making an honest living and to whose\r\neconomy they have been making great contributions. The\r\nfuture of humankind cannot be seriously protected in the\r\nabsence of values that are inherent to sincere and fraternal\r\nsolidarity.\r\nHuman rights cannot be adequately promoted and\r\nprotected if, in many countries, poverty persists and if their\r\npeoples continue to live on the periphery of development and\r\ntheir populations continue to endure the hardship of extreme\r\npoverty. Underdevelopment brews conditions conducive to\r\ngeneralized and persistent violations of the most fundamental\r\nrights of the human person, especially the rights of women\r\nand children. Indeed, the poverty and precarious living\r\nconditions generated by underdevelopment give rise to social\r\nand political instability, which, in the end, will have an\r\nenormous effect on international peace and security.\r\nIt therefore becomes imperative for us all to work\r\ntowards effective cooperation for development in order to\r\nguarantee a minimum standard of human dignity and living\r\nconditions, thus breaking the chain of poverty and human\r\nsuffering. I hope that the answer to some of these concerns\r\nwill be found during the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 5\r\nIn this regard, the African countries are facing a\r\nparticularly difficult economic and social situation. Affected\r\nby drought and desertification, confronted with the social\r\nand economic strangulation caused or worsened by many\r\narmed conflicts, marginalized by a system of economic and\r\nfinancial cooperation more prone to respond to the needs of\r\nother regions and countries, and torn by widespread poverty\r\nand the worsening of living conditions, the African countries\r\nare in dire need of urgent measures on the part of the\r\ninternational community to assist them in their necessary\r\ninternal development efforts.\r\nAgainst this background, I commend the timely\r\ninitiative of the Japanese Government to promote the\r\nconvening of an International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment, set to take place this month in Tokyo. It is\r\nmy sincerest hope that this Conference will produce the\r\nexpected results. In this regard, developed countries should\r\nincrease substantially the resources earmarked to support\r\nAfrican countries in their development efforts, especially at\r\na time when these countries have embarked on fundamental\r\neconomic reforms, imprinting more dynamism on the private\r\nsector, promoting the economic diversification of their\r\ncountries and introducing structural adjustments.\r\nI share the views of those who advocate the need for\r\nthe democratization of Africa. I would, however, like to\r\nemphasize that the promotion of democracy cannot be\r\nreduced simply to the setting up of formal democratic\r\nmechanisms and guarantees. Our own democratic\r\nexperience in Cape Verde has taught us that, although\r\ndemocracy is the most desirable system of government and\r\nshould, at all times, deserve our support, its consolidation\r\nand full acceptance by all the segments of the population\r\nrequire a favourable internal economic climate so as to have\r\na positive impact on the creation of better living conditions\r\nfor all.\r\nI would like to seize this opportunity to emphasize the\r\ngreat interest that my country, as an island nation, attaches\r\nto the preparatory work for the First Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, which is to take place next year. It is my most\r\nfervent hope that this Conference, the first initiative on the\r\nimplementation of the decisions and commitments\r\nundertaken in the framework of Agenda 21, will produce\r\nsatisfactorily concrete results.\r\nCape Verde equally attaches utmost importance to the\r\nongoing negotiations on the draft convention on\r\ndesertification, in the implementation of a Rio Conference\r\ndecision. Let us hope that this draft Convention will be\r\nconcluded at an early date and will substantially contribute\r\nto the creation of the international mechanisms needed to\r\ndeal effectively with the devastating effects of drought and\r\ndesertification, which have been causing immense damage to\r\nthe economy of the affected countries and to the global\r\nenvironment as well.\r\nWe are living a historic moment, a moment full of\r\npotential for a collective future of peace and development.\r\nWhile on the one hand we have lately been confronting\r\npainful realities and negative developments that have raised\r\nreal concerns for those of us interested in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, on the other hand it is\r\ncomforting and encouraging to note the profound positive\r\nchanges that have taken place not only in inter-State\r\nrelations but also, and especially, in the redefinition of our\r\nsystem of values which will, we hope, in peace and harmony\r\nguide nations in their internal as well as in their international\r\nrelations in the coming decades.\r\nWe should seize the opportunity offered by the\r\nremaining few years of this century to act with determination\r\nand commitment with a view to consolidating democracy in\r\nthe world, promoting human rights and, at the same time and\r\nwith the same commitment and determination, recognizing\r\nthat the foundation for a new world order can reside only in\r\nthe development of countries and in cooperation amongst\r\nthem in order to arrive at solutions to the global problems\r\nthat affect us all.\r\nThis is my conviction as the Head of State of a small,\r\npeace-loving country that has always advocated dialogue\r\namong peoples and countries, and also as a citizen of this\r\nworld, which I wish were more humane and more united.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nCape Verde for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Antonio Mascarenhas Monteiro, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cape Verde, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nADDRESS BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS SDECH\r\nKROM LUONG NORODOM RANARIDDH, FIRST\r\nPRIME MINISTER OF THE ROYAL GOVERNMENT\r\nOF CAMBODIA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the First Prime Minister of the Royal\r\nGovernment of Cambodia.\r\nHis Royal Highness Sdech Krom Luong Norodom\r\nRanariddh, First Prime Minister of the Royal Government\r\nof Cambodia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have pleasure in welcoming the\r\nFirst Prime Minister of the Royal Government of Cambodia,\r\nHis Royal Highness Sdech Krom Luong Norodom\r\nRanariddh, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nPrince NORODOM Ranariddh (Cambodia): First of\r\nall, may I be permitted to join previous speakers in\r\nexpressing deep sadness and sorrow at the loss of thousands\r\nof lives in Killari, India, as a result of the tragic earthquake\r\non 30 September 1993. On behalf of the Government and\r\npeople of Cambodia may I offer our profound condolences\r\nto the Government of India and to the relatives of the\r\nvictims.\r\nIt is a privilege and an honour for me to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly at their forty-eighth session as the First\r\nPrime Minister of the democratically elected Royal\r\nGovernment of Cambodia, where, in accordance with the\r\nmandate given to the Organization by the Paris Agreements\r\nof 23 October 1991, the United Nations has played a\r\nhistoric, decisive and successful role in ending 23 years of\r\nsuffering and misery for our people.\r\nMay I express a warm welcome and congratulations to\r\nMr. Samuel Insanally of the Republic of Guyana on his\r\nelection as President of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am sure that\r\nAmbassador Insanally will lead the deliberations of this body\r\nto a successful conclusion.\r\nI also wish to convey our warmest thanks and\r\nappreciation for the tireless work undertaken by his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of the Republic of Bulgaria,\r\nfor his judicious and capable management of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session.\r\nCambodia welcomes Andorra, the Czech Republic,\r\nEritrea, Monaco, the Slovak Republic and the Republic of\r\nMacedonia to this international body. Their decision to\r\nbecome Members of the United Nations will no doubt help\r\nto strengthen peace and security in the world.\r\nOn behalf of His Majesty, Norodom Sihanouk, King of\r\nCambodia, of His Excellency, Mr. Hun Sen, Second Prime\r\nMinister of the Royal Government of Cambodia, and on\r\nbehalf of our people, may I be permitted to express our\r\nprofound and everlasting gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de\r\nCuellar, former Secretary-General of the United Nations; to\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, current Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations; and to Mr. Yasushi Akashi, Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations in Cambodia, who are the artisans of the success of\r\nthe United Nations operation in Cambodia, which has\r\nbrought to our people peace, freedom, independence and the\r\nbeginning of a period in which democracy will be\r\nestablished in our motherland.\r\nAvailing myself of this solemn opportunity, I should\r\nlike to recall the important historic role played by Indonesia,\r\nFrance, Thailand, Japan and the People’s Republic of China,\r\nwhich hosted crucial meetings on Cambodia that have led to\r\nthe present positive results. I should like to express my\r\ndeepest gratitude to the following eminent personalities, their\r\nExcellencies President Suharto and President François\r\nMitterrand, Mr. Roland Dumas, Mr. Ali Alatas, Mr. Gareth\r\nEvans and Mr. Ahmed Rafeeuddin for their tireless\r\ncontributions to the success of this precious peace process.\r\nWe are most gratified by the many congratulatory\r\nmessages from Governments welcoming the promulgation of\r\nthe new Constitution of Cambodia and the reaccession to the\r\nthrone of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. Last, but\r\nnot least, the official recognition extended to the new,\r\ndemocratically elected Royal Government of Cambodia\r\nconstitutes an act of justice, which to us is of great\r\nencouragement.\r\nThe success of the United Nations operation in\r\nCambodia can be described as a combination of trust in the\r\ngood will of the international community to save Cambodia\r\nand of the will of the whole Cambodian population to save\r\nits homeland.\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 7\r\nThe Cambodian people, by their participation, in huge\r\nnumbers, in the free and fair elections held in our country\r\nlast May, played a decisive role in sowing the seeds of\r\ndemocracy in Cambodia. His Majesty King Norodom\r\nSihanouk, father of the Cambodian nation, played a crucial\r\nrole in encouraging and nurturing national reconciliation\r\namong all Khmers, and provided firm support for the United\r\nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) and\r\nfor Mr. Yasushi Akashi, the leader of UNTAC. The steps\r\ntaken by His Majesty ensured success for the last stage of\r\nthe peace plan, including the drafting of our new\r\nConstitution and the orderly transfer of power.\r\nI am indeed pleased to report that the peace process in\r\nCambodia continues in accordance with the Paris Peace\r\nAgreements. The elections, in which, happily, huge numbers\r\nof my compatriots participated, were free and fair. Despite\r\ntremendous difficulties and constraints, the outcome was\r\nmost encouraging for the future of democracy in Cambodia.\r\nCambodia’s new Constitution, which was drafted by a\r\nsovereign Constituent Assembly, established a constitutional\r\nmonarchy within the framework of a democratic and liberal\r\npolitical system, under which the people are the sole source\r\nof State power, and the judiciary is totally independent of\r\nthe legislature and the executive. The constitutional\r\nmonarchy represents the will of the people, expressed\r\nthrough their elected representatives in the constituent\r\nAssembly. Under the new Constitution, respect for human\r\nrights and individual freedoms has a key place.\r\nEven though we have the same leadership as we had\r\nduring the transitional period, when the provisional\r\nGovernment was in power, the establishment of the Royal\r\nGovernment of Cambodia will ensure the social stability and\r\npeace that are so necessary to enable us all to dedicate\r\nourselves to the reconstruction and development of our\r\nhomeland.\r\nWe still need a peaceful settlement of the Khmer Rouge\r\nproblem. This problem must be resolved by the Cambodian\r\npeople. We hope that a solution will be arrived at during\r\nthe course of the November round-table discussions, at\r\nwhich His Majesty the King will preside. In this regard, the\r\nposition of the Royal Government of Cambodia is perfectly\r\nclear: we are ready to welcome the Khmer Rouge group as\r\nadvisers to the Royal Army and the Royal Government.\r\nHowever, we demand that, in return, the Khmer Rouge\r\ngroup assume the same responsibilities as were undertaken\r\nby the other three former parties that signed the Paris\r\nAgreements: that its administration be dismantled; that its\r\narmies and its zones become part of a single national entity,\r\na unified and indivisible Cambodia whose territory and land\r\nand maritime borders are internationally recognized, as was\r\nthe case in the 1960s; and that there be a central\r\ngovernmental structure consisting of a national Assembly, a\r\nRoyal Government, Royal armed forces and a Royal\r\nAdministration.\r\nThe international community should guarantee the\r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\nCambodia. Indeed, a unique international guarantee is\r\nclearly enshrined in the text of the Agreement on a\r\nComprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia\r\nConflict of 23 October 1991, Part III, which is entitled\r\n\"Agreement concerning the sovereignty, independence,\r\nterritorial integrity and inviolability, neutrality and national\r\nunity of Cambodia\".\r\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia solemnly pledges\r\nthat it will scrupulously respect the relevant clauses of\r\narticles 1 and 3 of Part III of the Agreement. Cambodia\r\nrequests that, in return, all signatories to the Paris\r\nAgreements of 23 October 1991 respect the clauses\r\ncontained in articles 2, 4 and 5 of Part III.\r\nThe new Cambodia counts on all countries signatories\r\nto the Paris Agreements to\r\n\"solemnly undertake to recognize and respect the\r\nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and\r\ninviolability, neutrality and national unity of\r\nCambodia.\"\r\nNotably, the parties must\r\n\"refrain from interference, in any form whatsoever,\r\nwhether direct or indirect, in the internal affairs of\r\nCambodia.\"\r\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia urges that those\r\ncountries which have not yet subscribed to the Paris\r\nAgreements of 23 October 1991 do so in order to help\r\nCambodia and the Cambodian people, who have suffered so\r\nmuch, to maintain and reinforce this fragile peace. This is\r\nsomething that benefits not only Cambodia but the entire\r\nAsia-Pacific region. Maintenance of peace will be the sole\r\nguarantee of recovery and reconstruction in Cambodia.\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe are determined to conclude this process, and we\r\nshall do so by ourselves. However, after 23 years of war\r\nand suffering, Cambodia is a devastated country. Thus, the\r\nnew Cambodia needs aid and assistance from the\r\ninternational community. We pledge that we shall devote all\r\nour meagre human and financial resources and the extremely\r\ngenerous assistance of the international community to the\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of our devastated and\r\nimpoverished country.\r\nWe welcome the great success of the Tokyo Ministerial\r\nConference on the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of\r\nCambodia that took place in June 1992 and the success of\r\nthe international conference on the reconstruction of\r\nCambodia that was held in Paris last month. The success of\r\nboth these conferences is an indication of the international\r\ncommunity’s great compassion for the Cambodian people,\r\nand we shall be for ever grateful.\r\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia is determined,\r\nwith the help of the international community, to take all\r\nappropriate measures to meet this tremendous challenge. We\r\nare determined to respect and abide fully by the\r\narrangements provided for in Part IV of the Paris\r\nAgreements of 23 October 1991 on the rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction of Cambodia.\r\nIt is precisely because we are determined to achieve\r\nthese objectives that His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk,\r\nwith the agreement of the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Representative for Cambodia, asks,\r\nthrough the Secretary-General and the Security Council:\r\nFirst, a United Nations integrated office should be\r\nestablished in Cambodia.\r\nSecondly, the offices of the specialized agencies, such\r\nas the United Nations Development Programme, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund and the World Food Programme,\r\nshould be retained in Phnom Penh.\r\nThirdly, we should maintain the human rights\r\ncomponent in Phnom Penh and expand it into a permanent\r\nhuman rights centre.\r\nFourthly, we should continue the demining operations\r\nwithin the framework of the Cambodian Mine Action Center.\r\nFifthly, we should actively maintain in Phnom Penh a\r\nteam of military observers, who would help us to build\r\nconfidence among the Cambodian people and would also\r\nserve as a guarantee against external threats.\r\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia wishes to draw\r\nthe attention of the international community to the problem\r\nof the mines which have been laid throughout Cambodia.\r\nCurrent research shows that there are between 6 million and\r\n10 million mines in Cambodian soil. The Royal\r\nGovernment requests the ongoing cooperation of the\r\ninternational community in removing as many of these mines\r\nas possible. In particular, we request assistance from the\r\ncentral database of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre,\r\nwhich is one of the most crucial aspects of the whole\r\noperation. The Cambodian Mine Action Centre has so far\r\ncleared over 3,883,230 square metres of minefield. The\r\nremaining task requires special equipment and a budget\r\nspanning the next 5 to 10 years. We hope that the\r\ninternational community can help us make our country safe\r\nfor present and future generations.\r\nAlso, as a signatory to the 1970 Convention on the\r\nMeans of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import,\r\nExport and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, and\r\nas the Angkor monuments have been listed since December\r\n1992 as a world heritage site, we request the international\r\ncommunity to give unstinting assistance to the Royal\r\nGovernment of Cambodia in its struggle against the illicit\r\ntraffic of Khmer cultural patrimony, which has been subject\r\nto unprecedented looting and vandalism. In order to recover\r\nthese valuable cultural properties, we appeal to all countries\r\nwhich export such goods and through which they are\r\ntransported - whether or not they have ratified the foregoing\r\nConvention - to adopt the following steps to help us. First,\r\nthey should prevent national museums and similar\r\ninstitutions from acquiring any antiquities which are native\r\nto the Kingdom of Cambodia. Secondly, they should ban\r\nthe import of these cultural properties as soon as they are\r\nlegally listed in the inventories of Khmer national patrimony,\r\nif they are not legally licensed by the competent Cambodian\r\nauthorities for export purposes. Thirdly, they should take all\r\nnecessary steps to ensure that antique dealers and merchants\r\nof cultural resources assist the Royal Government of\r\nCambodia in recovering and repatriating those cultural\r\ntreasures illegally exported from the Kingdom of Cambodia.\r\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia wishes to express\r\nits deepest appreciation to the countries of the Association\r\nof South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for their past and\r\nongoing efforts to help Cambodia and the Cambodian people\r\nachieve peace, freedom and independence. We in Cambodia\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 9\r\nnote with sincere admiration the tremendous development\r\ntaking place in the countries of ASEAN, and we hope to\r\nlearn much from their extensive experience.\r\nCambodia very much regrets that conflict has engulfed\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, a country that always maintained\r\nclose and friendly relations with us. We sincerely hope that\r\nthe current negotiations will put an end to the suffering of\r\nthe innocent people of the various regions of that unfortunate\r\ncountry.\r\nCambodia also regrets the renewal of conflicts in\r\nSomalia, Angola and Georgia. We hope that the intervention\r\nof the international community will put a swift end to these\r\nconflicts that have caused so much bloodshed.\r\nCambodia congratulates the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization and the State of Israel for reaching initial\r\nagreement on some of the issues that have divided them for\r\nso many years and caused so much suffering to the\r\nPalestinian and Israeli peoples. We urge them to pursue\r\ntheir efforts to achieve permanent peace. My Government\r\nis thus pleased to announce that Cambodia has officially\r\nrestored diplomatic relations with the State of Israel at the\r\nambassadorial level.\r\nCambodia welcomes the progress achieved in the\r\ndiscussions between the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States of America. We support the\r\n10-point programme proposed by President Kim Il Sung for\r\nthe peaceful reunification of Korea, and we also support the\r\ntotal nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.\r\nWe have followed with satisfaction the positive\r\ndevelopments in South Africa, where apartheid is being\r\ndismantled. We are aware that many obstacles remain and\r\nwe hope that they can be removed without senseless violence\r\nand in peaceful and constructive cooperation between the\r\nblack majority and the white minority.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nBefore I conclude, may I be permitted to pay profound\r\nhomage to the courageous military and civilian personnel of\r\nthe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, who\r\nhave given their lives for the cause of peace in my country.\r\nTheir names are enshrined deep in our hearts.\r\nCambodia’s complex problems have been solved\r\npeacefully thanks to the tireless efforts of Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nThe Royal Government and people of Cambodia salute him\r\nand highly commend and praise him for his just leadership\r\nin the crucial Cambodia conflict and for bringing it to a\r\npeaceful settlement.\r\nThe message the people of Cambodia have entrusted\r\nme to convey to the General Assembly is one of gratitude,\r\nof hope and of continuous cooperation with the international\r\ncommunity with a view to strengthening peace, democracy\r\nand respect for human rights in Cambodia. We know that\r\nour task is huge, complex and by no means easy, but we\r\npledge to do our utmost to bring it to a successful\r\ncompletion.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the First Prime Minister of the\r\nRoyal Government of Cambodia for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nHis Royal Highness Sdech Krom Luong Norodom\r\nRanariddh, First Prime Minister of the Royal Government\r\nof Cambodia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nMr. MORAVCK (Slovakia): I wish to convey my\r\ncongratulations to Ambassador Insanally on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nI wish him luck and success in his high office.\r\nLet me also thank the President of the previous General\r\nAssembly session, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for his effective\r\nguidance of its deliberations.\r\nI would also like to express my profound appreciation\r\nto His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, for all his dynamic work in\r\nleading this organization.\r\nA year has passed since I last had the honour to address\r\nthe Assembly. As the last Minister of Foreign Affairs of the\r\ncommon State of Czechs and Slovaks, I asked\r\nrepresentatives at the forty-seventh session for their\r\nunderstanding and support for the process of transformation\r\ntaking place at that time in the Czech and Slovak Federal\r\nRepublic, and I reiterated the desire of the new successor\r\nStates to be admitted to the international community of\r\nsovereign States on an equal basis.\r\nIn addition to its membership in the United Nations, the\r\nSlovak Republic today is a member of 53 international\r\norganizations, including United Nations specialized agencies,\r\nthe Council of Europe and the Conference on Security and\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE). We declared our interest in\r\nthe fastest possible integration, together with other countries\r\nof the Visegrad Four, in such effective Euro-Atlantic\r\npolitical, security and economic organizations as the\r\nEuropean Community, the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) and the Western European Union.\r\nSlovakia is building its statehood on civic principles\r\nbased on respect for individual rights. The objective of the\r\nSlovak Republic as a multi-ethnic State is to create a\r\nfunctioning system of ethnic coexistence and guarantees of\r\nequal rights and opportunities for all.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe tragedies of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of\r\nGeorgia alert us to inconsiderate and irresponsible attempts\r\nto gain political capital from nationalistic sentiments. We\r\nare against steps, regardless of their motivation, that would\r\nultimately lead to the creation of ethnically pure territories\r\nand States and that would question or endanger the peaceful\r\ncoexistence of populations of different ethnic origins. We\r\napply the existing international norms regulating such\r\npeaceful coexistence and we favour their further elaboration.\r\nWe support the idea of adopting a generally binding\r\ndocument on the rights of persons belonging to national,\r\nethnic and other minorities in the United Nations, the CSCE\r\nand the Council of Europe. We are convinced that such a\r\ndocument must equally respect the territorial integrity of\r\nStates and the principle of inviolability of existing borders.\r\nOur economic policy aims to build a balanced and\r\nprosperous economy based on market principles. Thus far\r\nthe reform measures have not brought the expected\r\neconomic revival. The economic difficulties are aggravated\r\nby various internal and external factors, among others the\r\nconversion of the armaments industry. The 1990 decision on\r\na far-reaching conversion led to the reduction of Slovakia’s\r\nmilitary production to an unprecedented 9 per cent of the\r\n1989 level. This political decision to close a whole major\r\nbranch of Slovak industry without the necessary preparation\r\nfor a real conversion, though highly moral, did not take into\r\naccount its economic and social consequences.\r\nIf we are to attain the necessary economic growth, we\r\nneed access to the markets of developed nations, something\r\nwhich is increasingly complicated - all the more so because\r\nof the economic recession. We are convinced that\r\nprotectionism is not a solution. We hope that negotiations\r\non the further liberalization of world trade will be successful,\r\nin particular the negotiations of the current Uruguay Round\r\nof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\r\nWe also feel encouraged by clear expressions of a\r\npolitical will to reform and remove export controls inherited\r\nfrom the cold war period that now unfairly burden legitimate\r\ncommerce and unduly restrain growth and opportunities, as\r\nrecently stated by President Clinton before this body.\r\nIncidentally, on this very day, Slovak representatives\r\nare signing an association agreement between the Slovak\r\nRepublic and the European Community in Luxembourg.\r\nThe association agreement, which we consider the first step\r\nin our efforts to gain full membership in the Community,\r\nalso reflects the general direction of our foreign policy. It\r\nencourages further positive development in our country, and\r\nwe believe that it will help us resolve some of the\r\naforementioned economic problems.\r\nThe international community is daily confronted with\r\nsuch tragedies as that in Bosnia and Herzegovina or\r\nTajikistan, with countries at the crossroads, such as Russia\r\ntoday, but happily also with encouraging developments, such\r\nas those in the Middle East and in South Africa.\r\nIt is only natural that the United Nations adapt itself to\r\nthe increased tasks in its mission as the guardian of\r\ninternational peace and security. To manage the ever-\r\nincreasing load of responsibilities more effectively, it is\r\nnecessary to pay attention to early warning and preventive\r\naction at an early stage. Equally demanding our attention\r\ntoday is the phase of post-conflict peace-building and\r\nrestoration as a basis for preventing the renewal of conflicts.\r\nRegarding the peace-keeping operations of the United\r\nNations, common experience urges us to require\r\nimprovements in their planning and execution. Every\r\noperation should have clearly defined political objectives, an\r\nunambiguous mandate, and an understanding of its possible\r\nand feasible scope and duration and of available means and\r\nsupport. When the Security Council sets up a new\r\noperation, it should define and ensure security and safety\r\nconditions and guarantees under which the operation is to be\r\ndeployed. We support the idea of a universally binding legal\r\ninstrument on the safety of peace-keeping operations\r\npersonnel. Troop-contributing countries should also have the\r\npossibility, through some regular mechanism, of being\r\nconstantly informed and consulted prior to and during the\r\nwhole operation.\r\nAnother means of enhancing the effectiveness of\r\npeace-keeping is increased cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional arrangements, such as the Conference\r\non Security and Cooperation in Europe. In the Euro-Atlantic\r\narea, we should also seek involvement in peace-keeping of\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 11\r\nsuch organizations as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) or the Western European Union. All these\r\norganizations should be mandated in every specific case by\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nSlovakia is among the countries that have been most\r\nseverely afflicted by the sanctions against the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. We shall provide data on these\r\nlosses shortly. We believe that the effort to secure effective\r\neconomic assistance should not be limited to moral appeals\r\nto States and institutions. The economic situation of the\r\ncountries depending on the Danube as their main waterway\r\nhas been ever more aggravated by arbitrary acts of blockade\r\nand other violations of the respective United Nations\r\nresolutions and international conventions. We are convinced\r\nthat such acts require a clear and resolute response.\r\nThe decision of the Geneva Conference on\r\nDisarmament on a mandate for a comprehensive nuclear-test-\r\nban treaty is a major move in itself. It also sends a signal\r\nto the whole non-proliferation regime. We support the\r\nuniversal and indefinite extension of the non-proliferation\r\nTreaty. We also hope that the question of the nuclear\r\narsenal of the former Soviet Union will be satisfactorily and\r\nspeedily resolved in the spirit of non-proliferation.\r\nSlovakia welcomes the establishment of the United\r\nNations Register of Conventional Arms, which we consider\r\nto be a first decisive step leading to increased global\r\ntransparency and constraints in conventional weapons. We\r\nare ready to support moves towards enhanced transparency,\r\nas well as more detailed information on military holdings\r\nand procurement through national production, made under\r\nthe banner of the United Nations, the Conference on\r\nDisarmament or the Conference on Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe.\r\nWishing to ensure full continuity with the activities of\r\nCzechoslovakia - an original member of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament - and enjoying the support of the Eastern\r\nEuropean regional group, the Slovak Republic applied for\r\nmembership in the Conference on Disarmament. A window\r\nof opportunity for Slovakia to become a member was opened\r\nby the proposal to gradually enlarge the membership of the\r\nConference. Those on the proposed list of 23 new members\r\nshould in our opinion be admitted as soon as possible.\r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the\r\nuniversality of and respect for human rights and the need for\r\ntheir universal application. It also, appropriately, drew our\r\nattention to the vital interdependency of human rights and\r\nsustainable development, and their bearing on international\r\npeace and stability. We are prepared to support steps\r\ntowards implementation of its recommendations. Slovakia\r\ntherefore encourages the establishment of a post of United\r\nNations high commissioner for human rights.\r\nRecent developments in many areas of the world where\r\ncivilian populations are increasingly the targets in\r\npredominantly non-international conflicts impel us to demand\r\nthat States and parties to conflicts strictly observe and\r\nenforce the rules and principles of international humanitarian\r\nlaw. We support efforts to bring those who are alleged to\r\nhave committed war crimes to justice, inter alia through the\r\nestablishment of an international criminal court.\r\nInternational humanitarian agencies and organizations,\r\nwhose activities we highly esteem and support, can attest to\r\nanother deplorable feature of today’s world: the misuse and\r\neven the rejection of humanitarian assistance for political\r\nreasons. Those conducting humanitarian operations are\r\nworking under increasingly unsafe conditions. The\r\ninternational community should demand respect for human\r\nrights and humanitarian norms by the States and parties to\r\nconflicts. Neither should we completely ignore the fact that\r\nsanctions which are rightfully applied against those who\r\nhave breached international peace and security have a direct\r\nbearing on the fate and even the lives of innocent civilians.\r\nIn a true humanitarian spirit, we should at least try to\r\naddress this aspect of sanctions as well.\r\nFurthermore, questions related to large-scale migration,\r\nrefugees and displaced persons require our urgent attention.\r\nThe international community should set forth appropriate\r\nrules and standards regulating large-scale population\r\nmovements and seeking solutions for their root causes and\r\nconsequences.\r\nWe also feel responsible for the most vulnerable\r\nsegments of the world population - the women, the children,\r\nthe disabled and the aged. We are ready to take part in the\r\ninternational community’s efforts to seek means for\r\naddressing their needs and concerns.\r\nThe Slovak Republic is greatly interested in reinforcing\r\nthe role of the United Nations and enhancing its\r\neffectiveness and capacity for action. We wish to join the\r\nranks of those States that support the implementation of the\r\nreform process of the United Nations in order to transform\r\nit into a more effective and economical organization. Its\r\norganizational structure should respond more adequately to\r\ncurrent global realities.\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nSlovakia is prepared to deliberate on proposals made by\r\nother members of the world community, including the\r\nproposal to restructure the Security Council, which should\r\nmaintain its representativity and at the same time its\r\ntransparent character. We are of the opinion that countries\r\nsuch as Germany and Japan should be invited to assume the\r\nresponsibilities of permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil. At the same time, the Slovak Republic observes\r\nthat the number of States able to contribute - owing to their\r\ngrowing economic influence and role in world affairs - to\r\nthe objectives of the United Nations is increasing. Any\r\ndecision on the composition of the Security Council should\r\nbe the result of a democratic discussion. An expansion of\r\nthe Security Council must not jeopardize its effectiveness\r\nand operational capability.\r\nThe General Assembly itself, in our opinion, should\r\nalso play a more important role within the United Nations\r\nsystem. The reform of the Economic and Social Council\r\nshould continue, with a view to avoiding duplication between\r\nthe Council and General Assembly agendas. Cost reductions\r\ncan also be made in the activities of the United Nations\r\nSecretariat. When this issue is considered, it should be\r\nborne in mind that the Secretariat executes its tasks in\r\nresponse to the requirements of the Member States.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations should be carried out\r\nin the context of the financial situation of the Organization.\r\nWe consider the change in the financing principles\r\nunderlying the United Nations regular budget and the budget\r\nof peace-keeping operations to be one of the most significant\r\naspects of this restructuring. The Member States should\r\nmeet their financial obligations to the United Nations fully\r\nand in due time. We believe, however, that the rules for\r\ndetermining the contributions of Member States to the\r\nUnited Nations budget should be made more flexible in\r\norder to accommodate changes in the economies of\r\nindividual Member States. The present economic reality,\r\nrather than history, should become the main and decisive\r\ncriterion.\r\nLet me conclude by wishing the General Assembly\r\nevery success in the demanding work that is ahead of it at\r\nthis session.\r\nPROGRAMME OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Before calling on the next speaker,\r\nI should like to inform delegations that I have received a\r\nletter dated 1 October 1993 from Mr. Ibrahim Gambari,\r\nChairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid,\r\nrequesting that the General Assembly take up consideration\r\nof agenda item 38, \"Elimination of apartheid and\r\nestablishment of a united, democratic and non-racial South\r\nAfrica\", during the period of the general debate in order to\r\nconsider a draft resolution on the lifting of all economic\r\nsanctions against South Africa.\r\nThe request has been submitted following a ministerial\r\nmeeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity on 29 September 1993, which\r\ncalled on the international community to respond positively\r\nto the appeal for the lifting of sanctions.\r\nIn the light of the request by the Chairman of the\r\nSpecial Committee, I intend to hold consultations with a\r\nview to bringing the matter before the General Assembly as\r\nquickly as possible, without, however, disrupting the work\r\nof the Assembly during the general debate.\r\nThe request by the Chairman of the Special Committee,\r\nwhich has been supported by the Chairman of the Group of\r\nAfrican States, for early consideration of a draft resolution\r\non the lifting of all economic sanctions against South Africa\r\nis, of course, without prejudice to the scheduling of the\r\nconsideration of the agenda item on apartheid later in the\r\nsession.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. ABREU (Uruguay) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMr. President, Uruguay wishes to express its satisfaction,\r\nand its trust in you, upon your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and as a representative of our region.\r\nYour capabilities are recognized by all, and your sense of\r\nimpartiality and justice are the best guarantee of success in\r\nthe important work entrusted to us.\r\nWe also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General on\r\nhis work over the last year, which was clearly described in\r\nhis report to the General Assembly. His personal leadership\r\nand decisiveness certainly contribute to international peace\r\nand security.\r\nFinally, we are happy to welcome the Czech Republic,\r\nthe Slovak Republic, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Monaco, Eritrea and Andorra as new Member\r\nStates. We are pleased to see this confirmation of the\r\nOrganization’s dedication to universality and openness, as\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 13\r\ngiven form in Article 4 of the Charter, to which Uruguay has\r\nalways adhered.\r\nIdeological concepts are today lagging behind a reality\r\nthat persists in reaffirming the validity of freedom as a point\r\nof reference in every effort to regain and preserve human\r\ndignity. The great challenge of our time is to find a\r\ncollective answer to the dizzying changes that are occurring\r\nas this century comes to its close. The technological\r\nrevolution and the spread of democracy are the two factors\r\nthat will empower humankind in its most genuine flowering.\r\nIn the political field, the new international order that we\r\nare seeing emerge is nourished by the fall of political and\r\nmilitary blocs, the collapse of ideological borders and a\r\ndeepening of disarmament. Cooperation is replacing\r\nconfrontation. The elements of power are being reallocated\r\nin the light of the new variables that offer a renewed\r\nchallenge to the multilateral organizations in the international\r\narena.\r\nIn the economic field, technological development has\r\nreplaced traditional comparative advantages with\r\ncompetitiveness and excellence. Quality is the basis for the\r\nproduction of goods and services. These trends, if stripped\r\nof their human element, would be little more than a\r\nmaterialistic expression lacking the necessary sense of\r\nsolidarity. A new order cannot be summed up simply as a\r\nreallocation of the outward expressions of power. The\r\nglobal nature and the interdependence that characterize\r\ninternational relations today find their ethical content and\r\nlegal expression in the continuing validity of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nIn this context, we are facing today new horizons and\r\nbetter prospects for understanding between nations. In this\r\nrespect, we hail with particular satisfaction the peace reached\r\nin the Middle East between the State of Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization, and we welcome it as an\r\nexample and symbol of the new era of cooperation which\r\nnations must carry forward on the threshold of the new\r\ncentury.\r\nAlso, within the Latin American region, Uruguay is\r\npleased to point to the consolidation of the peace processes\r\nin El Salvador and Guatemala. This has been achieved\r\nthrough the efforts made by their peoples and Governments,\r\nwith the constant support of the international community.\r\nThe practice of direct diplomacy, with mechanisms for\r\npolitical consultation and coordination, has been successful.\r\nIn this context, Uruguay wishes to stress the role played by\r\nthe Organization of American States in the grave crises\r\nsuffered by Peru, Guatemala and Haiti.\r\nWe can add little to a diagnosis on which we all agree.\r\nOur responsibility lies in our capacity to propose solutions,\r\nboth in our own domestic spheres and internationally; this is\r\na challenge that every generation faces, taking national\r\nfeelings as the basis for a leap forward towards prosperity\r\nand the expression of the international community as a basis\r\nfor the credibility that nurtures the hopes of the great\r\ndispossessed majorities.\r\nUruguay wishes here to emphasize three particularly\r\nimportant issues: the relationship between international\r\ntrade, development and political stability; the new\r\narticulation of the concept of collective security; and, lastly,\r\nthe problems of human rights and the environment as part of\r\nbroadening the concept of integral development.\r\nThe dissoluble interdependence between development\r\nand political stability is obvious. Freedom in its most\r\ncomplete expression admits of no ambiguous interpretation.\r\nAnd, just as human rights cannot be subject to the whims of\r\nGovernments, neither can free trade be limited by the\r\npressures of national or sectoral interests. Political freedom\r\nand free trade are two sides of the same coin.\r\nThe opening of markets between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries cannot therefore be seen as a zero-sum\r\nexercise; rather, it is an undertaking of benefit to all.\r\nGreater competitiveness powers the process that begins with\r\ngrowth, is strengthened by a better distribution of wealth and\r\nis consolidated by the credibility of democracy and its\r\ninstitutions. This shared responsibility makes no allowance\r\nfor double-talk from any side.\r\nIn our capacity as Chairman of the Negotiating\r\nCommittee of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement\r\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at the ministerial level, we\r\nwish to express our concern over the obstacles in the way of\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nconcluding the Round. After seven long years of\r\nnegotiations, certain trends continue to obstruct the\r\nmultilateralization process. Bilateral negotiations are\r\ncurtailing opportunities for reaching a comprehensive,\r\nbalanced result that takes into account all the interests at\r\nstake, and particularly those of the developing countries, in\r\naccordance with GATT’s own norms.\r\nFor several years now Uruguay has been working hard\r\nto make structural adjustments in its economy. Policies to\r\nmake trade more open, both domestically and internationally,\r\nhave been put in place with the aim of modernizing the\r\nindustrial sector, facilitating technological innovation and\r\nincreasing competitiveness so as to achieve, in the final\r\nanalysis, a more efficient integration into the world economy\r\nand world trade.\r\nDeregulation of production, reform and modernization\r\nof the public sector as well as strict fiscal adjustments aimed\r\nat balancing the use of the country’s financial and monetary\r\nresources have supplemented external liberalization policies\r\nwhich have placed us among those who have reduced tariff\r\nand non-tariff barriers at the fastest rate.\r\nThis great effort of adjustment carried out by Uruguay\r\n- in a similar fashion to many other developing countries -\r\nhas been achieved not only in the framework of deep social,\r\neconomic and political difficulties, but has also been\r\nundertaken unilaterally without any compensation at all from\r\nits partners in the international system, especially the more\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nThus Uruguay emphasizes once again its firmest\r\nrejection of all protectionist policies which continue to be\r\napplied by some highly industrialized countries. These are\r\nclearly incompatible with the rules of GATT and with the\r\nstatus quo commitments agreed at the beginning of the\r\nUruguay Round. At the same time, they are a disincentive\r\nfor the efforts made in the framework of democracy to\r\nstrengthen institutions and to have an appropriate social\r\ndialogue.\r\nIt is disquieting to witness the behaviour of many\r\ncountries which preach the virtues and benefits of the free\r\nmarket and economic liberalism but at the same time close\r\ntheir borders to trade from countries whose well-being\r\ndepends to a significant degree on access to such markets.\r\nTherefore, Uruguay calls once again and most\r\nemphatically on all nations, especially the major trading\r\npartners, to make possible a successful conclusion of the\r\nUruguay Round negotiations, in which comprehensiveness\r\nand balance are values to be preserved in a strengthened\r\nmultilateral framework.\r\nIn this context, Uruguay also believes that regional\r\nintegration is the best path towards international\r\nparticipation. Today nothing can be done individually.\r\nInterrelationships exist between large economic blocs; no\r\ncountry can escape that reality.\r\nThe creation of economic blocs must be interpreted as\r\na consequence of a process of integration and liberalization\r\nof world markets. Blocs are a tangible approximation, an\r\nintermediate step, to the goal of free trade, the ultimate goal\r\nof GATT. Furthermore, this is the thrust of Uruguay’s\r\nresolute participation in the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR) and of the integration efforts of the North\r\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, the Group of Three, the\r\nAndean Pact and the bilateral agreements within the Latin\r\nAmerican Integration Association.\r\nUruguay recognizes that the new concept of\r\ninternational security includes institutional, legal and political\r\naspects. From an institutional standpoint, we must avoid\r\nextensive use of the powers of the Security Council based on\r\na sense of pragmatism that might undermine the criteria\r\ngoverning the delicate balance between the main organs of\r\nthe United Nations. The disappearance of bipolarity enables\r\na new political reality to pervade the Council’s decisions. If,\r\non the one hand, the traditional situations caused by the cold\r\nwar have been unblocked, on the other hand, there must be\r\ncareful control of the trend towards possible excesses of\r\npower by those nations enjoying a privileged situation.\r\nUruguay shares the thoughts of the Secretary-General\r\nexpressed in paragraph 80 of his document \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\" (A/47/277):\r\n\"The powerful must resist the dual but opposite calls of\r\nunilateralism and isolationism if the United Nations is\r\nto succeed.\"\r\nThe General Assembly must reassert its authority on the\r\nbasis of the Articles of the Charter which define its functions\r\nand powers. In the area of peace and security, the General\r\nAssembly’s constitutional limitations are set out in Articles\r\n12, 24 and 36 of the Charter. These we abide by.\r\nNevertheless, its primacy is clear in the economic and social\r\nareas.\r\nTo revitalize the General Assembly is to identify its\r\noriginal mandate, reaffirming its areas of authority and\r\ngiving this organ, in which we are all permanently\r\nrepresented, stronger involvement in the Organization’s\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 15\r\nactivities. This is the way to contribute to equity and the\r\nbalance of power established by the Charter. We also\r\nbelieve in strengthening the International Court of Justice,\r\nboth in its administrative and consultative functions.\r\nWhat I have said does not weaken our support for\r\nadapting the Security Council to the new international reality\r\nby reforming its composition and working methods. This\r\nprocess must gain general consensus and respect the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States. Only in this\r\nway can we ensure greater representation, transparency and\r\nefficiency.\r\nWe also believe that all this energy for renewal must be\r\ninjected appropriately into the Organization’s bureaucracy.\r\nThe United Nations is the sum of its organs, including its\r\nspecialized agencies. An improvement in efficiency must go\r\nhand in hand with possible global transformations. We must\r\nstrive to rationalize our operational systems in order to\r\nstreamline administrative procedures, which often amass\r\nthrough inertia hundreds of initiatives which wander\r\naimlessly, at great cost, through the machinery of an\r\ninsatiable bureaucracy.\r\nInternational security also finds its most genuine\r\nexpression in strict compliance with international law. In\r\nthis context, which is fraught with uncertainty and\r\nunpredictable events, the principles of self-determination,\r\nnon-intervention, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the\r\nobservance of good faith in the fulfilment of international\r\nobligations must be interpreted not as concepts that are\r\nvague or not properly drawn up by a naive legal system, but\r\nas the pillars of international relations.\r\nIt is also out of political realism and pragmatism that\r\nUruguay turns to the law as the main shield for its defence.\r\nOur former Ambassador to the United Nations,\r\nDr. Carlos María Velázquez, has said that the small\r\ncountries\r\n\"need to know, for reasons of our true national interest,\r\nhow far we can go and - most important - where we\r\ncan be taken. Respect for the law and international\r\nbehaviour that follows legal rules are the only path\r\ntowards a consolidation of the values of culture,\r\nfreedom and dignity.\"\r\nUruguay, true to its tradition, continues to interpret\r\nArticle 51 of the Charter strictly and continues to claim the\r\ncompensation to which it is entitled under Article 50 as a\r\nconsequence of the losses caused by the Gulf War. It does\r\nso not only for material reasons, but because it believes that\r\ncollective security is based on the credibility of the rules that\r\nregulate it.\r\nJust as Uruguay is a jealous guardian of the principles\r\nof international law, it is genuinely open to all those\r\nundertakings which, in fulfilment of an international\r\nmandate, constitute an indispensable contribution to world\r\npeace and security. Thus, we believe that peace-keeping\r\noperations are an essential part of the multilateral policy of\r\nthe United Nations, without prejudice to the necessary efforts\r\nbeing made in the field of preventive diplomacy.\r\nMr. Nyakyi (United Republic of Tanzania), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nUruguay has increased the number of armed forces\r\npersonnel placed at the disposal of the United Nations. The\r\nnumbers are highly significant in relation to the country’s\r\npopulation and the size of its military. It has also expressed\r\nto the Secretary-General its readiness to host regional\r\ntraining centres for United Nations peace-keeping forces.\r\nOur armed forces adopt a professional approach to\r\npeace-keeping missions, in which they are representatives of\r\nthe international community. It gives them satisfaction to\r\nsee their efforts contributing to establishing peace between\r\nStates and to regional and national reconciliation, as in\r\nCambodia, where, at last, democratic values and respect for\r\nhuman rights prevail.\r\nWe are concerned, however, over the risk of these\r\noperations’ being discontinued because of delays in the\r\npayment of countries’ contributions. It would be contrary to\r\nthe principle of universality if, owing to these difficulties,\r\nonly countries with vast financial resources could participate\r\nin such operations.\r\nWe believe that this policy of collective security must\r\nbe supplemented by a policy of disarmament and a universal\r\nban on nuclear weapons. The signing of international\r\nnon-proliferation agreements and the adoption of the\r\nConvention banning chemical weapons, which was signed in\r\nParis last January, constitute progress in this field - progress\r\nthat we endorse. We are also pleased to highlight the\r\ncontribution of our neighbours Argentina, Brazil and the\r\nRepublic of Chile through their implementation of regional\r\nagreements aimed at ensuring the peaceful use of nuclear\r\nenergy and the non-proliferation of all types of weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nStability and balance are threatened by poverty on a\r\nvast scale - widespread and critical poverty. Social\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ndevelopment implies giving priority to social expenditure,\r\nbut only where this is made possible by real growth,\r\nallowing for a reduction of the voluntary sector that is\r\ndeveloping in many of our societies. Collective security, as\r\nwell as ethics, must be taken into account in our approach to\r\nthis entire problem. Uruguay therefore attaches great\r\nimportance to Chile’s welcome initiative in the convening of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development, to be held in\r\n1995. This will provide a great opportunity for serious study\r\nof the scope of the concept of social development.\r\nThe ultimate beneficiaries of the integral development\r\nof the nations of the international community must be man\r\nand his environment. We therefore wish to highlight here\r\nthe importance of action on issues related to human rights\r\nand preservation of the environment.\r\nAt present, technology and international peace and\r\nsecurity are based on a narrow interpretation of the concept\r\nof human rights. Words and speeches are useless if, as\r\nPresident Clinton suggested, while we are gathered at this\r\nGeneral Assembly thousands of children in the world are\r\ndying of hunger. What of the essence of democracy can we\r\nrescue if, as in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in many other\r\nplaces, we look on helplessly as people indulge in behaviour\r\nthat we thought had been eradicated for ever?\r\nThe concept of human rights - their intrinsic worth and\r\nnature - is not affected by political, religious, sectional or\r\neven State interests or considerations. The ethical heritage\r\nof contemporary international society cannot allow\r\nconcessions in the defence of these rights and principles.\r\nAny concession would affect the credibility of the\r\ninstitutions and values of freedom and human dignity as the\r\nbases of democracy.\r\nDuring the Vienna World Conference on Human\r\nRights, the States parties solemnly reaffirmed their\r\ncommitment to promoting respect for and protection of those\r\nrights. In this context, our country supports the\r\nestablishment of a high commissioner for human rights, in\r\nthe framework of the international system.\r\nMoreover, Uruguay repeats President Lacalle’s\r\nstatement to the Secretary-General of our country’s\r\nwillingness to help in the evacuation of children who are\r\ninnocent victims of hatred and intolerance. We hope that\r\ninertia will not prevail over political decisions or human\r\nsensitivity. Those who suffer and die in the midst of\r\ncollective insanity must not be held hostage to bureaucratic\r\nstructures. If this happens, the documents approved at the\r\nWorld Summit for Children in September 1990 will have\r\nbeen relegated to the rhetorical scrapheap of its meetings.\r\nIntegral development implies careful consideration of\r\nthe problems of the environment. The concept of sustainable\r\ndevelopment requires a link between environmental issues\r\nand economic and social issues. In this context, States must\r\nundertake bilateral and multilateral commitments, by means\r\nof conventions, going beyond mere statements. This is also\r\nan aspect of the North-South dialogue and of action to deal\r\nwith the conflicts of interests that it entails. Uruguay has\r\nincorporated in a cross-border agreement with Brazil the\r\nconcept of responsibility for environmental degradation. It\r\nwishes to reiterate the need to establish a legal system to\r\nresolve environmental disputes through codification of\r\ninternational environmental law, in the spirit of the\r\nresolution adopted at the Rio Summit in 1992.\r\nFinding a way to force States to accept responsibility\r\nfor non-compliance with the rules for protection of the\r\nenvironment continues to be the basis for a fair relationship\r\nbetween the industrialized countries and the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nSuch are the main issues of concern to Uruguay. In the\r\nframework of all the ambivalence, all the areas of light and\r\nshadow in the international arena, we are taking part in this\r\nsession of the General Assembly - as we have done since the\r\nfoundation of the United Nations - in the hope that deeds\r\nwill be shown to be more eloquent than words.\r\nMr. AL-THANI (Qatar) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to begin my statement by\r\ncongratulating Mr. Insanally of Guyana on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session\r\n- the \"session of peace\". This choice reflects the confidence\r\nof Member States in his political ability and diplomatic skill\r\nand their regard for his country. He will have our full\r\ncooperation and support. We are confident that, with his\r\nexperience and wisdom, he will lead us to success in our\r\nwork.\r\nI should like also to express to Mr. Insanally’s\r\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, our deep appreciation and\r\ngratitude for the excellent manner in which he conducted the\r\nwork of the General Assembly during its forty-seventh\r\nsession.\r\nIt also gives me great pleasure to welcome, in the name\r\nof the State of Qatar, all the States that recently joined this\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 17\r\ninternational Organization, which, session after session, has\r\nreaffirmed its universal character. We look forward to the\r\ncontribution of these States in an Organization that\r\nrepresents all nations of the world, without exception.\r\nOn this occasion, I should like to convey to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, my Government’s deep appreciation for his\r\ncommitment and dedication to the principles of the United\r\nNations, for the political ability and diplomatic skill that he\r\nhas demonstrated, since he assumed this high position, in\r\ndealing with international problems and crises, and for his\r\nunremitting efforts, his discernment and his farsightedness in\r\nrevitalizing this world Organization so that it may face up to\r\nthe challenges posed by a changing world and achieve peace\r\non earth. This is reflected in part by his praiseworthy report\r\nentitled \"Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277), which contains\r\nimportant proposals in the areas of preventive diplomacy,\r\npeacemaking and peace-keeping.\r\nThe new phase the world has embarked on after the end\r\nof the cold war and the emergence of new complexities in\r\ninternational relations, side by side with the deterioration of\r\nthe economic situation, especially in developing countries,\r\nnow face the United Nations with new burdens and\r\nresponsibilities, which necessitate the restructuring and\r\nrevitalization of the Organization in order for it to be able to\r\nmeet successfully the demands of a changing world. As\r\nsuch restructuring and revitalization should include the\r\nactivities of the United Nations in the areas of security and\r\nsocial and economic development, the State of Qatar\r\nbelieves that it is necessary to consider an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council in order to make the\r\nCouncil more representative of the international community,\r\nsince the number of Member States in the Organization has\r\nrisen, on the one hand, and the balance of power and\r\neconomic weight of some States have changed, on the other.\r\nSuch an increase should include both permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council, and there\r\nshould be adequate representation of each of the five\r\ncontinents. It is necessary, however, that the membership of\r\nthe Council should remain within the manageable limits that\r\nmay enable it to maintain its effectiveness in dealing with\r\nworld crises that are constantly increasing in gravity.\r\nSince the end of cold war and the disappearance of\r\nEast-West confrontation, major steps have been taken\r\ntowards arms limitation at the international level. Nuclear\r\narsenals have been reduced, nuclear tests have been frozen,\r\na Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\r\non Their Destruction, has been opened for signature and\r\nQatar was among the first to sign it. In this respect,\r\nhowever, I should like to stress a very important point,\r\nnamely that arms limitation, particularly with respect to\r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, should be\r\ngiven a high priority in the interests of the peace and\r\nstability of the States of the region so that the funds released\r\nthereby may be channelled to development and the\r\nachievement of economic and social progress. This,\r\nhowever, must apply to all the States of the region without\r\nexception. Consequently, it is my country’s view that it is\r\nimportant for all the States of the Middle East, without\r\nexception, to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons. Qatar supports all initiatives aimed at\r\nmaking the Middle East a region free from all nuclear and\r\nother weapons of mass destruction and their systems of\r\ndelivery, especially as we enter upon a new era of peace\r\nwhich, by its nature, contradicts the very idea of developing\r\nand stockpiling weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe State of Qatar is very much concerned about the\r\ninternational economic situation, believing that a stable\r\ninternational economic situation is the cornerstone for the\r\nbuilding of a new world order that could be characterized by\r\nstability, security and prosperity. We are particularly\r\nconcerned about the economic situation of developing\r\ncountries, most of which are suffering from a heavy burden\r\nof indebtedness, the service of which exhausts a large\r\nportion of their limited resources which are hardly sufficient\r\nto meet the needs of their struggling peoples. We therefore\r\nbelieve that addressing the problem of indebtedness is the\r\nfirst essential step towards strengthening the economies of\r\nthose countries. We know that there are numerous studies\r\nand propositions on this issue, but what is needed more are\r\nthe political will and genuine desire on the part of rich\r\ncreditor States to solve once and for all the problem of\r\nindebtedness in favour of developing countries, particularly\r\nthe African least-developed countries. Needless to say,\r\ncontinuing civil wars in the countries of the third world and\r\nconflicts among them have taken a heavy toll in the case of\r\nthose countries and their economies. Among those countries\r\nare those of the Gulf region which have had their share of\r\nsuffering because of recent crises and events in the Middle\r\nEast.\r\nThe security and stability of the Gulf region are the\r\nforemost objectives that the State of Qatar seeks to achieve\r\nby its efforts and contacts. Security and stability, as we all\r\nknow, are important not only to the States of the region, but\r\nalso to the entire world because of the region’s strategic\r\nimportance and its energy resources that the world needs.\r\nThe State of Qatar believes that this security and stability\r\ncannot be achieved other than by cooperation between the\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nStates of the region themselves on the basis of good\r\nneighbourliness, mutual respect, non-interference in internal\r\naffairs, respect for sovereignty and independence, respect for\r\nrecognized international borders and for the agreements\r\nconcluded among themselves, and the settlement of\r\ndifferences and of disputes by peaceful means, particularly\r\nthrough negotiation, mediation and international adjudication.\r\nFrom this perspective, the State of Qatar supports all\r\nefforts being made to solve the dispute over the three islands\r\nof Abu Mousa, Greater Tunb and Smaller Tunb between the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nthrough negotiation and by other peaceful means, in the hope\r\nthat these peaceful efforts will result in settling all\r\noutstanding issues between the two States. In this\r\nconnection, we welcome the recent statements by officials of\r\nboth countries in which they expressed their desire to resolve\r\nthe dispute by peaceful means through bilateral channels.\r\nBy the same token, the State of Qatar reiterates its full\r\nsupport for the sovereignty of the State of Kuwait and its\r\nterritorial integrity within its international boundaries as\r\ndemarcated by Security Council resolution 833 (1993) on the\r\nKuwait-Iraq boundaries. The State of Qatar also reaffirms\r\nits concern for the preservation of the territorial integrity of\r\nIraq and calls upon the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people,\r\nespecially in basic civilian and humanitarian areas. This\r\nrequires full compliance by Iraq with all the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council, first among which is\r\nresolution 687 (1991) in all its provisions.\r\nThe State of Qatar is following with great interest the\r\nsuccessive and positive developments in the march towards\r\npeace in the Middle East. These developments in our\r\nopinion turn a new page in the history of the region. We\r\nhave welcomed the agreement reached by the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and Israel concerning self-\r\ngovernment in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, as a first step\r\ntowards a just, complete and lasting solution to the\r\nPalestinian question and the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis\r\nof Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973),\r\nthe principle of land for peace, full Israeli withdrawal from\r\nall occupied Arab territories including the holy city of Al-\r\nQuds and the Golan Heights, southern Lebanon as well as\r\nthe occupied Jordanian territories, and the implementation of\r\nthe legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people,\r\nincluding the right of self-determination. This will lay the\r\nfoundation for security and stability in the Middle East. In\r\nthis respect, Qatar reiterates its continued support for the\r\npeace efforts undertaken according to and on the basis of the\r\nprinciples agreed upon. It looks forward to seeing the\r\nongoing negotiations make fundamental and parallel progress\r\non all tracks. Short of this, no real peace, in our view, could\r\nbe achieved in the region.\r\nWe also follow with hope and admiration the efforts by\r\nour sister country, Lebanon, towards political stability,\r\nsecurity and reconstruction. The State of Qatar will spare no\r\neffort in supporting Lebanon’s sovereignty and sharing in the\r\nreconstruction of that country in response to the call of\r\nbrotherhood. In this context, Qatar calls for full and\r\nunconditional implementation of Security Council resolution\r\n425 (1978).\r\nThe State of Qatar, which condemns terrorism in any\r\nshape or form, values greatly the question of human rights.\r\nThis stems from Qatar’s belief in the dignity of man and its\r\nadherence to the eternal principles of Islamic Sharia, which\r\nuphold the right of the individual to a decent life of freedom,\r\njustice, peace, brotherhood and the equality of all men.\r\nGiven this belief, Qatar views human rights as a high moral\r\nvalue that should not be used as a means of or a pretext for\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States, and an\r\nissue that should not be addressed by varying standards that\r\ndiffer from the case of one State to the other. In view of the\r\nuniversal character of human rights, their basic principles\r\nshould include the right to self-determination and the\r\ninherent link between human rights and the right to\r\ndevelopment. In view of the fact that each society has its\r\nown customs, traditions, culture and principles which it\r\ncherishes and adheres to in line with its creed and outlook,\r\nconsideration should be given to the historical and cultural\r\nframeworks of the Arab and Islamic world as well as to\r\nthose of other cultures and civilizations. Here I should like\r\nto point out with justified pride that Islam, 14 centuries ago,\r\nupheld the right of the individual to live in peace, freedom\r\nand dignity. This is the true picture of human rights in\r\nIslam.\r\nThe international community, as represented by the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, has condemned\r\nthe Serbian aggression in the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the unprecedented practice of \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\" of which the Bosnian Muslim people was the\r\nvictim. But what use condemnation? Condemnation has\r\nhad no effect whatsoever, as it has not been backed by\r\naction: the successive resolutions adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil have remained ineffective; aggression did not stop;\r\n\"ethnic cleansing\" continued, the safe areas have not been\r\nsafe and even relief assistance did not reach the people in\r\nthe besieged cities and areas. Yet, the Security Council has\r\nnot taken the necessary steps to enforce compliance with its\r\nresolutions as it has done in other cases. Even the arms\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 19\r\nembargo the Council imposed on the former Yugoslavia was\r\nnot lifted in the case of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina regardless of the fact that lifting it would\r\nenable the Bosnians to exercise their legitimate right of\r\nself-defence; nor were the offers of some Islamic States to\r\nsend forces to take part in protecting the safe areas accepted.\r\nNow, if this painful situation does not change and if the\r\nnecessary measures to enforce these resolutions are not\r\ntaken, history will record our disgraceful failure to uphold\r\nthe principles of the Charter and to force aggressors to\r\nrespect the norms of international legality. Besides, we must\r\nnot forget that it is important not to allow such grave\r\nviolations to continue to be committed with impunity. These\r\nviolations are crimes against humanity and, therefore, the\r\nState of Qatar fully supports the resolution relating to the\r\nestablishment of the International Tribunal to prosecute war\r\ncrimes in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe State of Qatar follows with great interest the\r\ndevelopments in the Russian Federation. We hope that that\r\nFederation will overcome its crises so that it may continue\r\nto perform its important role in resolving global crises in its\r\ncapacity as a permanent member of the Security Council, a\r\nco-sponsor of the peace negotiations in the Middle East and\r\na participant that has taken significant steps in the area of\r\nlimiting nuclear armaments.\r\nQatar supports the United Nations operation in our\r\nsister country, Somalia, and welcomes the determination of\r\nthe world Organization to continue this operation, which\r\naims at restoring peace and security in that country and at\r\nthe reconstruction of its State institutions in spite of all the\r\ndifficulties. We call upon the Somali leaderships to continue\r\nthe process of national reconciliation, to support the United\r\nNations efforts, to play their role in the process of political\r\nreconstruction and to refrain from doing anything that would\r\nobstruct that process.\r\nThe State of Qatar follows with interest the historic\r\npositive developments taking place in the Republic of South\r\nAfrica, and welcomes the progress that has been made\r\ntowards the final dismantling of the hideous system of\r\napartheid and the establishment of a democratic system for\r\nthe first time in the history of that country. While\r\nwelcoming these important developments in the political\r\narena in this Republic, Qatar supports the call by Mr. Nelson\r\nMandela, president of the African National Congress, for\r\nlifting the economic sanctions imposed on his country and\r\nfrom which its people have been suffering for years. This,\r\nin our opinion, would promote the democratic process and\r\nconsolidate economic development in that country.\r\nStability of the situation in South-East Asia was among\r\nthe positive results we have witnessed in the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflicts. This was achieved by resolving the\r\nconflict in Cambodia, drafting the new constitution and\r\nrestoring the monarchy. This peace was achieved after long\r\nyears of persistent struggle under the leadership of Norodom\r\nSihanouk for establishing peace and security in the country\r\nand restoring its territorial integrity and its sovereignty over\r\nits whole territory. In this connection, we commend the\r\ncontinuous efforts made by the United Nations and its\r\nSecretary-General, efforts that paved the way for elections\r\nand led to success of the peace process in Cambodia.\r\nThe last decade has witnessed increasing interest in\r\nenvironmental issues at both the official and popular levels.\r\nIndeed, the environment has become a high priority on the\r\nagendas of States and an integral part of their national\r\ninterests and security. This is a positive and necessary\r\ndevelopment. It is, however, most important in this respect\r\nto identify precisely the sources of pollution and the\r\nrelationship between the environment and economic\r\ndevelopment. The imposition of an energy tax at the present\r\ntime would limit the possibilities of development in the State\r\nof Qatar and other oil-exporting States. It would affect\r\nadversely their ability to meet their obligations and limit\r\ntheir ability to finance the exploration and production\r\noperations that would enable them as producers to satisfy the\r\nincreasing demand on oil. In an independent world, such\r\nnegative effects will not be limited to the oil-exporting\r\ncountries but will extend to other countries and to other\r\neconomic sectors all over the world. It is obvious that the\r\nidea of an energy tax on exporting countries is unfair both\r\nin its proposed rates on the sources of environmental\r\npollution and in comparison with other sources of pollution,\r\nsuch as coal. The negative environmental effects of the use\r\nof coal far exceed those of the use of oil. Notwithstanding\r\nsuch facts, however, we find that the tax rates have been\r\nproposed in the reverse ratio to the effects of the pollutants.\r\nOn the other hand, the proposed tax does not take into\r\nconsideration the amount of pollution caused by every\r\nindividual State. A single major industrial country may very\r\nwell pollute the environment to a far greater extent than any\r\nnumber of oil-producing countries put together. Regardless\r\nof this, however, the tax targets the latter in a manner that\r\nsuggests objectives other than the preservation of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nIt is no exaggeration to state that the world we all live\r\nin faces numerous challenges. The economic, social and\r\npolitical problems which face many countries in today’s\r\nworld have become so enormous and so complex that they\r\nmay well seem intractable. However, if we let ourselves be\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nguided by the spirit of the Charter and the principles of our\r\nworld Organization, and if we stand as one behind the\r\nUnited Nations, we are bound to find proper solutions to\r\nthose problems, which have become a common denominator\r\nto all the States of the world. There is no other way but to\r\nwork harder in the context of world solidarity and\r\ninternational cooperation towards the building of a world\r\nwherein the lights of peace, security, stability and well-being\r\nwould shine brightly.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. KENNEDY A. SIMMONDS, PRIME\r\nMINISTER AND MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\nOF SAINT KITTS AND NEVIS\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nMr. Kennedy A. Simmonds, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis, His Excellency the Honourable Mr.\r\nKennedy A. Simmonds, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. SIMMONDS (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I am\r\nextremely pleased to bring warm and cordial greetings from\r\nthe Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis. It is\r\nindeed with a profound sense of pleasure and honour that I\r\naddress this, the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations.\r\nFirst, I should like to express my sincere\r\ncongratulations and appreciation to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, for the very proficient and skilful manner\r\nin which he handled last year’s deliberations.\r\nI hasten to extend to you, Sir, our new President, a very\r\nhearty welcome. Your presence in the Chair is a source of\r\ngreat joy and pride to all of us from the Caribbean. I know\r\nthat you will bring your vast experience and great skill to\r\nbear on these proceedings. I wish to assure you of my\r\ncountry’s continued support and willing cooperation.\r\nI should also like to commend most highly our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose\r\ncommitment to the furtherance of the cause of peace,\r\nequality, freedom and democracy world wide stands out as\r\na testament to hope and prosperity in a time of conflict and\r\nsocial chaos.\r\nLast week the world was shocked by the tragedy of the\r\nearthquake which caused such extensive loss of life in India.\r\nI extend condolences to the Government and people of India\r\non behalf of the Government and people of Saint Kitts and\r\nNevis. I know that the world community will continue to\r\nrespond in appropriate measure with timely assistance.\r\nMy Government regrets the startling and violent events\r\nthat have been occurring in Russia over the past few days,\r\nand we express the hope that peace will quickly return and\r\nthat democracy will indeed come to the people of Russia.\r\nOn 19 September my country, Saint Kitts and Nevis,\r\ncelebrated the tenth anniversary of our independence. On 23\r\nSeptember it was 10 years since I had in this Hall\r\nannounced our nation to the world, indicating the principles\r\nthat would guide our participation in world affairs and the\r\nobjectives that we would pursue. The principles enunciated\r\nthen are timeless and unchanging, and I can only ask the\r\nAssembly to revisit them with me as I quote:\r\n\"The rights and freedoms embodied in the Constitution\r\nof Saint Kitts and Nevis reflect our commitment to the\r\nsanctity of human life, and of human dignity, the rights\r\nof the individual, and the non-violent pursuit of\r\nhappiness.\" (A/38/PV.3, p. 41)\r\nAt that time the East and the West stood precariously\r\nbalanced on the brink of the total nuclear annihilation of the\r\nhuman species. Today the world breathes a collective sigh\r\nof relief as the process of reducing nuclear armaments is\r\ngenuinely proceeding.\r\nInitially Saint Kitts and Nevis refused to sign the\r\nnuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Our position was a\r\nprincipled one, because while we supported the objective of\r\nstemming the spread of nuclear weapons among countries,\r\nwe felt that in practical terms it would be meaningless unless\r\nthose countries with the largest stockpiles of nuclear\r\nweapons made meaningful reductions in their arsenals.\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 21\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has now signed the Treaty. I call on\r\nall countries with nuclear weapons or the capacity to make\r\nthem to join in the global effort for the complete elimination\r\nof nuclear weapons.\r\nOur attention is focused now on conventional conflicts\r\nin various arenas. The fighting and the attendant atrocities\r\nreported from the theatre of conflict in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina represent a serious affront to every principle of\r\nhuman sanctity and human dignity that we share within this\r\nbody of nations. The United Nations is endeavouring to\r\nfulfil a humanitarian mission, but we must redouble our\r\nefforts to bring an end to the fighting. We cannot but\r\nexpress our condemnation and abhorrence at the atrocity of\r\n\"ethnic cleansing\" being attempted in that theatre of conflict.\r\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis appeals to all the\r\nparties involved in this brutal conflict to heed the call of the\r\ninternational community to broker a peaceful settlement and\r\nto respect the efforts of the United Nations to implement\r\neffective programmes aimed at ending the civil war and at\r\nproviding humanitarian assistance to those victims caught in\r\nthe crossfire.\r\nMy Government commends the efforts of the United\r\nNations in delivering humanitarian assistance to the people\r\nof Somalia who face the threat of disease, hunger, starvation\r\nand imminent death. At the same time, my Government\r\ndeplores the barbarous attacks on United Nations personnel\r\ndeployed in Somalia by forces loyal to Somali factions. We\r\nwould also like to add our voice in protest against the killing\r\nof 23 Pakistani peace-keeping soldiers, and others\r\nsubsequently. Although we would wish to see the\r\nperpetrators punished, it is our hope that the United Nations\r\nwill remain faithful to its original mandate to keep the peace\r\nand feed the hungry.\r\nMy country looks forward to an early end and a\r\npermanent solution that will permit the process of\r\ndevelopment to be resumed. We sincerely hope that this\r\ncrisis does not threaten the prospects for peace in the Horn\r\nof Africa.\r\nElsewhere in Africa hope has come alive. I refer in\r\nparticular to the developments in South Africa. The\r\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the\r\nannouncement of the prospects of non-racial and multi-party\r\nelections scheduled to take place in South Africa in April\r\nl994. The Caribbean has always been unambiguous and\r\nemphatic in its condemnation of apartheid. There is no\r\ndoubt that our commitment and our principled stand has\r\ncontributed to the inevitable dismantling of the unjust system\r\nof apartheid.\r\nWe are at the threshold of a new South Africa which\r\noffers to its people an unprecedented opportunity to write a\r\nnew chapter in the history of South Africa whereby the\r\neradication of apartheid could lead to the creation of a new,\r\nunited, non-racial and democratic society. We are extremely\r\nencouraged by the progress in the negotiations taking place\r\nbetween the Government of F. W. de Klerk, Nelson Mandela\r\nof the African National Congress (ANC), and members of\r\nother political parties in South Africa. While there are still\r\nmajor difficulties, we call upon all parties to seize this\r\nopportunity to bring peace and freedom to all South\r\nAfricans.\r\nHowever, Member Governments must maintain their\r\nvigilance until the Transitional Executive Council has been\r\nestablished, with the proper terms of reference clearly\r\noutlined and defined, to allow for the integration and active\r\nparticipation of all races within the developmental and\r\ngovernmental process of that country. But Saint Kitts and\r\nNevis supports Nelson Mandela’s call for the removal of\r\nsanctions at this time.\r\nThe involvement and influence of the United Nations in\r\nconflict resolution have been outstanding in recent times. In\r\nthis regard, my delegation wishes to applaud the timely\r\nefforts of the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS) to bring the relevant parties in the\r\nHaitian crisis to the negotiating table. My Government\r\nwelcomes the Governors Island Agreement brokered by the\r\nUnited Nations, which resulted in talks between\r\nPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the military high\r\ncommand in Haiti. The appointment and installation of\r\nPrime Minister Malval, who was chosen by President\r\nAristide, was a significant achievement.\r\nThe international community must provide support and\r\nsecurity to ensure the safe return of President Aristide,\r\nfollowing which a major development offensive, with\r\ninstitution-building, must be mounted and sustained. Haiti\r\nmust be given the same high priority as is accorded to other\r\nareas of conflict or poverty in the world.\r\nChanges in international affairs are taking place with a\r\nstartling rapidity and suddenness that could not possibly have\r\nbeen predicted. Who would have expected the surprising but\r\nvery welcome rapprochement between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which now offers\r\na genuine prospect for peace in the Middle East? The peace\r\nprospect is obviously very fragile, but we must all support\r\nit and give it every opportunity to prosper. The realities of\r\nthe present world situation call not for a hardening of\r\ntraditional attitudes, but for a genuine search for solutions,\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\neven if they require unprecedented approaches and\r\ncompromises.\r\nAlso in relation to that region, we welcome the\r\nfinalization of the demarcation of the boundary between\r\nKuwait and Iraq, which was accomplished by the Iraq-\r\nKuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission on 20 May\r\n1993. We also welcome the adoption by the Security\r\nCouncil of its resolution 833 (1993), in which it guaranteed\r\nthe inviolability of the boundary between the two States.\r\nWe expect that this guarantee will serve as a deterrent\r\nagainst future conflict between Kuwait and Iraq, and also\r\nenhance stability and security in the region. Iraq is called\r\nupon to respect the terms of Security Council resolution 833\r\n(1993) and other relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nWho would have predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall\r\nand the reunification of East and West Germany? Who\r\nwould have predicted the breakup of the Soviet Union and\r\nthe subsequent United Nations membership of a large\r\nnumber of new sovereign States? The United Nations has\r\nbeen in the midst of it all. We have welcomed the\r\nmembership of North and South Korea, ideological\r\ndifferences notwithstanding. And we support their efforts\r\ntowards reunification.\r\nIt is clear that membership in the United Nations is\r\nneither a deterrent to reunification, as we saw in the case of\r\nGermany, nor to fragmentation, as we saw in the case of the\r\nSoviet Union. Whatever the aspirations of a country’s\r\npeople, as determined by that people, these can be\r\naccommodated within the framework and forum of the\r\nUnited Nations, which is more effective as an organ\r\noperating by a process of inclusion than one operating by a\r\nprocess of exclusion.\r\nIn that context, my Government calls on the United\r\nNations to begin the process that would eventually lead to\r\nthe admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan into this\r\nOrganization. The Republic of China on Taiwan has proved\r\nitself to be a country that espouses the principles inherent in\r\nthe United Nations Charter, a country dedicated to peace,\r\nsocial tranquillity and economic development, not only for\r\nits people, but also for the peoples of other nations.\r\nI want to extend a warm welcome to those who have\r\nbecome Members of this august body and to congratulate\r\nthem on seeking membership within this brotherhood of\r\nnations. Membership itself implies an acceptance of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and a recognition of the importance\r\nof the Organization’s objectives. I want to assure these new\r\nMember States of my Government’s readiness to extend a\r\nwilling hand of friendship and cooperation as we work\r\ntogether to further the cause of global peace and human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis fully\r\nsubscribes to the policy of universality of membership. It is\r\nour strong belief that once a country satisfies the\r\nprerequisites for membership it should be allowed to join\r\nand to participate actively in the international fraternity of\r\nnations dedicated to upholding the principles of the Charter.\r\nIt is timely, in the context of membership, to examine\r\nthe issue of the planned restructuring of the United Nations.\r\nI would like to underscore the fact that the Government of\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is fully supportive of the movement\r\ntowards restructuring the United Nations with a view to\r\nensuring that such restructuring will lead to the creation of\r\nmore efficient and effective organs that are responsive to the\r\ndevelopment needs of States Members of the Organization.\r\nThis restructuring should include both the permanent and the\r\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council.\r\nAs we seek to proceed with plans for the restructuring\r\nof the United Nations, the Government of Saint Kitts and\r\nNevis wishes emphasis to be placed on ensuring that\r\nequitable geographic representation is seen to be encouraged,\r\nespecially in respect of decision-making and in respect of\r\npositions within the Secretariat. For too long, countries like\r\nmine in the Caribbean have not been adequately represented\r\nwithin the United Nations Secretariat. I wish to suggest\r\nalso that due consideration be given to the establishment of\r\na United Nations office in the eastern Caribbean to serve the\r\ninterests of the smaller island-States that comprise the\r\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).\r\nWe have looked at the questions of membership and\r\nrestructuring of the United Nations. It is important for us to\r\nreview the question of the mission of the Organization. The\r\nCharter calls for the promotion of the economic and social\r\nadvancement of all peoples. Ten years after our\r\nindependence, Saint Kitts and Nevis would like to remind\r\nthe Assembly of the mission as we perceived it then:\r\n\"We seek the establishment of a new international\r\neconomic order, for a redeployment of the world’s\r\nresources and for the implementation of mechanisms to\r\nincrease the flow of assistance towards the world’s\r\npoor.\" (A/38/PV.3, p. 42)\r\nWe ask ourselves: to what extent are these objectives\r\nbeing realized? To what extent is the mission being\r\nfulfilled? The answers are gravely disappointing. The new\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 23\r\ninternational economic order that seems to be emerging is\r\none in which the developed and the more powerful countries\r\nare creating mega-sized trading and economic blocs, and\r\nseeking to establish rules designed to secure their own\r\naggrandizement at the expense of small developing countries\r\nlike ours in the Caribbean, which are being quietly but\r\nsurely marginalized. We see the developed and powerful\r\ncountries seeking to redeploy the world’s resources, as found\r\nin the biodiversity of our forests and the vastness of the\r\nocean resources, for their own benefit, on the spurious\r\nground that the technology is theirs and not ours. We see\r\nflows of direct assistance to developing countries drying up,\r\nand more so for the countries of the Caribbean. It would\r\nappear that the hope of seeing this mission fulfilled is less\r\nrealizable now than it was 10 years ago.\r\nSome will say that the danger of nuclear war is\r\ndiminished. Some will say that many conflicts are being\r\nresolved, even though new ones are springing up. And\r\npeace is being realized in many former areas of conflict.\r\nThat is all true. The question remains, however: What sort\r\nof peace are we experiencing? Peace in Haiti is fragile;\r\npeace in the Middle East is uneasy; peace in Africa is\r\nunstable. I submit that the prospects for lasting peace would\r\nbe immeasurably enhanced if we sought to achieve that\r\npeace through development.\r\nPeace and development have always been linked, but\r\nthey are always portrayed as following parallel courses. My\r\ncountry contends that their paths must be merged and that\r\nwe must achieve the one, peace, as a consequence of the\r\nother, development - development which must be sustainable\r\nand sustained.\r\nIt is important that all sectors of our communities have\r\nthe opportunity to participate in the process of development\r\nand to enjoy its benefits. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, we\r\nensure as a matter of policy that women are empowered to\r\nbe effective participants in development. Our Ministry of\r\nWomen’s Affairs designs and implements programmes for\r\ntraining and mobilizing women in a variety of areas essential\r\nto the development of our country. This is an approach we\r\nrecommend to all developing countries as part of the process\r\nof maximizing our human resources.\r\nMy Government welcomes the call for a Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States, scheduled to convene in Barbados in\r\nApril 1994. We hope that this will result in tangible benefits\r\nfor the small island developing economies of the Caribbean\r\nand in a recognition of our special characteristics and needs.\r\nThere is developing in international affairs - in relation to\r\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the\r\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the\r\nEuropean Common Market and the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF) - a \"one size fits all\" mentality, or a \"one\r\nprescription for all countries approach\". These are obviously\r\nout of place in matters of development and human needs.\r\nThe peculiarities and differences which prompted the\r\nadoption of special economic arrangements - the Caribbean\r\nBasin Initiative, the Trade and Investment Agreement\r\nbetween Canada and the Caribbean Community Countries\r\n(CARIBCAN) and the Lomé Convention - are still very\r\npresent today, and are likely to remain so, because our\r\nislands are not going to become any larger. In fact, we\r\nsuffer from serious coastal erosion, which can be properly\r\naddressed only if substantial financial assistance is\r\nforthcoming.\r\nI appeal to the Member nations of this august body to\r\nrecognize also the fragility of our export commodities, such\r\nas sugar and bananas, as their producers represent the major\r\nemployers, and they are significant sources of foreign\r\nexchange, for many Caribbean countries. Any loss, no\r\nmatter how small, of the limited access which these products\r\nfrom the Caribbean enjoy could have catastrophic\r\nconsequences for the economies and lives of the people in\r\nthe Caribbean, and by extension could undermine the\r\nsocio-political tranquillity of the region.\r\nI cannot overemphasize the vulnerability of the\r\nCaribbean’s ecosystem and the need for constant vigilance\r\nwith respect to its protection and preservation. It is against\r\nthis backdrop that my Government, along with other\r\nGovernments of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM),\r\nstrongly condemns the transboundary movement of toxic\r\nwaste and of nuclear and other hazardous materials through\r\nthe Caribbean basin. We therefore call upon the\r\nindustrialized countries to refrain from exporting their waste\r\nto or through the Caribbean region. We also deplore the\r\ndumping of ship-generated waste in our Caribbean waters,\r\nand call upon all ships’ operators to discontinue the practice.\r\nThose waters are indeed a significant part of our economic\r\npatrimony.\r\nThe Rio Summit was a watershed for unprecedented\r\npartnership and international cooperation in the area of\r\nenvironmental protection. The approach that we as nations\r\nadopt on the environment should be modelled in such a way\r\nas to demonstrate our commitment to human development,\r\nenvironmental protection and sustainable growth.\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nI want to make a strong appeal to the industrialized\r\ncountries and the multilateral agencies to be more rational\r\nand more sensitive to the developmental needs of the\r\ndeveloping world, especially island communities, in their\r\napproach to dealing with the environment. Environmental\r\nconcerns must be appropriately considered within the context\r\nof sustainable development. The peoples of the developing\r\ncountries are entitled to an improved standard of life. The\r\nindustrialized North, therefore, should not use a single policy\r\non environment as a yardstick for assessing an individual\r\ncountry’s eligibility for developmental assistance.\r\nMy Government firmly believes that our environment\r\nmust be protected and preserved at all costs - not at the\r\nexpense of our people’s standard of living, but rather to\r\nenhance their quality of life. The desirability of\r\nenvironmental protection must be appropriately balanced\r\nagainst the imperatives of human development.\r\nThe problem of environmental degradation concerns a\r\nglobal common which we all share, and it is only through\r\ninternational collaboration and an adequate transfer of\r\ntechnical and financial assistance from developed to\r\ndeveloping countries that we can begin to arrest and, hence,\r\neventually solve this problem.\r\nWhile we attempt to harness our collective efforts to\r\nimprove the standard of living of our citizens, we are faced\r\nwith the increasing danger of drug trafficking and\r\nnarco-terrorism. We can ill afford to relax our resolve.\r\nWhile we seek peace on other fronts we must continue to\r\nwage war relentlessly on the illicit drug trade and those who\r\nwork so assiduously to bolster it. There is an urgent need\r\nfor greater financial assistance and technical expertise to\r\ncombat this problem. It is the children, the flower of our\r\nyouth, the promise of our nations’ tomorrows, who are being\r\ndestroyed today.\r\nAt the historic children’s Summit in 1990, we set\r\nourselves the task of creating a better world for children and\r\nof equipping them now to manage it in the future. The\r\nchallenge is vast, involving their educational, health,\r\nphysical, mental and psychological development, and we\r\nmust make ourselves equal to the task.\r\nThere can be no greater or more noble mission than to\r\nensure that our youth from developing nations, small or\r\nlarge, as from developed nations, is given every opportunity\r\nto aspire to a better quality of life. We can better achieve\r\nthis in a world of peace, and we can better realize and\r\nmaintain that peace through development.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Kennedy A. Simmonds, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nMr. NATCHABA (Togo) (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Togo, I should\r\nlike to convey very sincere condolences and feelings of\r\ncompassion to the people and the Government of India, who\r\nhave been so harshly afflicted by a cruel catastrophe.\r\nAllow me first of all to discharge the pleasant duty of\r\nexpressing to you, Mr. President, the warm congratulations\r\nof the Togo delegation on the unanimous confidence that has\r\nbeen invested in you by dint of your assumption of the lofty\r\nand noble task of conducting the debates of the current\r\nsession. You can count on my delegation’s full cooperation\r\nin the performance of the weighty responsibilities that fall to\r\nyou.\r\nMy delegation also congratulates the outgoing\r\nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who with great\r\nmastery and skill led the work of the forty-seventh session\r\nto success.\r\nTo our Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, I also wish to pay a well-\r\ndeserved tribute for the remarkable work he has been\r\ncarrying out since his election to the head of our\r\nOrganization. I should also like to reiterate to him our very\r\nsincere gratitude for his constant and tireless efforts to\r\nenhance the effectiveness of the Organization, particularly in\r\nthe field of peace-keeping and the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The firm determination he\r\nhas displayed in the restructuring of the United Nations to\r\nbetter adapt it to present-day realities has also won our\r\nadmiration.\r\nOur Organization is growing steadily, bringing us ever\r\ncloser to the goal of universality envisaged in the Charter of\r\nSan Francisco. Togo bids welcome to the new Members\r\nthat have joined the Organization this year, and we express\r\nto them our willingness to work in concert with them in\r\nbuilding a world of greater justice and solidarity.\r\nThe prevailing situation in the world today does not live\r\nup to the expectations engendered by the changes that\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 25\r\ntook place at the beginning of this decade. The hope of\r\nuniversal renewal characterized by the building of a world\r\nof peace, prosperity and justice, marked by reliable solidarity\r\nand more active cooperation among nations, has been slow\r\nin taking concrete form.\r\nThe grim picture seen in the tragedies unfolding before\r\nour eyes in Somalia, Liberia, Angola, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and elsewhere, as well as the persistence of the\r\ninternational economic crisis, leads one to believe that the\r\nfuture of the world is not as rosy as we had hoped. The\r\nnew order is still rather nebulous.\r\nNevertheless, we welcome the growing involvement of\r\nthe Organization in settling the various crises facing the\r\nworld. This bears witness to its new vitality and reflects the\r\ngrowing confidence that Member States place in multilateral\r\ncooperation.\r\nMr. Kasenda (Zaire), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nA year ago we noted from this same rostrum the\r\nupheavals that had occurred in recent years throughout the\r\nworld, particularly in Europe, Asia and Africa. Those signs\r\nof the times were then said to exemplify the determination\r\nof peoples to gain more freedom and full participation in the\r\nmanagement of political affairs.\r\nToday, more than ever before, those peoples are still\r\nsearching for that era of freedom, peace and justice that only\r\ndemocracy, stripped of all disguise and based on clearly\r\nunderstood and assimilated multi-party systems, can provide\r\nthem, with the support of the international community,\r\nthough without the need to yield to the temptation of\r\nimposing a uniform model.\r\nThis emancipation movement, to which the African\r\npeoples did not hesitate to adhere, has met with different\r\nfortunes in its various manifestations. While in certain\r\ncountries the transition towards democracy has unfolded\r\nsomewhat smoothly and has made it possible to bring about\r\ngenuine changes, in others the process has hardly achieved\r\nthe objectives so earnestly desired. This is true in some\r\ncountries of the African continent that, because of a lack of\r\nunderstanding between the various players, face enormous\r\ndifficulties that rend the fabric of society. Because of this\r\nlack of understanding, the aspiration of the African peoples\r\nto more freedom and democracy, though a legitimate one,\r\nhas unfortunately given rise here and there to a new type of\r\nproblem, on top of the continent’s usual troubles.\r\nIt is unfortunate that my country, Togo, has surely paid\r\na heavier price than others in the ineluctable march towards\r\ndemocratization. Indeed, no one can know the pain and\r\nsorrow of our people’s path in its progress towards\r\ndemocracy. Many difficulties arising from serious\r\nmisunderstandings between the players in national political\r\nlife regarding what democratization involves have dealt a\r\nheavy blow to the democratic process, which we had all\r\nhoped with all our hearts would be a peaceful one. This has\r\nled to a rare outbreak of political violence, which has\r\nravaged the whole of the national territory, unleashed serious\r\ndisruptions in the nation and displaced populations.\r\nIn the face of this worrisome situation that was\r\nthreatening national cohesion, the Government, anxious to do\r\neverything it could to bring the transition to culmination as\r\nquickly as possible, has made numerous efforts to find a\r\nsolution to the political crisis in which our country was\r\nplunged. In this spirit, it has done everything it can to\r\ncombat violence and insecurity by deploying the public\r\nsecurity forces in order to ensure, throughout the territory,\r\nthe peace and order that are indispensable for the free\r\nmovement of peoples and goods and the proper conduct of\r\nsocial, economic and political activity before, during and\r\nafter the electoral consultations.\r\nHowever, I hardly think it necessary to go on at great\r\nlength on this situation, because we were offered the means\r\nof a solution, and we did not fail to seize it. Thus, the\r\npeople of Togo have regained the hope and calm they so\r\nneeded in order to regain their confidence.\r\nThe elections of last 25 August - which were held, by\r\nand large, in a calm and serene atmosphere and transparency\r\nand in the presence of international observers - allowed our\r\npeople democratically to appoint the first President of the\r\nFourth Togolese Republic. Re-elected with a large majority\r\nof the votes cast, the outgoing President, General Gnassingbé\r\nEyadema, set as his main task to work tirelessly, in full\r\nrespect of human rights, for national reconciliation and the\r\nrecovery of the country’s economy, ruined by more than two\r\nyears of turbulent transition. He therefore called upon the\r\nsons of the nation to start with a clean slate, to forgive\r\nthemselves and unite in the struggle for the democratic\r\nprocess and the restoration of the country, in the interests of\r\nall. Certainly, some problems remain, but such problems are\r\ninherent to any apprenticeship. It is thus possible now to\r\nhope that Togo will be restored to its former health.\r\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn this connection, I am pleased to point out that, with\r\nregard to the forthcoming legislative elections, the\r\nGovernment has already taken steps to resolve all the\r\ntechnical problems connected with the organization of the\r\nelections so as to ensure that they are held in the greatest\r\npossible transparency. Aware that democracy requires the\r\ncooperation of all in the management of the polity’s affairs,\r\nthe Government intends to spare no effort to ensure the\r\nopposition’s participation in the forthcoming legislative\r\nelections.\r\nOur delegation should emphasize here the very useful\r\nrole played by friendly countries in the search for a\r\nsuccessful solution to the crisis in our country. I therefore\r\ntake the opportunity to thank from this rostrum all those\r\nwho, from near or far, contributed to our achievement of that\r\nresult. Our feelings of deep gratitude go out particularly to\r\nthe people, the Government and the Head of State of\r\nBurkina Faso, Mr. Blaise Compaoré, who applied all their\r\ntalents to bring about that which, several months earlier, still\r\nseemed impossible: bring our Togolese brothers around a\r\nnegotiating table and lead them to reach agreement.\r\nI also wish to welcome the sustained action undertaken\r\nby France, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United\r\nStates of America, whose mediation contributed to the\r\nfavourable outcome of the initiatives. My Government is\r\nparticularly grateful to the United Nations and to the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, whose observers in the field\r\nmade a very valuable contribution to the proper holding of\r\nthe elections of 25 August 1993. It is to be hoped that the\r\nresult of this process will be the restoration of national\r\ncohesion, allowing the Togolese henceforth to enjoy their\r\nrights fully and in all tranquillity, including their right to\r\nfundamental freedoms and to development.\r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, held in\r\nVienna from 14 to 25 June 1993, seems to have been an\r\neffort to produce international consensus on the further\r\npromotion, protection and defence of human rights. That\r\nmeeting enshrined the axiom, henceforth shared by all, that\r\ndevelopment, democracy and human rights form an\r\nindissociable triad.\r\nBut can we speak objectively of the effective enjoyment\r\nof human rights in the case of a population whose standards\r\nof living are below the necessary minimum? The rights to\r\nfood, education and adequate health care are in fact denied\r\nto the citizens of our developing countries, above all because\r\nof an unfavourable international economic situation. The\r\nfirst among human rights is the right to life - a decent life.\r\nTherefore, in the framework of promoting and protecting\r\nhuman rights, it is necessary to redouble efforts to help the\r\ndeveloping countries to assume their responsibility to\r\ncontribute to the full flowering of the individual.\r\nMy country, which is deeply devoted to respect for the\r\nhuman person and determined to build a State of law, has\r\nassumed as its own - by including them in its new\r\nConstitution, adopted by referendum on 27 September 1992 -\r\nthe fundamental principles of democracy and those linked\r\nto the protection and promotion of human rights. Once\r\nagain, I should like to affirm before this Assembly that Togo\r\nis firmly committed to all universal values encompassing the\r\nprotection and enjoyment of rights inherent to the human\r\nperson. It is thus with faith and conviction that I aver that\r\nthe difficulties of adapting national legislation to\r\ninternational norms and the various approaches available in\r\nno way detract from the duty of each State to contribute to\r\nthe tangible and irreversible progress of the cause of human\r\nrights throughout the world.\r\nThe end of the cold war and the disappearance of\r\nideological antagonisms have not yet made it possible to\r\nusher in the genuine era of peace to which the world aspired,\r\ndespite the encouraging prospects these changes seemed to\r\noffer. Indeed, narrow nationalism, religious fanaticism,\r\nethnic rivalry and hegemonism have resurfaced,\r\nunfortunately plunging certain parts of the world into\r\nturmoil.\r\nThus, in Africa, the situation remains disquieting\r\ndespite the praiseworthy efforts of the United Nations and\r\nthe Organization of African Unity to settle the conflicts\r\nravaging the continent. In Angola, it is unfortunate that war\r\npersists and continues to claim many victims, despite the\r\ninitiatives made to induce the belligerent brothers to lay\r\ndown their arms. I express the hope that both protagonists,\r\noverriding all other considerations, make as their main goals\r\nthe re-establishment of peace and the higher interests of the\r\nAngolan people, and renounce the use of force and find a\r\nfinal and negotiated solution to the conflict.\r\nIn South Africa, the positive progress achieved -\r\nparticularly the fixing of 27 April 1994 as the date for the\r\nholding of the first multiracial elections - clearly demonstrate\r\nthat the emergence of a democratic non-racial society in that\r\ncountry is near at hand. In that spirit, Togo welcomes the\r\nadoption in Cape Town on 23 September by the three houses\r\nof the South African Parliament of a bill instituting a\r\ntransitional executive council entrusted with helping and\r\ncontrolling governmental activities up to the elections.\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 27\r\nHowever, the noteworthy progress made recently\r\ntowards the complete and final dismantling of the apartheid\r\nsystem has been unable to disguise the various acts of\r\nviolence, aggression, confrontation and assassination that\r\nhave become daily features of South African political and\r\nsocial life. This increased violence, inspired and cunningly\r\nmaintained by groupings opposed to change, should prompt\r\nthe international community to do all in its power to ensure\r\nthe irreversibility of the process under way.\r\nThe Togolese Government takes note with interest of\r\nthe appeal made on 24 September by the President of the\r\nAfrican National Congress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, for the\r\nlifting of economic sanctions against South Africa. It is our\r\nhope that this measure will help to accelerate the democratic\r\nprocess in that country.\r\nIn Somalia, the deployment of the United Nations\r\nOperation has made it possible to alleviate the suffering of\r\nthe population. My delegation, while welcoming the efforts\r\nof the United Nations to restore normal living conditions,\r\nexpresses its grave concern at the enormous loss of life\r\namong the civilian populations and the Blue Helmets alike.\r\nGiven the present delicate situation there, it is\r\nimportant, as the Security Council unanimously urged on 22\r\nSeptember, to redouble efforts to reach a political settlement.\r\nTo that end, we cannot overemphasize the need to do\r\neverything possible to fulfil the objectives of the United\r\nNations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II), namely, the\r\n\"facilitation of humanitarian assistance and the\r\nrestoration of law and order, and of national\r\nreconciliation in a free, democratic and sovereign\r\nSomalia ...\". (Security Council resolution 865 (1993),\r\npara. 4.)\r\nAs for Liberia and Rwanda, which have for a number\r\nof years been arenas of cruel, fratricidal upheavals, Togo is\r\npleased to see that, thanks to the courage, farsightedness and\r\ndetermination of the parties concerned, there are finally some\r\nindications of genuine prospects for a final settlement of\r\nthose conflicts through, respectively, the Cotonou and\r\nArusha Agreements.\r\nIn the case of Liberia, in particular, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the arrangements made by the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the\r\nUnited Nations for the implementation of the Agreement of\r\n25 July so that the people of Liberia can once again live in\r\npeace and security and set about rebuilding their country in\r\nregained national unity.\r\nIn that connection, we believe that the role to be played\r\nby the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia\r\n(UNOMIL), established by the Security Council on 22\r\nSeptember of this year, will be a very decisive one.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Western Sahara, Togo\r\nwelcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General as set forth in\r\nhis report of 28 July 1993 (S/26185) on that question and\r\nurges him to pursue dialogue with the parties to the conflict\r\nin order to achieve implementation of the United Nations\r\nsettlement plan.\r\nThere are other regions of the world in which conflicts\r\nalso demand our attention and call for further efforts on our\r\npart to come up with adequate solutions.\r\nIn the case of the Middle East and the Israeli-Arab\r\nconflict, Togo welcomes the signing of the agreement on\r\nmutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and hails it as an important\r\nfirst step towards peace in the region. Today, that\r\nagreement and the one relating to Palestinian autonomy in\r\nthe Gaza Strip and Jericho are indications that things are\r\nfinally on the right track. My country is more than ever\r\nconvinced that only the final settlement of the Palestinian\r\nproblem can lead to peace in the region.\r\nTrue, there is still a long way to travel down the road\r\nto peace. In reaching that goal, the protagonists, both Arab\r\nand Israeli, need our material and moral support. The\r\nconsolidation of the process that has been set in motion\r\ndepends on the international community’s ability to respond\r\neffectively and urgently to the economic and social\r\ndevelopment needs of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, for\r\nonly viable development can ensure lasting peace in the\r\nregion.\r\nAs for the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I\r\nshould like, on behalf of the Togolese Government, to repeat\r\nhere our hope for the success of all the initiatives taken by\r\nall sides to end the tragedy in that country. No one in the\r\nworld can sleep peacefully in the knowledge of the anguish\r\nof the innocent victims of that conflict. To the protagonists\r\nwe say: Enough! Enough of dying! Be flexible, be\r\nreasonable.\r\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nFinally, with regard to Cambodia, Togo welcomes the\r\ninestimable peace-keeping efforts made by the United\r\nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC),\r\nwhich made it possible for free and democratic elections in\r\nthat country, under United Nations auspices, to be held in\r\nMay 1993.\r\nThe various conflicts that beset the world are directly\r\nrelated to the arms race. All countries are in duty bound to\r\nincrease their efforts to halt that race. At stake are the\r\nsurvival of mankind and national, regional and international\r\npeace and security.\r\nGeneral and complete disarmament - genuine\r\ndisarmament - for which all mankind so ardently hopes,\r\nrequires a substantial contribution from all Member States\r\nand the creation of appropriate structures. In this\r\nconnection, the action of the United Nations in this area\r\nshould be stepped up in order that the objectives of\r\ndisarmament can be achieved. The mission of the Regional\r\nDisarmament Centres should be viewed in the same context.\r\nIt is essential that they be made more operational by\r\nproviding them with adequate human, material and financial\r\nresources to enable them fully to discharge their duties.\r\nThe effectiveness of our Organization obviously\r\ndepends on restructuring and revitalizing it. My delegation,\r\nwhile welcoming the efforts already exerted in this\r\nconnection, believes that a review of the Charter is an\r\nimperative need in order to enable all the organs of the\r\nUnited Nations to participate fully in the implementation of\r\nits purposes and principles.\r\nThe time has come for the Organization to hew more\r\nclosely to the spirit of the Charter. My delegation therefore\r\nwarmly welcomes the proposals that there should be a\r\nrethinking of the membership of the Security Council with\r\na view to its expansion. In that endeavour it is important\r\nthat serious consideration be given to equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation of various regions so as to endow the\r\nuniversal Organization with a broader international consensus\r\nthat would provide a solid basis for its actions and make it\r\nmore dynamic, more active and more efficient.\r\nAs far as relations between States are concerned, the\r\nGovernment of Togo, in keeping with its policy of openness,\r\ndialogue and concerted action, firmly adheres to the\r\nprinciples of non-interference in the internal affairs of States\r\nand the non-use of force. Furthermore, we believe that,\r\ngiven the present state of international relations, the\r\nOrganization should help its Members to create domestic\r\nconditions that can contribute to the elimination of tensions\r\ncapable of leading to war either within or between States.\r\nIt was in that spirit that we welcomed last year the\r\nhighly pertinent recommendations formulated by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report, \"An Agenda for Peace\",\r\nwhich were aimed at the maintenance and restoration of\r\ninternational peace and security. Today more than ever\r\nbefore, the United Nations must strengthen its capacity to\r\nmaintain and preserve that peace and security, to ensure\r\nrespect for human rights and to promote economic and social\r\nprogress.\r\nThe economic and social gap between rich and poor\r\ncountries is growing wider by the day, and the economies of\r\nthe developing countries, particularly the least developed\r\namong them, are prey to chronic recession.\r\nIn Africa the situation is even more tragic. The peoples\r\nof Africa, already the victims of undernourishment, famine\r\nand all kinds of other ills, are also bearing the full brunt of\r\nthe constant decrease in export prices, the continuous\r\ndeterioration of terms of trade, the obstacles imposed on\r\ntrade, and the burden of indebtedness.\r\nIn the area of international trade, relationships are ruled\r\nby the law of the jungle. The persistence of protectionism\r\nand the adoption of Draconian measures against exports\r\nfrom developing countries continue to hamper the efforts\r\nthey are making to achieve growth through exports.\r\nIn the light of what I have just said, it is urgent for the\r\ninternational economic environment to be improved by\r\ndesigning a more open and transparent trading system. The\r\nsystem will have to protect and support the trading\r\nrelationships of the third world countries with the\r\nindustrialized countries and, moreover, make it possible for\r\ncountries with weak economies to come away from the\r\nsidelines and be fully integrated into the world economy.\r\nMy Government therefore wishes trade liberalization to\r\nlead to the establishment of principles of fair play that would\r\nimpel the countries of the North to buy the South’s products\r\nat remunerative prices. Towards this end, it is our hope that\r\nthe multilateral negotiations of the Uruguay Round will take\r\ninto account the concerns of the third world.\r\nThe debt problem remains a source of serious concern\r\nfor the African States, which are already being sorely tried\r\nby the effects of the world economic crisis. Africa, which\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 29\r\nis allocating more than half its income to servicing its debt,\r\nas required by the structural adjustment programmes, has\r\nbeen struggling for more than a decade now under an\r\neconomic shock therapy that leaves it no chance of success.\r\nUnfortunately, the many initiatives that have been taken to\r\npromote our countries’ development have so far not had\r\npositive results, as most of them have been implemented\r\nonly half-heartedly. This is particularly true of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s and the Paris Programme of Action for the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries for the 1990s.\r\nIn view of these considerations, my delegation would\r\nlike to recall that it is for the international community to\r\nadopt steps designed to alleviate the debt burden. These\r\nsteps should include, inter alia, writing off debt for\r\ndeveloping countries or, failing that, reducing it substantially,\r\nmaking repayment conditions more flexible, and setting up\r\nand paying into a diversification fund to transform the\r\ncommodities sector and stimulate economic growth in\r\nAfrica. There should also be a call for a considerable\r\nincrease in official development assistance.\r\nAs the 1980s were a lost decade for Africa, during the\r\n1990s the industrialized countries should agree to an increase\r\nin financial flows to the poorer countries sufficient to\r\nsupport their activities and programmes for development,\r\neconomic expansion and diversification, because it is a\r\nshame to see aid levels falling just when the African\r\ncountries are making major efforts to promote democracy\r\nand manage their economies in a sound and rigorous\r\nmanner. Of course, no one opts for democracy in the\r\nexpectation of preferential treatment, but particular attention\r\nshould be paid to our countries, which are already shaky as\r\na result of the general crisis that is rocking the world.\r\nAlthough we should stick to the rules of good economic\r\nmanagement, it would be a good thing if our countries,\r\nwhich are already in trouble, were not forced to submit to\r\nlong-drawn-out economic therapies that are quite likely to\r\nkill their efforts to become more democratic.\r\nSo, are we right to hope that the Tokyo Conference on\r\nAfrican development, which is going on right now, will\r\nmake it possible for us to drive it home to the major world\r\npolitical and economic players that there is a crying need to\r\nmake a massive, collective effort for African recovery,\r\nbecause Africa’s economy has fallen into wrack and ruin?\r\nForty-eight years after the Second World War, the world,\r\nwhich is still characterized by an attitude, on the part of the\r\nstrong, of moral indifference and hardness of heart towards\r\nthe weak, is still living in fear of what the next day will\r\nbring.\r\nHowever, despite the tough political, economic and\r\nsocial realities that all mankind is facing, we all do feel the\r\ncommonality of our peoples’ destiny and, without a doubt,\r\nthe relevance of the purpose and principles of our\r\nOrganization. Thus, we must turn the upheavals since the\r\nend of the cold war to advantage by building a new world\r\norder based on collective security on three levels - the\r\npolitical, the economic and the humanitarian - so as to bring\r\nabout better living conditions in greater liberty.\r\nTowards this end, the United Nations would gain by\r\nbeing reformed, made more democratic and revitalized in\r\norder to live up to its universal vocation and take up the\r\nmany challenges that a changing world is imposing on it.\r\nMr. JAMEEL (Maldives): It gives me great pleasure\r\nto congratulate Ambassador Insanally on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession. His election to this important post is, beyond a\r\ndoubt, a testimony to his personal credentials and the\r\nimportant role being played by his country in international\r\naffairs.\r\nI should also like to commend the work of his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, who\r\ndemonstrated outstanding skills of diplomacy, and\r\ndedication.\r\nIt is also my pleasant duty to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\nuntiring efforts in promoting international peace and security.\r\nI should also like to extend a warm welcome to the six\r\nnew States, Andorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, Monaco,\r\nthe Slovak Republic and the Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia that have joined us during the past year. I am\r\nconfident that their participation and contribution will further\r\nenrich the work of the Organization.\r\nAlong with the end of the cold war came promises:\r\npromises of a better future, without the threat of nuclear\r\nholocaust, where scarce resources would not be spent on\r\nbuilding up military might, where millions of starving would\r\nbe fed and provided with their basic health care needs, safe\r\ndrinking water and a basic level of education, where a safe\r\nand clean environment would be provided along with the\r\nright to sustainable development, and where the dignity of\r\nthe human being would be respected. This is the vision that\r\ngave rise to this Organization in 1945.\r\nWe have rededicated ourselves to this vision with\r\nrenewed vigour following the demise of the cold war. The\r\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nmoral authority of the United Nations has been reasserted\r\nover military might. A number of protracted conflicts have\r\nshown signs of movement towards resolution. International\r\ncooperation in addressing global issues such as environment,\r\ndisarmament, international peace and security and human\r\nrights have reached new heights. As a consequence, the\r\nUnited Nations has gained new respect and been entrusted\r\nwith new responsibilities. In order to live up to the\r\nheightened expectations, the Organization must continue to\r\nreceive the unwavering commitment of its Member States.\r\nThe Republic of Maldives would like to take this\r\nopportunity to renew its commitment to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThese changes in the work of the United Nations reflect\r\ncorresponding changes in the political, economic, and\r\nsecurity landscape that underpins efforts in international\r\ncooperation today. In view of this reality, the Security\r\nCouncil of the United Nations needs to be reformed and\r\nrestructured. We should be careful not to take a piecemeal\r\napproach to this: any expansion of the Council, and the\r\nstatus of the members, should be based on the principles of\r\nequitable and balanced representation. We should formulate\r\nprincipled criteria that reflect the political, economic and\r\ndemographic realities of the world today.\r\nThe events in Bosnia and Herzegovina have shamed us\r\nall. A State Member of the United Nations has been\r\nsubjected to naked aggression. The entire population of a\r\nsmall country is being progressively exterminated. It is\r\ndeliberate genocide.\r\nWe need to examine why the international community\r\nhas failed to stop the carnage that is taking place in that\r\ncountry. Regional, international and direct diplomacy have\r\nbeen applied, but to no avail. At a time when the world\r\ncommunity has rededicated itself to the sanctity of human\r\nrights, it is a tragic shame that systematic violation of these\r\nrights has gone unpunished owing to lack of will on the part\r\nof the international community.\r\nWe condemn the continued violence and genocide in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and call upon the international\r\ncommunity to take more decisive steps so that the\r\nresponsibilities entrusted to us under the Charter of this\r\nOrganization may be discharged fully. We fully recognize\r\nthe inherent right to self-defence, as prescribed in the\r\nCharter. We believe that the right to self-defence comprises\r\nthe most fundamental right - the right to life.\r\nA permanent solution to the situation in Bosnia should\r\nbe found by peaceful means and within the parameters of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, one of which is the principle\r\nof territorial integrity.\r\nThe continued violations of basic human rights that are\r\ntaking place in Angola and Somalia are a matter of serious\r\nconcern to us. The events in Somalia - especially the attacks\r\non the United Nations peace-keeping personnel - are grave\r\ndevelopments that threaten the working of this Organization.\r\nUnited Nations involvement in Somalia now raises several\r\nquestions, including those concerning the sincerity of the\r\nwarring parties with regard to their acceptance of help from\r\nthe international community to overcome the extreme\r\npoverty that has ravaged the entire country.\r\nToday, the United Nations is learning a lesson that is\r\nvery expensive, in terms of both human life and financial\r\nresources, as it provides humanitarian assistance and seeks\r\nto protect the people of these countries. It is indeed ironic\r\nand tragic that peace- keepers have themselves become\r\ntargets of violence. My Government condemns such\r\nviolence in the strongest possible terms and believes that\r\nthose responsible for such acts should be brought to justice.\r\nThese experiences demonstrate that if the parties\r\ninvolved are not sincere in the efforts to find a peaceful\r\nsolution and to avoid violence, the United Nations, acting on\r\nits own, will be unable to perform miracles.\r\nDevelopments taking place in South Africa have been\r\nencouraging. The very active and high-level role currently\r\nbeing played by the United Nations in facilitating the\r\ncessation of political violence and the promotion of\r\nnegotiations to establish a democratic and non-racial State in\r\nSouth Africa is commendable. My Government also\r\ncommends the African National Congress (ANC) and the\r\nGovernment of South Africa for their positive attitude\r\ntowards working out the details of the multi-party elections.\r\nIn this connection, the recent agreement to set up a\r\nmulti-party Transitional Executive Council is a welcome\r\ndevelopment. We feel that the end of the era of apartheid,\r\nwhich is an affront to human dignity, is imminent. In this\r\ncontext, we urge all parties concerned to refrain from\r\nviolence and actions that would subvert the peace process.\r\nIt is our hope that when we meet here in New York\r\nnext year we shall have amongst us the true representatives\r\nof the South African people and that this Organization will\r\nbe able to benefit from their experience and knowledge.\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 31\r\nThe Arab-Israeli peace talks that began in 1991 have\r\nmade remarkable progress. The signing of the declarations\r\nof principles by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\r\nand Israel in Washington last month was an historic event.\r\nIn this context, I should like to express to the PLO and the\r\npeople of Palestine our admiration for their courage and their\r\ndetermination to find a comprehensive and peaceful solution\r\nto the question of Palestine.\r\nThe Maldives pays tribute also to the Government of\r\nthe United States of America and other Governments\r\ninvolved for the important role they are playing in the\r\nMiddle East peace talks. It is our earnest hope that this\r\nagreement will lead to the restoration of the inalienable right\r\nof the Palestine people to self-determination, sovereign\r\nindependence and the establishment of a national homeland\r\non their own soil.\r\nThe tragic consequences of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait\r\nare still a matter of serious concern to the international\r\ncommunity. All outstanding issues, such as the border\r\ndispute and the release of Kuwaiti and third-country\r\nprisoners still being held in Iraqi jails, should be settled\r\nimmediately. The resolution of these issues, in conformity\r\nwith international law and practice, will contribute to the\r\nelimination of tension and to the restoration of security and\r\nstability in the region.\r\nIn this regard, the Government of Maldives welcomes\r\nthe completion of the work of the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary\r\nDemarcation Commission and the endorsement of the report\r\nof this Commission by the Security Council. We also feel\r\nthat Kuwait’s acceptance of the Commission’s report is a\r\nvery positive step indicative of that country’s eagerness and\r\nsincerity in its attitude towards a comprehensive solution.\r\nThe Government of Maldives urges Iraq to adopt an equally\r\npositive attitude in the interests of peace, security and\r\nstability.\r\nIn June this year the international community came\r\ntogether at the second World Conference on Human Rights\r\nto review and assess progress and setbacks in the area of\r\nhuman rights since the adoption of the Universal Declaration\r\nin 1948. I am happy that we were able to make\r\nconsiderable progress in several key areas. We believe that\r\nsome of the achievements of this Conference will give new\r\nimpetus to the promotion of human rights throughout the\r\nworld. However, we all need to be very realistic in\r\naddressing this very important issue. The international\r\ncommunity should not let the promotion of human rights be\r\nused by a few as an excuse for imposing uniformity in\r\nhuman behaviour and thinking, at the expense of diversity.\r\nRather, it should emphasize the significance of the\r\nuniversality of human rights. We know only too well the\r\nfate of societies that try to impose uniform thinking and\r\nbehaviour on their peoples. Differences between individuals\r\nand societies should be valued. Such diversity enriches our\r\nfamily of nations.\r\nThe Government of Maldives has always attached great\r\nimportance to disarmament and international peace and\r\nsecurity. It is our firm belief that the production and\r\nstockpiling of armaments will only worsen the security of\r\nthe entire world. In this regard, Maldives calls upon the\r\ninternational community not to lose the current momentum\r\ntowards disarmament. We therefore urge the parties\r\ninvolved to continue to build upon past achievements,\r\nparticularly in the elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, the control of proliferation, the achievement of\r\ngreater transparency in armaments and the negotiation of\r\nother confidence-building measures.\r\nEarly this year, Maldives acceded to the Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production and\r\nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin\r\nWeapons and on Their Destruction, and, today, on behalf of\r\nthe Government of Maldives, I have signed the Convention.\r\nMaldives is not involved in the production and stockpiling\r\nof such weapons. My Government’s accession and signature\r\ntherefore demonstrate our commitment to supporting all\r\ninternational efforts to eradicate such weaponry.\r\nThe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was one of the\r\nfirst international Treaties to which my country became a\r\nparty after gaining its independence in 1965. Our\r\ncommitment to this Treaty is unwavering because we fully\r\nrealize the consequences of the proliferation of such\r\nweapons of mass destruction. My Government supports the\r\nindefinite extension of the Treaty beyond 1995. We believe\r\nthat, within its framework, progress could be made in the\r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of\r\npeace, for which my Government reiterates its full support.\r\nWe feel that the establishment of such zones will further\r\ncontribute to the promotion of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nI also wish to express my Government’s unqualified\r\nsupport for the total eradication of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, be it chemical, biological or nuclear, and to\r\nreiterate our call for the conclusion of effective agreements\r\non a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. In this\r\nconnection, the Government of Maldives commends the\r\nUnited States for its unilateral decision to extend its\r\nmoratorium on nuclear testing until the end of 1994.\r\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations recognizes the\r\ninherent rights of all States to self-defence. However, only\r\na privileged few possess the ability to provide for their own\r\nsecurity unilaterally. Small States which lack adequate\r\nfinancial resources for the acquisition of military equipment\r\nand face severe constraints in manpower are never in a\r\nposition to provide suitably for their own security. Any\r\nattempt by small States to build their military capabilities up\r\nto a level of even near self-reliance would be a mere waste\r\nof resources. The United Nations remains the only guarantor\r\nof security for the small States.\r\nIn the economic sphere, the world economy once again\r\nfailed to meet the expected rate of growth. It continues to\r\nbe characterized by deteriorating terms of trade for the\r\ndeveloping countries and rising protectionism in developed\r\ncountries. For decades the developing countries have sought\r\na new world economic order that would eliminate the\r\nimbalances existing in the present system. However, little\r\nhas been accomplished towards the attainment of this goal.\r\nThe scientific and technological gap between the developing\r\nand the developed countries is becoming ever wider. The\r\nflow of official development assistance has declined as a\r\nresult of the slow growth in the economies of the donor\r\ncountries.\r\nThe global arrangements and institutions established to\r\nmanage economic relations between States have not been\r\nable to lift the world from its present depression. This\r\nfailure has serious implications for the developing countries.\r\nIn order to avoid disastrous consequences, we call for an\r\nearly conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\r\n(GATT) that will set the tone for a future based on an open-\r\ntrading system.\r\nThe North-South dialogue must be reactivated on a new\r\nbasis comprising common interests and benefits and shared\r\nresponsibilities. Similarly, South-South cooperation must be\r\nintensified, allowing States to pool their resources and\r\npursue concrete development efforts within the framework\r\nof collective self-reliance and continued support for open\r\ntrading systems. The world cannot rise out of its economic\r\ndisarray and be assured of stability until the North and the\r\nSouth can together work out a system that encourages closer\r\neconomic relations and strengthens the North-South\r\nexchange.\r\nOne particular concept that needs emphasis is the\r\ninseparability of development from the equitable sharing of\r\nits fruits and its responsibilities. This twofold aspect of\r\ndevelopment must be pursued at one and the same time and\r\nwith equal intensity if development is to succeed. In this\r\nregard, let me reiterate my Government’s firm belief that\r\nsustainable development is the only way to guarantee\r\ncontinued life on this planet Earth. We need to accelerate\r\nour efforts to meet the commitments we made in Rio last\r\nyear. We call on all States urgently to ratify the climate\r\nConvention and the bio-diversity Convention. My\r\nGovernment is proud to announce that it was one of the first\r\nto ratify both these Conventions.\r\nThe establishment of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment is a welcome development. We commend the\r\nCommission for the very productive work accomplished at\r\nits first substantive session and hope that its future work will\r\nbe of the same high standard.\r\nThe preparatory work for the Global Conference for\r\nSmall Island States on Sustainable Development and its\r\nImplications began during this year. My country, as a small\r\nisland State, regards this Conference as a very important step\r\nin addressing and finding practical solutions to the unique\r\nproblems facing us in our developmental efforts. We hope\r\nthat the international community will continue to participate\r\nconstructively in the preparatory process and will participate\r\nin the Conference itself.\r\nThe responsibility that has been thrust upon us today is\r\ntremendous. The realization of the dreams of our peoples\r\nare in our hands. We cannot afford to be blind to the\r\ndesires of our peoples to be better fed, to have safer drinking\r\nwater, to have access to education and health-care needs and\r\nto be free from the prospect of nuclear holocaust and the\r\ndangers of environmental degradation. We cannot afford to\r\nbe embroiled in the build-up of stockpiles of armaments and\r\nweapons of mass destruction while our economies are the\r\nmain victims of these acquisitions for death and destruction.\r\nWe should rise above all this and become more human\r\nin all our endeavours. I have no doubt that together we can\r\nactually achieve the better future that has been promised to\r\nus.\r\nMr. MESFIN (Ethiopia): It gives me great pleasure to\r\ncongratulate Ambassador Insanally of Guyana on his election\r\nto the high office of the presidency of the forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI am also delighted to welcome the new Members of\r\nthe Organization. In this regard allow me to welcome\r\nespecially the State of Eritrea as a Member of the United\r\nNations. At the end of a cruel war the people of Eritrea\r\nexercised their right to self-determination and opted for\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 33\r\nsovereign statehood in a referendum which won praise from\r\nthe United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and\r\nother international organizations as being free and fair.\r\nAddis Ababa and Asmara took steps immediately to forge a\r\nnew era of close relationship and cooperation.\r\nThe healing of the wounds of war has progressed\r\ndramatically. Building for shared prosperity is progressing\r\nin earnest. Ethiopia believes that the spirit in which the\r\nEritrean problem was resolved, as well as the developments\r\ntaking place to forge a basis for permanent peace and all-\r\nround cooperation, is a unique manifestation of the era of\r\nchange from conflict to concord. Peace has provided us\r\nwith the opportunity to concentrate on reconstruction and lay\r\nthe groundwork for sustainable development in Ethiopia and\r\nin Eritrea.\r\nThe vision of the Ethiopian and Eritrean leaderships\r\nand peoples is for economic, social and cultural integration\r\nleading to political integration on a new plane. The\r\nleaderships of the two countries have a vision for expanding\r\nsuch integration to include the countries of the subregion.\r\nThe establishment of peace and stability is therefore a\r\npriority agenda in the coordinated efforts of our two\r\nGovernments and we are determined to pursue our\r\nobjectives, however difficult the hurdles may be.\r\nNevertheless, we recognize that the Ethiopian and Eritrean\r\nsituation does not cover all the hopes and expectations for\r\nthe changes that have taken place in the last few years.\r\nAs there are encouraging developments in some parts\r\nof the world, we are also witnessing painful situations in\r\nothers. The crisis in Somalia is a case in point. Since this\r\ncrisis is at the heart of my Government’s concerns, I would\r\nlike to beg the indulgence of this Assembly to take a few\r\nmoments to make a brief comment on the disturbing\r\ndevelopments there.\r\nIt is to be recalled that the Security Council’s decision\r\nto restore order and to open the channels for the delivery of\r\nhumanitarian aid was put into effect in December 1992 and\r\nthereafter. Immediate action was then taken to bring\r\ntogether the warring factions as well as representatives of\r\nvarious sectors of Somali society. The aim was to secure\r\ntheir agreement on a plan of action for the restoration of\r\npeace and the establishment of the structures of civil\r\nadministration. In particular, the reconciliation input of the\r\nhigh-level Horn of Africa Standing Committee on Somalia\r\nwas brought to bear at the Conference held in Addis Ababa\r\nin March of this year. An agreement was hammered out on\r\na series of measures leading to peace and political stability\r\nin the country. The main elements of the agreement\r\nincluded a cease-fire; a programme of disarmament; regional\r\nreconciliation; measures on finding a political solution to be\r\nachieved through the establishment of elected district and\r\nregional councils, to culminate in the establishment of a\r\ntransitional national council as the highest organ of state; and\r\nthe principles for the settlement of conflicts relating to\r\nproperty claims.\r\nConcurrently, the Addis Ababa agreement of March\r\n1993 provides for modalities of continuing humanitarian\r\nrelief and the initiation of rehabilitation as well as\r\nreconstruction programmes. The United Nations Operation\r\nin Somalia (UNOSOM) was to manage peace-keeping and\r\nthe maintenance of an appropriate environment for the\r\nexecution of rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes.\r\nIt was then hoped that implementation of the political\r\naspects of the Addis Ababa agreement would proceed as\r\nplanned.\r\nHowever, the Somali situation took a tragic turn,\r\nparticularly when, on 5 June this year, United Nations\r\npeace-keepers from Pakistan and many Somalis were killed.\r\nThat was a deplorable incident indeed, and we continue to\r\nbe seriously disturbed by the tragic events which have\r\nresulted since then in further loss of life with no apparent\r\nend to the crisis. Indeed, there is a deadlock and a dilemma\r\nas to how to overcome the impasse in Mogadishu.\r\nIn the view of my delegation, a thorough review of all\r\naspects of the Somali situation by the United Nations is\r\nimperative. Such a review should be aimed at restoring the\r\nsituation that existed before 5 June and at proceeding from\r\nthere with the implementation of the Addis Ababa\r\nagreement. In this respect, it is clear that involving the\r\nfactions as well as representatives of the various sectors of\r\nSomali society in the processes is vital.\r\nUNOSOM is the last chance Somalia has. Therefore,\r\nit must not be allowed to fail. Its preoccupation with the 5\r\nJune incident should not be allowed to divert its attention\r\nfrom its ultimate goal of political reconciliation and\r\neconomic and social rehabilitation. It must be recognized\r\nthat, for the objectives of UNOSOM to be achieved, the\r\nbattle for the hearts and minds of all Somalis must be won.\r\nMy delegation believes that all UNOSOM troops should be\r\nmaterially and spiritually equipped to fight and win such a\r\nwar, and that whenever there are shortcomings in that regard\r\nUNOSOM should be prepared to act promptly to redress\r\nthem. Ethiopia is ready to contribute its share to such a\r\nscenario. It will be recalled, in this regard, that the\r\nOrganization of African Unity at its summit meeting in\r\nCairo in June of this year gave a mandate to President Meles\r\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nZenawi of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia to follow\r\nup and assist in the resolution of the Somali crisis. This\r\nmandate was endorsed by the fourth summit of the Heads of\r\nState and Government of the Inter-Governmental Authority\r\non Drought and Development (IGADD).\r\nI would like to quote from the Declaration adopted by\r\nthe fourth summit of IGADD, held in Addis Ababa on 6 and\r\n7 September 1993.\r\n\"We applaud the positive achievements of the\r\nUnited Nations in Somalia in preventing the death of\r\nthousands of Somalis through starvation and conflict;\r\n\"We reinforce the conviction that caution is\r\nrequired in handling the current very complicated\r\npolitical situation in Somalia;\r\n\"We further call for a meaningful consultation\r\nbetween UNOSOM and the countries of the subregion\r\nand reiterate the need for a more active role on the part\r\nof the countries of the subregion;\r\n\"We fully endorse the mandate given to President\r\nMeles Zenawi to follow developments in Somalia on\r\nbehalf of the OAU by also mandating him to follow up\r\nthe developments in that member State on behalf of the\r\ncountries of the subregion.\"\r\nWhile the implementation of the Addis Ababa\r\nagreement is, in our considered view, the only viable avenue\r\ntowards a political solution to the Somali crisis, we also\r\nregard UNOSOM as a guarantor against a slide into anarchy\r\nin Somalia. We urge UNOSOM to continue with its task\r\nuntil the objectives of the Addis Ababa agreement are fully\r\nachieved.\r\nThe problem of refugees and persons displaced by a\r\nhost of calamities continues to haunt the Horn of Africa\r\nsubregion. In this regard, Ethiopia continues to face\r\nimmense difficulties, the solutions of which are beyond what\r\nits meagre resources and capacities allow. On top of this,\r\nEthiopia has to cope with the requirements of settling close\r\nto 1 million returnees.\r\nIt is to be recalled that agreement on principles for the\r\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance was reached with the\r\ndonors at the Horn of Africa Conference held in Addis\r\nAbaba in April 1992. Those principles should be observed\r\nto ensure that relief assistance reaches the needy.\r\nHuman life is precious. Denying people the right to\r\nsurvival, therefore, is a crime. Those who hamper the\r\ndelivery of relief aid to the needy are criminals. Likewise,\r\nthose who hold human survival hostage to their political\r\nagendas cannot and must not be regarded as anything but\r\ncriminals.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIt may be possible to put pressure on the recipients with\r\na view to adjusting their positions in ways that would\r\nfacilitate the delivery of relief aid. But the thought of\r\napplying pressure on the donors is, to say the least,\r\nnightmarish. I would like to stress that humanitarian work\r\nshould be absolutely depoliticized.\r\nWith respect to other issues of concern to the\r\ninternational community, I would like to refer to the\r\npromising developments in South Africa. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the decision on the establishment of a Transitional\r\nExecutive Council responsible for supervising the process of\r\ntransition towards a non-racial, democratic South Africa.\r\nWe commend and support all the political leaders for their\r\nbold actions in paving the way for a peaceful transition to\r\ndemocracy in South Africa.\r\nRegrettably, however, there are areas of grave concern\r\nwhere peace has yet to materialize. In this regard, the\r\nresumption of hostilities in Angola is a blow to the\r\nstupendous efforts made by the international community and\r\nby Angolans themselves to restore peace in that country.\r\nWe appeal to the parties concerned to resolve their\r\ndifferences at the negotiating table, taking into account the\r\nelections, which have been declared free and fair by\r\ninternational observers, as a reference for a political\r\nsettlement of the Angolan conflict.\r\nOn other areas of conflict in Africa, Ethiopia appeals to\r\nits brothers in Rwanda, Mozambique and Liberia to continue\r\nthe momentum towards the establishment of peace in their\r\nrespective countries. Likewise, it is Ethiopia’s fervent hope\r\nthat our brothers in the Sudan will soon discover the happy\r\nmedium that brings peace and tranquility.\r\nOn the Middle East, Ethiopia welcomes the first step\r\ntowards a settlement embodied in the historic agreement\r\nsigned in Washington by Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO). We warmly congratulate the leaders of\r\nboth sides on their courageous move, and hope that the\r\nmomentum towards a comprehensive settlement of the\r\nMiddle East conflict will pick up speed as a result.\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 35\r\nHowever, it appears that our hopes in some areas of the\r\nworld are destined to be tempered by virtual despair in\r\nothers. I am referring here to the tragic situation in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina and the senseless killing that seems to have\r\nno end. I call it senseless not with the intent of passing\r\njudgement on the legitimacy of the respective positions of\r\nthe parties to the conflict, but rather to underline the\r\nuniversal belief that the dividends of peace are so much\r\ngreater than the gains of an enormously destructive war. In\r\nfull recognition of the fact that an end to the war in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina is in the hands of the combatants\r\nthemselves, we appeal to them to cooperate with\r\ninternational mediation efforts.\r\nHumanity wants peace. Thus, humanity is looking to\r\nthe United Nations and hopes that this Organization’s\r\nresources and fortitude will make the desired impact through\r\npreventive diplomacy, conflict management and conflict\r\nresolution. At the regional level, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, at its twenty-ninth summit, held in Cairo last\r\nJune, decided to establish a mechanism for the prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts. Ethiopia is\r\ncommitted to work vigorously for its effective\r\nimplementation and for its success.\r\nAlthough we are far from being satisfied, the newly\r\nemerging international situation indicates some encouraging\r\nprospects in the area of political relationships. In the field\r\nof international economic relations, however, the situation is\r\nfar from encouraging. Our world still faces the\r\nuncomfortable reality of its division into two blocs: the\r\naffluent and the poor, the North and the South. Poverty still\r\nrepresents the greatest threat to democratic governance and\r\nworld peace and security. Political instability, corruption,\r\nhunger, illicit drug trafficking and a litany of other evils\r\ntrace their roots to mass poverty. And the international\r\ncommunity is not unaware of the factors that have conspired\r\nto frustrate the hopes and aspirations of poor countries.\r\nPromises of special programmes for the least developed\r\ncountries, 10-year action programmes and so forth agreed\r\nupon by the international community have so far made little\r\ndifference by way of alleviating poverty. In Africa, overall\r\neconomic growth continues to lag behind population growth.\r\nAnd the continent remains the poorest of all. Since there\r\ncan be no stability or better prospects for the world without\r\nreducing the disparities in levels of global development, both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries should conduct a\r\nconstructive dialogue on practical measures for stimulating\r\ndevelopment.\r\nEnvironment and development are the two major\r\nconcerns to which the international community has turned its\r\nattention. In particular, Ethiopia appreciates the international\r\ncommunity’s support for the effort to combat desertification\r\nand drought, which are causing extensive environmental\r\ndegradation in Africa. We appeal to all Member States to\r\nsupport fully the efforts of the intergovernmental negotiating\r\ncommittee for the elaboration of an international convention\r\nto combat desertification. Environmental degradation is a\r\nmajor development bottleneck which must be addressed as\r\na matter of urgency.\r\nThis occasion provides me an opportunity to share with\r\nthis Assembly a few thoughts on the situation prevailing in\r\nEthiopia since the establishment of the transitional\r\nGovernment two years ago. The process of democratization\r\nand self-rule has been consolidated through local and\r\nregional elections. The policy on equitable power-sharing\r\namong the various regions and nationalities has succeeded in\r\nensuring peace and stability throughout the country. These,\r\ncoupled with the implementation of liberalized economic\r\nreforms, reconstruction programmes and improved weather\r\nconditions, have brought about encouraging improvements in\r\nthe economy. The supportive role of international financial\r\ninstitutions and the donor community have had a useful\r\nimpact on the positive outcome of Ethiopia’s reconstruction\r\nand recovery efforts. Therefore, in a brief period of two\r\nyears, Ethiopia has emerged from a state of despair to one\r\nof recovery. We are now looking to the future with\r\nconsiderable confidence.\r\nWith respect to political programmes, Ethiopia has\r\nlaunched the final phase of the transition period with work\r\non drafting a constitution. When the constitution is\r\napproved, multi-party elections are planned, on the basis of\r\nwhich permanent State structures will be put in place.\r\nAlready, an independent judiciary is functioning, and\r\nlegality is assuming a prominent role in guaranteeing the\r\nhuman rights of the people. Peaceful political activity, a\r\nfree press and freedom of expression and of conscience are\r\nestablished features of Ethiopian life today. Our democratic\r\nattitude is working. It is working in consolidating peace and\r\nstability and in generating investor and business confidence.\r\nIt has worked in restoring the confidence of the people in\r\ntheir own future.\r\nEthiopia is committed to the observance of all aspects\r\nof the protection of human rights. Protection of the dignity\r\nof man also means freedom from poverty. \"Prisoner of\r\nconscience\" and \"prisoner of poverty\" are one and the same.\r\nThe right to freedom of expression and the right to education\r\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nare indivisible. Concern for human rights is virtually\r\nmeaningless without corresponding action on the alleviation\r\nof poverty, ignorance and other causes of deprivation.\r\nEthiopia therefore appeals to the international community to\r\ncooperate in addressing the issue of human rights in the\r\ncontext of these general principles.\r\nOur democratic outlook with respect to our relations\r\nwith neighbouring countries and peoples has borne fruit.\r\nEthiopia has never enjoyed such harmony, both internally\r\nand in its relations with its neighbours.\r\nEthiopia has attained the requisite self-confidence that\r\nmakes it a true partner in the community of nations. I wish\r\ntherefore to reiterate the continued faith of my country in the\r\ncollective wisdom of our global Organization and to pledge\r\nanew our unreserved support for the laudable efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations system. We believe that as the guarantor of\r\ninternational peace and stability, the United Nations should\r\nexpand its efforts by stepping up its activities in the field of\r\npreventive diplomacy. It should develop new, more\r\neffective machinery to coordinate actions aimed at enhancing\r\nrespect for the norms of international law and ensuring the\r\nsecurity and interests of all States.\r\nAlongside the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, we welcome United Nations efforts in assisting the\r\ndeveloping countries in their endeavour to achieve a greater\r\ndegree of economic development and self-reliance. The role\r\nof the United Nations in world affairs is all-inclusive. For\r\nthis role to be effective, it is important that the\r\nOrganization’s methods of operation be characterized by\r\naccountability and transparency. Ethiopia subscribes to the\r\ncalls for democratizing the decision-making processes of the\r\nUnited Nations system and for streamlining its bureaucracy.\r\nI am hopeful that at this session the General Assembly will\r\nreview and assess these priority issues with a view to\r\nrevitalizing the Organization so that it can meet the\r\nimperatives of the time.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: A number of representatives have\r\nrequested to speak in exercise of the right of reply, and I\r\nshall call upon them now.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second, and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. MCLEAN (United States of America): The United\r\nStates notes with sadness the tone of the remarks delivered\r\nearlier today by the Foreign Minister of Cuba, particularly\r\nthe disparaging approach to the efforts, hopes and\r\naccomplishments of this institution. Cuba is indeed a\r\ntroubled land whose people continue to pay a heavy price for\r\ntheir Government’s failed economic management and\r\nideological rigidity. To shirk blame, the Cuban Government\r\nseeks refuge in misstatements, such as the totally false\r\nassertion that the United States prevents Cuba from\r\npurchasing medicine.\r\nBut these and other ludicrous claims do nothing to\r\nmitigate the suffering the Cuban Government has inflicted\r\non its people. Rather, they call the world’s attention to the\r\nincreasing desperation of those who swim frenetically\r\nagainst the currents of political freedom, economic\r\nopportunity and human rights.\r\nMr. NAIMI ARFA (Islamic Republic of Iran): This\r\nmorning the Assembly heard a statement by the Foreign\r\nMinister of the United Arab Emirates. I regret that I have\r\nto reply, and I do so only to set the record straight.\r\nMy country has endeavoured in earnest over the past\r\nseveral years to work out arrangements, in consultation and\r\ncooperation with the countries of the Persian Gulf region, to\r\nfoster and consolidate security and solidity. We have\r\naffirmed, officially and on numerous occasions, the need to\r\nestablish regional security and cooperation arrangements in\r\nthe Persian Gulf based on the commitment of every State to\r\nthe following principles: respect for sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity; the unacceptability of claims on the\r\nterritories of others; the inviolability of international borders;\r\nnon-resort to force in the settlement of disputes; non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States; respect for\r\nand compliance with existing agreements and\r\nunderstandings; and dialogue and mutual understanding.\r\nMembers are fully aware that this morning my Minister\r\nexpounded on this matter in his statement before the\r\nAssembly. In fact, he had presented a detailed plan to that\r\neffect to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session,\r\nthree years ago. Ever since, we have been very keen to\r\ncontribute to the implementation of that plan.\r\nThe second aspect I would like to address, although\r\nvery briefly, concerns the crux of the matter: the differences\r\nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United Arab\r\nEmirates. Facts simply fail to corroborate the scenario\r\npresented by the Foreign Minister of the United Arab\r\nEmirates. It may not be that difficult to portray a nice,\r\nalbeit self-serving, picture but it would be very difficult\r\nindeed to make a consistent case. The sequence of events as\r\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 37\r\nthey really happened, and as things were, is quite different\r\nfrom the version of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nSince late in the summer of 1992, the Government of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran has endeavoured in earnest and\r\nwith sincerity to resolve the misunderstandings between the\r\ntwo countries that had arisen as regards Abu Musa island.\r\nTowards that end, and on the basis of the overall effort to\r\nwhich I have just referred, we entered into negotiations with\r\nthe other party. The international community is well aware\r\nof the Iranian initiative late in September 1992 of sending a\r\nhigh-level delegation to Abu Dhabi for negotiations. In all\r\nhonesty, it was our hope that the other party would\r\nreciprocate this approach and attitude. Much to our surprise,\r\nthe United Arab Emirates party raised certain preconditions\r\nfor the negotiations, which were totally unacceptable. This\r\nforced the bilateral talks to come to a halt at that stage.\r\nMoreover, ever since the end of the first round of\r\nnegotiations in Abu Dhabi, the other party, which had\r\nanticipated the resumption of talks in Tehran, failed to do so.\r\nInstead, in pursuit of objectives inconsistent with the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, they resorted to other ways\r\nand means, such as the issuance in many places of repeated\r\ncarbon-copy statements.\r\nThe approach and behaviour of the United Arab\r\nEmirates over the past year, which seems to have been\r\ncheered on by a not-so-congruent consort of well-wishes\r\nfrom within and outside the region, make it crystal clear that\r\nthey have not committed themselves to honest negotiations\r\nwith the objective of resolving problems.\r\nRather, they have tried by every means possible to keep\r\nthe pending difficulty in a state of permanent limbo, pushing\r\nthe situation periodically to centre stage in the Persian Gulf\r\nby rubber-stamp statements coming out of various Arab\r\ngatherings. It is indeed a matter of deep regret that the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates party chose to keep the\r\nmisunderstanding between the two countries alive and\r\nsimmering, a misjudgement which seems to have been\r\nprompted by expressions of support from other countries -\r\nwhich, in any case, are transient in nature.\r\nAll through this process the Government of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran has publicly, as well as through diplomatic\r\nchannels, expressed its readiness on numerous occasions to\r\nengage in and resume bilateral talks, without any\r\npreconditions, on all issues pending between the two\r\ncountries. The official visit by the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Abu Dhabi in May\r\n1993 best illustrates the Iranian attitude. In the joint\r\nstatement that was issued at the end of the two-day visit, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates and Iran expressed their desire and\r\nreadiness to engage in further talks to remove obstacles\r\nhindering discussions on issues pending between the two\r\ncountries. The statement continued:\r\n\"This has to be implemented to achieve the hoped-for\r\nimprovement in bilateral relations which will contribute\r\npositively to the security and stability of the region.\"\r\nAfter that latest Iranian initiative, the United Arab\r\nEmirates Minister was supposed to reciprocate the visit, the\r\ndetails of which were to be discussed and finalized through\r\nnormal diplomatic channels. The announcement in Abu\r\nDhabi in September 1993 of the cancellation of the\r\nforthcoming visit to Tehran was indeed a matter of surprise.\r\nJust two days prior to that announcement the Ambassador of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates in Tehran had delivered a positive\r\nmessage from his Government to the Iranian Foreign\r\nMinister in which the date of the visit had been set.\r\nWe were and continue to be fully prepared in Tehran\r\nto engage in frank and in-depth discussions with the United\r\nArab Emirates delegation of all issues pending between the\r\ntwo sides. Of course - and let me be very clear - we were\r\nprepared to enter into negotiations without any preconditions.\r\nFrom the very beginning we have found unacceptable the\r\nsetting by the United Arab Emirates of preconditions for\r\nnegotiations, and it continues to be so. It is simply illogical\r\nand contrary to normal practice in inter-State relations for\r\none party to an issue to make resumption of bilateral talks\r\ncontingent upon acceptance by the other side of its\r\nconditions.\r\nI would like to say a word about the substance of the\r\nclaim put forward by the United Arab Emirates. Without\r\nentering into any lengthy discussion of the true history of the\r\nislands in question, which is well known, I need only\r\nreiterate the legitimacy of the Iranian position with regard to\r\nits unassailable and indisputable sovereignty over the islands.\r\nAmple and solid historical evidence from antiquity to the\r\npresent time corroborates our position. The fact that Iranian\r\nsovereignty over the islands in question was interrupted\r\nbetween 1904 and 1971 as a result of colonial ploys does not\r\nby any means change the status of those islands. What\r\ntranspired in 1971 was no more than the reassertion of Iran’s\r\nsovereignty over the islands.\r\nWhile reiterating my Government’s full commitment to\r\nthe 1971 Memorandum of Understanding between Iran and\r\nSharjah on the Abu-Musa island, I would take this\r\nopportunity to underline our full-fledged adherence to the\r\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nprinciple of respect for the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of other countries in the Persian Gulf. However, I\r\nwould like to stress at the same time that it is incumbent\r\nupon all States to respect this principle. Moreover, allusion\r\nto subjective, self-serving and baseless historical claims over\r\nthe territory of other States is, as the recent Persian Gulf\r\ncrisis best illustrates, nothing but a dangerous political\r\nminefield with catastrophic consequences, a true Pandora’s\r\nbox that the international community would rather have not\r\nopened.\r\nHaving said that, on behalf of my delegation I would\r\nlike to reaffirm once again my Government’s principled\r\napproach to our relations with the United Arab Emirates\r\nwithin the general framework of our policy towards the\r\nstrategic Persian Gulf region, and to reconfirm our\r\nwillingness and readiness to continue bilateral negotiations\r\nfor the mutually beneficial resolution of issues pending\r\nbetween the two countries. For us in Iran, the imperative of\r\nthe maintenance of security and tranquillity in the area is of\r\nparamount importance. We hope that our brothers in Abu\r\nDhabi will reciprocate this spirit of good-neighbourly and\r\nbrotherly relations, thus denying any opportunity to\r\nextraneous elements from within and outside the region to\r\nfan the flames on behalf of interests that are not those of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates, Iran and the Persian Gulf.\r\nMr. SAMHAN (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): The Iranian delegate has referred in his\r\nstatement to the existing dispute between the United Arab\r\nEmirates and Iran over the three islands which belong to my\r\ncountry, namely Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa.\r\nOn behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates and\r\nin reply to the statement just made by the representative of\r\nIran, I should like to emphasize the fact that my country\r\nrejects Iran’s military occupation of the three islands that it\r\nhas done so since the beginning of 1971, and has condemned\r\nthe measures taken by Iran which have resulted in the killing\r\nof many of the inhabitants of those islands who were\r\nnationals of the United Arab Emirates and who had\r\nremained on the Islands. We have already declared this\r\nposition in the General Assembly, in the Security Council\r\nand in other United Nations bodies, as well as in other\r\nregional organs. We still consider the Iranian presence on\r\nthe three islands merely as a military, unlawful occupation\r\nthat contravenes the Charter of the United Nations, the rules\r\nof international law and the norms of good-neighbourliness.\r\nWe have tried to settle the dispute by peaceful means\r\nthrough contacts between the two countries, but the Iranian\r\nside has persisted in its stance which rejects our claims. In\r\nparticular it has refused any form of consideration of its\r\nmilitary occupation of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu\r\nMusa and has insisted on dealing with secondary questions\r\nthat have nothing to do with the substance of the matter.\r\nOver the past two years, it has escalated the conflict by\r\nresorting to a number of unlawful measures and practices\r\nincluding the use of military force, against the nationals of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates on the island of Abu Musa, in\r\nviolation of the Memorandum of Understanding of 1971.\r\nDespite all that, my country wishes to declare once\r\nagain its complete willingness to settle this dispute by any\r\npeaceful means stipulated by the Charter, so as to regain its\r\nsovereignty over the three islands, which are an integral part\r\nof our territory. This stance by the United Arab Emirates\r\nstems from its conviction that stability and security in the\r\nGulf region necessitate cooperation and mutual respect for\r\nsovereignty by the countries of the region, non-interference\r\nin the internal affairs of others and the need to settle\r\ndisputes by peaceful means, especially in the light of the\r\nnew international and regional circumstances. Therefore, we\r\nappeal once again to the Islamic Republic of Iran to give a\r\nfavourable reply to our call.\r\nMr. IBANEZ FAJARDO (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It cannot be claimed that any atmosphere of\r\ncordiality exists when criminal policies continue to be\r\ncarried out in an attempt to starve my small country to\r\ndeath, solely because we have a dream of independence to\r\nwhich we hold fast and a plan for social justice that fits our\r\nown conditions. The powerful State to the North cannot\r\ndictate formulas to the Cuban people. Our history has taught\r\nus the lack of respect for our ideals shown by this gigantic\r\nneighbour, with its colonial yearnings and its tendentious\r\nmanipulation of the media. Cuba is doing nothing more than\r\ndemonstrating its willingness to have peaceful coexistence\r\nand international cooperation, and we only ask for respect\r\nfor our struggles and for our dignity and patriotism.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.55 p.m.\r\n"
