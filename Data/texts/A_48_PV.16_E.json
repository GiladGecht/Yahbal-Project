"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n16th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nTuesday, 5 October 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.35 a.m.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. GLAFCOS CLERIDES,\r\nPRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Cyprus, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Glafcos Clerides, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident CLERIDES: Mr. President, it is with great\r\npleasure that I congratulate you on your election as President\r\nof the General Assembly. This is not merely a recognition\r\nof your long experience and your outstanding ability and\r\ndiplomatic skill, but also a reflection of the esteem in which\r\nyour country, Guyana, is held in the United Nations. We are\r\ncertain that, under your able guidance, the work of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly will be a landmark in the\r\nnew international scene and in facing the new challenges for\r\npeace, democracy and progress.\r\nI should like also to pay a warm tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for the determined leadership that he has\r\ndemonstrated on vital international issues and for his\r\nexcellent report on the work of the Organization, which\r\nprovides much food for thought and indicates various areas\r\nof important activities that are the object of soul-searching\r\nconsideration in this debate.\r\nMay I remind Members that, from the beginning of its\r\nexistence as an independent State after many years of\r\ncolonial rule until its admission to the United Nations in\r\n1960, Cyprus has consciously made the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter central to its foreign policy, and,\r\nwithin its limited possibilities, has endeavoured in every\r\npossible way to be supportive of the Organization.\r\nFrankly, I have to admit that we followed this approach\r\nin our foreign policy both as a matter of principle and as a\r\nmatter of self-interest. We have always believed that the\r\nUnited Nations was mankind’s best hope for a system of\r\ninternational order, despite the fact that we were aware of\r\nthe possibilities of non-adherence to it and of the limitations\r\nto the effectiveness of the world Organization resulting from\r\nthe existence of military blocs. Our self-interest as a small\r\nand militarily weak country made us feel the need for the\r\nprotection of the world Organization, and, as a developing\r\ncountry, we stood to benefit from multilateral technical\r\nassistance and know-how.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s excellent report testifies to the\r\nfact that, in today’s post-cold-war era, the United Nations is\r\nat a crossroads. Some years ago, in the context of the\r\nEast-West divide and the continuing build-up of nuclear\r\narsenals, we were agonizing in international forums over the\r\nfuture of our civilization. The cold war is finally over,\r\nopening up new prospects for positive change in\r\ninternational policies. New prospects are also opening up\r\nfor concerted action and a global approach to the problems\r\nwe face.\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86746 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.16\r\n21 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn some parts of the world, the old regimes have\r\ncollapsed and a move to pluralistic societies and the free\r\nmarket economy is being made. However, the newly\r\nacquired freedom has revived old enmities. This is not a\r\nstrange phenomenon because, as the eminent, late Prime\r\nMinister of India, Mr. Nehru, said, the walk to freedom is\r\nnot an easy one. World developments indicate, and clearly\r\ndemonstrate, that unless the international community adopts\r\na more unified approach in its understanding of the\r\nchallenges it faces and promotes the necessary solutions,\r\nhuman rights abuses, increasing insecurity and hunger and\r\nsuffering will create an explosive situation that will spare no\r\none; we are, though, gradually becoming aware of the\r\ncomplexity and scope that even minor issues acquire in an\r\ninterdependent world.\r\nThe world is full of challenges and opportunities. Our\r\ncommon responsibility is to strengthen the world\r\nOrganization in order best to respond to these challenges and\r\nincrease mankind’s expectations of peace, prosperity and\r\ndemocracy. These expectations can be met only by making\r\nthe United Nations more effective, through the\r\nimplementation of its own resolutions and the mandatory\r\nprovisions of the Charter.\r\nThe General Assembly, based on the principle of\r\nsovereign equality, has much to offer and must continue to\r\nplay its important role under the Charter.\r\nNowadays, however, the Security Council has a\r\nsubstantially enlarged agenda. As the Charter envisages, it\r\nis able to decide and act. At present it is able to act in a\r\nmore effective manner in the crucial areas of international\r\npeace and security. It is evident that the Security Council\r\ncan now play a much more important role than ever before.\r\nThis is a welcome development, and within the context of\r\nthis expanded role a review of its membership to reflect the\r\nrealities of today’s world is highly appropriate.\r\nHowever, the effectiveness of the Security Council, the\r\nhighest organ of the United Nations, can be achieved only if\r\nit applies the practice of acting with determination.\r\nExperience has demonstrated that in those cases where the\r\ninternational community has shown determination to uphold\r\nthe principles of international instruments and fully apply\r\ntheir provisions, progress can be made. In those cases where\r\nunity of purpose has not been shown or interests of nations\r\nhave been placed above universal principles and rule of law,\r\nthe problems remain, and peace is elusive.\r\nI wish to point out with emphasis that gaps in\r\ninternational law and practice - failure to uphold\r\ninternational law and human rights, or upholding them in\r\none situation and closing our eyes to their violation in others\r\n- must no longer be acceptable behaviour, particularly in the\r\nnew world order to which we all aspire.\r\nIn today’s world, where economics plays an\r\nincreasingly important role, the United Nations, through the\r\nSecretariat, the United Nations Development Programme and\r\nthe various specialized agencies, carries out multi-purpose\r\nactivities for the betterment and economic well-being of\r\npeople throughout the world. These activities are outlined\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report, and in the interest of\r\nsaving time I do not intend to comment on them other than\r\nto declare that we fully recognize their importance and\r\nsupport them. We look forward to receiving later in this\r\nsession the Secretary-General’s integrated approach to\r\ndevelopment issues in his forthcoming agenda for\r\ndevelopment, which will no doubt appropriately complement\r\nhis groundbreaking \"An Agenda for Peace\" in matters of\r\npeace and security.\r\nIn the light of our overall philosophy, as I indicated\r\nearlier, we attach much importance to the effective\r\nfunctioning of the principal judicial organ of the United\r\nNations, the International Court of Justice. The increase of\r\nits jurisdiction in contentious cases is encouraging, and we\r\nalso attach importance to the possibility of clarifying legal\r\npoints in political disputes through advisory opinions. The\r\nInternational Court of Justice is indeed an integral part of\r\nUnited Nations peace efforts and we support the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal that he be authorized to seek\r\nadvisory opinions from the Court as an important component\r\nof the United Nations peacemaking apparatus as a whole.\r\nThe Secretariat’s role in an improved and more\r\neffective United Nations is indisputable, and we pay tribute\r\nto the many men and women in the international civil\r\nservice whose competence and dedication enable the\r\nOrganization to respond to the ever-increasing demands\r\nmade of it in today’s world conditions. The\r\nSecretary-General has already done much in the direction of\r\nrationalizing and streamlining the Secretariat, as well as in\r\nputting in place effective machinery for inspections and\r\ninvestigations whenever necessary, and he certainly has our\r\nsupport in the additional measures needed to carry out this\r\nHerculean task. We join in recognizing the undoubted need\r\nfor an adequate financial basis for the Organization and for\r\nassessed contributions to be paid early and in full by\r\nMember States, in terms of both the regular budget and the\r\ncosts of peace-keeping. Voluntary contributions are also to\r\nbe encouraged in order to carry out the tasks at hand, and I\r\nmight recall that Cyprus, besides endeavouring to play its\r\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 3\r\nmodest role in as many such cases as its means allow, has\r\nalso undertaken to make, on a continuous basis, a major\r\ncontribution towards the financing of the United Nations\r\nPeace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).\r\nPast and recent experience in every region of the world\r\nhas demonstrated that the protection and promotion of\r\nhuman rights is an indispensable ingredient of a stable world\r\norder. Over the years the United Nations has played its full\r\npart in affirming human equality, which is, indeed, the heart\r\nof all rights, and in building bridges across the divides of\r\nrace, ethnicity, culture, socio-economic disparities and\r\npolitical philosophies. Democracy and human rights are two\r\nof the United Nations Charter’s most cherished principles,\r\nand they have always figured prominently in United Nations\r\nconferences.\r\nDemocracy is the only system of government that can\r\nsafeguard the liberty of the people, respect for human rights\r\nand quality of life. We have a duty to remain vigilant and\r\ncontinue to look for ways in which these new opportunities\r\npresented by world developments may be used for the\r\npromotion of international peace, the advancement of the\r\nrule of law and the protection of human rights.\r\nThe world community must clearly oppose chauvinistic\r\nnationalism, take a clear-cut stand against policies of \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\" and unequivocally continue making all efforts\r\nuntil we achieve the complete dismantlement of the unjust\r\nand inhumane social systems based on ethnic political\r\nsegregation and the development and consolidation of a\r\nnon-racial, democratic South Africa.\r\nThe effective promotion of human rights cannot be\r\nseparated from the global trend towards democratization.\r\nCyprus is in the forefront of States that have become party\r\nto treaties for the protection of human rights, both at the\r\nglobal level, within the United Nations, and at the regional\r\nlevel, primarily through the Council of Europe. We are\r\nespecially sensitive on this subject, since one large\r\ncomponent of the Cyprus problem in its present dimensions\r\nis the massive violation of the human rights of the displaced\r\npersons who have been evicted by force from their homes by\r\nthe Turkish forces of occupation. Their homes and\r\nproperties have been usurped by illegal settlers imported\r\nfrom Turkey to Cyprus in an effort by the aggressor to\r\nchange the demographic composition of the population of\r\nCyprus.\r\nAll these flagrant violations of human rights have been\r\ncommitted by Turkey, a Member of the United Nations,\r\ndespite General Assembly and Security Council resolutions\r\ncalling on all United Nations Members to respect the\r\nindependence and territorial integrity of the Republic, avoid\r\nany actions which could change the demographic\r\ncomposition of the population of Cyprus, withdraw all\r\nforeign forces from the territory of the Republic and allow\r\nthe return of the refugees to their homes under conditions of\r\nsafety.\r\nCyprus is a case in point of the complete defiance of\r\nGeneral Assembly and Security Council resolutions by one\r\nof its members. In reality, the intransigence of the Turkish\r\nside, which has rendered every effort to find a solution\r\nimpossible, accounts for the hesitation of the Security\r\nCouncil to adopt measures for compliance with its\r\nresolutions. If a viable and lasting solution of the Cyprus\r\nproblem is to be arrived at without further delay and a\r\nfederally united State is to be established without occupation\r\ntroops and settlers, concerted action is required by the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nIt is not only in the solution of the Cyprus problem that\r\nTurkey shows intransigence. The Turkish intransigence\r\nextends to purely humanitarian issues, such as cooperation\r\nin ascertaining the fate of missing persons and in\r\nimplementing the third Vienna agreement regarding persons\r\nenclaved in occupied areas.\r\nI wish to express appreciation for the support extended\r\nto Cyprus by the General Assembly, the Secretary-General\r\nand the Security Council. We consider a good omen of\r\nfurther determined action the declaration of the\r\nSecretary-General in his most recent report to the Security\r\nCouncil on Cyprus, and the Council’s positive response to it,\r\nthat unless progress is made on the Cyprus problem he will\r\nrequest the Security Council to consider alternative ways of\r\nsecuring compliance with the many resolutions of the United\r\nNations on Cyprus.\r\nWe have had occasion in the past to express our\r\nsupport for the constructive suggestions of the\r\nSecretary-General for improving the potential of United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations in today’s increasing\r\ndemand for them, including the training of personnel, the\r\nstrengthening of the Department of Peace-keeping\r\nOperations and the earmarking of appropriate equipment and\r\npersonnel for use by the United Nations. We are encouraged\r\nthat progress has been made in all these areas and in the\r\nsetting up of a peace-keeping Reserve Fund, but, in view of\r\nthe ever-increasing demands and the worsening of financial\r\nproblems associated with these operations, complacency is\r\nnot justified and we should all continue to do our best to\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nassist in discharging this major responsibility thrust on our\r\nOrganization.\r\nWith regard to peace-keeping, it has been said - not\r\nwithout justification - that the United Nations should avoid\r\nopen-ended involvement in peace-keeping operations.\r\nCyprus has been pointed out as an example of over-long\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping involvement. The broader\r\nlesson to be drawn from the experience of United Nations\r\ninvolvement in peace-keeping and peacemaking in Cyprus is\r\nthat, so long as one of the parties concerned is not willing to\r\ncomply with the dictates of the international community as\r\nspelt out in unanimously adopted and binding resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council; and so long as the members of the\r\ninternational community, and more particularly the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, are not willing\r\nor able to act effectively in order to implement resolutions\r\nfor which they voted, peacemaking will lag behind peace-\r\nkeeping, resulting in the indefinite perpetuation of the\r\nproblem and of the peace-keeping operation concerned. This\r\nis, obviously, an unsatisfactory situation - unsatisfactory to\r\nthe Government and the country directly concerned;\r\nunsatisfactory to the countries contributing to the cost of the\r\npeace-keeping operation; and of course, unsatisfactory to the\r\nUnited Nations. I submit that the answer lies not in\r\nabandoning the peace-keeping effort and thereby abdicating\r\nresponsibility, leaving the weak at the mercy of the strong\r\nand striking a blow against longstanding efforts to solve the\r\nproblem, but in pressing on with effective peacemaking\r\nthrough the implementation of the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions by all available means, so as to reach a solution\r\nconsistent with the Charter and the United Nations\r\nresolutions. Cyprus is indeed a test-case, not, however, with\r\nregard to peace-keeping, but with regard to the effectiveness\r\nof the United Nations in peacemaking.\r\nIf I set out at some length our views on \"An Agenda\r\nfor Peace\", I did so not only because it is very important,\r\nbut also because Cyprus is itself a case-study of most of the\r\nproblems it raises. I shall refrain from commenting on the\r\nlong litany listed in this year’s report of international\r\nproblems in which the Organization is actively engaged and\r\nwhich extend to all five continents. Each presents its own\r\ncomplications and special characteristics. They provide a\r\nmeasure of the enormous expectations placed upon the\r\nUnited Nations, the awesome burden of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s responsibilities, and the respect and admiration he\r\ndeserves in carrying out these responsibilities. As he rightly\r\npoints out:\r\n\"The United Nations, by undertaking a range of\r\nproblems as wide as the globe itself, must be expected\r\nto achieve successes but also to experience failure.\"\r\n(A/48/1, para. 512)\r\nWhile in the past few years the world has witnessed the\r\ncreation of new areas of tension and conflict through the\r\nunleashing of destructive and centrifugal forces of excessive\r\nnationalism and ethnic strife, there have also been some\r\nnotable successes through the solution of several regional\r\nissues and the withdrawal of foreign forces following the\r\nend of cold-war antagonism. We have witnessed in many\r\nparts of the world the triumph of democracy and the\r\nemergence of free-market economies. More concretely,\r\nthere has been the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the\r\nhistoric reunification of Germany; major progress towards\r\nending the odious practice of apartheid in South Africa has\r\nbeen achieved; and, as recently as last month, the historic\r\naccord between Israel and the PLO was signed at the White\r\nHouse, marking a new era in the Middle East. All three\r\nsituations had appeared to present the insurmountable\r\nproblems of unending and seemingly irreconcilable conflicts.\r\nAnd yet, with vision and imagination, the political will for\r\nsolutions was found.\r\nIn contrast, the problem with which my own country\r\nhas been confronted for too long has remained intractable,\r\ndespite the existence of unanimously adopted United Nations\r\nresolutions and despite the mutually acceptable procedure of\r\nthe good offices of the United Nations Secretary-General.\r\nIn our view, the problem is solvable and must be solved, yet\r\nthe efforts of many years have come to no result owing to\r\nTurkish intransigence backed by Turkish military might.\r\nWe remain committed to reaching a peaceful solution\r\non the basis of the United Nations resolutions and the high-\r\nlevel agreements. As clearly emerges from successive\r\nreports of the Secretary-General, we have cooperated with\r\nhim in all sincerity in the exercise of his good offices for an\r\noverall solution, and we have responded positively to his\r\nproposals for the adoption, as a first step, of the confidence-\r\nbuilding measures and in particular the placing of Famagusta\r\nand the opening of the Nicosia airport under United Nations\r\nadministration.\r\nIn 1945, the founding fathers signed the Charter in San\r\nFrancisco, in the aftermath of a devastating war, with the\r\nvision of establishing the foundations of a better and more\r\npeaceful world. As it nears its fiftieth anniversary, a\r\nwatershed in its history, the United Nations is again facing\r\na major challenge in a rapidly changing international climate.\r\nPeoples and nations all over the world place growing\r\nexpectations in the Organization’s response to the new\r\nsummons for a universal alliance for peace and justice, for\r\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 5\r\ndemocracy, development and international legal order. At\r\nthe same time, the ominous phenomena of ethnic strife,\r\ndestructive nationalism, widespread poverty and social\r\ninjustice are undermining the vital role of the United Nations\r\nin opposing aggression and maintaining international peace,\r\nand are thus posing new challenges.\r\nAs the Organization is restructuring itself in order to\r\nmeet these challenges more effectively, it is clear that, by\r\nand large, the Charter has stood the test of time. As we\r\napproach the milestone of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization, let us agree to spare no effort to make it more\r\neffective, and let us look upon the Charter not merely as a\r\ncode of international behaviour that is difficult to live up to\r\nand comply with, but as a reasonable and practical model for\r\neveryday international behaviour and political ethics.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of Cyprus, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. ZHELYU ZHELEV, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Bulgaria.\r\nMr. Zhelyu Zhelev, President of the Republic of\r\nBulgaria, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Zhelyu Zhelev, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident ZHELEV (spoke in Bulgarian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): I would first of all like to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to this\r\nresponsible post, and to wish you success.\r\nOn behalf of the Republic of Bulgaria, let me\r\ncongratulate the delegations of the States that have joined the\r\nUnited Nations as new Members this year - the Czech\r\nRepublic, the Slovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Eritrea, Monaco and Andorra.\r\nThree years ago, in this same Hall, I had the honour of\r\naddressing the world forum. My message was on behalf of\r\ndemocratic Bulgaria, a country where changes fully and\r\ngenuinely match the ideals and values uniting the nations in\r\nthe world Organization. Since then, as indeed over the past\r\nyear, under the Bulgarian presidency of the General\r\nAssembly, we have witnessed diverse and often contradicting\r\ntrends in international life. If there is a dominating feeling,\r\nthough, it is one of optimism and of trust, on the part of\r\nboth Governments and nations, in the United Nations as a\r\nspokesman for and guarantor of the political will of the\r\nworld community for peace and sustainable democratic\r\ndevelopment. We have seen a number of encouraging\r\nexamples of this.\r\nThe democratic changes in Eastern Europe have added\r\nan element of dynamism to building European unity and the\r\nEuropean civil society, a society open to the rest of the\r\nworld. Important forums of the European Community, the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the\r\nCouncil of Europe provide a frame and a foundation for the\r\nemerging European unity and security. Bulgaria has been an\r\nactive participant in the European organizations. It will be\r\nthe first post-Communist country to assume the presidency\r\nof the Committee of Ministers of the oldest European\r\norganization - the Council of Europe. It is also a\r\ncoordinator of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Group,\r\nbringing together the countries of that region.\r\nAfter the Berlin wall, the walls of Jericho came\r\ntumbling down. There began the long-expected unraveling\r\nof the Gordian knot in the Middle East, the place where\r\nthree world cultural and religious traditions coexist. We\r\nwelcome also the development of democratic processes in\r\nSouth Africa that will lead to the establishment of a united\r\nand non-racial society.\r\nHumanity has bid farewell to chemical weapons; and it\r\nhas succeeded in convening world conferences on subjects\r\nbelieved until recently to defy consensus, such as human\r\nrights and protection for the victims of war.\r\nThe democratic changes in Eastern Europe and the\r\nformer Soviet Union continue to be an important condition\r\nfor the positive changes in international life at the turn of\r\nthis century. The heightened attention of the world\r\ncommunity to the social and political tensions in Moscow is\r\nas understandable as is the broad international support for\r\nthe reform-minded and democratic forces in Russia, support\r\nwith which Bulgaria fully agrees. The dramatic events in\r\nMoscow which we witnessed over the weekend prove how\r\ndifficult and painful the transition from post-Communist\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsociety to democracy and a market economy is, and what\r\ndangers and risks it entails. The United Nations cannot\r\nsimply stand by and watch with indifference the difficulties\r\nof the countries in transition. If we are to live up to the\r\nname \"United Nations\" we have to render our moral,\r\npolitical and financial support to these nations.\r\nThe collapse of totalitarian rule, and the breakup of the\r\nSoviet empire and of the Warsaw Treaty, created an\r\nunexpected paradox: less danger to world peace and, at the\r\nsame time, less peace in the world and more challenges and\r\ntrials for the United Nations.\r\nRegional conflicts have proved to be a key problem for\r\nthe new democracies. Think of the consequences of the\r\nworld community’s failure to handle the war in the former\r\nYugoslavia! The stakes are always high but they are even\r\nhigher in the Balkans where conflicts threaten to spill over\r\nand embroil other States.\r\nBulgaria’s civilized and good-neighbourly Balkan policy\r\nentitles it now, as indeed at the very outset of the Yugoslav\r\ncrisis, to insist on firm judgement and energetic steps on the\r\npart of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the\r\nSecretary-General to contain and end the barbaric war in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and to prevent other smouldering\r\nconflicts in former Yugoslavia from flaring up.\r\nRecent attempts to find concerted ways of coordinating\r\nthe peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations and the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have been\r\nfollowed with keen interest in Bulgaria. We have already\r\nvoiced our support for the constructive engagement of\r\nPresident Clinton’s Administration, notably the preventive\r\nstationing of a contingent of troops under a United Nations\r\nflag in Macedonia.\r\nBulgaria is against re-drawing borders and gaining\r\nterritory by force. It has been consistent in its position in\r\nfavour of a peaceful solution of the Yugoslav crisis.\r\nBy virtue of its geopolitical situation, Bulgaria has a\r\nkey role to play in implementing the economic sanctions\r\nagainst Serbia and Montenegro. We share the longest land\r\nborder with Serbia and we are not involved, either directly\r\nor indirectly, in the hostilities in former Yugoslavia.\r\nWithout Bulgaria the sanctions will be doomed to failure.\r\nFully aware of our responsibility, we adhere strictly to the\r\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council in the face of\r\ngreat economic sacrifice. Measured against our potential,\r\nthe losses are indeed huge. The embargo has closed\r\nBulgaria’s direct route to the markets of Western Europe.\r\nConsequently, its losses for 1992 were estimated - with\r\nexpert assistance from the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) - at $943.6 million. The 1993 figure is\r\nexpected to be several times higher. The effect of the\r\nsanctions may lead to halting and thwarting economic\r\nreform, as well as jeopardizing the democratic process and\r\nsocial peace in Bulgaria. In other words, the price Bulgaria\r\nis paying for peace and security in the Balkans and in\r\nEurope may prove fatal to its internal peace and stability.\r\nDirect losses from the sanctions against former Yugoslavia,\r\nIraq and Libya, are commensurate with one half of\r\nBulgaria’s external debt to commercial creditor banks, and\r\nthey dim the prospects for economic recovery, development\r\nand integration into the world community.\r\nAs a State Member of the United Nations Bulgaria\r\nfulfils its international obligations in good faith, convinced\r\nthat any civilized country concerned about world security\r\nshould uphold a common cause - even at the cost of\r\nsacrifice. Yet, is it not fair for a country in our position to\r\nseek assistance and understanding from the world\r\nOrganization and its Member States?\r\nThere is an urgent need to devise a working mechanism\r\nof awarding compensation to Member States which sustain\r\nlosses as a result of the strict implementation of the\r\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council. The provisions\r\nof Chapter VII of the Charter are equally important and\r\nshould be applied strictly. Article 50 of the Charter could be\r\nbacked up by relevant agreements for concrete aid to\r\nMember States affected by sanctions against third countries.\r\nThe forms of compensation could include, among others,\r\nmeasures to ease the economic situation of the affected\r\ncountry, such as concluding stand-by agreements with the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), facilitating the debt-\r\nservicing and settlement procedure, financing major transport\r\nand communication infrastructure projects nationally and\r\nregionally - in our case, new bridges on the River Danube,\r\nan international airport, motorways linking Bulgaria and\r\nGreece, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Albania such as\r\nThessaloniki-Vidin and Sofia-Skopje-Tirana - speeding up\r\nthe ratification of the European Association Agreement\r\nbetween Bulgaria and the European Community and an\r\nearlier accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and\r\nTrade.\r\nThe Bulgarian delegation at this session of the General\r\nAssembly will put forward proposals on some of the above\r\nissues. We rely on the support and cooperation of the States\r\nMembers of the Organization in this regard.\r\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 7\r\nConsidering that no international organization at the\r\nmoment is in a position to award direct compensation for\r\nlosses sustained as a result of economic sanctions, the\r\nindirect ways of compensation could be of crucial\r\nimportance.\r\nThe problem of international sanctions and\r\ncompensation merits serious attention. It calls for an\r\nin-depth analysis, as it vitally concerns a number of States\r\nMembers of the United Nations. The time is ripe to look\r\ninto these issues at a special forum for which Bulgaria offers\r\nits hospitality.\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations have\r\nconstituted a most significant and prominent part of the\r\nworld Organization’s work over the past year. I could not\r\nemphasize more the importance of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\", which developed the\r\nconcept of crisis management through preventive diplomacy.\r\nBulgaria supported this political strategy and backed up its\r\nwords with actions by sending Blue Helmets to Cambodia.\r\nOnce again, the international community seems to have\r\nbeen inadequately prepared for mounting such operations.\r\nThe question of the safety of United Nations personnel\r\nproved particularly poignant. Bulgaria lost 10 volunteers in\r\nCambodia, not to mention the cost of its involvement, which\r\nhas not yet been fully estimated.\r\nEarly warning for potential conflicts calls for effective\r\ninternational mechanisms to monitor the human rights\r\nsituation, including that of individuals from minority groups\r\n- because conflicts brew wherever individual human rights\r\nare trampled upon, wherever the universal values of modern\r\ncivilization are replaced by survival instincts and political\r\npluralism and the diversity of ideas, by intolerance,\r\nxenophobia, racism, religious and political bigotry and\r\nviolence. The idea of creating a new post within the United\r\nNations system, that of a high commissioner for human\r\nrights, is an expression of the desire to step up international\r\ncooperation in this field. We are prepared to participate\r\nactively in discussing this matter.\r\nLet us look at the United Nations potential for crisis\r\nmanagement. Many of the proposed ideas hold out promise.\r\nBut if they are to materialize, the United Nations must live\r\nup to its coordinating, organizing and mobilizing role in\r\nfinding the relevant political and military means. In the\r\nYugoslav crisis, for instance, the Euro-Atlantic and European\r\nsecurity organizations could have taken up some of its\r\nfunctions.\r\nHere is a case in point. The North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) has undergone a significant evolution\r\nin its attitude towards the conflict. As well as becoming a\r\nmajor challenge, the Yugoslav crisis has provided an impetus\r\nfor the alliance to review its priorities and objectives.\r\nBulgaria openly declares its readiness to enhance its\r\ncooperation - including as a full member - with NATO and\r\nits member States. Our good bilateral relations and security\r\ncooperation with Turkey and Greece illustrate clearly our\r\napproach and intentions. It would be beneficial to Balkan\r\nand European security if these relations could be developed\r\nfurther into cooperation between allies within NATO.\r\nBulgaria is willing and able to shoulder responsibility and\r\nact as a reliable partner.\r\nAddressing today’s global social and economic\r\nproblems calls for new approaches in the work of the United\r\nNations specialized bodies in these areas. New ways and\r\nmeans should be sought to facilitate access to technical\r\nassistance and modern technologies. There is a need for\r\ndaring and pragmatic initiatives in areas such as trade\r\nliberalization, the future of the General Agreement on Tariffs\r\nand Trade (GATT), external debt, labour migration,\r\nunemployment, environmental safety and the proliferation of\r\nenvironmentally friendly technologies. The Republic of\r\nBulgaria is ready to cooperate in any of the above-mentioned\r\nefforts as a member of various United Nations bodies,\r\nincluding possibly the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe strengthening of the regime of the Treaty on the\r\nnon-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the preparation\r\nfor the review Conference in 1995 are of paramount\r\nimportance. Bulgaria shares the view that the non-\r\nproliferation Treaty should become universal and be of\r\nindefinite duration.\r\nBulgaria’s expectations for the future role and functions\r\nof the United Nations determine its attitude towards the\r\nongoing reform of the world Organization. On the basis of\r\nits history of nearly 50 years, the Member States can identify\r\nelements of its Charter and structure that need revision and\r\nothers that are universal and lasting and whose validity\r\nshould not be questioned. Clearly, such decisions can be\r\nreached only after serious debate and by consensus of the\r\nMember States, notably the permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council. It is essential to preserve the Security\r\nCouncil as an effective decision-making mechanism if its\r\nrepresentation is broadened. The powers and responsibility\r\nof the Secretary-General will certainly change, with an\r\nincreasing emphasis on his diplomatic and peace-making\r\nefforts.\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe Bulgarian delegation is taking part in the forty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly and making its\r\ncontribution as an active member of the international\r\ncommunity. Our commitment to the problems and the future\r\nof the Organization is prompted by our awareness of being\r\namong the staunchest supporters of its cause and noble\r\nmissions.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nBulgaria for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Zhelyu Zhelev, President of the Republic of\r\nBulgaria, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nADDRESS BY HIS SERENE HIGHNESS PRINCE\r\nHANS-ADAM II OF LIECHTENSTEIN, HEAD OF\r\nS T A T E O F T H E P R I N C I P A L I T Y O F\r\nLIECHTENSTEIN\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Head of State of the Principality of\r\nLiechtenstein, His Serene Highness Prince Hans-Adam II of\r\nLiechtenstein.\r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Hans-Adam II of\r\nLiechtenstein, Head of State of the Principality of\r\nLiechtenstein, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nHead of State of the Principality of Liechtenstein, His Serene\r\nHighness Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPrince HANS-ADAM II of Liechtenstein: Allow me\r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency\r\nof the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly and to\r\nexpress our conviction that your experience and diplomatic\r\nskills will make a valuable contribution to the work of this\r\naugust body. My delegation will spare no effort to support\r\nyou in the fulfilment of your tasks. I should also like to\r\navail myself of this opportunity to thank your predecessor,\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, for the way he conducted the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly during a difficult period.\r\nOver the last eight months, this Organization has been\r\nable to welcome six new Member States: Slovakia, the\r\nCzech Republic, The Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Monaco, Eritrea and Andorra, thus enhancing\r\nthe universality of the United Nations.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly we have\r\nbeen witness to historic gains in regional disputes. The\r\nsigning of the peace agreement between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization is a unique breakthrough\r\nand will, it is hoped, lead to a just and lasting peace for the\r\nregion. When the President of the African National\r\nCongress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, spoke in this Hall on 24\r\nSeptember, he outlined the historic advances made towards\r\ndemocracy in South Africa. We are very hopeful that a new\r\nSouth Africa will play a vital role in the development of the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\nMy country was admitted to the United Nations on\r\n18 September 1990 and has tried over the last three years to\r\nmaintain as active a presence and participation as possible.\r\nWhile Liechtenstein was the 160th Member in 1990, the\r\nOrganization today has 184 members. This considerable\r\nincrease in the Organization’s membership makes it clear\r\nthat the ongoing discussion of equitable representation on\r\nand expansion of the Security Council’s membership is\r\ntimely and necessary.\r\nIn our view, the priorities in reforming the Security\r\nCouncil are cohesion and effectiveness. It is of great\r\nimportance, however, that the discussion of reforms also\r\ninclude the question of the Security Council’s work, since\r\nbroad support for its actions is an indispensable condition of\r\nits legitimacy, which can only be guaranteed by enhanced\r\ntransparency and cooperation with other Member States.\r\nArticle 23 of the Charter establishes that the contribution to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security is the\r\nfirst criterion for membership in the Council; it is obvious\r\nthat the second criterion - equitable geographical distribution\r\n- has so far not been given due attention. In view of the\r\nobvious importance of the Security Council’s composition,\r\nwe favour taking the necessary time to make adjustments\r\nbeneficial to the credibility of the Organization as a whole.\r\nThe new effectiveness of the Security Council is\r\nmanifested, among other ways, by the recent considerable\r\nincrease of peace-keeping and peacemaking missions. These\r\noperations are closely observed by the public and are often\r\ntaken as a yardstick for the activities of the United Nations\r\nas a whole. While we think it important to give more\r\nattention to other fields, such as that of social development,\r\nwe are aware of the impact that the failure or success of\r\npeace-keeping activities can have on the credibility of the\r\nOrganization. In our view, the United Nations should not\r\nengage in an ever-increasing number of peace-keeping\r\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 9\r\nmissions all over the world. A more important role should\r\nbe given to preventive diplomacy, which can be carried out\r\nby regional organizations or arrangements such as the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\r\nThe participating States consider the CSCE a regional\r\narrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the United\r\nNations Charter, and as such it provides an important link\r\nbetween European and global security. Liechtenstein, as a\r\nparticipating State, believes that enhancement of the\r\ncooperation with the CSCE is crucial; my country favours\r\nthe idea of granting observer status to that organization and\r\nhas supported the request for the inclusion of an additional\r\nitem to this effect in the agenda of the forty-eighth session.\r\nPreventive diplomacy cannot, however, replace peace-\r\nkeeping, and the United Nations must remain as active in\r\nthat field as is necessary. It must be pointed out that the\r\nexisting infrastructure in New York is not sufficient to cope\r\nwith the wide range of tasks, and urgently needs to be\r\nimproved.\r\nDeplorable events in the recent past have made it clear\r\nthat there is not sufficient protection of civil and military\r\npersonnel involved in peace-keeping missions. We therefore\r\nwholeheartedly welcome the inclusion of a new agenda item\r\nproposed by the delegation of New Zealand regarding the\r\nquestion of responsibility for attacks on United Nations and\r\nassociated personnel and measures to ensure that those\r\nresponsible for such attacks are brought to justice.\r\nWith the growing involvement of the United Nations in\r\ncomplex conflicts, the Organization’s role has been\r\ntransformed into a more active and comprehensive one. As\r\na result, relief workers expose their lives to great risk in\r\ntheir efforts to alleviate human suffering. My delegation\r\nbelieves that it simply cannot be tolerated that relief workers,\r\nwho themselves want to save lives, should become targets.\r\nThe United Nations should make it very clear that these acts\r\nof violence will not go unpunished. The emblems of the\r\nUnited Nations, the Red Cross and the Red Crescent must be\r\nrespected.\r\nHumanitarian assistance today faces the challenge of\r\nmany complex emergency situations. These challenges must\r\nbe met on the basis of the principles of neutrality,\r\nimpartiality and humanity; humanitarian aid must not be\r\npoliticized. When we are called upon to give proof of our\r\nsolidarity, we must provide the necessary financial means.\r\nWe are, however, also called upon to address the root causes\r\nof many disasters, such as poverty, population increase and\r\ncivil and ethnic strife. Imbalances feed misery; they not\r\nonly are unfair but are dangerous.\r\nForty-five years after the adoption of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, a great deal remains to be\r\ndone in this field, to which we attach particular importance.\r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights in June 1993 was\r\na very important event, and we all know how difficult it was\r\nto adopt the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.\r\nThis text can constitute a milestone in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations only if it is followed by determined action by\r\nthe General Assembly in the spirit of the Vienna\r\nDeclaration. In our view, it is of the utmost importance that\r\nthe the Centre for Human Rights be given the resources\r\nnecessary to enable it to carry out its tasks even more\r\nefficiently. In addition, the creation of the post of high\r\ncommissioner for human rights is a laudable initiative, and\r\nthe General Assembly should provide him or her with a\r\nstrong mandate within the already existing structures.\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the financial situation of the\r\nUnited Nations is disastrous. In his speech of 26 August,\r\nthe Secretary-General accordingly outlined initial steps to\r\ncope with this crisis. The measures taken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral seem to be unavoidable, and we hope they will not\r\nhave a negative impact on the work of the General\r\nAssembly. In our view, urgent action by the General\r\nAssembly is needed to prevent further deterioration, which\r\ncould have serious consequences. Punctual and full payment\r\nof the assessed contributions must be made by all States and\r\narrears must be paid in full and promptly. Proposals aimed\r\nat ensuring proper utilization of resources and establishing\r\nadequate accountability within the United Nations should be\r\ndiscussed thoroughly and expeditiously. Finally, an overall\r\nreform of the financial sector seems to be necessary. All\r\nsuggestions which might contribute to this aim, especially\r\nthose contained in the so-called Volcker-Ogata report, should\r\nbe studied with due attention.\r\nMuch has been said about the changes that have taken\r\nplace since the ending of the cold war. Unfortunately we\r\ncannot say that all these changes have been positive. To the\r\ninfinite regret and dismay of the whole international\r\ncommunity, we have continued to witness the outbreak of a\r\ngreat number of ethnic and national conflicts, accompanied\r\nby the untold suffering of innocent people. There must be\r\na better way for the world to manage its affairs. While\r\ntensions within and between communities may be an\r\ninevitable part of the human condition, it is, in our view, of\r\nthe utmost importance that ways be found to defuse them\r\npeacefully and without bloodshed.\r\nIn this context, I should like to refer briefly again to an\r\nidea which might take us a step in the right direction and\r\nwhich I introduced when I had the great honour to address\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe General Assembly for the first time at its forty-sixth\r\nsession, very soon after Liechtenstein became a Member of\r\nthe United Nations. On that occasion, I ventured to suggest\r\nthat a basis for some solutions could be found within the\r\nprinciple of self-determination. The value of this great\r\nprinciple has been fully demonstrated in the traditional\r\ncontext of decolonization. But it need not be limited to that\r\ncontext. Applied also to communities within States, and\r\nallowing for them to have different levels of autonomy\r\naccording to the particular circumstances of different\r\ncommunities, it could perhaps defuse many of the tensions\r\nwhich are such a potent source of conflict. Such principles,\r\nplaced within a suitable framework, would give an effective\r\nand practical dimension to the principle of self-determination\r\nwhich it has sometimes seemed to lack. Eventually such\r\nprovisions could perhaps come to be elaborated in a\r\nconvention to be of general application.\r\nSince first putting those thoughts before this Assembly,\r\nwe in Liechtenstein have been encouraged by the degree of\r\ninterest which has been shown in them. Our ideas are\r\nflexible, although our objective - which is to find practical\r\nand effective ways of avoiding, or at least reducing, tensions\r\nbetween communities - remains firm. We have refined our\r\ninitial thoughts on the subject in the light of comments made\r\nby others, and we developed our ideas further at the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly, both during debates in the\r\nThird Committee and when the Head of Government\r\naddressed the Assembly in the course of the general debate.\r\nOn that occasion, the Head of Government announced\r\nthat the Government of Liechtenstein would be inviting each\r\nGovernment represented in the Assembly, including\r\nObservers, to nominate an independent expert to attend an\r\ninformal meeting of experts in Liechtenstein to discuss these\r\nmatters further. That meeting took place from 16 to 18\r\nMarch this year, attended by participants nominated by 46\r\nStates and international and non-governmental organizations.\r\nI attended it myself throughout, and can say personally how\r\nvaluable we found the contributions participants made to the\r\ndevelopment of our thinking. Perhaps I might be allowed to\r\ntake this opportunity to thank them all for their participation\r\nin what we see as an important and valuable project.\r\nOver the past two years we have, in these various ways,\r\ncarried forward our belief that, in the ideas first put forward\r\nto Assembly in 1991, the international community may find\r\nsome way forward in its search for ways of avoiding the\r\nkind of internal conflicts which cause ever-increasing human\r\nsuffering and which are increasingly dangerous for the peace\r\nand safety of our world. To make further progress we\r\ndecided this year to seek to inscribe an item on the\r\nAssembly’s agenda which would enable our ideas to be fully\r\ndiscussed by the full membership of the United Nations. We\r\nare grateful that our proposal was accepted and now appears\r\non the agenda for this session as item 108 (b), entitled\r\n\"Right of peoples to self-determination: Effective realization\r\nof the right of self-determination through autonomy\". We\r\nlook forward to the debate which will follow, and I hope to\r\nbe able to participate myself in at least part of it. We hope\r\nthat in the light of what may be said in the debate, the\r\nAssembly will agree that there is, in the ideas which we\r\nhave put forward, something valuable which merits further\r\nconsideration and elaboration.\r\nWe do not underestimate the difficulties ahead. We are\r\naware of the sensitivities of this whole subject, especially in\r\nthese times. Great though those difficulties and sensitivities\r\nmay be for some States, we are convinced that the needs of\r\nthe international community are even more pressing. The\r\ndangers, horrors and suffering to which tensions between\r\ncommunities within States can give rise, and of which we\r\nsadly have daily reminders, make it essential for the\r\ninternational community to make every effort to open up\r\nnew thinking in this field in order to find practical and\r\neffective means for further promoting the principles and\r\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWe consider it a great privilege to have an Organization\r\nsuch as the United Nations, founded upon a Charter which\r\nencompasses the highest ideals of humankind. I wish to take\r\nthis opportunity to reaffirm my country’s commitment to the\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of State of the\r\nPrincipality of Liechtenstein for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Hans-Adam II of\r\nLiechtenstein, Head of State of the Principality of\r\nLiechtenstein, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. DEMBRI (Algeria) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nYour unanimous election, Sir, to the presidency of the forty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly represents a just\r\nrecognition of your great diplomatic experience, your human\r\nqualities and your constant commitment to the promotion of\r\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 11\r\ndialogue and multilateral cooperation in the service of peace,\r\nsecurity and development.\r\nI should like to congratulate you most warmly on the\r\nwell-deserved tribute from the international community both\r\nto you personally and to your country. I am particularly\r\npleased that the prestigious responsibility of guiding the\r\nwork of the General Assembly has been given this year to\r\nan eminent son of Guyana, a country which, side-by-side\r\nwith Algeria, has always been resolutely in the forefront of\r\nthe defence of the cause of peace, justice, progress and\r\nunderstanding among nations.\r\nYour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, firmly and\r\ntactfully conducted a busy and productive forty-seventh\r\nsession. We wish to express our deep gratitude to him for\r\na mission accomplished with open-mindedness and\r\ndedication.\r\nI also wish to pay special tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of our Organization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nwho has spared no effort in making the United Nations rise\r\nto the many and complex challenges of a crucial period in\r\nthe development of international relations. His foresight,\r\ncourage and initiative have won him the esteem of all. His\r\npersevering activity bears for the United Nations the promise\r\nof the renewal after which our peoples fervently aspire.\r\nAlgeria extends a warm welcome to the new Member\r\nStates which have joined our Organization, and is gratified\r\nthat their accession to the membership of the United Nations\r\nwill contribute to the achievement of its objectives in the\r\nareas of peace and development.\r\nIn recent years, the history of the world has accelerated\r\nits pace considerably. Rapid and profound changes have put\r\npaid to an international order that had long been frozen in\r\nplace by the cold war. However, far from moving steadily\r\ntoward the achievement of a well-ordered international\r\nsociety, those changes have generated the makings of a\r\ndisquieting explosion. While the world changes under our\r\nvery eyes, we are unable to grasp and take cognizance of the\r\nlaws that govern such change. This dynamic, and the major\r\nupheavals it causes, have shaped a new geopolitical\r\nconfiguration in many parts of the world that has affected\r\nthe lives of many of its peoples. Given this type of change,\r\nwherein inter-State relations are jostled by a proliferation of\r\nprotagonists, of ambitions and gambles, and of the methods\r\nof international action there is a need for a collective effort\r\nto revitalize both our means of knowing and our methods of\r\naction. In short, we need to rethink the world order. We\r\nmust, as a community of nations, succeed in controlling the\r\nchanges which are taking place and the unwieldy trends that\r\nare now emerging. In this maelstrom of historical change,\r\nthis period of transition with all its hesitations and emerging\r\nglobal dangers, the thing that attracts one’s attention more\r\nthan any other is the hope, the promise of a new world order\r\nthat must be fashioned side by side with the daily suffering\r\nthat goes on in the world and which we cannot ignore.\r\nIndeed, in spite of the glowing promises of peace and\r\ninternational cooperation, the world order that is taking\r\nshape now not only contains too many old hotbeds of\r\ntension, but also gives rise to new mushrooming conflicts.\r\nTensions between ethnic and religious groups are increasing\r\nand are being exacerbated while whole regions, and even\r\nentire continents, are being marginalized in a most atrocious\r\nmanner. The right of peoples to self-determination is being\r\nviolated and obstructed here and there. Hunger and poverty\r\nare expanding. Imbalances in the world economy are\r\ndeepening and worsening. All of these situations pose\r\nchallenges to the international community that call for urgent\r\nand concerted action.\r\nIt is therefore up to us - and this is the challenge faced\r\nby all nations that are bound by an ever-growing\r\ninterdependence - to see to it that the ideals of justice and\r\npeace prevail, that new possibilities for the settlement of\r\ncertain regional conflicts and for general and complete\r\ndisarmament lead to comprehensive action eliminating the\r\nroot causes of conflicts while, at the same time, promoting\r\neconomic and social development, a prerequisite for\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThis is why it is appropriate to underscore here the fact\r\nthat the Agenda for Peace (A/47/277), whose importance is\r\nrecognized everywhere, will achieve its objectives only if it\r\nis accompanied by an agenda for development; for peace and\r\ndevelopment are closely interrelated, and conflicts too often\r\ntake root in the soil of injustice and poverty. It is obvious\r\nthat the future of the system of collective security which we\r\nwish to build will depend to a great extent on our ability to\r\nforge a consensus on the different aspects contained in the\r\nAgenda for Peace. This means that it is necessary for us to\r\ncontinue, collectively and without bias, to consider those\r\naspects of the Secretary-General’s report about which\r\ndifferences persist or which require further elaboration and\r\nconsideration.\r\nThe encouraging progress achieved in strengthening the\r\ncapability of the United Nations in the areas of active\r\npreventive diplomacy, as well as in peace-keeping and\r\npeacemaking operations, should be welcomed, but a great\r\ndeal remains to be done in this field if we are to make better\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nuse of all the experience gained in those areas by the United\r\nNations. We should see to it that our action remains strictly\r\nfaithful to the goals and principles of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. Algeria, which is honoured to participate\r\nactively and concretely in peace-keeping operations, will\r\ncontinue to do its share in this collective endeavour in the\r\nservice of peace.\r\nThe restructuring, revitalization and rationalization of\r\nthe structures of the organs of the United Nations and their\r\nworking methods have made considerable progress.\r\nHowever, this process, which is not an end in itself, will\r\nproduce its full effects only if the Member States, and\r\nparticularly the developed countries, reaffirm and strengthen\r\ntheir commitment to the United Nations and renew their\r\npolitical and financial support for its activities, particularly\r\nin the economic and social spheres.\r\nIt is this exacting and responsible approach that my\r\ncountry consistently promotes in all the areas of cooperation\r\nin which it takes part. In so doing, Algeria conducts its own\r\naction within the context of the efforts by the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement toward greater democratization of the United\r\nNations and better balance between the spheres of\r\ncompetence of its organs. In our view, it is time we\r\nreflected collectively on how to reform the Security Council,\r\nwith a view to broadening its composition, improving its\r\nworking methods and making it more accountable for its\r\naction to the entire international community in whose name\r\nit adopts its resolutions. A more representative, more\r\ntransparent Security Council that would be more cognizant\r\nof the views and concerns of all; a General Assembly that\r\nwould fully play its role in activating, guiding and\r\nsupervising; and a United Nations system that would be\r\nmore coherent and better coordinated in carrying out its\r\ndevelopment tasks: these are the three pivotal approaches\r\nthat may give to the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization\r\nsignificant political scope and operational content and\r\ngenerate the makings of a new beginning. The credibility of\r\nthe United Nations and the effectiveness of its action depend\r\non this, as do international peace, security and cooperation.\r\nAll the initiatives by my country at the national and\r\nregional levels are inspired by the ideals of peace, justice\r\nand cooperation. The national-renewal plan upon which\r\nAlgeria has embarked in the interests of political stability,\r\nthe consolidation of the democratic process, the revitalization\r\nof economic growth and the upholding of the rule of law is\r\na plan that translates into action our resolve to guarantee, for\r\nall Algerians, the rights to security and well-being in a just,\r\nmodern and democratic society.\r\nGiven this determination, our efforts in combating\r\nterrorism and our efforts aimed at providing the conditions\r\nfor real growth stem from the same overriding priority, that\r\nof meeting the expectations of our people be fulfilled by\r\nrestoring the authority of the State and creating the\r\nconditions for an orderly transition that would make possible\r\nstable and coherent progress towards a market economy\r\nthrough viable and orderly reforms.\r\nSuch a vast enterprise must find its expression and\r\nderive its support from an active foreign policy based on the\r\nprinciples and ideals of non-alignment and geared towards\r\nthe promotion of peace, stability and cooperation at the\r\nregional and international levels.\r\nIn this spirit, Algeria works steadily and resolutely for\r\nsuccess in the process of building a united Maghreb. The\r\nimportant achievements that have been made so far, which\r\nwill help us to benefit from the complementary nature of the\r\ncountries of the union of the Arab Maghreb, confirm that the\r\ndynamics of this unifying process have enabled us to\r\nmobilize our energies, despite certain persistent problems\r\nthat affect regional stability.\r\nOur country’s central position in the region, its resolve\r\nto reinforce and promote the building of the Maghreb and its\r\ncommitment to international legality have prompted it to\r\nencourage the kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front\r\nto turn to direct, sincere, constructive dialogue that can\r\nfacilitate the implementation of the peace plan prepared\r\njointly by the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, with the full agreement of the two parties\r\nconcerned.\r\nIt is important, now more than ever before, that the\r\ndialogue which was initiated at El-Ayoun between Morocco\r\nand the Polisario Front should resume and continue at an\r\nauthoritative level. Algeria, for its part, hopes that the two\r\nparties will choose the path of reason and that will do all in\r\ntheir power to resolve outstanding questions in a serious\r\nmanner and without delay, thus promoting the holding of a\r\nfree and orderly referendum on self-determination for the\r\npeople of Western Sahara. Algeria is convinced that a just\r\na lasting solution to the question of Western Sahara can\r\npromote stability and peace in the region. We therefore\r\nhope that the international community, as well as the United\r\nNations and its Secretary-General, will redouble efforts to\r\nensure, in the best conditions of credibility and impartiality,\r\nimplementation of the United Nations settlement plan, with\r\nthe complete cooperation of the two parties.\r\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 13\r\nThe same applies to the Mediterranean region. In fact,\r\nAlgeria has always worked to make that region, with the\r\nparticipation of all the States concerned, one of peace,\r\nstability and mutually advantageous cooperation. It is to this\r\nend that we continue to work for the consolidation and\r\ndeepening of political agreement in our region and for the\r\nestablishment of new types of cooperation. Algeria is\r\ntherefore making constant efforts to have the forum of \"5 +\r\n5\" activated, as this is a promising framework for\r\ncooperation between North and South in the Mediterranean.\r\nIt is in the field of disarmament that the end of the cold\r\nwar has produced tangible results most rapidly. However,\r\nconsiderable work remains to be done, especially by the\r\nnuclear Powers. The final cessation of nuclear testing in all\r\nenvironments and the renunciation of the development of\r\nnew weapon systems are objectives the attainment of which\r\nis now within the reach of the international community -\r\nprovided, of course, that the nuclear Powers go beyond\r\ncurrent agreements and summon up the necessary political\r\nwill for this purpose.\r\nIn this context, Algeria notes with interest and with\r\nhope the proposals made from this rostrum on 27 September\r\nby the President of the United States of America. The\r\ncomplete elimination of all weapons of mass destruction is,\r\nin fact, part of the logic of history. The conclusion of the\r\nConvention on the prohibition of chemical weapons has\r\nshown that this objective is no longer Utopian. Any\r\napproach to the question of disarmament and international\r\nsecurity and, in the final analysis, to the question of peace\r\nshould be universal in scope. This is a conviction that is\r\nbeing reiterated time after time by Algeria and by the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement. Disarmament, if it is to be lasting,\r\nmust take account of all aspects of the situation, and not of\r\nthe military dimension alone. It is now clear that, in an\r\nincreasingly interdependent world, peace and security cannot\r\nbe dissociated from their natural corollaries - socio-economic\r\ndevelopment and the promotion of all human rights.\r\nThe protection and promotion of human rights - all\r\nhuman rights - is a high priority for Algeria. Therefore, we\r\nare pleased at the positive results of the World Conference\r\non Human Rights, held in Vienna, which expressed support\r\nfor an integrated and global approach to human rights,\r\nwhose civil, political, economic and social aspects reinforce\r\nand complement each other.\r\nAlgeria, which subscribes completely to this view and\r\nendorses this approach, is now at a juncture that makes it an\r\nobligation of the State to give priority to human rights, to\r\nprotection of the fundamental right to life and to personal\r\nsecurity. In this context, the restoration of public order and\r\nthe struggle against terrorism are manifestations of Algeria’s\r\ndetermination to give a firm guarantee of the development\r\nof human rights and the building of a lasting democracy\r\nbased on the rule of law, the changeover of political power\r\nbetween parties and republican principles.\r\nThis declared struggle against terrorism has an internal\r\naspect, but it has international dimensions as well. Here we\r\nshould like to make it abundantly clear that Algeria will\r\ncontinue to oppose, firmly and with the utmost\r\ndetermination, every outside attempt at destabilization and\r\nthat it will tolerate no interference in its internal affairs. It\r\nis Algeria’s belief that the international community must\r\nassert itself and mobilize its energy to defeat the modern\r\nbarbarity of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nIt is therefore important for the deliberations at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly vigorously to lead to the\r\nformulation of an international convention on the prevention\r\nand repression of terrorism.\r\nWhile a number of regional conflicts are on the way to\r\npacification and lasting settlement, others, however, there is\r\nno peaceful, just solution in sight.\r\nIn the Middle East, which has been buffeted for\r\ndecades by waves of suffering and confrontation, new\r\nprospects are emerging. Algeria welcomed the recent\r\nagreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\n(PLO) and Israel and expressed the hope that it would be the\r\nfirst step towards an overall settlement of the Middle East\r\nconflict in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967) and 338 (1973). Now as in the past, Algeria which\r\nstands firmly behind the independence of decision-making by\r\nthe Palestinian leaders calls upon the Palestinians to close\r\nranks and reaffirms its support for the PLO.\r\nAt this crucial stage for the future of the region, Algeria\r\nbelieves that the international community continues to be\r\nresponsible for building peace. For that peace to be genuine\r\nand lasting, it must be comprehensive and must meet the\r\nnational aspirations of the Palestinian people and restore all\r\nthe territories occupied by Israel, including Al-Quds Al-\r\nSharif.\r\nAs an Arab country, Algeria, naturally, is intimately\r\ninvolved in the future of the Arab world. Overcoming the\r\naftermath of the Gulf war ought to open the way to the\r\ninter-Arab reconciliation for which our peoples fervently\r\nhope. Since Iraq has undertaken to meet fully all the\r\nobligations stemming from Security Council resolutions and\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsince international law has established the geographical basis\r\nfor peaceful neigbourliness between Iraq and Kuwait, we\r\nhope that the outstanding humanitarian questions will soon\r\nbe resolved so that the collective conscience of the Arab\r\npeoples may be able finally to heal itself of the scars of the\r\nGulf war.\r\nMy country reaffirms its support for the Government of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates in its legitimate efforts to regain\r\nsovereignty over the three islands under illegal foreign\r\noccupation.\r\nAlgeria welcomes with hope the positive developments\r\nin South Africa, despite the continuing violence and other\r\nfactors that endanger peace. The agreement to set up the\r\nTransitional Executive Council holds promise for the speedy\r\nachievement of a united, democratic, non-racial South\r\nAfrica. Chairman Nelson Mandela’s call from this rostrum\r\nfor the lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa is\r\nfurther testimony to his lofty sense of responsibility and an\r\nillustration of the progress that has been achieved in the\r\npeaceful dismantling of apartheid. This development\r\ndeserves the full attention of the international community,\r\nwhich should spare no effort in contributing to putting an\r\nend to the inter-ethnic violence and to provide the means by\r\nwhich the democratic forces can participate effectively in the\r\nlong-awaited elections.\r\nAlgeria also follows attentively developments in several\r\nfraternal African countries. We encourage the peace efforts\r\nof the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) and the relevant subregional organizations. We note\r\nwith satisfaction the progress achieved in Mozambique,\r\nRwanda and Liberia, and express the hope that those\r\ncountries will overcome their problems with the help of the\r\ninternational community and devote all their energy to\r\nreconstruction and development. We hope that peace and\r\nharmony will be restored in Angola in accordance with the\r\nagreements reached between the two parties and with the\r\nresolutions of the Security Council, which have clearly\r\ndetermined where the responsibilities lie.\r\nWe are gravely concerned about the ongoing violence\r\nin Somalia, particularly in Mogadishu. It reminds us that\r\nhumanitarian assistance and promoting political solutions\r\nmust go hand in hand. The tragedy of Somalia is the most\r\ntelling symbol to date of Africa’s marginalization in\r\ninternational relations, and it attests to the tragic effects of\r\nthe international community’s inadequate response to\r\nAfrica’s clear needs with respect to economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe tragedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a challenge\r\nto the world’s conscience. In spite of the Security Council’s\r\nmany resolutions, the acquisition of territory by force,\r\n\"ethnic cleansing\" and trampling of all the norms of\r\ninternational law continue to prevail there. In the absence of\r\nfirm action by the international community, the\r\ndismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a State Member\r\nof the United Nations, continues unabated, and puts at risk\r\nthe peace and stability of that country and of the region as\r\na whole. Algeria expresses its solidarity with the Bosnian\r\npeople, and most particularly with its Muslims, who have\r\nbeen the victim of untold hardships. We appeal to the\r\ninternational community to reject the fait accompli imposed\r\nby aggression and help protect the independence, sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nThe international situation is not disturbing at the\r\npolitical and security levels alone but is also causing concern\r\nbecause of the persistence of world recession, the\r\ndeteriorating economic situation of the developing countries,\r\nand the grave instability brought about by profound changes\r\nin international economic relations.\r\nAt a time when our interdependent world is in the\r\nmidst of a complex and perilous historic transition, the\r\ncommunication gap between North and South must come to\r\nan end. The universal imperative of peace, security and\r\ndevelopment makes us consider the developing situation in\r\nthe countries of the South. Most of them are facing the\r\nchallenges of globalization with economies made uniquely\r\nvulnerable by the crushing weight of foreign indebtedness,\r\ntheir precarious internal balance and a highly unfavourable\r\ninternational economic environment.\r\nThe efforts of developing countries to promote\r\neconomic growth and make the structural changes necessary\r\nfor development are made far more difficult and risky by the\r\nerosion of multilateral cooperation, the conflicting interests\r\nof the dominant economic players and the constraints\r\nimposed by economic decisions that are too often selfish and\r\nexclusionary.\r\nIt is therefore essential to respond in a concerted\r\nfashion to the need for an orderly restructuring of\r\ninternational economic relations by establishing coordinated\r\nmechanisms to regulate the functioning of the world\r\neconomy. In this context, it is important that the questions\r\nof debt, the scarcity of capital and technology inflows, to the\r\ncountries of the South, the continued decline in commodity\r\nprices, the deterioration of the terms of trade and the\r\ndifficulty of access to markets should become the focus of\r\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 15\r\nthe international community’s attention in order for us to\r\nfind lasting solutions to such problems.\r\nSuch a collective concerted type of action that would be\r\nconsonant with the requirements of adjustment by the\r\ndeveloping countries themselves, is a must if we are to\r\nrelaunch the international economy on a fair and well-\r\nbalanced basis and make it possible for the developing\r\ncountries to reap the expected benefits from the economic\r\nreforms they have undertaken. This would make meaningful\r\nthe sacrifices being made by the developing countries in\r\nundertaking the necessary restructuring changes aimed at\r\nrelaunching their economies and integrating them into the\r\nworld economy. It would also make it possible for the\r\ninternational community to learn from the experiences\r\nacquired in debt management and structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes. Lastly, it would promote the creation of a true\r\nmarket environment in the developing countries.\r\nThe Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro demonstrated that\r\nenvironmental protection is inconceivable without the\r\npromotion of sustainable development and sustained growth\r\nin the developing countries. We must therefore work\r\ndeterminedly towards achieving this objective and place\r\nsustainable development on the agenda of the new world\r\norder.\r\nThe holding of a world summit on social development\r\nscheduled for 1995 to deal with problems of human security\r\naffords us an opportunity to engage in an international\r\ndialogue on the implications and results of transition in the\r\nworld. The United Nations and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions must grasp these new problems and contribute to\r\ndeveloping a new framework for reflection and guidance to\r\ndirect better the evolution of the international system. This\r\nendeavour may seem difficult, but it is essential for a better\r\nunderstanding of this new order, which we wish to be\r\nbalanced, fair and consensual. It would also tend to support\r\nthe Secretary-General’s efforts to draw up an agenda for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt a time when our Organization faces various\r\nchallenges, the reform, restructuring and revitalization\r\nprocess now under way in the United Nations acquires\r\nspecial importance. Restructuring the Secretariat and the\r\neconomic and social sectors, revitalizing the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, relaunching the operational development\r\nactivities of the United Nations system and assuring the\r\nstable and predictable growth of its resources are all tasks\r\nthat should be combined to give multilateral action the\r\nutmost credibility and effectiveness.\r\nThis undertaking is part of the vast effort to equip the\r\nUnited Nations for and adapt it to present and future\r\nchallenges, and it requires participation by all of us. This\r\nendeavour is the vessel for feeding the faith of the peoples\r\nof the United Nations in an indivisible humankind. It is\r\nbound to succeed so long as our more democratic and more\r\neffective Organization is the active centre and catalyst for\r\nthe promotion of fair and equitably shared development and\r\nthe foundation of a peace built by mankind as a whole.\r\nMr. SULEIMENOV (Kazakhstan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Allow me first of all, Sir, to associate myself with\r\nthe congratulations already extended to you on your election\r\nto the high office of President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-eighth session and to wish you every success in your\r\nendeavours.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of\r\nKazakhstan, I should like to convey deep sympathy to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the friendly country of India\r\nfor the heavy death toll and considerable material loss\r\ncaused by the devastating earthquake on 30 September.\r\nThe international realities that form the background of\r\nthe current session are a direct reflection of the development\r\nof extremely contradictory tendencies within the world\r\ncommunity. On the one hand, during the year gone by since\r\nthe beginning of the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly we have witnessed a dynamic development of\r\ninternational relations along with increased United Nations\r\nactivity in the resolution of global economic, social and\r\nenvironmental issues and in the promotion of peace and\r\nsecurity. The achievement of agreement on the Middle East\r\nproblem should undoubtedly be counted as a breakthrough\r\nin multilateral diplomacy, but, on the other hand, we must\r\nstate with regret that no agreement has been reached so far\r\non the cessation of hostilities in the former Yugoslavia, that\r\nthe tension in Somalia has increased and that hotbeds of\r\nconflicts still smoulder in a number of republics of the\r\nformer Soviet Union.\r\nWe have made a careful study of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/48/1) on the work of the Organization\r\nand share its principal conclusion that in order to produce\r\nenduring results there must at all costs be a new level of\r\npolitical will and realism.\r\nThe President of the United States, Mr. Clinton, pointed\r\nout in his statement on 27 September that the United Nations\r\nsimply cannot be engaged in each and every one of the\r\nconflicts in the world. This goes without saying. But it is\r\nequally self-evident that the United Nations is today, and\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nwill remain in the foreseeable future, a body to which\r\nhumanity - the world’s nations and individuals - will link\r\ntheir aspirations for peace, development and human rights.\r\nIn these circumstances, in our opinion, a package of\r\nconcrete measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of\r\nthe United Nations is called for. We believe that, along with\r\na further definition of the functions of the United Nations\r\nmain organs, the elimination of duplication in their activities\r\nand the adequate financing of United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations, it is high time to consider the question of\r\nexpanding the permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. We are confident that this measure will enable the\r\nUnited Nations to respond more rapidly and objectively to\r\nthe new, dangerous challenges of the times and eruptions of\r\nviolence, regardless of where this might happen.\r\nThe harsh realities of the post-confrontation era have\r\nhighlighted the urgency of redirecting the efforts of the\r\nworld community towards eliminating the potential for\r\ndisputes within a State or between States to escalate into\r\nmilitary conflicts. Should we fail to resolve disputes at an\r\nearly stage, we will simply reap fruits similar to those reaped\r\nin the former Yugoslavia, Nagorny-Karabakh and Tajikistan.\r\nThis reaffirms once again the appropriateness of the idea of\r\npreventive diplomacy formulated by Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali in his report \"An Agenda for Peace\". Only\r\nby taking a series of preventive measures based on global\r\nand regional cooperation between nations can peace be\r\nensured and maintained.\r\nThis is at the heart of the idea of creating a system of\r\ncollective security in Asia within the framework of the\r\nConference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures\r\nin Asia (CICMA). As is known, this initiative was\r\nformulated comprehensively by Mr. Nazarbaev, President of\r\nthe Republic of Kazakhstan, precisely one year ago, at the\r\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly. To promote\r\nthe realization of the initiative, Kazakhstan hosted two\r\nrounds of expert-level meetings within the framework of\r\npreparations for CICMA, which took place this year in\r\nAlmaty and yielded promising results. At present, 25 Asian\r\nStates are involved in the CICMA process. I take this\r\nopportunity to invite other States interested in strengthening\r\nconfidence-building measures in Asia to join our efforts. I\r\nbelieve that today we should actively broaden our efforts to\r\ndefine the problems related to this initiative. I have in mind\r\nparticularly the preparations for the conference of Foreign\r\nMinisters of Asian States which, in the view of experts,\r\ncould be convened in 1994.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the idea of regional\r\ncooperation in Asia has been endorsed by the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and has found\r\na broad response within the United Nations, the Conference\r\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the League of\r\nArab States. This positive reaction to our initiative fills us\r\nwith confidence in its viability and its significance for the\r\ncause of peace in Asia.\r\nIndeed, the States of the Asian region have an equally\r\nstrong interest in the prevention and peaceful settlement of\r\nconflicts as well as in the prevention of the emergence of\r\nnew hotbeds of regional and global tension. As an example\r\nI would mention the formation of the Defence Coalition\r\nForces of the members of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS), which acted as a restraining factor\r\nin the Tajik conflict. Joint military units of Russia,\r\nKazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan managed to reduce\r\nconsiderably the scale of military confrontation, saved the\r\nlives of thousands of civilians and provided relief for\r\nhundreds of thousands of refugees. In this context, the\r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, along with the other\r\nCommonwealth States, is asking for support for our joint\r\nappeal to recognize the Defence Coalition Forces of the CIS\r\nas the United Nations peacemaking force in that region.\r\nAnother important aspect of close cooperation between\r\nAsian States is the coordination of their efforts on\r\nenvironmental issues. The severe environmental problems\r\nof Kazakhstan are well known. The first among them is the\r\nproblem of the Aral Sea. The critical situation in the Aral\r\nregion has frequently been discussed at various international\r\nconferences and meetings of Heads of States. As a result,\r\nwe now have a sizeable package of documents defining\r\nshort-term and strategic solutions to the problem. We point\r\nin particular to the signing of the Agreement on Joint\r\nActivities in Preserving the Aral Sea and the Environmental\r\nRehabilitation of the Region and the Statute of the\r\nInternational Fund for Preserving the Aral Sea. However,\r\nwe are convinced that this environmental tragedy has effects\r\nfar beyond the confines of the region. Today, only the\r\ncollective efforts of the world community can bring about a\r\nsolution to this problem. We therefore support the proposal\r\nput forward by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan,\r\nMr. Karimov, to set up a special United Nations forum,\r\nperhaps a United Nations commission on the Aral Sea.\r\nAnother priority in the foreign policy of our Republic\r\nis the strengthening of intergovernmental relations within the\r\nCIS. We are confident that at present no member State of\r\nthe Commonwealth is able effectively to pursue its internal\r\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 17\r\nand foreign policy in isolation from the policies of the other\r\nmembers of the CIS. In this context, the President of the\r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, Mr. Nazarbaev, has repeatedly\r\nproposed concrete measures to consolidate the common\r\neconomic space and ensure social and political stability on\r\na collective basis.\r\nAt the recent meeting of the Heads of State of the CIS\r\nin Moscow, an economic union of the Commonwealth was\r\nset up for the purpose of coordinating the policies of\r\nmember States in various fields. This serves the interests of\r\nall members of the CIS.\r\nKazakhstan will remain active in promoting the\r\nintegration of the members of the CIS. We strongly believe\r\nthat all emerging political problems and conflict situations\r\nshould be resolved in constructive and civilized ways. This\r\nidea is the essence of two recent statements by President\r\nNazarbaev on the current critical situation in the Russian\r\nFederation.\r\nOur State has a diversified foreign policy, and the\r\nexpansion of cooperation in all fields with all countries is of\r\nutmost strategic importance to us. After signing the Lisbon\r\nProtocol of 23 May 1992, the Republic of Kazakhstan, along\r\nwith other States successors to the USSR, was recognized as\r\na party to the START I Treaty and undertook to accede to\r\nthe non-proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear State. At\r\npresent, negotiations are under way with a number of States\r\non cooperation in assisting Kazakhstan to meet its\r\ncommitments to eliminate strategic offensive weapons.\r\nIn this context, I share the opinion of my Ukrainian\r\ncolleague, Mr. Zlenko, about the extreme complexity of this\r\nproblem. In our opinion, Kazakhstan would need\r\nconsiderable funds for this purpose: approximately $2\r\nbillion - not an easy sum to find in our national budget.\r\nThese funds are needed not only to cover the dismantling of\r\nnuclear weapons, but also to eliminate the consequences of\r\nnuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk Testing Ground and to\r\nsolve the Aral sea crisis as well.\r\nReferring to the problem of the elimination of the\r\nconsequences of nuclear tests at the now-closed\r\nSemipalatinsk Testing Ground, I should like to draw the\r\nAssembly’s attention to the enormous damage to the health\r\nof the people of a vast region wrought by 466 nuclear tests\r\nin all environments. In varying degrees, almost half a\r\nmillion Kazakh citizens have suffered the deadly effects of\r\nnuclear tests. It is quite understandable, therefore, that\r\nKazakhstan wholeheartedly supports a comprehensive and\r\ncomplete ban on nuclear tests.\r\nOne of the active areas of Kazakhstan’s foreign policy\r\nis cooperation with the CSCE and the North Atlantic\r\nCooperation Council. The possibilities of Kazakhstan’s\r\nmore regular and active participation in CSCE activities\r\nwere discussed in particular with the CSCE Chairman,\r\nMargaretha af Ugglas, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nSweden, during a visit of the CSCE delegation to Almaty\r\nlast June.\r\nBroadly speaking, our foreign policy can now be\r\ndescribed as dynamic and active. Kazakhstan’s membership\r\nof the United Nations has allowed it to become actively\r\ninvolved in international life, a fact reflected in our\r\nmembership now of 20 international organizations, including\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the World\r\nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF), and others. The Republic’s\r\nmembership in the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization (UNIDO), the Economic Commission for\r\nEurope (ECE) and other international organizations is under\r\nconsideration.\r\nKazakhstan’s internal reforms are being carried out in\r\naccordance with the international treaties to which it has\r\nacceded. In spite of major economic problems, which are\r\ncommon in varying degrees to the States of the former\r\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics, a strong legal basis for\r\neconomic reforms has been laid down in our Republic.\r\nThe laws passed by the Kazakhstan Parliament are\r\ndesigned to develop medium- and small-scale business,\r\nattract and protect foreign investments and liberalize foreign\r\ntrade. Providing a legal basis for foreign economic activity\r\nenvisages a gradual decrease of export and import duties and\r\nthe removal of free trade barriers which had to be imposed\r\nduring the transition period because of the particular features\r\nof that time. Of course, such transformations will take more\r\nthan one or two years, but Kazakhstan intends to carry them\r\nout as soon as possible.\r\nKazakhstan has now begun to attract international\r\nbusiness. Following deals with Chevron and other major\r\nforeign companies, which have demonstrated to the world\r\nbusiness community that Kazakhstan is anxious to attract\r\nforeign investment on a mutually beneficial basis and ensure\r\na favourable environment for it, the flow of foreign\r\ninvestment into the Republic’s economy has been growing\r\nsteadily, and this is raising our hopes for the ultimate\r\nsuccess of our reforms.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nWe understand clearly that now, at a time when our\r\nRepublic is reaching out to the world community and is\r\ndeclaring its willingness to join it as an equal and respected\r\nmember, it is of particular importance for us to affirm our\r\ncompliance with internationally recognized standards of\r\nhuman rights. The Constitution of the Republic of\r\nKazakhstan adopted in January 1993 recognizes, in\r\naccordance with international standards, the primacy of\r\nrights and freedoms of the individual and places the primacy\r\nof the interests of the individual above the interests of the\r\nState and society, proclaims the ideas of civil peace and\r\nethnic accord, and the equality of all nations and ethnic\r\ngroups living in the Republic. I wish to draw attention to\r\nthe fact that Kazakhstan is the only one of the newly formed\r\nStates of the former USSR where national radio and TV\r\nprogrammes are broadcast in six different languages,\r\nnewspapers and magazines are published in seven languages\r\nand instruction in schools is given in 18 languages.\r\nKazakhstan’s commitment to equal rights for all ethnic\r\ngroups in economic and social development was clearly\r\nstated at the World Conference on Human Rights held in\r\nVienna last June. The documents adopted at that Conference\r\nwill undoubtedly serve as an important guarantee of the\r\nobservance of human rights both at the international and at\r\nthe national levels.\r\nHowever, the practical realization of human rights and\r\nfreedoms is a long and gradual process which depends on\r\nmany factors such as the level of economic and political\r\ndevelopment of the society, the ideological priorities, the\r\nnational mentality, and so on. It is therefore unjustifiable for\r\nsome people to assume the responsibility for setting human\r\nrights standards and to use their own interpretation of the\r\nconcept as an instrument of pressure on certain countries in\r\nquestions related to bilateral or multilateral relations.\r\nIn this context, Kazakhstan, while supporting efforts to\r\naffirm the universal nature of human rights, believes that it\r\nis necessary to take into account the specific national\r\nconditions of each member of the world community. The\r\nproblem of human rights is not only pressing but also\r\ndelicate, and hence it requires an extremely careful and\r\nbalanced approach. It is this understanding which drives the\r\ninternal ethnic policy of our country, a State the very\r\nstability of which depends upon the peaceful and mutually\r\nrespectful coexistence of ethnic groups.\r\nThe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly is the\r\nsecond one in which Kazakhstan has participated as a full\r\nMember of the United Nations. Despite such recent\r\nmembership in the Organization, Kazakhstan has actively\r\nparticipated in the promotion of international relations,\r\ncontributed to the strengthening of processes of integration,\r\nand has offered its own ideas on how to improve the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe reaffirm our readiness to make an active\r\ncontribution to the work of the Organization and to support\r\nall endeavours aimed at enhancing international cooperation\r\nand achieving peace and international accord.\r\nAt the same time I should like particularly to point out\r\nthat the United Nations today is an international forum of\r\n184 Member States, including those which, like Kazakhstan,\r\nonly recently gained their independence. Considerable\r\nexpansion of the membership over the past few years has, in\r\nour view, broadened the range and diversity of opinion\r\nwithin the Organization as well as pluralism in approaches\r\nto the analysis of international political events. To achieve\r\nconsensus today we need a collective search for new\r\nprinciples of coexistence of States in the United Nations, as\r\nwell as the improvement\r\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 19\r\nand adaptation of the Organization to the rapidly changing\r\nrealities of modern life.\r\nIt is for this reason that we call upon all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations to consider our proposal to\r\nconvene a special session of the General Assembly devoted\r\nto the problems of strengthening international peace and\r\nsecurity, expanding the scope and potential of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, promoting human rights, and enhancing the role\r\nof the United Nations in an interdependent and integrated\r\nworld.\r\nWe believe that on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations it would be extremely useful to discuss\r\nnew goals and the challenges facing the Organization.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n"
