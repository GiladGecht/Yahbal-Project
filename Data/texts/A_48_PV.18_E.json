"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n18th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nWednesday, 6 October 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.35 a.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. KIJINER (Marshall Islands): On behalf of the\r\npeople and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands, I warmly congratulate Ambassador Samuel Insanally\r\non his election as President of what promises to be a historic\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I would also like to\r\nexpress my country’s profound appreciation to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, Foreign Minister of\r\nBulgaria, for his superior guidance during a time of\r\nunprecedented change.\r\nWe are gathered here at a crucial juncture in human\r\nhistory when numerous changes are becoming apparent.\r\nFew of us ever imagined that we would witness in our\r\nlifetimes the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, a handshake\r\nbetween the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization, the peaceful separation of Eritrea from\r\nEthiopia after decades of war, or the transition to a\r\nGovernment in South Africa that is truly representative of its\r\npeople. In the current international climate we can be\r\noptimistic about the peaceful resolution of the difficult\r\nproblems of our time. However, at the same time our world\r\nwitnesses these triumphs of the human spirit, it also faces\r\ngrave new problems, such as the tragedies that are unfolding\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Somalia.\r\nThe new order will require fundamental changes in the\r\nattitudes and thinking of nations and all mankind. Gone are\r\nthe clearly defined divisions of super-Power conflict. In\r\ntheir place are a myriad of problems, suppressed during the\r\ncold war, that are now resurfacing. The confrontation\r\nbetween East and West has given way to more intricate\r\nproblems, without readily apparent solutions. There are no\r\neasy answers for bringing restraint to the extremes of ethnic\r\nand religious nationalism, or promoting human rights and\r\nsustainable development. Yet the past few months have\r\nshown the real progress that can be made on even the most\r\nintractable problems. Rather than wringing our hands, we\r\nmust draw upon the diversity of views represented in this\r\ngrand Hall and upon the examples of those who dedicated\r\ntheir lives to the struggle to bring peace to the world.\r\nThe world’s billions are increasingly looking to the\r\nUnited Nations for solutions. However, as currently\r\nstructured and financed, the United Nations by itself cannot\r\naccommodate the breadth and gravity of the many problems\r\nit faces. It is our view that the Organization must be\r\ncarefully re-evaluated to ensure its effectiveness in a\r\nsituation of new realities. We support the creation of an\r\nOffice of Inspector General and will continue to study the\r\nvarious proposals for expansion of the Security Council\r\nmembership.\r\nAs proud Members of this body, we cheer our\r\nOrganization’s successes and are troubled by its few\r\nsetbacks. The Marshallese people mourn the loss of\r\nmembers of United Nations peace-keeping missions, which\r\nare bravely endeavouring to maintain peace and provide\r\nassistance to those in danger.\r\nAllow me, for a moment, to address the special\r\nsituation of the island nations. The physical limitations of\r\nislands and their lack of natural resources, which larger\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86770 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.18\r\n22 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nnations might regard as insurmountable barriers, we, by\r\nnecessity, view as challenges to overcome. Throughout\r\nhistory, islanders have displayed a remarkable degree of\r\ninnovation and adaptation, which has allowed us to survive\r\nnumerous natural and man-made disasters. Our people and\r\nway of life were not deterred by the horrors of modern\r\nweaponry from which the Marshallese people suffered\r\nduring the nuclear testing. Despite the end of the super-\r\nPower arms race, the world must still confront the grave\r\ndangers of nuclear testing, nuclear proliferation, and the\r\nproduction, transit and disposal of nuclear material. The\r\nMarshall Islands will forever have a special interest in the\r\ndismantling of nuclear weapons because many Marshallese\r\npeople are still prevented from returning to their ancestors’\r\nhomeland.\r\nAs survivors of that legacy, we very much welcomed\r\nthe nuclear-testing moratorium. We are greatly distressed\r\nthat this moratorium has now been broken by one of the\r\nnuclear Powers, and we would appeal to the others not to\r\nfollow this path. I should like to lend my Government’s\r\nvoice to the voices of others that have called for negotiations\r\non a lasting and effective comprehensive nuclear-test-ban\r\ntreaty that will enjoy universal adherence. It is the wish of\r\nthe people of the Marshall Islands that no one else should\r\nhave to endure the same hardships and physical harm that\r\nwe did. We pray for a world free from nuclear testing and\r\nintend to participate actively in the steps leading to such a\r\ntreaty.\r\nWe were proud to be one of the first signatories of the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\r\non Their Destruction earlier this year in Paris. We will do\r\nour part to contribute to the goal of the abolition of that\r\nimmoral class of weapons and commend the many officials\r\nwho worked on the Convention for their tireless efforts.\r\nPerhaps the most effective way to avoid the grave\r\nconsequences of nuclear weapons is to address the problem\r\nat its source by prohibiting the production of weapons-grade\r\nplutonium. We therefore look forward to working on a\r\ntreaty to this effect, and we commend the United States and\r\nothers for taking the lead in this regard.\r\nThe islands of the Pacific are especially vulnerable to\r\nthe dangers posed by transport of nuclear material. We hope\r\nthat such shipments will cease. If they are to continue, the\r\nStates responsible must take every precaution to ensure that\r\nthe safety of States along the sea lanes and the high seas is\r\nensured.\r\nAll of humanity is shocked by the brutality of\r\nnationalist and ethnic conflicts raging throughout the world\r\ntoday. The possibility of introducing nuclear weapons in\r\nthese disputes threatens global peace and security and raises\r\nthe spectre of death and suffering on a magnitude never\r\nbefore witnessed. My Government will continue to support\r\nall efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.\r\nThe efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) in the area of nuclear safeguards merit special\r\npraise. I am very pleased to report that last week the\r\nMarshall Islands was accepted as a member of the IAEA,\r\nand we look forward to contributing to the work of the\r\nAgency. We are confident that the Agency’s vast expertise\r\nin the area of protection from radiation can shed light on the\r\nmatter and at the same time come up with remedial\r\ntreatment for the many Marshallese victims afflicted by\r\nnumerous cancerous diseases resulting from nuclear testing.\r\nMy Government warmly applauds the increased\r\nattention by the world community to human rights and\r\ndemocratic institutions. Although it fell short of some of our\r\nexpectations, this year’s World Conference on Human Rights\r\nwas an important milestone in the efforts to protect the\r\nrights of individuals and vulnerable sectors of society.\r\nPerhaps more important, the Vienna Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action clearly demonstrated that respect for\r\nbasic human rights and fundamental freedoms can exist in a\r\ncontext of cultural diversity.\r\nAs important as the Vienna Declaration is, it is\r\nmeaningless without the means to enforce its provisions.\r\nWe will therefore continue strongly to support efforts aimed\r\nat creating a post of United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights and a Special Rapporteur for Women’s\r\nRights, and we will continue to study proposals for an\r\ninternational court with jurisdiction to consider cases of\r\nhuman-rights violations.\r\nTomorrow’s leaders are today’s children. With this in\r\nmind, we must ensure that our children are well prepared to\r\naccept the mantle that will be passed on to them. For\r\ndecades, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has\r\nadvanced this objective with determination, and we are\r\nespecially appreciative of its assistance to the Marshallese\r\nchildren. We are proud to have recently ratified the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, and we encourage\r\nothers to do the same so that the world may attain\r\nUNICEF’s goal of universal adherence by the year 2000.\r\nThe Marshall Islands are endowed with natural beauty\r\nand a rich cultural heritage. The development potential of\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 3\r\nour islands resides in the preservation of their fragile\r\nenvironment. Because our land area is so limited, we treat\r\nit with the greatest respect and conserve it as best we can.\r\nGiven the small land area of our atolls, we face\r\nconstraints to agricultural and industrial development. As\r\nthe pressure from a growing population increases in my\r\ncountry, additional demands are made on our resources.\r\nRegrettably, we have become increasingly dependent on\r\nimports to meet basic human needs.\r\nThe long distances from markets of many islands result\r\nin especially high transport costs. In our case, we are almost\r\n2,000 miles from the nearest major market for our goods.\r\nConsequently, transport costs raise the cost of goods to\r\nlevels that are often not competitive. Even with competitive\r\nproducts, restrictive trade barriers further limit our access to\r\nmarkets. We are hopeful that the negotiations of the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will produce a\r\ntrade agreement that is equitable and fair to all nations.\r\nThe Marshall Islands welcomes with gratitude the\r\nrecently approved country programme of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). It would be especially\r\nwelcome if this plan of action could assist my country\r\nsignificantly along the road to sustainable development. The\r\nspirit of cooperation that was exhibited at the first round-\r\ntable meeting in 1991 is evident in this programme. It is\r\nhoped that this will be the first step in a long and fruitful\r\npartnership and that the UNDP will become more responsive\r\nto the special needs of the Marshall Islands. Like many of\r\nthe island States in the region, the Marshall Islands is not a\r\ntraditional recipient of overseas development aid, and we\r\nhave few bilateral partners. Given its regional expertise, we\r\nare pleased that UNDP is becoming a major focal point for\r\nour development assistance. UNDP understands the\r\ncomplexities of the Pacific region and the development\r\nchallenge for the island States. We hope that the UNDP\r\nbudget for the region will not be cut back any further. The\r\nPacific is a vast area, and the logistical challenges faced by\r\nthe field office in Suva, Fiji, are daunting.\r\nSustainable development is a primary objective of\r\nGovernment planning. We are increasingly aware of the\r\nlimits that constrain our development potential. We want to\r\nprosper on the resources that we have, but we do not want\r\nto repeat mistakes that others have made on their road to\r\ndevelopment. I commend our neighbour, Papua New\r\nGuinea, for the important work it has initiated to integrate\r\nsustainable development into the framework of international\r\nrelations.\r\nThe Marshall Islands is a small nation, and we\r\nincreasingly feel the strain caused by our expenditures on the\r\nUnited Nations. We are, of course, very grateful and proud\r\nto be a part of this body, but we are becoming worried at the\r\nscale of new contributions, particularly for peace-keeping\r\noperations. The burden of membership is not shared equally\r\nby every citizen of the world, and we would like to see this\r\ninequity in contributions addressed in some way. If one\r\nlooks at the cost of United Nations membership on a per\r\ncapita basis, one sees that the island States are among the\r\nvery top contributors.\r\nThe vulnerability of small islands to natural disasters\r\nand to fluctuations in the world economy make it difficult to\r\nquantify the well-being of our people. Calculations of per -\r\ncapita gross domestic product and other traditional economic\r\nindices do not accurately represent the standard of living in\r\nthe islands. Perhaps other criteria could be devised to reflect\r\nthe complexities of our situation.\r\nThe Marshall Islands was one of the first countries to\r\nratify the Conventions adopted at the Rio Conference on the\r\nenvironment. Developments subsequent to the Rio summit\r\nhave been closely observed by the Marshall Islands\r\nGovernment. It is our sincere hope that the process initiated\r\nat Rio de Janeiro will succeed, so that our islands can be\r\nsaved from possible destruction by global climate change.\r\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States will increase world-wide\r\nunderstanding of the vulnerability of our islands. The\r\nGovernment of Barbados is to be thanked for generously\r\noffering to host that Conference next year. We are,\r\nhowever, a little disturbed by the response by some donor\r\ncountries to the Conference. It must be reiterated that the\r\nConference has its mandate from Rio and from the forty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly, and that it should\r\nbe considered as a test case for sustainable development. It\r\nwill be an attempt to address issues that are specific to small\r\nisland States in their quest for sustainable development. The\r\nwill of the global community to live up to the promises\r\nmade in Rio will face its first test, and the implications of\r\nthe outcome of the Conference will be significant to all.\r\nThroughout history the sea has united my people and\r\nhas been vital to our lives. It provides our nourishment; it\r\nis a source of income; and our culture and traditions have in\r\nlarge part been shaped by the ocean. The majority of our\r\npopulation derives its livelihood from ocean-based activities,\r\nand our territorial waters abound with fish that can feed\r\npeople around the world. Clearly, our fate is tied to the\r\nocean. Today, however, our way of life is threatened by a\r\nrise in the level of the very ocean that has given us life for\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthousands of years. We are greatly appreciative of the\r\nefforts and attention given to the problem by the world\r\ncommunity, most notably in the Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change, signed at the Rio Earth Summit, which my\r\nGovernment is proud to have ratified.\r\nHowever, for a low-lying atoll like the Marshall Islands\r\nthe Framework Convention may have come too late. We are\r\neager that funds from all sectors of the United Nations\r\nsystem, especially the Global Environment Facility, be made\r\navailable for the purpose of adaptation to a rise in the sea\r\nlevel. We also realize fully that changes required of\r\nresidents of industrialized countries will entail considerable\r\nsacrifice, at least initially. However, countless studies have\r\nshown that steps to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions would\r\ngreatly benefit those countries in the future.\r\nThe threat to the Marshall Islands is imminent. Our\r\nway of life is threatened. My country is threatened with a\r\nloss of identity and culture. We are powerless in the hands\r\nof others and my country may cease to exist as a result.\r\nI would like everyone in this Hall to visit our corner of\r\nthe world before it disappears. I hope that 30 years from\r\ntoday our islands will not have been swamped by the sea\r\nand that we will be able to invite you again, rather than\r\nreferring you to a page in a history book. For many, the\r\nMarshall Islands may be little more than specks on the map.\r\nThe peoples of the Pacific hold a very different view of the\r\nworld: that the world would be greatly diminished by the\r\nloss of even one of the diverse cultures that have been\r\ncrafted by mankind.\r\nLet us strive during the coming months to work in\r\ntandem and to endeavour to fulfil the grand aspirations and\r\nlofty goals that this Organization represents. As we do this,\r\nallow me to offer a Marshallese proverb to guide our work:\r\n\"Jouj eo mour eo, lej eo mij eo\" - \"Alone we cannot survive,\r\nbut together we are strong\".\r\nMr. AL-KHALIFA (Bahrain) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): At the outset, I take pleasure, Sir, in congratulating\r\nyou sincerely, on behalf of the delegation of the State of\r\nBahrain’s delegation, on your election as President of the\r\nAssembly at this session. As you assume your important\r\ntask, it is my pleasure also to wish you success in carrying\r\nout your duties and to assure you of my delegation’s full\r\ncooperation with you in making the work of this session a\r\nsuccess.\r\nI take this opportunity to convey thanks and\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who\r\nconducted the proceedings of the last session with skill and\r\nefficiency.\r\nIt is also my pleasure to mention with great\r\nappreciation the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to further the\r\nobjectives of the United Nations and his tireless drive to\r\nenhance the Organization’s role in maintaining international\r\npeace and security.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend our\r\nwarmest congratulations to the delegations of the Slovak\r\nRepublic, the Czech Republic, the Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Eritrea, the Principality of Monaco\r\nand the Principality of Andorra on their accession to the\r\nmembership of the United Nations.\r\nBecause of the important issues on our agenda, this\r\nsession of the General Assembly is a significant one indeed.\r\nThese issues under consideration demand close attention, if\r\nwe are to benefit from the object lessons of the past in\r\nformulating future parameters, as is required by the\r\never-accelerating changes in the international arena. As we\r\nlook at the historical events, that have followed upon one\r\nanother, we find that the world is in the midst of a\r\nqualitative transformation that is virtually unprecedented. If\r\nwe examine the causes and aspects of that transformation,\r\nwe shall find that the conflict that raged between the eastern\r\nand the western blocs was no mere ideological dispute\r\narticulated in academic forums. Rather, it was a violent\r\npolitical type of rivalry that escalated into grave military\r\nconfrontations that were, at times, direct and at others,\r\nindirect, between the super-Powers. The past few years,\r\nhowever, have witnessed the end of that conflict, and this in\r\nturn has entailed major changes in the political outlook of\r\nvarious world Powers.\r\nIt is regrettable indeed that, in the midst of these\r\nchanges, new problems have surfaced and have thus\r\nstrengthened our conviction that the ending of the cold war\r\nwill not make the world a more secure and stable place. For\r\nall its conflicts and tensions the cold war, when it ended,\r\ncontrary to all expectations has brought to the surface the\r\nbanes of extreme nationalism and such aberrations as \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\", things which had been dormant in Eastern\r\nEurope and Central Asia.\r\nThis has led, in certain regions, to acts of violence that\r\nthreaten to change the very nature of relations between\r\nStates at a time when the path of international politics has\r\nbecome really bumpy as a result of the restructuring of the\r\nworld order. This is a time of profound change in the lives\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 5\r\nof States and nations in which people’s aspirations after\r\nstability and development merge with the fears generated by\r\nthe gap between a developed, affluent world and a world\r\nthat is unable to meet the minimum requirements of decent\r\nliving.\r\nThe major transformations that are taking place today,\r\nin the areas of politics, technology and information,\r\nunderscore the fact that our world has become a truly global\r\nvillage and that the scientific revolution is about to bring\r\ndown the barriers and boundaries between its various\r\ncountries and regions. It is regrettable indeed, at such a\r\njuncture, that while we stand on the threshold of a new\r\ncentury of man’s history, we perceive that the interests of\r\nhumanity lag behind the advances made by science and\r\ntechnology. It is paradoxical indeed that the increased\r\ninterdependence dictated by the developments that are taking\r\nplace at the present time should go hand in hand with\r\npolitical fragmentation and clash of interests as individual\r\nStates pursue their own narrow interests and ambitions.\r\nSuch a situation should urge us to look at what is going\r\non around us with a large magnifying glass so that we may\r\nbe able to fathom the depths of international problems and\r\nscrutinize their interlocking strands on the wider screen of\r\nthe global scene. If we take the measure of the rapid\r\nchanges in the international arena, we may be able to foresee\r\nthe enormity of the dangers that the future may bring and\r\nthe extent of the harm to peoples’ security and stability that\r\nmay result therefrom. For, in a world whose spaces and\r\ndistances have shrunk and whose different parts have come\r\ncloser together more than at any other time before, peace\r\ncannot be achieved in one region while the peace of another\r\nregion is left at the mercy of tensions. It is therefore\r\nincumbent upon us all to develop a practical strategy for the\r\nfuture through a new outlook that would be capable of\r\ngrasping and understanding the nature and drift of the\r\nchanges and harnessing them in the service of humanity as\r\na whole and for the strengthening of security throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nAfter this introduction, which reflects the way we see\r\nthe past and look at the present, my delegation should like\r\nto share with you certain thoughts on the building of the\r\npost-cold-war world:\r\nFirstly: there should be agreement on new concepts\r\nconcerning the issues of world peace and development\r\nthat would rid the world of the residues and perceptions\r\nof the ideological and strategic thinking that prevailed\r\nthroughout the cold-war period;\r\nSecondly: appropriate criteria should be defined for the\r\nachievement of world stability through the common\r\nsecurity of all States;\r\nThirdly: existing and traditional boundaries between\r\nStates should be respected, and all boundary disputes\r\nshould be resolved by peaceful means that are agreed\r\nupon by the parties concerned; and\r\nFourthly: there should be support for the United\r\nNations, as the appropriate international tool for the\r\nestablishment of a new international order where\r\njustice, equality, respect for international resolutions\r\nand the abandonment of double standards prevail.\r\nWar and peace are inseparable opposites. Given this\r\nperspective, the most difficult task in international politics is\r\nto devise an effective machinery to prevent the causes of\r\nwar on the one hand, and to preserve, maintain or keep the\r\npeace, on the other. It is our conviction that current\r\ninternational developments have created favourable\r\nconditions for making use of the United Nations potential to\r\ncreate a political climate that would be favourable for\r\ndeveloping the foundations of a collective security system.\r\nHere it should be pointed out that one of the most\r\nimportant means suggested for promoting collective security\r\nis the use of preventive diplomacy to prevent disputes from\r\narising between parties and to prevent existing disputes from\r\nescalating, and the development of preventive deployment of\r\nUnited Nations forces in such a way as to allow those forces\r\nto defuse potential tensions in any region of the world. We\r\nhope that Member States will reach a consensus on the\r\nformation of such forces, and that cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations can be enhanced\r\nso that the regional organizations’ experience and their\r\nhuman and material resources in the field of peace-keeping\r\ncan be tapped.\r\nIn this context, I applaud the current cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the League of Arab States\r\nand emphasize the importance of enhancing and\r\nstrengthening the existing relations between the two\r\norganizations in all fields.\r\nThe United Nations now approaches its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. The peoples of the world, with their hopes and\r\naspirations, continue to look to the Organization to lead the\r\nway to the turning of a new leaf in the history of\r\ninternational relations so that they can finally enjoy the\r\nsecurity, peace and stability for which they have long\r\nyearned.\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe world Organization has managed, since its\r\nbeginnings, to achieve some of the purposes of the Charter,\r\nbut has failed to achieve others. It is now at a juncture\r\nwhere new hopes, accompanied by new problems, have\r\narisen. Over the last five decades, the membership of the\r\nOrganization has risen from 51 States in 1954 to 184 in\r\n1993. This calls for restructuring the Organization’s\r\nprincipal organs, especially the Secretariat and the Security\r\nCouncil. We welcome the Secretary-General’s statement, in\r\nhis Agenda for Peace, that important steps have been taken\r\nto reorganize the Secretariat in order to avoid duplication\r\nand overlapping of functions and to enhance its\r\neffectiveness. We call for further reforms to be effected,\r\nmethodically, so that the Secretariat can perform its duties to\r\nthe optimum.\r\nAs for the Security Council and its role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\r\ndevelopment of this important organ and the review of the\r\nprovisions relating to its membership have recently been the\r\nobject of world attention. Consequently, the General\r\nAssembly has included in the agenda of its forty-eighth\r\nsession an item entitled \"Question of equitable representation\r\non and increase in the membership of the Security Council\".\r\nThe inclusion of this item has taken place in response\r\nto the desire of many States to emphasize the importance of\r\nadequate and equitable representation in the membership of\r\nthis important organ in line with the increase in the\r\nmembership of the Organization and the glaring disparity\r\nbetween the composition of the Council and the membership\r\nof the United Nations. From 20 per cent in 1945, the\r\nproportion has dropped to 8 per cent now. We support the\r\ncall for a review of the composition of the Security Council\r\nthat would ensure equitable geographical representation.\r\nI should like, in this connection, to refer to the\r\nresolution adopted by the Arab League Council at its regular\r\nsession, held in Cairo from 19 through 21 September 1993,\r\nwhich calls upon the United Nations to take due\r\nconsideration of the need for equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation and to establish a permanent seat on the\r\nSecurity Council for the Arab Group.\r\nWe should like to stress that it is vitally important to\r\nensure that in adopting any of the proposed formulas for\r\nincreasing the membership of the Security Council, care\r\nmust be taken that this should not lead to impeding the\r\nproper functioning by the Council in carrying out its duties,\r\nand that the power of veto should not be used as a means of\r\nundermining the decision-making process or of diluting the\r\nurgent nature of critical issues, especially those which have\r\nto do with peace and security.\r\nIn recent weeks, a ray of hope that augurs well for the\r\nfuture of world peace has appeared on the horizon of the\r\nMiddle East and the world at large: namely, the accord\r\nsigned by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and\r\nIsrael. We have consistently encouraged any sign of\r\nmovement towards a peaceful, just and comprehensive\r\nsettlement of the Palestine question. There is firm hope\r\ntoday that this step will be a precursor to a real opening for\r\npeace and stability in the Middle East region.\r\nWhile we welcome this significant and historic step, we\r\nview it as a first step on the road to a just, lasting and\r\ncomprehensive solution to the Palestine question and the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict, based on Security Council resolutions\r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other resolutions of\r\ninternational legality as well as the land-for-peace principle.\r\nWe hope that efforts will continue to be made towards the\r\nspeedy implementation of the provisions of the accord and\r\nthat the negotiations between other Arab parties and Israel\r\nwill make progress on the other tracks so that the existing\r\nopportunities for peace may be put to good use.\r\nWe look forward to the day when the Israeli forces will\r\nwithdraw from the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, including\r\nHoly Jerusalem, the occupied Syrian Golan Heights and the\r\noccupied Lebanese and Jordanian territories, and to the day\r\nwhen the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people,\r\nincluding the right of return for the Palestinian refugees, will\r\nbe guaranteed, in consonance with relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions.\r\nIt should be emphasized that stability in the Middle\r\nEast is fully dependent on its being freed from chemical,\r\nbiological and nuclear weapons. Declaring the Middle East\r\na region free of weapons of mass destruction would enable\r\nits States to focus their attention on questions of economic,\r\nscientific and technological development and would\r\nencourage them to cooperate in the field of peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy and to make a constructive contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of world peace.\r\nTwo devastating wars have swept over the Gulf, and\r\ntheir consequences have adversely affected development in\r\nthe area. It behooves us, therefore, to intensify efforts to\r\nkeep that important area free of any further tensions, through\r\nthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means and through\r\nrespect for the principles of territorial integrity and political\r\nindependence, the sovereignty of States over their own\r\nresources, non-interference in the internal affairs of other\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 7\r\nStates and strict observance of the norms of international\r\nlegality.\r\nWe should like to emphasize the need for Iraq to\r\nimplement Security Council resolutions relevant to its\r\naggression against the State of Kuwait, and in particular the\r\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 687 (1991)\r\nrelating, inter alia, to the release of Kuwaiti and other\r\nprisoners of war and detainees, and to recognize the\r\ninternational boundaries between Kuwait and Iraq as\r\ndemarcated and set out in Security Council resolution\r\n833 (1993).\r\nWe also hope that the dialogue between the United\r\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran will lead to\r\nthe settlement of all outstanding questions regarding the\r\nthree islands of Abu Mousa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb\r\nin a manner that would guarantee the rights of the United\r\nArab Emirates as set out in the resolutions of the Gulf States\r\nCooperation Council.\r\nThe international arena has witnessed some\r\ndevelopment, this year, in relation to the situation in\r\nSomalia. Although that situation continues to irk the\r\nconscience of the international community, the United\r\nNations has been able, through the efforts of a large number\r\nof its members, to restore peace in most parts of Somalia.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 814 (1993) has had a positive\r\neffect in improving the situation after the drawn out\r\nsuffering experienced by the people of that country. We\r\nshould like to voice support for United Nations efforts to\r\nrebuild the political, economic and social infrastructure of\r\nSomalia. We hope that the Somali people will be able to\r\nreach comprehensive national reconciliation between the\r\nvarious factions.\r\nThe world has been following the tragic situation in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Despite all the efforts deployed in\r\nan attempt to contain the conflict, we see no glimmer of\r\nhope that aggression against that country will cease. The\r\nSerbian side rejected the Vance-Owen peace plan, while the\r\nGovernment of Bosnia-Herzegovina accepted it. Massacres\r\nand acts of aggression against Bosnian cities continue\r\nunabated, and the Serb forces have committed the most\r\natrocious crimes of genocide and \"ethnic cleansing\" in open\r\ndefiance of the international community. Yet the Security\r\nCouncil has not taken any effective measure to suppress the\r\naggression or to enable the legitimate Bosnian Government\r\nto defend itself. That, surely, sends the wrong message to\r\nall those who do not believe in the system of international\r\ncollective security and could give rise to a surge of violence\r\nand extremism that would have an adverse effect on the\r\nUnited Nations endeavours to contain existing and potential\r\nconflicts in the world.\r\nThe international community is duty-bound to move\r\nurgently to stop the aggression against the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, to safeguard the legitimate rights\r\nof its people, to force the aggressors to comply with the\r\nprinciples of international legality, to prevent any\r\ndemographic change or any territorial gains through the\r\npolicy of fait accompli pursued by the Serbs and the Croats,\r\nand to enable the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to\r\nexercise the right of self-defence by lifting the embargo on\r\narms supplies to it.\r\nIt is regrettable, at a time when the features of a new\r\nworld order are beginning to take shape, that Central Asia\r\nshould be in the grip of a situation of instability that\r\nthreatens to tear it apart. Internal strife continues without let\r\nup in Tajikistan and Georgia and the war between Armenia\r\nand Azerbaijan has grown even more vicious. In this\r\nconnection, my delegation supports Security Council\r\nresolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993), which reaffirm the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and of all\r\nother States in the region and the inadmissibility of the use\r\nof force for the acquisition of territory. We reaffirm our\r\nendorsement of the efforts made by the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations to restore stability in that region.\r\nFor years, the Cyprus problem has continued to defy\r\nsolution. We are encouraged, however, by the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General to bring the two Cypriot parties closer to\r\nagreement. Despite the remaining obstacles that obstruct the\r\nsettlement of this problem, it is our view that the good\r\noffices of the Secretary-General should continue until a\r\nsolution that would be satisfactory to both parties may be\r\nreached.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Cambodia, positive\r\nresults have been achieved, and the United Nations, through\r\nthe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia\r\n(UNTAC), has been able to restore political stability to that\r\ncountry. We should like on this occasion to extend our\r\nsincere congratulations to the people and Government of\r\nCambodia on the outcome of their efforts in pursuit of\r\nnational reconciliation and peace. We also commend the\r\nconstructive efforts of UNTAC in carrying out its mandate\r\nin Cambodia.\r\nSouth Africa is now going through a significant and\r\ncrucial phase in its march towards political reform. The\r\nmain features of this reform are the agreement on the\r\ndrafting of a new constitution, the formation of a new\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ntransitional multi-party Government, and the agreement to\r\nhold constitutional elections in April 1994. These\r\ndevelopments demonstrate the sincere desire of all parties in\r\nSouth Africa to turn a new leaf in their relations. We\r\nsupport the reforms currently under way in South Africa and\r\nwelcome Nelson Mandela’s call, in his recent address at the\r\nUnited Nations, for lifting the economic sanctions now in\r\nplace against South Africa.\r\nAlthough the fires of the cold war have been put out\r\nand have become something of the past, we cannot but voice\r\nour concern over the numerous difficulties which continue\r\nto beset the world economy. The gap is still wide between\r\nthe average per capita income in developing countries and\r\nthat in developed countries. In 1992, that figure was over\r\n$18,000 in the developed countries, while in the developing\r\ncountries it did not exceed $800. There are distressing\r\nindications that the rate of world economic growth lags\r\nbehind the rate of world population growth.\r\nThe continuing social deterioration and lack of\r\neconomic security which result from continuous political\r\nupheavals will undoubtedly impede economic development\r\nin the long term. So long as the world economy continues\r\nto stagnate, the urgent social problems connected with the\r\neconomy, in the areas of population, health, housing and\r\nenvironment, will continue to defy solution.\r\nAny change in the world economy, whether it be\r\nnegative or positive, affects every State. The world\r\neconomy stands in need of the political will that should lead\r\nall the States of the world, especially the developed\r\ncountries, to cooperate in solving those problems that face us\r\nall. This makes it incumbent upon us all to strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations, as the Organization that has\r\ncontinued for about half a century, to embrace the countries\r\nof the world with the distinctive and varied experiences each\r\nand every country has gained in the areas of developmental\r\ncoordination and cooperation.\r\nOver the past decades, the world has been focusing on\r\neconomic development owing to the immediate and speedy\r\nreturns it generates for the world economy. Voices have\r\nbeen raised in the United Nations, in recent years, urging\r\nthat attention should be paid to social development as well.\r\nThis has led to the adoption by the General Assembly of\r\nresolution 47/92, in which it decided to convene a World\r\nSummit for Social Development early in 1995. We hope\r\nthat those in charge of preparations for that conference will\r\nreach agreement to further those objectives of the Charter set\r\nout in Article 55, relating to the promotion of higher\r\nstandards of living, conditions of economic and social\r\nprogress and development as well as to the resolution of\r\ninternational economic and social problems.\r\nOur planet faces man-made environmental threats\r\nwhose consequences are unpredictable. The Earth Summit\r\nin Rio de Janeiro was an important step towards world\r\npartnership in combating those environmental threats. We\r\nshould like, in this context, to reiterate our support for the\r\nefforts to contain the threats to our environment, and we\r\nhope that the programmes adopted by the Rio Summit,\r\nespecially those included in Agenda 21, will be\r\nimplemented.\r\nThe attention focused on population problems stems\r\nfrom the tremendous density of population in some countries\r\nand the adverse effects that density has on development. We\r\nwelcome the efforts by the United Nations and particularly\r\nby the United Nations Population Fund, to address such\r\nissues. We hope that the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development scheduled to be held in Cairo\r\nnext year, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 47/176,\r\nwill adopt recommendations that may ensure the resolution\r\nof urgent population and development problems in the next\r\ndecade.\r\nSeveral years have passed since the world first\r\nwitnessed that novel, unique situation in the history of\r\ninternational relations, namely the ending of bipolarity. The\r\nresult of this is that the world now stands at the crossroads\r\nof history, where it faces difficult challenges. This is\r\nespecially so because certain evil tendencies have caused the\r\neruption of volcanoes of malevolent hatreds and racism,\r\nwhich have destroyed many hopes and shattered the\r\nexpectations of millions of people to achieve security and\r\nprosperity for future generations.\r\nIt may be appropriate to stop here and wonder whether\r\nthe United Nations has done all it should to address the\r\nproblems that have surfaced due to this major transformation\r\nin world order? Has the machinery which we and many\r\nothers have called for been made available to the world\r\nOrganization to enable it to fulfil its role in a manner that is\r\ncompatible with the developments of our time? Even if the\r\nUnited Nations has moved as we had hoped, have the\r\nMember States made available to it the material and moral\r\nresources to enable it to take effective action to address all\r\nof the world problems, wherever they may appear?\r\nWe do not believe anyone in today’s world searches for\r\nthe Utopia described in Plato’s Republic or Farabi’s Ideal\r\nCity. Yet everyone would like to see the United Nations\r\nmade able to achieve practical solutions for world problems.\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 9\r\nFor it is our conviction that any blood shed by a hand\r\nprompted by an ethnic bigotry or racial hatred would be a\r\nclear indication of our failure to respond to the aspirations\r\nof all our peoples.\r\nIt is in this context that we call for resorting to reason\r\nin trying to understand the new phenomena and to deal with\r\npolitical, economic and social problems in a rational and\r\ndispassionate manner. The time has come for issues relating\r\nto international and regional security and development to be\r\nput in their proper realistic perspectives, without any\r\nidealistic flights of fancy. Such problems should be dealt\r\nwith in the light of the objective realities of the world we\r\nlive in with all its successive developments, so that the\r\nsolutions devised for them may be applicable in the current\r\natmosphere of inter-State rivalries. We are confident that,\r\nwith political will, material support and moral\r\nencouragement, it will be possible for the United Nations to\r\nperform its role in steering the ship of hope towards the\r\nshores of security and peace we all seek.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. CHUAN LEEKPAI, PRIME\r\nMINISTER OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nThailand.\r\nMr. Chuan Leekpai, Prime Minister of the Kingdom\r\nof Thailand, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Chuan Leekpai, and inviting him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. LEEKPAI (Thailand): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Thailand, may I extend my\r\nwarmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nI am confident that you will provide the Assembly with the\r\nnecessary leadership and direction in this period of systemic\r\nchange in the international order.\r\nI also wish to congratulate Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\r\nBulgaria for having guided the forty-seventh session of the\r\nAssembly to a successful conclusion.\r\nAllow me also to express our admiration to and support\r\nfor Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his untiring\r\nefforts in guiding the United Nations through this period,\r\nwhen the Organization is being called upon to undertake\r\npeace-keeping activities around the globe on a scale\r\nunprecedented in its history. I also wish to congratulate him\r\non his vision, so lucidly expressed in his report, \"An Agenda\r\nfor Peace.\" We look forward with anticipation to his\r\nforthcoming report on an agenda for development.\r\nIt is with great pleasure that we welcome, as full\r\nMembers of the United Nations, Andorra, the Czech\r\nRepublic, Eritrea, Monaco, the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, and the Slovak Republic. We sincerely believe\r\nthat these States’ assumption of their rightful places in the\r\nfamily of nations will further strengthen the universal\r\ncharacter of the United Nations.\r\nBefore proceeding further, may I, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Thailand, convey profound\r\nsympathy to and express solidarity with the Government and\r\nthe people of India following the massive destruction and\r\nloss of life that resulted from the devastating earthquake last\r\nweek.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, a new spirit of friendly\r\ncooperation prevails in South-East Asia. The international\r\nsettlement of the Cambodian problem means that, for the\r\nfirst time in recent memory, the region is free of major\r\narmed conflict. With a view to constructing a new regional\r\norder of peace, harmony and prosperity, we the countries of\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are\r\nseeking to intensify various cooperative efforts among\r\nourselves and with our neighbours and our friends outside\r\nthe region.\r\nASEAN was born in Bangkok more than 26 years ago,\r\nwhen the cold war was at its height. Now, at the end of the\r\ncold war, ASEAN has attained the political and economic\r\nstanding to play a greater role in the affairs of the region\r\nand beyond. Thailand will assume the ASEAN\r\nchairmanship this year, and it looks forward to working with\r\nall concerned, both within and outside the Association, to\r\nadvance the causes of peace and prosperity in South-East\r\nAsia.\r\nAs the ASEAN member geographically closest to the\r\nrest of South-East Asia, Thailand is in a unique position to\r\nserve as a bridge to our non-ASEAN neighbours. Thus, my\r\nGovernment wholeheartedly welcomes the accession by the\r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic to the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and\r\nCooperation, which sets the broad framework for enhanced\r\ncooperation in South-East Asia. We earnestly hope that the\r\nday is not too distant when Laos and Viet Nam, together\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nwith Cambodia, which is on the path towards rejoining the\r\ninternational community, will become full members of\r\nASEAN.\r\nIn seizing the opportunity to help to forge a new\r\nregional order of cooperative peace and common prosperity,\r\nASEAN is increasingly appreciative of the function of\r\nmultilateral diplomacy - particularly the enhanced\r\ncooperation between ASEAN and the United Nations.\r\nFor well over a decade, Cambodia has commanded the\r\nattention of the world. ASEAN and the United Nations have\r\nbeen working closely with each other to secure a durable\r\npolitical settlement of the Cambodian problem. In\r\nCambodia, the United Nations has just undertaken one of the\r\nmost comprehensive peace-keeping operations in its history.\r\nThe Organization - essentially through the United Nations\r\nTransition Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) - must be\r\ncongratulated for organizing the massive repatriation of\r\nCambodian refugees from neighbouring Thailand and the\r\ncrucial elections that resulted in the creation of a\r\ndemocratically elected majority Government in Cambodia,\r\nthus enhancing the prospect of national reconciliation. I\r\nshould like to express my Government’s appreciation to Mr.\r\nYasushi Akashi, to his colleagues and to the men and\r\nwomen of UNTAC for successfully fulfilling their mission\r\nof helping to restore peace to Cambodia. Above all, our\r\nwarmest congratulations go to the courageous Cambodian\r\npeople themselves and, in particular, to His Majesty\r\nSamdech Norodom Sihanouk for his vital role in the\r\nrestoration of the Cambodian nation.\r\nBesides facilitating the return of more than 300,000\r\nCambodians to their homeland, Thailand had cooperated\r\nwith the United Nations from the outset. We participated in\r\nthe mine-clearing and road-building operations in western\r\nCambodia, and, as I speak, Thailand is working closely with\r\nUNTAC in implementing the withdrawal of the remaining\r\nUNTAC personnel. Thailand will continue to participate in\r\nthe international community’s efforts to rehabilitate\r\nCambodia. To this end, we welcome the success of the\r\nInternational Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia\r\nthat was held in Paris in September this year. With the\r\nreturn of peace and normality to Cambodia, we are confident\r\nthat the country will resume its rightful place in the South-\r\nEast Asian family of nations. Thailand pledges its friendship\r\nand cooperation to the newly elected Government of\r\nCambodia as it embarks on the path of nation-building.\r\nIn the post-cold-war world, the changing concept of\r\nsecurity provides further impetus for the regional role of the\r\nUnited Nations. In the present era, security is defined in far\r\nbroader terms than in the past. In particular, the\r\nnon-military aspect of security has assumed greater urgency\r\nthan, and now takes precedence over, its military dimension.\r\nIt is now seen more as a confidence-building process than as\r\na process of either defence or deterrence. Activities to\r\n\"reassure\" other parties, political dialogue and similar\r\narrangements to engender and enhance mutual understanding,\r\nmutually beneficial collaborative efforts to solve common\r\nproblems, crisis-management mechanisms and other\r\npreventive measures could all be subsumed under the\r\nheading of security.\r\nSuch a concept of security, particularly at the regional\r\nlevel, fits in well with the preventive-diplomacy approach.\r\nThis is one area in which there is potential for the United\r\nNations to define its role as being to strengthen and facilitate\r\nregional cooperation and understanding.\r\nNaturally, all efforts in this regard must be undertaken\r\nwithin a multilateral framework. The collaborative agenda\r\nfor preventive diplomacy would include conflict forecasting,\r\nconflict avoidance or prevention, conflict management, and\r\nthe prevention of conflict escalation. In this regard, my\r\nGovernment welcomes the Secretary-General’s excellent and\r\ncomprehensive report \"An Agenda for Peace\", which\r\nrepresents new thinking and an innovative approach to\r\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations. Moreover, my\r\nGovernment is heartened by the enthusiasm that Member\r\nStates have shown for the report. Our next step must be full\r\nand speedy implementation of the recommendations put\r\nforward in the report, as well as those contained in various\r\nSecurity Council documents and in General Assembly\r\nresolution 47/120, which was adopted at the last session.\r\nA mature and self-confident ASEAN is in a singular\r\nposition to enhance the role and effectiveness of the United\r\nNations in South-East Asia - particularly in the areas of\r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and\r\npeace-building. In the aftermath of the cold war, the success\r\nof the United Nations depends very much on close\r\ncooperation with countries in target regions. Put simply, the\r\nUnited Nations needs all the help it can get. Regional\r\norganizations can help to identify potential conflicts and,\r\ntogether with the United Nations, contain them before they\r\nerupt. Cooperation between the United Nations and a\r\nregional organization with a solid track record - such as\r\nASEAN - can compensate for the weaknesses of any\r\norganization acting singly.\r\nTo explore how best the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) could act in accordance with the\r\nrecommendations contained in \"An Agenda for Peace\",\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 11\r\nThailand has initiated and organized, in collaboration with\r\nour ASEAN partner Singapore, a series of international\r\nworkshops on ASEAN-United Nations cooperation for peace\r\nand preventive diplomacy.\r\nThe rationale behind this initiative is simple enough.\r\nThe threat to international peace, actual or potential, often\r\narises out of a certain specific region. With cold-war\r\nconstraints on United Nations regional intervention removed,\r\nthe Organization is in an ideal position to cooperate with\r\nASEAN to ensure peace and stability in South-East Asia.\r\nThe foundation for such cooperation already exists.\r\nThe ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-East\r\nAsia forms the basis for a new code of conduct in the region\r\nand was endorsed by the forty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nOther factors may also favour United Nations\r\npreventive diplomacy in South-East Asia. One of these is\r\nthe regional presence of the major Powers. Under certain\r\ncircumstances, the United Nations provides a framework for\r\naction by major Powers. A case in point is Japan’s\r\npeace-keeping role in the region under the United Nations\r\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia. Arrangements could\r\nthus be made for these nations to play a \"legitimate\"\r\ncrisis-prevention role involving, for example, political\r\ndialogue and mediation. Similarly, the regional economic\r\ndevelopment imperative may add impetus to United Nations\r\nregional involvement. The Organization has long been in\r\nplace in South-East Asia in this regard. Its development\r\ncommitments to and development efforts in the region have\r\nbeen evident in the location there of various United Nations\r\nregional bodies.\r\nThe next step will be to work out specific functional\r\narrangements for ASEAN-United Nations cooperation. It is\r\nanticipated that the third and final workshop, to be held in\r\nBangkok in January 1994, will come up with suggestions on\r\nappropriate mechanisms for fostering the conditions for\r\nregional peace and prosperity through closer cooperation\r\nbetween ASEAN and the United Nations.\r\nThe improved outlook for greater economic cooperation\r\nin the region is manifest in the enthusiasm for economic\r\nnetworking. Within ASEAN we have set up the ASEAN\r\nFree Trade Area (AFTA) to intensify intra-ASEAN\r\neconomic cooperation and attract outside investment. The\r\ncountries of South-East Asia are taking up the challenge of\r\nforging economic linkages through various schemes known\r\nas \"growth triangles\", \"growth quadrangles\" and \"special\r\neconomic zones\". These linkages will help further promote\r\nthe spirit of friendship and cooperation and serve to provide\r\na nucleus for greater interaction with other parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nA livable world is a world in which governmental\r\ndevelopment strategies can be implemented in a favourable\r\ninternational environment. The international economy must\r\nprovide a supportive climate for achieving environment and\r\ndevelopment goals. Among others, we must further pursue\r\nthe liberalization of global trade policies, promote the\r\nefficient allocation of the world’s resources, make trade and\r\nenvironment mutually compatible, and provide adequate\r\nfinancial and technical resources to developing countries.\r\nThese measures are prerequisites for creating a more\r\nprosperous world, where countries share their wealth in a\r\nliberal trading system and where fair competition is\r\nguaranteed by broadly accepted rules. For this reason, my\r\nGovernment believes that an early and successful conclusion\r\nof the Uruguay Round is imperative to revitalizing world\r\ntrade. Thailand joins our ASEAN partners in welcoming the\r\nrenewed determination and commitment of the industrialized\r\ncountries at the recent Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo to\r\nresolve remaining problems and to conclude the Round by\r\nthe end of this year.\r\nBalanced world development is not only an enlightened\r\naim, it is the foundation for the enduring progress of all\r\nsocieties. And this should be the basis for reactivating\r\nNorth-South cooperation. It should mark a new beginning\r\nin international development cooperation based on the\r\nprinciple of the Cartagena commitments. It must go beyond\r\naid to embrace partnership and reciprocal responsibilities. It\r\nmust address global and regional concerns by meeting local\r\nneeds.\r\nThe global consensus reached at the Earth Summit in\r\nRio de Janeiro last year has equipped us to take collective\r\naction to meet new priorities. We have built the consensus\r\nto pursue development which goes beyond economic growth.\r\nIt is development in a comprehensive sense, guided by\r\nprinciples of equality and justice, and underpinned by social\r\nand ecological responsibility. As we, the leaders, proclaim\r\nchange, we must demonstrate our political conviction\r\nthrough national policies that are in line with the\r\ninternational consensus.\r\nMy Government is fully committed to the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED) agreement. Our\r\nnational development plan for 1992 to 1996 reflects our\r\ndetermination to achieve sustainable development. My\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nGovernment has taken various necessary administrative and\r\nlegal steps to integrate the environment with development\r\nand to implement the programme of action as reflected in\r\nAgenda 21.\r\nAs my Government is the first elected Government\r\nfollowing the May incident of 1992, we are more keenly\r\naware of the intimate links between democracy,\r\ndevelopment, and human rights. Hence, democratization\r\nmust be accompanied by sustained efforts to further the\r\ncause of human dignity and freedom.\r\nForty-five years ago, Thailand joined the international\r\ncommunity in adopting the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. Since then, the international community has\r\nachieved a number of positive results in the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights.\r\nFrom the time of the first International Conference on\r\nHuman Rights in Teheran in 1968, the international\r\ncommunity has assumed new responsibilities not only to\r\nprotect but also to promote human rights. The time has\r\ncome to work on the prevention of human rights abuses.\r\nLast June, the World Conference on Human Rights in\r\nVienna concluded with a consensus document. The Vienna\r\nDeclaration brings together views on fundamental rights, and\r\nserves as a universal basis from which the international\r\ncommunity will proceed. Thailand reaffirms its commitment\r\nto and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\nas set out in the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action.\r\nThe task before us now is to implement the\r\nrecommendations of the Conference. In this regard, the\r\nUnited Nations has a central role to play. The Organization,\r\nwith the collective efforts of its Member States, must\r\nstrengthen the mechanisms for allocating sufficient human\r\nand financial resources to carry out the activities required of\r\nit.\r\nBefore I conclude, may I emphasize that Thailand has\r\nbeen fortunate enough to have the benefit of the guidance\r\nand wisdom of their Majesties the King and Queen in all\r\nspheres of national life. Indeed, our monarchy has been the\r\nsymbol of national unity, a beacon of hope and the ultimate\r\nsource of strength in the hearts of all Thai people.\r\nMr. President, let me conclude my statement by\r\nwishing you every success in your new responsibilities. You\r\nhave a long and important session of the General Assembly\r\nahead of you. I have no doubt that you will fulfil your\r\nresponsibilities with great dignity and distinction.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Thailand for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Chuan Leekpai, Prime Minister of the Kingdom\r\nof Thailand, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nMr. ZIELENIEC (Czech Republic): Mr. President, let\r\nme start by congratulating you on your election to this high\r\noffice. I am sure that under your leadership this year’s\r\nGeneral Assembly will be particularly successful and\r\neffective.\r\nToday is the first time that a representative of the\r\nCzech Republic has had the honour to address the United\r\nNations General Assembly as part of the general debate.\r\nThe Czech Republic is indeed a new State. Still, the\r\ndivision of Czechoslovakia is nothing to be happy about. It\r\nis always better for equal communities to unite than to\r\nseparate. However, once we determined that the continued\r\nexistence of Czechoslovakia could not be assured by quiet\r\nand peaceful means, we strove to separate peacefully. While\r\nin other parts of the world similar separations are frequently\r\naccompanied by terror and violence, in our country not a\r\nsingle window pane was broken. This experience makes us\r\nbelieve that good will and common sense can lead to\r\npeaceful settlements, even of problems traditionally\r\naccompanied by violence.\r\nThe Czech Republic is currently undergoing profound\r\npolitical and economic changes. On the political side, we\r\nare constructing a democratic regime in what used to be the\r\ncommunist world. The Government has proven to be a\r\nstable one. Meanwhile, we emphasize human rights, and our\r\nrobust press freedom as well as our human-rights record\r\nhave been recognized even by very finicky non-partisan\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nOn the economic side, the Czech Republic has also\r\nchalked up certain successes. Privatization of property that\r\nwas formerly State-owned is continuing apace. Prices are\r\nbeing freed so that they can find their natural, market-driven\r\nlevel. Meanwhile, we have managed to maintain tight\r\nmonetary policies, keep inflation and unemployment at rather\r\nmodest levels, and hold to a balanced budget. We live\r\nwithin our means.\r\nIn this context, let me emphasize one thing. We are\r\nmanaging the process of economic transformation with our\r\nown efforts and our own resources. We do not ask for\r\ndirect financial assistance. We do not seek to siphon off\r\nscarce development resources from countries whose situation\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 13\r\nis much worse than ours. We tell our friends from\r\ndeveloped countries, \"We seek trade not aid from you.\r\nOpen your markets to us, not your pocketbooks.\" Actually,\r\nopen markets would benefit all of us, whether our economies\r\nare developed or developing, settled or in transition. This is\r\nwhy we are convinced that the successful conclusion of the\r\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\r\nTrade would finally benefit us all.\r\nIn addition to the transition of our domestic political\r\nsystem and the transformation of our economic system, we\r\nhave also modified our foreign policy. One of our foreign\r\npolicy priorities concerns Slovakia. Over the last months,\r\nthe Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have been\r\nlearning how to live together as two independent countries,\r\nrather than as two regions of the same country. We have\r\nconcluded a series of agreements and treaties, and have\r\nbecome used to having an international border between us -\r\na border, I stress, which is peaceful.\r\nWe are assuming our natural place in Europe. My\r\ncountry has recently been accepted as a member of the\r\nCouncil of Europe, which my President is about to address\r\nin a day or two. Just two days ago in Luxembourg I signed\r\na Europe Agreement with the European Economic\r\nCommunity. Also unmistakable is the transatlantic\r\ndimension of our diplomacy, as exemplified by our activities\r\nwithin the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE) and the North Atlantic Council for\r\nCooperation (NACC), and by our interest in joining the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\r\nOur relations with the developing world have also been\r\nchanging. On the one hand, there is a long history of\r\nfriendly relations with many countries which we are now\r\ntrying to put on a new and more balanced footing. On the\r\nother hand, we are seeking cooperation with a number of\r\nimportant countries which until recently had been ignored for\r\npolitical reasons. Thousands of physicians and technicians\r\nfrom the developing world who have been trained in our\r\nuniversities act today as so many goodwill ambassadors for\r\nus. I am sure that in a short time we will be able to provide\r\nappropriate economic assistance to needy regions of the\r\nworld, preferably through multilateral channels.\r\nOur foreign policy is that of a small country and\r\nreflects that country’s position in Europe and in the world.\r\nIt is, however, an independent foreign policy which is not\r\nbeholden to anyone and which does not blindly copy the\r\nforeign policy of any other country.\r\nThe end of the cold war era is connected with the fall\r\nof European communism, and its consequences have not yet\r\nbeen fully grasped. While the danger of a world nuclear\r\ncatastrophe has significantly abated, conflicts provoked by\r\npolitical, ethnic, religious, social and economic disputes have\r\nflared up. Meanwhile, rays of hope have appeared in\r\nregions where we perhaps did not expect them. I have in\r\nmind the prospects for a peaceful settlement in the Middle\r\nEast, the shaping of a democratic process in the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa and last, but not least, the success of the\r\nUnited Nations in Cambodia.\r\nIn recent days we have been following with great\r\nconcern developments in the Russian Federation. We had\r\nhoped that Russia’s problems would be settled peacefully,\r\nbut the anti-reformist opposition initiated violence. Free and\r\ndemocratic elections are the only solution to the situation.\r\nElections will determine whether those who waved the\r\nRussian flag in Moscow or those who waved the communist\r\nred flag should guide Russia’s future.\r\nPost-cold-war conflicts have shaken many of the values,\r\nprinciples and certainties with which we have been living.\r\nNowhere have these values been questioned as radically and\r\nas viciously as in the countries of the former Yugoslavia\r\nduring the several wars that have taken place there in recent\r\nyears. Wars in the former Yugoslavia, the Caucasus and\r\nelsewhere have made us aware of the need to ask old\r\nquestions anew, to re-examine concepts that have been basic\r\nto international politics since the Second World War.\r\nThese questions concern, for example,\r\nself-determination; the role of internal borders as new States\r\nemerge; non-interference in internal affairs; international\r\nrecognition of new States and its timing; and probably\r\nothers. We will need to scrutinize them far more daringly\r\nand rigorously and with far greater imagination. Here, I\r\nthink, is where some of the greatest challenges for the\r\nUnited Nations will arise in the immediate future. This is\r\ntreacherous ground, but it might offer one possible vehicle\r\nin the search for guidance in the times ahead.\r\nToday, however, the fighting in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina seems to be resulting in a division of that\r\ncountry along ethnic lines. We find the enforced\r\ncoincidence of statehood with ethnicity odious. We cherish\r\nthe principle of a civic society in which citizens enjoy equal\r\nrights regardless of their ethnic background, mother tongue\r\nor religious creed. By contrast, we feel that ethnic, not to\r\nmention religious, purity is a concept from another age,\r\nirrelevant in the modern world. We regard as inadmissible\r\nany violent changes of frontiers as well as \"ethnic cleansing\"\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\naccompanied by massive and flagrant violations of human\r\nrights.\r\nOne need not stress how important for my country -\r\nparticularly when it was not free - was adherence to human\r\nrights, including their codification by the United Nations.\r\nIndividual, universally valid human rights and their\r\nobservance are inseparably linked to democracy and\r\nprosperity. This year’s World Conference on Human Rights\r\nheld in Vienna was an important turning-point. In our\r\nopinion, a more effective use of the means spent on the\r\nprotection of human rights, the concentration of activities\r\ninto one body, and the establishment of the office of a high\r\ncommissioner for human rights would be steps in the right\r\ndirection.\r\nThe Czech Republic is proud of its share in the work\r\nof the United Nations. Let me mention some of our\r\ncontributions. Currently we have military observers in\r\nMozambique and in the former Yugoslavia. Two more\r\nteams are to be deployed in Georgia and in Liberia. Others\r\nhave helped keep the peace in Angola and in Somalia. We\r\nhave an infantry battalion stationed in Croatia under the\r\ncommand of the United Nations Protection Force. Our\r\ncivilian observers monitored Haiti’s elections. Our military\r\nparticipated in the liberation of Kuwait. Our specialists are\r\nworking for the United Nations Special Commission. A\r\nlarge group of security personnel is about to join the United\r\nNations guard contingent in Iraq. Our officers also served\r\nfor 40 years on the armistice line in Korea as members of\r\nthe Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.T h i s\r\ndemonstrates our tradition of service to the international\r\ncommunity, a tradition of shouldering our fair share of the\r\ninternational burden.\r\nAlong different lines, we have participated for 30 years\r\nin the work of the United Nations decolonization Committee.\r\nAnd as I look around this Hall, I realize that there is not a\r\nsingle country among the 130 or so which have been\r\nadmitted after the founding of the United Nations that we\r\nwould not have helped assume its seat here.\r\nAs members of the Assembly know, the Czech\r\nRepublic is running in elections for one of the non--\r\npermanent seats on the Security Council. We are running on\r\nour record - our record of service and the record of our\r\nexperience. On this basis I ask members for their support in\r\nthe forthcoming elections.\r\nAs many have already mentioned in the general debate,\r\nthe world is different than it was 50 years ago.\r\nConsequently, the United Nations and its Security Council\r\nhave reached a turning-point. Still, it is the considered\r\nopinion of my Government that, on the whole, the Security\r\nCouncil now serves us well. In the past few years, it has\r\nceased to be a mere side-show in world politics. Indeed, it\r\nhas frequently come to occupy centre stage. As a result, the\r\nCouncil and the United Nations as a whole are striving to\r\nmeet the rising expectations the world is pinning on them.\r\nWhatever changes we suggest, we must proceed\r\nresponsibly in efforts to reform the Council, in the spirit of\r\nmutual understanding and consensus. The Security Council\r\nmust adapt to the new political, economic, social and\r\nsecurity realities of the world. Some countries have become\r\nimportant members of the international community. An\r\nexpansion of the Security Council must above all respect\r\nprinciples of effectiveness and responsibility for\r\nimplementing its own decisions. A just geographical\r\nrepresentation is equally important.\r\nHowever, some changes should be made today. There\r\nis a certain sense of frustration among non-members of the\r\nSecurity Council, which is steadily increasing the number of\r\nits informal meetings behind closed doors. We need greater\r\ntransparency. We need more communication. We need a\r\nbetter balance between the Council and the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn this respect, distributing the monthly agenda of the\r\nSecurity Council to Members is a welcome first step.\r\nInviting the chairmen of regional groups for briefings is also\r\nhelpful. I am sure that the Council will find further\r\nmeasures along these lines that could be implemented\r\nimmediately. If the Czech Republic is elected, my\r\nPermanent Mission will try to identify other such measures.\r\nThe credibility of the United Nations hangs on, inter\r\nalia, the performance of some 80,000 military and civilian\r\nmembers of United Nations forces in 17 peace-keeping\r\noperations all over the world. Crisis management now\r\nincludes not only the classical separation of adversaries but\r\nalso the protection of humanitarian convoys, the monitoring\r\nof elections and the observance of human rights. Peace-\r\nkeepers are sent more often to countries where there are no\r\nfunctioning Governments and where agreements are worth\r\nonly the paper they are written on. Thus, Blue Helmets are\r\nincreasingly becoming the targets of uncontrolled armed\r\ngroups. Even as we hold this general debate, members of\r\npeace-keeping forces are dying in clashes with warlords.\r\nThe Czech Republic welcomes the intensifying\r\ndiscussion of the Secretary-General’s \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\". The resolution adopted at the forty-seventh session\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 15\r\nof the General Assembly is a first step, however small, in\r\nthe right direction. However, much more intensive\r\ncooperation not only among Member States but also between\r\nMember States and the United Nations Secretariat is needed\r\nin order to create an effective mechanism of functioning\r\npeace-keeping. The work of our Organization must\r\ncorrespond to the changing character of peace-keeping. One\r\ninteresting idea is the proposal to create a working group\r\nunder the auspices of the Security Council that would review\r\nthese issues and prepare proposals and recommendations.\r\nThe considerable number of regional and domestic\r\nconflicts is a part of the global security picture. Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional institutions is\r\nanother useful instrument for solving them. The Conference\r\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) is one\r\norganization that plays an important role in the Euro-Asian\r\narea. The first formal step towards cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE was resolution 47/10, adopted\r\nat the last session of the United Nations General Assembly.\r\nNot by accident, the cooperation and coordination of these\r\ntwo organizations was formalized during Czechoslovakia’s\r\npresidency of the CSCE. The limited resources of both\r\norganizations force us to try to coordinate and complement\r\ntheir operations and missions.\r\nGuided by our own vital interests, we have been\r\nstriving to develop closer cooperation and interaction with\r\norganizations capable of giving effective security guarantees.\r\nThis, however, does not mean we want passively to let\r\nothers look after our security. On the contrary, we wish to\r\nbe active participants in this two-way process. This effort\r\ninvolves, for example, the following: first, our constructive\r\ncontribution, as a country with an advanced nuclear industry,\r\ntowards the strengthening of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its extension\r\nbeyond 1995; secondly, the adoption of obligations to reduce\r\nthe risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\r\ntheir means of delivery, particularly through joining the\r\nMissile Technology Control Regime and the so-called\r\nAustralia Group; and thirdly, the early ratification and\r\nthorough implementation of the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and\r\nUse of Chemical Weapons.\r\nA financial crisis is threatening our Organization. The\r\nfinancial discipline of Member States is but one prerequisite\r\nfor improving the situation. Equally important is the need\r\nto make more effective use of available resources and to\r\nstrengthen the control of Member States in using them. We\r\nneed to make better use of existing control mechanisms. We\r\nfavour the creation of a strong, meaningful post of an\r\ninspector general.\r\nThe United Nations system also pays great attention to\r\nthe problems of social development, and a lot of good work\r\nhas been done since development programmes and\r\nspecialized agencies were established. The Czech Republic\r\nconsiders the problems of economic and social development\r\nto be one of the priorities for international policy-making, as\r\nthese issues directly influence other current burning issues,\r\nsuch as local and ethnic wars, drugs, poverty and\r\nundernourishment in some regions of the world.\r\nHowever, despite the numerous successes of specialized\r\nagencies, there is considerable space for further improvement\r\nof their performance and efficiency. We think there is room\r\nfor improvement in, inter alia, focusing more carefully on\r\nspecific targets; eliminating overlap in some activities;\r\nutilizing available resources more effectively; reducing\r\nbureaucracy and enhancing flexibility; and developing\r\ngreater cooperation among agencies.\r\nEnvironmental issues are also high on our agenda, as\r\nparts of our country are in the most environmentally\r\ndevastated areas of the world. The situation is not only\r\ntaking its toll on people’s health but is also undermining the\r\neconomy of the country as a whole. Sustainable\r\ndevelopment is more than a new-fangled catchword for us:\r\nin our country, it means finding the right balance between\r\nenvironmental concerns and aspirations of development.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment (UNCED) was an important step forward in\r\ntackling this problem in all its dimensions. All\r\nUNCED-related decisions adopted at the forty-seventh\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly are very\r\nimportant. The Czech Republic will take part in their\r\nimplementation, even if not all of them relate directly to its\r\nnational interests. We welcome the creation of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development. The mandate of\r\nthe Commission, its programme of work and the experience\r\nit has accumulated even during the short period of its\r\nexistence indicate its budding importance. The Czech\r\nRepublic, as a member of the Commission, is seriously\r\ninvolved in its work.\r\nCentral and Eastern parts of Europe border on a zone\r\nof instability. We have gained priceless experience in\r\nsolving problems resulting from the disintegration of the\r\ntotalitarian world, even as we perceive the world through the\r\neyes of a stable European democracy. This dual vision can\r\nhelp us identify risks and seek their solutions. We feel we\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nhave something to contribute, and we are prepared to\r\nshoulder our share of responsibility for world affairs. This\r\nis one of the reasons why the Czech Republic submitted its\r\ncandidacy as a non-permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil. We believe we will be able effectively to use our\r\nexperience and our perception of the world, and we hope\r\nthat you will all support us.\r\nMr. WONG (Singapore): Since PLO Chairman Yasser\r\nArafat shook hands with the Israeli Prime Minister on the\r\nWhite House lawn, nothing seems impossible any more.\r\nThe end of the cold war has opened opportunities to set\r\naside some of the most intractable, destructive and polarizing\r\nconflicts of our time.\r\nApartheid is coming to an end in South Africa. Eastern\r\nEurope is free. Russia and the other States of the former\r\nSoviet Union are shaking off the stifling effects of more than\r\n70 years of communism. Germany has been peacefully\r\nreunited.\r\nIn Asia, Cambodia is moving towards national\r\nreconciliation after almost 20 years of war. Viet Nam and\r\nLaos are reintegrating themselves into the South-East Asian\r\ncommunity.\r\nChina and Taiwan held direct informal talks in\r\nSingapore and Beijing this year. They will continue their\r\nown dialogue at their own pace. They should be encouraged\r\nto build confidence by working together, as they already\r\nhave in the Asian Development Bank and the Asia-Pacific\r\nEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC) and as they hope to\r\ndo in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\r\nChange has its own dynamic. And not all changes are\r\nbenign. The post-cold-war problems are legion and well\r\nknown. It will be a challenge for the United Nations to\r\nrespond. In recent years, there has been a marked expansion\r\nin the number and scope of the operations and activities\r\nauthorized by the Security Council.\r\nEstablished procedures, such as the Security Council-\r\nmandated Commission that has demarcated the boundary\r\nbetween Iraq and Kuwait, have made and will continue to\r\nmake positive contributions to stabilizing the post-cold-war\r\nworld, providing authoritative reference points. United\r\nNations specialized agencies, such as the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), are playing an important\r\nrole in holding renegade countries like North Korea to\r\ninternationally accepted standards of conduct in the critical\r\narea of nuclear non-proliferation. The international\r\ncommunity must continue to support such tried and tested\r\nmeasures and organizations.\r\nBut there is also an expectation that the end of the cold\r\nwar will enable the Security Council to play more ambitious\r\nroles and at last assume \"primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security\" under\r\nChapters V and VII of the Charter. In Cambodia, Haiti and\r\nSomalia, among other places, the United Nations is breaking\r\nnew ground by actively interposing itself as a vital\r\nstabilizing actor in situations which would once have been\r\nconsidered essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of\r\nStates.\r\nThe legal, diplomatic and political implications of these\r\ndevelopments are still unfolding and are not yet fully\r\nunderstood. Not everyone is entirely comfortable with them.\r\nBut I believe that most Member States regard the trend as\r\ngenerally positive and as making for a more secure world.\r\nThe majority wants a more active and effective Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the membership\r\nof the Security Council, submitted in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/62, has thus occasioned\r\ngreat interest. There is wide consensus that if it is to be\r\neffective in the next century the Security Council cannot\r\nsimply extrapolate its mandate from the starting-point of\r\n1945 after the cold-war interregnum, but must accurately\r\nreflect the current configuration of global power.\r\nInternational order cannot be built on nostalgia. Too great\r\na disjuncture from reality will doom the Security Council to\r\neventual irrelevance. As membership of the United Nations\r\nexpands, there is also a general expectation that the Security\r\nCouncil should become more representative of the\r\nOrganization as a whole.\r\nThe composition of the Security Council is a\r\ncompromise between the principle of the sovereign equality\r\nof States and the realities of power politics. That all States\r\nare equal but that some, for better or for worse, have a\r\ndisproportionate influence on the international order is a fact\r\nof life. Great-Power leadership is vital. It is a reality.\r\nRecognition of the special status of great Powers is thus a\r\nrequisite for effective action by the Security Council. When\r\nit comes to the crunch, only the great Powers can make a\r\ndecisive difference. But the temper of our times also\r\ndemands that if action is to command a general consensus:\r\nthe great must seek the mandate of the many.\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 17\r\nThe issue is, however, more easily defined than\r\nresolved. The only previous increase in the size of the\r\nSecurity Council began in the 1956 session of the General\r\nAssembly with discussions on an increase of non-permanent\r\nseats. Agreement was reached only in 1963 and came into\r\nforce two years later, almost a decade after the process had\r\nbegun. The lapse of time shows the complexities involved.\r\nThe difficulties are still with us. To be sure, there are\r\nestablished principles laid down in Article 23 (1) of the\r\nCharter to guide the way to a possible further expansion of\r\nnon-permanent seats. But there are no such guidelines for\r\nthe more crucial question of an increase in permanent\r\nmembers. The Secretary-General’s report must therefore be\r\nrealistically considered as only the beginning of a long\r\nprocess of debate whose outcome cannot be confidently\r\npredicted at this point.\r\nThere are two basic problems. The first is simply to\r\ndecide what is the current configuration of international\r\npower that should be reflected in the distribution of\r\npermanent seats. This is not as straightforward as it may\r\nseem. When the Charter was being drafted, the end of the\r\nSecond World War, with easily discernible winners and\r\nlosers, was in sight and was being prepared for. The\r\nintention was for the winners to have primary responsibility\r\nfor guiding the new international order. Yet even then, two\r\nof the \"Big Three\" victors, the Soviet Union and the United\r\nKingdom, were sceptical of Roosevelt’s view of China’s\r\nability to play a major role in the post-war world.\r\nChurchill’s insistence on including France among the elite\r\ngroup was met with similar scepticism by Roosevelt and\r\nStalin.\r\nIt will be even more difficult to decide who belongs to\r\nthe new elite. The end of the cold war took everyone by\r\nsurprise and was far from clear-cut in its resolution.\r\nEconomic, political and military power no longer necessarily\r\ncohere in one single locus. The United States is victor, but\r\nits economic recovery is slow and its competitiveness\r\nblunted. Russia is in serious economic and political\r\ndifficulties but, because it has nuclear weapons, it remains\r\na military great Power exercising a commanding influence\r\non its former dominions, where the threat of chaos in the\r\npost-cold-war world is also greatest. Japan and Germany are\r\nclearly world economic powerhouses, but both lack an\r\ninternal and regional consensus on the use of military forces\r\nbeyond their borders.\r\nThe second problem is even more fundamental and\r\nvexing. The United Nations is an international Organization.\r\nIt is not and was never intended to be a supranational\r\norganization. The United Nations was created by sovereign\r\nStates and can do nothing without their assent, in which\r\nprocess the permanent members have a more than\r\nproportionate say through their veto. I state this without\r\nrancour as a fact well known to all. Any design for\r\nenhancing the effectiveness of the Security Council therefore\r\ncannot just be based on abstract wisdom concerning the\r\nrequisites of the international order. No plan that has any\r\nprospect of succeeding can avoid reckoning with calculations\r\nof the national advantage of the current permanent members.\r\nBut if the new Security Council is really to reflect the\r\ncurrent international distribution of power, the process\r\nshould logically entail the deposition of some from the elite\r\nas well as the anointment of others. Even if some were to\r\nbe elevated without necessarily displacing others, the\r\nexpansion of the small group of the select would imply the\r\nrelative diminution of the status of the current permanent\r\nmembers. It is not surprising, therefore, that only one\r\npermanent member has so far come out unambiguously in\r\nfavour of an expansion in the number of permanent seats.\r\nIt does not take a cynic to wonder whether it was\r\nemboldened to do so because the others have been so\r\nconspicuously coy on this critical point. No country has\r\never voluntarily relinquished privilege and power. We are\r\nafter all in the company of sovereign States, not saints.\r\nThere is no circumventing the veto. There is no\r\nconstitutional means of amending the Charter without the\r\nassent of all the permanent members, some of whom may\r\nbelieve they stand to lose by it. Yet change is imperative if\r\nwe are not to squander the opportunity afforded by the end\r\nof the cold war - more so for small States that have few\r\nbetter choices than an effective United Nations for their\r\nsecurity.\r\nTo make progress, there is no alternative but gradually\r\nto shape a consensus through a patient process of debate and\r\ndiscussion. To force the pace or attempt to impose a\r\nmajority agreement will not work. At this preliminary stage,\r\nit would be most useful to try to identify and build\r\nconsensus on objective general criteria that all permanent\r\nmembers, present or aspiring, must fulfil. This is a more\r\nclinical and constructive approach than engaging in a horse\r\nrace or a beauty contest to pick specific countries. To\r\nattempt to do so at this stage is premature and would only\r\nbe divisive. But the identification of objective criteria will\r\nset a common standard and, if we can agree on them, a\r\nconsensus on specific countries will naturally emerge.\r\nThis will entail thinking through the role of the United\r\nNations into the next century. What challenges will the\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nUnited Nations face in the next decade? What will be the\r\nrole and priorities of a new Security Council under these\r\nconditions? What capabilities will it need? These difficult\r\nquestions demand the most exhaustive possible examination.\r\nThe General Assembly should consider the formation of a\r\nworking group, representative of the whole membership, to\r\nconsider them and formulate agreed objective criteria for the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council, especially its permanent\r\nmembership.\r\nTo stimulate discussion, Singapore suggests the\r\nfollowing:\r\nFirst, there should be a level playing field with regard\r\nto all present and future members of a possible expanded\r\nSecurity Council. Anachronistic references to \"enemy\r\nStates\" in Articles 53, 77 and 107 of the Charter should be\r\nremoved. It is time to set aside the baggage of the past.\r\nSuggestions that there could be or should be a different set\r\nof permanent members without the veto are also impractical.\r\nNo country that is capable of making a contribution as a\r\nnew permanent member will accept such second-class status\r\nfor long. It will only undermine the principle of great-Power\r\ncooperation, in the absence of which the Security Council\r\ncannot function. Nor is it practical or even desirable to do\r\naway with the veto. The fact that the veto has been abused\r\ndoes not detract from its intended function. It is a\r\nrecognition of the hard reality that great Powers will not\r\nconsent to put their power at the disposal of a sheer majority\r\nfor the implementation of decisions which they do not agree\r\nwith. It is a safety valve that prevents the United Nations\r\nfrom undertaking commitments that it lacks the power to\r\nfulfil. However, to minimize the misuse of the veto, if\r\npermanent membership is expanded at least two vetoes\r\nshould be required to block a resolution.\r\nSecondly, privilege must be paid for. An expanded role\r\nfor the Security Council will require more resources. A\r\nUnited Nations perennially on the brink of financial\r\ninsolvency cannot effectively meet the challenges of the next\r\ncentury. A permanent member should therefore carry a\r\nlarger portion of the financial burden of the United Nations.\r\nEach permanent member should pay at least 9 per cent of\r\nthe operating expenses of the United Nations as well as\r\n11 per cent of the costs of the peace-keeping operations of\r\nthe United Nations, which are the average percentages of the\r\npermanent five’s current collective percentage of these\r\nbudgets.\r\nThirdly, permanent members must have muscle and the\r\nwill and the capability to wield it for the cause of the United\r\nNations. The main mission and primary responsibility of the\r\nSecurity Council is to maintain international peace and\r\nstability. Force will be needed in pursuit of order and the\r\nSecurity Council cannot be effective without a sword that is\r\nsharp and ready. All permanent members should be\r\nprepared to give effect to Article 43 of the Charter and be\r\nready to place their military forces at the disposal of the\r\nUnited Nations and shed blood to uphold international order\r\nif necessary.\r\nThis list is by no means exhaustive. Other members\r\nwill have their own suggestions for appropriate criteria. I\r\nurge all members to participate in discussions on the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council so that we may have the\r\nbenefit of the fullest possible range of views and emerge\r\nwith the widest possible consensus.\r\nFinally, Mr. President, I should like to congratulate you\r\non your unanimous election. I am confident that you will\r\nlead the Assembly at this session effectively. I should also\r\nlike to take this opportunity to welcome the six new\r\nMembers that have joined the Organization. I am certain\r\nthat they will contribute positively to the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. TSERING (Bhutan): I have the honour to convey\r\nto all members of the Assembly the warm greetings and\r\ngood wishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King\r\nof Bhutan, for the success of the forty-eighth session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly.\r\nI begin by congratulating you, Mr. President, on your\r\nunanimous election. We are confident that with your wide\r\nknowledge and experience you will provide proper direction\r\nto our discussions. We would also like to pay a tribute to\r\nour outgoing President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the exemplary\r\nmanner in which he led the Assembly at the last session.\r\nWe extend a warm welcome to the peoples and\r\nGovernments of Andorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, The\r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco and the\r\nRepublic of Slovakia on their joining the family of nations.\r\nWe are confident that their membership will add to the\r\nstrength and vitality of the Organization.\r\nWe would like to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dynamic\r\nleadership. His initiatives have already started to steer the\r\ncourse of the United Nations into new and bold directions.\r\nHis report to the Assembly is clear and concise and provides\r\na good basis for the work of this session.\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 19\r\nThe momentous events taking place around us in this\r\nnew decade continue to pose challenges and offer\r\nopportunities of an unprecedented scale. The handshake on\r\nthe White House lawn between Prime Minister Rabin and\r\nChairman Arafat opened a window for peace and tolerance\r\nin the Middle East after a century of hatred and suspicion.\r\nWhen President Clinton called the agreement the \"peace of\r\nthe brave\", he paid just tribute to their courage. Deep-seated\r\nemotions will continue to blur reason and not all groups will\r\ntake to the road of healing at the same pace. We join those\r\ncalling on extremist factions on both sides to desist from the\r\nuse of force. My delegation hopes that the agreement will\r\nlead to a comprehensive and durable peace on the basis of\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We appeal to the\r\ninternational community to give even stronger support to the\r\nimplementation of the agreement in all its aspects.\r\nWith regard to the situation in the Persian Gulf, we\r\nurge all parties to abide by Security Council resolution 833\r\n(1993). It is our view that for the full recognition of\r\nKuwait’s sovereignty, the boundary as demarcated by the\r\nUnited Nations must be internationally respected.\r\nMy delegation is happy with the progressive\r\ndismantling of apartheid and the process towards universal\r\nfranchise in South Africa. We have recently heard in this\r\nforum Mr. Mandela’s historic call to end all sanctions\r\nagainst South Africa, a call which must be speedily\r\nhonoured.\r\nWe applaud the positive results of United Nations\r\ninvolvement in Cambodia, El Salvador and Haiti. These\r\nsuccesses, however, have not yet been replicated in Somalia\r\nand Bosnia. My delegation strongly condemns violence\r\nagainst United Nations peace-keeping and humanitarian\r\nworkers. As the need for peace-keeping in other parts of the\r\nworld grows, it is clear that in future the terms of every\r\nintervention must be carefully defined.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the reduction in the\r\ninternational arsenal of nuclear and other weapons and we\r\nsupport the continuation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\nbeyond 1995.\r\nWith regard to the nuclear situation on the Korean\r\npeninsula, we urge the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea to comply fully with the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) Safeguards Agreement in order to avoid any\r\nsuspicion and speculation.\r\nIn an age focused on reducing the world’s nuclear\r\narsenal, further testing is unnecessary and inconsistent. We\r\nurge all nuclear States not to carry out further tests and to\r\ncontinue negotiations towards a comprehensive test ban.\r\nWhile the world’s nuclear arms and other weapons of\r\nmass destruction are being dismantled, we are aware that\r\nconventional weapons are used in all present-day conflicts.\r\nNo country which supplies arms can dissociate itself from\r\nthe moral responsibility for the use of such arms. We fully\r\nsupport the United Nations Register on Conventional Arms\r\nand urge the reduction of the international arms trade.\r\nOver the past two years, considerable emphasis has\r\nbeen put on streamlining the United Nations Secretariat and\r\nmaking it more efficient. At the last two sessions the\r\nGeneral Assembly has directed its attention not only towards\r\nreforming and revitalizing the United Nations but also\r\ntowards making the General Assembly a more effective and\r\nresponsive forum. While some progress has been made, the\r\ndiscussion on reforming and restructuring the United Nations\r\ncontinues. We cannot expect the United Nations, formed\r\nnearly five decades ago with just 50 members, to remain\r\nunchanged and yet be able to fulfil the hopes and\r\nexpectations of the current 184 Members in a vastly different\r\nworld. Clearly, the reforms and revitalization cannot be\r\nlimited to managerial and organizational changes: the roles\r\nand responsibilities of all the principal organs of the United\r\nNations must be taken into account.\r\nMy delegation believes that during our discussion on\r\nreforming the United Nations, the time is opportune to\r\nenlarge the Security Council. The expansion of its\r\nmembership must be taken up together with the issue of\r\naccountability. While it is necessary to preserve the Security\r\nCouncil’s new-found effectiveness, it must always be made\r\naccountable for its actions to the General Assembly.\r\nThe need for reform and restructuring seems in recent\r\nmonths to have been somewhat overshadowed by the\r\nOrganization’s financial difficulties and questions of\r\neffective operations and proper accountability. We fully\r\nagree that it is necessary to minimize waste and streamline\r\noperations. These issues, however, must be pursued\r\nindependently of the concerns over the financial health of the\r\nUnited Nations. We urge all Members to pay their assessed\r\ncontributions promptly. We are of the view that the current\r\nlevel of assessment has fully taken into account both the\r\nfinancial capacity of Member States to contribute and the\r\nrole they have assumed in the Organization. There is a\r\nsaying in my country that one must load the pony according\r\nto its ability to carry the burden. Although the United\r\nNations has travelled far in the last three years, it is clear\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nnow that we cannot keep overloading it without putting the\r\nnecessary means and resources at its disposal.\r\nThe Second World Conference on Human Rights, held\r\nin Vienna this year, clearly recognized that social progress\r\nand political stability cannot be ensured without respect for\r\nhuman rights. The Conference also recognized that human\r\nrights and social progress can be promoted and preserved\r\nonly in a healthy economic and natural environment. For\r\nour part, we are fully committed to advancing the human\r\nrights of all our people.\r\nThis year, as agreed to in Agenda 21 of the Earth\r\nSummit, the Commission on Sustainable Development has\r\nbeen established. The work of this Commission will provide\r\na new direction for the preservation of the environment and\r\ngive added impetus to developmental activities. We\r\nrecognize that while all development must take place at local\r\nand national levels, there are clearly regional and\r\ninternational dimensions for which solutions must be found\r\nat the global level. Bhutan looks forward to participating in\r\nthe upcoming global conferences on population and\r\ndevelopment, the World Summit for Social Development and\r\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women.\r\nThe recession that has afflicted much of the world\r\neconomy in the past year has not shown any signs of\r\nimprovement. In such conditions, it is hardly surprising that\r\nthe economic performances of most of the world’s least\r\ndeveloped countries have continued to be dismal. Per capita\r\nincome for the one tenth of the world’s population which\r\nlives in these countries has fallen in the past three years\r\ndespite the adoption of the United Nations Programme of\r\nAction in 1990. While the least developed countries have\r\nbegun to initiate bold and painful structural reforms in their\r\neconomies, budget constraints on donor nations and\r\ncompeting claims on aid resources have continued to slow\r\ndown the flow of official development assistance to the least\r\ndeveloped countries. While expressing our gratitude to\r\ndonors who have met and even exceeded official\r\ndevelopment assistance targets, my delegation would like to\r\nappeal to the others to follow suit so that the reforms can be\r\nsustained and promoted.\r\nThe sluggish international economic climate in the last\r\ntwo years has been further compounded by a spate of\r\nunusually harsh natural disasters that have affected many\r\nparts of the world. We would like to express our heartfelt\r\nsympathies to all those in the United States of America,\r\nJapan, Nepal, and India who have suffered heavy loss of life\r\nand property because of recent natural calamities. The\r\ncapacity to respond to such disasters should be placed high\r\non the international agenda. This includes long-term\r\ninvestment in environmental conservation and other\r\nmeasures, including early warning facilities, to protect\r\nagainst natural disasters.\r\nBhutan continues to make considerable progress in the\r\nfield of social and economic development. We are currently\r\nin the process of decentralizing the administration in terms\r\nof decision-making and implementation of development\r\nprojects. We are also giving priority to the development of\r\nhuman resources. In all our nation-building activities, we\r\nhave sought to protect our rich natural environment and\r\ndistinctive national identity. In our efforts, we have\r\ncontinued to receive generous support from India, Japan,\r\nSwitzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Kuwait, Austria,\r\nNorway, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia, and\r\nfrom various specialized agencies and bodies of the United\r\nNations, particularly the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Fund for Activites (UNFPA),\r\nthe United Nations Capital Development Fund, (UNCDF),\r\nthe International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),\r\nthe World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations\r\nVolunteers (UNV), the Food and Agriculture Organization\r\nof the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization\r\n(WHO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), and the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO). I take this opportunity to express the sincere\r\ngratitude of the people and Government of Bhutan to our\r\ndevelopment partners.\r\nThis is an age of multilateralism, and the United\r\nNations is the centre around which this new age will\r\nrevolve. The United Nations is no longer just the\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 21\r\npreserver of world order but an active promoter of peace and\r\nhuman advancement. Increasing cooperation among its\r\nMembers since the end of the cold war has made it possible\r\nfor the Organization to become more effective in pursuing\r\nthese objectives. The long-term success of the United\r\nNations, in our view, will depend on how democratic it\r\nbecomes in its functioning and to what extent it will involve\r\nall its Members, large and small, in the decision-making\r\nprocess. We hope that the United Nations will become the\r\ncenterpiece of a more just and equitable world order and will\r\nspeak for the whole of humanity rather than just for a\r\nprivileged few.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Despite at least two reminders on\r\nmy part so far of the Assembly’s decision to prohibit the\r\npractice of expressing congratulations in the precincts of this\r\nHall, this practice appears to flourish. It is not my intention\r\nto have this decision further undermined under my watch.\r\nI therefore warn all delegations that if the practice resumes,\r\nI shall be forced to interrupt the speaker - discourteously, of\r\ncourse - to allow for order to be restored. I appeal once\r\nagain to the Assembly to respect the decision we have all\r\ntaken together for the orderly performance of our work.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
