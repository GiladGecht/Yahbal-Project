In a\r\nletter contained in that document, the Secretary-General\r\ninforms me that, since the issuance of his communications\r\ndated 21, 24, 27 and 29 September and 4 October 1993, the\r\nGambia has made the necessary payment to reduce its\r\narrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note\r\nof this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nADDRESS BY MAJOR-GENERAL JUVENAL\r\nHABYARIMANA, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC\r\nOF RWANDA\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Rwanda.\r\nMajor-General Juvénal Habyarimana, President of the\r\nRepublic of Rwanda, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic\r\nof Rwanda, His Excellency Major-General Juvénal\r\nHabyarimana, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident HABYARIMANA (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I am experiencing a feeling of signal honour and\r\ngenuine pleasure, and also at the same time a deep feeling\r\nas I now, on behalf of my country, Rwanda, speak before\r\nthis prestigious General Assembly of the United Nations,\r\nwhich each year considers the fate of our world.\r\nAbove all, I should like to associate myself with the\r\neminent speakers who have spoken before me here, to\r\nextend to you, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of which I am\r\nthe head, our warmest congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its\r\nforty-eighth session. We are assured that your personal\r\nqualities and your extensive experience in international\r\nissues will assist you in discharging this difficult\r\nresponsibility. Your personal qualities and your experience\r\nare the best guarantee of the success of the work of the\r\npresent session. We also wish to congratulate all the other\r\nmembers of the General Committee, who, we are sure, will\r\nspare no effort in assisting you in successfully discharging\r\nthe difficult task entrusted to you. The delegation of the\r\nRepublic of Rwanda will spare no effort to participate\r\nactively and effectively to ensure a successful conclusion of\r\nthe debate on the items on the agenda of this session.\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86776 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.19\r\n25 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMoreover, we wish to render a well-deserved tribute to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who was always\r\ninspired by the same concern for effectiveness in the cause\r\nof peace, justice and international security. He deserves our\r\ndeep gratitude for having guided with wisdom and\r\ncompetence the work of the forty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe should also like to take advantage of this happy\r\nopportunity to warmly welcome the presence here with us of\r\nnew Member States, the admission of which is an important\r\nstage towards achieving the universality of the Organization.\r\nThe forty-eighth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly is opening at a time when the world presents to us\r\na rather gloomy picture. Here and there are several scattered\r\nislets of peace and prosperity but they are few indeed.\r\nMoreover, in various corners of the world armed conflicts\r\nand political tensions are ready to explode into open crisis\r\nand economic and social ruin. In many countries we find\r\npoverty and upheavals in the quest for more balanced\r\nsocieties, and everywhere there is anguish in the face of so\r\nmany challenges which confront the conscience of man and\r\nwhich spawn fear for the future.\r\nFortunately, good will is being demonstrated and\r\nmobilized at the level of States, non-governmental\r\norganizations, and regional and international organizations -\r\nin the forefront of which is the United Nations - to arouse\r\nthe universal conscience, extinguish the fires, accompany\r\npolitical change, allay misery and renew hope and the\r\nenjoyment of life for those for whom the horizon seems\r\nclosed and gloomy.\r\nIt is an appropriate time and place to pay a sincere\r\ntribute to the world Organization and to its tireless\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for all the\r\nactions undertaken and carried out with skill and designed to\r\nrestore peace in regions and countries devastated by war, to\r\nprevent other conflicts, and to assist disadvantaged peoples\r\nor those sorely tried by disasters of all types. To be sure,\r\nthe means are limited, but is not this Organization the last\r\nhope of people?\r\nAnd success nurtures that hope. Thus we welcome\r\nenthusiastically the end of the civil war in Cambodia and the\r\nre-establishment of State institutions in that country.\r\nRwanda welcomes the progress that has been made\r\ntowards a settlement of the conflict in Mozambique and is\r\nfollowing particularly closely the political developments in\r\nSouth Africa. While the system of apartheid in the latter has\r\nnot yet been completely eliminated, recent developments\r\npromise positive and rapid progress.\r\nRwanda is also most gratified at the very positive\r\ncourse of the Middle East peace negotiations, which, thanks\r\nto mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and to the signing, in\r\nWashington on 13 September 1993, of an agreement on\r\nPalestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, have just gone\r\nthrough a very important stage. We hope that this historic\r\nagreement, which lays the bases for reconciliation between\r\nIsraelis and Palestinians, will open the way to a lasting\r\nsolution to all the issues connected with the problem of the\r\nMiddle East and will lead ultimately to peace and calm in\r\nthat part of the world.\r\nTo that end, we call on the international community to\r\nredouble its efforts to secure positive results for the attempts\r\nnow being made to settle the conflicts in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Liberia, Angola, Somalia and all other\r\ncountries where peoples are being battered, divided and\r\nplunged into misery by individual or tribal egoism and\r\nambition or are having their sovereignty threatened by the\r\ninordinate greed of other States.\r\nAt the level of international economic relations, it is\r\ndepressing to note that, to this day, three quarters of\r\nmankind live on the sidelines of economic and social\r\nprogress, in so far as numerous structural imbalances\r\ncontinue to hamper the efforts of the countries of the South\r\nto achieve self-development and international cooperation.\r\nIndeed, despite the concerted efforts at integration, despite\r\nthe internal adjustments still undertaken at enormous\r\nsacrifice, and despite the expressions of good will for\r\ninternational partnership, foreign debt continues to grow, and\r\nthe gap between the economies of the North and those of the\r\nSouth continues to widen.\r\nThe delegation of Rwanda is convinced that if the lot\r\nof mankind is to be improved, the international community\r\nmust undertake measures that can promote the emergence of\r\na new, more balanced and more equitable world economic\r\norder. In this regard, only a common political will on the\r\npart of all the Members of this Organization can help to\r\ncorrect the structural imbalances in the global economy and\r\nto open the way to a new partnership in which\r\ninterdependence means, first and foremost, a shared destiny\r\nfor mankind, in which international cooperation is even more\r\nsynonymous with success that benefits all the partners - the\r\nseal of fraternity and the promise of genuine solidarity.\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 3\r\nRwanda has always believed that international\r\ncooperation, if it is to be more effective, must be based to an\r\neven greater extent on intense, transparent, consistent and\r\nconcise action agreed with our partners and undertaken\r\nwithin what must one day be regarded as a genuine contract\r\nof solidarity. Rwanda has always believed that well-planned\r\ncooperation implies the concept of co-management, of co-\r\nresponsibility. This means shared responsibility, ongoing\r\ndialogue, transparency of commitments and acceptance of\r\nthe right of all sides to make mistakes, so that, to a greater\r\nextent than in the past, cooperation can meet the stakes of\r\nthe future. To secure even more genuine cooperation, the\r\ninternational community must seek effective solutions to all\r\nthese challenges that are leading us into institutionalized,\r\ncrushing debt.\r\nIn addition, the scope of international cooperation can\r\nbe widened, and its impact increased, only through genuine\r\nintegration of action and of programmes in the context of a\r\nnational strategy and with a global vision of authentic self-\r\ndevelopment. Rwanda has always attached special\r\nimportance to international cooperation, to which it owes so\r\nmuch of its progress, its development and its achievements.\r\nWith regard to the political situation in Rwanda, my\r\ncountry, as Members know, is emerging from a pointless and\r\nundeserved war, which was imposed on it three years ago,\r\non 1 October 1990. Allow me, before sketching out the\r\nsituation into which this war has plunged the population of\r\nRwanda and the country’s economy, to emphasize once\r\nagain the role of the international community in resolving\r\ncrises and conflicts, for the ending of the war in my country\r\nis the result of a miracle of international solidarity.\r\nThere is no doubt that this required the good will of the\r\ntwo parties to the conflict. Wisdom prevailed over ambition,\r\nand hatred yielded to the nation’s need to survive. But the\r\nwill of the two parties to pool their efforts was strongly\r\nsupported by countries neighbouring Rwanda, among which\r\nthe two parties chose, by common agreement, the Republic\r\nof Zaire as Mediator and the United Republic of Tanzania as\r\nFacilitator.\r\nThe two warring parties benefited also from the skilled\r\nhelp of President Abdou Diouf of Senegal, who was at that\r\ntime Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, and of\r\ncertain friendly countries - France, Belgium, the Federal\r\nRepublic of Germany and the United States of America. In\r\naddition, they received most valuable assistance from the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations. All\r\nthese countries and international organizations sent\r\nrepresentatives to Arusha, Tanzania, to take part in the peace\r\nnegotiations that had begun in Zaire following the launching\r\nof hostilities, that had continued in Tanzania for a year, with\r\ntheir participation, and that culminated in a peace agreement.\r\nI take this opportunity to express once again to all these\r\ncountries and organizations the sincere gratitude of the\r\nGovernment and people of Rwanda for their highly valuable\r\ncontribution to the positive outcome of the negotiations,\r\nwhich were very trying to all who were involved and which\r\non numerous occasions would have been on the verge of\r\ncollapse had it not been for the tenacity and determination\r\nof the two parties and the wise and firm advice of all friends\r\npresent.\r\nThis senseless war that befell Rwanda is now subsiding,\r\nthanks to the peace agreement that was signed in Arusha on\r\n4 August 1993. It was bloody and devastating. We mourn\r\ntens of thousands of victims. The war resulted in\r\nconsiderable destruction of infrastructure, equipment and\r\nsocio-economic and administrative systems, and it left in a\r\nstate of dire poverty more than 900,000 displaced persons,\r\nwhose property went up in smoke.\r\nThat war has left us with orphans and invalids of all\r\nages, widows, helpless old people and hundreds of thousands\r\nof economic victims. In the regions affected by the war,\r\nmisery and desolation hold sway. Education has been\r\nseverely jeopardized and the psychological consequences for\r\nthe most vulnerable age groups are doubtless incalculable.\r\nThis war has destroyed the fragile equilibrium of the\r\ncountry’s food supply and has exacerbated the famine which\r\nhas struck the entire country, because it broke out in the\r\ncountry’s most fertile regions, which have not been\r\ncultivated for three years now. The representatives of\r\ninternational bodies and non-governmental organizations who\r\nvisited the camps of displaced persons cannot forget the\r\ndesolate sight of the make-shift shelters where hundreds of\r\nthousands of human beings, crammed together in highly\r\nunsanitary conditions, continue to lead lives that are close to\r\nintolerable. Those representatives cannot forget the long\r\nlines of hungry people on the roads, seeking the assistance\r\nsent them by the international community, which with\r\ndifficulty was able to deliver it to them for their survival.\r\nAnd what can we say of the economy in general?\r\nAlready badly shaken, it is today in even worse condition,\r\nfollowing the enormous expenditures resulting from the war\r\nand the destruction it caused. Thus, after the signing of the\r\nArusha Peace Agreement, the time has come for the long-\r\nterm, enormous work of national reconstruction in the newly\r\nregained peace and calm, without forgetting the other, no\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nless important objective, the implementation of national\r\nreconciliation and the continued strengthening of the process\r\nof democratization in the management of the country. We\r\ncan already welcome the establishment of a multi-party\r\nsystem by the constitutional review of 10 June 1991, thanks\r\nto which 17 political parties were agreed upon. Five of\r\nthem are at present forming a transition Government which\r\nsoon will be expanded to the Rwanda Patriotic Front for a\r\nnew transitional period which should lead to pluralist, free\r\nand democratic elections.\r\nOn the economic level, Rwanda has been experiencing\r\na crisis since the 1980s, which has had negative\r\nrepercussions on the implementation of the budget and has\r\nbeen exacerbated not only by the war but also by the\r\nunpredictable nature of external shocks, in particular the\r\ncollapse of the international price of coffee, our primary\r\nexport.\r\nAs it was no longer possible to control the growth of\r\npublic expenditures and of the fundamental imbalance in the\r\nbalance of trade, in combination with a production system\r\nwhose structure is very fragile, my country implemented, in\r\nNovember 1990, a programme of recovery having the\r\nfollowing priorities: to relaunch the economy, to achieve\r\ninternal and external financial balance, to promote domestic\r\nsavings, to encourage the activity of the private sector and\r\nto improve the management of the public sector.\r\nRwanda’s structural adjustment programme has been\r\ngiven great technical and financial support by all the donors,\r\nheaded by the Bretton Woods institutions. Unfortunately,\r\nthe launching of this programme, which the Government\r\ncould apparently have carried out without too many sudden\r\ndetours, coincided with the attack of October 1990.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like most solemnly to thank\r\nthe international community for the support it has accorded\r\nRwanda both with assistance in the balance of payments and\r\nwith development projects. We are even more grateful for\r\nthe priority the international community has given to\r\nassistance for those displaced by the war, in answer to the\r\nconsolidated appeal made by the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs of the United Nations, whose\r\ndedication is inestimable.\r\nFollowing the war and the new deterioration of the\r\nterms of trade which affected the economy of Rwanda, the\r\nvery backbone of our structural adjustment programme is\r\nthreatened. I am speaking here of the liberalization of\r\nexternal and internal trade which requires a comfortable\r\ncurrency reserve situation.\r\nThe Government of Rwanda has just decided upon the\r\nprimary features of its short- and medium-term post-war\r\neconomic policy from 1993 to 1996, items we have\r\nsubmitted to the international community. This policy\r\nreflects the Government’s commitment to do all in its power\r\nto stabilize the large financial balances and to launch the\r\nprocess of economic recovery on the basis of the\r\nfundamental strategy of the structural adjustment programme,\r\nwhich gives a key role to market forces. In short, the\r\npositive results of the measures that have been in place since\r\nNovember 1990 must be capitalized upon, and new measures\r\nrequired by the deterioration of short- and medium-term\r\neconomic prospects, linked to the war, must be planned.\r\nTherefore, in accordance with the contents of the Peace\r\nAgreement, the priorities of the expanded transitional\r\nGovernment are to pursue efforts at economic recovery and\r\nto work on four programmes for specifically post-war\r\neconomic development: emergency assistance to those\r\ndisplaced by the war in order to help them return to their\r\nproperty, assistance in the reintegration of Rwandese\r\nrefugees, assistance in reconstruction and assistance in the\r\nsocial and economic reintegration of demobilized military\r\npersonnel.\r\nFor the repatriation of Rwandese refugees in accordance\r\nwith the Dar-es-Salaam Declaration of 19 February 1991, a\r\ndonors’ meeting will be organized at the initiative of the\r\nGovernment, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR). With the war, we saw all types of\r\ndestruction, particularly the damaging and/or destruction of\r\nseveral thousands of hectares of forest which will even\r\nfurther aggravate the wood shortage. With the end of the\r\nwar, the country will have to dispose of the funds to\r\ndemobilize more than 31,000 military personnel. We will\r\nalso have to locate throughout the country paying jobs and\r\ntraining which can facilitate their social and economic\r\nreintegration.\r\nWithin the framework of the preparation for the\r\nprogrammes of reconstruction and socio-economic\r\nreintegration of demobilized military personnel, I have\r\npersonally sent a request to the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, on 2 January 1993, and an inter-agency\r\nmission of the United Nations systems and of the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) is at present\r\nbacking the Government of Rwanda in the preparation of the\r\ndocument to be submitted to the donors at a round table for\r\nhumanitarian emergency assistance.\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 5\r\nRwanda is trying to manage its meagre resources in an\r\nextremely difficult context. But it remains committed to the\r\nstrategy of economic development contained in the structural\r\nadjustment programme it launched in November 1990, with,\r\nas its base, the process of economic liberalization that has\r\nalready begun and is giving the private sector a larger role\r\nin decision-making.\r\nBy signing the Peace Agreement the Government of\r\nRwanda firmly committed itself to strengthening the basis of\r\na State of law in which public freedoms, together with\r\npolitical rights, justice and equality, will be guaranteed. In\r\nthat Agreement the two parties have agreed that an\r\nindependent National Commission for Human Rights will be\r\nestablished entrusted with dealing with violations of human\r\nrights perpetrated by any person on Rwandan territory and,\r\nin particular, by State bodies and by persons under cover of\r\nthe State or other organizations. Simultaneously, the\r\nGovernment will move to improve the functioning of the\r\nlegal and penal systems, in particular by forbidding arbitrary\r\nand illegal arrests and inhumane treatment of detainees and\r\nby severely punishing the perpetrators of such acts.\r\nSince the country’s human, material and financial\r\nmeans are severely limited, an appeal will be made to\r\nforeign financial and technological assistance, especially in\r\nthe area of the training of magistrates and officials of the\r\nOffice of the Public Prosecutor and Ministry of Justice\r\npersonnel.\r\nIn the Peace Agreement the Government of Rwanda has\r\nalso reaffirmed its determination to reach a final settlement\r\nof the refugee problem, a goal to which it had committed\r\nitself in the Dar-es-Salaam Declaration of 19 February 1991\r\nat the regional summit meeting which examined the problem\r\nof Rwandan refugees.\r\nThe task will be a difficult one for the broad-based\r\ntransitional government envisaged in the agreement within\r\nthe framework of the Protocols of Agreement on Power-\r\nsharing between the country’s political parties and the\r\nRwandese Patriotic Front (RPF). That Government will be\r\nset up in the next few days, as soon as the prerequisite\r\nconditions have been met. The task will also be a difficult\r\none for the people of Rwanda as a whole, who will be the\r\nultimate authors and beneficiaries of the hoped-for progress\r\nand well-being.\r\nNevertheless, despite the will and determination of the\r\nRwandan people and their Government, we must\r\nacknowledge the utter insufficiency of the domestic means\r\navailable, given the titanic labour to be accomplished. We\r\nthus look to the international community to support and\r\nsupplement our own efforts.\r\nThe first contribution we expect from the international\r\ncommunity is the deployment, as rapidly as possible, of an\r\ninternational neutral force, as provided in the Arusha\r\nAgreement. On behalf of the people of Rwanda, I should\r\nlike to express to the United Nations as a whole, and to the\r\nmembers of the Security Council in particular, our gratitude\r\nfor the historic decision the Organization took yesterday in\r\nadopting the resolution establishing the United Nations\r\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), so long awaited\r\nfor the implementation of the Arusha Peace Agreement.\r\nThe Agreement assigns to that force the task of\r\nfacilitating the implementation of the Peace Agreement,\r\nspecifically by supervising implementation of the Protocol on\r\nthe Integration of the Armed Forces of the Two Parties and\r\nby providing various kinds of assistance to the authorities\r\nand competent bodies. The Agreement also assigns to\r\nUNAMIR security tasks, including, inter alia, monitoring the\r\noverall security situation in the country and investigating and\r\nreporting on activities carried out by the competent\r\nauthorities and bodies in the maintenance of public order;\r\nassisting in ensuring the security of the civilian population;\r\nassisting with mine-clearance operations; assisting in the\r\nidentification of arms stockpiles and the neutralization of\r\narmed bands throughout the country, and monitoring the\r\nrespect by both sides of the comprehensive cease-fire and\r\ncessation of hostilities, as provided in the Peace Agreement.\r\nLastly, the Arusha Peace Agreement entrusts the neutral\r\ninternational force with the tasks of supervising the training\r\nprocess of the national armed forces, and here I would\r\nmention only the supervision of the disengagement of forces,\r\nsupervision of the demobilization of all the military forces\r\nand the Gendarmerie, and participation in the training\r\nprogramme for members of the New National Army and\r\nNational Gendarmerie.\r\nThis is some indication of how necessary and urgent\r\nthe establishment of the neutral international force is in order\r\nto allow for the creation of the broad-based transitional\r\ngovernment and the reintegration of persons displaced by the\r\nwar, the repatriation of refugees and, in a\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ngeneral manner, national reconstruction in conditions of\r\nmaximum security.\r\nAnother extremely vital contribution we expect from the\r\ninternational community, and more specifically from the\r\nUnited Nations system and, on a bilateral level, from the\r\nfriendly countries and various non-governmental\r\norganizations, will be that of financing the priority\r\nprogrammes to which I referred a few moments ago.\r\nToday, more than ever, Rwanda needs the attention,\r\nconcern and good will of the international community. It is\r\nrelying on that community’s generosity to re-establish itself\r\nand to recover from the horrors of war. May that hope be\r\nrealized soon.\r\nWith the support of the international community the\r\npeople of Rwanda hope to pass smoothly through a transition\r\nperiod that, notwithstanding the guidelines of the Peace\r\nAgreement, could still turn out to be arduous. The people\r\nof Rwanda, however, are relying on the patriotism and sense\r\nof responsibility that their political authorities and the leaders\r\nof the parties in the government and the Transitional\r\nAssembly must demonstrate to consolidate the democratic\r\ngains and lay down, once and for all, the foundations of\r\npeace and national harmony. Once the demons of division\r\nhave been exorcised, the people of Rwanda will surely build\r\na new nation and experience once again uninterrupted\r\nprogress.\r\nAt this session of the General Assembly elections will\r\nbe held for a number of seats on the Security Council.\r\nRwanda has officially put forward its candidacy to become\r\na non-permanent member of that body entrusted with\r\nresponsibility for international peace and security. Its\r\ncandidacy was endorsed at the last Summit Meeting of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) held at Cairo at the\r\nend of June this year. As the Head of State, I ask for the\r\nAssembly’s trust in my country, Rwanda, which has never\r\nyet had a seat on the Security Council. As a State\r\nconcerned to carry out its responsibilities, including those on\r\nthe international level, Rwanda believes that it can, today\r\nmore than yesterday, make its modest contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of peace in the world and to the restoration of\r\npeace in troubled regions and countries.\r\nEmerging as it now is from a war that has tried it\r\nsorely, Rwanda is better aware of the price of peace, the\r\npeace it has now regained thanks in particular to the efforts\r\nof the international community.\r\nThose are the reasons that have motivated Rwanda to\r\nput forward its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the\r\nSecurity Council: to assist other warring nations to return to\r\npeace, but also to work, together with the other members of\r\nthe Council, for the strengthening of peace within its own\r\nborders. Rwanda hopes that it will have your confidence.\r\nAn ancient country that was under United Nations\r\ntrusteeship throughout the period prior to its accession to\r\nnational independence, my country, Rwanda, which has just\r\nemerged from the throes of an unmentionable war and now\r\nyearns to rebuild, relying on the lessons of the past, has\r\nevery reason to feel that it has matured, and it assures you\r\nof its unswerving determination to work for the advent of\r\npeace in the world and understanding among nations. On its\r\nbehalf, I repeat to the United Nations, our Organization, our\r\nsincerest wishes that it may succeed and flourish for the\r\nhappiness of all mankind.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Rwanda for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMajor-General Juvénal Habyarimana, President of the\r\nRepublic of Rwanda, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nPrince MOHAMED BOLKIAH (Brunei Darussalam):\r\nBefore making my statement I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to express my country’s deepest sympathy with\r\nthe Government and people of India as they mourn the\r\nthousands of lives lost during last week’s earthquake.\r\nI wish to congratulate you on your election,\r\nMr. President; to thank the outgoing President for his\r\ncontribution to the work of the United Nations; and to\r\nwelcome all the new Members of our Organization.\r\nMuch has been expected of the United Nations in the\r\npast year. Its priority has been to ensure that the profound\r\npolitical and economic change does not result in global\r\nconflict. This has sometimes meant coordinating\r\ninternational efforts. On other occasions the United Nations\r\nhas had to take the lead in these operations. At the same\r\ntime, it has continued to take up the challenges presented by\r\nthe many far-reaching social, humanitarian and\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 7\r\nenvironmental problems of our day. These have proved\r\nmore and more difficult to contain within national or even\r\nregional boundaries.\r\nThe United Nations responsibilities have often been\r\nundertaken under most unfavourable conditions. I am\r\ntherefore pleased that our Secretary-General and the\r\ncountries representing the United Nations have always\r\nresponded positively to the situations they have faced. I\r\nhope that they will continue to do this, even after such\r\ndistressing events as those which have occurred in Somalia\r\nthis week.\r\nI say this because the past year has seen so many\r\nvaluable achievements. The success of the United Nations\r\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia has shown what can be\r\ndone through responsible regional efforts and patient\r\nmultilateral action. In South Africa, national, regional and\r\ninternational efforts in support of United Nations resolutions\r\nhave brought new hope. In the Middle East, the United\r\nNations has been a positive influence in reducing tension\r\nafter the Gulf War.\r\nWe also welcome the agreement between the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and Israel. This is the first step\r\ntowards a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian question.\r\nThere have also been several initiatives aimed at\r\nimproving the world economy and developing better trading\r\narrangements in regions. At the same time, the United\r\nNations has continued to give essential assistance to people\r\nin developing countries. It has also maintained its peace-\r\nkeeping operations in a number of problem areas. The\r\nUnited Nations has also organized important international\r\nconferences where nations have been able to exchange views\r\non many matters of international concern. This represents\r\na considerable contribution to preventive diplomacy and\r\npeace-building. In each case, I hope these achievements will\r\nbe consolidated by national and regional authorities.\r\nIn Cambodia, we wish the new Government every\r\nsuccess as they go about the task of bringing lasting stability\r\nto their nation. Like all the countries in our region, we look\r\nforward to seeing the Cambodian people enjoying peace and\r\nprosperity again.\r\nIn South Africa, I believe conditions now exist for\r\nnational leaders to encourage restraint and seek consensus.\r\nThe countries in the Gulf region are also in a position\r\nto work towards peaceful solutions to the remaining areas of\r\ndifficulty.\r\nIn the Middle East, current developments should start\r\na process that will restore all legitimate Palestinian rights\r\nand should lead to a comprehensive settlement in the region.\r\nIn terms of the world economy, objectives have been\r\nset. What we hope to see now is equally clear progress in\r\nstrengthening linkages between the North and the South and\r\nin creating conditions that promote cooperation and\r\nsustainable growth. To do this, we need to improve the\r\nexisting mechanisms for preventing economic disagreements\r\nfrom turning into open conflict. Each nation has a\r\nresponsibility to promote fair trading arrangements\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nToday’s overall situation presents many challenges. I\r\nfeel that we can continue to turn them into positive\r\ndevelopments if we note carefully the circumstances under\r\nwhich the United Nations appears to achieve its greatest\r\nsuccesses. These occur when the special responsibilities of\r\nnational Governments, non-governmental organizations and\r\nregional associations are recognized and agreed upon before\r\nthe world body is asked to act.\r\nWhere those responsibilities have been in confrontation\r\nwith each other, the effectiveness of United Nations\r\noperations has been hindered. This is clearly illustrated in\r\nSomalia and in Bosnia. In those countries, the United\r\nNations initially acted in order to guarantee safe and\r\neffective humanitarian assistance. There have been\r\nconsiderable successes in these operations, and I thank those\r\nwho have achieved them for their humanitarian work.\r\nHowever, these efforts and the fact that conflict has not\r\nbeen allowed to spread outside the regions concerned should\r\nnot divert our attention from the deep matters of principle\r\ninvolved.\r\nThat is why we wish to express our strong support for\r\nthe Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believe\r\nthat the United Nations Charter would be severely\r\ncompromised if the Organization became a party to any\r\narrangement which forces a sovereign nation and fellow\r\nMember of the United Nations to submit to aggression. Not\r\nonly would this condone terrorism - it would reward it.\r\nIn seeking to ensure that the United Nations does not\r\nbecome merely another factor in a local political equation,\r\nthere are a number of proposals for reform. These are\r\nintended to give confidence to Members that United Nations\r\ndecisions reflect the widest possible spectrum of world\r\nopinion. If they also assist in solving the world body’s deep\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nfinancial problems, I see merit in considering them\r\nfavourably.\r\nWe all have our different views on how the United\r\nNations should best operate. Whatever they are, I hope we\r\nwill make every effort to encourage our regional and\r\nsubregional associations to play a crucial supporting role.\r\nIdeally, each region will be working on its own agenda for\r\npeace and development which will complement the work of\r\nthe world body. The more this is done, the more the United\r\nNations will be able to act in the way in which it is most\r\neffective - as the authority of last resort. In this way, I\r\nbelieve we can make considerable progress towards\r\nestablishing what the Secretary-General has described as a\r\nworkable international system.\r\nMr. NIASSE (Senegal) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe General Assembly’s annual convening in New York is\r\na world event which, each year, expresses the hope of\r\nnations and peoples to find common ground, through\r\ndialogue and joint effort, in order to live together their\r\nshared destiny. In a world that is becoming daily more\r\ndiverse and in which peoples are witness to so many\r\ncontradictions, is it not here and now, in close friendship and\r\nfraternal dialogue, that humanity, with its boundless\r\nintellectual and ethical potential, can embark on a process of\r\nself-examination and be reconciled with the universal\r\nconscience, which is also the foundation of our human\r\ncalling to live together and in harmony?\r\nIt is in that belief that the delegation of Senegal - which\r\nparticipated in your election, Mr. President, aware of your\r\nbrilliant political record and the outstanding role your\r\ncountry plays on the international scene - extends to you\r\nthrough me the warm congratulations of my country, our\r\npeople and its leaders. We have no doubt about your\r\nmastery of international practice, for we know that your vast\r\nexperience as a statesman will make it possible for you to\r\nconduct, with effectiveness, intelligence and skill the work\r\nof this session of the General Assembly. My best wishes\r\nare thus with you in your election and with the task you\r\nhave been called upon to accomplish, until September 1994,\r\nfrom this historic and lofty rostrum.\r\nYour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, former Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, guided the proceedings of\r\nthe forty-seventh session of our General Assembly with a\r\ncompetence and effectiveness that deserve our appreciation\r\nand gratitude. We wish heartily to congratulate him.\r\nI should like to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the enormous\r\nenergy that he has expended with such foresight and courage\r\nto ensure the implementation of the principles and the\r\nrealization of the objectives of the Charter of our\r\nOrganization. The personal friendship that I have shared\r\nwith that eminent citizen of the world for almost 25 years\r\nallows me to reiterate the esteem and admiration that I have\r\nalways felt towards him.\r\nFinally, I should like to extend my country’s\r\ncongratulations to all the new States Members of our\r\nOrganization - the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, the\r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Principality of\r\nMonaco, the Principality of Andorra and Eritrea. I welcome\r\nall of them to the United Nations family.\r\nSome 15 years ago, in September 1978, I had the\r\nhonour for the first time, in my capacity as the new Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Senegal, to address this Assembly.\r\nAs the young head of the diplomatic corps of an African\r\ncountry, I referred to the many problems then confronting\r\nthe international community and which revolved around two\r\nbasic focal points.\r\nThe first of these was the accession to political\r\nsovereignty of peoples that had not yet experienced freedom,\r\nthat had been denied the full exercise of inalienable rights\r\ninherent to every human being on Earth. Those rights had\r\nbeen denied them by other men, other peoples, other States\r\nand other nations in the name of a system that was imposed\r\non them and to which they had been subjected. Hope in\r\ntheir fellow man was their only defence.\r\nThe other focal point of attention was the grave\r\ninequality of conditions for the economic, social, human and\r\ncultural development of nations. Some of these nations had\r\nnear-total control of scientific developments, industrial\r\ntechnology, transport and communications, the cultural media\r\nand world trade networks. They even controlled the raw\r\nmaterials that were produced, to a great extent, in the\r\nunderdeveloped regions.\r\nMrs. Fréchette (Canada), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nAt the same time, while the prices of these raw\r\nmaterials were falling year after year at a dizzying pace,\r\nother nations were forced to buy at a high price and with\r\nreduced resources the consumer goods produced in the\r\nindustrialized countries. Those nations were devoting all of\r\ntheir export income to these transactions and were therefore\r\nunable to invest in order to ensure their own development.\r\nThus doomed to indebtedness, they lost a significant part of\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 9\r\ntheir own sovereignty just as they were taking their first\r\ntentative steps onto the international scene.\r\nAnd here we are today, 15 years later, gathered together\r\nto evaluate, in an outpouring of solidarity, the distance we\r\nhave covered.\r\nThe fact is that the world has changed - yes, it has\r\nchanged - and the transformations that characterize this end\r\nof the twentieth century are so profound that the\r\ninternational community at large feels the need to reform\r\nradically the way the United Nations functions, as regards,\r\nparticularly, the composition of the Security Council, the\r\nfinancial management of the United Nations and cooperation\r\nfor development, to mention just a few of the most acute\r\nneeds of the present day.\r\nThe world has changed. As for the African continent -\r\nto take this as a point of reference - most of the peoples\r\nformerly under foreign domination have acceded to\r\nindependence. States have been created; the structures of an\r\neconomy have been established; and political and economic\r\nleaders have been trained and set to work to help these\r\npeoples fulfil their destinies.\r\nBut inequalities remain, even though an unprecedented\r\nglobal crisis today affects the economies of all countries,\r\nincluding even those of the most highly industrialized\r\nnations. The world economy seems to have become\r\ndislocated. It has lost its balance. New rules are established\r\nand developed day by day in the quest for new balances and\r\nnew solutions. And all this is done in a situation that\r\nincreasingly jeopardizes international peace. This situation\r\ncould, if we are not careful, lead to impatience, to\r\nintolerance, to irritation, to a lack of dialogue - in short, to\r\ninevitable confrontation. Such a threat is unacceptable, and\r\nwe must not accept it.\r\nThat is why, together with my colleagues the other\r\nheads of delegations, I would like on behalf of my country -\r\nan African country, a Sahelian country, a developing country\r\n- to join other delegations in repeating to the nations\r\ngathered here that, in spite of all these problems, we do not\r\nhave the right to despair.\r\nFor it is obvious today that the salvation of humankind\r\nresides in solidarity and in friendship and cooperation\r\nbetween human beings. The fundamental and logical\r\nunderpinnings of relations between peoples are, more than\r\never before, dialogue and agreement, expressed through firm\r\nlanguage that translates our thoughts about the human being\r\nand about life.\r\nIt is fortunate that a country such as France - which I\r\nam pleased to mention, together with other industrialized\r\ncountries that are supporting Africa - reaffirmed just a few\r\ndays ago in Paris, through Mr. Alain Juppé, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, that the West in general and the European\r\ncountries in particular must be aware that if the majority of\r\nthe populations of the world remain hungry, poor, bearing\r\nthe weight of the distortions in the international economy,\r\nand if, in addition, they see their efforts to achieve political\r\nand social democracy destroyed by difficulties of all types,\r\nthen there will always be a risk that international peace will\r\nbe destabilized.\r\nThe industrialized countries must move in the right\r\ndirection. They must understand that international solidarity\r\ncan be expressed only through the mutual support that\r\nnations must give each other. In this respect, our continent,\r\nAfrica, and many Asian countries should receive this support\r\nin a context of mutual respect. In other words, the proposal\r\nfor an \"agenda for development\" initiated by the Brazilian\r\ndelegation, with the support of the Group of 77, to\r\naccompany the \"Agenda for Peace\" submitted by our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, deserves the\r\ninternational community’s attention. This important measure\r\nreflects the concerns of the Head of State of Senegal,\r\nPresident Abdou Diouf, who, when he addressed this\r\nAssembly last year, on this very date, launched the idea of\r\na general agreement on solidarity as the foundation for\r\nfruitful international economic cooperation, the driving force\r\nof North-South solidarity in a renewed form.\r\nAncient African wisdom - the ancient wisdom of our\r\ncontinent -teaches us that human beings, who alone can\r\nchange and improve their own environment, are endowed\r\nwith prodigious intellectual and moral resources, resources\r\nbased on intelligence, imagination and the ability to rise to\r\na situation in a way that makes it possible for them to fulfil\r\ntheir destiny. We must remain united and mutually\r\nsupportive.\r\nIn this connection, the delegation of Senegal solemnly\r\ncommends the international community for the efforts that\r\nmade possible the signing in Washington on\r\n13 September 1993 of the agreement between the State of\r\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization. This\r\nhistoric event put an end to many decades of hostility and\r\nrancour, which cost thousands of lives and left many\r\nwounded and many alone, orphaned or widowed - all\r\nbecause of a lack of understanding which itself led to the\r\ndestruction of the conditions for development in the Middle\r\nEastern countries as a whole. And, what is more, there was\r\nthe flare-up in oil prices which began in October 1973 and\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nwhich led to the inflationary curves that have since then\r\ncharacterized the global economy everywhere in the world.\r\nIt is now up to the international community to work to\r\nconsolidate this important step in the direction of a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. In this endeavour,\r\nthe United Nations family can rely, as in the past, on the\r\nconstant and active support of my country to ensure that in\r\nthat holy land Israelis and Palestinians can bring humankind\r\ninto harmony with its profound values of tolerance, wisdom\r\nand concord.\r\nThat is also the way we view the efforts made to\r\nresolve conflicts that in the past seemed beyond any human\r\nsolution. I have in mind, inter alia, Cambodia, where the\r\nsettlement plan designed by the United Nations led to the\r\nholding in May 1993 of general, orderly and democratic\r\nelections, as a result of which a legitimate Government was\r\nestablished; El Salvador, where, after several years of civil\r\nwar, negotiations conducted under the auspices of the United\r\nNations led to the signing, at the beginning of last year, of\r\nthe Mexico Agreement, which initiated a period of transition\r\ntowards general elections planned for the beginning of 1994;\r\nLiberia, where repeated initiatives pursued by the members\r\nof the Economic Community of West African States,\r\nsupported by the United Nations and by the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, made it possible to conclude, in July 1993, a\r\nnew peace agreement which should, as we fervently hope,\r\nlead to a definitive settlement of that fratricidal conflict; and\r\nMozambique and Rwanda, where similar agreements have\r\nbeen concluded and where the United Nations has been\r\nmeaningfully involved in their practical and complete\r\nimplementation.\r\nI also have in mind South Africa, where considerable\r\nprogress has been made toward eliminating a system which\r\nthe entire world rejected and condemned, and where peoples,\r\nunited in fruitful diversity, must work together for the\r\nemergence of a human community characterized by justice\r\nand equality. My country, Senegal, will respond to the\r\nappeal made in this Hall a few days ago by President Nelson\r\nMandela, when, from this very rostrum, he invited the\r\ninternational community to take a new approach consistent\r\nwith the evolution of the situation in his country.\r\nAll of these are excellent examples of the fact that\r\nthese new times bear new hopes, even though we still have\r\ngrounds for legitimate concern. In fact, despite the victories\r\nthat freedom has won, when peoples are liberated peace is\r\nnot always the result. The legacy of the collapsing old order\r\nis in fact often an unwieldy one, difficult to manage. On the\r\nruins of oppression which lasted for far too long we must\r\nbuild a new world, a world of freedom and peace, of justice\r\nand progress.\r\nDuring this uncertain period of transition, border\r\nconflicts, problems between neighbours and religious\r\ntensions bring a return to the conflicts - civil war, genocide,\r\nrivalry among members of the same national community - of\r\nan era we thought past. Yugoslavia, Somalia, Angola:\r\nthere are many examples that show that universal peace, that\r\nprimary objective of the United Nations, is yet but an\r\naspiration.\r\nThe challenge, therefore, is to do all in our power so\r\nthat in all parts of the world the freedoms regained will open\r\nthe way to peace. My country, Senegal, which has always\r\nand in every way been committed to strengthening peace and\r\npromoting security, feels that working towards this objective\r\nmeans, first and foremost, affirming forcefully the rule of\r\nlaw in international relations. Lasting peace and security, in\r\nfact, can be guaranteed only if all nations of the world\r\ncomply with the rule of law in their relations with other\r\nnations. That law must be the same for all if justice is to\r\nprevail.\r\nIn this context, and in connection with the tragedy of\r\nthe fraternal people of Kuwait, I welcome the happy\r\nconclusions that have been reached by the Iraq-Kuwait\r\nBoundary Demarcation Commission. The international\r\ncommunity must continue to protect all States from any\r\nexternal threat to their independence and sovereignty.\r\nMy thoughts turn also to Bosnia and Herzegovina, a\r\nmartyred State and a State Member of the United Nations.\r\nI believe the international community has endeavoured in\r\nevery stage of the evolution of the situation in the former\r\nYugoslavia to guarantee the territorial integrity and\r\nsovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the international\r\ncommunity has committed itself to enforcing, above all, the\r\nrights of the Bosnian people, a people today undeniably the\r\nvictim of true genocide. This commitment must be\r\nrespected because the very credibility of our Organization is\r\nat stake.\r\nIn any event, it is in order to uphold respect for that\r\ncommitment that my country, whose Head of State is\r\nChairman of the Sixth Islamic Summit Conference, intends\r\nto continue the efforts he has already begun to contribute to\r\nthe promotion of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in close\r\ncooperation with all countries that cherish the same ideals of\r\npeace and justice.\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 11\r\nI also have in mind the painful situation prevailing in\r\nAngola. The Bicesse Accords, although freely entered into\r\nby the parties to the conflict, seem today to have collapsed.\r\nBy calling into question the validity of the elections\r\norganized a year ago under those same Bicesse Accords,\r\nUNITA has once again plunged Angola into an atmosphere\r\nfraught with danger and uncertainty. The magnitude of the\r\ndestruction and suffering caused by this situation warrants\r\nurgent efforts to arrive at a definitive cease-fire and a\r\nresumption of negotiations. The framework already exists:\r\nthe Bicesse Accords, endorsed by the United Nations. The\r\nprinciples on which any solution to the conflict must be\r\nbased are also very clear: the safeguarding of Angola’s\r\nterritorial integrity and national unity and also, above all,\r\nrespect for the will of the Angolan people, freely expressed\r\nin the elections a year ago.\r\nOn these bases, my country would here like to send out\r\na solemn appeal to all our Angolan brothers and sisters,\r\nabove all those of UNITA, to understand that it is not in the\r\ninterests of the Angolan people to continue the fighting. The\r\ninterests of the Angolan people reside exclusively in the\r\nnational effort that all must make to restore peace and\r\nharmony to Angola. We Senegalese, for our part, support all\r\nefforts to help them in this regard.\r\nThere is also the situation in Somalia, where a great\r\ndeal remains to be done to restore peace and organize a\r\nviable State. The United Nations there is on the right path,\r\nconducting the most ambitious and largest operation ever\r\norganized in Africa. My country would like to express its\r\npleasure once again over the organization of this operation\r\nin a country that is today experiencing a tragic and complex\r\nsituation. The infrastructure has been devastated, the State\r\nhas collapsed and fratricidal internal strife has engendered\r\nmassive displacements of the population.\r\nIn the face of this tragic situation and in support of the\r\nAddis Ababa Agreement, which was the result on last 28\r\nMarch of the Conference on National Reconciliation in\r\nSomalia, the international community, through the United\r\nNations, gave the United Nations Operation in Somalia\r\n(UNOSOM II) a mandate to continue the disarmament and\r\nto work towards national reconciliation, and at the same\r\ntime, and most important, towards the strengthening of\r\npolitical institutions.\r\nWe are pleased to note that today, in spite of the\r\nsporadic turmoil of recent months, UNOSOM II has begun\r\nto help the Somali people restore the sovereignty and\r\nintegrity of the State. It is in Somalia’s and the whole\r\ninternational community’s interests for this mission to\r\ncontinue and that it achieve the desired results.\r\nI wish at this point to conclude my statement on a\r\nhopeful note.\r\nThere is a clear awareness today that our planetary\r\ncommunity is inextricably interrelated, that it rests on a\r\nnatural unity based on scientific and medical discoveries and\r\nthe speed of communications. But despite, and perhaps\r\nbecause of, this very progress there remains a certain\r\nfragility in the balance of our world.\r\nOur calling as human beings endowed with reason is\r\ntherefore to remain united and to ensure together, hand in\r\nhand, the survival of humankind. It is our duty to see to it\r\nthat our populations live long and in good health, to see to\r\nit that future generations derive the greatest benefit from the\r\nexperiences we have had and that we are having now, so\r\nthat, tomorrow, our legacy to them will be a world that has\r\nnot been destroyed, a generous nature, a land united on the\r\nsolid foundations of friendship, brotherhood, love and peace.\r\nMr. PHAN VAN Khai (Viet Nam) (spoke in\r\nVietnamese; English text furnished by the delegation): On\r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet\r\nNam, I should like to extend to Ambassador Insanally warm\r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of this\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe regard highly the vast efforts made and positive\r\nachievements attained by His Excellency the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his\r\nposition of lofty responsibility, towards the cause of peace,\r\ninternational security, development and cooperation among\r\nnations. In April of this year it was with warmth and high\r\nesteem, and moved by a desire to enhance Viet Nam’s\r\ncooperation with the United Nations, that our Government\r\nand people welcomed the Secretary-General in our country.\r\nWe wish to congratulate the new Members of our\r\nUnited Nations family.\r\nIn the year since the previous session of our General\r\nAssembly, the world has offered us a chiaroscuro picture of\r\nopportunities intermingled with challenges, of hopes mixed\r\nwith anxieties. The threat of a global war of annihilation\r\ncontinues to recede, and we are witnessing an increasing\r\ntrend towards dialogue and cooperation, in new forms and\r\nthrough new mechanisms, in different regions and on a\r\nworld-wide scale. The progress towards restoration of peace\r\nin a number of places, especially in Cambodia and the\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMiddle East, brings glad tidings to the whole world and\r\ndemonstrates that in our day and age it is still possible,\r\nthrough peaceful negotiations, to settle conflicts that were\r\nonce fierce and protracted.\r\nHowever, humanity’s conscience and reason remain\r\nprofoundly disturbed by the bloody conflicts which are\r\ninflicting death and pain on peoples and provoking regional\r\nand international instability, by potentially explosive\r\ntendencies to increase armaments in certain parts of the\r\nworld, by the widening gap between the developed and the\r\ndeveloping world and by other important and pressing\r\nproblems of a global nature, such as demographic explosion,\r\nenvironmental degradation, dangerous diseases, transnational\r\ncrime, and so on.\r\nIn an unstable world whose evolution is fraught with\r\ncomplexities, the United Nations, while taking account of the\r\ndirect responsibility of nations concerned, is facing major\r\nchallenges in the discharge of its primary responsibility,\r\nnamely the restoration and preservation of peace and\r\nstability. Never before has the United Nations been present\r\nand active in so many hot spots across the continents as it is\r\ntoday. In this regard the Secretary-General has given us a\r\ncomprehensive approach to the problem in his report \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\". (A/47/277)\r\nIt is the earnest desire of the people of Viet Nam that\r\npeace, closely linked with national independence and\r\nsovereignty, be primary components of the new world order.\r\nWe endorse the view expressed in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/48/1)\r\nthat\r\n\"States and their sovereignty are increasingly\r\nrecognized as indispensable building-blocks of\r\ninternational order and problem-solving\". (A/48/1,\r\npara. 13)\r\nRespect for the national independence, sovereignty and\r\nidentity of each country, the strengthening of international\r\ncooperation, and the settlement of disputes through peaceful\r\nnegotiations and mutual accommodation, considering peace,\r\nstability and cooperation to be the fundamental, long-term\r\ninterest of each State and of the international community:\r\nall these are guiding principles in inter-State relations,\r\nprinciples that the United Nations and its Member States\r\nmust respect. The Security Council is vested with the\r\nprimary responsibility for the activities of the United Nations\r\nin respect of the restoration and safeguarding of peace. This\r\nmission, however, devolves not solely on the Security\r\nCouncil but on all nations. Member States should therefore\r\nhave a say in determining the objectives and guiding\r\nprinciples for decisions and actions undertaken by the\r\nSecurity Council with regard to international peace and\r\nsecurity. Only by so doing can the United Nations truly be\r\na universal Organization and a common instrument for the\r\ncommunity of nation-States. The principles of respect for\r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, of\r\nnon-coercion and non-interference in the internal affairs of\r\nStates, of attainment of the consent of the parties concerned,\r\nand perseverance in the settlement of disputes through\r\npeaceful negotiations: such are the principles that should\r\ngovern the Security Council’s decisions.\r\nToday the world is witnessing miraculous advances in\r\nscience and technology. In that world, however, some\r\nhundred countries and with them billions of human beings\r\nare in danger of falling behind in the general advancement\r\nof mankind, while the wealth and property of the world are\r\nconcentrated in the hands of a few developed countries. The\r\ngap in development levels is steadily widening. This,\r\ntogether with the accumulated external debt burden, has put\r\ndeveloping countries at a constant disadvantage in\r\nNorth-South economic and trade relations. This reality\r\ncarries potential challenges to security and stability, both\r\nregional and international. We should therefore fully\r\ncomprehend, now more than ever, the interrelation between\r\npeace, security and development.\r\nWe support the proposal for the United Nations to work\r\nout a comprehensive and effective \"agenda for\r\ndevelopment\", considering the implementation of such an\r\nagenda through enhanced resources as a fundamental factor\r\nfor the establishment of a new, sound and equitable world\r\norder. Development programmes of the United Nations and\r\nassistance from highly developed countries to developing\r\ncountries, especially poor countries, are undertakings which\r\ndo not benefit one side only; rather, they are necessary for\r\nthe overall stability and development of the world and the\r\nvarious regions as well as of each State. We are of the view\r\nthat attaching political conditions to development assistance\r\nand cooperation runs counter to the principle of equality and\r\nmutual benefit of wholesome international relations.\r\nOn the other hand, poor countries hope that the rapidly\r\nincreasing cost of peace-keeping operations will not affect\r\nthe ability of the United Nations in the field of development\r\ncooperation, and they wish to see balanced attention on the\r\npart of the United Nations to both the Agenda for Peace and\r\nthat for development.\r\nOne important direction of the United Nations activities\r\nthat reflect the broadening attention given in this regard by\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 13\r\nthe international community is the promotion of democracy\r\nand human rights. The World Conference on Human Rights\r\nheld in Vienna last June clearly pointed out the close\r\nrelationship between democracy and human rights. In our\r\nview, one should accord equal importance to, and promote\r\nconcurrently, democracy within each country and democracy\r\nin inter-State relations. Respect for human rights must go\r\ntogether with respect for equality among States as well as\r\nbetween the United Nations and Member States. The United\r\nNations itself needs to reform its organization and mode of\r\noperation so as to ensure democracy, justice and equality for\r\nall Member States.\r\nAn enlargement in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil to enhance its representativeness, the promotion of\r\ngreater transparency in the work of this body of authority\r\nwithin the United Nations system, the strengthening of the\r\neffectiveness of the General Assembly, the improvement of\r\nthe relationship among the United Nations organs, together\r\nwith perfecting the mechanisms and streamlining the\r\nmachinery to ensure better efficiency and effectiveness of\r\nthe United Nations activities - all these are urgent demands\r\nfacing us as we are approaching the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthis Organization. Together with many other countries -\r\nmember States of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries,\r\nin particular - Viet Nam considers human rights to be\r\nprimarily the concern and interest of each country, the\r\npursuit of democracy and human rights in one country to be,\r\nfirst and essentially, the responsibility of that country and\r\nnation. At the same time, States may cooperate with one\r\nanother in the promotion of democracy and human rights on\r\nthe basis of respect for national independence and\r\nsovereignty, the right to self-determination, the right of a\r\nnation to choose its own path of development, in accordance\r\nwith the purposes and principles set forth in the United\r\nNations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nand the two basic International Covenants on Human Rights.\r\nWe consider using imposed standards of human rights and\r\ndemocracy as preconditions for inter-State cooperation to be\r\na manifestation of inequality and lack of democracy in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe Vienna Conference identified areas of agreement\r\nand at the same time revealed outstanding differences of\r\nviews on human rights. We hope that, proceeding from the\r\ncommitment to the common cause of human rights\r\nprotection and promotion, from the recognition of both the\r\nuniversality and the specificity of human rights, countries\r\nwill engage in a dialogue in a spirit of mutual respect with\r\na view to achieving a unity of purpose in a diversity of ways\r\nand means of implementation in the field of human rights.\r\nThe Vienna Conference also put forth recommendations\r\naimed at consolidating and strengthening the role and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations in regard to human\r\nrights. To achieve this end, it is our view that we should\r\nmake full use of the relevant existing machinery and\r\nmechanisms of the United Nations and enhance their\r\nefficiency and effectiveness. Taking account of the need to\r\nstreamline its machinery, the Organization must carefully\r\nscrutinize and weigh any initiative for the establishment of\r\nnew mechanisms.\r\nViet Nam is a country that has lived through protracted,\r\ndevastating wars in which the use of millions of tons of\r\nbombs, ammunition and toxic chemicals has caused\r\ndestruction of the environment, misery, loss of life and\r\nserious consequences for several generations now. It has\r\nbeen undertaking a process of renewal, overcoming many\r\ndifficulties and challenges to achieve stability, development\r\nand integration into the international community.\r\nLocated in the most dynamic region for development in\r\nthe world, Viet Nam has both assets and difficulties,\r\nopportunities and challenges stemming from its specific\r\nhistorical circumstances, natural conditions and its\r\ngeopolitical and geoeconomic position. We are now facing\r\nthe acute challenge of how to overcome, soon, our state of\r\npoverty and underdevelopment, and join the mainstream of\r\nprogress in the region. The only way is to tap all domestic\r\nresources, which, first and foremost, means bringing into full\r\nplay the dynamism and creativity of every Vietnamese, and\r\nat the same time expanding international cooperation in\r\nfriendship with all countries based on the principle of mutual\r\nrespect for national independence and sovereignty, and on\r\nequality and mutual benefit.\r\nThis imperative need impels us to initiate and step up\r\nefforts towards renewal in every sphere of social life; at its\r\ncore, this is focused on a market economy and on perfecting\r\nthe rule of law in a State that is truly of the people, by the\r\npeople and for the people.\r\nThe process of renewal focuses on the economic field\r\nwith a view to developing a multisectoral economy operating\r\nunder the market mechanism, to establishing an economic\r\nsystem that is open both domestically and externally, and to\r\nimproving the functions and management patterns of the\r\nState. Under embargo conditions, and at a point where\r\nsources of major assistance from the countries of the Council\r\nfor Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) are no longer\r\navailable, the renewal process has helped Viet Nam’s\r\neconomy overcome the most difficult hurdle and end the\r\nrecession, reduce and maintain control over inflation, achieve\r\naverage growth in gross domestic product of 7.2 per cent\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nduring the past three years, 1991 to 1993, accumulate\r\ninitially modest levels of domestic savings, and gradually\r\nimprove the life of the people.\r\nViet Nam has been attracting increasing foreign direct\r\ninvestment and development assistance. On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Viet Nam, I should like to\r\nexpress our sincere thanks to various agencies of the United\r\nNations system, such as the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United\r\nNations Population Fund, the World Food Programme, the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,\r\nthe World Health Organization, the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization, the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific and others, as well as\r\nmany Governments and non-governmental organizations in\r\nthe world, for maintaining, resuming and increasing\r\ndevelopment and humanitarian assistance to Viet Nam.\r\nWe highly appreciate the timely support extended by\r\nthe Governments of France, Japan, Sweden and other\r\ncountries, together with the international financial\r\ninstitutions, for helping Viet Nam settle arrears with the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, thereby creating a\r\nbreakthrough initiation of credit assistance from international\r\nmonetary and financial institutions; such assistance is\r\nabsolutely essential for building up socio-economic\r\ninfrastructures in Viet Nam.\r\nOur appreciation goes also to the many companies,\r\nfrom nearly 50 countries, that have come to Viet Nam for\r\ninvestment and business cooperation at this initial stage of\r\nour development.\r\nIn our journey towards a dynamic and sound market\r\neconomy that is well-managed at the macroeconomic level,\r\nand achieving healthy, rapid and sustainable growth aimed\r\nat achieving the objectives of a prosperous nation, a strong\r\ncountry and a civilized and equitable society, we still face\r\nnumerous difficulties, weaknesses and challenges. At this\r\njuncture, increased assistance from the United Nations,\r\ninternational financial institutions and non-governmental\r\norganizations, as well as cooperation and support from\r\nvarious countries, is extremely valuable and meaningful.\r\nOn the basis of the fundamental approach of having a\r\nsocio-economic development strategy up to the year 2000 in\r\nwhich the human person constitutes both the end and the\r\ndriving force, Viet Nam is simultaneously carrying out\r\neconomic reforms and a step-by-step renovation of the\r\npolitical system in order to promote the rights of people and\r\ncitizens’ rights, both economic and political, cultural and\r\nsocial. Strenuous efforts have been made to establish the\r\nState’s rule of law through the promulgation of the amended\r\nConstitution of 1992, the election of the new National\r\nAssembly Legislature, an enhancement of the power and\r\nresponsibilities of the elected organs and a stepping up of\r\nthe law-making process.\r\nIn accordance with our nation’s tradition of\r\nhumaneness, we stand for abolishing prejudice and\r\nvengeance, and for looking towards the future. Those\r\npreviously in the ranks of our adversaries have all been freed\r\nand given full citizens’ rights. All Vietnamese who wish for\r\na prosperous and strong Viet Nam, and who respect the\r\nlaws, will find a place in the great unity of the nation, even\r\nif they are of different political opinions.\r\nThe process of renovation and the policy of universal\r\nnational unity constitute the prime mover for development in\r\nthe country and at the same time bring into full play the\r\npotential of Vietnamese overseas to contribute to the\r\nconstruction of their former homeland.\r\nViet Nam has concurrently deployed a foreign policy of\r\nopenness, diversifying and multilateralizing its relations of\r\nfriendly cooperation with all other countries, thus creating a\r\nfavourable international environment for our country’s\r\nrenovation and development.\r\nIn that spirit, Viet Nam has actively contributed to the\r\npeaceful solution of the Cambodian question and has\r\nimplemented the Paris Agreements and cooperated with the\r\nUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. We\r\nhave established relations of good-neighbourliness with\r\nCambodia in the hope that Cambodia will become a country\r\nof peace, independence, neutrality and non-alignment that\r\nentertains friendly relations with other countries.\r\nWe wish to congratulate the new Government in\r\nCambodia, and stand ready, together with that Government,\r\nto settle, jointly, any questions of mutual concern. We\r\nexpress the wish that the Cambodian Government and the\r\nUnited Nations will take effective measures to protect\r\nVietnamese residents living peacefully in Cambodia, and to\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 15\r\nensure their safety and the same rights and benefits as are\r\nenjoyed by people from other countries who are resident in\r\nCambodia.\r\nViet Nam is sparing no effort in building up friendship\r\nand cooperation with neighbouring countries and is\r\npersevering in its policy of peaceful negotiations to find\r\nsatisfactory solutions to border and territorial disputes at sea\r\nas well as on land. While working for solutions, all\r\nconcerned parties should refrain from doing anything that\r\nfurther complicates the situation and from the use or threat\r\nof use of force to settle disputes.\r\nThe fact that relations between the United States and\r\nViet Nam have not yet been normalized 20 years after the\r\nend of the war is not normal nor is it in consonance with the\r\ntrend of our time. With the desire to close the book on the\r\npast and to look to the future, Viet Nam wishes and stands\r\nready to normalize relations with the United States on the\r\nbasis of equality and mutual respect and without\r\npreconditions. This would meet the aspirations and interests\r\nof the peoples of the two countries, and would serve peace,\r\nstability, cooperation and development in the region and\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nViet Nam still has tens of thousands of people missing\r\nsince the war, and their remains have yet to be found; and\r\nmillions of war victims need help. We are deeply\r\nsympathetic towards the sentiments of American families\r\nwhose loved ones went missing in the Viet Nam war, and\r\nhave cooperated, are cooperating and will continue to\r\ncooperate actively with the American Government and\r\npeople on the missing-in-action question. We consider this\r\na purely humanitarian issue.\r\nI am confident that the goodwill and conscience of the\r\nAmerican and Vietnamese peoples, together with the\r\nimmediate and long-term interests of the two countries, will\r\nsoon prevail over the existing obstacles so that relations\r\nbetween the two countries can be normalized.\r\nAllow me to conclude my statement with the hope that\r\nthe United Nations will rise to the challenge of seizing the\r\nopportunities and surmounting the challenges so that it truly\r\nbecomes an institution to which all Member States entrust\r\ntheir aspirations and in which their views are heard and their\r\nactions coordinated. For its part, Viet Nam, in its efforts\r\ntowards renewal, development and integration with the\r\ninternational community, will always be a positive factor for\r\npeace, national independence and social progress, and a\r\nsincere and reliable cooperation partner in the region as well\r\nas in the world.\r\nMr. SEY (Gambia): May I at the outset congratulate\r\nAmbassador Insanally on his unanimous election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nHis long and rich experience makes him suitably qualified\r\nto preside over this session. I can assure him that he will\r\nenjoy the full support and cooperation of my delegation in\r\ncarrying out his mission.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend to\r\nhis predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\r\nBulgaria, my heartfelt congratulations on the efficient\r\nmanner in which he presided over the General Assembly at\r\nits forty-seventh session.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to pay a special\r\ntribute, once again, to our Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the high quality of leadership\r\nhe is providing to our Organization.\r\nIt is encouraging to note the growing membership of\r\nthe United Nations each year. It is, in the words of the\r\nSecretary-General, an explosion in United Nations member-\r\nship. I should like to extend, on behalf of the Gambia and\r\non my own behalf, sincere congratulations to Eritrea, the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra and the Principality of Monaco on\r\ntheir admission as Members of the United Nations. It is our\r\nfervent hope that they will not only be able to realize their\r\nnational aspirations but also contribute to the positive\r\nfulfilment of mankind’s hope for a better world.\r\nIt was with deep shock and sorrow that we learned of\r\nthe devastating earthquake in parts of India. In this\r\nconnection, I should like to convey the heartfelt condolences\r\nof the Government of the Gambia to the Government of\r\nIndia and the members of the bereaved families on the\r\noccasion of this catastrophe. We also commend the laudable\r\nefforts of the Government of India in coping with this\r\nmassive disaster.\r\nWe are meeting this year against the background of\r\nrenewed hope, following the significant developments in the\r\nMiddle East and South Africa. Until recently, the Middle -\r\nEast crisis and the situation in South Africa posed a real\r\nthreat to international peace and security. Today, however,\r\nit can be said with a high degree of certainty that in both\r\ncases the peace process is irreversible.\r\nThe other notable event of major international\r\nsignificance has been the World Conference on Human\r\nRights held in Vienna last June. Coming soon after the end\r\nof the cold war and 25 years after the first International\r\nConference on Human Rights, this year’s World Conference\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\non Human Rights reflected the hopes and aspirations of\r\nteeming millions of human beings seeking new solutions,\r\nreadjustments, changes and improvements to their conditions.\r\nIn many ways, the World Conference on Human Rights\r\nsymbolized the end of one era and the beginning of a new\r\none with regard to the promotion and consolidation of a\r\nstrong human-rights culture world-wide.\r\nFor us in the Gambia, the convening of the World\r\nConference on Human Rights was a refreshing experience,\r\ngiven our long-established tradition in the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights. The Conference enabled us to\r\nstrengthen our resolve to continue to uphold these much-\r\ncherished values.\r\nIn reviewing the outcome of the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights, my delegation is pleased with the adoption\r\nof the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which\r\nwill serve as a human-rights blueprint for the next century.\r\nI would urge the Assembly to consider and approve the\r\ndocument. We regret, however, the failure of the\r\nConference to agree on the setting up of the office of high\r\ncommissioner for human rights. My Government continues\r\nto give its strong support to this proposal, as we are\r\nconvinced that the office, if created, would facilitate greater\r\ncoordination of United Nations efforts and provide a more\r\nprompt and effective response to critical cases of gross\r\nviolations.\r\nThe issue of human rights, however, needs to be\r\naddressed fully in all its composite parts. Political and civil\r\nrights go hand in hand with economic, social and cultural\r\nrights. Such problems as poverty, hunger, and illiteracy that\r\nhave characterized developing countries constitute a serious\r\nthreat to stability and respect for political rights in these\r\ncountries. As my President, Sir Dawda Jawara stated at the\r\nConference in Vienna in respect of political rights and the\r\nright to development,\r\n\"We need to remind ourselves of the indivisibility and\r\nthe interdependence of both rights and the necessity of\r\ngiving equal attention and urgent consideration to both\".\r\nIt is saddening to note that at a time when such\r\ninternationally recognized values as democracy, human rights\r\nand rule of law are becoming the order of the day almost\r\neverywhere, some seemingly intractable conflicts in other\r\nparts of the world threaten to turn back the hands of time.\r\nThe situation in Somalia, which appeared to have\r\nimproved only about a year ago, has suddenly deteriorated,\r\ngenerating cause for serious concern. My delegation is\r\nparticularly alarmed by the dramatic turn of events resulting\r\nin the deaths of some members of the United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping force and also of some Somalis. To the families of\r\nall these fallen servicemen and those of other innocent\r\nvictims of the Somali conflict, we extend our heartfelt\r\ncondolences. We very much regret these unfortunate\r\nincidents, but they should, no matter how tragic, neither\r\ndampen the enthusiasm nor weaken the resolve of the\r\ninternational community to assist the Somalis in their search\r\nfor lasting peace and stability. Let us not forget now, in the\r\nheat of the moment, the very positive achievements of the\r\nintervention, which has made it possible to distribute food\r\namong a population that was suffering from one of the most\r\nhorrendous forms of famine.\r\nIn the present circumstances the need for general and\r\ncomplete disarmament of all factions cannot be\r\noveremphasized, and this must be pursued with renewed\r\nvigour. I should like to appeal to the United Nations and, in\r\nparticular, to the United States of America and all those\r\nother countries that have agreed to send troops to Somalia to\r\ncontinue their assistance so that peace and security can\r\nreturn to this troubled land.\r\nWe call on all the parties to the conflict to cooperate\r\nfully, to respect all the relevant Security Council resolutions\r\nand to implement without any further delay the Addis Ababa\r\naccord aimed at achieving national reconciliation.\r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina also\r\nconstitutes a major preoccupation of the international\r\ncommunity. Recent efforts to establish a credible and lasting\r\npeace in the country have yet to bear fruit. The failure, so\r\nfar, to resolve the conflict and the persistent disregard of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions - in particular, resolution 713 (1991) -\r\nmake the situation even more desperate. The Gambia\r\ndeplores the continued Serbian aggression against the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It deplores the\r\nacquisition of territory by force, by means of the heinous\r\npractice of \"ethnic cleansing\" and other war crimes. My\r\ndelegation is firmly of the view that if the international\r\ncommunity is unwilling or unable to protect the defenceless\r\nMuslim population against Serbian aggression, it must be\r\ngiven the opportunity to defend itself in accordance with\r\nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter, which recognizes\r\nthat peoples must be able to exercise their right of\r\nself-defence. We welcome the establishment of an\r\ninternational war crimes tribunal as a fitting response to the\r\natrocities perpetrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nIn Angola, the fighting continues with unprecedented\r\nintensity and ferocity. We condemn the naked and brutal\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 17\r\naggression by UNITA against the Government and people of\r\nAngola. The people of Angola, through the democratic\r\nprocess - whose principles are the very ones we have been\r\nproclaiming in this Hall - have given their verdict. Their\r\ndecision must be respected, and the international community\r\nshould provide all necessary support for action against any\r\nforce that seeks to disregard or overturn it. We therefore\r\nwelcome the recent decision of the Security Council to\r\nimpose sanctions on UNITA.\r\nThis year - 1993 - has not been one just of conflict,\r\nturmoil and bloodshed. Very notable successes have been\r\nachieved in mankind’s search for peace, and these augur\r\nwell for the future.\r\nWith the conclusion of the Cotonou Peace Accord and\r\nthe installation of a five-man Council of State to lead Liberia\r\nto democratic elections after six months, there is renewed\r\nhope of a peaceful and lasting solution to the Liberian\r\nconflict. We welcome the contribution of the Government\r\nof the United States of America to the United Nations Trust\r\nFund, and we call on all other donor countries to contribute\r\nsimilarly so that additional peace-keeping forces may be\r\nspeedily deployed in Liberia to ensure full implementation\r\nof the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) peace agreement.\r\nWith respect to South Africa, there are now clear\r\nindications that the peace process is on track and that change\r\nis irreversible. My delegation welcomes the agreement\r\nreached in the multi-party negotiating forum to set up a\r\nTransitional Executive Council, following agreement on the\r\ndate of the first non-racial, democratic elections.\r\nIn this connection, we fully support the recent appeal of\r\nthe President of the African National Congress (ANC),\r\nMr. Nelson Mandela, that sanctions be lifted. The removal\r\nof sanctions would send to all parties a strong, positive\r\nsignal that the rest of the international community will not\r\nbe found wanting in support and encouragement for the\r\ndifficult transition to a non-racial and democratic society.\r\nHowever, we regret the recurrence of violence, which, if it\r\nis not addressed satisfactorily, may have serious\r\nrepercussions for the transitional arrangements. We\r\ntherefore call on the South African authorities to redouble\r\ntheir efforts to stem the rising tide of political violence.\r\nThe recent breakthrough in the Middle East talks,\r\nevidenced by the deal between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) granting limited autonomy to\r\nthe Palestinians in Gaza and in the city of Jericho, is a most\r\nwelcome development. It constitutes a major step in the\r\nquest for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. We\r\nextend our heartfelt congratulations to those in the leadership\r\nof the two parties for their courage and foresight in making\r\neven this limited success possible in a land often\r\ncharacterized by hate, mistrust and destruction. It is true\r\nthat much remains to be done, but we are optimistic that the\r\nmomentum generated by the Israeli-PLO agreement will be\r\nsustained and expanded to enable all parties to the conflict\r\nto strengthen their resolve in the search for a comprehensive\r\nand durable solution in accordance with Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\r\nWhile the recent developments between Israel and its\r\nArab neighbours provide ground for much optimism, the\r\nsituation between Kuwait and Iraq has failed to register\r\nsimilar progress. I call on the Government of Iraq to\r\ncomply fully with United Nations resolutions and, in\r\nparticular, to ensure the early release of Kuwaiti and other\r\nprisoners.\r\nWe have followed with keen interest the successful\r\nconduct by the United Nations of elections in Cambodia.\r\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General and his staff, as well\r\nas all the countries that helped to bring stability back to\r\nCambodia. We hope that the lessons of this exercise will be\r\nconsolidated and will be applied to other trouble spots that\r\nmay require the assistance of the United Nations.\r\nThe threat to world peace and stability emanates not\r\nonly from armed conflicts but also from socio-economic\r\nfactors. The global economic recession has led to worsening\r\neconomic and social problems. Among the pressing\r\neconomic difficulties that continue to face the developing\r\ncountries is the problem of external debt servicing, which is\r\none of the major obstacles to development. In sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica, the debt stock has increased to $185 billion -\r\nequivalent to 110 per cent of that region’s gross domestic\r\nproduct. As of today, one third of Africa’s total export\r\nearning is paid to the developed countries in the North to\r\nservice its debts. This situation cannot be allowed to\r\ncontinue. More than ever before, there is a need for a\r\nconcerted and innovative international effort to find a\r\npermanent solution to the problem. It is our view that the\r\ninternational community - particularly the industrialized\r\ncountries - has not given this problem the level of attention\r\nit deserves.\r\nWhile Africa’s indebtedness has continued unabated, its\r\nproduction output, in both agriculture and industry, has\r\ncontinued to decline. The combined negative effect is\r\naggravated by serious inflation, which has contributed to a\r\nsteep decline in domestic savings and investment.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe international community’s commitment to\r\nsustainable development in Africa can best be enhanced by\r\nencouraging increased direct foreign investment, as well as\r\nan increased international transfer of financial resources to\r\nthe region. This is crucial to any long-term improvement in\r\nAfrica’s economic situation.\r\nI should add that the removal of unfair trade practices\r\nwould go a long way towards eliminating the need for aid.\r\nThis is why we are anxious to see an early conclusion of the\r\nUruguay Round, which we hope will address the thorny\r\nissue of market access, as this is of major concern to\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nFinally on this issue we call on the United Nations to\r\nprovide the necessary support for the successful implementa-\r\ntion of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s and the work of the United Nations\r\nInter-Agency Task Force on African Economic Recovery\r\nand Development.\r\nWe welcome the initiative of the Japanese Government\r\nin convening the Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment and hope it will contribute to the mobilization\r\nof financial and technological resources much needed to\r\nensure Africa’s development.\r\nIn translating the spirit of Rio de Janeiro into action,\r\nthe Gambia has already launched its Environmental Action\r\nPlan in order to address the serious environmental problems\r\nfacing the country. Coming from a Sahelian country we\r\nremain particularly concerned about the continuous threat\r\nposed by drought and human actions to our fragile\r\necosystem. We welcome the setting up of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee and the\r\ncommencement of the negotiation process for the drawing up\r\nof an international convention to combat drought and\r\ndesertification particularly in Africa. The Gambia will\r\ncontinue to give full support to this Committee.\r\nThe success of our efforts to implement Agenda 21 and\r\nother programmes approved in Rio and adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly will depend to a very large extent on the\r\navailability of funds and the commitment of our partners to\r\nshare resources and encourage technology transfer to forge\r\na truly global partnership between developed and developing\r\ncountries in sustainable development.\r\nIn this connection we share the view that the Global\r\nEnvironment Facility (GEF) should be restructured to allow\r\nfor the increased participation of developing countries in all\r\nits activities as well as for inclusion of desertification as one\r\nof the areas eligible for GEF funding. It is hoped that in\r\nphase II of the GEF there will be an expanded financial base\r\nto allow for greater and more rational disbursements.\r\nIt has now become established practice to convene\r\nsummit meetings on issues of major concern to humanity.\r\nThese summits provide an opportunity to arrive at a\r\ncollective decision at the highest level on ways and means\r\nof resolving these difficulties. It is in this light that we\r\nwelcome the World Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit for Social Development\r\nto be convened in 1995.\r\nAs we move closer to the end of this century, so is the\r\nUnited Nations moving closer to its fiftieth anniversary,\r\nsignalling the maturity of our thoughts and the wisdom of\r\nour actions in seeking global peace and security. As the\r\nprimary role of the United Nations is the maintenance of\r\nworld peace and security, it becomes imperative in this\r\npost-cold-war era to prepare the world body to carry out its\r\nmandate as stipulated in its Charter, taking into account the\r\nprevailing international political climate.\r\nIn this connection my delegation notes with keen\r\ninterest the restructuring and revitalization of the United\r\nNations. We welcome efforts to streamline and rationalize\r\nthe work of the General Assembly at the level of both the\r\nplenary Assembly and the Main Committees. These efforts,\r\nit is hoped, will strengthen the decision-making role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and enhance its effectiveness and\r\nefficiency as the largest and most important organ of the\r\nUnited Nations system. Furthermore, the relationship\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security Council\r\nshould be redefined and better coordinated.\r\nAs regards the reorganization of the Security Council,\r\nefforts should be made to ensure transparency in its work\r\nand activities. The Gambia would support any proposals for\r\nthe reorganization of the Security Council on the basis of\r\nequitable geographical representation.\r\nI wish to conclude by again expressing our faith in the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations, strengthened in its authority\r\nand credibility, to face the many challenges that lie ahead.\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 19\r\nMr. GURIRAB (Namibia): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Namibia, I wish to extend our\r\ndeepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences to the\r\nGovernment and friendly people of India on the heavy loss\r\nof life and destruction of property that resulted from the\r\ndevastating earthquake. I trust that the international\r\ncommunity will give them a full helping hand.\r\nNamibia welcomes all the newest Members of the\r\nOrganization and assures them of its readiness to interact\r\nwith them in the spirit of friendship and solidarity.\r\nThe President of the Assembly hails from a friendly\r\ncountry, Guyana, which did so much to spearhead the\r\nstruggle of the Namibian people for self-determination,\r\nliberation and democracy. The Government and people of\r\nGuyana spared no effort in manifesting, in word and deed,\r\ntheir unswerving support for and solidarity with the\r\nNamibian cause in different world forums. I know all this\r\nbecause I have spent many years at the United Nations and\r\nduring this time I visited Georgetown, his nation’s capital,\r\nand other parts of Guyana on more than one occasion. The\r\nhospitality and camaraderie of his brotherly people always\r\ntouched me very deeply. In his past and present incarnations\r\nin the service of his great country, he and I have\r\ncollaborated on various issues of common interest. It is\r\nagainst this background of mutual friendship and solidarity,\r\ntherefore, that I congratulate him most warmly on his\r\nbrilliant election as President of this challenging session of\r\nthe Assembly. His sterling stewardship is already so\r\neffectively manifest that the successful conclusion of our\r\ndeliberations is assured.\r\nI also wish to place on record our sincere appreciation\r\nto his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\r\nBulgaria, for the effective leadership he provided last\r\nsession.\r\nOur illustrious Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, has since his appointment been spearheading\r\nan effective and innovative global campaign aimed at\r\nstreamlining and strengthening the role of the United Nations\r\nin peace-keeping operations and in economic and\r\nhumanitarian issues. His \"Agenda for Peace\" has provided\r\na useful framework for discussing these and other pressing\r\nissues relating to the maintenance of world peace and\r\nsecurity. Namibia commends the Secretary-General for his\r\ntireless efforts.\r\nOn the threshold of a new millennium, and as we are\r\nabout to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, it is an appropriate time to reflect and take stock.\r\nThis is a period of great hope and confidence in the efficacy\r\nof the United Nations. New vision and foresight are thus\r\ncalled for; bold and imaginative decisions are required.\r\nAt its forty-seventh session the General Assembly, in\r\nresolution 47/62, on the \"Question of equitable representation\r\non and increase in the membership of the Security Council\",\r\nrecognized that in the changing global situation there was a\r\nneed to reorganize, revitalize and democratize the Security\r\nCouncil. The end of the cold war has created new\r\nexpectations that the Security Council will take on larger\r\nresponsibilities and a greater role in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. But if the Security Council\r\nis to be a credible organ of the United Nations, it must fulfil\r\nthese expectations of a changing and demanding world. It\r\nis with this in mind that the \"Question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council\" should be addressed. Changes towards a\r\nmore representative Council would, no doubt, enhance its\r\ncredibility, legitimacy and authority.\r\nNamibia supports the view that the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council should be increased and more permanent\r\nand non-permanent members added, taking into consideration\r\nequitable geographical representation. Africa itself needs an\r\neffective presence on the Council, as do Asia and Latin\r\nAmerica. The outmoded and undemocratic veto power\r\nshould be abolished altogether.\r\nLikewise, there is a compelling need for the\r\nrestructuring of other organs, such as the General Assembly\r\nitself and the Economic and Social Council. The member\r\nStates of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, working\r\nin close partnership with the Group of 77, should involve\r\nthemselves fully in the ongoing discussions on the\r\nrestructuring of these vital organs of the United Nations.\r\nToday we are witnessing a new phenomenon in\r\ninternational relations, characterized by a sense of consensus\r\nderiving from shared interests, in which the credibility and\r\ncentrality of the United Nations in dealing with global\r\nconflicts has been greatly enhanced. Indeed, we have\r\nwitnessed the Organization fulfilling its mandate in the area\r\nof the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe in Namibia believe that now is the opportune\r\nmoment to establish a new role and purpose for a conflict-\r\nresolution mechanism which is appropriate to the post-cold-\r\nwar era and to the needs and aspirations of succeeding\r\ngenerations. The renewed commitment towards conflict\r\nresolution must be transformed into a realistic programme of\r\naction, relating to preventive diplomacy, peacemaking,\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\npeace-keeping and peace-building. Humanity is yearning for\r\na peaceful, just and prosperous world. On this score,\r\nNamibia envisages a meaningful partnership and enhanced\r\ncooperation between the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations and the Secretary-General of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity in the field of conflict resolution and\r\nhumanitarian relief operations in Africa.\r\nNow more than ever, much is expected of the United\r\nNations in the area of conflict resolution. The Organization\r\nhas a golden opportunity to ensure that those expectations\r\nwhich \"We the peoples\" set forth in the Charter, are met by\r\nfurther enhancing its effectiveness.\r\nIt is an accepted fact that peace and stability are\r\nnecessary, albeit not sufficient, conditions for economic\r\ndevelopment. Therefore, peace-keeping, peacemaking and\r\npeace-building should go hand in hand with economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFor peace-keeping operations to be effective, Member\r\nStates should pay promptly their assessed contributions to\r\nthe regular budget and to peace-keeping operations. In this\r\ncontext, we support the establishment of the reserve fund\r\naimed at improving the start-up financing of peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nIn Cambodia, the United Nations Transitional Authority\r\nin Cambodia (UNTAC) accomplished its task satisfactorily.\r\nNamibia was happy to have contributed polling officers and\r\na staffed contingent of reinforced vehicles, called wolves, to\r\nUNTAC. We did this because it was, after all, in Namibia\r\nthat a United Nations peace-keeping operation scored its first\r\nlarge-scale victory. Namibia will favourably consider\r\nparticipation in future United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nUnfortunately, other peace-keeping operations have not\r\nas yet achieved the same positive results. It is our hope that\r\nthe United Nations will continue to help resolve the conflicts\r\nin Somalia, Angola, Rwanda, Liberia, Mozambique, Haiti\r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina, among others.\r\nWith regard to Angola, Mr. Savimbi’s rejection of last\r\nyear’s election results was a major set-back. It has plunged\r\nthat sister country further into a most horrible human\r\ntragedy. The horrendous carnage there continues to claim\r\nabout 1,000 innocent lives a day. It is further reported that\r\nfrom 2 million to 3 million innocent Angolans are at risk of\r\ndying of either direct or indirect effects of this senseless\r\nwar.\r\nThe international community must exert concerted\r\npressure on Mr. Savimbi to accept the will of the Angolan\r\npeople without any further delay. What is now expected of\r\nMr. Savimbi is the speedy implementation of the Bicesse\r\nAccords, the relevant Security Council resolutions, the\r\nAbidjan Protocol and last year’s election results, which,\r\ntaken together, provide the framework for resuming\r\nnegotiations with the Angolan Government.\r\nIt is the view of the Namibian Government that the\r\nresumption of negotiations should lead to an early cease-fire,\r\nwhich will allow the delivery of humanitarian assistance to\r\nthe suffering Angolan people, reconciliation and\r\nconsolidation of the Government of National Unity.\r\nTo this end, and in the face of Mr. Savimbi’s persistent\r\nintransigence, the Security Council had no other alternative\r\nbut to impose sanctions against UNITA. Namibia, therefore,\r\nsupports Security Council resolution 864 (1993) which, inter\r\nalia, calls for the prohibition of all sale or supply to UNITA\r\nof arms and related materiél and military assistance, as well\r\nas petroleum and petroleum products, and urges all Member\r\nStates to implement these measures. We believe also that if\r\nUNITA continues to flout Security Council resolutions,\r\nadditional forms of punitive sanctions should be imposed.\r\nConcerning the situation in Somalia, Namibia supports\r\nthe United Nations peace-keeping operation there. My\r\ndelegation holds the view that disarming the various factions\r\nwould allow the people of Somalia to build genuine bridges\r\nof reconciliation and bring about the restoration of a civil\r\nsociety.\r\nUnder the present circumstances, and in spite of\r\nprovocations by General Aidid’s faction, the United Nations\r\nOperation in Somalia should continue to carry out its\r\nmandate. Our hearts go out in sympathy to all those\r\ncountries whose nationals, including innocent Somalis, have\r\nmade the supreme sacrifice in the service of the United\r\nNations and human brotherhood. Any precipitous\r\nwithdrawal, however, would be to the detriment of innocent\r\nSomali people and is likely to reverse the whole process.\r\nThis should not be allowed to happen.\r\nIn Mozambique, we are encouraged to note that the\r\ncease-fire continues to hold and that the process appears to\r\nbe moving forward. I can hardly overemphasize that it is\r\nabsolutely imperative for elections to be conducted in an\r\natmosphere of peace, trust and cooperation - and this means\r\nthat the armed forces must first be confined to base and\r\ndemobilized, in accordance with the General Peace\r\nAgreement agreed to last year by the two parties.\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 21\r\nNamibia welcomes with satisfaction the recent\r\nencouraging developments that have taken place in South\r\nAfrica. For the first time in the history of that neighbouring\r\ncountry, all the people of South Africa will finally\r\nparticipate in a free and democratic election on 27 April next\r\nyear. We would like, nevertheless, to urge all the people of\r\nSouth Africa to ensure that this process remains on course,\r\nand we call upon all the parties to participate in the work of\r\nthe Transitional Executive Council. In the same vein, we\r\ncall upon them, with the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity, to put an immediate end to the ever-escalating\r\nviolence. Violence and the ballot box do not go together.\r\nNamibia, along with the other members of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee on Southern Africa of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, supports the call made by the President of the\r\nAfrican National Congress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, to lift all\r\nremaining economic sanctions against South Africa.\r\nNamibia further supports the lifting of the oil embargo after\r\nthe establishment and commencement of the work of the\r\nTransitional Executive Council, as well as the establishment\r\nor restoration of full diplomatic relations with South Africa,\r\nfollowing the installation of an elected Interim Government\r\nof National Unity, pursuant to democratic elections next\r\nyear.\r\nThe Middle East, the cradle of some of the world’s\r\nmajor religions, has witnessed bloody conflicts for the\r\ngreater part of this century and has been on the agenda of\r\nthe United Nations since its inception. Namibia welcomes\r\nthe historic breakthrough represented by mutual recognition\r\nand the declaration of principles signed between Israel and\r\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on Palestinian\r\nself-rule in Gaza and the city of Jericho. Despite their long\r\nenmity, the leaders of the State of Israel and the PLO\r\nsummoned the political courage to embrace peace. We can\r\nonly hope that the historic handshake between Mr. Rabin,\r\nPrime Minister of Israel, and Mr. Arafat, Chairman of the\r\nPLO, will usher in a new era in that region.\r\nGranted, this is only a first step, but it constitutes a\r\nfirm basis for building a comprehensive, just and lasting\r\npeace in the Middle East. However, for this undertaking to\r\nsucceed, the infusion of large-scale and sustained\r\ninternational financial and humanitarian assistance is\r\nrequired.\r\nEncouraged by the historic and momentous\r\nbreakthrough in the Middle East and the positive\r\ndevelopments in South Africa, and also taking into\r\nconsideration the emerging climate in favour of\r\nrapprochement in inter-State relations, we believe that the\r\ntime has now come for the leaders of the United States of\r\nAmerica and the Republic of Cuba to travel the short\r\ndistance of 90 miles to reconciliation and peaceful\r\ncoexistence. We are convinced that this can be done in the\r\ninterest of the children of the two countries, who, like those\r\nof South Africa, Israel and Palestine, hope for a peaceful and\r\nbrighter future.\r\nPeace and stability in the Middle East are critically\r\nimportant not only to that region but also to the world as a\r\nwhole. In this context, Namibia associates itself with\r\nSecurity Council resolution 833 (1993) of 27 May 1993,\r\ndealing with the territorial integrity of Kuwait and\r\ninviolability of its borders. We reiterate our full support for\r\nthe right of the people of Kuwait and its Government to\r\ndefend their sovereignty and independence. Namibia is a\r\nsmall State, and we understand the predicament of small\r\nStates.\r\nDuring the last session, I updated this august Assembly\r\non the progress made in our bilateral negotiations with the\r\nGovernment of South Africa on the issue of the transfer and\r\nreintegration of Walvis Bay and the Offshore Islands into\r\nNamibia. Today, I am happy to report that the matter has\r\nfinally been resolved. On 28 February 1994, the transfer\r\nand reintegration of Walvis Bay and the Offshore Islands\r\ninto Namibia will take place. This will, at last, mark the\r\ncompletion of the decolonization of Namibia and the\r\nunification of our nation. I take this opportunity to express\r\nour deep appreciation to the Member States for their\r\nconsistent support, over the years, of Security Council\r\nresolution 432 (1978) on Walvis Bay. I would also like to\r\nthank, in particular, the South African Multi-Party\r\nNegotiating Forum for adopting an important resolution\r\nwhich speeded up this process.\r\nThe Rio Earth Summit marked an historic turning-point\r\nin the long struggle to increase international awareness about\r\nthe true nature of the global environmental crisis. The\r\nSummit effectively moved a long way towards a better\r\nunderstanding of how future economic development is\r\ninextricably linked to sound policies aimed at promoting and\r\nprotecting the environment.\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nTo this end, and in line with the provisions of our\r\nConstitution, Namibia has launched a countrywide\r\nprogramme of tree planting to prevent further deforestation\r\nand degradation of the environment. Naturally, Namibia,\r\nlike the other developing countries, is anxious to see\r\ngenerous financing and implementing of Agenda 21.\r\nLet me now turn to the socio-economic problems we\r\nare facing today. Despite the promise world leaders made\r\nto children at the World Summit for Children here in New\r\nYork in 1990, education, health, water, shelter and food\r\nsecurity remain inaccessible to millions of children in the\r\ndeveloping world - and Namibia is no exception.\r\nIn Africa, problems of hunger, malnutrition, disease,\r\nand so on, continue to thwart the commitment we made last\r\nyear at Dakar during the International Conference on\r\nAssistance for the African Child, to place children first. In\r\nfurtherance of this commitment, and convinced that the\r\nproblems of the Namibian children can be addressed only in\r\na comprehensive manner, we have already integrated the\r\nNational Programme of Action on children into the overall\r\nNational Development Plan. This National Development\r\nPlan constitutes the basis for social and economic\r\ndevelopment in Namibia. In this context, primary health\r\ncare, education, provision of water and rural development\r\nare among the priorities of our National Development Plan.\r\nThe 20/20 Vision programme we adopted at Dakar\r\nmust be implemented if we are to achieve tangible results by\r\nthe year 1995, when we shall review progress made since\r\nthe 1990 World Summit, including in particular the fate and\r\nwelfare of those children engulfed in war situations.\r\nThe recent World Conference on Human Rights in\r\nVienna has further exposed the unmitigated violence and\r\nother forms of injustice being perpetrated against women\r\nthroughout the world. The Namibian Constitution contains\r\nspecific provisions on protection of the rights of women and\r\npromotion of their welfare. Furthermore, Namibia is a party\r\nto the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women.\r\nIt is against this background that we in Namibia have\r\ntaken measures to raise women’s awareness of their rights\r\nby translating this Convention into indigenous languages. In\r\nthe same vein, we applaud the appointment of the Special\r\nRapporteur to study the issue of violence against women. It\r\nis with this in mind that Namibia looks forward to the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women, in anticipation that its\r\ndecisions will further advance the cause of women in the\r\nworld, especially in Africa.\r\nThese are some of the many concerns on the social\r\nagenda of all nations. Thus to us, the appointment of a\r\nUnited Nations commissioner for human rights makes much\r\nsense, and we support the idea. At the same time, we would\r\nlike to urge everyone to ensure that the mandate and status\r\nof such a high-level international civil servant should be\r\nconsidered carefully and realistically.\r\nIn order to meet the acute shortages of housing, the\r\nGovernment has embarked upon a programme to provide\r\nadequate housing to the Namibian people by the year 2000.\r\nIn recognition of this national effort, Namibia was awarded\r\nthe Habitat Scroll of Honour for 1993 for our National\r\nHousing Programme, called \"Build Together\". This award\r\nwas received by my distinguished colleague, the Honourable\r\nMrs. Libertine Amathila, Minister of Local and Regional\r\nGovernment and Housing, two days ago. I would like to\r\necho the words of my colleague by thanking Habitat for this\r\noutstanding honour.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate my Government’s\r\nbelief that the United Nations, as a unique international\r\nbody, can live up to its lofty ideals of creating a peaceful,\r\nsecure and just world for us and for generations to come.\r\nTo this end, Namibia pledges its total commitment.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate for this\r\nmeeting. A number of representatives have asked to speak\r\nin exercise of their right of reply, and I shall call on them\r\nnow.\r\nI remind members that statements made in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second intervention,\r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. GUILLEN (Peru) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nYesterday, 5 October, the Foreign Minister of our sister\r\nRepublic of Ecuador, Mr. Diego Paredes Peña, made a\r\nstatement in which he rightly made extended reference to the\r\ncordial relations between our two countries and to recent\r\ninitiatives by the Governments of Peru and of Ecuador in\r\ntheir shared desire to broaden the ties binding the two\r\ncountries for the good of the development of our two\r\npeoples and to bring them closer together.\r\nMy Government fully agrees with the comments made\r\nby Foreign Minister Paredes, for we too are motivated by a\r\ndesire for an improved climate of respect, cooperation and\r\nfriendship between our two countries. Such a climate should\r\nenable us to deal in a unified way with the rich array of\r\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 23\r\nissues and tasks that go to make up the relationship between\r\ntwo peoples bound by history, geography and culture.\r\nMy Government wishes also to stress its devotion to\r\npeace and to respect for the international legal order, as\r\nreflected in its faithful and unflagging adherence to the\r\nprinciples and purposes enshrined in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. For that reason, the Government of Peru\r\ncannot but agree completely that any difference or\r\ncontroversy should be resolved by peaceful means as\r\nrecognized and prescribed in international law.\r\nIn that connection, the President of the Republic of\r\nPeru, Mr. Alberto Fujimori, made a comprehensive proposal\r\nin November 1991 for friendship, cooperation and\r\nintegration. By developing and implementing these purposes\r\nand principles and by conforming to the spirit of fraternal\r\nties inspired by the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol, that\r\nproposal aimed at establishing an interesting and beneficial\r\nworking agenda for Peru and Ecuador with the aim of\r\nidentifying once and for all the demarcation of the\r\noutstanding portions of our common border, of signing a\r\ntreaty on trade and navigation on the Amazon and its\r\nsouthern tributaries, of achieving a broad agreement on\r\nborder integration, and of arriving at agreements that would\r\nfoster mutual trust and security.\r\nIn that context of cordial and beneficial relations, Peru\r\nhas proposed deepened bilateral dialogue and direct talks\r\nbetween the two Governments. It is also prepared to\r\nestablish machinery for coordination and consultation, which\r\nhitherto have been lacking. We are convinced that this\r\ndiplomatic exercise will provide room for developments that\r\nshould greatly promote closer communication between our\r\ntwo Governments. The bilateral instruments that link us\r\nprovide for a system for the settlement of disputes, which\r\nseveral times has proven valid and effective in properly\r\novercoming difficulties that have caused it to be invoked.\r\nIn accordance with the instruments, machinery and\r\nsystems to which I have referred, Peru proposed to Ecuador\r\nthe viable and appropriate procedure of jointly asking the\r\ncountries guarantors of the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol to\r\nhave the Holy See appoint an expert to complete the\r\ndemarcation of the outstanding segments of our common\r\nborder.\r\nIn that same constructive spirit, which should prevail\r\nbetween two sister countries, Peru has always maintained\r\nthat cooperation and integration between Peru and Ecuador\r\nshould prevail in all the geographical areas the two countries\r\nshare, from the Pacific and the Andes to the vast Amazon\r\nregion - areas that give the relationship between Peru and\r\nEcuador its special personality and characteristics. The new\r\nchallenge of the twenty-first century is without doubt to\r\ndevise a programme of sustainable development for the\r\nAmazon region. It is in implementing that programme that\r\nthe two nations must find the raison d’être for their new\r\nties. This would restore the historic association that existed\r\nbetween our two nations from pre-Columbian times to the\r\nbirth of our Republics.\r\nHence, the Government of Peru was particularly pleased\r\nby the statement by the Foreign Minister of Ecuador that his\r\ncountry was renewing and reaffirming its determination to\r\nrenounce the use or threat of use of force in relations with\r\nmy country. We were pleased also because that statement\r\nis in complete accord with Peru’s determination in this\r\nregard, in recognition of the bilateral and multilateral\r\ncommitments binding the two countries, to consolidate a\r\nclimate of détente and mutual trust and to develop a level of\r\nsecurity that responds to our common desire to strengthen\r\nfriendship and cooperation between our two nations.\r\nThe President of the Republic of Peru,\r\nMr. Alberto Fujimori, took great pleasure in extending a\r\nwarm invitation to the President of Ecuador, His Excellency\r\nMr. Sixto Durán Ballén, to visit our country whenever the\r\ninterests of consolidating friendship between Peru and\r\nEcuador would best be served. It was with equal pleasure\r\nthat we learned of President Fujimori’s acceptance of the\r\ninvitation to visit Peru, whose people and Government will\r\nreciprocate the appreciation and support that the noble\r\npeople of Ecuador demonstrated to the President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru during his official visit to Quito in January\r\n1992.\r\nMr. EXARCHOS (Greece): A few days ago, the\r\nrepresentative of Albania, exercising his right of reply in\r\nresponse to the statement of the Foreign Minister of Greece\r\nbefore the General Assembly, tried to dismiss our legitimate\r\nconcern regarding the unsatisfactory situation of the large\r\nGreek minority in Albania, attributing our understandable\r\nconcern to \"extreme nationalism for electoral purposes\".\r\n(A/48/PV.13, p. 173)\r\nBut the unacceptable treatment of the Greek minority\r\nhas been highlighted in many reports of international bodies,\r\nvery recently by the European Parliament, which, in a\r\nresolution adopted on 14 July 1993, called upon the\r\nAlbanian Government to respect the cultural and religious\r\nrights of the Greek minority in Albania.\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIt is indeed regrettable that certain practices inspired\r\nand implemented by the previous communist regime\r\ncontinue to be applied by the present government, such as,\r\nfor instance, the arbitrarily designated minority zones.\r\nFor its part, Greece, which scrupulously applies the\r\nnorms and provisions of the basic documents of the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)\r\non minorities, expects Albania to act in the same respectful\r\nmanner, specifically with regard to educational and religious\r\nfreedom.\r\nFurthermore, the Permanent Mission of Albania\r\ncirculated a press release, dated 4 October 1993,\r\nmisrepresenting the content of a letter addressed by the\r\nCSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities,\r\nMr. van der Stoel, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nAlbania. Indeed, an inappropriate effort was made to\r\npresent the views of the Albanian authorities regarding the\r\ntreatment of the Greek minority as the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations of the High Commissioner himself.\r\nGreece, which from the beginning of the new era\r\nsupported Albania in its first steps towards democratization\r\nand reconstruction, accepts the expression of Albania’s\r\ngratitude in this respect and intends to be a friendly and\r\nsupportive neighbour in the future.\r\nAt this point, I should like to mention that my country’s\r\nhumanitarian and economic assistance was not limited to the\r\nsouthern part of Albania only, but covered the central and\r\nnorthern part of it as well. May I add that the attitude and\r\nbehaviour of the Albanian authorities towards\r\nthe Greek minority will be a determining factor in our\r\nrelations.\r\nThe Greek delegation took note of the commitment\r\nmade before the Assembly by the Albanian Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs that his Government\r\n\"is determined to build a modern State and a civilized\r\nsociety, based on respect for the human rights of all\r\nstrata of the population without exception or\r\ndiscrimination ... so that persons belonging to national\r\nminorities can assert their own national identity\".\r\n(A/48/PV.5, p. 154)\r\nWe are looking forward to seeing those words followed by\r\ndeeds.\r\nMr. KIM Jae Hon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea wishes to express its regret at the fact that the\r\nForeign Minister of Singapore, in his statement this morning,\r\nused impolite and immoral terms when referring to my\r\ncountry, terms improper to his official position.\r\nMy delegation strongly believes that such behaviour\r\nshould not reoccur in this Hall.\r\nMr. HOXHA (Albania): The delegation of Albania will\r\navail itself of the opportunity to respond to the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Greece at a later stage in the\r\ngeneral debate.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.\r\n"
