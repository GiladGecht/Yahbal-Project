"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n20th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nThursday, 7 October 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. ALIJA IZETBEGOVIC,\r\nPRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND\r\nHERZEGOVINA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will hear an address\r\nby the President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nMr. Alija Izetbegovic, President of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, His Excellency Mr. Alija Izetbegovic, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident IZETBEGOVIC: Let me begin by\r\nextending, on behalf of the people and Government of the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, our most heartfelt\r\ncondolences to the peoples and Governments of both\r\nVenezuela and India, which have recently been hit severely\r\nby the tragedy of disaster. It is our hope that both countries,\r\nthrough the will and spirit of their peoples, will recover\r\nquickly.\r\nMay we also extend our sympathies to those countries\r\nand families that have lost loved ones under the United\r\nNations flag in Bosnia and Herzegovina in attempting to\r\ncarry out their mission of peace and humanity. Indeed, our\r\nsympathies go out to all families of United Nations\r\npersonnel in all peace-keeping missions throughout the globe\r\nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nWe should also like to congratulate the Palestinian and\r\nIsraeli people on their recent efforts towards peace. We are\r\nlikewise happy to see the great strides towards democracy\r\nbeing made in South Africa.\r\nMr. President, it is my pleasure and privilege to extend\r\nto you our sincerest congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession. Your election to this high office reaffirms the\r\nimportance of the role that small States play in the family of\r\nnations.\r\nWe should also like to extend our appreciation to your\r\ndistinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stojan Ganev,\r\nour Balkan colleague, for conducting the deliberations of this\r\nbody with great expertise and commitment.\r\nThe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is pleased to\r\nwelcome the Organization’s newest Members: Andorra, the\r\nCzech Republic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia and the Slovak Republic. We are confident that\r\nthese Members will uphold the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nThe international community has neither a definite\r\npolicy nor a clear plan of political action that would\r\nfacilitate a transition from the Communist structures that\r\nhave been in power for 50 years to concepts based on\r\nfreedom and democracy. We believe that it is impossible to\r\nfind solutions for either global or local conflicts unless a\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86788 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.20\r\n26 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nclear stand is taken on the overall question of what the\r\npost-Communist heritage is to be.\r\nThe negative aspects of this problem have been fully\r\nillustrated in the case of my country. It is obvious that the\r\nremaining forces of the Communist potential for aggression\r\nhave been exercised against us and that an extirpation of\r\nchances for democratic development has been perpetrated\r\nbefore the eyes of Europe, America and the whole world.\r\nThis act is being carried out entirely by force, in forms\r\nranging from aggression and mass murder of civilians to\r\ndestruction of all traces of civilization and culture and the\r\nextermination of whole nations by the barbaric tactics of\r\nburned and destroyed land.\r\nSimultaneously with this unprecedented violence, an\r\nexperiment in political vivisection is being carried out\r\nagainst our country. It is being carried out by an\r\ninternational community that, in the case of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, has obviously been testing various models for\r\nthe post-Communist State. The experiment, unfortunately,\r\nis being performed in vivo by testing various hypotheses on\r\nour living national and governmental organism. In this\r\nexperiment, our people are dying, and so is our country and\r\nour State.\r\nThe first experiment was performed by the London\r\nConference. This concept, which sought to stop the\r\naggression, was abandoned without a single attempt to\r\nimplement it; and this only intensified the war on our soil.\r\nThis was followed by an attempt to find a solution by means\r\nof constitutional, legal and political reform to a crisis that\r\nwas becoming ever deeper. This project, known as the\r\nVance-Owen plan, no one even attempted to implement. It\r\nwas abandoned only to be replaced by a new one, which is\r\nbased on the false thesis that what we have in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is a civil war between the three peoples and\r\nthat territorial partition is therefore the only solution.\r\nBut this plan is being fulfilled neither with respect to\r\nthe idea that the partition of the land should be carried out\r\nin accordance with the criterion of ethnic majority, nor with\r\nrespect to the basic intention of bringing about peace. As a\r\nresult, the uncontrollable unfolding of events will continue,\r\nand will cause nothing but new suffering for our people.\r\nNow the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are being\r\nasked to choose between a just, defensive war and an unjust\r\npeace. The war, if continued, is likely to cause further\r\nsuffering for our people and the further destruction of our\r\nnation. It could mean the death of thousands more.\r\nThe unjust peace plan is flawed because it is based\r\nupon the repugnant and historically failed concept of ethnic\r\npartition and apartheid. The flaw is compounded by the fact\r\nthat even the partition is unfair, since it seeks to satisfy the\r\naggressor’s appetite for an inequitably large share at the\r\nexpense of the victim.\r\nHowever, the flaws in the so-called peace plan being\r\nforced upon us are not merely philosophical. First, any plan\r\nthat legitimizes genocide and promotes ethnic partition will\r\nmost likely sow the seeds for new aggression and fuel the\r\nfires of retribution. Secondly, any peace that does not\r\naddress the true causes of war will, at best, offer only\r\ntemporary, remedial relief rather than promoting the healing\r\nthat is essential. Finally, any peace plan that makes no\r\nprovision for a viable Bosnian State, that does not address\r\neven the most basic needs of the victim and that does not\r\nprovide the necessary measures for real implementation and\r\ndurability is, in the end, not a plan for real peace.\r\nLast week’s provisional acceptance by the Bosnian\r\nParliament of the peace proposals is dependent on the same\r\nminimal adjustments that we have consistently held to be\r\nnecessary for a durable peace. These adjustments are the\r\nfollowing:\r\nFirst, the Bosnian Republic within the proposed Union\r\nof the Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be viable\r\ngeographically, economically, politically and defensively.\r\nSecondly, the aggressor forces must surrender control\r\nof the territories where they have slaughtered and expelled\r\ncivilian populations so that the Bosnians can return to their\r\nhomes. Well over half a million refugees would find it\r\nimpossible to return to villages, towns and cities from which\r\nthey were expelled if Serbian forces that committed murder,\r\nrape and torture were to continue to control those territories.\r\nThere is the option that some of those territories could be\r\ntemporarily administered by international peace-keeping\r\nforces.\r\nThirdly, the final agreement must contain\r\ncomprehensive and specific guarantees concerning its\r\nimplementation from those nations and regional\r\norganizations that will actually be enforcing the peace. Such\r\nguarantees must be an integral part of the peace accords and\r\ncannot be delayed until a later date. Otherwise, we risk\r\nadopting another agreement or commitment that will, like so\r\nmany others previously, become worthless for peace and of\r\nvalue only to further legitimize the aggressor.\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 3\r\nFourthly, in the event that the international community\r\nis not successful in implementing the peace plan, then we\r\nmust be allowed to arm and defend ourselves.\r\nConsistent with its authority and unavoidable\r\nresponsibility, the Security Council should evaluate the plan\r\nprepared by Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg to determine its\r\nconsistency or inconsistency with the United Nations Charter\r\nand numerous resolutions previously adopted by the Council.\r\nThe Council cannot escape its responsibilities and the\r\ninherent inconsistencies by hiding behind the frequently\r\nrepeated excuse that it will accept whatever all the parties\r\nagree to, when one party, the victim, is under the pressure\r\nof the very real threat of genocide.\r\nAs further negotiations on these matters continue, the\r\nmediation team should be enlarged to include a\r\nrepresentative of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO), which will most likely be the agent of\r\nenforcement. This would add a degree of clarity, direction\r\nand credibility to the talks that has been lacking so far.\r\nNow, let me bring to the Assembly’s attention the\r\nimpending humanitarian tragedy unfolding in my country.\r\nOn behalf of all Bosnians, I must first thank the United\r\nNations and all the friendly Governments, private institutions\r\nand heroic individuals that have helped provide humanitarian\r\nassistance in Bosnia. We profoundly appreciate the efforts\r\nthat have so far saved many lives. But with the coming of\r\nwinter, more help will be needed if our wounded and\r\nmalnourished population is to avoid finally succumbing to\r\nstarvation, disease and exposure. In this effort it is essential\r\nthat the international community and its most capable\r\nmembers and relevant regional organizations do the\r\nfollowing: first, take steps to encourage and enforce the\r\nmaintenance of the cease-fires recently agreed to by all the\r\nrelevant forces; secondly, take steps, as envisioned in several\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, to stop the blockage of\r\nhumanitarian relief and other essential supplies such as\r\nwater, electricity and gas; thirdly, reopen Tuzla Airport,\r\nmaking possible the delivery of humanitarian relief to over\r\na million people; and, fourthly, establish clear demands for\r\nthe lifting of the siege of Sarajevo as a first step towards the\r\nlifting of all sieges of Bosnian towns, including the safe\r\nareas designated by Security Council resolutions 824 (1993)\r\nand 836 (1993).\r\nOur Bosnian minority in Serbia, the Muslims of\r\nSandzak, have been deprived of their rights. Many people\r\nwho have defended the rights of their countrymen have been\r\nimprisoned or expelled. While the Serbian regime has\r\nostensibly been protecting the rights of ethnic Serbs in\r\nCroatia, it has not been willing to recognize those same\r\nrights for minorities in Serbia. We demand the same rights\r\nfor the Muslims of Sandzak as those that Serbs are\r\ndemanding for themselves in Croatia. Future negotiations\r\ncannot neglect this very important political and human-rights\r\nissue.\r\nAs United States President Clinton recently stated\r\nbefore this body, the United Nations cannot become involved\r\nin every world conflict. United Nations involvement should\r\nonly be undertaken with a clear political and military\r\nstrategy in place. Tragically, United Nations involvement in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has so far shown the very antithesis\r\nof any clarity of objective and firmness of resolve. The\r\nmoral void created by this confusion has naturally been\r\nfilled with a determination to defer to the aggressor’s wishes\r\nat the expense of the victim. The United Nations\r\nintervention, in its half-heartedness and equivocation,\r\ncombined with its proud insistence that it is getting the job\r\ndone and that therefore we cannot be allowed to arm\r\nourselves, may well go down in history as the principal\r\ninstrument of my country’s destruction.\r\nIn this regard, a few unavoidable questions arise. Why\r\nhas there been no implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 824 (1993) and 836 (1993) calling for the lifting\r\nof the siege of our cities? What has happened to the\r\nSecurity Council’s demands in resolution 752 (1992) for the\r\nwithdrawal of all Serbian military and paramilitary units\r\nfrom our country along with their heavy weapons? Why has\r\nthere been no implementation of Security Council resolutions\r\n787 (1992) and 838 (1993), which were to monitor the\r\nborder between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and\r\nprevent the continuing massive flow of arms and material\r\ngoing to the aggressors in Bosnia?\r\nIt is no longer possible to speak of non-intervention.\r\nThe international community’s involvement in Bosnia began\r\nwith the imposition of the arms embargo and has continued\r\nthrough this whole series of unfulfilled commitments. The\r\nUnited Nations must either follow\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthrough with its intervention or decide to rescind that\r\nintervention. One way or another, it cannot continue with\r\nthe present policy, which makes it an accomplice in the\r\ndestruction of the Bosnian people.\r\nMy Government remains committed to peace and to the\r\nideals of a pluralistic, democratic and multi-religious society.\r\nUnfortunately, some of the very nations that espouse these\r\nideals world wide have betrayed them by inaction, and in\r\ntheir own backyards. We cannot indefinitely continue a\r\nstruggle on principle without adequate help from outside or\r\nwithout at least being afforded the full opportunity to defend\r\nourselves.\r\nThe action of our Parliament is clear in its commitment\r\nto peace, its demands for a viable State and a durable peace.\r\nPrinciples have been shamelessly abandoned by those who\r\nhad the greatest duty and reason to uphold them in our\r\ncountry. We cannot and will not accommodate the anxieties\r\nof those same Governments and allow them to pressure us\r\nto abandon our last hope for self-preservation and a real and\r\ndurable peace.\r\nAlthough there has been a process through which many\r\nwitnesses to this crime have become anaesthetized to its\r\nhorror, the horror itself will never go away, and future\r\ngenerations of the righteous and the just in every nation will\r\nneither forgive nor trust the countries which allowed it to\r\nhappen. At least a billion people are waiting for this body\r\nto act. Are Members really ready to surrender Bosnia and\r\nits people to annihilation? Those billion people I have\r\nmentioned, and not only they, will never forgive you.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alija Izetbegović, President of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I remind delegates once again\r\nthat any congratulations to be expressed to speakers should\r\nbe done through the delegations in the aisles adjoining the plenary.\r\nMr. AL-MUNTASSER (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): On behalf of my delegation,\r\nmay I condole through the delegation of India, with the\r\nGovernment and people of India over the natural calamity\r\nwhich has befallen that great people. Allow me, at the\r\noutset, to congratulate you sincerely on your election to the\r\npresidency of the forty-eighth session of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly. I should also like to express my\r\ncountry’s appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan\r\nGanev, for his constructive efforts. We hope that in\r\ncontinuing to play a constructive role in the new\r\ninternational environment the General Assembly will benefit\r\nfrom your diplomatic skills and broad experience.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to express our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for his dedication to the United Nations and\r\nfor his efforts aimed at reforming the Organization at this\r\ncritical juncture.\r\nI should like also to welcome the new countries that\r\nhave joined the United Nations. We are confident that their\r\nmembership will enhance the role of the Organization and\r\nfurther universal acceptance of its principles and purposes,\r\nwhich aim at establishing and strengthening international\r\npeace and security and ensuring that justice is done.\r\nToday, the people of the Jamahiriya celebrate the\r\nanniversary of the departure of the last remnants of Fascism\r\nfrom Libyan soil, thus putting an end to a period in its\r\nhistory that was characterized by the domination of settler-\r\ncolonialism, a period during which injustice and persecution\r\nprevailed. As our people celebrate this anniversary today,\r\nthey reaffirm that relations between Libya and the State from\r\nwhich those settlers came are now relations of good-\r\nneighbourliness, based on understanding and cooperation in\r\nevery field.\r\nDuring the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly, there were numerous developments in the\r\ninternational situation. However, before I speak of my\r\ncountry’s position on those developments, allow me to start\r\nwith a question which is of great importance to us and\r\nwhich is not unrelated to those recent international\r\ndevelopments. Rather, it is one of their by-products. It has\r\nto do with the tendency of certain countries to impose\r\nsolutions to their differences with other countries in a\r\nmanner that is not consonant with the Charter of the United\r\nNations or with international norms and conventions. In so\r\ndoing, those countries tend to deliberately apply double\r\nstandards, especially when the dispute is with a country that\r\npursues independent policies and adopts unsubmissive\r\npositions. This is the case with regard to the dispute that\r\narose between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and France,\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 5\r\nBritain and the United States of America, when the three\r\ncountries declared that they suspected the involvement of\r\nLibyan nationals in the Pan American and UTA plane\r\nincidents and demanded that two Libyan citizens be handed\r\nover to stand trial in Scotland or the United States of\r\nAmerica. Notwithstanding the fact that the Libyan\r\nauthorities, once notified, took the appropriate legal steps,\r\nthe other parties refused to cooperate with the Libyan\r\nauthorities or to await the results of their ongoing\r\ninvestigations. Instead, they resorted to the Security Council\r\nand directed it to deal with this matter under Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter, which has nothing to do with the issue in\r\nquestion. Libya has not threatened anyone, nor has it\r\nendangered international peace and security. The whole\r\nthing is a question of suspicions and allegations that have to\r\nbe investigated through judicial channels.\r\nAlthough my country realizes that this matter has been\r\naddressed, intentionally, within a framework that is totally\r\nincompatible with its legal character, it has continued to\r\ninvestigate the whole issue, as it has done since it was\r\nnotified of the matter, because it is determined to uncover\r\nthe circumstances and facts surrounding the case. Libya has\r\nalso declared its readiness to cooperate by responding to the\r\nrequirements of Security Council resolution 731 (1992),\r\nwhich include cooperation with the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations to ensure the success of the mission\r\nentrusted to him by that resolution.\r\nIn this respect, my country has reiterated its\r\ncondemnation of international terrorism in every shape and\r\nform. It has severed relations with all organizations and\r\nentities suspected of being involved in terrorist acts and has\r\naffirmed that it will not allow its territory, institutions or\r\ncitizens to be used, directly or indirectly, for the carrying out\r\nof such acts. It has declared its readiness to punish severely\r\nthose proven guilty of involvement in terrorist activities. My\r\ncountry has also declared that there are no terrorist training\r\ncamps on its soil and has invited the Security Council, or\r\nany other international body the Council may choose, to\r\ninvestigate and verify this.\r\nIn addition, my country has cooperated with the\r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom in trying to find\r\nindividuals whom the British Government has accused of\r\ninvolvement in terrorist acts. More than one meeting has\r\nbeen held in this respect, and British officials have\r\nconfirmed the Jamahiriya’s positive cooperation with them\r\nin this matter. Moreover, in order to determine the\r\nresponsibility for the bombing of the French UTA plane,\r\nmore than one meeting has been held between the Libyan\r\ninvestigative judge and his French counterpart. Contacts are\r\nongoing with the French authorities to arrange the French\r\njudge’s visit, and his mission will be facilitated, provided he\r\narrives in a peaceful and civilized manner and not in the\r\nmanner of sixteenth-century gunboat diplomacy.\r\nI have spoken briefly of the measures taken by Libya\r\nin response to the stipulations of Security Council\r\nresolution 731 (1992). As regards the determination of\r\nresponsibility for these terrorist acts to which the American\r\nand French planes were subjected, my country took legal and\r\ninvestigative measures and has called on the British and\r\nAmerican authorities to cooperate in completing the\r\ninvestigation. It has also called on neutral bodies and\r\ninternational and humanitarian organizations to verify the\r\nfairness of the investigations.\r\nConcerning its contribution to the eradication of\r\ninternational terrorism, the aforementioned practical\r\nmeasures prove my country’s seriousness in stamping out\r\nthis phenomenon. Libya’s eagerness to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism was embodied in our call for the\r\nconvening of a special session of the General Assembly to\r\nstudy the causes and dimensions of the problem.\r\nThe matter that has not yet been resolved is that\r\nrelating to the request by the British and American\r\nauthorities to turn over the two suspects to stand trial in the\r\ncourts of one of those countries. My country has spared no\r\neffort in seeking to resolve this problem in accordance with\r\nthe conventions of legality. We offered to go to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and we proposed surrendering\r\nthe two suspects to the United Nations office in Libya for\r\ninvestigation. We also proposed that the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations establish a legal fact-finding\r\ncommittee to examine the verisimilitude of the accusations\r\nand carry out a comprehensive investigation.\r\nThe competent authorities in my country put this\r\nproblem before the Basic People’s Congresses - the\r\nlegislative authority - in Libya, which adopted a decision\r\nwherein they stated they would not object to the suspects\r\nbeing tried before an unbiased and fair court agreed upon by\r\nall concerned. On this basis, my country announced its\r\nreadiness to enter into negotiations with the countries\r\nconcerned, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, on\r\na venue for the trial that could be agreed upon by all parties\r\nto the dispute and that would guarantee an environment\r\nconducive to revealing the truth. To our minds, this is the\r\nsubstance of Security Council resolution 731 (1992). The\r\nSecretary-General was notified of this step in December\r\n1992 and again last July, when he was informed that Libya\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nwas prepared to discuss the proceedings and arrangements\r\nrelating to the trial.\r\nThe position taken by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\r\nconcerning these disputes met with widespread approval\r\nfrom various States and regional organizations, including the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, which is made up of some 110\r\nStates (see the Jakarta Message, A/47/675); the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, with its 54 members\r\n(resolutions 6/20 and 21/14); the League of Arab States,\r\nwhich has 22 members (resolutions 5156, 5158, 5161, 5224\r\nand 5281); and, last but not least, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), which consists of more than 50\r\nStates. The OAU, in resolution 1457, expressed appreciation\r\nfor Libya’s initiatives towards the resolution of this dispute\r\nand commended Libya’s readiness to cooperate with the\r\nlegal and judicial authorities and called upon the Security\r\nCouncil to review resolution 748 (1992) with a view to\r\nlifting the embargo imposed on Libya.\r\nThe positions taken by these organizations show that\r\nthey see the justice of the Libyan viewpoint, and also\r\nhighlight their interest in playing their roles in resolving the\r\ndispute by peaceful means according to Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter. It was hoped that the three States concerned would\r\ntake these positions into consideration and respond to the\r\nLibyan initiatives, but our efforts have been rejected.\r\nMoreover, the States concerned have discredited both the\r\nflexibility and responsiveness of the Libyan position and\r\nhave insisted, in contravention of international laws and\r\npractices, on the extradition of the suspects to the United\r\nStates or Britain to stand trial before the courts of one of\r\nthose countries.\r\nLibya has not, in principle, rejected the trial of the\r\nsuspects, as it has confirmed from the very start. All Libya\r\nhas asked for, and is still determined to obtain, is a\r\nlegitimate and unbiased trial with all the legal and\r\npsychological guarantees that go with it. Intensive\r\nconsultations and contacts in this regard were recently\r\nconducted, and their results were communicated to the\r\nSecretary-General on 24 September 1993. Libya considers\r\nthe content of the Secretary-General’s reply sufficient and\r\nacceptable, and, therefore, the only step left in the resolution\r\nof this problem is that of convincing the suspects to submit\r\nthemselves to the Scottish judiciary. The Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya is encouraging them to do so. This was\r\ncommunicated to the Secretary-General in two letters\r\ncontained in document S/26523, dated 1 October 1993.\r\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has responded\r\npragmatically to the stipulations of Security Council\r\nresolution 731 (1992). Now it becomes necessary not only\r\nto abandon the efforts aimed at tightening the sanctions\r\nimposed by resolution 748 (1992), but to lift those sanctions\r\nimmediately. This is why we appeal to this Assembly,\r\nwhich represents the conscience of the world, to support the\r\nmeasures that have been called for by the international and\r\nregional organizations I have mentioned.\r\nThe sanctions have caused the Libyan people much\r\nmisery and have cost them billions of dollars in material\r\nlosses, to which must be added the deaths of hundreds of\r\nchildren, women and elderly people. I do not want to go\r\ninto detail, for we have elaborated on this in 14 documents,\r\nthe latest of which is document S/26139. However, in brief,\r\nlet me say that the embargo has prevented about 8,525\r\npatients with severe illnesses from travelling abroad for\r\ntreatment. It has prevented college professors from\r\ntravelling to Libya and has led to the suspension of contracts\r\nwith hundreds of physicians. The embargo has caused the\r\nnumber of fatal road accidents to double because of the\r\ndifficulty in transporting the injured to specialized hospitals\r\nin neighbouring countries. Also, the death rate among cattle\r\nhas been high because of lack of immunization and a\r\nshortage of preventive medications. It has cut the revenue\r\nfrom economic activities by more than $2,400,000,000.\r\nFurthermore, there is a severe lack of spare parts for aircraft,\r\nwhich has led to a plane crash with 157 fatalities among\r\npassengers of various nationalities.\r\nThe easing of tensions in international relations has\r\nenabled the international community to achieve progress in\r\nthe areas of disarmament and the protection of human rights.\r\nIt has also enhanced international efforts aimed at solving\r\ndisputes which, until recently, have been a source of great\r\nconcern. This has included the reconciliation in Cambodia\r\nand the maintenance of stability in Central America. There\r\nare also positive signs regarding the attainment of lasting\r\npeace in Mozambique. Important steps have been taken\r\ntowards full national reconciliation in Liberia, and the\r\ndispute in Rwanda is on its way to a final solution.\r\nHowever, these hopeful developments should not mask the\r\nfact that the world now is in the grip of unprecedented\r\ntensions and conflicts, which necessitate further efforts by\r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations not only to\r\nresolve them but also to prevent certain countries from\r\nmonopolizing the resolution of such conflicts. The problem\r\nof Cyprus remains unsolved. The situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the Balkans in general has deteriorated and\r\ncontinues to cause much human misery. Afghanistan has not\r\nachieved total stability yet, and fighting in Angola has\r\nintensified. The national peace accords there have not been\r\ngenuinely observed, regardless of the international and\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 7\r\nregional efforts deployed. The situation in South Africa has\r\nwitnessed some positive developments, but an immediate\r\nstop must be put to the acts of violence which negatively\r\naffect the transformation of South Africa into a unified,\r\ndemocratic and non-racial State.\r\nFor more than four decades, the United Nations has\r\ncontinued to adopt numerous resolutions on the question of\r\nPalestine. Regardless, the Israelis have refused to comply\r\nwith any of those resolutions, all of which recognize the\r\ninalienable and legitimate right of the Palestinian people to\r\nself-determination and their right to return to their homeland.\r\nThe provisions of General Assembly resolution 194 (III) on\r\nthe right of return for refugees, of resolution 478 (1980) on\r\nJerusalem, of resolution 3375 (XXX) on the right to self-\r\ndetermination and of resolution 799 (1992) on deportees are\r\nonly a few dead letter examples. Despite the recent\r\ndevelopments concerning the question of Palestine, the\r\nposition of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya regarding this issue\r\nand the conflict in the Middle East remains as we have\r\npreviously explained it, and let me now reiterate it: all\r\noccupied Arab territories should be liberated, and the\r\nPalestinian people should be supported until they have\r\nregained all their rights - the foremost of which being their\r\nright to self-determination, their right to return to their land\r\nand their right to establish in Palestine their own State,\r\nwhere both Arabs and Jews can live on an equal footing.\r\nIn another part of the Arab homeland, namely Somalia,\r\nthe situation is still a source of grave concern. Although\r\nearlier efforts were successful in creating a safe environment\r\nfor the distribution of humanitarian relief assistance to those\r\nsuffering from the widespread famine, the recent events,\r\nwhich indicate that the circumstances have changed, show\r\nhow sensitive the situation is in that region. My country,\r\nwhich has closely followed the developments in Somalia,\r\nremains convinced that solutions to problems cannot be\r\nimposed by force regardless of the enforcer. Solutions can\r\nbe found only through dialogue and understanding.\r\nFirst and foremost, the Somalis themselves should\r\nabandon their differences and work together to implement\r\nthe agreements they have reached so that Somalia and its\r\npeople may regain peace, security and stability.\r\nGiven our conviction that peace and security in the\r\nMediterranean region is closely related, not only to security\r\nand cooperation with Africa and Europe, but also to world\r\npeace and security, the strengthening of security and\r\ncooperation in the region is a high priority for the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya. That is the reason why my country\r\nwelcomed General Assembly resolutions in this regard as\r\nwell as the resolutions adopted on the subject by other\r\norganizations, such as the Non-Aligned Movement. Once\r\nagain, we declare that we welcome any and all initiatives\r\naimed at removing the causes of tension, enhancing stability\r\nand expanding cooperation in the region.\r\nMy country is fully cognizant of the fact that the\r\nstrengthening of security and cooperation in the\r\nMediterranean region is a multidimensional issue. However,\r\nwe continue to believe that withdrawal of foreign fleets and\r\nthe closing down of foreign bases in this region constitute\r\nthe essential elements. Such a step would enhance\r\nconfidence-building in the area and channel resources\r\ntowards economic and social development. At the same\r\ntime, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya believes that the use of\r\ndialogue and understanding - on the basis of mutual respect\r\nfor sovereignty and in accordance with international norms\r\nand conventions - to settle differences would also constitute\r\na basic element in restoring security and stability to the\r\nMediterranean region. Moreover, intensified collaboration\r\nand coordination of efforts in areas of common interest\r\nwould further enhance cooperation. For this reason, the\r\nJamahiriya welcomes the steps taken within regional\r\ngroupings such as the Arab Maghreb Union and the Western\r\nMediterranean Grouping (5 + 5), as such steps constitute an\r\nimportant breakthrough towards the realization of peoples’\r\naspirations after peace, security and cooperation.\r\nConcrete progress has been made over the past few\r\nyears in the area of disarmament, especially with regard to\r\nthe reduction of nuclear-weapon stockpiles and accession by\r\nmore countries to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. While it\r\nwelcomes those developments, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\r\ndoes not consider them to be sufficient and believes that the\r\ndanger of nuclear proliferation requires further international\r\nefforts that would lead to the complete elimination of all\r\nweapons of mass destruction in the case of every State that\r\npossesses, produces or stockpiles them. Consequently, my\r\ncountry supports all initiatives aimed at achieving this end,\r\nincluding the enhancement of the United Nations\r\ndisarmament mechanisms and especially the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, whose work has been crowned by the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention. This is an ambitious\r\ndocument on the road to general and complete disarmament.\r\nHowever, my country has so far abstained from signing this\r\nConvention because of the existence in the region we live in\r\nof weapons of mass destruction that are not subject to\r\ninternational safeguards and inspection. Under such\r\ncircumstances, it is difficult to consider the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention without considering other weapons of\r\nmass destruction in the Middle East, mainly nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMy country has supported the call for the establishment\r\nof nuclear-weapon-free zones, including the proposal by the\r\nArab Republic of Egypt which calls for making the Middle\r\nEast an area free of weapons of mass destruction. Based on\r\nmy country’s eagerness to stamp out the dangers of such\r\nweapons and in order to get rid of them, it has called on the\r\nUnited Nations to adopt the necessary measures to destroy\r\nnuclear, bacteriological, chemical and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, such as ballistic missiles, and to prohibit and\r\ncriminalize the development, possession and use of all such\r\nweapons.\r\nThe international family’s current efforts to establish\r\nsecurity and stability in the world, mainly through the\r\nredoubling of efforts to contain political crises and end\r\nregional disputes, should be expanded to embrace economic\r\nproblems as well. The impact of economic problems on\r\ninternational peace and security is not less dangerous than\r\nthat of armed conflicts. According to the 1993 World\r\nEconomic Survey, the world economy continues to stagnate.\r\nIts revitalization requires urgent international measures\r\nwhich would give special attention to the developing\r\ncountries, which suffer from economic difficulties that arise\r\nfrom trade protectionism, large external debts, restrictions on\r\nthe transfer of technology, the reverse flow of resources and\r\nlow commodity prices.\r\nIn the context of the international community’s efforts\r\nto promote economic and social development, my country\r\nwishes to draw attention to the danger of the coercive\r\nmeasures of various forms, to which some developing\r\ncountries, including mine, are being subjected. Such\r\nmeasures constitute one of the main obstacles to\r\ndevelopment and run counter to the Charter, the rules of\r\ninternational law and to all relevant General Assembly\r\nresolutions.\r\nSupport for development efforts also requires the\r\ninternational community to honour its commitments to\r\ncertain development programmes, such as the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nAfrica attaches great hope to this programme because it\r\nwould help promote developmental efforts that began with\r\nthe establishment of Africa’s economic community and have\r\nbeen enhanced by the establishment of a number of\r\nsubregional groupings such as the Arab Maghreb Union,\r\nwhich has taken important steps towards improving the use\r\nof the region’s resources and towards strengthening the\r\nregional ties that would enhance the adoption of common\r\npolicies by its member countries in the political, economic\r\nand social spheres.\r\nLast year’s Earth Summit yielded important results.\r\nWe are satisfied with the measures adopted towards the\r\nrealization of the Conference’s objectives, especially the\r\nbeginnings of a convention to combat drought and\r\ndesertification. This is an extremely important issue for my\r\ncountry and for the whole North Africa region, which suffers\r\nfrom a shortage of water and is threatened by drought and\r\ncreeping desertification. Furthermore, we believe that true\r\ndetermination to protect the environment lies in international\r\ncooperation and in honouring the commitments made at the\r\nRio Conference. Protection of the environment is one of my\r\ncountry’s top priorities. Our first step in combating drought\r\nand desertification is the great man-made river. Our national\r\nplans include the reclamation of thousands of hectares of\r\ndesert for the purpose of agriculture and settlement.\r\nIn this respect, I must inform the Assembly that our\r\nefforts to expand environmental protection and maintenance\r\nare being hampered by the widespread presence of remnants\r\nof war, and of mines that were laid in Libya’s soil during\r\nWorld War II. International and regional organizations have\r\nadopted numerous resolutions in this connection, and the\r\nGeneral Assembly has also adopted similar resolutions, the\r\nlatest of which was resolution 40/197. All those resolutions\r\nhave called upon the countries responsible to provide the\r\ninformation and technical assistance required for the removal\r\nof those mines and other remnants of war, and to pay\r\ncompensation for the damage caused. Today, we call once\r\nagain upon those countries to shoulder their responsibility\r\nand to respond to the calls of the international community\r\nand the United Nations resolutions on the remnants and\r\ndebris of war.\r\nThe adoption of international policies and programmes\r\naimed at ensuring mankind’s well-being and attaining the\r\nbest possible standard of living is one of our objectives. On\r\nthis basis, my country welcomes the convening of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nnext year, and of the World Conference on Women and the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development in 1995. To our\r\nmind, these conferences will give a strong political impetus\r\nto international efforts and activities aimed at stamping out\r\nunderdevelopment, poverty and hunger. In welcoming these\r\nconferences, we are encouraged by the important results\r\nfrom the International Conference on Human Rights. They\r\nare a great achievement in the promotion of respect for\r\nhuman rights and basic freedoms.\r\nMy country which belongs to one of the great cultures\r\nof the world, namely the Arab-Islamic culture that has\r\ncontributed greatly to the promotion of human rights, is\r\ndetermined to continue to support the international\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 9\r\ncommunity’s efforts, deployed through the United Nations\r\nand its organs, in the area of human rights, so that we may\r\nrealize the goals of the Vienna Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action.\r\nGiven its interest in human rights which it considers to\r\nbe the basis for development and prosperity, my country has\r\nworked to achieve and strengthen equality for all its citizens\r\nand to guarantee their rights. This has been stressed in the\r\ngreat green document on human rights and basic freedoms.\r\nThe freedom enhancement act was promulgated in 1991, and\r\na large number of international agreements in the area of\r\nhuman rights have also been ratified. In addition, the\r\nInternational Committee on the Qaddafi Award for Human\r\nRights has been established.\r\nThe restructuring and reform of the United Nations and\r\nthe democratization of the composition of its organs have\r\nbecome a necessity if the United Nations is to be enabled to\r\nmeet international demands, become more responsive to the\r\nneeds of Member States and more effective in its work, in\r\nconsonance with the goals of the Charter.\r\nMy country has been following with interest the current\r\nattempts at reforming the United Nations in the economic\r\nand social fields. We welcome the decision on the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the streamlining\r\nof its agenda. We hope that the ad hoc working group\r\nestablished for this purpose will reach a conclusion that\r\nstrikes a balance between, and safeguards the interests of, all\r\nMember States.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s proposals in his report entitled\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" are a valuable contribution towards\r\nenhancing the Organization’s ability to meet the challenges\r\nof the coming period. My country welcomed those\r\nproposals, and has taken note of the two resolutions adopted\r\nby the General Assembly in this respect.\r\nIn carrying out the recommendations of the Agenda for\r\nPeace, the United Nations should be guided by the principles\r\nof the Charter and especially by its respect for the\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of\r\nStates, as stipulated in resolution 47/120, and confirmed by\r\nresolution 47/233 adopted by the General Assembly just last\r\nmonth. The strengthening of the General Assembly so that\r\nit may perform the role entrusted to it by the Charter should\r\nbe one of the main objectives in reforming the United\r\nNations. The Security Council, which Member States have\r\nentrusted with the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity on their behalf, should carry out its duties in a\r\nmanner that fully conforms with the principles and purposes\r\nof the Charter and with international laws and norms. The\r\nCouncil should also improve its methods of work and adopt\r\nan objective course of action. It should not apply double\r\nstandards when dealing with issues of world peace and\r\nsecurity. The present facts on the ground necessitate an\r\nenlargement of the membership of the Security Council not\r\nthrough partial measures but through radical solutions that\r\nreflect the increase in the membership of the United Nations\r\nand take into consideration equal geographical distribution in\r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the Charter\r\nand the objectives of General Assembly resolution 47/62.\r\nWithin the context of the reform process, it is highly\r\nimportant to review some of the provisions of the Charter\r\nthat are no longer in keeping with the great changes that\r\nhave taken place in the international arena. The world\r\nsituation in 1945 and the situation now are different. This\r\nrequires the adoption of bold measures in relation to certain\r\nprovisions of the Charter whose continued existence\r\nconstitutes a major impediment to the most important role of\r\nthe United Nations, namely, the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Here, we refer to the veto power in the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council, which is held by a very\r\nfew countries. The abolition of this privilege is something\r\nthat has long been called for; calls for abolition have grown\r\nover the last few years. The position expressed by many\r\ncountries, including my country, during the last session of\r\nthe General Assembly and in other forums, confirms the\r\nwidespread desire to abolish this privilege and highlights the\r\nfact that any collective security system that is subject to the\r\nveto power of some countries cannot be depended upon to\r\nmaintain international peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, as we prepare to celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, and as we look forward\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nto the next 50 years, we are duty bound, both as States and\r\nas peoples, to lay down a strong and just foundation for the\r\nworld of tomorrow. The world we aspire to is a world free\r\nfrom conflicts, disputes and wars; a world where the means\r\nof annihilation and destruction do not exist and where the\r\nmanifestations of poverty and suffering have long\r\ndisappeared; a world of security and stability built by people\r\non the basis of virtue, justice and equality, where democracy\r\nand human rights are reinforced by the absence of violence,\r\ninjustice and arbitrary acts; a world where all people have a\r\ngenuine opportunity to look to the future with optimism and\r\nto enjoy peace, security and happiness by truly applying the\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. In\r\ncontributing to the achievement of these goals, the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya put forward a proposal designed to deal\r\nwith and solve many of the problems and issues with which\r\nmankind is preoccupied. That proposal was circulated in\r\ndocument A/46/840 which I shall not address but which is\r\navailable to representatives as an addendum to this\r\nstatement.\r\nMr. GOMBOSUREN (Mongolia): At the outset,\r\npermit me to offer to you, Sir, my delegation’s sincere\r\ncongratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency\r\nof the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your\r\nprofessional experience as your country’s Permanent\r\nRepresentative to the United Nations will undoubtedly be an\r\nasset in our important deliberations.\r\nWe pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev,\r\nfor his dedicated service. We applaud the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his bold and tireless efforts\r\nto strengthen the world Organization. We warmly welcome\r\nthe new Members and wish them well.\r\nA retrospective look at developments since the end of\r\nthe cold war reveals the complexity of advancing towards a\r\nnew fabric of international relations. On the one hand, the\r\nspirit of cooperation and interaction is becoming prevalent.\r\nThe new democracies are making headway in the face of the\r\nformidable difficulties of transition. Recent events in Russia\r\nare ample evidence of this. We are confident that the\r\ndemocratic forces, led by President Yeltsin, will overcome\r\nthe present ordeal and succeed in their endeavours. The\r\nsignificance for the region and the entire world of the\r\nsuccess of Russia’s reforms can hardly be overemphasized.\r\nMr. Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), Vice-Chairman, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nFurthermore, solutions are being found even to the most\r\nprotracted regional conflicts. The recent historic act of\r\nmutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and the interim peace\r\nagreement are a case in point. We hope that this will lead\r\nto a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli\r\nconflict.\r\nAn important breakthrough towards democracy and a\r\nmultiracial society in South Africa has been made. Peace\r\nand the national reconciliation that had eluded Cambodia for\r\nso long has been restored to this land of ancient civilization.\r\nLandmark agreements on the prohibition of chemical\r\nweapons and on the reduction of nuclear armaments have\r\nbeen concluded.\r\nIn the meantime, it is clear that old, deep-seated\r\nproblems still await solutions and new ones, once held in\r\ncheck by the circumstances of the time, are emerging.\r\nIndeed, no tangible progress has been registered in\r\naddressing the issues of poverty, external debt, drugs,\r\norganized crime, the widening gap between the affluent and\r\nthe poor, and environmental crises. Though the cold war is\r\nover, the \"hot wars\" have multiplied. Suffice it to mention\r\nthe continuing tragedies of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nSomalia, Nagorny-Karabakh and Abkhazia.\r\nIt is widely recognized today that the concept of\r\ndevelopment has acquired a multidimensional character\r\nencompassing not only economic growth, but also political,\r\nsocial and environmental aspects. Moreover, greater\r\nemphasis is being placed on the human dimension of\r\ndevelopment, as in the final analysis the well-being of\r\npeople stands as a true measurement of development. We\r\nbelieve that the United Nations is the only, and irreplaceable,\r\nmechanism to translate this concept into reality.\r\nIn this respect, the United Nations-sponsored world\r\nconferences on population and on women and the World\r\nSummit for Social Development are called upon to open up\r\nbetter prospects to that end. No lasting solution to today’s\r\nvarious problems can be sought unless the developmental\r\nchallenges are adequately addressed. The concept of\r\ndevelopment and its practical aspects will certainly be\r\nenriched by the Secretary-General’s interim report on an\r\nagenda for development and its upcoming discussion during\r\nthis session.\r\nNow is the time resolutely to address the long-standing\r\nagenda relating to economic disparities between the North\r\nand the South, including eradication of poverty, debt relief,\r\nelimination of trade protectionism and an early and\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. In this regard,\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 11\r\nMongolia welcomes the meeting of the Chairman of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of Seven last July in\r\nTokyo, which represents a first step towards re-launching the\r\nNorth-South dialogue. My delegation believes it important\r\nthat following serious consideration by the Assembly, at this\r\nsession, of the Non-Aligned Movement initiative on the\r\nreactivation of the North-South dialogue to strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation for development a positive decision\r\nbe taken in this regard.\r\nIt is of signal importance that we maintain the\r\nmomentum gained at the Rio Conference on Environment\r\nand Development through effective follow-up, at both the\r\ninternational and the national level. We commend the\r\ndynamic role of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment as a central political forum for the monitoring\r\nand review of the implementation of Agenda 21. Mongolia\r\nrecently ratified the Convention on Climate Change and the\r\nConvention on Biodiversity; our national plan of action to\r\nimplement Agenda 21 is being formulated.\r\nAs a country where desertification is a major challenge,\r\nMongolia deems it necessary that a convention on that\r\nsubject be concluded by 1995.\r\nMongolia believes that the observance of human rights\r\nin accordance with universally accepted norms is essential in\r\npromoting equitable cooperation among States. Respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms can in no way be\r\nreconciled with biased criteria which divide countries into\r\nbig and small, developed and underdeveloped, majority and\r\nminority groups, or along ethnic, racial and religious lines.\r\nFurthermore, Mongolia proceeds from the premise that\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, as universal values,\r\ndo not recognize borders.\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that the Vienna\r\nConference on Human Rights, held last June, was able to\r\nreach an agreement on the indivisibility of economic, social,\r\ncultural, political and civil rights, and on the need to respect\r\nand implement them on an equal footing.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that with the demise of the cold\r\nwar, propaganda on disarmament issues has faded away and\r\na businesslike atmosphere of cooperation has taken shape.\r\nEarlier this year the Treaty on substantive reductions of\r\nstrategic offensive armaments was concluded between the\r\nRussian Federation and the United States. Also, a\r\ncommendable initiative with respect to a moratorium on\r\nnuclear testing took shape. The Geneva Conference on\r\nDisarmament has decided to commence negotiations on a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty.\r\nAs a country uniquely positioned between the two\r\nnuclear-weapon Powers, Mongolia attaches exceptional\r\nimportance to this issue. That is precisely why my country\r\nlast year declared its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nIn this context Mongolia welcomes the idea of turning\r\nCentral Asia into such a zone.\r\nThe issue of the timely and full implementation of\r\nagreements on the reduction of nuclear weapons and the\r\ncomplete prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons\r\nshould not escape the priority attention of the world\r\ncommunity. The cessation of nuclear-weapon tests and the\r\nstrict observance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) is acquiring special importance.\r\nWe support the indefinite extension of the NPT at the review\r\nConference in 1995. It is of great importance that the\r\nparties to the Treaty, especially the nuclear-weapon States,\r\nhonour their commitments and refrain from any action that\r\nmight undermine it.\r\nMongolia is entering its fourth year of democratic\r\nreforms. We, like many others in our position, are facing\r\nformidable challenges. As an underdeveloped, land-locked\r\ncountry inadequately integrated into the world transportation\r\nnetwork, with a high vulnerability to natural calamities,\r\nMongolia is experiencing added difficulties in its transition.\r\nIn addition to the political and economic reforms there\r\nis the onerous task of dealing with spiritual renewal. During\r\nthe years of the socialist experiment, we Mongols were\r\nforced to abandon our centuries-old traditions and cultural\r\nheritage. Suffice it to say that virtually all the houses of\r\nworship - sanctuaries of spiritual life - over 700 in all, were\r\ndestroyed, and the traditional script of the Mongols, an\r\nimportant cultural heritage of mankind, was buried in\r\noblivion. The task is now to rectify this wrong. This is a\r\nnation-wide task requiring enormous efforts and resources;\r\nwe cannot leave it to take care of itself.\r\nFor all the problems, Mongolia’s democratic reforms\r\nare steadily gaining ground. The new democratic system of\r\ngovernance proclaimed in the 1992 democratic Constitution\r\nis being consolidated. The first-ever direct presidential\r\nelections, held last June, culminated in the choice of a\r\nPresident put forward by the new political parties. The legal\r\nfoundation of the ongoing reforms is being strengthened. It\r\nhas come to embrace all the key aspects of societal life.\r\nThe present Government has set itself the task of\r\nchecking the economic decline within a two-year period.\r\nAnd the target seems to be within the realm of the possible.\r\nWe associate these gains primarily with the understanding\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nand support of the international community. In recent years\r\na donor community in support of Mongolia has emerged. A\r\ndonor meeting sponsored recently by the World Bank held\r\nits third round in Tokyo, in which 23 countries and 6\r\ninternational organizations took part. Grants and soft loans\r\nby donor Governments significantly help in alleviating the\r\npresent difficulties, and lay a new basis for future\r\ndevelopment. In addition, we are keenly interested in\r\nattracting private-sector investment in Mongolia. This would\r\nnot only contribute to economic recovery but would also\r\nhelp make future cooperation with our partners mutually\r\nadvantageous. The revised Foreign Investment Law creates\r\nfavourable conditions for such investment opportunities.\r\nFurthermore, we consider that active involvement in\r\nregional economic cooperation is an essential factor in\r\nfulfilling the tasks of transition. With this in mind, we are\r\ninterested, for instance, in becoming a member of the Asia-\r\nPacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC). We hope\r\nthat the States members of that organization will find it\r\npossible to understand and support our position.\r\nThe United Nations has emerged as an important focal\r\npoint of international efforts and has assumed greatly\r\nincreased responsibilities in the areas of peacemaking,\r\npeace-keeping and peace-building. The detailed report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization is a lucid\r\nillustration of that point.\r\nMongolia fully supports the efforts designed to reform\r\nthe United Nations, especially to restructure and revitalize\r\nthe activities of the General Assembly and to ensure that the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council reflects the changing\r\nrealities of the day and the dramatically increased\r\nmembership of the world Organization.\r\nToday, the United Nations is wrestling with many\r\nproblems and trying hard to ensure that it is able to meet the\r\nmany challenges of a rapidly changing world. It goes\r\nwithout saying that the success of this undertaking will\r\ndepend on painstaking efforts and, above all, on the political\r\nwill and greater realism of Member States.\r\nMr. ROMULO (Philippines): I am most pleased to\r\nconvey to Ambassador Insanally my congratulations and\r\nthose of my delegation on his election as President of\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. At the same time, I wish\r\nto express our sincere appreciation to Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\r\nBulgaria for guiding with skill and dedication the work of\r\nthe Assembly at its previous session.\r\nLet me pay a tribute to our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the vision and the energy he\r\nhas devoted to the leadership of our Organization at a\r\ndifficult but exhilarating moment in history.\r\nAllow me to express at this point the deep sympathies\r\nof my delegation for the people of India in connection with\r\nthe tragedy visited upon them by the earthquake that\r\ndevastated parts of the state of Maharashtra.\r\nThe President is presiding over the work of the\r\nAssembly in a world that continues its amazing political\r\ntransformation. Since we met in this same Hall last year, a\r\nperiod that is but the twinkling of an eye in the long history\r\nof mankind, the world’s political landscape has been further\r\nand radically transformed. That transformation is, above all,\r\nreflected in and exemplified by two of the major\r\npreoccupations that have exercised the Assembly and the\r\ninternational community for decades - namely, the situation\r\nin South Africa and the problem of Palestine.\r\nThe abhorrent system of apartheid, long the evil\r\nfoundation of the South African State, has finally crumbled\r\nbecause of the unremitting efforts of the people of South\r\nAfrica and of the international community, not least of the\r\nUnited Nations. In its place, multiracial negotiations - in\r\nthemselves an amazing phenomenon in that country - have\r\nled to a specific programme with a precise timetable for the\r\nconversion of South Africa, in the words recently uttered in\r\nthis Hall by that authentic leader of the South African\r\npeople, Nelson Mandela, \"into a united, democratic,\r\nnon-racial and non-sexist country\".\r\nThe whole situation in the Middle East, too, has been\r\ntransformed, a transformation symbolized by a single\r\nhandshake in Washington. That historic gesture resulted\r\nfrom complex combinations of circumstances and\r\ndevelopments and presages further arduous negotiations and\r\ndetermined efforts by the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and\r\ntheir neighbours. But there is now, more than ever before,\r\nreason to trust that in that long-afflicted part of the world the\r\npolitics of intolerance, hatred and despair is being replaced\r\nby the politics of accommodation, enlightenment,\r\npragmatism and hope.\r\nThus, the international community’s political agenda,\r\nand the substance and content, if not the item-titles, of the\r\nAssembly’s agenda, have radically changed.\r\nThe global economy is being transformed no less\r\nradically. Everywhere, obsolete obstacles to trade are\r\ncoming down, if not yet globally, then within the various\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 13\r\nregions of the world. To be sure, economic barriers\r\ncontinue to be propped up by atavistic hands that seek to\r\nreverse the tide and hold back the march of global economic\r\nprogress. The most obvious victim of these rearguard\r\nactions is the Uruguay Round, which, after years of\r\nfrustrating negotiations and painstaking bargaining, has yet\r\nto come to a conclusion. The ultimate victims are the global\r\neconomy and the livelihoods and standards of living of the\r\nworld’s peoples. Here, the accusing finger of history points\r\nat certain developed countries, with their short-sighted\r\nsubsidies and protectionist devices. Nevertheless, the trend\r\ntowards trade and economic liberalization gathers\r\nmomentum. More and more nations recognize that that\r\ntrend can be reversed only at the peril of the well-being of\r\nthe world’s peoples.\r\nOur region of South-East Asia has been a vital part of\r\nthe global political and economic transformation.\r\nThe conflict in Cambodia and the agony of the\r\nCambodian people long preoccupied this Assembly as well\r\nas the Security Council. Going beyond the expectations of\r\nso many, the Cambodian people have made their historic\r\ndecision for peace and reconciliation. We now call upon the\r\ninternational community to extend its support to the\r\nCambodian people and their new Government so that they\r\nwill find surcease not only from war, but also from poverty\r\nand want, and so that they will find not only peace, but a\r\nlife of dignity and freedom.\r\nThe Declaration by the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) on the South China Sea, which was issued\r\nin Manila last year, has received the strong endorsement of\r\nthe United Nations and of individual Governments, and we\r\nin South-East Asia have continued our measured effort to\r\nbuild a regime of peace, cooperation and mutual confidence\r\nin that disputed area.\r\nEarlier this year we in ASEAN, joined by the other\r\nnations of East Asia, including Viet Nam and Laos, and by\r\nothers with interests in the region, agreed upon an ASEAN\r\nRegional Forum in which questions of regional security can\r\nbe periodically examined and discussed together.\r\nIn East Asia, the rapid advance of economic\r\nliberalization has propelled the economies of the region to\r\nachieve some of the highest growth rates in the world. The\r\ncommitment to the free market has found its most forceful\r\nexpression in the decision of ASEAN’s leaders to establish\r\nan ASEAN Free Trade Area through the steady reduction\r\nand eventual elimination of trade barriers within ASEAN.\r\nHappily, the dawning of a new era of peace and the\r\npromise of prosperity in our region have found a bright\r\nreflection in my country. President Ramos’ policy of\r\nnational unity and reconciliation has replaced the politics of\r\ndivision. Dissident elements have been drawn back into the\r\nfold of society. Peace talks with the remaining disaffected\r\ngroups are being held. Amnesty has been offered to all.\r\nThe economics of selfishness and greed is being\r\nreplaced with reforms to secure economic fairness and social\r\njustice. The Philippine economy is ruled no longer by the\r\ntyranny of excessive regulation or of corporate monopoly but\r\nby the invigorating regime of market forces and free\r\ncompetition.Global competitiveness, in place of political\r\ncontention, is now the watchword throughout the land.\r\nAll this is being carried out with the most meticulous\r\nrespect for human rights in accordance with the national\r\nconsensus and the deepest convictions of our people. It is\r\nbeing achieved within the framework of our democratic\r\ninstitutions. For we are convinced that there is no substitute\r\nfor respect for human rights and democracy in the\r\nachievement of long-term stability and progress, as well as\r\nin the assurance of human dignity and the fulfilment of\r\nhuman aspirations.\r\nThe new situation in the world gives us new hope and\r\na brighter promise. But grave dangers and tragic situations\r\nremain. Old scourges continue to torment the human family;\r\nnew agonies confront it.\r\nReligious intolerance and the rise of nationalist\r\nambitions have supplanted ideological fanaticism as the fuel\r\nfor the fires of conflict that now burn in too many places in\r\nthe world. The collapse of empires has let loose the savage\r\nimpulse to settle historical scores, redress ancient ethnic\r\ngrievances, and set right real or imagined injustices over\r\nnational borders, the treatment of minorities, or the control\r\nof resources.\r\nThe tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the\r\nworst and most dangerous of these barbarities.\r\nDespite - in certain cases, because of - the onset of a\r\nclimate of peace, trafficking in the weapons of war\r\nsometimes continues unabated, dissipating resources,\r\nendangering people, imperilling the peace. The Philippines\r\nsteadfastly supports measures to promote greater\r\ntransparency in arms transfers and military expenditures,\r\nincluding the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms.\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe Philippines urges the nuclear-weapon States, in the\r\nstrongest terms, to restore the recently broken moratorium on\r\nall nuclear testing, and hopes that the international\r\ncommunity will decide, through a comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty, to cease for ever the testing of nuclear devices, which\r\nso gravely threaten the very existence of the human family.\r\nThe Philippines favours the extension of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and calls upon all to\r\nabide strictly by its provisions, including the safeguards\r\nagreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nAt the same time, we urge the nuclear-weapon States to\r\nfulfil their own obligations under the Treaty and further\r\nreduce their stocks of such weapons until they are no more.\r\nAmid the rising tide of economic liberalization, the\r\nsiren song of protectionism continues to entice nations with\r\nits fraudulent promise. Legitimate concerns over health,\r\nfood safety, the environment, workers’ welfare, and even\r\nhuman rights, including the rights of indigenous peoples -\r\nand now \"social dumping\" - are being invoked to clothe in\r\nvarious guises policies of naked protectionism.\r\nDecisions on global finance continue to be made by a\r\nfew, with the rest of the world standing by even though it is\r\nvitally affected. The burden of foreign debt continues to be\r\na millstone round the necks of many developing countries,\r\nand the problem is often aggravated by decisions on interest\r\nrates and exchange rates in which those countries have no\r\nvoice.\r\nThe Philippines continues faithfully to fulfil its external\r\nfinancial obligations, regardless of the extent to which that\r\npolicy holds back our economic growth, constitutes a burden\r\non our people, and imposes a heavy domestic political cost\r\non our leaders. But we wonder whether the world has tried\r\nhard enough to devise creative solutions to this economic\r\nplague upon the developing countries. After all, some\r\nnations have been favoured with decisive - even radical -\r\nmeasures to alleviate their foreign debt, such measures\r\nhaving become politically useful to the creditor countries.\r\nThe ravages that the profligacy of man has wrought\r\nupon the Earth’s delicate environment continue to endanger\r\nour fragile planet and many nations. The Philippines has\r\nkept faith with the commitments made by us all at the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment because of its conviction that development\r\ncannot be sustained if the world’s - and the\r\ncountry’s - natural riches and the balance between them are\r\ndestroyed.\r\nNo less destructive is the accelerating increase in the\r\nillicit trafficking in drugs, which destroys the lives of our\r\npeople in the vigour of their youth. It gives rise to\r\nlawlessness and crime. It knows no national boundaries.\r\nWe therefore appeal for the full and effective\r\nimplementation of the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme and the Global Programme of Action.\r\nIn situations of conflict, women, as well as children,\r\nbecome the most tragic victims by virtue of their inherent\r\nvulnerability. The systematic rape and murder of women\r\nand girls in Bosnia and Herzegovina is only the most\r\noutrageous instance of this abhorrent reality.\r\nSimilarly, in situations of extreme poverty, women -\r\nparticularly migrant workers - are the most vulnerable to\r\nabuse. Detached from the family, away from their\r\nhomeland, often living in their employer’s home, unprotected\r\nby the country where they work, women migrant workers are\r\nespecially susceptible to maltreatment. The abuses to which\r\nthey are exposed, and often subjected, are a veritable litany\r\nof woe - denial of their rightful wages, excessive deductions\r\nby their employment agencies, intolerably long working\r\nhours, insufficient food, lack of medical care, the absence of\r\nany avenue for the redress of their grievances, physical\r\nattack, rape and other forms of sexual abuse.\r\nWe call upon the Assembly to keep among the areas of\r\nits concern the condition of women, who make up half of\r\nthe world - in particular, the migrant workers among them.\r\nAnd we call upon the Governments concerned to enact laws\r\nand other measures for the protection of these migrant\r\nworkers. We ask these Governments to cease the callous\r\ntreatment of migrant workers as commodities that are subject\r\nonly to the law of supply and demand.\r\nThese scourges of mankind - mass poverty, external\r\ndebt, environmental damage, illicit drugs, abuses against\r\nwomen, the mistreatment of migrant workers - would be\r\nmore effectively addressed if Governments, societies and the\r\ninternational community were to place people at the centre\r\nof development and international cooperation. This is what\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development is intended to do.\r\nWe urge the world’s leaders and their Governments to\r\nensure maximum participation in this milestone event in\r\nCopenhagen in 1995.\r\nThe world has changed radically, largely for the better.\r\nBut old problems remain, and new challenges confront us.\r\nTo respond to these problems under the new circumstances,\r\nand to deal with these new challenges, our Organization, the\r\nUnited Nations, must renew itself.\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 15\r\nIn few aspects of the work of the United Nations is this\r\nneed for renewal more evident than in the Security Council.\r\nThe structure of the Security Council was formulated at the\r\nvery birth of the United Nations, at the end of the Second\r\nWorld War and the beginning of the cold war. Forty-eight\r\nyears have passed. Massive changes have occurred in the\r\nworld, particularly in recent years. Empires have crumbled.\r\nThe ideological division of the world has melted away. The\r\ncold war has ended. The membership of the United Nations\r\nhas multiplied from 51 at the time of its founding to 184\r\ntoday.\r\nAnd yet, apart from the enlargement of its membership\r\n30 years ago from 9 nine to 15, the Security Council has not\r\nchanged. It has remained small, unrepresentative,\r\nundemocratic, opaque. We recognize the reality of\r\ncontinuing imbalances in world power and the necessity for\r\nthe Security Council to reflect this reality. But, surely, we\r\nmust also recognize the reality of the worldwide trend\r\ntowards, and the people’s desire for, democratization and\r\ntransparency in political affairs. Surely, the Security\r\nCouncil, the United Nations body with the greatest impact\r\non international peace and security, must also reflect this\r\nreality in its size, in its structure, in its procedures, in its\r\nrelations with other United Nations bodies, including the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe are, therefore, in favour of a searching reassessment\r\nof the structure, role and procedures of the Security Council\r\nwith a view to its reform. And we urge that, in view of the\r\nrepercussions that such a reform would have on other United\r\nNations bodies and activities, this reassessment be carried\r\nout within the context of a thorough review of the Charter.\r\nThe sober, rational and\r\nrealistic proposals propounded yesterday by the Foreign\r\nMinister of Singapore might serve as a useful starting-point\r\nfor our consideration of this important matter.\r\nThe entire United Nations is, in fact, in need of reform.\r\nIn the new international situation, the enlarged demands\r\nupon the United Nations and the constraints on the available\r\nmeans require that the resources of the United Nations be\r\ncarefully husbanded for their most efficient use. The\r\nconcept and substance of management - and by that I mean\r\nthe science of management - must be imposed upon the\r\nUnited Nations bureaucracy. Funds and other assets must be\r\nmost meticulously safeguarded and effectively utilized.\r\nDuplication must be avoided, costs drastically cut, waste\r\nradically reduced, and corruption abolished.\r\nI am sure that many developing countries share our\r\ndesire that the United Nations should impose upon itself the\r\nausterity and discipline that are required of many of us by\r\nthe international financial institutions.\r\nWe pay a tribute to the Secretary-General’s attention to\r\nthis aspect of his work. We welcome in particular the\r\ncreation of the new post of Assistant Secretary-General for\r\nInspections and Investigations as an indication of his\r\ndetermination to address this problem.\r\nThe Philippines is up to date in its contribution to the\r\nfinances of the United Nations. It may be a small amount\r\nin the totality of the Organization’s resources, but it is\r\nsubstantial in proportion to our financial capacity. We\r\nwould not want to see it squandered. We cannot afford it.\r\nNeither can the United Nations.\r\nMay I propose, then, that a group of men and women\r\nwith both extensive experience and skill in corporate\r\nmanagement and extensive exposure to the special\r\nrequirements and problems of the United Nations be\r\ncommissioned to study this question in greater depth and\r\ndetail and with greater objectivity, and to make the\r\nappropriate recommendations. There are many in this Hall\r\nright now who would be eminently qualified to perform this\r\ntask. The Philippines will explore the possibility of a draft\r\nresolution to this effect at a suitable time.\r\nThis is a matter of great and urgent necessity. For\r\nreforms in the United Nations will place the Organization in\r\na better position to deal with the demands upon it in the\r\nsecond half-century of its existence and to fulfil in the next\r\nmillennium the vision that its founding fathers had for this\r\ngreat and indispensable Organization.\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMr. KARABAYEV (Kyrgyzstan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): I wish to begin by congratulating the President\r\nand the other officers of the Assembly on their election to\r\ntheir high, responsible posts and by wishing them every\r\nsuccess in their work, which will certainly yield positive\r\nresults for us all.\r\nThe end of the twentieth century will go down in\r\nhistory as the period in which the cold war came to an end\r\nand which saw the dawn of a new world, a period of new\r\nopportunities to do things that only yesterday would have\r\ntaken a miracle to achieve. It is enough to recall the historic\r\nagreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO), the reductions in nuclear and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction, and, for my country,\r\nsomething that seemed impossible only very recently: the\r\nachievement of the high degree of sovereignty that permits\r\nus to speak from the rostrum of the General Assembly Hall.\r\nI represent a small country that can be viewed as an\r\noasis of democracy. But that is not strictly accurate: we are\r\nhardly surrounded by an empty wasteland. We are trying to\r\nfind our place in a new, complex world. In that quest we\r\nare guided by the following definitions: In the political\r\nsphere, our quest means pluralism, allowing the existence of\r\nvaried ideologies and parties that do not espouse violence or\r\nextremism; in the economic sphere, it means a policy\r\ndesigned to achieve a multi-faceted social market economy,\r\nwith equal rights and freedoms for all economic entities; in\r\nthe social sphere, it means a policy of self-reliance\r\nprotecting the most vulnerable sectors of our population; in\r\nthe legal sphere, it means legal safeguards for the interests\r\nof all citizens, economic entities, parties and movements, as\r\nwell as for the State; in the area of religion, it means\r\ntolerance and the application of ethical principles; in the\r\nsphere of building the structures of State authority, it means\r\nforming coalition groups with broad participation by officials\r\nfrom many parties and movements.\r\nThe linchpin of our policy is acknowledgement of the\r\npriority of humanitarian values and of the natural right of the\r\nindividual to happiness. The new Constitution of\r\nKyrgyzstan clearly lays down these basic principles, through\r\nwhich we are attempting, in spite of difficulties, to establish\r\nour chosen State model.\r\nMy purpose in this statement is not just to give an idea\r\nof our Republic’s political prospects. I shall try to take a\r\nbroader approach to issues; perhaps to some extent this is a\r\nprerequisite for our acknowledgement by the world\r\ncommunity. The process of the victory of democracy in\r\nKyrgyzstan, and in the other Republics of the former Soviet\r\nUnion, seems paradoxical and almost irrational.\r\nRevolutionary changes have taken place at the top levels of\r\nthe political elite. These changes were welcomed, as I see\r\nit, primarily because by that time we had already achieved\r\nthe democratic victory of glasnost. What happened could be\r\nexpressed as follows: the storming of the Bastille was\r\npreceded by The Marriage of Figaro. Our reforms began\r\nnot with the economy but with politics. How could it be\r\notherwise, since Kyrgyzstan had no elements of a market\r\neconomy, and property ownership was distorted?\r\nKyrgyzstan today is one of the few independent States of the\r\nformer Soviet Union to have adopted and be carrying out a\r\nprogramme of economic reforms for transition to a market\r\neconomy, as approved by the International Monetary Fund\r\nand the World Bank.\r\nFor a number of objective reasons pertaining to the\r\nstructure of production and current shortages of energy\r\nsources, such as oil and gas, implementation of\r\nrecommendations for our Republic has caused us social and\r\neconomic difficulties. Our country has a dire need for\r\nmedicines, and a balanced diet is lacking. Thousands and\r\nthousands of young people are coming into the cities from\r\nthe villages without any real professional training or any\r\nchance of prospering. Furthermore, we cannot yet give our\r\neconomy the necessary impetus to enable us quickly to solve\r\nthese and other major social problems. We need investment.\r\nLike other relatively small countries, we need a kind of\r\nMarshall Plan. The experience of many States has shown\r\nthat this would be profitable for the wealthy countries and\r\ndonors in many ways.\r\nI would not venture to say that, but for my firm\r\nconviction that the ability to empathize with the suffering of\r\nothers has always been a strong point of the United Nations;\r\nin fact, it is what has given it its high standing in the eyes\r\nof the world. This is not a case of political parasitism. We\r\nfirmly intend to pay off all of our debts, and we fully\r\nrecognize that the usefulness of these policies can be\r\nmeasured only by mutual advantage, and that the results of\r\nany foreign policy activity, including the economic aspects,\r\ndepend on the participation of others and the ability to pay,\r\nin the broad sense of the words.\r\nFor the world community, for large and small countries,\r\none thing is becoming more evident: there exists not only\r\neconomic power, the power of gold and production, not only\r\nbrute military power, but also spiritual power. I am talking\r\nnot about the cruel, soulless and heartless fanaticism of some\r\npeople, not about trends and faiths whose history is written\r\nin blood, but about lofty and pure ethical values which bind\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 17\r\ntogether people who espouse them. These values and ideals\r\nare the moral postulates of religion.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nI wish to draw attention to what I regard as a special\r\ntopic. We have been witnessing tragic conflicts with\r\nreligious roots. One possible solution to this problem would\r\nbe to adopt a universal convention on freedom of religion,\r\nwhich would call upon people of different faiths to apply\r\nethical and moral principles for the sake of peace and\r\nharmony.\r\nThe United Nations is recognized to be a universal\r\nOrganization, and as such not to be at variance with other\r\ninstitutions of the world community. No, it is in those\r\ninstitutions, in the specialized agencies and regional\r\norganizations, that we find the embodiment of the ideals and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations. With this in view, I would\r\nlike to draw attention to the problem of establishing a\r\ncollective security system in Asia. In principle, the\r\ndelegation of Kyrgyzstan agrees with what previous speakers\r\nhave said in this regard. On the other hand, a collective\r\nsecurity system in Asia cannot be established quickly, or as\r\nquickly as might be hoped. In this connection, no doubt the\r\nbest we can do is to ask the Secretary-General to conduct a\r\nstudy, which could give us useful guidelines for future work\r\non such an important problem.\r\nNaturally, I have covered only a few issues, against the\r\nbackdrop of upheavals in the political and social life of the\r\nworld today. But I still hope that I have drawn attention to\r\nmajor issues of interest to us all.\r\nEvery State whose representative has addressed the\r\nAssembly has made recommendations, and further valuable\r\nrecommendations and proposals will be made, based on the\r\nhigh ideals of our Organization, whose focal point should be\r\nthe individual and his or her prosperity and happiness. We\r\nfully agree with these proposals and hope that the creative\r\nenergy involved will not be self-destructive.\r\nORGANIZATION OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Members will recall that at the\r\n14th plenary meeting, on 4 October, I drew their attention to\r\ndocument A/INF/48/6, which contains a tentative programme\r\nof work and schedule of plenary meetings for the month of\r\nOctober. I also announced that the lists of speakers for all\r\nthe items listed in document A/INF/48/6 were open.\r\nThree of the agenda items scheduled for consideration\r\nin October are agenda item 10, \"Report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization\"; agenda item 11,\r\n\"Report of the Security Council\"; and agenda item 13,\r\n\"Report of the International Court of Justice\".\r\nIn connection with those items, I should like to remind\r\nmembers that the General Assembly, in paragraph 5 of\r\nresolution 47/233 of 17 August 1993 on the revitalization of\r\nthe work of the General Assembly, encouraged Member\r\nStates to participate actively in a substantive and in-depth\r\ndiscussion on, and consideration of, the reports of the\r\nSecurity Council and other principal organs of the United\r\nNations, in order to fulfil the relevant provisions of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nI should also like to inform members that a draft\r\nresolution on the lifting of sanctions against South Africa,\r\nissued as document A/48/L.2, is now available at the\r\ndocuments distribution centre in the General Assembly Hall.\r\nFinally, may I say that in response to the concerns\r\nexpressed earlier in the Assembly regarding documentation\r\nand services for the future work not only of the Assembly,\r\nbut of our Committees, I addressed a letter to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on this matter, and following that we had\r\ndiscussions with Secretariat officials. I am led to believe\r\nthat there will be a review of the limit set for documents.\r\nConsultations are now going on between the Secretariat and\r\nMissions to determine each Mission’s needs. In this process\r\nof cooperation we may be able to respect the need for\r\nefficiency but at the same time ensure that Missions receive\r\nthe necessary documents to guarantee the continuation of our\r\nwork.\r\nAn effort will also be made to increase the number of\r\nmeetings from the 53 slated, to cater for needs as they arise,\r\nand special consideration will be given to meetings of the\r\nFifth Committee and the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions, which are essential\r\nto the formulation of a budget for the Assembly. At the\r\nsame time we will do everything possible to see that our\r\nworking hours do not extend beyond 6 p.m., and certainly\r\nnot to weekends, unless absolutely necessary.\r\nEvery effort will be made to ensure that documents are\r\ncirculated in all languages, although it will not be possible\r\nto guarantee that they are distributed simultaneously. In any\r\ncase, documents will be distributed in the working\r\nlanguages, French and English, to meet our needs.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nFinally, in order to ensure that we can monitor the\r\nsituation so that our work is adequately prepared for, we will\r\narrange for coordination between me, the Chairmen of the\r\nCommittees and the Secretariat on a weekly basis to ensure\r\nthat the situation is kept under constant review.\r\nI thought I would mention this in response to the\r\nconcerns expressed last week and to calm the fears that may\r\nstill exist in the Hall with regard to our future meetings.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. MUNGRA (Suriname): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Suriname, I take\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming you, Sir, to the presidency of\r\nthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. You bring\r\nto your high office great experience as a skilled diplomat,\r\nexperience which will be useful in this epoch-making period\r\nfor the Organization. Indeed, your election is a fitting\r\ntribute to you personally and an honour to your country. We\r\nare therefore most gratified to see a skilled and a\r\ndistinguished son of our good neighbour, Guyana, presiding\r\nover our deliberations.\r\nWe thank your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\r\nBulgaria, for the excellent manner in which he conducted the\r\naffairs of the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts in consolidating\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nBefore proceeding, I should like to express the feelings\r\nof sincere sympathy of the Government and people of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname to the Government and people of the\r\nRepublic of India on the sad occasion of the tragic\r\nearthquake disaster in which so many lives were lost. I\r\nappeal to the international community to render the\r\nnecessary effective support to India to alleviate the sorrow\r\nand suffering of the people involved.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to add to what\r\nnumerous previous speakers have already said on behalf of\r\nthe many people living in areas whose development\r\ndifficulties, and their consequences, do not receive enough\r\nattention, because of the high priority given to issues of\r\ninternational peace and security. I am referring to\r\ndeveloping areas that risk being forgotten, though they are\r\ninhabited by people who truly pursue welfare, well-being\r\nand prosperity, and seek true participation in the world\r\ncommunity, where the principle of power will ultimately\r\nmake way for the principle of interdependence within the\r\ninternational system.\r\nCountries in the developed North usually succeed in\r\nstrengthening their mutual relations in political and economic\r\nareas, and they are becoming increasingly interdependent.\r\nThanks to a greater environmental awareness, we are\r\nbecoming increasingly conscious that North and South\r\ndepend strongly on one another. This interdependence,\r\nunfortunately, has not yet evolved sufficiently with regard to\r\npolitical and economic questions, and the views held by the\r\nNorth and the South on many essential issues, such as the\r\nalleviation of poverty and economic development, are still\r\nstrongly divergent. Moreover, the interests of the North in\r\nmany ways still prevail over those of the South.\r\nIn particular, the financial and technological dependence\r\nof the South on the North causes serious divergences. The\r\ndiscriminatory regulations that make it difficult for the South\r\nto gain access to international markets and the ever-changing\r\nconditions that make the flow of funds to the South almost\r\nimpossible are, inter alia, factors that make the gap with the\r\nNorth almost unbridgeable.\r\nIn the past, agreements on multilateral and international\r\ncooperation, such as the International Development Strategy\r\nfor the Fourth United Nations Development Decade, the\r\nCartagena Commitment, Agenda 21 and the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s,\r\nhave been approved by the international community. Those\r\ncommitments constitute a solid basis for strengthening global\r\npartnership for development. However, various programmes\r\ncould not be implemented, and much still remains to be done\r\nto enhance multilateral cooperation.\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 19\r\nLike many developing countries, Suriname has a serious\r\nshortage of external funds for its development process,\r\ndespite its relative wealth of mineralogical and biological\r\nresources.\r\nCertainly, we have succeeded, through maximum\r\nmobilization of our national forces, in coping with the\r\npolitical crisis that dominated the country in the 1980s, and\r\nSuriname has been able to join the countries of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean that have managed to give\r\nmeaning to the process of democratization. It is our joint\r\nresponsibility to see that this momentum is preserved and\r\nthat the euphoria of the victory of democracy over\r\ndictatorship, particularly in our region, does not have adverse\r\neffects.\r\nWithout broad-based development in our countries we\r\nshall not be able to provide democracy with a sound basis.\r\nFor the democratic ideal is not an isolated political\r\nphenomenon, but one that is closely interwoven with the\r\nwhole of the social and economic reality in our part of the\r\nworld.\r\nWithout alleviation of the pressing debt burden, without\r\nan appropriate recompense for our most important export\r\nproducts, without credit facilities for the necessary\r\nproduction inputs, without an expansion of export\r\npossibilities and without the financial support of the richer\r\ncountries, endeavours to realize a stable democratic\r\nconstitutional State will prove to be in vain. We have\r\nnoticed - not without concern - that in their attitudes towards\r\ndeveloping countries some developed countries ignore the\r\nspecific circumstances of those countries, which have fallen\r\nseriously behind in their development.\r\nThe political crisis which Suriname went through in the\r\n1980s, and Suriname’s related isolation from the important\r\ndonors, caused a serious decline in the economic\r\ndevelopment of the country, which was further aggravated\r\nby the drastic reduction of the country’s income from its\r\nmain export products - more specifically, alumina and\r\naluminium.\r\nIn order to meet the resulting financial, economic and\r\nmonetary crisis, we drafted a structural adjustment\r\nprogramme, which is now being implemented. We are\r\naware that, despite the many theories and analyses in this\r\nfield, there exists no blueprint for the resolution of economic\r\ncrises that can be applied smoothly inasmuch as the object\r\nof adjustment is a very complex reality.\r\nMy Government is also aware that achieving economic\r\nrecovery and furthering development while at the same time\r\nsafeguarding political stability is no easy task and must be\r\napproached quite prudently. It is a process which will entail\r\nincreased poverty, and can lead to a serious disruption of\r\nsocial life in the short term. Unfortunately, the divergent\r\nviews held by Suriname’s authorities and by the donors on\r\nthe proper way to implement the adjustment programme puts\r\ngreat pressure on the space necessary for a policy which\r\nfocuses primarily on the well-being of the nation as a whole.\r\nThe failure, in many countries, of stringent adjustment\r\nprogrammes undoubtedly relates to a perspective which fails\r\nto recognize sufficiently the reality of developing countries\r\nat the present time and ignores the real aspirations of\r\nhumankind. In such a state of affairs, dialogue between\r\nNorth and South is difficult and strained. The North itself\r\nhas succeeded in developing a number of mechanisms to\r\nsolve differences, in which the consistent application of the\r\nprinciples of equality and mutual respect commands our\r\nattention. Such consistent use of these principles could also,\r\nperhaps, open the way to fruitful dialogue with the South.\r\nIn 1992 Suriname and the Kingdom of the Netherlands\r\nsigned a Framework Treaty. This Treaty, together with the\r\n1975 Treaty, provides a basic framework for substantial\r\nsupport from the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the\r\ndevelopmental aspirations of the Republic of Suriname. It\r\nis with pleasure that we can announce here that, within the\r\nframework of these treaties, positive cooperation was\r\nrealized last year, which contributed substantially to the\r\nsuccesses in consolidating the restored democracy in\r\nSuriname, strengthening the constitutional State and\r\nprotecting human rights, as well as in establishing and\r\nmaintaining peace after the end of the armed struggle in the\r\ninterior of the country.\r\nHowever, some questions have been raised as to the\r\nmotives for this cooperation in the light of the recent attitude\r\nof the Treaty partner regarding support for the recovery of\r\nour country’s economy.\r\nDespite many efforts on the part of the international\r\ncommunity, the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which could\r\nprovide the framework for a comprehensive and sound basis\r\nfor future trade relations, are still ongoing. The Government\r\nof Suriname looks forward to an early and balanced\r\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round with a view to promoting\r\nthe establishment of a just and equitable multilateral trading\r\nsystem.\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nRecession in the world economy, stringent budgetary\r\npolicies in donor countries, trade problems and domestic\r\nfactors in a number of countries have dampened the hope in\r\nmany developing countries for a steady flow of development\r\naid. Concurrently, new claims on external financial\r\nresources are being made, so that allocations for future aid\r\ncan further cloud the outlook for multilateral aid. The\r\ngeneral trend at present is a marked increase in contributions\r\nto peace-keeping operations and a clear decline in funds for\r\noperational activities.\r\nThe annual peace-keeping budget has increased\r\nfivefold, and is expected to be $3,673,000,000 for 1993,\r\nwhile voluntary contributions to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations Fund for\r\nPopulation Activities and the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund have declined by about 10 per cent. In one of his\r\nreports, the Secretary-General noted that very serious\r\nproblems caused by civil unrest and other sources of strife\r\naffect an increasing number of people who are often among\r\nthe most vulnerable groups of the population, placing\r\nparticularly difficult demands on United Nations operational\r\nactivities.\r\nFailure to address issues such as the alleviation of\r\npoverty, underdevelopment, unemployment, illiteracy and the\r\nthreat to the environment because of a lack of financial\r\nresources can cause social tensions. This, in turn, can\r\ngenerate social disintegration and, eventually, the\r\ndestabilization of the political system. Hence, an agenda that\r\ntends to reflect mainly international peace and security\r\nproblems is not constructive. More and more it is\r\nrecognized that favourable economic and social conditions\r\ncan help strengthen peace and security. Therefore, we\r\nfavour a programme based on a combination of political,\r\neconomic and social factors together with global security.\r\nThe social crisis of the 1990s may be considered a\r\nresult of, inter alia, world-wide growing poverty, particularly\r\nin the developing countries, unemployment and social\r\nupheavals. It is therefore gratifying to note that preparations\r\nare being made for a World Summit for Social Development\r\nin 1995. It is our hope that the core issues of the Summit\r\ndirected towards the strengthening of the process of overall\r\nsocial development will be addressed during the preparatory\r\nprocess and that agreement can be reached, in a spirit of\r\nconsensus, on matters of such vital human importance.\r\nAgenda 21, adopted during the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development in Rio de\r\nJaneiro, and the subsequent establishment of the Commission\r\non Sustainable Development, are important guides for the\r\ninternational community in achieving sustainable\r\ndevelopment. UNCED also underscored the need to provide\r\ndeveloping countries with adequate resources and to\r\nacknowledge the urgency of making technology, especially\r\nenvironmentally sound technology, available to that end.\r\nHowever, the progress achieved to date in obtaining new and\r\nadditional financial resources is disappointing. Hence, we\r\nwelcome the Commission’s decision to establish two\r\nworking groups to tackle the two issues.\r\nMy Government supports a timely and strict\r\nimplementation of the Agreement signed by President\r\nAristide and General Raoul Cedras, containing arrangements\r\nmade with a view to reaching a political solution to the\r\nHaitian crisis. The United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States are playing a major role in implementing\r\nthe Agreement reached at Governors Island in New York.\r\nWe are deeply distressed by the recent developments in\r\nHaiti, which could jeopardize the return of President\r\nAristide. We strongly appeal to the military leaders in Haiti\r\nto uphold their promises and to create the atmosphere of\r\ncalm required for the full application of the Agreement.\r\nMy delegation has always stated that the principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter and the relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions, particularly those of the Security Council,\r\nprovide the best concrete basis for the achievement of a\r\ncomprehensive, just and durable peace in the Middle East.\r\nWe are therefore moved that the State of Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) have finally started\r\na negotiating process which could create the conditions for\r\npeace. The Agreement that was mutually recognized and\r\nsigned is a courageous step in that direction. We\r\ncongratulate both Israel and the PLO on this historic deed\r\nand we appeal to the international community to use this\r\nmomentum to bring peace and prosperity to the whole\r\nregion.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the progress made so far by\r\nthe multilateral party negotiating process to a negotiated\r\nsettlement and national elections in South Africa. A political\r\nsettlement will lead to the end of apartheid and establish a\r\nnew, united, non-racial and democratic South Africa. The\r\ndestructive character of apartheid has caused so much harm\r\nto the people that it is only fair that in this new era, every\r\neffort must be made to overcome social and economic\r\ndisparities so that peace and stability can be established. We\r\ntherefore expect the international community to fully and\r\ngenerously support the new South African Government with\r\nassistance for the reconstruction and development of the\r\nnation.\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 21\r\nLike many others in the world, my country is troubled\r\nby the continuing horrifying events taking place in Angola\r\nand in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We cannot let the suffering\r\nand degradation continue. The bloodshed, hatred and\r\nhostilities must end now, for the people concerned have the\r\nright to live in peace.\r\nWorld-wide drug abuse and trafficking remain a matter\r\nof deep concern, not only in our region but in the world as\r\na whole. Despite measures and strategies geared towards\r\nthe elimination of drugs, it is sad to note that drugs can be\r\nobtained for illicit purposes virtually everywhere in the\r\nworld. This is, indeed, an unfortunate development, since it\r\nwas expected that after the Global Programme of Action was\r\nadopted, together with the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary\r\nOutline of Future Activities in Drug Abuse Control, the\r\nsituation would improve substantially. We thus support the\r\nview that efforts against drug abuse and trafficking must\r\ncontinue in a balanced and concerted manner.\r\nThe end of the East-West confrontation has resulted in\r\na slowdown of the arms race and reduced the threat of\r\narmed conflict. We regret to observe, however, that the\r\nspread of conventional arms continues to take on a\r\ndangerous magnitude, while at the same time armed\r\nconflicts are increasing, causing the tragic loss of numerous\r\ninnocent human lives. Ongoing conflicts have already\r\nresulted in more than 100 million refugees world wide, 30\r\nmillion displaced persons and hundreds of millions of\r\nunexploded mines. It is time to recognize that trade in\r\nconventional arms should be drastically curbed.\r\nIn the context of global security, the question of the\r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction continues\r\nto be an important one. My delegation is in favour of a\r\nuniversally applicable and internationally verifiable\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. Such a treaty would\r\nstrengthen international security and would represent a\r\nfurther step towards nuclear disarmament.\r\nThe set of principles contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General \"An Agenda for Peace\" provides a\r\ncomprehensive framework for the maintenance of interna-\r\ntional peace and security. My delegation follows with keen\r\ninterest the activities of the United Nations in the fields of\r\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and post-conflict\r\npeace-building. We are aware that at present some 70 areas\r\nof conflict or potential conflict exist throughout the world.\r\nIn this respect, we welcome the involvement of regional\r\norganizations that can render valuable assistance in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, including\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nAccording to the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nMember States have entrusted to the Security Council the\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. The balance of political and economic\r\npower in today’s world has drastically changed.\r\nConsequently, the premise that brought about the structure\r\nof the Security Council is no longer valid. The general\r\ndebate last year on the issue of equitable representation and\r\nan increase in membership of the Security Council, which\r\nled to the adoption of resolution 47/62, can, it is hoped,\r\ncontribute to a more equitable geographical representation\r\nin the Council and to enhancing the democratization process\r\nof the work of the Council by making its deliberations more\r\ntransparent.\r\nThe expectations in the developing world that the\r\npost-cold-war era would create new development\r\nperspectives have not yet materialized. However, the\r\nincreasing pauperization of large parts of the world demands\r\nthe taking of urgent and decisive action to offer those people\r\nprospects for change and improvement in their daily living\r\nconditions. To this end, our Organization will have to\r\nstrengthen its prominent role as a factor for development and\r\nwill have to make the appropriate mechanisms effectively\r\noperational.\r\nIt is important for all Member States to provide the\r\nUnited Nations with legitimate room for that purpose.\r\nSuriname will, to the extent possible, make its contribution.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
