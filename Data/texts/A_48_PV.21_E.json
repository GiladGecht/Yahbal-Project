"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n21st\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nThursday, 7 October 1993\r\nat 3 p.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.45 p.m.\r\nADDRESS BY CHIEF ERNEST SHONEKAN, HEAD\r\nOF STATE AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE\r\nARMED FORCES OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF\r\nNIGERIA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\r\nChief Ernest Shonekan, Head of State and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nArmed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His\r\nExcellency Chief Ernest Shonekan, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nChief Ernest SHONEKAN: It is a great honour and\r\nprivilege, Sir, for me to address this Assembly under your\r\npresidency. Your election is a tribute to you and to your\r\ngreat country, Guyana. It furthermore attests to the\r\ninternational community’s confidence in your ability to carry\r\nout the duties of President of the General Assembly during\r\nthe next 12 months. I have no doubt that, given your\r\nsterling qualities, you will guide this session to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nI also wish to commend your distinguished predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of the Republic of\r\nBulgaria, for the able and outstanding manner in which he\r\nconducted the affairs of the forty-seventh session.\r\nI would also like to express my delegation’s\r\nacknowledgement of the dedicated manner in which the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has been\r\ndirecting the work of our Organization during this crucial\r\nperiod.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria,\r\nI welcome all the new Member States, fully confident of the\r\nuseful contribution they can make in furtherance of the noble\r\nobjectives of the United Nations.\r\nThe relevance of our great Organization to the solution\r\nof the common problems facing humanity is more manifest\r\ntoday than at any time in our history. The complexity of\r\nthese pressing concerns and the need to act rapidly and with\r\nresolve demand a greater degree of concerted efforts by\r\nmembers of the international community. Events happening\r\naround us demonstrate the urgency of this imperative. In the\r\nlast few years, the international landscape has witnessed\r\nunprecedented transformations and rapid changes. The cold\r\nwar has become a thing of the past. Progress has been made\r\nin nuclear disarmament. The wave of democratization which\r\nhas been sweeping across the world has not diminished in\r\nintensity or breadth. The search for greater prosperity\r\nthrough emerging regional economic arrangements is\r\nspreading.\r\nIn spite of the inherent benefits of all these\r\ndevelopments, no sooner do we succeed in resolving one set\r\nof problems than we are confronted with new and more\r\nchallenging ones. Indeed, the promise of global peace and\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86794 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.21\r\n29 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsecurity and the vision of a new world order are inhibited by\r\npolitical and ethnic conflicts, economic and social disorder,\r\nand deepening poverty, particularly in developing countries.\r\nIn this connection, the consequences of feeble gestures\r\nor inaction are just too frightening to contemplate. It is\r\ntherefore necessary to draw attention to the major concerns\r\nso that they can be fully addressed with a view to finding\r\nlasting solutions which are just and beneficial to every\r\nmember of the international community.\r\nIn view of the positive changes in the international\r\npolitical environment, the United Nations has been placed at\r\nthe centre of conflict resolution, having been accorded its\r\nrightful place in the promotion and maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Unfortunately, our\r\nOrganization is being overwhelmed by the avalanche of\r\nconflicts which it is suddenly called upon to resolve.\r\nPractically all regions of the world are embroiled in one\r\nconflict or another. No region, however, is as afflicted as\r\nAfrica, either in the number of conflicts currently raging or\r\nin their unimaginable negative effects on people. In one\r\nconflict alone - that of Angola - as many as 1,000 people are\r\nreported to be dying each day. Angola is not alone in the\r\nunenviable situation created by civil conflict: Sudan,\r\nSomalia and Liberia can be cited.\r\nRegional conflicts constitute a key threat to the\r\nachievement of global peace and security. This is why we\r\nwelcome the active and increased involvement of the United\r\nNations in peace-keeping and peace-building efforts. The\r\nrole of our Organization in these areas will continue to\r\nexpand as more States call on it for assistance in preventing\r\nor containing conflicts. Member States have the duty to\r\nsupport fully the work of the Organization in this very\r\nimportant role. They must be prepared to provide the\r\nOrganization with the resources and the personnel it requires\r\nto cope with ever-growing peace-keeping demands. The\r\nprice of peace may be high; we must be conscious, however,\r\nthat it is a far better bargain compared with the price of war.\r\nIn this connection, the recent mammoth and multifaceted\r\npeace-keeping operation in Cambodia gives cause for great\r\noptimism.\r\nThe United Nations must direct its peace-keeping\r\noperations in a manner that does not jeopardize its integrity\r\nor expose its peace-keepers to avoidable danger.\r\nFurthermore, it must be made clear to those who commit\r\nacts of aggression against United Nations peace-keepers that\r\nthey will be adjudged guilty of crimes against the\r\ninternational community. The safety of United Nations\r\npeace-keepers is of utmost concern to countries which, like\r\nNigeria, participate in many operations within and outside\r\nAfrica.\r\nI recall that, while on peace-keeping duty in the former\r\nYugoslavia, Nigerian troops were subjected to attack\r\nresulting in casualties. The same is happening in Somalia,\r\nwhere Pakistani, Italian, Nigerian, American and Malaysian\r\npeace-keepers have been brutally killed. The national\r\ntrauma occasioned by the loss of lives in United Nations\r\npeace-keeping missions gives rise to anxieties and doubts.\r\nHowever, I wish to assure this body that Nigeria will\r\ncontinue to demonstrate its commitment to the United\r\nNations by continued participation in its peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nIt is in this same spirit of service that Nigeria is seeking\r\nelection to the Security Council this year. I hope that\r\nMember States will give their valuable support to Nigeria’s\r\ncandidature.\r\nIn Africa, we have also made great efforts to contain\r\nand resolve conflicts in our continent. Nigeria has been\r\ninvolved in many of these efforts to bring peace to embattled\r\nareas. At the bilateral level, we hosted peace conferences of\r\nthe parties to the conflict in the Sudan. We have, through\r\nthe Organization of African Unity, joined other African\r\nStates to monitor the cease-fire in Rwanda. In Liberia,\r\nNigeria has been the moving force in the regional effort to\r\nbring peace to that war-torn country through the Military\r\nObserver Group (ECOMOG) of the Economic Community\r\nof West African States.\r\nBecause of positive developments in Liberia, we have\r\nindicated our intention to withdraw our troops at the\r\nappropriate time. This decision was based on the successful\r\nconclusion and acceptance of the Cotonou Agreement. All\r\nthe parties to the conflict and the international community\r\naccept the Cotonou Agreement as the basis for durable peace\r\nin Liberia. If, as we hope, the accord is faithfully\r\nimplemented, a democratically elected Government will have\r\nbeen installed in Liberia within the time-frame envisaged for\r\nthe withdrawal of our troops. While we do not, therefore,\r\ncontemplate a premature withdrawal, through this forum I\r\ncall upon the international community to bear in mind that\r\nNigeria has expended and continues to expend a significant\r\namount in the peace-keeping operation in Liberia. Urgent\r\ninternational support to the ECOMOG effort has become\r\ncrucial. Nigeria therefore welcomes Security Council\r\nresolution 866 (1993) of 21 September 1993, which set up\r\nthe United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL)\r\nand called upon Member States to support the peace process\r\nin Liberia by contributing to the Trust Fund being\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 3\r\nestablished by the Secretary-General. Early implementation\r\nwill be absolutely necessary to sustain the process.\r\nA cheering development in our continent is taking place\r\nin South Africa, where a democratic Government is now\r\nwithin sight. The doyen of South African nationalists,\r\nNelson Mandela, confirmed the irreversibility of the march\r\ntowards an apartheid-free society in his statement in this\r\nHall two weeks ago. As evidence of his conviction, he\r\ncalled for the lifting of the remaining economic sanctions on\r\nSouth Africa. I wish, in the name of Nigeria, to congratulate\r\nSouth African leaders, black and white, who in the past two\r\nyears have shown great statesmanship in the negotiations that\r\nhave resulted in the establishment by law of the Transitional\r\nExecutive Council.\r\nSouth Africa has come a long way out of its apartheid-\r\ninduced isolation. The international community should assist\r\nthe South Africans in completing the process of full\r\nintegration into the international system. To this end, those\r\nresponsible for the mindless violence occurring daily should\r\nbe unreservedly condemned. All South Africans should\r\nrealize that the watchful eyes of the international community\r\ncontinue to be focused on their country.\r\nNigeria will take immediate steps to respond to\r\nNelson Mandela’s call for economic cooperation with South\r\nAfrica. We shall also commence such contacts with the\r\nTransitional Executive Council, when it is physically\r\nestablished, as will facilitate diplomatic interaction at the\r\nappropriate time.\r\nThe road to democracy and the nurturing of democratic\r\ninstitutions in Africa have not been smooth. Indeed, the\r\ndemocratic enterprise in Africa faces many problems.\r\nAfrica’s economic underdevelopment and high level of\r\nilliteracy constitute major impediments to our attainment of\r\ndemocracy in its modern concept.\r\nBut such has been our fascination with democracy as a\r\nvalue deeply rooted in our culture that we in Africa have\r\nwillingly decided to face up to the challenge of putting in\r\nplace an enduring system of democratic governance in our\r\nrespective countries. I can say confidently that this is an\r\nenterprise my country has taken seriously. Our programme\r\nof transition from military to civilian rule has not been\r\nwithout its difficult moments. However, we have not\r\nallowed them to deter us from our cherished goal. We are\r\ndetermined not to repeat the mistakes of our earlier attempts\r\nto evolve a system that would preserve the corporate unity\r\nof our country. It was, therefore, to ensure that the\r\ndemocratic process could be completed within the shortest\r\npossible period - indeed, by March 1994 - that the Interim\r\nNational Government, which I have the honour and privilege\r\nto lead, was seen as the most viable option to ease the\r\nmilitary out of power without bloodshed.\r\nWe in Nigeria fully understand and appreciate the\r\ninterest and concern shown by the international community\r\nregarding recent political events in our country. After all,\r\ndemocratization has become a major component of the\r\nemerging new world order. We therefore appeal for the\r\nunderstanding of the international community in this difficult\r\nperiod in our nation’s history. I can assure this Assembly\r\nthat we are working very hard to find a just and generally\r\nacceptable solution to our problem. In this connection, I am\r\nhappy to state that only yesterday I inaugurated a\r\nhigh-powered Commission of Eminent Persons to look into\r\nthe circumstances leading to the annulment of the 12 June\r\npresidential election and submit a report within 60 days.\r\nNigeria has always respected the purposes and\r\nprinciples contained in the United Nations Charter and the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Aware that the\r\nhuman person is the central subject and main beneficiary of\r\nhuman rights, we fully believe that every citizen should\r\nparticipate actively, within legal limits, in the realization of\r\nthese rights. We welcome the Vienna Declaration on human\r\nrights and will, therefore, continue to be committed to the\r\nfreedom of all citizens and institutions that are engaged in\r\nhuman-rights activities.\r\nOne of the sad consequences of human-rights violations\r\nis the incidence of refugees and displaced persons - people\r\nfleeing from insecurity to safe havens, either within or\r\noutside their national territories. Today, several countries,\r\nincluding Nigeria, cater for the needs of millions of refugees.\r\nWe urge the countries of origin of these people to create an\r\nenvironment conducive to their return. This would help to\r\nreduce the severity of the impact of refugee flows on host\r\nnations, particularly in Africa, which are themselves faced\r\nwith excruciating economic difficulties.\r\nNigeria notes with great satisfaction that the situation in\r\nthe Middle East has taken a definite turn for the better. The\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nhistoric signing of the peace agreement by Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is a welcome and\r\nimportant landmark. We are convinced that this will lay the\r\nfoundation for peace between Israel and the Palestinians and\r\nwill constitute an indispensable element for the peaceful\r\nresolution of the entire Middle East problem. We again\r\ncongratulate the Government of Israel and the leadership of\r\nthe PLO, whose spirit of conciliation made the agreement a\r\nreality. We also commend the Governments of Norway, the\r\nUnited States of America and the Russian Federation for\r\ntheir efforts and their encouragement and support, which\r\nmade the peace agreement possible.\r\nThe debt crisis remains the most serious obstacle to our\r\neconomic development. The various attempts of creditor\r\ncountries to address this problem have been limited in scope\r\nand have failed adequately to deal with the debt problem of\r\nmiddle-income countries. Therefore, while noting with\r\nappreciation the relief provided under the Trinidad, Toronto\r\nand Houston terms, we must emphasize that the fundamental\r\ncrisis in the economic development of developing countries\r\nhas not been effectively addressed. The fact that the debt of\r\nAfrican countries in 1992 amounted to $275 billion - about\r\n73 per cent of the total output of the African continent -\r\ndemonstrates clearly the seriousness of the situation.\r\nMoreover, when it is borne in mind that debt-servicing\r\nobligations are estimated at about 30 per cent of the value of\r\nour exports, the crippling effect on our economies becomes\r\napparent. We therefore propose a dialogue involving all the\r\nparties to enable the issues to be properly addressed.\r\nThe various dimensions of Africa’s economic problems\r\nare worth repeating, as we who are at the receiving end of\r\nthe economic dislocation of varying degrees that affects most\r\nAfrican countries realize the necessity of continuing to draw\r\nour economic plight to the attention of the rest of the world.\r\nThis matter must not be regarded lightly. The African\r\neconomic crisis, as well as being a major source of the\r\nprevailing social and political turmoil in many countries of\r\nthe region, must be seen as a serious threat to the longer-\r\nterm prospects for the global economy.\r\nLet me be so bold as to say that the persistence of the\r\ncrisis is not due to inaction on the part of the African\r\nGovernments concerned. On the contrary - taking the\r\nexample of my country - the truth is that our determination\r\nto face up to the challenge of development is obvious from\r\nthe policy reforms we have been implementing for nearly\r\nseven years in order to restructure and revitalize the\r\neconomy. These reforms are already yielding some positive\r\nresults, but not of the magnitude that we regard as necessary\r\nif there is to be a significant upturn in the economy.\r\nIt would not be far-fetched to suggest that the fact that\r\nthe economic reforms that have been put in place have\r\nenjoyed only limited success is apparently due to lack of\r\nadequate support from the international community to\r\ncomplement our genuine efforts to revamp our respective\r\neconomies. For instance, the flow of external finance to\r\nAfrican countries still leaves much to be desired, despite the\r\nefforts made in recent years by countries like mine to ensure\r\na climate conducive to foreign investment. We therefore\r\nurge a change of heart on the part of our development\r\npartners, as this will be mutually beneficial. We also call on\r\nthe United Nations system to mobilize its machinery fully so\r\nthat lingering African economic problems may be addressed\r\neffectively.\r\nToday, Africa faces daunting environmental problems\r\ntoo. Desertification, drought, soil and marine erosion and\r\nshortage of fresh water are new difficulties confronting the\r\ncontinent. Two fifths of Africa’s land mass has turned into\r\ndesert. African countries continue to make efforts to arrest\r\nthis threat to our livelihood. However, we do not have\r\nsufficient resources to combat the scourge. We therefore\r\nurge the speedy conclusion of an international convention,\r\ncomplete with a funding mechanism, to combat drought and\r\ndesertification.\r\nIn the aftermath of the cold war, appreciable progress\r\nhas been made in the field of disarmament. It is comforting\r\nto note that, to a greater extent than during any other period\r\nin recent history, significant efforts have been made by\r\nStates to achieve openness and transparency with regard to\r\nsecurity issues. The unilateral decision of the nuclear-\r\nweapon States to halt nuclear testing was universally\r\napplauded. Needless to say, therefore, we were disappointed\r\nat the breach of the moratorium that occurred a few days\r\nago. We appeal once again to all nuclear-weapon States to\r\nrefrain from resuming nuclear testing and, thereby, enhance\r\nthe prospects for the non-proliferation Treaty review and\r\nextension Conference in 1995, which will be crucial to\r\nefforts to halt nuclear proliferation.\r\nSince the creation of the United Nations 48 years ago,\r\nthe world in which the Organization exists has undergone\r\nmany changes. These changes are reflected in its\r\nmembership, which, since 1945, has almost quadrupled. The\r\ndistribution of power and influence in the world has\r\nchanged. The institutions of the United Nations cannot and\r\nshould not be immune to the changes. Indeed, in order to\r\nmaintain its relevance, the United Nations must reflect the\r\nchanges in its environment. We renew our call for a serious\r\nreview of some of the institutions of the Organization -\r\nparticularly the Security Council. We have always stressed\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 5\r\nthe need to expand the membership of the Council by the\r\nadmission of additional permanent members so that all\r\nregions of the world would be represented. It is our hope\r\nthat negotiations on this crucial issue will be advanced\r\nduring this session of the General Assembly.\r\nNotwithstanding the several positive developments of\r\nthe past few years, the world still faces many challenges. In\r\naddition to the continued disruption of the peace and stability\r\nof many States by raging internal conflicts, there are\r\nproblems that require urgent action. The spread of poverty\r\nand the increasing imbalance between the developing and the\r\ndeveloped countries are two of the more spectacular of these\r\nproblems. We are convinced that correction of this\r\nunacceptable situation is an attainable objective.\r\nHowever, the solution requires a commitment by all\r\nStates to accept and vigorously practise the concept of\r\ninternational cooperation. My country remains an active\r\npartner in this cooperative endeavour to make our world\r\nsafer and more prosperous.\r\nAs we look forward to the celebration, in two years’\r\ntime, of the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United\r\nNations, there is in the air much optimism about the future\r\nof the Organization. The new world order, if it is to fulfil\r\nits promise, must be constructed on the solid foundation of\r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Thus,\r\nour Organization is bound to play a central role in sustaining\r\na world of the sovereign equality of States; a world of\r\nrespect for fundamental human rights; a world of global\r\ninterdependence and of cooperation for development.\r\nLet all Member States demonstrate the determination to\r\nensure that our world body justifies the expectations of\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of State and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria for the statement he has just made.\r\nChief Ernest Shonekan, Head of State and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nPROGRAMME OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Before calling on the next speaker,\r\nI should like to inform members that tomorrow morning the\r\nplenary meeting of the General Assembly will start at 9.30\r\ninstead of 10.\r\nThe Assembly will consider, before continuing the\r\ngeneral debate, the third report of the General Committee.\r\nIt will also take up agenda item 38, \"Elimination of\r\napartheid and establishment of a united, democratic and non-\r\nracial South Africa\".\r\nUnder this item, the Assembly will consider a draft\r\nresolution on the lifting of sanctions against South Africa,\r\nwhich was issued today as document A/48/L.2.\r\nIt is my understanding that broad-based consultations\r\nwithin and among regional groups have taken place and that\r\nas a consequence draft resolution A/48/L.2 is a consensus\r\ntext. It has furthermore been agreed that there be no debate\r\non agenda item 38 at this stage and that the only speaker\r\nwill be the representative of Nigeria to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.2.\r\nMay I point out that the question of apartheid will be\r\ndiscussed in plenary meeting at a later date during the\r\nsession.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. RWEGASIRA (United Republic of Tanzania): I\r\nam delighted to extend to you, Sir, on behalf of the\r\nTanzanian delegation, our sincere congratulations on your\r\nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. Over the past two\r\nweeks you have already demonstrated your considerable\r\ndiplomatic skills and leadership qualities. We look forward\r\nto a productive session under your guidance.\r\nI would also like to extend my delegation’s appreciation\r\nto your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for\r\nthe leadership he provided to the forty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Secretary-General and the staff he leads have\r\ncontinued to give of their best to our Organization. Over the\r\npast year they have demonstrated a remarkable capacity to\r\ntake on additional responsibilities despite dwindling\r\nresources. We owe them a debt of gratitude and they have\r\na right to expect our support as they carry out the work we\r\nhave entrusted to them.\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nDuring the past year, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,\r\nMonaco, Eritrea, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia and Andorra have joined the United Nations as\r\nsovereign and independent States. It gives me great pleasure\r\nto extend to them a warm welcome and sincere\r\ncongratulations and to say how much we look forward to\r\nworking closely with all of them in the common endeavour\r\nto make our world a better place for our peoples and for all\r\nmankind.\r\nAnother year has passed since we last met in the\r\ngeneral debate and pledged to intensify our efforts to satisfy\r\nthe aspirations of our peoples for world peace and security,\r\nfor economic and social justice and for progress and\r\ndevelopment, in conditions of freedom and human dignity.\r\nIt is proper that as we start another session, we should take\r\nstock of the progress made towards the realization of these\r\naspirations.\r\nThe problems of southern Africa remained a major\r\npreoccupation of my Government during the past year. My\r\ndelegation commends the international community for its\r\ncontribution in the search for solutions to the problems of\r\napartheid in South Africa and the conflicts in Angola and\r\nMozambique.\r\nOver the last 12 months, the advance towards the\r\neradication of apartheid has brought the goal nearer than\r\never before. The call by the representatives of the majority\r\npeople of South Africa, notably by President Nelson\r\nMandela of the African National Congress of Azania (ANC),\r\nfor the lifting of virtually all remaining economic and trade\r\nsanctions means that the progress made thus far, and the\r\nprogress soon to be made, represent profound and\r\nirreversible change in terms of the Declaration on Apartheid\r\nand its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa.\r\nWhatever happens, South Africa will never be the same.\r\nA very important recent signal suggesting that the\r\nturning-point is very close was the fixing of 27 April 1994\r\nas election day for all South Africans. My delegation\r\nwarmly welcomes this development and urges all concerned\r\nto work to achieve that target. The most important\r\ndevelopment, however, has been the enactment last month of\r\nthe legislation necessary for the establishment of an\r\nindependent electoral commission, an independent media\r\ncouncil and an independent broadcasting authority as well as\r\na Transitional Executive Council.\r\nRegrettably, there remain many obstacles on the road.\r\nViolence remains the most serious obstacle impeding\r\nprogress towards the establishment of a united, democratic\r\nand non-racial South Africa. With 20,000 murders per year,\r\naccording to records compiled by the Southern African\r\nResearch and Documentation Centre, South Africa’s\r\nreputation of being the most violent country in the world is\r\nwell deserved. The leadership of the democratic forces in\r\nthe country must be commended for denying the forces of\r\ndeath and destruction the satisfaction of derailing the peace\r\nprocess. But the threat remains real and great, as evidenced\r\nby the brutal assassination of Chris Hani in April and the\r\nstorming by a right-wing racist white group of the\r\nnegotiations at the World Trade Centre in June.\r\nInternational monitoring of the violence has provided\r\nsome reassurance to the victims of apartheid violence. The\r\ntemerity and audacity shown by the perpetrators of violence\r\nand the blind eye turned to it by some members, including\r\nleaders, of the country’s security forces, argue for a much\r\nlarger, higher-profile United Nations presence in South\r\nAfrica. I urge the United Nations to respond positively to\r\nthe urgent pleas of the victims of violence for more United\r\nNations monitors.\r\nAnother obstacle is the non-participation by some\r\ngroups in the peace process and the threat of violence issued\r\nby some of them. This is yet another argument for\r\nincreasing the presence and raising the profile of the United\r\nNations, and of the world community as a whole, in South\r\nAfrica.\r\nAngola poses a similar but more urgent challenge to the\r\nUnited Nations. If it has a conscience, the international\r\ncommunity simply cannot allow the continuation of a\r\nconflict that is estimated to be claiming a thousand lives a\r\nday. It must act to stop this carnage.\r\nAt the same time, we must make every effort to enable\r\nthe United Nations to recover from the considerable damage\r\ndone to its credibility and moral authority by its inability to\r\nrespond adequately and promptly to the grave challenges\r\nposed by Jonas Savimbi. The adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 864 (1993) on 15 September 1993 has served to\r\nput Jonas Savimbi on notice that the United Nations will no\r\nlonger allow his obstinacy and prevarication to continue to\r\nthwart the will of the Angolan people, whose hopes for\r\npeace and an opportunity to improve their lives have been so\r\nrudely shaken by his greed for power. UNITA and Savimbi\r\nmust be left in no doubt that there is more to come if they\r\ncontinue to ignore the pleas of the international community\r\nfor a cease-fire, for a return to the Bicesse Accords and for\r\nrespect for the electoral verdict of the Angolan people.\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 7\r\nThis applies equally to UNITA’s obligation to allow\r\nand to facilitate access by humanitarian and relief\r\norganizations to the victims of the conflict. Many relief\r\npersonnel have exposed themselves to serious danger in\r\norder to help victims of the conflict. We commend them for\r\ntheir heroism and compassion. The best form of gratitude,\r\nhowever, is to ensure that those responsible for this criminal\r\nconduct receive appropriate punishment.\r\nAlthough different, Mozambique offers some parallels\r\nwith Angola, and it remains to be seen during the\r\nimplementation of the Mozambican peace accords whether\r\nthe correct lessons have been learned from the Angolan\r\nexperience. The delay in the implementation of the General\r\nPeace Agreement is a matter of great concern because of the\r\nobvious threat it poses to the cease-fire. We are pleased to\r\nnote that the Security Council has taken the same serious\r\nview of the delay. We are pleased also to note that at long\r\nlast the leader of RENAMO, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, has\r\nbeen able to overcome the difficulties which until recently\r\nprevented him from meeting with President Chissano. We\r\nwelcome the talks between the two leaders and commend\r\nPresident Chissano for bending over backwards to\r\naccommodate RENAMO. But we are concerned that the\r\ngood will and magnanimity of the Government of\r\nMozambique are not being reciprocated by RENAMO and\r\nits leadership. Instead, we observe disturbing signs of its\r\nfollowing in the footsteps of Savimbi.\r\nFor example, the Government is still not able to provide\r\nadministrative services in the areas under the control of\r\nRENAMO. The United Nations has a duty to prevent such\r\na blatant violation of the General Peace Agreement. But,\r\nmore ominously, RENAMO seems to be contriving to create\r\na situation in which it hopes to persuade the world to accept\r\nthe holding of elections before the process of demobilization\r\nand the integration of forces has begun. We must spare no\r\nefforts to enable the United Nations to do all in its power to\r\nprevent an Angola-type situation from emerging in\r\nMozambique.\r\nRegrettably, as the year continued there were more\r\ndisappointments than successes. With the exception of\r\nAngola, perhaps the most disconcerting were the setbacks\r\nsuffered by the peace efforts in the former Yugoslavia - in\r\nparticular in Bosnia and Herzegovina - in Afghanistan and\r\nin Somalia, where the turn of events has led to a wholly\r\nunexpected and unwelcome confrontation between the United\r\nNations and one of the factions in the tragic fratricidal\r\nconflict plaguing that country.\r\nWe must do all we can to protect and preserve the\r\nintegrity and moral authority of the United Nations in\r\nSomalia. Those responsible for the killing of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping forces and for instigating attacks against them\r\nmust be left in no doubt about the dire consequences of their\r\ncriminal conduct. But it goes without saying that the United\r\nNations forces must themselves act with maximum restraint.\r\nBecause Somalia is such a new experience for the\r\nUnited Nations, the outcome of its operation there is of\r\ncrucial importance to the international community. The\r\nUnited Nations cannot afford to fail in its mission of\r\nhumanitarian assistance, peace-building and peace-keeping\r\nin Somalia. Nor can it afford serious mistakes. My\r\ndelegation therefore welcomes the ongoing debate on how\r\nbest to achieve the United Nations mission in Somalia. The\r\ncall for the United Nations to refocus its attention on the\r\noriginal mandate and to pay greater attention to the search\r\nfor a political solution, along the lines of the Addis Ababa\r\nAgreement, deserves most urgent attention.\r\nThe cease-fire in Liberia, while holding, will remain\r\nfragile while tensions remain high and the end of the crisis\r\nis not in sight. The countries of the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) must be commended for\r\nundertaking an extremely costly and dangerous peace-\r\nkeeping mission in Liberia on behalf of the international\r\ncommunity. They need more than the moral and political\r\nsupport of the world community. We therefore welcome the\r\nestablishment, by Security Council resolution 866 (1993) of\r\n22 September 1993, of the United Nations Observer Mission\r\nin Liberia (UNOMIL), which will work alongside the\r\nprecedent-setting African peace-keeping effort under the\r\nauspices of ECOWAS to help resolve the Liberian conflict.\r\nThe people of Western Sahara are understandably\r\nfrustrated that, five years after the adoption of the United\r\nNations plan for a referendum in Western Sahara, the\r\ninternational community has still not been able to give\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthem an opportunity to exercise their right to\r\nself-determination. It is not good enough to tell them that\r\nevery effort is being made to overcome the problems which\r\nhave prevented the holding of the referendum. After five\r\nyears of discussion of the modalities of implementation, they\r\nhave a right to ask whether all the parties have been\r\nnegotiating in good faith.\r\nAnother African conflict-resolution initiative which\r\ndeserves urgent United Nations support is the Peace\r\nAgreement between the Government of Rwanda and the\r\nRwandese Patriotic Front (RPF), which was signed in\r\nArusha, Tanzania, on 4 August 1993 after a year of arduous\r\nand protracted negotiations. As Facilitator in the\r\nnegotiations, Tanzania pays tribute to the parties to the\r\nnegotiations for their spirit of give and take, which enabled\r\nthe negotiations to succeed. We pay tribute to the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) for its invaluable role\r\nthroughout the peace process. We also pay tribute to the\r\nobserver countries - Belgium, Burundi, France, Germany,\r\nSenegal, Uganda, the United States and Zaire - and to the\r\nUnited Nations for their encouragement and support. Nor\r\nshould we forget the invaluable contribution of Mali,\r\nNigeria, Tunisia and Zimbabwe, which provided personnel\r\nfor the Neutral Military Observer Group (NMOG II), which\r\nhas been monitoring the cease-fire.\r\nAs implementation of the Agreement begins, priority\r\nmust now be given to the establishment of the neutral\r\ninternational force. The joint delegation of the Government\r\nof Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front currently\r\nvisiting the United Nations has been stressing that everything\r\nelse hinges on the establishment of that force. I echo their\r\nappeal for speed in establishing the force. My delegation\r\ntherefore welcomes the timely adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 872 (1993) on 5 October 1993, authorizing the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations Assistance Mission for\r\nRwanda (UNAMIR), and urges its speedy implementation.\r\nComparisons are inadequate for measuring the suffering\r\nor damage endured by people in a war, but it is difficult to\r\nthink of another current conflict in which a whole people has\r\nbeen subjected to the suffering, inhumanity and indignities\r\nthat have been imposed on the Muslim population of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina. The inability of the United Nations to\r\noffer any hope to the Bosnian Muslims is one of the greatest\r\ntragedies of our time. It is bad enough that the international\r\ncommunity has failed to put an end to the atrocities which\r\ncontinue to be inflicted on the Bosnian Muslims. But for the\r\nworld\r\ncommunity in these circumstances to continue to deny them\r\nthe right to acquire the means with which to protect\r\nthemselves is incomprehensible. The least that the United\r\nNations can do is to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina in order to enable the people to defend their\r\nfamilies and their country.\r\nAt long last there are signs of an emerging solution to\r\nthe long-festering sore of the root cause of the Middle East\r\nproblem - the question of Palestine - the persistence of\r\nwhich has for 40 years posed a serious moral dilemma for\r\nthe international community’s sense of justice, fairness and\r\nequality. The agreement signed in Washington on\r\n13 September 1993 between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) on mutual recognition, which\r\nalso provides for limited autonomy for Palestinians in the\r\nGaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, has been\r\nrightly hailed as a major breakthrough in the Middle East\r\nnegotiations. My delegation joins in welcoming this\r\ndevelopment and in congratulating Israel and the PLO on the\r\ncourage they have shown in taking this bold step towards the\r\nresolution of the intractable question of Palestine. The first\r\nstep is always the most difficult to take. We are, therefore,\r\nhopeful that Israel and the PLO will now be able to move\r\nquickly to advance the process towards a just and lasting\r\nsolution to the question of Palestine and thus open the way\r\ntowards a comprehensive settlement of the Arab/Israel\r\nconflict.\r\nFor the people of Cyprus - another vexed question that\r\nhas defied solution for nearly 20 years - a meaningful new\r\nworld order must be one that respects the unity, sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity as well as the non-aligned status of\r\nthat country, and restores a sense of hope to the two\r\ncommunities for a future of partnership and cooperation in\r\ncomplete equality and human dignity. It is a matter of great\r\ndisappointment that the hopes raised by the resumption early\r\nin the year of negotiations under the good offices of the\r\nSecretary-General proved to be premature.\r\nIn Cambodia, the efforts of the United Nations to find\r\na just and enduring end to the long-running conflict have\r\nbegun to bear fruit. The successful organization and\r\nsupervision of the Cambodian elections concluded an\r\nimportant and crucial phase of the peace effort. However,\r\nthe people of Cambodia are not yet out of the woods. There\r\nis still a lot of healing of wounds to be done. We applaud\r\nthe efforts being exerted to enable those who walked out of\r\nthe peace process to rejoin it as the phase of reconciliation,\r\nreconstruction and development begins.\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 9\r\nThere is good news too with regard to the situation in\r\nCentral America. There, the situation has continued to\r\nevolve positively, thus rewarding the international\r\ncommunity in its efforts to encourage the region to find\r\nregional solutions to its problems.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the growing involvement of\r\nthe Security Council in the search for solutions to many\r\nconflicts around the world. But the Council’s capacity to\r\nrespond to the growing demands for its intervention and the\r\nreadiness of the international community to continue to\r\nrepose its trust and confidence in the Council will depend on\r\nits ability to institute the necessary reforms.\r\nOne such reform that has been called for is the\r\nexpansion of the Council to take account of today’s vastly\r\nchanged circumstances in comparison with 1965, when the\r\nCouncil was last expanded. I need not stress that any\r\nexpansion must take account of the need to ensure equity in\r\ngeographical representation. This also applies to the call for\r\nconsideration to be given to increasing the number of\r\npermanent members.\r\nAnother reform relates to the need to address the\r\nproblem of selectivity by the Council in responding to\r\nvarious conflicts. Unless the Council is seen to treat equally\r\nall challenges to its authority, it runs the risk of losing the\r\ninternational community’s support and trust, which are\r\ncrucial if the Council’s actions are to be accepted as\r\nlegitimate.\r\nIn addition, the old problem of the outdated veto is still\r\nwith us and failure to do something about it will not make\r\nit go away. The very encouraging practice of reaching\r\ndecisions by consensus has reduced the demand for the\r\nabolition of the veto. This has helped, but it is not enough.\r\nSo long as the veto exists, the threat of its use will continue\r\nto affect the outcome of debates. One member will always\r\nbe able to thwart the will of the international community.\r\nHow the Council does its work is also a matter of great\r\ninterest and concern to the international community. The\r\ncall for transparency is a very legitimate one, but of greater\r\nconcern is the growing conviction on the part of a large\r\nsegment of the membership of the United Nations that the\r\nCouncil has been stretching its interpretation of the Charter\r\nto include things not foreseen in Chapter VII, such as\r\nhumanitarian emergencies, human rights, ecological threats,\r\ndrug trafficking and the like. While the Council must be\r\nenabled to respond to new situations, there is a real danger\r\nthat it will allow itself to be guided not by the Charter but\r\nby the dictates of a few Member States.\r\nDisarmament has always been a major preoccupation of\r\nthe international community for reasons that are self-evident.\r\nThere are far too many weapons around the world - more\r\nthan nations need for their legitimate defence. The priority\r\ngiven to the chemical weapons Convention reflects the\r\ninternational community’s concern about the great danger\r\nposed to international peace and security by this particular\r\nweapon of mass destruction. Regrettably, nuclear arms,\r\nwhich pose an even greater threat, have not received the\r\npriority consideration they deserve. While we applaud the\r\nagreements concluded by the United States and the Russian\r\nFederation for sharp reductions in their nuclear arsenals, the\r\nfact should not be overlooked that, even after the START\r\nTreaty, there are today in their stockpiles five times more of\r\nthis category of nuclear weapons than existed at the time of\r\nthe signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons in 1968, and the level is the same as it was when\r\nthey began negotiations nine years before the START Treaty\r\nwas signed. The reality of the nuclear threat becomes more\r\nevident if we take account of the nuclear-weapon stocks of\r\nthe other nuclear-weapon States. That is why we must urge\r\nall nuclear-weapon States to accord the highest priority to\r\nnuclear disarmament.\r\nMy delegation has always regarded the non-proliferation\r\nTreaty, despite its flaws, and a comprehensive test-ban treaty\r\nas important international instruments that can advance the\r\ncause of nuclear disarmament. It goes without saying that\r\nbefore the non-proliferation Treaty can perform this role, its\r\ninherent flaws - especially its provisions discriminating\r\nbetween nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon States -\r\nmust be addressed. The two major nuclear-weapon States\r\nhave agreed on some reductions in their stockpiles. They\r\nneed to go much further and to make clear that the objective\r\nis the eventual elimination of those stockpiles, which means\r\nthat they must stop, reverse and eventually put an end to\r\nvertical proliferation. The 1995 Review Conference of the\r\nTreaty will be a success to the extent that it comes to grips\r\nwith these flaws.\r\nThe most hopeful recent development towards a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty has been the voluntary\r\nmoratorium or restraint on testing unilaterally agreed to by\r\nall the nuclear-weapon States. That is why we welcome the\r\ndecision of the United States of America to extend its\r\nmoratorium. We very much hope that this extension will\r\npersuade the other nuclear-weapon States to maintain their\r\nmoratoriums and that the halt can be used to negotiate a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty under the auspices of the\r\nConference on Disarmament or the Amendment Conference\r\nof the partial test-ban Treaty.\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe world economic statistics for the period 1992 to\r\n1993 send mixed signals. Overall, despite strong growth in\r\na number of developing countries, there was negligible\r\ngrowth in the world economy. For much of the African\r\ncontinent, per capita output has continued to decline, placing\r\nthe continent in a precarious situation. The average growth\r\nof gross domestic product in Africa reached a new low of\r\n1.4 per cent in 1992, owing in part to drought, civil wars,\r\npolitical instability and the long-term effects of deteriorating\r\nterms of trade as a result of the inequitable operation of the\r\npresent world order.\r\nThe United Nations agenda for the development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s, adopted by the General Assembly at its\r\nlast session, seems unlikely to fare any better than its\r\npredecessor, the United Nations Programme of Action for\r\nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development, 1986-1990.\r\nAs became obvious during the review of the Programme of\r\nAction carried out in 1990, that initiative fell short of the\r\ncontinent’s expectations. Nevertheless, Tanzania believes\r\nthat both the United Nations and the international community\r\nat large still have the ability to play a greater role in\r\nassisting the continent to overcome its poverty.\r\nRecovery of investments is crucial to the long-term\r\nimprovement of the economic performance of the African\r\ncontinent. However, contrary to earlier expectations,\r\neconomic reform has not brought a significant increase in\r\ninvestments. Throughout Africa, it remains far below its\r\npeak level of the mid-1970s as a result of foreign exchange\r\nconstraints arising from deteriorating terms of trade and\r\nlimited capacity to import capital goods, and because of the\r\ndebt burden and debt servicing.\r\nTanzania welcomes the initiative taken by some donor\r\ncountries to address the problem of the debt crisis by writing\r\noff part of the bilateral official debt of the least developed\r\ncountries. However, this is only part of the solution to the\r\nproblem. Apart from debt-relief measures, Africa needs a\r\nfresh infusion of financial resources to improve the rate of\r\ninvestment and to accelerate the economic growth of\r\naffected countries.\r\nIt is for this reason that Tanzania welcomes the\r\ninitiative of the Government of Japan to organize, in\r\ncollaboration with the United Nations and the Global\r\nCoalition for Africa, the Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development in October 1993, with a view to\r\nhighlighting the issue of African economic development as\r\none of the central themes on the international agenda for the\r\ntwenty-first century. My delegation hopes that the Tokyo\r\nConference will come up with concrete recommendations on\r\nmeasures designed to help the African continent overcome\r\nits problems once and for all, as well as to remind the\r\ninternational community of its commitment to Africa and the\r\nneed to help the continent face the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century from a position of strength.\r\nWe have been walking the road from Rio for more than\r\na year now. In Rio we made a strong commitment to\r\nprotect our planet by promoting sustainable development\r\nthrough a global partnership. Though a basic framework to\r\nmake the world’s environment healthier in the twenty-first\r\ncentury was laid out at Rio, we have not, so far, begun\r\nmaking those commitments a reality. The truth is, the Earth\r\nis environmentally poorer than it was a year ago.\r\nThe high-level Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment has been formed to monitor progress in the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 and other activities related to\r\nthe integration of environmental and developmental goals\r\nthrough the United Nations system. Allow me to express\r\nmy delegation’s hope that this Commission will be an\r\naction-oriented body which will effectively translate the\r\ncommitments made in Rio into a reality, and that it will not\r\nend up being financially strapped, as has often been the fate\r\nof other United Nations institutions.\r\nA milestone reached at Rio was the decision to prepare\r\nan international convention to combat desertification and\r\ndrought. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for\r\nthe elaboration of this convention has already held its first\r\nand second substantive sessions and it is hoped that,\r\nhopefully by this time next year, a convention to combat\r\ndesertification and drought will have been finalized. While\r\nwelcoming the progress made during the first two\r\nsubstantive sessions, Tanzania wishes to call for maximum\r\nsupport and cooperation from all countries to ensure the\r\nsuccess of the global convention, which has particular\r\nrelevance for Africa. The convention should be looked\r\nupon, not only as a mechanism to attract resources, but also\r\nas a global partnership in combating a global phenomenon\r\nthreatening the sustainable development of over 900 million\r\npeople worldwide.\r\nThere is no end to our expectations in fulfilment of the\r\nUnited Nations. As the largest world family, it has to take\r\ncare of all the members of the family, rich and poor, able\r\nand disabled. The world would be a better place for mankind\r\nif we in the United Nations act expeditiously, judiciously\r\nand fairly. After all, it is the people who constitute the\r\nStates that need help.\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 11\r\nMr. BASENDWAH (Yemen) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): It gives me pleasure to convey to you, Sir, on my\r\nown behalf and on behalf of the delegation of Yemen, my\r\nmost sincere congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I have no doubt that you deserve the trust that\r\nhas been placed in you by the Member States of this great\r\ninternational Organization. Your personal qualities, long\r\nexperience, sagacity and tact make you eminently qualified\r\nto conduct the deliberations of this session with excellence\r\nand effectiveness. Just as your election attests to your high\r\nstanding at the international level, it bespeaks the esteem in\r\nwhich your country is held by other countries the world\r\nover. We wish you every success in the important tasks\r\nassigned to you and trust this session will achieve its\r\nimportant goals so as to strengthen the functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations and its organs and enhance their\r\neffectiveness.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express our\r\nthanks and appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Ganev of\r\nBulgaria, for the important role he played in guiding the\r\nwork and deliberations of the forty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI cannot fail to extend my best wishes to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts\r\naimed at strengthening the work of our great Organization,\r\nupholding the principles and achieving the goals of its\r\nCharter. We should also like to express our appreciation for\r\nhis annual report (A/48/1) on the work of the United\r\nNations, in which he deals with the most important items on\r\nthe agenda of this session.\r\nWe should also like to avail ourselves of this\r\nopportunity to welcome those States that have recently\r\njoined the United Nations and wish them every success.\r\nTheir presence here among us attests to the international and\r\nuniversal nature of the Organization and contributes to the\r\nattainment of our common goals, in accordance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nThis is the fourth session in which the Republic of\r\nYemen is represented by one delegation, whereas in the past\r\nit was represented by two. On 22 May 1990, our country\r\nregained its unity after about two centuries of disunity in the\r\ncourse of which a power struggle raged between the\r\noccupiers of various parts of the country. This reached its\r\npeak on 30 November 1967, when Yemen was divided into\r\ntwo States.\r\nAlthough that miraculous unitary achievement of four\r\nyears ago seemed impossible, our people and its wise leaders\r\nwere able to bring it about, and other peoples that are still\r\ndivided may look upon our example with hope. Our people\r\nfought and made many sacrifices over many generations for\r\nthe attainment of that objective. The unity of our homeland\r\nhas been characterized by pluralism, multilateralism and\r\ndemocracy.\r\nFurthermore, on 27 April of this year the Republic of\r\nYemen crowned its march towards democracy with general\r\nparliamentary elections that were free, impartial and honest.\r\nRepresentatives of international organizations that defend\r\ndemocratic ideals participated by following those elections\r\nclosely and monitoring their proper procedure. Western and\r\nArab monitors welcomed that democratic exercise in Yemen,\r\nand The New York Times described the events in our country\r\nas \"a true Arab revolution\". In the light of all this, we\r\nbelieve we are justified in feeling a sense of pride as we\r\ntake part in this session against the backdrop of such\r\nachievement by a country that has worked two miracles\r\nwhich no one thought possible only four years ago.\r\nOur success in opting for democracy on the basis of\r\npluralism and the multiparty system clearly demonstrates that\r\nthe seeds of democracy can germinate in any soil once it is\r\nplanted and is not the preserve of any special soil. No one\r\nshould marvel, however, at the success of democracy in our\r\ncountry. Yemen, as historians know, was the first cradle of\r\nthe practice of \"Shura\", that is to say parliamentary activity,\r\nfrom as far back as the days of the Kingdom of Sabã 2,800\r\nyears ago. This is attested to in the Holy Koran and other\r\nearlier books of revelation.\r\nThree years have passed since the unfortunate invasion\r\nof Kuwait by Iraq and the second Gulf crisis that ensued.\r\nMy country continues to suffer the terrible consequences of\r\nthat crisis. One million of our expatriate countrymen had to\r\nreturn to Yemen as a result of that war, and yet we have not\r\nreceived any external assistance from any quarter whatever\r\nto lighten the burden of that return. The Republic of Yemen\r\nis and has always been against the use of armed force in\r\nresolving conflicts. We reject the idea of the acquisition of\r\nthe territories of others by force. That is why our position\r\non this situation remains unchanged. We consider that\r\nKuwait is a sovereign, independent State and not part of any\r\nother State. Since the Republic of Yemen is an Arab\r\ncountry that, geographically, is part of the Arabian\r\nPeninsula, we have been deeply chagrined by what happened\r\nbetween the two neighbouring, sister countries of Iraq and\r\nKuwait, and by the resultant deep cracks in the edifice of\r\nArab solidarity. For that reason, the Republic of Yemen has\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncontinued to urge the Iraqi leaders to carry out all that is\r\ncalled for in international resolutions. In that context the\r\nresponsiveness and readiness to cooperate demonstrated until\r\nnow by the Government of Iraq are cause for optimism and\r\nshould lead us to review the sanctions that are now in place.\r\nSimilarly, ensuring the territorial integrity and\r\nsafeguarding the sovereignty and independence of the\r\nRepublic of Kuwait are an absolute necessity. None the\r\nless, this can never be achieved in a lasting and definitive\r\nmanner unless the two countries reach a mutually acceptable\r\nformula of agreement and the Arab countries, in particular,\r\nas well as the international community as a whole, guarantee\r\nstrict adherence to such agreement so that neither of the two\r\ncountries may breach it. Such agreement should make it\r\npossible to reassure the State of Kuwait that the events of\r\n2 August 1990 will not recur and also make it possible to\r\nresolve all outstanding issues so as to prevent any future\r\ndispute.\r\nThere is no doubt that our Kuwaiti brethren are well\r\naware of the fact that the sovereignty, independence and\r\nsecurity of Kuwait cannot be guaranteed indefinitely by\r\ndependence on international protection alone but must have\r\nits solid basis in sound and equitable relations between their\r\ncountry and Iraq in the framework of a climate of security\r\nand fraternal reconciliation in the region.\r\nGiven Iraq’s readiness to cooperate in the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions, we believe\r\nthat the blockade against Iraq is no longer justified. Indeed,\r\nthe suffering of the Iraqi people has reached an intolerable\r\nlevel, and we do not believe that the international\r\ncommunity is prepared to accept the death of innocent\r\nwomen, children and old people because of lack of\r\nmedication. At the same time, my country reaffirms the\r\nneed to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq,\r\nand we ask that there be no further destruction of Iraq’s\r\neconomic, scientific and social infrastructures.\r\nFollowing the establishment of the Republic of Yemen,\r\nmy country declared that one of the goals of Yemeni unity\r\nis to contribute to the security and stability of our region and\r\nto promote cooperation and integration between all its\r\ncountries. In pursuance of that objective, relations between\r\nOman and Yemen have been strengthened and have become\r\na model to be followed. However, this sound beginning is\r\nbut a key, albeit an important key, to the doors which, when\r\nfully opened, will allow movement on the economic, security\r\nand trade tracks towards economic integration and security\r\ncooperation between all the region’s countries especially now\r\nthat between Yemen and Oman there are the initial steps\r\ntowards easy access for passengers and goods. There is no\r\ndoubt that Yemeni-Omani relations are of special\r\nsignificance to the future stability and prosperity of the\r\nregion. They represent a practical and important beginning\r\nto the much needed process of putting the Arab house in\r\norder both at the regional and the Arab levels. They are also\r\nrelations that pose no threat to the interests of others as they\r\nare open, transparent and well-defined as regards their ends\r\nand means.\r\nSimilarly, Yemen’s relations with other sister countries\r\nare based on historic kinship and religious links and on the\r\nfact that we all belong to one and the same Nation. That is\r\nthe reason why Yemen has always stood by its brethren in\r\nneighbouring countries and in the Arab world in general and\r\nhas always endeavoured to raise such relations to the level\r\nthat would enable it to perform its role vis-à-vis Arab and\r\ninternational issues.\r\nAs regards the border issues between Yemen and Saudi\r\nArabia, Yemen has been engaged since November 1972 in\r\ntalks with our brethren in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in\r\na climate of goodwill and with a genuine desire to turn a\r\nnew leaf. Following initial contacts last year in Geneva, a\r\njoint committee of experts was set up to negotiate the border\r\nproblem that lies at the forefront of the two countries’\r\nbilateral concerns. That committee has held five rounds of\r\nnegotiations, the most recent of which was held at T’az two\r\nmonths ago. In the meantime, other contacts have been\r\ntaking place between President Ali Abdullah Saleh and\r\nKing Fahd, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, through an\r\nexchange of letters, the last of which was the letter I\r\ndelivered to His Majesty King Fahd. Notwithstanding the\r\ncomplexities of the border problem between the two sister\r\ncountries, we continue to be optimistic as to the outcome of\r\nnegotiations, since both countries are desirous of seeing the\r\ntalks crowned with success and since good intentions exist\r\non both sides. This makes it easier and possible to resolve\r\nproblems. Everyone is well aware that factors tending to\r\nrapprochement between the two countries outweigh the\r\nfactors of discord. I can say that my last contact with\r\nKing Fahd, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, was\r\npositive and that I found him to be aware of the need for\r\nfraternity and cooperation between our two countries.\r\nThe deplorable situation in Somalia demands that, in\r\naddition to what the international forces are doing to\r\nestablish peace and security there and in addition to\r\ninternational support, further efforts should be deployed to\r\ninitiate national reconciliation between the various factions.\r\nWe urge the international community to redouble its efforts\r\nat the humanitarian level and we invite the factions in\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 13\r\nSomalia to rise to the level of their responsibilities and to\r\nwork on a basis conducive to reconciliation, to reject\r\nfactionalism and false sensitivities and to see that the\r\ncountry’s interests triumph over narrow, factional ones so\r\nthat it may be possible to rebuild what has been destroyed\r\nby that cruel war and pursue the path of development and\r\nprogress.\r\nAlthough Yemen previously had the honour of taking\r\npart in the efforts deployed to achieve national reconciliation\r\nthrough the Conference held in Djibouti two years ago, and\r\nalthough the national groups in Somalia have not committed\r\nthemselves to implementing the resolutions of that\r\nConference, we shall spare no effort in working for the\r\ndesired comprehensive national reconciliation in Somalia. It\r\nis only fair to commend here the role performed by our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and the\r\ninterest he takes in the Somalia tragedy. Let us pray that\r\nGod the all-powerful will guide the leaders of the various\r\nfactions in Somalia towards reconciliation so that peace may\r\nprevail over all parts of that sister country and enable it to\r\nwork towards reconstruction and development and to resume\r\nits place as an active member of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nAny observer who is familiar with the history of the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East region will be\r\ncertainly aware of the fact that the identity and destiny of\r\nPalestine have been at the core of the Arab-Israeli problem\r\nfrom the very outset, and the fuse that detonated the terrible\r\nexplosion of conflict from as far back as the British\r\nmandate. Since then, the Palestinian cause has continued to\r\nbe the focal point of the conflict, which has lasted for\r\ndecades and has led to three bloody wars; taken thousands\r\nof lives and caused millions to leave their homes; broken\r\napart thousands of families; destroyed property; and caused\r\nincalculable losses. Therefore, it is no wonder that the just\r\nsettlement of the question of Palestine is the key to resolving\r\nthe conflict and restoring peace.\r\nOur country’s prompt support for the agreement\r\nbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel in\r\nWashington on 13 September stemmed from our\r\ncommitment to the Rabat Arab Summit Conference\r\nresolution which recognized the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization as the sole legitimate representative of the\r\nPalestinian people as well as our respect for the right of\r\nevery people to choose its own course and exercise its own\r\nwill in full freedom. Having said all this, we view the\r\nagreement as an important first step towards a just, lasting\r\nand comprehensive peace in the region, as was stated by the\r\nCouncil of Ministers of the Arab Nations in Cairo last\r\nmonth. None the less, this step by itself and in itself will\r\nnot bring about peace unless it is followed by more\r\nsignificant steps at the levels of other Arab-Israeli\r\nnegotiating tracks. This will depend on Israel’s earnestness\r\nwith regard to withdrawal from all the Palestinian and Arab\r\nterritories it has continued to occupy since June 1967.\r\nIf we tell ourselves that Israel, at long last, has come to\r\nthe realization that it is unrealistic to hold on to the policy\r\nof depending on naked force due to the military superiority\r\nit enjoys, as a means of guaranteeing its continued existence,\r\nimposing its hegemony over the Arab people in Palestine\r\nand the neighbouring Arab States and imposing a peace that\r\nwould be tantamount to capitulation - I say that if we tell\r\nourselves anything of the sort, we shall be indulging in\r\nwishful thinking until such time as Israel demonstrates the\r\ntruthfulness of its declared intentions and passes the test by\r\nadopting sound positions in current and future negotiations\r\nwith the Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese and by\r\nwithdrawing from all the territories it now occupies. It must\r\nalso accept the establishment of the independent State of\r\nPalestine, which would include Gaza and the West Bank,\r\nwith Jerusalem as its capital, while the Republic of Yemen\r\nappreciates the important role played by the two co-sponsors\r\nof the Arab-Israeli negotiations and, in particular, the role of\r\nthe United States of America, it hopes that this role will be\r\nsuch as to prompt Israel to abandon the policy of force and\r\narrogance which it has pursued out of its feelings of military\r\nsuperiority, and because of the international support and\r\nprotection it has always enjoyed as well as the special\r\ntreatment extended to it by the Western Powers. It is time\r\nthe States of the world at large, and in particular the United\r\nStates, shouldered the responsibility of curbing Israeli\r\narrogance, especially after the crimes, killings, acts of\r\nintimidation and terrorization, the bombings, destruction and\r\natrocities it has perpetrated for decades in Palestine and\r\nother Arab countries. Those are acts that will shame\r\nmankind for a long time to come and that will torture the\r\nhuman conscience.\r\nWe do hope that the Gaza-Jericho agreement between\r\nthe PLO and Israel and the agenda between Jordan and\r\nIsrael will be accompanied by Israeli-Syrian agreements and\r\nIsraeli-Lebanese agreements in the near future. This should\r\nlead to the return of the Golan to Syria and to Israel’s\r\nwithdrawal from southern Lebanon. We also hope that such\r\nagreements will be followed by others that would lead to\r\nIsrael’s total withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories,\r\nincluding Al-Quds and all the other Arab territories that are\r\nstill under occupation. It is also our hope that the Israeli\r\nauthorities will finally desist from the arbitrary measures and\r\nacts of criminality against all our brethren in Palestine, in\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nLebanon and in the other occupied territories. If the battle\r\nfor peace has been joined, it shall not be won unless Israel\r\nshows a great deal of courage, abandons its arrogance and\r\nrealizes that this is the most difficult battle of all.\r\nThe end of the cold war and the emergence of the\r\nbeginnings of a new international order that is beginning to\r\ntake shape to rid the world of wars and conflicts require that\r\nlasting, total peace should prevail in the Middle Eastern\r\nregion on a fair and stable basis so that its peoples may\r\ntackle the task of development and improve their standards\r\nof living. This requires that all the States and peoples of the\r\nworld should take a firm stand in opposing any attempt to\r\ncreate obstacles in the path of peace, or to impose peace by\r\nforce. Our world will not enjoy peace until peace embraces\r\nevery part of the globe.\r\nLike many other countries, Yemen has followed with\r\ndeep concern the attacks against southern Lebanon and the\r\nBekaa Valley by Israel in the month of July, in full sight of\r\nthe international community. Yemen, while stressing the\r\nimportance of respecting Lebanon’s independence, territorial\r\nintegrity and sovereignty and safeguarding its right to live\r\nwithin recognized international borders, condemns Israel’s\r\ncontinued occupation of southern Lebanon, and demands\r\nunconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978).\r\nThe international community should take a firm stand in\r\norder to compel Israel to refrain from these acts of\r\naggression and to compensate the people of Lebanon for the\r\nenormous losses they have sustained.\r\nIt is inadmissible, illegal and immoral for peoples, on\r\nthe eve of the twenty-first century, to suffer from injustice\r\nand to be exposed to physical liquidation for ethnic or\r\nreligious reasons. The most horrendous example of this is\r\nthe case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United Nations,\r\nsince it was created, has never faced a more serious\r\nchallenge than the one that confronts it now in that peaceful\r\nEuropean Muslim country. It is very difficult indeed to\r\nunderstand the stance of the international community with\r\nregard to that situation. In practice, all the slogans have\r\nturned out to be no more than hot air. Developments in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina squarely put a heavy burden of guilt\r\non the shoulders of the international community and\r\nespecially the major Powers, with regard to the collective\r\nmassacring of Muslims at the hands of the Serb and Croat\r\nfascists. As long as we, as an international community,\r\ncontinue to fail to face up to such a situation, and to\r\nsafeguard the right to life of the unarmed people of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, how could we pretend to champion human\r\nrights on this planet? In the most restrained terms, we can\r\nonly say that the world’s stance vis-à-vis what is happening\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina will be a stigma, a brand of Cain\r\non the brow of the age and of the human race, for all\r\neternity.\r\nConsequently, this blatant defiance calls for practical\r\nmeasures by the international community to deter aggression,\r\nto intensify moral support and humanitarian assistance and\r\nto strengthen the steadfastness of the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina with a view to ending this tragedy. We in\r\nYemen join the other countries of the world in calling for an\r\nend to this aggression that Belgrade supports, and for a halt\r\nto the genocidal atrocities perpetrated by the Serb aggressors\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe support the request by the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nfor the venue of the negotiations to be moved from Geneva\r\nto United Nations Headquarters here in New York as those\r\nnegotiations are now at a critical juncture, and moving them\r\nto New York would strengthen the parties’ confidence,\r\nespecially that of the Bosnia and Herzegovina side, which is\r\nthe party that has to make the biggest sacrifice.\r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights held in\r\nVienna in June 1993 has studied the question of human\r\nrights, reviewed the fundamental precepts relating to those\r\nrights and underscored the need to implement them and to\r\nprovide humanitarian assistance to the victims of war and\r\nnatural disasters. Unfortunately, many of the tragic\r\nsituations which afflict people arise from certain crises and\r\npolitical conflicts that degenerate into armed confrontations.\r\nThe use of force and economic blockades that ensue result\r\nin untold suffering for innocent civilians, especially the most\r\nvulnerable, namely, women, children and the elderly, who\r\nare always the principal victims of such wars and blockades.\r\nThe situation in South Africa continues to be cause for\r\nconcern for most Member States of this Organization. The\r\nlatest news does not justify too much optimism. Over the\r\npast two months, there have been several massacres and\r\nkillings. That is why the most recent events should prompt\r\nus - and the United Nations - to monitor this situation\r\nclosely so that the goals contained in the 14 December 1989\r\nUnited Nations Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive\r\nConsequences in Southern Africa may be implemented.\r\nThe decision to deploy a peace-keeping force in South\r\nAfrica, a decision that has been welcomed by Inkatha, is a\r\nmajor step in leaving behind the cycle of violence, murder\r\nand massacre in the country, and may well make it possible\r\nto establish a democratic and non-racial regime. Here we\r\nshould like to emphasize the importance of having all the\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 15\r\nparties understand the need for peace, especially in view of\r\nthe forthcoming democratic, non-racial elections scheduled\r\nfor next year. We hope that the elections will be successful,\r\nand that they will mark a positive turning-point.\r\nJust a few days ago, we had the honour of hearing\r\nMr. Nelson Mandela address the Special Committee against\r\nApartheid, and we could feel his confidence in the future.\r\nWe hope that the dialogue that has now begun in South\r\nAfrica will make it possible to establish a democratic, non-\r\nracial regime.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his annual report on the\r\nactivities of the United Nations, declared that political\r\nprogress and economic development are inseparable. Yemen\r\nbelieves that, to revitalize economic growth in the\r\ndeveloping countries and enable those countries to continue\r\ntheir political and economic adjustment programmes, the\r\ndonor countries and the industrialized countries must provide\r\neconomic and technical support, and the United Nations\r\nmust continue to play its role in promoting cooperation\r\nbetween the developing and the industrialized countries in\r\norder to achieve the objective of economic integration on an\r\nequitable basis. It is also important to lighten the poor\r\ncountries’ debt burdens, to increase financial flows towards\r\nthem and to provide them with technical assistance in order\r\nto enable them to continue their programmes of adjustment\r\nand to achieve economic and social development.\r\nAs underscored by the meeting of the Ministerial\r\ncommittee for the economic development of the countries of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement held last May in Bali, Indonesia,\r\nthe economic situation in the developing countries has\r\nworsened. World economic growth is suffering from a\r\ngrave imbalance and the gap between the developing and the\r\ndeveloped countries has widened. The economic recession\r\nhas led to the growth of protectionism and declining\r\ndevelopment assistance. Furthermore, the increase in\r\nindebtedness and the burdens of debt servicing have resulted\r\nin capital outflows in the case of the developing countries.\r\nThis is a situation that threatens the very existence of those\r\ncountries and not only the prospects of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. We must refer in this respect to failure by the\r\nindustrialized countries to honour their commitments in line\r\nwith the agreements, strategies and international resolutions\r\nrelating to the inflows of development assistance to the\r\ndeveloping countries, especially those included in the\r\ninternational strategy for the eighties which called for the\r\nallocation by the industrialized countries of 0.7 per cent of\r\ntheir Gross National Product to development assistance.\r\nInstead of implementing those resolutions, the industrialized\r\ncountries have resisted every attempt to formulate and adopt\r\na new strategy for the 1990s. They have also failed to\r\nimplement the programme for the 1990s that had been\r\nagreed upon at the Paris Conference. This has been a real\r\nsetback for the economic and social development of the least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nWe do say that the principal responsibility for\r\ndevelopment lies with the developing countries themselves,\r\nbut national efforts alone are not enough: there must also be\r\na degree of international support and assistance. National\r\nefforts must be backed up by appropriate international\r\nefforts.\r\nWe feel that the international economic system must be\r\nfair and equitable towards the developing countries. This\r\ncannot be the so without political will, wisdom and courage.\r\nA great deal of work awaits the United Nations, and\r\nthis is why this session of the General Assembly is of\r\nspecial importance. The international community must avail\r\nitself of this opportunity to develop a concept of cooperation\r\nbetween countries, within the framework of the United\r\nNations, with a view to strengthening international peace and\r\nsecurity and economic stability the world over. This should\r\nalso help to strengthen the Organization, because the\r\nOrganization is the ideal framework for building that world\r\nof peace and stability on the basis of international legality.\r\nIn this connection, the United Nations must implement\r\nthe Charter without selectivity or double standards, for the\r\nCharter is the ideal framework for coordinating international\r\nefforts. As the international community must build a better\r\nworld within the framework of the United Nations to ensure\r\npeace and development, we, the family of nations, must have\r\nthe foresight and resolve to face up to the problems that\r\narise with the universal character of the United Nations in\r\nmind.\r\nMr. ROBERTSON (Jamaica): Mr. President, it gives\r\nme great pleasure to see you, a son of the Caribbean,\r\npresiding over the General Assembly at this forty-eight\r\nsession with the skill, competence and wealth of experience\r\nwe have come to associate with you. My delegation is\r\nconfident that under your leadership this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will complete its vitally important agenda.\r\nI also wish to express to your predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, our\r\nappreciation for the most able manner in which he presided\r\nover the forty-seventh session.\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMay I take this opportunity also to welcome\r\nformally to the United Nations the six countries - the Czech\r\nRepublic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Slovak Republic, The Former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Andorra - which\r\njoined the Organization this year.\r\nToday the global community is at a crossroads in\r\nhistory, poised between the prospect of peaceful economic\r\nprogress through globalization and technological\r\nadvancement and a relapse into conflict fuelled by poverty,\r\npolitical tyranny and ethnic strife. This situation has\r\nemerged with the end of the cold war, which has ushered in\r\nideological détente, and where the threat of nuclear conflict\r\nbetween super-Powers has receded. This is not, however, a\r\ncause for complacency, because unsupervised economic\r\nglobalization coupled with an escalation of political\r\nfragmentation could ignite fierce conflict between economic\r\nblocs and social groups world wide. The present dilemma\r\nis how we can capitalize collectively on the advantage\r\noffered by economic globalization, while avoiding political\r\nfragmentation owing to the resurgence of religious and\r\nethnic intolerance and chauvinistic nationalism.\r\nGlobalization, if not complemented by a comprehensive\r\nglobal economic framework, could lead to wider disparities\r\nbetween developed and developing countries, leaving a\r\ngrowing portion of the world’s population mired in poverty\r\nas entire productive sectors and economic activities are\r\nmarginalized from the dynamic of economic growth in the\r\nworld economy. The United Nations is the only forum that\r\ncan forge a global institutional consensus, a multilateral\r\nregulatory regime, and commonly subscribe to goals and\r\nunderstandings that will reduce the tendency to economic\r\ninequities. A shared economic development consensus could\r\nprovide the basis for more equitable participation for the less\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nWhether mankind succeeds in seizing the present\r\nopportunity for peace and economic progress depends\r\ncrucially on the United Nations as a mechanism for a new\r\nglobal dialogue based on genuine partnership between States\r\nwith widely differing philosophies, policies and practices.\r\nThe United Nations, with severe constraints of financial and\r\nhuman resources, has in the past year courageously\r\nattempted to meet these challenges, understandably with\r\nmixed results.\r\nWe therefore wish to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General and his dedicated staff of professionals\r\nwho have played a critical role in the search for resolution\r\nof bitter conflicts in every region - conflicts which have\r\ninflicted massive human suffering and devastation of the\r\nland.\r\nIn Cambodia, elections have taken place and a new\r\nGovernment has been installed. That achievement in\r\nCambodia will, we hope, mark the beginning of a new era\r\nof peace and stability in South-East Asia.\r\nOn the African continent, we welcome the signing of\r\nthe Cotonou Peace Agreement on 25 July, and we urge that\r\nall the parties to the conflict in Liberia remain committed to\r\nthis Agreement and work with the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nto bring lasting peace to that country. Unfortunately, the\r\nsituation in Somalia continues to be tragic and dangerous.\r\nWe hope that, through the efforts of the United Nations\r\nOperation in Somalia (UNOSOM) and others, there will be\r\na speedy return of peace to this land fractured and\r\ndevastated by civil strife. Jamaica regrets the continuing\r\nloss of life of members of the UNOSOM forces.\r\nDevelopments in South Africa are moving in a positive\r\ndirection. We welcome the decision to hold, on\r\n27 April 1994, elections open to all parties which will mark\r\nthe transition of South Africa to a democratic and non-racial\r\nsociety, and we eagerly anticipate the establishment of the\r\nTransitional Executive Council. The call by Mr. Mandela\r\nfor the removal of sanctions is a welcome one. Jamaica has\r\nparticipated in building consensus for the United Nations\r\nresolution to lift sanctions, and it intends to lift them\r\nimmediately upon the adoption of the resolution.\r\nThe situation in the States of the former Yugoslavia is\r\nalso an agonizing chronicle of tragic strife, suffering and\r\nabuses. We continue to hope for a just settlement on the\r\nbasis of Security Council resolution 859 (1993), which\r\naffirms the fundamental principles on which such a\r\nsettlement should be based.\r\nJamaica too hails the signing of the peace accord\r\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on\r\n13 September 1993, while fully recognizing that the progress\r\nachieved, despite its significance, is but an initial step.\r\nIndeed, there are complex matters that will face negotiators\r\nin the months and years ahead.\r\nNearer to home, in the Caribbean, the Government of\r\nJamaica and its partners in the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) have placed the resolution of the Haitian crisis\r\nhigh among their priorities. CARICOM has been actively\r\ninvolved at the United Nations in the effort to bring the issue\r\nof Haiti before the Security Council, and I express my\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 17\r\nGovernment’s appreciation to the member States of the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean Group for their support in this\r\nprocess.\r\nWe also commend the Special Envoy of the\r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States, Mr. Dante Caputo, for his\r\nuntiring commitment to this issue. However, in the light of\r\nthe grim evidence that dangerous elements are at work in\r\nHaiti, clearly determined to deny the Haitian people security,\r\ndemocracy and development, the international community\r\ncannot relax its vigilance. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide\r\nis scheduled to return to Haiti on 30 October. His return\r\nwill mark the beginning of a long and difficult period of\r\nreconstruction. He will need the full support and\r\ncommitment of our Organization, as well as of the entire\r\ninternational community. There is urgency in the call for\r\neconomic and technical assistance. Indeed, the Government\r\nof Jamaica has already offered, within our means, to provide\r\nHaiti with some technical assistance.\r\nThis new era following the cold war presents mankind\r\nwith new opportunities for a more rational and equitable\r\nmanagement of problems at the global level. I refer, in\r\nparticular, to the struggle against poverty and ethnic strife,\r\nhuman-rights violations and environmental degradation. The\r\nend of cold-war confrontations - political as well as military\r\nand ideological - should not be replaced by economic\r\nconflict. We must grasp the opportunity for constructive\r\naction and now work towards an era of cooperation that is\r\nnot distorted by ideological and political tensions.\r\nThe Security Council Summit meeting on\r\n31 January 1992 concluded with a statement in which it was\r\nsaid that its members recognized\r\n\"that peace and prosperity are indivisible and that\r\nlasting peace and stability require effective international\r\ncooperation for the eradication of poverty and the\r\npromotion of a better life for all in larger freedom\".\r\n(S/23500, p. 5)\r\nWe strongly support that view.\r\nFor many developing countries, including my own,\r\nmarket-oriented reforms have been a high priority. We have\r\nmade fundamental changes in economic policy, including\r\nmonetary and fiscal austerity, trade liberalization, divestment\r\nof public enterprises to the private sector, liberalization of\r\nforeign-exchange markets and general deregulation of\r\neconomies. In short, we have undertaken a thoroughgoing\r\nprocess of structural adjustment, which has created a private-\r\nsector-led, market-driven economy.\r\nFor countries that are undertaking economic structural\r\nadjustment the social consequences are high indeed. Tight\r\nmonetary and fiscal management reduces the capacity to\r\nprovide basic social services, such as health, education and\r\nhousing. Yet, if human needs are not adequately met, if\r\nhuman resources are not developed, we destroy the very\r\nbasis of sustained development: our people. Migration -\r\nnational and international - is one of the clearest\r\nmanifestations of social ills. If people do not find economic\r\nsecurity in their native land, they go wherever they can find\r\nit - from rural to urban area; from one country or one\r\ncontinent to another. So today there are some 35 million\r\ndisplaced persons. And such people are to be found in every\r\nregion.\r\nThe processes of structural adjustment are rendered\r\nextremely difficult in the absence of sustained international\r\nsupport - either directly, through the sustained infusion of\r\nexternal resources by way of development assistance and\r\ndebt relief, or indirectly, through reduced protectionism in\r\nindustrialized countries. Let me give an example related to\r\ndebt. Although my Government has managed to reduce the\r\nstock of external debt, debt servicing remains the most\r\ndebilitating constraint on the country’s economic\r\ndevelopment. The fact that international financial\r\ninstitutions, to which much of Jamaica’s debt is owed, refuse\r\nto consider the rescheduling of loans continues to be a major\r\nconcern of my Government. The consequence of this policy\r\nis that even those resources generated by developing\r\ncountries themselves are not available for the pursuit of\r\nnational development objectives, as they are pre-empted by\r\ndebt-servicing.\r\nI should like to refer to trade liberalization and trade\r\narrangements, especially with regard to countries undergoing\r\nstructural adjustment. In my own region, the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) has put in place mechanisms to\r\nenhance regional trade. At the same time, however, the\r\nCommunity is faced with the Herculean task of avoiding or\r\nminimizing the likely short-term to medium-term adverse\r\nimpacts on its members of the North American Free Trade\r\nAgreement (NAFTA) when it takes effect. We have had to\r\nmake vigorous efforts to ensure that the gains achieved\r\nunder existing agreements are not eroded.\r\nSimilarly, conditionality applied to loans by\r\ninternational financial institutions must be designed to be\r\nmore appropriate to developing economies. More\r\nspecifically, adjustment must take place over an extended\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nperiod, must minimize social distress and must be growth-\r\noriented.\r\nMy delegation therefore attaches great importance to\r\nthe formulation of an agenda for development. That process\r\nshould proceed with the sense of urgency and vision with\r\nwhich the undeniably constructive \"Agenda for Peace\" has\r\nbeen promoted. Such an agenda must be forward-looking\r\nand must address fully the wide range of issues pertaining to\r\ndevelopment, taking into account the specific circumstances\r\nand needs of developing countries and groups of countries.\r\nIt must first establish, as its basic premise, the need for a\r\nfavourable international economic environment and a non--\r\ndiscriminatory trading system, the latter being dependent on\r\na speedy, balanced and comprehensive outcome to the\r\nUruguay Round of trade negotiations. Without these\r\nconditions, the efforts of developing countries to build\r\nself-sustaining economies - efforts often accompanied by\r\npainful adjustment strategies and difficult economic-\r\nliberalization programmes - will be frustrated.\r\nThe need for a constructive North-South dialogue to be\r\nreactivated has therefore become urgent, and has certainly\r\nbecome one of the most pressing challenges we face in\r\nelaborating our agenda for development. We were\r\nconsequently appreciative of the initiative taken by the\r\nChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to meet with the\r\nChairman of the Group of 7 in Tokyo. We regard this as an\r\nencouraging beginning.\r\nThe agenda for development cannot be complete if it\r\ndoes not include consideration of the problem of external\r\nindebtedness and formulation of specific solutions for its\r\nresolution. A review of the role and functions of the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions is therefore necessary. Similarly, the\r\nreality and inevitability of regional economic integration\r\nprocesses must be confronted in the agenda for development,\r\nas well as the protection of the environment, following the\r\nground-breaking achievements of the historic United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development last year in\r\nRio de Janeiro.\r\nThe goal of sustainable development provides a holistic\r\nframework for the United Nations and its Member States to\r\nshape a world in which care and respect for human beings\r\nis equalled only by care and respect for the planet which we\r\ninhabit. At the Earth Summit in Rio, we undertook to\r\nimplement measures that would safeguard our natural\r\nhabitat. Some of the decisions taken in Rio have already\r\nbegun to take effect. These include the establishment of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development and the\r\npreparations for the convening of the first Global Conference\r\non Sustainable Development of Small Island States. My\r\ndelegation wishes to stress the importance of this\r\nConference, which is to be held in Barbados next year. We\r\ntake this opportunity to call upon the Members of the\r\nAssembly to give full support to the adoption by the\r\nConference of a plan of action for the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island developing States. This will be\r\nthe first test of our readiness and commitment to implement\r\nthe decisions taken at the Earth Summit.\r\nEqually, Jamaica fully supports the World Conference\r\non Population and Development, to be held in Cairo in 1994;\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development, to be held in\r\nCopenhagen in 1995; and the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, to be held in Beijing in 1995.\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to allude to the 1982 law of\r\nthe sea Convention, which was signed in Montego Bay,\r\nJamaica, 11 years ago and has now been ratified by 58\r\ncountries. I expect that before the end of this forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly the sixtieth ratification will\r\nbe deposited with the Secretary-General, thus setting the\r\nstage for the Convention’s entry into force. There can be no\r\nquestion that support for the Convention continues to be\r\noverwhelming. Our ultimate goal must be to achieve\r\nuniversal participation in a Convention which is designed for\r\nmankind as a whole. It is therefore appropriate that all the\r\nConvention as soon as possible. As the pace of ratification\r\nintensifies, it could serve as a catalyst for deepening the\r\nprocess of universalizing the Convention by addressing\r\ncreatively the manner in which the provisions of the\r\nConvention are to be implemented on an ongoing,\r\ncontemporary basis.\r\nWe must pay a tribute, as well, to the Secretary-General\r\nand his predecessor for the initiative they took to promote a\r\ndialogue aimed at addressing issues of concern to some\r\nStates in order to achieve universal participation in the\r\nConvention. The integrity of the Convention as a whole\r\nmust be maintained, and our search for universality must\r\nrecognize the overwhelming support for the Convention by\r\nthe international community as a whole and the need to\r\npreserve its fundamental aspects. Let us therefore in our\r\nnoble quest for universality concentrate on the manner of the\r\nimplementation of the Convention in those areas of concern\r\nto some States.\r\nIf the United Nations is to play an active and dynamic\r\nrole in promoting a new global partnership, it must examine\r\nits capacity and capability. For that reason, my delegation\r\nagrees that the reform processes now under way should aim\r\nat maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 19\r\nOrganization. Further, my delegation intends to participate\r\nfully in the work of the open-ended ad hoc working group\r\nwhich will continue to consider the process of revitalizing\r\nthe General Assembly. Other discussions related to the\r\nrestructuring of the United Nations system must be\r\ntransparent and informed by the principles of democracy and\r\nthe rules of international law and by those principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter.\r\nMy Government wishes to address the issue of the\r\nSecurity Council in the context of the increased membership\r\nof the United Nations, which rose to 184 this year. The\r\nsurging tide of change over the past five years has seen the\r\nresponsibilities of the Security Council increase, with the\r\nestablishment of 17 peace-keeping operations and the\r\nCouncil’s further involvement in conflict resolution through\r\nthe good offices of the Secretary-General and the dispatch of\r\nfact-finding missions. The time has therefore obviously\r\ncome for a review of the Security Council’s composition to\r\nensure that it is truly representative of the increased\r\nmembership of the United Nations and reflects the\r\ndemocratic principle on which the United Nations is founded -\r\nthat is, the sovereign equality of all States.\r\nThe reform process in which we are now engaged\r\nwithin the United Nations must clearly include the Security\r\nCouncil, the body charged with the responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. A Security\r\nCouncil which is truly representative and functions\r\neffectively has to be a priority for all of us, because peace\r\nand security, in the military and political sense, are\r\ninterwoven with our economic and social security. We in\r\nthe Caribbean cannot, and have no desire to, remain aloof\r\nfrom this debate. We must ensure that a strengthened\r\nUnited Nations is placed in a position to play a dominant\r\nrole in the elaboration of processes of peace and\r\ndevelopment and in their implementation based on genuine\r\ninterdependence, global partnership and shared responsibility.\r\nWe are gathered here because we all have pressing\r\nnational concerns and we believe there remains an enduring\r\nfaith in multilateralism, which carries the potential for\r\nstronger, more broadly based development over the longer\r\nterm, if only all players agree to reaffirm their commitment\r\nand play fully their roles within the global framework of\r\ncooperation.\r\nThere is no doubt that this will be difficult, but shared\r\nobjectives, shared commitment and shared responsibilities\r\nwill ensure a better world for all mankind. As we\r\ncontemplate the challenges posed by the present global,\r\neconomic and political environment, we must commit\r\nourselves to a new dialogue within the United Nations\r\nsystem to forge a global partnership for peace, democracy\r\nand economic progress.\r\nMr. AL-SAHAF (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me to begin by extending to you, Sir, my sincere\r\ncongratulations on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am confident that\r\nyour solid diplomatic background and rich experience will\r\neffectively contribute to the success of the work of this\r\nsession.\r\nMore than ever before, our Organization today needs\r\ncooperation between its Member States if it is to save itself\r\nfrom attempts to divert its course from the spirit and\r\nprinciples of its Charter and thereby turn it into a tool for\r\nserving the selfish interests of certain dominant Powers, first\r\namong which is the United States of America.\r\nThe world has attached great importance to the end of\r\nthe bipolarity that overshadowed the international situation\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nuntil recently and restricted the ability of the United Nations\r\nto address and resolve international problems. The new era,\r\nhowever, has failed to provide the United Nations with the\r\nopportunity to apply the principles, objectives and\r\nmechanisms of the Charter. A single Power - the United\r\nStates of America - has sought to control the manner in\r\nwhich the United Nations addresses international issues and\r\nto steer it in accordance with United States interests.\r\nThe selectivity and double standard that characterize the\r\nrole currently played by the United Nations make it crystal\r\nclear that the United Nations and the Security Council in\r\nparticular have become tools that execute the policies of the\r\nPowers that dominate the Organization. The United Nations\r\nis no longer a world Organization capable of resolving the\r\nproblems and addressing the crises which beset many\r\ncountries and peoples of the world in a manner that is\r\nconsonant with the objectives and principles of its own\r\nCharter.\r\nMr. Kabir (Bangladesh), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWhat did the Security Council ever do to implement its\r\nresolution 487 (1981), on the military aggression perpetrated\r\nby Israel against an Iraqi nuclear reactor devoted to peaceful\r\npurposes? That resolution was adopted 12 years ago and the\r\nSecurity Council has done absolutely nothing to implement\r\nit. Indeed, we have reached the point today at which the\r\nIsraeli Deputy Defence Minister, Mordechai Gur, can\r\narrogantly declare, as he did on 6 June 1993, that Israel does\r\npossess nuclear weapons and that it has the capacity to bomb\r\nthe Arab States with those devices. At the same time, Israel\r\ncontinues to adamantly refuse to sign the non-proliferation\r\nTreaty and the United Nations and the Security Council have\r\ndone absolutely nothing to halt the Israeli programmes of\r\nmass destruction weapons, which include the production and\r\nstockpiling of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons\r\ntogether with the means of their delivery, regardless of the\r\nfact that those programmes constitute a grave threat to the\r\nsecurity and stability of the region and the whole world.\r\nWhile the United Nations is being forced to engage in\r\na military operation in Somalia under the pretext of\r\nproviding humanitarian assistance, the United Nations stands\r\nhelpless and incapable of taking any appropriate action to\r\nput an end to the carnage or to alleviate the bitter human\r\nsuffering in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other parts of\r\nformer Yugoslavia. This paralysis takes place against the\r\nbackdrop of the shifting tides of the positions of the\r\ndominant Powers in line with their own selfish interests and\r\nschemes and their backing away from any measure that\r\nwould help in reaching a solution or put an end to this\r\ntragedy.\r\nBecause of the climate prevailing in the international\r\ncommunity - a climate of selectivity and double standards -\r\nthe gap between North and South continues to widen at the\r\nexpense of the interests of the developing countries and Iraq\r\nfinds itself in a situation that has never been witnessed\r\nbefore by any other founding State Member of the United\r\nNations. This is due to the complications and unfair\r\ntreatment meted to Iraq by the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil under pressure exerted by the United States of\r\nAmerica and its hegemonistic policies towards others.\r\nThe most telling example of the hegemony exercised by\r\nthe United States of America over the United Nations and of\r\nUnited States monopoly of the interpretation and\r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Charter, and use of\r\nthe mechanisms related thereto in the service of purely\r\nAmerican rather than common international interests, is what\r\nhas been done and continues to be done to Iraq at a time\r\nwhen it has declared its commitment to the resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council which it fully implements. In return, Iraq\r\ncontinues to be subjected to acts of aggression which\r\nthreaten its security and territorial integrity and infringe upon\r\nits sovereignty.\r\nIraq also remains deprived of its natural right to obtain\r\nits needs, including those described in international legal\r\nterms as basic human and civilian needs. Those needs are\r\nessential for the people of Iraq if they are to continue to lead\r\na normal life. Iraq also remains deprived of the right to\r\nexport its natural resources while its assets remain frozen.\r\nIraq continues to be denied the right to use its civil aircraft\r\nand ships and continues to be subjected to flagrant military\r\nintervention in its internal affairs, to daily acts of violation\r\nof its airspace, and to the perpetration of a declared\r\nconspiracy against its political system.\r\nIraq has endeavoured, despite all these adverse\r\ncircumstances and difficulties, to contain the crises which\r\ncertain powers have so skilfully orchestrated in order to\r\nperpetrate further aggression against Iraq and create pretexts\r\nfor continuing to impose the iniquitous comprehensive\r\nblockade against it. Within the framework of Iraq’s serious,\r\ncontinuous attempts to reveal the truth, close the door on the\r\nforces of ill-intent and expose their objectives, and driven by\r\nits desire to find solutions to the outstanding issues through\r\na serious responsible dialogue based on justice and fairness\r\nand consistent with international law and the United Nations\r\nCharter, Iraq has called, in a letter dated 30 May 1993 from\r\nthe Foreign Minister of Iraq to the President of the Security\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 21\r\nCouncil, for constructive and comprehensive dialogue with\r\nthe Security Council within the framework of the legal and\r\npractical interrelationship between Iraq’s implementation of\r\nits obligations and the text of resolution 687 (1991) on the\r\none hand, and the Security Council’s implementation of its\r\nown obligations towards Iraq according to the provisions of\r\nthe said resolution, particularly paragraphs 21 and 22, on the\r\nother.\r\nIraq calls for the Security Council to adopt fair and just\r\npositions which would reflect the Council’s respect for its\r\nown obligations and commitments as enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter, and thereby to respect the sovereignty,\r\nindependence, internal security and territorial integrity of\r\nIraq, lift the unjust blockade that has been imposed upon the\r\npeople of Iraq for three years now, and which has inflicted,\r\nand continues to inflict, untold suffering upon them and to\r\nlift all the restrictions that are still imposed without\r\njustification on normal, legitimate Iraqi activities.\r\nIraq has cooperated objectively with all the inspection\r\nteams and missions dispatched by the United Nations, in\r\norder to fulfil its obligations according to the resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council, regardless of how unjust and indeed\r\nhow extremely iniquitous those resolutions are. In fact many\r\nof the officials of those teams and missions have confirmed\r\nthat Iraq has honoured its obligations in implementation of\r\nthe Security Council resolutions.\r\nMay I refer here, by way of example, to the statement\r\nmade by the United Nations Special Commission\r\n(UNSCOM) Executive Chairman, Mr. Rolf Ekeus, on\r\n13 January 1993, in which he said, \"Iraq’s compliance has\r\nbeen a success so far, and it would be tragic if the last 5 per\r\ncent of implementation could not to be carried out.\" Earlier,\r\non 2 September 1992, Mr. Maurizio Zifferero, the head of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection\r\nteam, said, \"Iraq’s nuclear programme stands at zero now.\"\r\nConvinced that Iraq has met all its obligations under\r\nresolution 687 (1991), we called upon the Security Council,\r\nboth as a collective body and as individual Member States,\r\njust as we had long been calling upon the Special\r\nCommission, to conduct a technical, professional and legal\r\ndialogue with Iraq in order to specify the extent to which\r\nresolution 687 (1991) in general, and section C thereof in\r\nparticular, have been implemented, so that the Council may\r\nconsider implementing paragraphs 21 and 22 of the\r\nresolution, which pertain to the lifting of the economic\r\nsanctions imposed on Iraq. The dialogue proposed by Iraq\r\nwas also meant to strip away all the pretexts that have\r\ncontinued to be used to mask the illegal and aggressive\r\nmeasures unilaterally taken by certain individual States\r\nagainst Iraq and its territorial integrity. The most flagrant of\r\nthose measures are the so-called \"no-fly zones\" imposed on\r\nnorthern and southern Iraq and the military acts of\r\naggression perpetrated by the United States against Iraq on\r\n17 January 1993 and 27 June 1993.\r\nWhen the Security Council responded, in July 1993, to\r\nour call for dialogue and sent the Executive Chairman of the\r\nSpecial Commission to Baghdad to conduct talks with the\r\nIraqi side, we welcomed the visit and held intensive, frank\r\nand constructive discussions with Mr. Ekeus, through which\r\nwe reached an agreement to resolve a number of issues and\r\nto continue our dialogue in earnest on grounds that are just,\r\nfair, logical and consistent with international law and the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nWe presented to Mr. Ekeus, and through him to the\r\nSecurity Council, a position paper clearly expressing the way\r\nin which Iraq envisages the relationship between Iraq’s\r\nresponsibilities towards the Security Council and its\r\nresolutions, on the one hand, and the responsibilities of the\r\nSecurity Council, both as a body and as Member States,\r\ntowards Iraq’s firm rights and legitimate demands, foremost\r\namong which are the following: to respect the sovereignty,\r\ninternal security and dignity of the people and State of Iraq;\r\nto guarantee Iraq’s right to development and to industrial,\r\nscientific and technological progress; to implement\r\nparagraph 22 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991),\r\npertaining to the lifting of the embargo on Iraq now that Iraq\r\nhas accomplished what is required of it under the provisions\r\nof section C of that resolution; to work in earnest towards\r\nthe implementation of paragraph 14 of resolution 687 (1991),\r\npertaining to the establishment in the Middle East of a zone\r\nfree of weapons of mass destruction and the means of their\r\ndelivery and to bring to an immediate end the so-called\r\n\"no-fly zones\" imposed on northern and southern Iraq, which\r\nconstitute an illegal use of armed force by three permanent\r\nmember States of the Security Council, aimed at interfering\r\nin the internal affairs of a Member State of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIraq reiterated its positive positions and its desire for\r\ndialogue during the meetings held last month here in New\r\nYork by the Iraqi high-level technical delegation. We have\r\nalso endeavoured to ensure that this positive spirit prevails\r\nin the current round of meetings which started in Baghdad\r\non 2 October 1993. We look forward to seeing this round\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsucceed in solving all outstanding issues in a complete and\r\nfinal manner so that the Security Council may begin in\r\nearnest to implement paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991)\r\nwhich states that the Security Council:\r\n\"Decides that upon the approval by the Security\r\nCouncil of the programme called for in paragraph 19\r\nabove and upon Council agreement that Iraq has\r\ncompleted all actions contemplated in paragraphs 8, 9,\r\n10, 11, 12 and 13 above, the prohibitions against the\r\nimport of commodities and products originating in Iraq\r\nand the prohibitions against financial transactions\r\nrelated thereto contained in resolution 661 (1990) shall\r\nhave no further force or effect\".\r\nIn view of these developments, and in order for the\r\nprinciples of justice and equity and of the mutuality of rights\r\nand obligations between Iraq and the Security Council to\r\nprevail, we hereby call upon all countries of the world to\r\nsupport our initiative for dialogue and understanding between\r\nthe Council and Iraq so that such dialogue may lead without\r\ndelay to the lifting of the unjust and iniquitous blockade\r\nimposed on our country, and thereby to put an end to the\r\nmethods of coercion, threats and aggression being used\r\nagainst our country.\r\nWe also call upon the countries of the world to urge the\r\nSecurity Council, both as a collective body and as individual\r\nMember States, to consider Iraq’s legitimate demands as\r\nexpressed in the Iraqi position paper submitted to the\r\nSecurity Council in July 1993. The paper deals with the\r\nmost important issues, especially respect for Iraq’s\r\nsovereignty, internal security and territorial integrity, the\r\nlifting of the iniquitous blockade, the removal of the \"no-fly\r\nzones\" illegally imposed on parts of Iraq and abstaining from\r\nany further aggression against Iraq.\r\nThe people of Iraq are being subjected to inhumane\r\npolicies and practices that have further aggravated their\r\nsuffering which increases from one day to the next. The\r\ndomination by the United States and its allies over the\r\nactivities of the Sanctions Committee, which was set up in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 661 (1990), has\r\nmade that Committee hostage to premeditated political\r\nobjectives and ill intentions against Iraq and its people. The\r\nCommittee has ignored the basic civilian and human needs\r\nof the Iraqi people to the extent that it has refused to allow\r\nIraq to obtain much needed medical supplies as well as\r\nequipment and educational supplies for its schools. The\r\nCommittee has gone as far as to consider paint for school\r\ndesks and blackboards as well as ink as proscribed materials\r\nthat the Iraqi people should not be permitted to obtain.\r\nIn refusing to grant the permission to obtain any of\r\nthose essential civilian requirements, it resorts to flimsy\r\npretexts and unacceptable justifications. For instance, the\r\nCommittee has refused to allow pencils and notebooks to be\r\nsupplied to Iraq’s schoolchildren, claiming that the quantity\r\nrequested was too large. The Committee has also rejected\r\na request for the supply of medical equipment, beds and\r\nair-conditioning systems for Iraqi hospitals. The reason\r\ngiven for that refusal was that the end user was not known.\r\nWhat irony! The Sanctions Committee has refused to allow\r\nwater purification materials to be supplied to Iraq, rejected\r\na request submitted by a company for the reconstruction of\r\na factory producing medical syringes in Iraq and refused to\r\nallow the importation of spare parts for a baby-food factory\r\nin Iraq under the pretext that such spare parts would\r\ncontribute to the expansion of the country’s industrial\r\ncapability.\r\nThe practices of a limited number of Member States in\r\nthe Sanctions Committee which seems to have inherited the\r\nveto privilege under the cover of general consensus, have\r\ndemonstrated beyond all doubt that the embargo is geared\r\ntowards destroying Iraqi society with premeditated\r\npersistence and through organized and calculated efforts\r\ndriven by political motives that are contrary to all values,\r\nlaws and norms acceptable to the international community\r\nnow or in the past.\r\nThe war of destruction launched against Iraq by the\r\nUnited States and its allies, the continued imposition of the\r\ncomprehensive blockade and the denial of Iraq’s right to\r\nexport its oil and use its frozen assets in foreign banks have\r\nall combined to make Iraq unable to provide even the most\r\nelementary of its people’s basic humanitarian needs, such as\r\nfood and medication. The result has been a huge increase in\r\nmortality among children and the elderly, due to the grave\r\nshortage of medicines. On top of all its other difficulties in\r\nvarious fields, Iraq suffers from, for example, an acute\r\nshortage of medicines for the treatment of cancer, kidney\r\nproblems, heart disease, diabetes, blood pressure disorders,\r\neye diseases, diarrhoea, tuberculosis and other serious\r\ndiseases. Over the months that have elapsed in 1993,\r\ntuberculosis-related fatalities among children have risen by\r\n81 times over the figure registered for the corresponding\r\nperiod in 1989; and this is but one example.\r\nI do not wish to elaborate on the difficult humanitarian\r\nconditions of the Iraqi people. The reports by the various\r\nmissions and agencies of the United Nations have warned\r\nagainst the dangerous results of the deteriorating food and\r\nhealth situation brought upon the Iraqi people as a result of\r\nthe blockade.\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 23\r\nThe most recent of those reports is Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) document 237, issued in\r\nJuly 1993 under the title \"Special Warning\". This document\r\ndepicts the deterioration of Iraq’s food situation as a result\r\nof the difficulties facing the agricultural sector because of\r\nacute shortages of equipment and pesticides and the spread\r\nof agricultural epidemics. The FAO report also points out\r\nthat the economic sanctions imposed upon Iraq have led to\r\nthe spread of deprivation on a massive scale, thus exposing\r\nthe vast majority of the Iraqi population to acute food\r\nshortages and malnutrition, particularly children under five\r\nyears of age. The report also states that the economic\r\nblockade has practically paralysed the country’s economy\r\nand led to continued deprivation and the spread of massive\r\nhuman suffering.\r\nNot content with its military aggression against Iraq on\r\n17 January 1991 or with all the inhuman practices it has\r\npursued against the Iraqi people, the United States of\r\nAmerica has continued to perpetuate direct and unilateral\r\nacts of military aggression against Iraq under various false\r\npretexts and flimsy justifications. In addition to the first\r\ncolossal aggression of 1991, the United States perpetrated\r\ntwo further acts of aggression against Iraq’s civilian\r\npopulation and civilian installations on 17 January 1993 and\r\n27 June 1993. These two additional acts of aggression\r\nresulted in the loss of many innocent civilian lives among\r\nchildren, women and elderly people.\r\nAs a permanent member of the Security Council, the\r\nUnited States of America has a double responsibility to\r\nabide by international law and the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe United States should be the last country to resort to the\r\nuse of force in resolving disputes, yet it perpetrated\r\naggression against Iraq on the basis of unfounded and absurd\r\nallegations that there was a conspiracy against the life of the\r\nformer United States President. In so doing, the United\r\nStates Government justified its action by a twisted\r\ninterpretation of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter\r\nthat was totally alien to that article’s letter and spirit.\r\nThis behaviour constitutes a grave escalation of a policy\r\nthat has been and will certainly continue to be a threat to\r\ninternational peace and security, a policy that violates the\r\nright of States to self-defence, as enshrined in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations. The behaviour of the United States, in\r\nparticular its aggression of 27 June 1993, has met with\r\nrejection and condemnation from many countries round the\r\nworld, including some allies of the United States itself.\r\nAs regards the issue of human rights, Iraq proceeds\r\nfrom a complete belief in those rights and in the fact that\r\nrespect for, and protection of, human rights remains an\r\nunquestionable element upon which the internal structure of\r\nsociety is established and an element that contributes\r\npositively to the establishment of peace and justice at the\r\ninternational level. It is on the basis of such conviction and\r\nsuch understanding that Iraq has acceded to many\r\ninternational covenants on human rights. Iraq has also\r\nhonoured its obligations by submitting regular reports\r\nregarding the situation of human rights. While we realize\r\nthat many positive developments have taken place in the\r\nfield of human rights, reflecting the widespread recognition\r\nof their importance, a recognition further cemented by legal\r\nprovisions in the various international covenants, these\r\ndevelopments have not been accompanied, in terms of real\r\napplication, by an earnest endeavour to help create the right\r\nclimate for the declared legal provisions to be implemented\r\nin accordance with the greatly varying circumstances\r\nprevailing in various States, according to each one’s cultural\r\nbackground, religious beliefs and level of progress and\r\ndevelopment. On the contrary: it can be seen that the\r\nconcept of human rights has become a weapon used by\r\ncertain States possessing the means of influence with which\r\nto exert discriminatory pressure on other States for selfish\r\npolitical objectives and interests rather than for the\r\nrealization of common objectives and interests of the\r\ninternational community. What is particularly worrying to\r\nus is the neglect shown towards basic rights upheld by the\r\ninternational community and declared as governing principles\r\nsuch as the right to self-determination, the right to\r\ndevelopment, the right of States to respect for their\r\nsovereignty, stability and territorial integrity as well as\r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs.\r\nThe great challenges facing the United Nations put the\r\nOrganization at a decisive crossroads, beyond which we shall\r\nsee the will of the international community either totally\r\nparalysed under the influence of dominant Powers, or\r\nsearching for an outlet through an endeavour to restore\r\nbalance to the mechanisms governing the process of\r\ndecision-making and decision-implementation in the various\r\nUnited Nations agencies, with a view to ensuring the\r\neffectiveness of the Organization and guaranteeing its ability\r\nto resolve international problems in accordance with rules of\r\nfairness, justice and international law, as well as ensuring the\r\nrevitalization of the role of the United Nations on the basis\r\nof compatible and unified concepts and criteria and away\r\nfrom double standards.\r\nThe enhancement of the United Nations ability to\r\nmaintain peace requires, above all, strict adherence to the\r\nobjectives and principles of the Charter, particularly the\r\nprinciples of the sovereign equality of States, the right of\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\npeoples to self-determination, to non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States and to observance of the rules of\r\ninternational law.\r\nIraq, as a founding Member of the United Nations, is\r\nextremely anxious that the Organization’s name and emblem\r\nremain worthy of respect and continue to be regarded as a\r\nbeacon of hope by all peoples of the world. We believe that\r\nmembership in the Security Council should go hand in hand\r\nwith the new realities brought about by the increased\r\nmembership of the United Nations, and that this should be\r\ndone in a manner that would bring about a more equitable\r\nand balanced representation of all United Nations Member\r\nStates. The Council should abide by the principles of clarity\r\nand openness in its decision-making process; it should also\r\noperate with due regard to respect for the sovereign rights of\r\nall States.\r\nMy country supports the thesis put forth by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report \"An Agenda for Peace\"\r\nregarding the importance of the role assigned to the General\r\nAssembly by the United Nations Charter, especially in the\r\nfield of the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe achievement of the United Nations objectives\r\nrequires that the mechanisms of the General Assembly\r\nshould be strengthened within the framework of its spheres\r\nof competence stipulated by the Charter and that this should\r\nbe done through discussion and the adoption of resolutions\r\non subjects of international importance.\r\nThe strength and vitality of the United Nations are\r\nclosely linked to the extent of participation by its Member\r\nStates in the process of decision-making and to their\r\nequitable representation in the various specialized organs and\r\nagencies.\r\nThe United Nations Secretary-General, in his report\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\", highlights the fundamental fact that\r\nsocial peace is just as important as strategic and political\r\npeace. He stresses that peace cannot be guaranteed within\r\nthe framework of narrow military concept, as there are\r\nseveral economic and environmental factors that play their\r\npart in the maintenance of peace and that those factors can\r\nthemselves become the fuel for the eruption of conflicts and\r\nwars between peoples.\r\nThe need to maintain international peace and security\r\nputs the United Nations face to face with the responsibility\r\nof removing the causes of conflict in which economic factors\r\nplay the vital role.\r\nIf it is said today that the world has put the dangers of\r\nthe cold war behind it, we must remind ourselves that our\r\nworld faces very real dangers that arise from the grave\r\ndeterioration in the world economic situation, particularly the\r\nbitter suffering of the developing countries, their increasing\r\npoverty and the frustration of their development\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe gap has been growing wider and wider between the\r\nrich industrial North and the poor South which is seeking an\r\nopportunity for survival as it witnesses the prices of its basic\r\ncommodities tumble, its foreign trade deteriorate, and its\r\nresources become prey to plunder and extortion.\r\nPeace is a concept that cannot be divided. It is a\r\nfundamental right for mankind, recognized by all religions\r\nas well as by international covenants. That indivisible\r\nconcept of peace must combine all dimensions, especially\r\nthe economic which, if missing, exposes the international\r\ncommunity to grave problems and dangerous conflicts.\r\nTo really guarantee international peace and security, we\r\nmust realize that this depends on the extent to which the\r\ninherent causes of conflict are removed and that economic\r\nand social development constitute the most important\r\nfoundation upon which to establish international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nOnce we realize this, we shall find that many of the\r\ncauses of instability arise from economic and social factors.\r\nThe United Nations should address such factors in all\r\nseriousness and should give them priority in the activities of\r\nits various organs, particularly the General Assembly and its\r\nspecialized agencies, in a manner that would heighten the\r\nefficacy of the United Nations and the role it plays in\r\nfacilitating cooperation between States in the fields of\r\neconomic and social development and in other areas of\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nThis responsibility should be shouldered by the United\r\nNations on the basis of the principles enshrined in its\r\nCharter for the enhancement of the factors of economic\r\ndevelopment and progress and the establishment of\r\nmultilateral non-discriminatory international economic order\r\nwhich would be based on respect for the choices made by\r\ncountries and peoples and which would encourage respect\r\nfor mutual interests and put an end to exploitation and\r\nhegemony.\r\nThe United Nations should focus its efforts on the\r\nsearch for the practical formulae that would lead to\r\nconsolidating the national infrastructures and enhancing the\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 25\r\ncapabilities of the poorer and developing countries and help\r\nthem overcome their difficulties, implement their\r\ndevelopment programmes and narrow the huge gap existing\r\nat present between the rich industrial countries and the\r\ndeveloping countries. Such an effort will no doubt serve the\r\ncause of stability, security and peace in the world.\r\nMr. OULD MOINE (Mauritania) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): Please allow me first of all to extend to\r\nAmbassador Insanally of Guyana on behalf of the\r\nMauritanian delegation its most sincere congratulations on\r\nhis unanimous election to the presidency of this forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that his\r\nexperience and his comprehensive knowledge of the\r\nworkings of the Organization, together with his personal\r\nqualities, will be the best possible guarantee for the success\r\nof this session and the completion of its work with the\r\nresults we all hope for.\r\nIt is also a pleasure for me to congratulate his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nof Bulgaria, on the exemplary manner in which he conducted\r\nthe work of the preceding session.\r\nIt is also a pleasure for me to reiterate to my brother,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our confidence and great respect\r\nfor the efforts he has constantly deployed since he assumed\r\nthe duties of Secretary-General of the United Nations, to\r\nconsolidate the universal reputation of the Organization and\r\nto strengthen its credibility and capacity to act.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to welcome\r\nthe States which have recently acceded to the membership\r\nof the Organization and to extend to them the\r\ncongratulations of the Mauritanian delegation. We are\r\nconvinced that their presence in our midst will consolidate\r\nthe Organization’s effectiveness in the interest of all its\r\nmembers.\r\nThe past year has not witnessed any tangible\r\nimprovement in the international economic situation. A\r\ncombination of negative factors such as natural disasters and\r\nthe deterioration of commodity prices continues to widen the\r\ngap between developing countries and the industrialized\r\ncountries, hence the failure of efforts made by the former to\r\nemerge from the sphere of underdevelopment and poverty.\r\nThis situation has continued to deteriorate because of the\r\ncrisis provoked by the growing increase of the debt burden,\r\nwhich is a threat not only to the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of developing countries but also to their very\r\nsurvival. It is now an acknowledged fact that Africa is the\r\ncontinent which suffers most from the deteriorating\r\ninternational economic situation, in particular because of its\r\ntremendous debt burden. How could one really believe that\r\ncountries which have barely enough resources to meet their\r\nown daily needs and the needs of their people might be able\r\nto cope with such obligations? Is it not time for the\r\ninternational community, and the industrialized countries in\r\nparticular, to give thought to the gravity of such a situation\r\nand to consider the possibility of participating more actively\r\nin the quest for realistic and effective solutions to this very\r\ncomplex and important problem? In this context, I use the\r\nterms \"realistic\" and \"effective\" advisedly, because it is these\r\ntwo attributes which have been lacking in all the attempts\r\nmade in this field to date.\r\nAs for the economic and development situation in\r\ngeneral, for all the conventions, strategies and agreements\r\naimed at promoting development, that situation has remained\r\nstatic and in many countries it has actually deteriorated.\r\nTangible progress could have been achieved in terms of real\r\ndevelopment for these countries in general and for the\r\nAfrican countries in particular if the industrialized countries\r\nhad honoured the commitments they made in certain\r\ndocuments - commitments such as the allocation of 0.7 per\r\ncent of their national income to official development\r\nassistance and if those countries had implemented the\r\nprogramme adopted at the Paris 1990 Conference.\r\nIn this struggle for the development of Africa,\r\nMauritania remains convinced that the more the sources of\r\nexternal aid dry up, the greater the need will be for self-\r\nreliance and the mobilization by every country of its own\r\nresources. That is the reason why, despite the adverse\r\ninternational situation and the unfavourable climatic\r\nconditions, we have been able to meet our basic\r\ncommitments to our partners in development, whether they\r\nbe States or institutions.\r\nIn 1992, our country achieved a 2.5 per cent rate of\r\ngrowth. It financed from its own resources 20 per cent of\r\nits investment budget, which amounted to 17.5 billion\r\nouguiyas. Here I should like to express, in the most solemn\r\npossible way and in the name of the Government and people\r\nof Mauritania, our thanks and our gratitude to fraternal and\r\nfriendly States and organizations for the considerable\r\nassistance they gave us.\r\nIt is clear that there is an organic link between\r\ndevelopment, on the one hand, and democracy and respect\r\nfor human rights, on the other. Indeed, what value could be\r\nattached to prosperity and economic progress if we do not\r\nuphold human rights and safeguard freedoms? What\r\nobjective for any responsible Government could be more\r\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nnoble than having its people participate in an effective way\r\nin the management of their own affairs and the mastering of\r\ntheir own destiny? In contrast to the situation we have just\r\nseen which prevails in the economic sphere, the past year\r\nhas seen a tangible improvement and an increased interest in\r\nthe field of upholding and respecting human rights. That\r\nimprovement and that heightened interest were made evident\r\nin the holding of the World Conference on Human Rights in\r\nVienna, at which our country was represented by a large\r\nhigh-level delegation headed by our Prime Minister. That\r\nhigh-level representation reflected the great importance our\r\nGovernment attaches to the question of human rights and\r\ndemonstrated its unshakable faith in the need to formulate a\r\nuniversal concept of human rights applicable to all without\r\nany discrimination. There can be no doubt that the\r\nimplementation of the important results of this Conference\r\nwill strengthen the progress of peoples towards prosperity\r\nand stability.\r\nThe importance Mauritania attaches to the events on the\r\ninternational scene regarding human rights bespeaks the\r\ncommitment of our Government to bring our country out of\r\nthe emergency rule situation that used to prevail in\r\nMauritania as well as in many other countries. To that end,\r\nour Government set for itself, as a priority, the guaranteeing\r\nof fundamental civil rights and the effective involvement of\r\nits people in the management of their affairs and in the\r\neconomic and social development policies of the country. In\r\nthat respect, I am proud to be able to declare here that there\r\nis not a single political prisoner in our country.\r\nThe democratic process started with the organization of\r\nmunicipal elections, which were a sort of school for\r\ndemocracy within the context of which citizens exercised\r\ntheir freedom of expression, freedom of speech, the virtue of\r\ntolerance and freedom of choice. These stages resulted in\r\nthe adoption on 12 July 1991 of a constitution which\r\nguaranteed all fundamental freedoms set forth in the\r\nuniversal declarations and conventions on human rights. The\r\nconstitution guarantees a clear separation of the executive,\r\nlegislative and judicial powers. These various institutions\r\nwere set up and are currently operating in their respective\r\nspheres of competence within the context of political\r\npluralism and the freedom of speech envisaged in the\r\nconstitution - for the first time in the history of our country.\r\nSeventeen political parties have been set up, and more than\r\n100 newspapers and magazines have been authorized to be\r\npublished in complete freedom.\r\nGiven our awareness of the need to consolidate this\r\ngenuine democracy and to ensure respect for freedoms and\r\nrights of all social groups, a law guaranteeing trade union\r\npluralism that protects, in a clear-cut manner, all the rights\r\nof Mauritanian workers was enacted in order to protect the\r\nrights of citizens in the face of administrative red tape, and\r\nan independent ombudsman, with the rank of Minister has\r\nbeen appointed to investigate complaints relating to\r\nadministrative and social problems. To deal with\r\nadministrative problems and to complete the election of\r\ninstitutions as set forth in the constitution, the President of\r\nthe Republic issued a decree which brought forward the date\r\nof municipal elections. In the field of social affairs, the\r\nGovernment, which has always attached special importance\r\nto literacy and to the promotion of the status of women as\r\nwell as to women’s involvement in national development\r\npolicies, created a department for each of these sectors.\r\nHis Excellency the President of the Republic has shown\r\non more than one occasion the interest he attaches to youth\r\nand children as an essential asset whose role is absolutely\r\nindispensable for the present and future of our nation.\r\nIn the health sector, the choice we have opted for,\r\nnamely health for all has been based on three essential\r\npoints: first, a continuation of the hygienic efforts and\r\npreventive care in their various aspects; secondly,\r\ndevelopment of specialized medical services; and thirdly,\r\nmaking available to citizens essential medicines at reasonable\r\nprices.\r\nThe satisfaction we feel at the progress achieved in the\r\nfield of consolidating democracy and respect for human\r\nrights in our country and for our people is equalled only by\r\nour feeling of concern at the violations to which those same\r\nrights are subjected in other countries and against the\r\ninterests of the peoples in other regions of the world. This\r\nsituation is a threat to peace and harmony in the entire\r\nworld.\r\nDoes it stand to reason that the lives, property and holy\r\nplace of religions of peoples could continue to be trampled\r\nand desecrated at the very heart of a continent such as\r\nEurope with its age-old traditions of democracy and respect\r\nfor human rights? The atrocities of torture, mass murders\r\nand ethnic liquidation are all crimes which the Serbs in\r\nparticular have been perpetrating daily in full view of and\r\nwith the full knowledge of the entire world, against the\r\nMuslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This naked defiance\r\nof the entire international community, requires that the\r\ncommunity as a whole should assume its full responsibilities\r\nand act accordingly. In view of this situation, we call once\r\nagain for pressure to be brought to bear by all legal means\r\non the Serbs and Croats so that they may comply with the\r\nwill of the international community.\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 27\r\nMauritania has always set as a priority the question of\r\nPalestine. It reiterates its constant support for the fraternal\r\nPalestinian people under the leadership of its sole and\r\nlegitimate representative, the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO). It is in that spirit that Mauritania\r\nwelcomed the agreement concluded between the PLO and\r\nIsrael, because we believe it is an important step which will\r\nlead, we hope, to a comprehensive solution to the Middle\r\nEast problem that would enable the Palestinian people to\r\nregain all their legitimate rights, including the right to self-\r\ndetermination, and guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from\r\nall the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of\r\nAl Quds. It should also make it possible for all resolutions\r\nadopted by the Security Council relating to this problem to\r\nbe implemented, and it should create conditions conducive\r\nto peaceful coexistence between all peoples of the region.\r\nMy country, which has the honour of presiding over the\r\npresent session of the League of Arab States, would like to\r\nreaffirm here that Arabs have never been warmongers. To\r\nthe contrary, they have always been a nation oriented\r\ntowards peace, and working for peace. Now today, the\r\nArabs, and the Palestinians in particular, have demonstrated\r\nthat for peace they are capable of going beyond hatred, the\r\npain, the wounds of the past and the many, many sufferings\r\nto which they were subjected during the Middle East\r\nconflict. Could they have made such sacrifices for peace if\r\nthat were not the foundation, the very foundation of their\r\ncivilization, and one of their primordial values? Could they\r\nhave done so if peace were not a way of life and an end in\r\nitself in their traditions? Does not \"peace\" in their language\r\nmean life? Those whose salutation means \"peace\" and\r\nwhose prayer ends with peace; those who, when they are\r\ntransgressed against, react by calling for peace; a people\r\nbearing such values surely deserves the support of the\r\nOrganization in bringing about a just and comprehensive\r\npeace after which they aspire. It is the duty of the\r\ninternational community as a whole to respond positively to\r\nthis just aspiration for the recovery of legitimate rights.\r\nIn this part of the world, the Middle East, the\r\nconsequences of the Gulf war are still there to see in every\r\ncountry of the region. Mauritania, which has always\r\naffirmed and continues to affirm its commitment to\r\ninternational legality and which expressed total rejection of\r\nany violation of the independence of the sister country,\r\nKuwait and the safety of its citizens, rejects any violation of\r\nthe unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. We appeal to the\r\ninternational community to alleviate the suffering of the\r\nchildren and women of Iraq.\r\nBecause of the moderation, the sagacity and the\r\nobjectivity which have always characterized the postures of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates, and also because of the legitimate\r\nposition of this country with respect to Abu Musa, Greater\r\nTunb and Lesser Tunb Islands which belong to it, Mauritania\r\nsupports the position of the United Arab Emirates. We hope\r\nthat Iran, the sister Muslim country and neighbour, will\r\nrespond favourably to the legitimate claims of the State of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates.\r\nThe Middle East is not the only Arab region which\r\nsuffers from tension. In the Arab Maghreb, despite\r\nsustained efforts which have been made for almost five years\r\nnow, aimed at laying the foundations of a promising\r\nregrouping which would promise prosperity for the peoples\r\nof the region, as we have seen in the practical and important\r\nresults reached at the summit of Nouakchott held in\r\nNovember 1992, two problems continue to be of concern to\r\nour leaders and our people. The first problem is the\r\nquestion of Western Sahara. In that respect, the United\r\nNations continues to make efforts to smooth out the\r\ndifficulties, which have heretofore made it impossible to\r\nreach a solution. While expressing our hope that these\r\ndifficulties will soon be ironed out, we will continue our\r\nefforts together with the United Nations and the parties\r\ninvolved to reach a just and lasting solution. That solution\r\nwould, no doubt, be an important stage towards the building\r\nof an Arab Maghreb, and a factor of stability and\r\ndevelopment in the region.\r\nThe second problem is the blockade imposed on the\r\nfraternal people of Libya, which is detrimental to the other\r\nMaghreb peoples as well. In view of the willingness\r\nexpressed by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to cooperate with\r\nthe United Nations and the parties concerned, we should like\r\nto express our hope that the resolution on the blockade will\r\nsoon be revised, and that this question will be dealt with\r\nthrough dialogue and understanding.\r\nAs for the southern part of the African continent, we\r\nshould like to record our satisfaction at the new signs of the\r\ndisappearance of the last bastion of racial segregation, and\r\nthis is a good occasion to pay tribute to the wisdom and\r\nfarsightedness of President Nelson Mandela for the path he\r\nhas followed in dealing with this question. We express here\r\nour hope that the measures adopted will be fully\r\nimplemented so that a democratic non-racial regime could be\r\nset up so that it may guarantee the rights of all citizens of\r\nthis sister African country.\r\nIn Somalia, a brother people continues to suffer the ill\r\neffects of internal divisions, war and famine. If operation\r\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\n\"Restore hope\", begun last December, resulted in a certain\r\namount of progress in humanitarian terms, unfortunately, its\r\npolitical outcome has not been satisfactory to all concerned.\r\nWe hope that the international community will step up its\r\nefforts to achieve the objective initially defined for that\r\noperation. We also appeal to our Somali brethren to\r\novercome their factional differences and quarrels so that the\r\nSomali nation may survive.\r\nTurning to the question of Angola, we hope that our\r\nAngolan people will listen to the voice of reason and\r\ncooperate with the United Nations Representative with a\r\nview to ending this fratricidal war, which serves the interests\r\nof none of the parties.\r\nWith regard to Liberia, we note with satisfaction the\r\npeace agreement that was signed on 25 July 1993, under the\r\nauspices of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates. We have every hope that the opposing sides will\r\nimplement that agreement and put an end to this destructive\r\nwar, which has been devastating the country for several\r\nyears.\r\nIn Rwanda, there are new prospects for peace and\r\nstability as a result of the signing, in Arusha, on\r\n4 August 1993, of a peace agreement between the parties to\r\nthe conflict. We can only applaud this positive step while\r\nexpressing the hope that it will mark the beginning of a new\r\nera for the people of Rwanda.\r\nIt is encouraging that Mozambique has returned to a\r\nstate of normalcy following the signing, on 4 October 1992,\r\nof an agreement that made possible the initiation of United\r\nNations operations there. At the political level, President\r\nJoaquim Chissano and the leader of RENAMO met on 23\r\nAugust 1993, thus confirming their determination to put an\r\nend to the instability that their country has been experiencing\r\nfor several decades.\r\nIn Asia, the Cambodian people has achieved a major\r\nvictory with the holding of the recent elections. All\r\nCambodians, under the leadership of His Majesty King\r\nNorodom Sihanouk, must now consolidate that achievement\r\nso that harmony may prevail and national reconstruction\r\nbegin. There is no doubt that the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community will stand by the Cambodians, as\r\nthey have done in the past.\r\nThe United Nations, which has an indispensable role to\r\nperform in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, deserves our full support and help. The\r\nOrganization’s universal character, which is today given\r\nexpression in the membership of 184 independent States,\r\nrequires, more than ever, a revision of its structures and its\r\nmethods of operation - in particular, through enlargement of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nIn that context, we should like to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report \"An Agenda for Peace\", the\r\nstudy and implementation of certain aspects of which has\r\nalready begun. In this respect, I am very pleased to\r\nunderscore the fact that at its last meeting, which was held\r\nin Cairo, the Council of the League of Arab States\r\nrecommended the strengthening of cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the League.\r\nIn two years’ time the United Nations will celebrate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of its founding. My country has the\r\nhonour of being involved in the bureau of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for that event, which, we feel, will be a real and\r\nimportant watershed in the life of the Organization, as well\r\nas an opportunity for its Members to assess the progress that\r\nthe international community has made towards achieving the\r\nnoble objectives that were set for the Organization when it\r\nwas established in 1945. Let us ensure that that assessment\r\nwill be positive. Let us do so by redoubling our efforts to\r\nestablish justice and peace and to promote the cause of man\r\n- the means and the end of all social- and economic-\r\ndevelopment operations. For its part, the Islamic Republic\r\nof Mauritania will continue to move forward in this\r\ndirection, in accordance with its unfailing determination to\r\nachieve development - development for man and by man.\r\nMr. Ssemogerere (Uganda): I wish, on behalf of the\r\nUganda delegation, to join those representatives who have\r\nalready congratulated Mr. Insanally of Guyana on his well-\r\ndeserved election to the presidency of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. His election to\r\nthis high office is a tribute to his personal qualities and also\r\nan honour to Guyana, with which Uganda enjoys warm and\r\nfriendly relations. Given his wide experience, and especially\r\nhis intimate knowledge of the United Nations, I am\r\nconfident that he will successfully guide its deliberations\r\nduring the session. In this effort, he can count on Uganda’s\r\ncooperation and support.\r\nI wish also to express the appreciation of my delegation\r\nto Mr. Insanally’s predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\r\nBulgaria, who presided with distinction at the forty-seventh\r\nsession.\r\nOur appreciation goes, equally, to the distinguished\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has\r\nprovided dynamic and courageous leadership to our\r\nOrganization. He has come to grips with one of the biggest\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 29\r\nchallenges to the international community - conflict\r\nresolution - and his incisive reports are an inspiration to us\r\nall.\r\nIt is with happiness that, on behalf of the people and\r\nGovernment of Uganda, I express a warm welcome to the\r\nCzech Republic, Slovakia, Eritrea, the Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Monaco and Andorra as new\r\nMembers of the United Nations. We look forward to\r\nworking closely with them in our common efforts to fulfil\r\nthe objectives and achieve the goals of the Organization.\r\nAllow me to convey to the people and Government of\r\nIndia Uganda’s profound sympathy and solidarity following\r\nthe tragic earthquake that struck that country last week,\r\ncausing enormous destruction and massive loss of life.\r\nThe dramatic end of the cold war created a wave of\r\noptimism. The ideological rivalry and the attendant\r\nconfrontation between the major Powers yielded to\r\nunderstanding and cooperation, and the nightmare of the\r\nnuclear annihilation of the world receded - even if, in our\r\nminds, it was not totally eliminated. We believe that we are\r\nwitnessing the dawn of a new era that promises the\r\nbeginning of a new order based on peace, justice and equity\r\n- as envisaged in the United Nations Charter - both within\r\nand between nations. Whether we can succeed in attaining\r\nthat lofty goal is one of the challenges of our time.\r\nMr. Khan (Pakistan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nHowever, the events of the last few years have\r\ntempered this sense of optimism. We see contradictory\r\ndevelopments - some positive and others negative. On the\r\none hand, there are positive developments in disarmament,\r\nthe resolution of conflicts, and the emergence of democratic\r\ngovernance in many countries. But, on the other hand, we\r\nhave witnessed the dangers of ethnic and religious\r\nintolerance, which have generated centrifugal forces in many\r\nparts of the world, often with debilitating tolls in human life,\r\nsuffering and the destruction of property. I wish to caution\r\nagainst the danger of making purely ethnic and religious\r\nconsiderations the basis for forging a modern State. The\r\nchallenge is to find democratic solutions for peaceful and\r\nequitable coexistence in a heterogeneous society.\r\nThe divide between North and South, reflecting\r\naffluence on the one hand and widespread poverty and\r\ndeprivation on the other, is widening. The same division\r\nbetween the haves and the have-nots is reflected within\r\nmany nations. Clearly, the deterioration of economic\r\nconditions in developing countries, if not adequately\r\naddressed, can only lead to despair and frustration. In the\r\nlong run, such developments will pose a danger to\r\ninternational peace and security. The international\r\ncommunity should keep at the top of its agenda the urgent\r\ntask of ensuring that the positive changes ushered in by the\r\ndemise of the cold war equitably benefit all mankind. It is\r\nincumbent upon us to encourage and promote the positive\r\ntrends while endeavouring to eliminate or minimize the\r\nnegative aspects. Marginalization of developing countries\r\ncannot be in the interest of a better world. We should\r\nmuster the will to face the political, economic, ecological\r\nand social challenges that stand in the way of the\r\nemancipation of the developing countries.\r\nAt the last session of the General Assembly the\r\nSecretary-General showed the way forward in his \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\", when he outlined his views on how the\r\nUnited Nations should carry out its task of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. He underscored the need\r\nfor an early warning system for crisis situations and the need\r\nfor timely preventive action, and he suggested peace-building\r\nmeasures that need to be taken. Uganda supported, and\r\ncontinues to support, the Secretary-General’s endeavour in\r\nthis area.\r\nIn our view, a critical pillar of conflict resolution, both\r\nat the international and the regional level, is the political will\r\nof the parties to the conflict and a commitment on their part\r\nto translate that will into practical actions. Where that will\r\nand commitment exist, solutions have been forthcoming,\r\neven to what were perceived as intractable problems.\r\nAnother critical element in this regard is the capacity to\r\nenforce solutions where agreements exist. When a group’s\r\nmajor consideration is military victory, contrary to the\r\nagreements reached, this may call for legitimate international\r\nintervention. I have in mind, for example, a number of\r\nagreements brokered between the parties by regional\r\norganizations or the United Nations which have then been\r\ndeliberately scuttled for no legitimate reason. The situations\r\nin Yugoslavia, Somalia, Liberia and Angola are vivid\r\nreminders of the need for such a capacity. It is untenable\r\nthat the international community should fail to act while\r\nsenseless loss of life is perpetuated or chaos obtains in a\r\ncountry, as was the case in Somalia and Liberia. As many\r\nspeakers have stated, sovereignty should not be used to hold\r\na population hostage. A capacity to intervene in such\r\nsituations should be in place. This is the question that we\r\nshould ponder in the course of our deliberations, with a view\r\nto establishing parameters for such eventualities.\r\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn our continent, Africa, the contradictory positive and\r\nnegative trends have also manifested themselves, both in the\r\npolitical arena and the economic sphere. In southern Africa,\r\nwe are on the verge of achieving the goal the international\r\ncommunity has always sought, namely, dismantling apartheid\r\nand putting in place a democratic and non-racial Government\r\nin South Africa. Here we have an example of political will\r\nand determination, and the capacity to translate that will into\r\nreality.\r\nUganda welcomes the progress made in South Africa\r\nand the decision to establish the Transitional Executive\r\nCouncil (TEC), the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC)\r\nand the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA). These\r\nare vital steps that should pave the way for free and fair\r\nelections next April, which should lead to the establishment\r\nof a transitional Government based on universal adult\r\nsuffrage. We salute Mr. Nelson Mandela and other leaders\r\nof the liberation movements and President de Klerk for their\r\nvision and statesmanship, which have made this progress\r\npossible.\r\nWith regard to the call to lift sanctions against South\r\nAfrica in response to this progress, Uganda’s approach has\r\nalways been guided by the position of the people of South\r\nAfrica, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the\r\nCommonwealth and the United Nations. We are therefore\r\nsupportive of the statement adopted on 29 September in New\r\nYork by the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa,\r\nwhich recommends the lifting of all economic sanctions,\r\nwith the exception of those relating to the arms embargo and\r\nnuclear matters, as recognition of the progress made thus far.\r\nWe also agree with the Ad Hoc Committee’s call for\r\nvigilance until the Transitional Executive Council is\r\nestablished and for the establishment of full diplomatic\r\nrelations following the installation of an elected interim\r\nGovernment of national unity.\r\nAs regards Mozambique, Uganda welcomed the signing\r\nof a peace accord between the Government of Mozambique\r\nand RENAMO on 4 October 1992. We had hoped that by\r\nnow all obstacles to the implementation of the accord would\r\nhave been settled. Addressing the Assembly on 27\r\nSeptember, President Chissano, outlined the progress made\r\nin the revival of the country’s economic and social activity\r\nas a consequence of a cease-fire being effectively honoured.\r\nThe deployment of the United Nations Operation in\r\nMozambique (ONUMOZ) provides an atmosphere conducive\r\nto implementing the provisions of the General Peace\r\nAgreement. We commend the Government of Mozambique\r\nfor the flexibility and statesmanship they have demonstrated.\r\nWe call on RENAMO to reciprocate equally and to comply\r\nwith Security Council resolution 863 (1993), so that the\r\npeople of Mozambique can embark on the important task of\r\nnational reconstruction in an atmosphere of peace and\r\nstability.\r\nUganda deeply regrets the resumption of hostilities in\r\nAngola, which clearly has negative consequences for the\r\nwhole region. Remarkable progress had been made,\r\nculminating in the United Nations-supervised elections last\r\nyear. Unfortunately, the hopes and aspirations of the people\r\nwere dashed by the resumption of hostilities which\r\ninterrupted the electoral process. The only way forward lies\r\nin national reconciliation and the acceptance of the rules of\r\ndemocratic governance. Uganda supports Security Council\r\nresolution 864 (1993), the implementation of which would\r\npave way for a lasting solution. It is incumbent upon\r\nUNITA to abide by this resolution.\r\nIn our own region Uganda welcomes the agreement\r\nbetween the two parties, the Rwandese Government and the\r\nRwandese Patriotic Front, on a process of national\r\nreconciliation and the installation of a broad-based\r\ntransitional government. Uganda, like other countries in the\r\nregion, is ready and willing to support the Rwandese people\r\nin their endeavour to find a lasting settlement of their\r\nproblems. This would also help foster stability and\r\ncooperation in our subregion. I wish to pay a tribute to\r\nPresident Ali Hassan Mwinyi and the Government of the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, to the Organization of African\r\nUnity, and to all those who have been helping the parties to\r\nreach this accord.\r\nThe United Nations has a critical role to play in the\r\nimplementation of the Rwanda agreements. Both parties to\r\nthe conflict requested the United Nations to provide a neutral\r\nforce. We are happy to see that this request has received\r\npositive consideration by the Security Council. The Council\r\nhas accepted the Secretary-General’s recommendation for the\r\nestablishment of a neutral force known as the United Nations\r\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). In the\r\nmeantime, Uganda has agreed to the deployment on the\r\nRwanda-Uganda border of the United Nations Observer\r\nMission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR) - as part and parcel\r\nof confidence-building measures - and stands ready to give\r\nadditional support as and when requested.\r\nThe conflict in southern Sudan continues to be of great\r\nconcern to, and a source of anguish for, us in Uganda. The\r\ncivil war has escalated rather than abated, resulting in loss\r\nof life, increased refugee flows, and the displacement of the\r\npopulation to neighbouring countries, Uganda included. We\r\nurge the parties to the conflict to cooperate in support of\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 31\r\nregional efforts designed to find a lasting solution. I wish\r\nalso to appeal to the international community to continue\r\nproviding humanitarian assistance and to be supportive of\r\nnegotiations for a peaceful settlement.\r\nThe situation in Somalia is a vivid example of both\r\nnatural and man-made disasters. Uganda welcomed the\r\ndecision of the Security Council in 1992 to provide\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the Somali people and to restore\r\norder in Somalia. The United Nations operations helped to\r\nend massive starvation and brought hope to the people of\r\nSomalia. Uganda is also supportive of the second United\r\nNations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II), whose\r\nmandate is to provide an appropriate atmosphere for\r\ncontinued humanitarian assistance and for reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation, and to facilitate an overall political settlement.\r\nWe were encouraged by the Addis Ababa agreement of\r\nMarch this year whereby various Somali political forces\r\nagreed upon a programme of disarmament and reconciliation.\r\nIt is sad that the situation in Somalia took a dramatic turn\r\nfor the worse with the killing of members of the United\r\nNations peace-keeping force. We regret the loss of life and\r\nattacks on the peace-keeping force. I wish to express our\r\nsincere condolences to the bereaved families and their\r\nrespective Governments. It remains our conviction that these\r\nincidents, reprehensible as they are, should not lead the\r\nUnited Nations to divert from, let alone abdicate, its\r\nresponsibilities towards the Somali people. Much has been\r\nachieved. Normalcy has been restored to much of the\r\ncountry, although chaos and armed resistance continue in a\r\nnumber of areas, especially in and around Mogadishu, where\r\nthey imperil international efforts. We call on Somali\r\npolitical leaders to cooperate with the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Drought and Development (IGADD), the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the United\r\nNations in efforts aimed at achieving peace and\r\nreconciliation and setting in motion transitional\r\narrangements, including the establishment of a broad-based\r\ngovernment. I wish to take this opportunity to commend\r\nUnited Nations personnel, the countries which have provided\r\nmaterial and financial support, and the volunteers who have\r\nrisked their lives in this worthy cause.\r\nAs regards the situation in Liberia, Uganda supports the\r\ninitiative of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) for the settlement of the crisis. We\r\nwelcomed the Cotonou Agreement signed on 25 July 1993,\r\nwhich provides for a cease-fire and for the transitional\r\narrangement leading to elections early next year. The\r\nECOWAS Miliary Observer Group (ECOMOG) has clearly\r\nbeen a stabilizing force in Liberia. That is why it has been\r\nentrusted with the supervision and implementation of the\r\nCotonou Agreement. We look forward to the full\r\nimplementation of this accord.\r\nAll this provides an example of the matching of the\r\npolitical will of the parties to the conflict to the capacity in\r\nthe region to implement the agreed settlement.\r\nEqually, the Security Council decision to make it easier\r\nfor the United Nations to supplement regional efforts in the\r\nsearch for agreements and in their implementation is most\r\nwelcome. Apart from enhancing the regional capacity for\r\npeace-keeping, the Security Council decision helps to\r\nengender confidence.\r\nAt the OAU Summit held in Cairo in July this year,\r\nAfrican States agreed to set up, within the OAU, a\r\nmechanism for conflict resolution. The positive\r\ndevelopments in Liberia and Rwanda, where the OAU and\r\nthe pertinent leaders in the subregion have effectively\r\ndischarged this role, are indicative of the potentialities of the\r\nregional mechanism.\r\nIn the Middle East, the mutual recognition between the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel, together\r\nwith the agreements signed between them, constitute a\r\nbreakthrough of historic proportions. This is yet another\r\nillustration of the dictum that where there is a will, vision\r\nand statesmanship, a way forward will be found. This\r\ndevelopment holds the promise for concord and cooperation\r\nin the Middle East region as a whole. We welcome the\r\nDeclaration of Principles on Palestinian interim self-rule in\r\nthe occupied territories. These arrangements, which\r\nenvisage a five-year transition period, are an important step\r\ntowards a comprehensive and lasting settlement in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\r\n338 (1973). We commend Chairman Arafat and Prime\r\nMinister Rabin for the courage and statesmanship they have\r\ndisplayed. We encourage all of them to persevere in the\r\ntask ahead and on the journey they have begun. I wish also\r\nto express Uganda’s appreciation to Norway, the United\r\nStates, the Russian Federation, and all those who were\r\ninstrumental in the reaching of this historic accord.\r\nThree years have elapsed since the outbreak of the Gulf\r\ncrisis. We are glad that the sovereignty of Kuwait was\r\nrestored. It remains our hope that, with positive\r\ndevelopments elsewhere in the region, it will be possible for\r\nthe people in the Gulf to be reconciled and to solve the\r\noutstanding problems so that harmony and cooperation can\r\nbe re-established. This requires, among other things,\r\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions relating to the\r\nGulf War settlement.\r\nUganda supports the efforts by the Secretary-General to\r\nensure an overall settlement of the Cyprus problem. Any\r\nsettlement, while taking into account the legitimate interests\r\nof the parties, should safeguard the sovereignty, unity and\r\nterritorial integrity of Cyprus.\r\nAs regards the Korean peninsula, Uganda supports the\r\naspiration of the Korean people to peaceful reunification.\r\nWe encourage them to continue their dialogue towards this\r\nobjective.\r\nIn Cambodia we have just witnessed the fruitful\r\ncompletion of the peace process in accordance with the Paris\r\nAgreements. Under the auspices of the United Nations\r\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) the\r\nCambodian people have been able to exercise their right to\r\nvote and to decide on their own Government in the general\r\nelections for a constituent assembly. We are happy to see\r\nthat a new democratic Constitution, with a constitutional\r\nmonarchy has been peacefully promulgated. I wish to\r\nexpress the gratitude of the Uganda delegation to the\r\nSecretary-General and the UNTAC personnel who, under the\r\nable leadership of Mr. Yasushi Akashi, the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, have contributed\r\ntowards a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian\r\nquestion. Our appreciation goes equally to Viet Nam,\r\nFrance, Australia, China, the United States of America and\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN),\r\nwhich, at different stages, contributed to the peace process.\r\nIt is to us a matter of deep regret that in the former\r\nYugoslavia, instability, strife and war based on ethnic and\r\nreligious differences continue unabated. In pursuit of the\r\nreprehensible notion of \"ethnic cleansing\", atrocities are\r\nbeing committed. In spite of the grave situation, it has not\r\nbeen possible for the Security Council and the international\r\ncommunity to act decisively to put an end to the agony and\r\nsuffering there. The injunctions of the Security Council\r\ncontinue to be flouted with impunity. We reject and\r\ncondemn the notion of \"ethnic cleansing\". I wish, however,\r\nto commend the United Nations Protection Force for the\r\nefforts it has made under the most difficult of conditions.\r\nOn disarmament, Uganda is encouraged by the progress\r\nachieved in the wake of the demise of the cold war. The\r\nUnited States and the Russian Federation under START II\r\nhave significantly reduced their nuclear arsenals. We were\r\nencouraged by the decision of the United States to extend\r\nthe moratorium on nuclear tests until 1994, by the\r\ndeclaration of Russia not to resume testing even if others\r\ndid, and by France’s commitment not to be the first to\r\nresume. In spite of the recent set-backs, we hope that this\r\nmoratorium will hold. Uganda, however, believes that a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is the ultimate\r\nsolution. As a State party to the non-proliferation Treaty,\r\nwe shall continue to participate actively in the preparatory\r\nprocess leading to the 1995 Review Conference. We support\r\nthe extension of the Treaty, subject to periodic reviews. We\r\nshall also seek to remove the imbalances in the present\r\nTreaty and to secure increased assistance for developing\r\ncountries in the area of the peaceful application of nuclear\r\nenergy.\r\nWe maintain that there exists an intrinsic relationship\r\nbetween the disarmament process and development.\r\nDeveloping countries paid a heavy price during the height of\r\nthe cold war as world attention was focused on acquiring\r\nadditional armaments under the doctrines of deterrence.\r\nMany of them were trapped in civil conflict arising from\r\nideological wars. As the resources devoted to building\r\narmaments are released in the disarmament process, these\r\nshould be applied for development both within and between\r\nnations. Unfortunately, at the international level, we have\r\nyet to see the peace dividend being channelled towards\r\nassistance to developing countries.\r\nAt the national level, Uganda, after the restoration of\r\npeace in the country, has now embarked on a process of\r\nscaling down its army to a level which the economy can\r\nsustain and which at the same time meets our legitimate\r\ndefence needs. This is a bold decision by the Government,\r\nwhich, in the long run, should release resources for\r\ndevelopment purposes. I wish here to express our\r\nappreciation to those countries and organizations which have\r\nagreed to assist us in the resettlement and integration of\r\ndemobilized soldiers within the civilian community.\r\nThis session is taking place in the aftermath of the\r\nmomentous World Conference on Human Rights that took\r\nplace in Vienna. That Conference reaffirmed the\r\ncommitment of the international community to try to secure\r\nthe full and universal enjoyment of human rights. We hope\r\nthat as a result there will be increased awareness in the\r\nworld of the importance of human rights and a determination\r\nto build the requisite capacity at the national and local levels\r\nto ensure their enforcement.\r\nLinked with the human rights issue is the question of\r\ndemocratic governance and the rule of law. Democratic\r\ngovernance promotes human rights. In Uganda, as part of\r\nthe restoration of democratic civilian rule, the Constitutional\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 33\r\nCommission has already produced a draft constitution. The\r\nelection of a Constituent Assembly, which is to deliberate\r\nand agree on the Constitution, will be held in December this\r\nyear or early next year.\r\nWhether in Africa or anywhere else, the\r\ndemocratization process may be difficult, but it is an\r\nessential ingredient for peace, stability, the rule of law, and\r\nthe full respect and enjoyment of human rights. This is\r\nparticularly urgent in developing countries, in Africa in\r\nparticular. They are essential aspects and conditions of the\r\ndevelopment process. We must therefore bring our full\r\nenergies to bear so that the democratization process may\r\ngain momentum.\r\nOne of the major objectives of the United Nations,\r\nenshrined in the Charter, is the promotion of economic and\r\nsocial progress. In our quest for peace, it is imperative to\r\naddress the economic and social challenges, which, too\r\noften, are the fundamental causes of conflicts in many\r\nregions.\r\nThe present world economic situation is very grim.\r\nThere has been a prolonged recession in the developed\r\ncountries which, in turn, has had a negative effect on the\r\nworld economic situation. This has been devastating for the\r\ndeveloping countries, which have had to labour in a harsh\r\ninternational environment. The crippling external debt is one\r\nof the major obstacles for developing countries. In Uganda,\r\nfor example, it is estimated that we shall spend about 60 per\r\ncent of our projected export receipts on debt servicing. The\r\ndebt problem has been exacerbated by the unfavourable\r\nterms of trade, especially the collapse of the prices of\r\ncommodities, which are the mainstay of our economies.\r\nCoupled with the reduction of resource flows, this has\r\nhampered our development. Yet, while still experiencing\r\nthese conditions, our countries have undertaken structural\r\nadjustment reforms which call for heavy sacrifices on the\r\npart of the population, especially the very vulnerable people.\r\nFor these programmes to achieve the desired objectives of\r\nsustained growth, it is imperative that further measures on\r\ndebt relief, including debt cancellation, be put in place, more\r\nso in respect of sub-Saharan African countries. There is also\r\nan urgent need to increase significantly the volume of\r\nresource flows in support of development efforts in these\r\ncountries. We look forward to the urgent and balanced\r\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations. We are hopeful that a successful conclusion of\r\nthese negotiations would increase world trade and increase\r\nthe access of our products to world markets. This should\r\nhelp to increase our export earnings.\r\nRegrettably, for Africa the critical economic situation\r\nand the trend of marginalization continue. It is crucial to\r\narrest and reverse this trend if Africa is to succeed or even\r\nsurvive in the geopolitical and economic system of the\r\ntwenty-first century. We need to enlarge our economic\r\nspace. Forging regional integration is an imperative if\r\nAfrica is to end its underdevelopment and to be integrated\r\ninto the global economy.\r\nAfrican integration will create economies of scale,\r\nwhich are essential for the diversification of the African\r\neconomies, making full use of Africa’s natural resources,\r\nincreasing self-sufficiency and strengthening the continent’s\r\nposition within the global economy. It is precisely for this\r\nreason that the Organization of African Unity adopted the\r\nAbuja Treaty creating an African Economic Community.\r\nThe Treaty stipulates, inter alia, the strengthening of\r\nsubregional economic groupings. In this regard, the\r\ncountries of the Eastern and Southern Africa Preferential\r\nTrade Area have resolved to establish a subregional common\r\nmarket. A treaty to this effect will be signed in Kampala,\r\nUganda, on 4 November this year. We appeal to the\r\ninternational community to be supportive of regional\r\nintegration by providing assistance to put in place the\r\nnecessary infrastructures.\r\nThe Rio Earth summit was an important milestone on\r\nthe road to forging a global consensus on sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Uganda welcomes the adoption of Agenda 21,\r\nwhich spelled out measures to be adopted by the\r\ninternational community. As a follow-up, Uganda has drawn\r\nup a National Environment Action Plan to address our\r\nenvironmental problems. We welcome the establishment of\r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development and of the\r\nNegotiating Committee for an international convention on\r\ndrought and desertification, in line with the wishes of\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nIn spite of the progress made, we notice a reluctance on\r\nthe part of the donor community as regards fulfilling the\r\ncommitments agreed upon in Rio. This is especially true\r\nwith regard to providing new and additional resources. I\r\nwish to stress that for us in Uganda the cause of\r\nenvironmental degradation is poverty. Forests, for example,\r\nare being depleted daily because the people use their trees as\r\na source of energy. To reverse this trend we need capital to\r\nexploit hydro-electric power or solar energy, both of which\r\nwe have aplenty. We urge the international community to\r\nappreciate this problem.\r\nAs regards reform of the United Nations, we maintain\r\nour position that we shall support those measures which\r\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nimprove efficiency and which do not distort the priorities\r\nthat have been agreed on, and which reflect the interests of\r\nall Member States. We are also supportive of the proposals\r\nfor the enlargement of the Security Council to reflect\r\npresent-day realities. We reaffirm that an important criterion\r\nto take into account is that a country, big or small, seeking\r\nmembership of the Security Council must fully embrace, and\r\nbe seen to act in accordance with, the underlying values of\r\nthe United Nations mandate for peace, respect for human\r\nrights, democratization and other accepted international\r\nnorms. It is also important that the composition of all\r\nUnited Nations organs accord with the principles of the\r\nCharter, notably the principle of sovereign equality of\r\nnations and the principle of democracy. It is with this in\r\nmind that we shall examine all proposals for restructuring\r\nthat are before us.\r\nWe stand at a historic watershed on account of\r\ncontradictory trends which characterize the current transition\r\nto a new world order yet to be shaped and defined. We\r\nhave, one hopes, a unique opportunity to construct a firm\r\nfoundation for the edifice of a future in which the interests\r\nof all of us can be adequately catered for.\r\nMr. ABU SALIH (Sudan): Allow me at the outset to\r\nexpress to Ambassador Insanally my special congratulations\r\non his election to preside over the General Assembly at this\r\nimportant session. He represents Guyana, an active member\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, of which Sudan is proud to\r\nbe a founding member. May I also extend our thanks and\r\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev for the\r\nskilful and efficient manner in which he conducted the work\r\nof the previous session.\r\nThe United Nations represents hope for all nations and\r\nnascent States, especially those that attained their\r\nindependence through long struggle. It is a great honour and\r\npleasure for me to welcome our sister country, Eritrea,\r\nwhich has joined the membership of the United Nations.\r\nOur two peoples continue to enjoy mutual respect and\r\nesteem, and our Governments are endeavouring to foster\r\nfraternal relations with a view to achieving prosperity for the\r\nbrotherly peoples of the two countries, and for the whole\r\nregion.\r\nAllow me also to salute the Czech Republic, Slovakia,\r\nThe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco and\r\nAndorra, which joined the United Nations as part of a new\r\nmomentum contributing to human endeavours to achieve\r\nstability, prosperity and peace for the world.\r\nI a l s o s a l u t e t h e S e c r e t a r y - G e n e r a l ,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is leading the Secretariat of\r\nthe United Nations at a crucial stage as it faces many\r\nchallenges and pressures.\r\nThe Sudan learned with grief and sadness of the tragic\r\nloss of life in the earthquake which struck parts of India. I\r\nextend the deepest sympathy of the Sudan to friendly India\r\nalong with heartfelt condolences to the families of those who\r\nlost their lives.\r\nSince the previous session, important events have\r\nemerged in the international arena. We are now witnessing\r\naccelerated political and social change unprecedented in\r\nhistory. New international situations and changes occur\r\nevery day; we are all trying to keep up with them. Today,\r\nwe are experiencing a phase of travail and transition, which\r\nresults every day in new, divergent patterns. The most\r\nstriking of those patterns is the widening of the gap between\r\nthe rich North and the less privileged South.\r\nThe trend in today’s world is towards the machinery of\r\nregional groupings. This reflects the fact that the world has\r\nalready started to be more inclined to think in a more\r\ncollective manner. We hope that this new pattern will be\r\npositive and constructive, giving due respect to the charters\r\nand covenants that are binding on all. We seriously assert\r\nthat developing countries are no longer principal partners in\r\nmost of the resolutions that are adopted, particularly within\r\nthe framework of the Security Council and other United\r\nNations organs. Had developing countries been allowed\r\nequitable participation, their contribution could have been\r\nmore effective in the course of many of these important\r\nevents, specially in the field of regional and international\r\npeace and security.\r\nFour years ago we started reviewing the functions of\r\nthe United Nations and its various organs. We must place\r\non record, from this rostrum, our conviction that this\r\nOrganization has a basic role to play in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and the achievement of\r\nprosperity for mankind. For the United Nations fully to\r\nperform such a vital role, its governing Charter must be fully\r\nrespected. The Charter must also be adhered to by all, and\r\nmust be updated to keep pace with the developments that\r\nhave occurred since its adoption.\r\nThe General Assembly too should be enabled fully to\r\nperform its functions for the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity. The General Assembly should be given its due\r\nimportance, equal and parallel to that of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 35\r\nSelectivity in implementing the provisions of the\r\nCharter must be abandoned. In this regard, we firmly stress\r\nthat the activities of the Security Council must be transparent\r\nand that the Council should adopt a democratic approach in\r\nits decisions. It is thus inevitable that the question of the\r\nCouncil’s permanent membership, and the right of veto,\r\nwhich enables a few States to invalidate the opinion of the\r\nmajority, be reviewed, especially at a time when the United\r\nNations is advocating the values of democracy, participation,\r\njustice and equality.\r\nThe United Nations and one of its organs, the Security\r\nCouncil, are currently engaged in serious and active attempts\r\nto settle disputes based on new prospects for the\r\nestablishment of regional and international peace and\r\nsecurity. Let us pause here for a moment. We all aspire to\r\nsave the world from the calamities of war and the\r\ndestructive consequences of the prevailing social and\r\neconomic situation. Yet, at the same time, we reject double\r\nstandards in the resolutions of the Security Council,\r\nespecially in relation to international peace and security. We\r\nare anxious lest the United Nations lose its proper vision in\r\nthe heat of events.\r\nThe nature of the responsibilities and duties of the\r\nOrganization requires strict neutrality. International peace\r\nand security is a principle that must apply to all. But to see\r\nthe people of Bosnia and Herzegovina suffer to the brink of\r\nelimination because of the shaky and defective resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council is a situation that should not be allowed\r\nto pass unnoticed. Similarly, the Somali people cannot be\r\nallowed to remain victims of irregularities committed by the\r\ninternational forces there because of the departure from their\r\nbinding original mandate. This is a matter that requires both\r\nchange and a strict and immediate investigation. We are still\r\nwitnessing the deterioration of the security situation in\r\nSomalia owing to the continuing fighting between the\r\ninternational forces and some of the Somali factions, as well\r\nas with individuals. This has resulted in many killings and\r\nhas caused the international forces to stray from their\r\noriginal mandate. We have previously expressed our\r\nreservations with regard to the hasty use of international\r\nforces in Somalia without consulting the States of the region\r\nor exhausting the efforts and endeavours being exerted by\r\nthose States to find a solution to the Somali crisis.\r\nWe are concerned that the continuation of fighting\r\nbetween the international forces and some of the Somali\r\nfactions will shed more blood, complicate the problem and\r\nrender it insoluble by the United Nations. Therefore, we\r\nrequest the United Nations and the forces that are supposed\r\nto operate under its banner to refrain from continuing the\r\ntype of actions that would provoke the Somali people and\r\nthe country’s factions or affect the structure of their political\r\nfuture, values and cultural and religious heritage.\r\nWe also deem it fitting that the Permanent Committee\r\non Somalia of the States of The Horn of Africa be given the\r\nnecessary time to perform its pioneering function of finding\r\na solution to the Somali crisis. These States are better\r\nacquainted with the nature and dimension of the problem by\r\nvirtue of their special relations with Somalia and its people.\r\nWe will support new international arrangements that\r\nwill ensure the enhancement of the performance of the\r\nOrganization and establish justice and tranquillity among all.\r\nThe arrangements we are hoping for shall not infringe upon\r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States or meddle\r\nwith their independence or right of decision-making.\r\nPreventive diplomacy, associated with peacemaking and\r\npeace-keeping, should be motivated by a basic goal, namely,\r\nthe elimination of regional and international tension. This\r\ncould be achieved by defining the causes of political and\r\nsocial conflicts in order to eliminate them so that different\r\nsocieties might enjoy stability, well-being, and peace.\r\nPreventive diplomacy and the subsequent use of political and\r\nmilitary force cannot be applied solely against less privileged\r\ncountries and vulnerable peoples.\r\nIn brief, we are hoping for a new formula within the\r\nframework of current international arrangements to guarantee\r\nthe rights of all and to save the world from the hegemony of\r\nthe stronger over the less privileged. We also aspire to a\r\ngreater role for the regional organizations of the developing\r\ncountries and to their representation in the important forum\r\nof the Security Council, which is entrusted with the task of\r\nmaintaining peace and security all over the world.\r\nAlong with this understanding of the new role of the\r\nUnited Nations in protecting and preserving the rights of\r\nStates, we call for the lifting of the economic embargo\r\nimposed on Iraq. The Iraqi people have suffered for an\r\nextended period of time from the unfair embargo that is still\r\nimposed on them, despite the exhaustion of the reasons that\r\ninvoked it.\r\nAnother example of the misuse of this international\r\nOrganization is the embargo imposed on Libya without any\r\nlegal and justified cause to permit the actions taken against\r\nthat country. Libya has already responded to Security\r\nCouncil resolution 731 (1992) and shown sufficient\r\nflexibility to settle its differences with the Western States, a\r\nmatter that would justify the lifting of the embargo imposed\r\non it.\r\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe agenda items before this session include important\r\nissues reflecting the accelerated pace of events I mentioned\r\nat the beginning of my statement. However, I prefer to be\r\ndirect in touching upon issues of immediate concern to us in\r\nthe Sudan because of the misunderstanding that has\r\naccompanied them.\r\nDuring the forty-eighth session of the Human Rights\r\nCommission, held at Geneva in March 1992, and upon a\r\nmotion by the United States representative, the Commission\r\nadopted a resolution appointing an independent expert\r\nassigned to investigate the human-rights situation in the\r\nSudan and to submit a report to the forty-ninth session of the\r\nCommission in March-April 1993. The States sponsoring\r\nthat resolution did not wish to wait for the report of the\r\nindependent expert but pushed the matter to the forty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly, where a resolution on the\r\nalleged human-rights violations in the Sudan was adopted.\r\nThe sponsoring States used all the influence, pressure and\r\nthe mechanical majority they possessed to see that that\r\npolitically motivated resolution was adopted.\r\nIn his report to the forty-ninth session of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights in March 1993, the\r\nindependent expert praised the cooperation of the\r\nGovernment of the Sudan and explained that he had had\r\nneither the time nor the opportunity to judge the situation of\r\nhuman rights in the Sudan or to study the matter\r\ncomprehensively. He indicated that the Commission might\r\nwish to extend his mission in order to allow him to complete\r\nhis mandate. While we do not conceive of any justifiable\r\nreasons behind his appointment, the Government of the\r\nSudan nevertheless extended every possible cooperation to\r\nthe Special Rapporteur, who visited the Sudan last week and\r\nwill submit his report.\r\nRespect for and maintenance of human rights represent\r\none of the sacred principles that are enshrined in all divine\r\nreligions as well as in man-made laws. The Sudan, inspired\r\nby its cultural and civilized heritage, pays due attention to\r\nthe issues of human rights. The Sudanese Government and\r\nsociety respect and observe the human-rights values based\r\non their religious belief and traditions. Accordingly, we\r\nreject any politicization or manipulation of such a sacred\r\ndoctrine as a pretext for meddling in the internal affairs of\r\nStates or for imposing a specific cultural trend or option of\r\ncivilization on any State. For the same reason, we are of the\r\nview that developmental assistance should not be tied to a\r\ndistorted human-rights record. The right to development\r\nitself represents an inalienable human right. We also opt for\r\nequality and fairness in assessing or monitoring the\r\nperformance of States in the field of human rights. We\r\nadamantly reject policies that reflect a double standard in\r\ndealing with human rights, because the Sudan has been\r\nvictimized by such policies. We also hope that universality\r\nof human rights will not be construed to justify denial of the\r\ncultural, religious and indigenous specifics of various States\r\nand peoples.\r\nThose who pose as defenders of human rights in the\r\nSudan ignore the terrorist practices of the outlaws in\r\nsouthern Sudan lead by John Garang. They have opted to\r\nkeep silent with respect to the atrocities he has committed,\r\natrocities such as the abduction and recruitment of children\r\nfor military operations, the regular killing of civilian\r\npopulations, the downing of civilian aircraft and the\r\nkidnapping and killing of United Nations staff working in\r\nrelief operations. They have also kept silent with regard to\r\nhis continued obstruction of all serious peacemaking\r\nendeavours initiated inside or outside the Sudan. Not only\r\nthat, they have received him as a top official dignitary and\r\nextended to him every moral support, despite his gross\r\nviolation of human rights.\r\nIn this connection we view General Assembly\r\nresolution 47/142 as a biased resolution that has contributed\r\nto the intransigence of the Garang movement and motivated\r\nit to reject all Government endeavours to achieve a peaceful\r\nsettlement through negotiations. We are also convinced that\r\nthat resolution lacks any substantive justification, and we\r\nstand ready to provide all the factual information on the\r\nhuman-rights situation in the Sudan to all who are interested.\r\nThose who accuse the Government of the Sudan of\r\nviolating the human rights of its own citizens have also\r\nignored the giant achievements of the Government, such as\r\nadopting the conferences system along the lines of Shura\r\nand organizing the national conferences to determine the\r\nstructure of the political system in order to lay down the\r\nbasic foundations of national unity and to look for ways and\r\nmeans to achieve a real peace guaranteeing fundamental\r\npolitical, social, cultural and religious rights for all citizens.\r\nAs a result, a National Transitional Assembly was\r\nestablished as the supreme legislative organ of the country,\r\npending completion of the political structures at both the\r\nfederal and the state level and the conduct of the presidential\r\nelections to be held in the country at a subsequent stage.\r\nMany must have learned of the recent decision of the\r\nUnited States Government to add the Sudan to its own\r\nclassification of countries allegedly sponsoring terrorism.\r\nWhile the United States Government is free to take whatever\r\ndecision it deems appropriate, we have the right to question\r\nthe facts and findings on which the United States\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 37\r\nGovernment has based its decision. While the United States\r\nhas the right to enact domestic decisions, the utilization of\r\nsuch decisions as a prelude to further actions beyond its\r\nterritories contradicts international law and the United\r\nNations Charter. We cannot understand how a super-Power\r\nwhich enjoys permanent membership in the Security Council\r\ncan enact domestic legislation to justify the pursuit of its\r\nprivate interests in the territories of other countries. Such\r\ninstances are numerous, the most recent of which was the\r\nsearch in the port of Djibouti of a vessel freighting sugar en\r\nroute to sisterly Somalia.\r\nIt is our conviction that the motive behind the media\r\ncampaign against the Sudan is the alienation of Sudan from\r\nits African and Arab affiliations and the smearing of its\r\nimage by erroneously labelling its civilization as terrorist.\r\nThis media campaign constitutes a prelude to a siege on\r\nSudan similar to what has happened to some other countries.\r\nWe are known to all as a peaceful nation; we denounce\r\nterrorism in all its forms. Accordingly, the decision lacks the\r\nnecessary legal support, contravenes justice and good\r\nconscience and clearly exceeds the role of the United\r\nNations. As proof of our assertion, it could not generate any\r\nsupport. Former President Jimmy Carter and a number of\r\ncredible institutions and newspapers have expressed their\r\nscepticism and criticism regarding its ethical value.\r\nLikewise, the Sudanese peoples have demonstrated their\r\nrejection and denunciation of that decision. Real terrorism\r\nis when a single super-Power uses it as a pretext and utilizes\r\nits might to terrorize small developing countries for no\r\nreason except that they opted for a path of independent\r\ndecision-making and rejected blind proselytism, or merely\r\nfor their different views.\r\nMixing politics with humanitarian assistance is rather\r\nrisky, especially in relief work, which is a sensitive matter,\r\nas it directly affects human survival through supplying basic\r\nneeds such as food and medicine. This necessitates the\r\nabsolute neutrality of the relief donors. Recent years have\r\nwitnessed an increasing involvement of politics in\r\nhumanitarian work, which fact led Mr. Cornelio Sommaruga,\r\nPresident of the International Committee of the Red Cross\r\n(ICRC) to explicitly warn against the danger of mixing\r\npolitics with humanitarian work. Sudan has suffered\r\ntremendously from these attempts to tarnish its image by\r\nintentionally distorting its achievements in relief delivery so\r\nthat they are seen as failures, its initiatives depicted as\r\nobstructions and its cooperation as impediment of the inflow\r\nof relief supplies. The reality is that we feel we are unjustly\r\ntreated by some States and some media that tend to\r\nundermine our efforts in relief operation and blemish our\r\nreputation.\r\nHowever, Sudan has a bright and outstanding record in\r\nthis area. Operation Lifeline Sudan is an unprecedented\r\ninitiative; it has enabled the United Nations and\r\nnon-governmental organizations to provide relief supplies to\r\naffected populations, whoever and wherever they are. Since\r\nthe forty-seventh session, continuous efforts have been made\r\nto strengthen the efficiency of Operation Lifeline and its\r\nrelief programme, such as the signing of an agreement\r\nbetween the Government of the Sudan, the United Nations\r\nand the rebel factions in December 1992 to secure the flow\r\nof relief to all areas in need. In January 1993, another\r\nagreement was signed between the Government of the\r\nSudan, the United Nations and the non-governmental\r\norganizations to facilitate and enhance the role of the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in relief and rehabilitation. In\r\nMarch 1993, the Government of the Sudan signed a\r\nmemorandum of understanding with the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross to streamline the cooperation\r\nbetween the Government and the Committee and to\r\nstrengthen the effectiveness of its operations in southern\r\nSudan. The allocation of 153,000 metric tons of grain by\r\nthe Government to the World Food Programme to be\r\ndistributed to the population in need represents a cornerstone\r\nof our contribution to relief efforts.\r\nThe mission of Mr. Vieri Traxler, Special Envoy of the\r\nSecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs for the Sudan,\r\nand its positive outcome, stand as another example of the\r\ncooperation of the Government of the Sudan with the\r\ninternational community. A number of modalities were\r\nagreed upon during that mission to guarantee the full\r\nimplementation of all previously signed agreements. It is\r\nmy pleasure to convey to this Assembly that during Mr.\r\nTraxler’s mission to the Sudan a number of steps were taken\r\nto implement what was agreed upon. On the initiative of the\r\nGovernment of the Sudan, an agreement was reached to send\r\njoint assessment missions, constituted by the United Nations\r\nand the non-governmental organizations working in relief\r\noperations, to about 30 safe locations in the three Southern\r\nStates, the Nuba mountains and Kordofan. It was also\r\nagreed that the town of Malakal and its environs would be\r\nconsidered a model of relief integrated programmes to be\r\nimplemented in other areas after proving successful. This is\r\nin addition to other steps oriented towards strengthening the\r\nefficiency of operations and ensuring relief for those in\r\nneed wherever they may be.\r\nAllow me to acquaint this Assembly with the\r\nachievements of the Government of Sudan in political,\r\neconomic and social fields. The priority item on my\r\nGovernment’s agenda is to attain a just and lasting peace in\r\nsouthern Sudan and to put an end to the war that horrified\r\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ninnocent civilians and devastated their lives, the war that\r\nexposed them to the scourges of death, famine, disease and\r\ndisplacement. This war, which was the by-product of the\r\ncolonial conspiracy, has turned the citizens into recipients of\r\nrelief and made them dependent on others. It constitutes a\r\nperpetual squandering of vast resources that could have been\r\nutilized in economic and social development and for the\r\nwelfare of the Sudanese peoples in the south and the north.\r\nFaithful to its earnest endeavours to bring about a\r\npeaceful settlement of the discord in the south, the Sudanese\r\nGovernment has emphasized since 1989 its readiness to talk\r\npeace with the rebels without preconditions. The\r\nGovernment put forward a comprehensive framework for\r\npeace emanating from the recommendations of a national\r\nconference. This approach is based on remedying the\r\nlingering causes of the conflict in the areas of power- and\r\nwealth-sharing, relations between religion and State, adoption\r\nof the federal system of government to meet the aspirations\r\nof different regions for a genuine sharing of power, the\r\nexemption of the south from the application of Sharia laws\r\nand the redistribution and reallocation of resources for social\r\nand economic development on equitable grounds.\r\nIn this positive spirit the Government held several\r\nrounds of negotiations with the rebel movement. The last\r\nmeeting took place in Abuja with the mediation of sisterly\r\nNigeria. The Government, out of its keen desire to bring the\r\npeace talks to a successful conclusion, showed great\r\nflexibility, but it realized, unfortunately, that, owing to the\r\npressures of foreign interests, Garang’s faction was not the\r\nmaster of its decision. That was why we could not reach an\r\nagreement in order to alleviate the suffering of our citizens\r\nin the south.\r\nThe failure of the second Abuja peace talks did not,\r\nhowever, weaken the determination of the Government to\r\ncontinue searching for peace through negotiations. To this\r\nend, the Government started a new round of negotiations,\r\nthis time in Sudanese territory, with the other united rebel\r\nfactions. The Government also accepted a quadrilateral\r\npeace initiative put forward by four Heads of State members\r\nof the Intergovernmental Authority for Drought and\r\nDevelopment (IGADD): Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea. We believe that neighbouring countries are able and\r\nkeen to help in resolving this stalemate. Furthermore, the\r\nGovernment accepted the initiative of former President\r\nJimmy Carter in mediating between the Government and the\r\nrebel factions.\r\nIn the area of economic development, the Government\r\nof the Sudan adopted an ambitious three-year economic\r\nprogramme for the implementation of far-reaching reforms\r\nin the structure of the Sudanese economy by engaging in a\r\nfree-market policy, diminishing the role of the Government\r\nin trade and economic activities, and giving the private\r\nsector its due catalytic role in these activities.\r\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 39\r\nEconomic and monetary regulations were enacted to\r\nencourage investment, especially in agriculture and animal\r\nproducts. This economic programme reaped its fruits, and\r\nwe have registered an increase of over 10 per cent in the\r\nrate of growth of the gross national product, as well as self-\r\nsufficiency in grain and sugar. This programme energized\r\nthe economy and led to the inflow of foreign investment,\r\nowing to the free-market policy, the reform of the\r\ninfrastructure and the building up of the capacity of human\r\nresources.\r\nAll these developments could have achieved positive\r\nresults, not for the benefit of the Sudanese people alone, but\r\nalso for the African and Arab regions, had they not been\r\nforestalled by political machinations in areas of international\r\ntrade and economic cooperation, as well as interference in\r\nthe work of the international monetary institutions. An\r\nunjust and undeclared economic embargo deprived the Sudan\r\nof development resources from bilateral and multilateral\r\ninstitutions. This unjust behaviour deprived the people of\r\nthe Sudan of their right to development, a right enshrined in\r\nall international conventions.\r\nIn the social field, the Government is very attentive to\r\nthe needs of the impoverished sector of the population.\r\nFinancial support is increasingly extended to them through\r\nZakat funds and social-welfare institutions. A number of\r\ncommercial subsidies were introduced to alleviate the\r\neconomic burden of a broad sector of the population.\r\nSalaries in the public and private sectors were increased and\r\nsubjected to continuous revision. All this was done in full\r\ncompliance with and respect for human dignity, and to\r\neliminate poverty.\r\nMoreover, in the area of legislation, the Government\r\nexcluded the States with non-Muslim majorities from being\r\nsubjected to Sharia laws.\r\nIn the area of human rights, a Supreme Council for\r\nHuman Rights was established, under the chairmanship of\r\nthe second-highest ranking official in the State.\r\nSecurity prevails throughout the country, the rule of law\r\nhas replaced chaos, and there have been other great\r\naccomplishments in the fields of education, literacy, health,\r\nenvironment, and the improvement of the living conditions\r\nof displaced persons and their relocation to ensure a\r\ndignified life while they await the elimination of the\r\nconditions that forced them to become displaced persons.\r\nThe position of Sudan has remained clear ever since the\r\ncommencement of the Arab-Israeli peace talks: we believe\r\nthat they should lead to the exercise of Arab and Palestinian\r\nrights based on the provisions of Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978). Since\r\nthe signing of the Declaration of Principles of self-autonomy\r\nbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and\r\nIsrael, the Middle East and the Palestinians’ cause have\r\nentered a new phase. The Arab League Council of\r\nMinisters, after its 100th meeting in Cairo, issued a\r\ncommuniqué on this agreement based on Security Council\r\nresolutions. The communiqué emphasized the necessity of\r\nan Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories\r\nin the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, the Golan\r\nHeights and southern Lebanon so as to open a new page in\r\nthe history of the Middle East and enable the people of the\r\nregion to work for development and prosperity. The Arab\r\nLeague Council considered the agreement a step forward\r\ntowards the establishment of a comprehensive peace in the\r\nregion, provided that other steps to complement it were\r\nguaranteed such as a complete Israeli withdrawal from the\r\noccupied Syrian Golan Heights, the West Bank, including\r\nJerusalem, and the territory in southern Lebanon.\r\nThe Arab world has articulated its judgement on this\r\nhistoric agreement and proved its sincerity about desiring a\r\njust, lasting and comprehensive settlement in the region. At\r\nthis critical point in time, we appeal to our Palestinian\r\nbrothers to consolidate their unity and unify their\r\ndeterminant objectives. They should close the doors against\r\nany attempts to divide them. The United Nations is called\r\nupon to supervise this peace plan by insisting on the\r\nimplementation of all its resolutions based on international\r\nlegitimacy. The custodians of this peace plan are also called\r\nupon to ensure an expeditious Israeli withdrawal from all the\r\noccupied Arab and Palestinian territories, in full compliance\r\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nThe positive developments taking place in South Africa\r\nas a result of the struggle of our brothers and sisters there in\r\ntheir quest for emancipation, equality and the rule of the\r\nmajority stand as proof of the important role the United\r\nNations can play in accordance with the principles of the\r\nCharter whenever a Member State shows the necessary\r\npolitical will. My delegation associates itself with the leader\r\nNelson Mandela in his call upon the international\r\nOrganization to secure the transitional arrangements leading\r\nto the emergence of a democratic, unified and non-racial\r\nSouth Africa.\r\nAs an African country, we believe that Africa has\r\ndemonstrated throughout history its unique ability to resolve\r\nAfrican disputes through African mediation. In this regard,\r\nI salute the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the\r\n40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Drought and Desertification\r\n(IGADD), the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and all other African subregional organizations,\r\nas well as various African States that have played leading\r\nroles in the peaceful settlement of several disputes in such\r\ncountries as Rwanda and Liberia,\r\nthus contributing to peace and stability in Africa. We hope\r\nthat peace will soon prevail in Angola, Mozambique and\r\nSomalia so that Africa can enjoy the stability that will enable\r\nit to meet the challenges of construction and development\r\nand move towards prosperity for the African people and\r\npeople of the whole world.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.10 p.m.\r\n"
