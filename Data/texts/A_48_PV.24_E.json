"yUnited Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n24th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nMonday, 11 October 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Yoo (Republic of\r\nKorea), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. KAPUTIN (Papua New Guinea): On behalf of the\r\npeople and Government of Papua New Guinea, I should like\r\nto congratulate Ambassador Insanally of Guyana on his\r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session. In so doing, I should like to recall - and to\r\nexpress my delegation’s sincere appreciation for - the even-\r\nhanded and efficient manner in which his predecessor, Mr.\r\nStoyan Ganev, the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria, presided\r\nover the Assembly at its forty-seventh session.\r\nHis outstanding example has maintained and thereby\r\nhelped to strengthen a high standard which we are confident\r\nMr. Insanally will match. His election brings us particular\r\npleasure because of the many important interests which\r\nGuyana shares with Papua New Guinea and the increasingly\r\nstrong relations which have been developing between our\r\ntwo countries, mainly through cooperation in the context of\r\nmultilateral organizations such as the Commonwealth, the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific group of Governments parties\r\nto the Lomé Convention, and the United Nations itself.\r\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea is also pleased\r\nto welcome the further progress towards the universal\r\nmembership of the United Nations marked by the admission\r\nof the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Eritrea, The\r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco and\r\nAndorra. We look forward to cooperating with their\r\nGovernments and delegations in advancing the objectives of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIn welcoming the new Members, I feel bound to\r\nobserve that my Government is concerned that other small\r\nStates, including a number in the South Pacific, which find\r\nit difficult to afford to join and send missions to the United\r\nNations, should be provided with the means of keeping\r\nabreast of developments and of having proper account taken\r\nof their interests, perhaps through such arrangements as a\r\nregional observer, as a number of Governments have\r\nproposed to the South Pacific Forum.\r\nI turn now to the proposed United Nations initiative on\r\nopportunity and participation. When I addressed the General\r\nAssembly 12 months ago, I said that I had chosen\r\n\"opportunity and participation\" as the main theme and goal\r\nof my policy as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I also forecast\r\nthat my Government would be formally proposing an\r\ninitiative for the United Nations bearing the same name.\r\nThe proposal is now listed as item 151 on the agenda\r\nof the current session of the General Assembly. The\r\ninitiative is, of course, important for Papua New Guinea -\r\nopportunity and participation are, in fact, among the national\r\ngoals and directive principles embodied in our national\r\nConstitution. It is also important to other developing\r\ncountries where increasing opportunity for, and participation\r\nby, citizens is a public issue and an official aim. It is,\r\nmoreover, directly relevant to countries where previous\r\neconomic arrangements are in transition to markets. In an\r\nincreasingly interdependent world, where issues and ideas\r\noften have global implications, it should be of interest and\r\ncertainly deserves support worldwide.\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86813 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.24\r\n1 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nPapua New Guinea became independent on the very\r\nsame day, 16 September 1975, as the General Assembly\r\nadopted a consensus resolution - 3362 (S-VII), on\r\n\"Development and international economic co-operation\" -\r\ndirected, in the words of its first preambular paragraph, \"to\r\naccelerate the development of developing countries\". The\r\ntiming was, almost certainly, coincidental. But it is none the\r\nless worthy of notice because of what it suggests about the\r\ncircumstances, including a continuing need to achieve the\r\nsame aim on the part of countries such as Papua New\r\nGuinea both then and now.\r\nIn the early l990s, Papua New Guinea has been\r\nenjoying an unprecedented rate of economic growth,\r\nmeasured, in the standard terms employed by bodies such as\r\nthe World Bank, at something more than 9 per cent per year.\r\nBut few would suggest that the living standards of most of\r\nour people have improved at anything like the same rate.\r\nThe measure is quite seriously misleading, as many of us\r\nhave known for a very long time. But so are government\r\npolicies and processes of economic development that fail to\r\npay adequate attention to questions of distribution, including\r\nwho benefits and who takes part. I refer here, I should add,\r\nto distribution not only of Government services but of\r\nopenings - and even more to effective access - for people to\r\nbenefit by taking part in economic development.\r\nIn certain sectors of society in many countries,\r\nincluding my own, people - particularly those living in rural\r\nareas - are still trying to enter the cash economy for the first\r\ntime. In other sectors and even more countries, people who\r\nhave long been engaged in monetary transactions are trying\r\nto increase openings, access and mutually beneficial\r\ninteractions. Increasing opportunity and participation is, in\r\nmany respects, a universal goal. The urgency of the need to\r\naddress the means of achieving it comprehensively,\r\nsystematically, thoroughly and critically now arises out of\r\nconcern at several features of the current international\r\nsituation.\r\nThe first is the difficult and often worsening\r\ncircumstances of and in many developing countries. A\r\nsecond is the problems being encountered in the transition to\r\nmarkets in countries where economic arrangements were\r\npreviously State-centred. Another feature results from a\r\ntendency among economic policy-makers in widely scattered\r\nparts of the world, including developed countries and the\r\nmajor international financial institutions, during the 1980s to\r\nfavour reducing the economic role of the State and to leave\r\nquestions of access and distribution of benefits to markets.\r\nComplicating the effects of so-called \"aid fatigue\" in\r\ndeveloped countries are the increasing need and demand for\r\naid, investment and commercial loans arising from the\r\nchanges occurring in Eastern and Central Europe, the former\r\nSoviet Union, southern Africa and the Middle East. New\r\nopportunities for scarce capital and other resources are also\r\nopening up in the same and other areas. Furthermore,\r\nexpensive and urgent needs will have to be met when the\r\nterrible conflicts currently raging in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nthe Caucasus, parts of Africa and elsewhere are resolved and\r\nrehabilitation can get under way.\r\nIn other words, resumption or continuation of\r\ndevelopment in many parts of the world will require that\r\nmore must be done with less. Opportunity, access and\r\nbeneficial participation in economic development must be\r\nquite dramatically increased if living conditions are to be\r\nmaintained, let alone improved.\r\nThe proposal which the Papua New Guinea Government\r\nis therefore making is for the United Nations to establish a\r\nsmall panel of distinguished, expert and experienced persons\r\nbroadly representative of the international community to\r\nreview what has already been done and to identify options\r\nto increase opportunity and participation, with particular,\r\nthough not exclusive, reference to the economies of\r\ndeveloping countries. We propose not an academic study,\r\nbut one that draws on actual experience and makes\r\nrecommendations for practical action. We do not have any\r\nfixed ideas about what it should say. Rather, we want it to\r\nmake a close, critical examination of what has been\r\nattempted, what has been proposed and what has been - for\r\nwhatever reason, or for none - overlooked.\r\nWe emphatically do not want the project to begin with\r\ndoctrinaire assumptions; rather, we want it to ask questions -\r\nfor example, about when and how it is best for the State to\r\nlimit its involvement in the economy or to withdraw\r\ncompletely, and when and how the State should act to\r\nmaximize opportunity and participation. Above all, we want\r\nit to investigate and to provide advice on the best way of\r\nlinking opportunity, via effective access, to participation.\r\nThus, the panel, the project and the report ought to be\r\nmultidisciplinary in approach and scope, examining critically\r\nboth experiences and ideas about ways in which legal,\r\nadministrative, economic, social and other arrangements help\r\nor hinder increasing economic opportunity and participation.\r\nWhile the focus should be on the particular difficulties\r\nof developing countries, the project should, we believe, look\r\nfurther afield. It will, in fact, have to do so if its research\r\nand findings are to stimulate the world-wide information\r\nexchange, and, above all make the practical difference which\r\nwe hope will result.\r\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 3\r\nIn my statement to the General Assembly a year ago I\r\ndescribed the proposed United Nations initiative on\r\nopportunity and participation as being in some respects \"the\r\neconomic counterpart\" to the Secretary-General’s most\r\nsuccinct and constructive report, \"An Agenda for Peace.\" It\r\nshould also be seen, I believe, as a complement to, and a\r\nnecessary filling-out of, other important United Nations\r\nresolutions and documents that have been concerned with\r\ndevelopment issues more generally, such as the reports of\r\nthe Pearson and Brandt Commissions, and \"The Challenge\r\nto the South\".\r\nThe panel and the report envisaged in our proposed\r\ndraft resolution should, in addition, be viewed as\r\ncomplementing and helping to fill out the Brundtland Report,\r\nparticularly in so far as they manage to identify options not\r\nonly for maintaining increased opportunity and participation,\r\nbut for continuing to increase them so as to allow living\r\nstandards to go on being raised for and by future\r\ngenerations.\r\nWhile we await publication of the Secretary-General’s\r\neagerly anticipated report outlining an agenda for\r\ndevelopment, the proposed initiative on opportunity and\r\nparticipation should not be seen as a rival or a duplication.\r\nThe proposal ought to be seen instead for what it is intended\r\nto be, namely, a constructive start and a practical\r\ncontribution to setting objectives and specifying means for\r\ndevelopment into the twenty-first century.\r\nLike other supporters of the proposal, the Government\r\nof Papua New Guinea has been gratified by the strong and\r\npositive response with which the proposed United Nations\r\ninitiative on opportunity and participation has been greeted\r\nby Governments, non-governmental organizations and\r\ninternational bodies in diverse parts of the world.\r\nWe have particularly appreciated the expressions of\r\nsupport we have received from the Government of the\r\nAssembly’s President, the Chairman of the General\r\nAssembly’s Second Committee, and organizations\r\nparticularly concerned with advancing the common interests\r\nof developing countries, the Group of 77 and the Movement\r\nof Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nIn our own immediate neighbourhood, we have been\r\nassured of strong, individual and collective support by\r\nmembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), the Melanesian Spearhead Group, and the South\r\nPacific Forum, which includes the Governments of\r\ndeveloped countries in the region.\r\nWith assistance from the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, my Government has convened both a national\r\nand a regional Workshop, in which highly respected,\r\nvariously experienced and diversely skilled persons gave\r\ntheir time on an honorary basis to help develop and refine\r\nthe proposal. The proceedings of both Workshops are being\r\ncirculated to all United Nations members.\r\nWhen the proposal is debated in the Assembly on 15\r\nNovember, we look to all members of the United Nations for\r\ncontributions to its further development and refinement, and,\r\nof course, for their votes. As it did with the resolution\r\n(47/441) on development and international economic\r\ncooperation, adopted on Papua New Guinea’s independence\r\nday, my Government hopes that the General Assembly will\r\nendorse the proposed United Nations initiative on\r\nopportunity and participation by consensus.\r\nBelieving as we do in the importance of the proposed\r\ninitiative, but conscious of the severe strains currently\r\nimposed on the United Nations human and financial\r\nresources, and bearing in mind the recommendation made to\r\nall members by the Second Ministerial Meeting of the\r\nStanding Committee on Economic Cooperation of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, my Government has decided to\r\nmake a special pledge to contribute K100,000 - the\r\nequivalent of a little more than $102,000 - to assist in\r\nrealizing the proposal. While we believe that\r\nimplementation of the proposal must not depend on special\r\ndonations, we call upon others to do the same in accordance\r\nwith their means.\r\nWith regard to conferences on development and related\r\nissues, consistent with Papua New Guinea’s obvious interest\r\nin development issues generally, and in those that pertain to\r\nsmall island countries in particular, my Government looks\r\nforward to the first Global Conference on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, which is to\r\nbe held in Barbados in April 1994.\r\nWe shall remain actively involved in preparations for,\r\nand the proceedings of, what we regard as a most important\r\noccasion for sharing experiences and ideas, including both\r\nproblems and hopes, with island States in our own and other\r\nregions.\r\nFor closely related reasons, we also look forward to the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development, to\r\nbe held in Cairo in 1994.\r\nHaving taken a close interest in the deliberations and\r\noutcome of the World Conference on Human Rights in\r\nVienna in June, we shall contribute as best we can to the\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\npreparations for the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nto be held in Copenhagen, and the Fourth World Conference\r\non Women, scheduled for Beijing, both in 1995.\r\nI turn to the subject of apartheid and sanctions against\r\nSouth Africa. Successive Governments of Papua New\r\nGuinea have always been strongly opposed to apartheid, both\r\nin principle and in practice. We have consistently applied\r\nsanctions, backed by the force of Papua New Guinea law,\r\nagainst those who have upheld it. Even as apartheid has\r\nbeen dismantled, and progress towards a democratic,\r\nmulti-racial South Africa has been observed, my Government\r\nhas been conscious of the special perspectives and interests\r\nof African States. We have accordingly taken the view that\r\nwe would remove our sanctions against South Africa only in\r\nconsultation, conducted through bodies such as the\r\nCommonwealth and the United Nations, with such States.\r\nDespite the economic interests which might have been\r\nserved by allowing links between Papua New Guinea and\r\nSouth Africa, we have willingly paid the price our policy has\r\nrequired.\r\nI have been personally moved in recent days by the\r\naddresses made by the President of the African National\r\nCongress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, before the United Nations\r\nSpecial Committee against Apartheid as well as the Joint\r\nAssembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)\r\nGroup of countries and the European Community.\r\nFollowing the recommendations made by Mr. Mandela, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the Commonwealth\r\nSecretariat, as well as the resolution adopted by consensus\r\nin the General Assembly on Friday 8 October, my\r\nGovernment will now take steps to remove legally enforced\r\nsanctions. But in doing so we remain conscious of the\r\ncontinuing - and unfortunate - relevance of Mr. Mandela’s\r\npointed reminder to the Joint Assembly of the ACP Group\r\nand the European Community that:\r\n\"the white minority Government and its institutions ...\r\nshould not be ... treated as though they were the\r\nrepresentative of all the people of South Africa.\"\r\nThe struggle for real equality for the African citizens of\r\nSouth Africa is certainly not over. In some respects, it has\r\nscarcely begun. My Government believes very strongly that\r\nthe achievement of a genuinely stable, democratic and\r\nmulti-racial South Africa requires increasing opportunities\r\nfor access to and participation in all areas of society,\r\nincluding the economy, by the country’s African population.\r\nMy next subject is the progress towards peace in the\r\nMiddle East. Successive Governments of Papua New\r\nGuinea have consistently followed a policy of supporting\r\nthe right of Israel to exist within secure borders, while\r\nrecognizing the Palestinian people’s right to a homeland.\r\nWe are accordingly both impressed and encouraged by the\r\ndramatic, bold and hopeful agreements reached by the Israeli\r\nGovernment and the Palestine Liberation Organization.\r\nWe commend the steps that have since been taken,\r\nincluding the diplomatic and material support provided by\r\nother Governments to facilitate implementation of those\r\nagreements. As our Prime Minister, the Right Honourable\r\nPaias Wingti, has already announced, the Government of\r\nPapua New Guinea will do what little it can to further the\r\nprocess, by acknowledging the constructive role being played\r\nby the Palestine Liberation Organization and examining ways\r\nin which we might seek to strengthen relations with the\r\nlegitimate representatives of the Palestinian people.\r\nI come now to the reform and revitalization of the\r\nUnited Nations and the recharging of its resources.\r\nThe welcome developments in southern Africa and the\r\nMiddle East, particularly those related to Israel, the occupied\r\nterritories and the Palestine Liberation Organization, reveal\r\nboth strengths and weaknesses in the United Nations, and\r\nsuggest that while there are situations in which the United\r\nNations can play an important, even vital, role, there are also\r\nsituations in which it cannot.\r\nWe must recognize that when the United Nations itself\r\ncannot, for whatever reason, be effective, then individual\r\nGovernments, such as Norway’s, regional organizations, such\r\nas the Organization of African Unity, or some other body\r\nmay be able to initiate or facilitate a positive outcome.\r\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea welcomes the\r\nreforms which are gradually being made to the United\r\nNations system: in the Secretariat and other organs, and in\r\nthe manner in which our deliberations are organized. We\r\nalso welcome the generally revitalized role that our\r\nOrganization aspires to play in international relations. But\r\nwe must remember that internal reform and reorganization\r\nare only as important as their eventual outcome.\r\nA revitalized United Nations must not be allowed to\r\nbecome an instrument of sectional interests or ill-planned\r\nadventurism. In the context of the contrast between the\r\nevidently satisfactory outcome of United Nations efforts in\r\nCambodia and the uncertainties of the situation in Somalia,\r\nmy Government feels a need to sound a cautionary warning.\r\nThe terrible events unfolding in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nparticularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the mounting\r\ntoll of human death, injury and suffering resulting from\r\nconflicts in parts of the former Soviet Union reinforce my\r\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 5\r\nGovernment’s reservations about aspects of the current\r\ndebate over the part that the United Nations can and should\r\nplay in the post-cold-war international order.\r\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea is also\r\nconscious of the selectivity and costs of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping, peace-observing and peacemaking operations,\r\nand of the need to ensure that the Organization is reformed,\r\nrevitalized and re-endowed with sufficient resources to make\r\na difference to the very basis of peace in developing\r\ncountries: development itself.\r\nMy next topic is decolonization, indigenous people and\r\nnatural resources. In this, the United Nations International\r\nYear of the World’s Indigenous People, my Government had\r\nthe rare privilege of hosting a Regional Seminar of the\r\nSpecial Committee of 24 on decolonization, chaired by\r\nPapua New Guinea’s Permanent Representative at the United\r\nNations. The occasion gave us an opportunity to reaffirm\r\nour commitment to the decolonization of New Caledonia,\r\nwith special safeguards for its indigenous people, the\r\nKanaks. The Government of Papua New Guinea is strongly\r\nopposed to any suggestion that the Matignon Accords might\r\nnot be fully honoured. The same position has been adopted\r\nby our partners in the Melanesian Spearhead Group and the\r\nSouth Pacific Forum.\r\nIn addition to the question of New Caledonia, the\r\nRegional Seminar also focused attention on other relics of\r\nEuropean colonialism, including French Polynesia, where\r\nPolynesian demands for independence seem to be gaining\r\nstrength.\r\nElsewhere in the South Pacific, the negotiated\r\nsettlement between the Governments of Nauru and Australia\r\nhas been widely welcomed for the redress it provides for a\r\nlong period of colonial exploitation of Nauru’s principal\r\nland-based natural resource and the destruction of much of\r\nits natural environment.\r\nThe settlement is also arousing considerable interest as\r\nto its possible implications in other former Trust Territories\r\nand colonial dependencies. The Government of Papua New\r\nGuinea is only one of a number of interested parties which\r\nhave the matter under close examination. My Government\r\nis also only one among many in welcoming, and wishing to\r\nencourage, efforts to recognize the rights and to improve the\r\nsituation of other indigenous people in the South Pacific and\r\nelsewhere.\r\nTogether with our partners in the Melanesian Spearhead\r\nGroup - the Governments of Solomon Islands and Vanuatu\r\n- we have signed a Declaration on Cooperation in\r\nDevelopment of Natural Resources. One of the explicit\r\nobjectives of the Declaration is to facilitate implementation\r\nof the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.\r\nAnother objective, which has yet to be realized, is to\r\nsupplement existing efforts in relation to regional fisheries\r\nby broadening and deepening cooperation between the\r\nGovernments of countries in the South Pacific where other\r\nnatural resources are being developed, often by outsiders.\r\nThe crisis in Papua New Guinea’s North Solomons\r\nProvince is an unfortunate and costly internal affair of Papua\r\nNew Guinea. It continues, still unresolved, even as\r\nGovernment and other services are being restored. I am\r\ntherefore pleased to report that my Government has recently\r\nbeen engaged in productive exchanges with the Government\r\nof the Solomon Islands, particularly concerning the spill-over\r\neffects of the crisis on and near the common border.\r\nFollowing these exchanges, I have issued an invitation\r\non the Government’s behalf to the Joint Assembly of the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States party to the\r\nLomé Convention and the European Community to send a\r\nvisiting mission to Papua New Guinea, including the North\r\nSolomons Province, to assess the situation and to\r\nrecommend how it might assist in rehabilitation.\r\nThe Government has also announced its intention to\r\nwork towards an All-Bougainville Leaders’ Conference to\r\ntry to resolve the crisis by political means. The Government\r\nof Solomon Islands has offered its cooperation in what has\r\nbeen, at times, a rather difficult situation. We hope to\r\ncontinue our dialogue over long-term measures to strengthen\r\nbilateral relations.\r\nWith respect to regional and global economic\r\ncooperation, the Government of Papua New Guinea, like\r\nmost other Members of the United Nations, is concerned at\r\nthe possibility that reform of the international trading system\r\nmight fail as a result of the apparent intransigence of vested\r\ninterests in certain developed countries during the final\r\nstages of the Uruguay Round of negotiations of the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We also do not\r\nbelieve that regional trading blocs can be an adequate\r\nsubstitute for an equitable and orderly international trading\r\nsystem.\r\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea does not see\r\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC) as\r\na replacement or a rival for an updated version of GATT.\r\nBut we do regard APEC as being important to our interests.\r\nMore than 80 per cent in value of exports from Papua New\r\nGuinea go to the existing APEC member countries. Nearly\r\n90 per cent of our imports come from exactly the same\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncountries. Other aspects of Papua New Guinea’s\r\ninternational economic relations are just as deeply enmeshed\r\nwith APEC members. With encouragement from existing\r\nmembers, my Government has therefore applied to join\r\nAPEC. We believe that it would not be right for such a\r\nbody to continue without a single member from the centre\r\nof a region whose name it bears: the Pacific. We look\r\nforward to an early - and positive - response to our\r\napplication.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to say the following:\r\nNo human being can have failed to be deeply moved\r\nby, or to feel the utmost sympathy for, people affected by\r\nthe disastrous earthquake which occurred in India in late\r\nSeptember.\r\nNo one who has been following the developments\r\nconsequent on the changes in the former Soviet Union can\r\nhave failed to be both excited and concerned by the dramatic\r\npolitical and military confrontations which have been\r\noccurring in the Russian Federation. All of us must surely\r\nbe concerned at reports that nuclear testing has been\r\nresumed, at the possibility that more tests might follow, and\r\nthat weapons of mass destruction might grow in number,\r\npower and circulation.\r\nIn short, notwithstanding the progress made towards\r\nfinding lasting solutions to some long-standing issues since\r\nthe cold war ended, we continue to live in a rapidly\r\nchanging, often fragile and uncertain world. Able by virtue\r\nof our membership of the United Nations at least to let our\r\nviews be known on what are some of the most important\r\nand pressing issues of our time, the Government of Papua\r\nNew Guinea has, therefore, chosen to give close attention to\r\nan issue of particular concern to developing countries, to\r\nexplore avenues of cooperation with other States, and to\r\npropose a United Nations initiative on \"Opportunity and\r\nParticipation\". Let me end by repeating my previous call for\r\nmembers’ support for a proposal intended to assist in\r\nidentifying what the people and Government of Papua New\r\nGuinea believe to be common interests, global problems and\r\npractical solutions.\r\nMr. PAPAZIAN (Armenia): Allow me to congratulate\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Insanally on his election to the\r\npresidency of the forty-eighth session of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly. Given his talent and experience, I am\r\nconfident that he will guide this session to the successful\r\ncompletion of the noble mission entrusted to it by the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. I would also like to express\r\nmy appreciation and thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Ganev,\r\nfor the contribution he made to accomplishing the tasks of\r\nthe last session.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to extend my warm\r\nwelcome and congratulations to the six States that have been\r\nadmitted to membership of the United Nations over the past\r\nyear.\r\nI stand before the Assembly as the Foreign Minister of\r\na small, land-locked, newly independent country of 3.5\r\nmillion under complete blockade, with no energy resources,\r\nstill not recovered from the devastating earthquake of 1988,\r\nflooded by hundred of thousands of refugees fleeing the\r\nconflict between Nagorny-Karabakh and Azerbaijan, and\r\nunder constant provocation by Azerbaijan to be drawn into\r\nthat conflict.\r\nI am also the Foreign Minister of the only democracy\r\nin the region, an island of stability in a sea of political chaos\r\nand turmoil, a country with close to 30 registered political\r\nparties, a free press and freedom of conscience and religion,\r\nand with laws guaranteeing civil and political rights and\r\nfreedoms. The Government of Armenia has also made\r\nheadway towards establishing a market economy and has\r\ntaken several significant steps to integrate its economy into\r\nthe global economy. Armenia has moved swiftly in many\r\nareas of reform. Most agricultural land and homes and\r\nmany small enterprises have already been privatized, and a\r\ntax programme, a pricing policy and legislative reform to\r\ncreate the legal framework for a free-market economy are\r\neffectively under way. Nevertheless, substantial work will\r\nneed to be done if these advances are to contribute\r\neffectively to a successful transition.\r\nIt is encouraging to see that the United Nations has\r\nrecognized that full integration of the economies in transition\r\ninto the world economy will not only help those economies\r\nbut also have a positive impact on world trade, economic\r\ngrowth and development, and is prepared to support the\r\nprocess of bringing about economic reform and restructuring\r\nthrough its special bodies and specialized agencies.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to convey my\r\nGovernment’s deep gratitude to the Secretary-General for\r\nestablishing the United Nations - United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) interim office in Armenia.\r\nAs a result of adverse natural and geopolitical circumstances,\r\nArmenia is currently in a state of economic and social crisis.\r\nWe see the importance of short-term assistance in these\r\ntimes of great need, but at the same time are fully aware that\r\nit is the pursuit of long-term goals that will bring Armenia\r\nto function at full capacity as a member of the international\r\ncommunity. We are convinced that the presence of United\r\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 7\r\nNations specialized agencies in Armenia such as the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the\r\nWorld Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), and the United Nations\r\nFund for Population Activities (UNFPA), providing technical\r\nand advisory assistance and coordination would enhance the\r\ndurability of the transition that is well under way.\r\nAs we and other nations grapple with problems unique\r\nto each, the collapse of regimes and empires continues to\r\nfuel violent conflicts throughout the world. But there is an\r\napparent change in the pattern of international conflicts.\r\nVery few wars are fought between nation States any more.\r\nThe rest are struggles for self-determination turned into\r\nbloody conflict and civil war in one and the same nation\r\nState. These movements need a forum in which to lodge\r\ntheir claims, identify and understand their rights, negotiate\r\nwith government authorities, establish just administration of\r\ntheir affairs, and peacefully work out realistic political and\r\nterritorial arrangements for the future.\r\nNow more than ever, it is incumbent upon the United\r\nNations to revisit its provision of non-intervention in matters\r\nwhich are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of\r\nMember States, and to define more stringently the extent of\r\nthe impact of a conflict on the peace and security of other\r\nnations. Having in clear view the essential role the United\r\nNations can play in enhancing peacemaking efforts\r\nthroughout the world, we concur with recent proposals in\r\nacademic circles that the United Nations transform the\r\nnear-moribund Trusteeship Council into a modern clearing-\r\nhouse for self-determination.\r\nUnder the proposed system, a \"trust territory\" would be\r\nthat part of a Member State voluntarily placed into\r\ntrusteeship by the Government of that State for the purpose\r\nof resolving a self-determination claim under United Nations\r\nsupervision without prejudicing the final status of the\r\nterritory. We believe that the trusteeship system could save\r\nlives and prevent the escalation of a self-determination\r\nstruggle to a devastating civil war, or worse, to a regional\r\nconflict involving other countries.\r\nThe conflict over Nagorny-Karabakh has claimed the\r\nlives of more than 10,000 people and has caused close to a\r\nmillion innocent people to be uprooted from their homes\r\nduring the past five years. This conflict continues to\r\nthreaten the security and stability of the whole region. The\r\ninternational community has yet to come to grips with the\r\nroot cause of the conflict and devise appropriate measures to\r\nfind a peaceful solution.\r\nArmenia’s position on the Nagorny-Karabakh conflict\r\nhas been clear and consistent since day one. The conflict is\r\nbetween the people of Nagorny-Karabakh, who are striving\r\nfor their self-determination, and the Azerbaijani Government,\r\nwhich is refusing to address the rights and security concerns\r\nof the people of Nagorny-Karabakh.\r\nAs an interested party, Armenia has advocated an\r\nunconditional cease-fire and has fully supported all the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)\r\ninitiatives. The Government of Armenia sees no alternative\r\nto the peaceful settlement of the Karabakh conflict, than that\r\nwhich can be reached within the framework of the CSCE\r\nMinsk Conference.\r\nThe recent developments of the peace process are\r\npromising. Nagorny-Karabakh has at long last been\r\nrecognized as a party to the conflict and direct talks between\r\nthe leadership of Nagorny-Karabakh and Azerbaijani\r\nauthorities, mediated by the Russian Federation, have\r\nbrought about a cease-fire, which has continued to hold for\r\nmore than a month now and is unprecedented in the\r\nfive-year history of this bloody conflict. On 28 September\r\nduring its meeting in Paris, the Minsk Group produced the\r\n\"Adjusted timetable of urgent steps to implement Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993)\", to which\r\nArmenia has given its agreement, and is hopeful that a\r\nsimilar position will be adopted by the main parties to the\r\nconflict, Azerbaijan and Nagorny-Karabakh.\r\nThere is now a genuine opportunity for peace.\r\nTherefore, the convening of the Minsk Conference must not\r\nbe delayed. Once peace is established, legal questions, first\r\nand foremost among which is the issue of the status of\r\nNagorny-Karabakh, can be negotiated. The clear position of\r\nthe Government of Armenia is to accept and be gratified by\r\nany solution agreed upon between Nagorny-Karabakh and\r\nAzerbaijan at the Minsk Conference.\r\nThe CSCE has an explicit security role in the new\r\nworld order, consistent with the provisions of Chapter VIII\r\nof the United Nations Charter. Last May, the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and the Chairman\r\nof the CSCE Council agreed on a framework for cooperation\r\nand coordination between the United Nations Secretariat and\r\nthe CSCE, namely through the regular exchange of\r\ninformation in the fields of early warning, conflict\r\nprevention and the promotion of democratic values and\r\nhuman rights. The CSCE is also striving to obtain United\r\nNations observer status, an initiative which Armenia fully\r\nsupports.\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe successful cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the CSCE over the Nagorny-Karabakh conflict can serve\r\nas a case study in how to reconcile, practically, the\r\nconflicting claims of regionalism and universalism. Such\r\ncooperation will enhance the role of regional organizations\r\nin conflict prevention, peace-keeping and the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes.\r\nArmenia appreciates the Secretary-General’s report \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\" which embodies the notions of\r\npeace-keeping, peacemaking and post-conflict peace--\r\nbuilding. History has taught us, however, that development\r\nis intrinsic to peace, and that the two can no longer be\r\nthought of as separate processes. Starvation, poverty and\r\npoor living conditions in many parts of the world loom as\r\nserious threats to stability and peace. The United Nations in\r\nits commitment to secure peace for all the Earth’s\r\ninhabitants must place development high among its priorities.\r\nIndeed, it must establish economic and social development\r\nas guiding principles for the Organization’s activities.\r\nArmenia fully supports the Secretary-General’s initiative for\r\nan agenda for development and looks forward to contributing\r\nto this important milestone towards world peace. Armenia\r\nalso gives its full support to the convocation of the 1995\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen.\r\nToday, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nposes another grave threat to both global and regional\r\nsecurity and stability. Armenia supports the indefinite\r\nextension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\r\nbeyond 1995. The United Nations should work to ensure\r\nuniversality and strict compliance with the Convention on\r\nthe prohibition of chemical weapons.\r\nDevelopment and human rights are also mutually\r\ninclusive values. There can be no genuine development\r\nunless systems of thought and government are based on\r\nrespect for the full spectrum of the rights of individuals. It\r\nis auspicious that this year coincides with the forty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nThe spirit of the Declaration and the Vienna World\r\nConference on Human Rights held last June will\r\nundoubtedly deepen the understanding of the significance of\r\nhuman rights for stability, freedom, peace, progress and\r\njustice.\r\nIt is my Government’s strong conviction that the\r\nadoption and implementation of all human rights principles\r\nby nation States will create solid ground for unity and\r\nharmony throughout a world which is being transformed and\r\nis searching for new constants.\r\nFor more effective implementation of the principles of\r\nhuman rights we feel it is imperative to establish the post of\r\nhigh commissioner for human rights and a permanent\r\ninternational criminal court where cases of gross violations\r\nof human rights and other crimes against humanity are\r\nsubmitted and prosecuted.\r\nIn 1995, the United Nations will celebrate its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. In the past 50 years, the Organization has\r\ngrown and has witnessed historic events, in many of which\r\nit has played a considerable role. As the Organization has\r\nentered a period in which it is being called upon to take an\r\nincreasingly active guiding role in a changing world, it too\r\nmust be prepared to respond effectively to these changes.\r\nArmenia supports the call for restructuring the Security\r\nCouncil that has been placed before the United Nations by\r\nits Member States. Because the international community is\r\nlooking to the Security Council to take a more dynamic role\r\nin the maintenance of international peace, it is necessary that\r\nthe Security Council increase its membership in order that it\r\nmay be able to address the issues before it in a more\r\nbalanced and equitable way.\r\nImproving the United Nations administrative\r\nperformance must also become a top priority at this time.\r\nWe welcome the current initiatives of the Secretary-General\r\nto streamline the Organization’s administrative and\r\nmanagement structures and procedures to meet the demands\r\nthat are now being placed upon the Organization.\r\nAs the world seems to have grown accustomed to the\r\ndreadful routine of tragic news coming from various regional\r\nhotbeds, it is inspiring to reflect on some of the more\r\npositive reverberations of the end of the cold war, which can\r\nbe epitomized by the historic accord between the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel signed recently.\r\nIt is my privilege to salute the leaders of Israel and the PLO\r\nfor taking this courageous step.\r\nNo less significant are the processes currently in motion\r\nin South Africa. Armenia joins the other Member States in\r\nsupporting the negotiating process there, and believes that\r\nlifting economic sanctions at this time could encourage the\r\npeople of South Africa to take up the task of building a truly\r\nfree and democratic country.\r\nIn the United Nations, the end of the cold war\r\ncontinues to translate into ever closer cooperation between\r\nits Members. In 1992, as in 1991, despite the large volume\r\nand the diversified nature of the issues examined in the\r\nSecurity Council, none of the members of the Council\r\nexercised its right to veto. There is a growing harmony of\r\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 9\r\ninterests among nations that is creating an atmosphere of\r\ntrust and cooperation, which are the prerequisites for the\r\nrealization of the goals envisioned by the founders of the\r\nUnited Nations 48 years ago in San Francisco.\r\nIndeed, for the first time since its inception, the United\r\nNations has been given the opportunity to become what it\r\nwas intended to be: a collective security system, with a\r\nCharter providing for special forms of cooperation between\r\nsovereign States, designed to ensure peace and prosperity\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nMr. SENILOLI (Fiji): On behalf of the people and\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Fiji, I congratulate\r\nAmbassador Insanally very warmly on his election as\r\nPresident of the Assembly. I am confident that his extensive\r\nknowledge of the United Nations system and his wide\r\nexperience in the field of international relations will help\r\nguide this session to a successful conclusion.\r\nI wish to pay a tribute to Mr. Stoyan Ganev for the\r\nexcellent manner in which, as President, he conducted the\r\nbusiness of this Assembly at its last session. I express my\r\nadmiration and deep appreciation to him for a job well done.\r\nI also congratulate him for his initiative in rationalizing the\r\nwork of the Assembly, and especially in rationalizing its\r\nCommittee structure.\r\nMy delegation applauds the excellent work done by our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in the period\r\nsince he assumed his high office. I take this opportunity to\r\nexpress my Government’s deep appreciation for his untiring\r\nefforts in tackling the difficult and complex problems facing\r\nthe world Organization.\r\nI should also like to extend a warm welcome to the\r\nnew States Members of the United Nations, the Principality\r\nof Andorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, the Principality of\r\nMonaco, the Slovak Republic and The Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia. I am confident that the\r\nOrganization, as it continues to strive for universality, will\r\ngreatly benefit from their participation in its work.\r\nNew threats are endangering international peace and\r\nsecurity in all corners of the world. Incipient nationalism,\r\nethnic conflicts and excessive protectionism are threatening\r\npeace, security, and growth in trade. Thus, a heavy\r\nresponsibility is placed on this Organization, which, as we\r\nall know, is the main body responsible for promoting social\r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\r\nBehind these complexities, there are also many\r\ndevastating structural problems that undermine even the best\r\nefforts to achieve security and economic progress.\r\nPopulation growth, if left unchecked, will add 97 million\r\npeople a year throughout the 1990s. Poverty, disease,\r\nfamine and oppression account for the 18 million refugees\r\nand 24 million displaced persons throughout the world. The\r\ngap between the rich and the poor countries has not\r\nnarrowed, but continues to grow as economic difficulties in\r\nthe industrialized countries have led to increased\r\nprotectionist measures against trade. Environmental\r\ndegradation further compounds these problems.\r\nIn the light of these trends, we must underscore the\r\nneed for better international cooperation in order to arrive at\r\neffective solutions. This, we believe, is a critical element in\r\nmoving us towards the creation of an international order in\r\nwhich this Organization assumes greater importance as the\r\ncentre of global endeavours.\r\nThe process of reviewing the role of the Organization\r\nthat is currently under way is therefore very timely. We\r\nhope that the review will assist greatly in determining how\r\nthe United Nations can be strengthened and, most important,\r\nhow each of us as Member countries might best contribute\r\nto the new order.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, has quite rightly stressed the need for adequate\r\nresources. We share his anxiety, and join in his call to\r\nMembers to ensure that their contributions to the regular\r\nbudget, as well as to the peace-keeping budget, are met on\r\ntime and in full. We must make every effort to explore all\r\npossible avenues for ensuring that the Organization is put\r\nback onto a viable financial path.\r\nMy Government would like to pay a tribute to the\r\nentire United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia\r\n(UNTAC) team for the way in which they carried out their\r\nmission in particularly difficult and dangerous conditions.\r\nFiji is pleased to have joined other Members of the United\r\nNations in restoring peace in Cambodia through its\r\nparticipation in UNTAC.\r\nThat mission has now successfully completed its major\r\ntask. For the people of Cambodia, who unambiguously\r\ndemonstrated their desire for peace and democracy, it is the\r\nbeginning of a new era. We urge all factions to cooperate\r\nfully with the new Government by keeping alive the spirit of\r\nthe Agreements signed in Paris.\r\nThe age-old problem in the Middle East has taken a\r\nnew turn during the past month. This turn of events spells\r\nhope for the future in the Middle East - indeed, in the entire\r\nworld and for all humanity. The desire of both Prime\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMinister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Chairman Yasser\r\nArafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to\r\nachieve peace for their peoples has necessitated the\r\ndismantling of differences that have existed for decades.\r\nThe Washington accords should pave the way for a lasting\r\npeace.\r\nHumanity has been touched by this historic event - the\r\ncoming together of two arch-rivals for the sake of peace.\r\nWe congratulate Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat\r\n- indeed, all who have laboured to bring this peace pact to\r\nreality. We must also acknowledge the contribution of the\r\nUnited States of America and, indeed, the United Nations\r\nand others over the years.\r\nWhile positive developments are taking place in the\r\nMiddle East and Cambodia, Fiji is deeply saddened at the\r\nfact that the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains\r\nunresolved. Our profound sympathy goes to all who have\r\nsuffered untold misery. Such a tragedy should not be\r\nallowed to continue. We recognize that the issue is a highly\r\ncomplex one, but the international community must do all it\r\ncan to stop the slaughter, prevent the conflict from\r\nspreading, and achieve a lasting and equitable settlement.\r\nWe are equally saddened at the events in Somalia. The\r\nsuccess of the United Nations Operation in Somalia\r\n(UNOSOM) in meeting the humanitarian challenge has cast\r\na ray of hope, for which the United Nations deserves praise\r\nand, indeed, support. However, recent violence against\r\nUNOSOM II personnel must be condemned, and efforts to\r\nfind ways of reducing tension between the peace-keepers and\r\nthe local population must be given high priority.\r\nHaving for years witnessed the repugnant policy of\r\napartheid in South Africa, we are pleased at the rapidity with\r\nwhich that policy has recently been broken down. We\r\ncongratulate the leadership in South Africa - the South\r\nAfrican Government, the African National Congress (ANC)\r\nand others - for their courage, determination and foresight in\r\ngetting together and dismantling apartheid. The United\r\nNations has played a major role in the process, but we\r\nshould continue the effort until a democratic Government is\r\nelected by all - I repeat: all - the peoples of South Africa.\r\nFiji, like the other members of the South Pacific Forum,\r\nshares the sentiments that the Secretary-General expresses in\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\", in which he highlights the positive\r\nrole that regional organizations can play in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security in their own regions. Fiji\r\nwill support such regional initiatives.\r\nOn the economic front, we believe that a successful\r\nconclusion to the Uruguay Round is vital to economic\r\ngrowth and prosperity in all our countries. Only increased\r\naccess to markets for our exports, especially in areas of\r\ncomparative advantage, will enable us to increase our\r\nexternal purchasing power - our ability to pay for imports\r\nfrom the developed countries. In any event, we look\r\nforward to a genuinely equitable outcome that will include\r\na substantial and liberalizing effect on trade in agricultural\r\nproducts.\r\nSlow progress in finalizing the Round has led to the\r\nformation and strengthening of regional trading blocs. Many\r\nnew initiatives now being put in place are defensive\r\nresponses to existing regional trading arrangements. These\r\nhave the potential to weaken the multilateral character of the\r\ntrading system, as many of them do not comply with the\r\nspirit and the provisions of the General Agreement on\r\nTariffs and Trade (GATT).\r\nDeveloping countries, it has been estimated, lose about\r\n$100 billion a year in export revenues as a result of market\r\nbarriers in industrialized countries - about twice the official\r\ndevelopment assistance that the industrialized countries\r\nprovide. Furthermore, it is most ironic that taxpayers in the\r\nindustrialized countries pay both for aid and for imports that\r\nare more costly as a result of trade barriers, while the\r\npoorest developing countries lose more in trade than they\r\ngain in aid. For these reasons alone, further progress in\r\ntrade liberalization, through success in the Uruguay Round,\r\nis very urgent, and we join other delegations in stressing that\r\nno effort should be spared in bringing the Round to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion.\r\nOf the 42 resolutions on disarmament issues adopted by\r\nthe Assembly at its last session, 15 deal with various ways\r\nof controlling nuclear arms, the management of nuclear\r\nwaste, the banning of nuclear tests and the elimination of\r\nnuclear weapons. In this regard, we welcome the decisions\r\nby nuclear Powers to extend their testing moratorium, and\r\nwe regret very much that this moratorium has just been\r\nbreached. We call on all nuclear Powers to continue to\r\nhonour the moratorium. In August this year, the South\r\nPacific Forum welcomed the commitment by the\r\nGovernments of France, the United Kingdom and the United\r\nStates to the early negotiation of a comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty. We take this opportunity to urge all the nuclear-\r\nweapon States to participate actively in the negotiations and\r\nto adopt the Treaty as soon as possible.\r\nThe signing of the chemical-weapons Convention in\r\nParis early this year was a major step forward in the process\r\nof eliminating weapons of mass destruction. As a\r\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 11\r\ndemonstration of its commitment to that end, Fiji has not\r\nonly signed the Convention but also ratified it - the first\r\ncountry to do so.\r\nIn the South Pacific Forum, member Governments,\r\nincluding the Government of Fiji, highlighted the importance\r\nof an enhanced international regime to deal with possible\r\ntransboundary damage arising from peaceful nuclear activity,\r\nand noted the absence of effective international rules for\r\nnuclear liability. Members of the Forum have agreed to\r\nparticipate in the ongoing deliberations of the Standing\r\nCommittee on Nuclear Liability convened by the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and to support the\r\nestablishment of a comprehensive international legal regime\r\ndealing with liability for nuclear damage and reflecting fully\r\nthe principle that the polluter should pay.\r\nFiji welcomes the continuing growth in the number of\r\nparties to the non-proliferation Treaty and will support\r\nindefinite extension of the Treaty.\r\nIn support of international peace and security, we have\r\nconsistently contributed to many peace-keeping operations\r\nover the years. Since our first participation in peace-keeping\r\noperations in 1978, Fiji has been involved in seven. We pay\r\ntribute to the men and women currently engaged in United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations around the world.\r\nPeace-keepers are being increasingly asked to serve in\r\nhigh-risk environments. That these are high-risk operations\r\nis tragically borne out by the fact that hundreds of\r\npeace-keepers have made the supreme sacrifice in their\r\nservice to humanity.\r\nThe time is right for the issue of the safety and security\r\nof peace-keeping personnel to be addressed in a more\r\nsystematic, comprehensive and practical manner, and we\r\nsupport the notion wholeheartedly. The related question of\r\nresponsibility for attacks on United Nations and associated\r\npersonnel, and measures to ensure that those responsible for\r\nsuch attacks are brought to justice, is also now an important\r\none to address. We shall fully support any effort in that\r\ndirection.\r\nApart from the large increase in the number of\r\npeace-keeping operations, many important changes are taking\r\nplace in the nature of peace-keeping. The eight\r\npeace-keeping operations undertaken since the end of the\r\ncold war have involved not only traditional military activities\r\nbut also a wide range of humanitarian and civilian activities.\r\nThe constantly changing nature of the various crises means\r\nthat we must increasingly be more innovative in designing\r\npeace-keeping operations, as they are normally very costly.\r\nAs indicated in the report of the Secretary-General, the\r\n17 peace-keeping operations are now costing the\r\nOrganization some $2.8 billion annually. To some extent,\r\nthe answer to the increasing costs lies in more preventive\r\ndiplomacy aimed at defusing potential conflicts. Moreover,\r\nthe involvement of Member States, either on an individual\r\nbasis or through regional organizations, in peace-building\r\nand peace-keeping activities appears to be another effective\r\nway of preventing military clashes. In this regard, the\r\nSecretary-General has placed before us several suggestions\r\nwhich, we believe, deserve our serious consideration and\r\naction.\r\nI now wish to turn briefly to a subject that has been the\r\nfocus of a great deal of attention, especially during the last\r\nthree years; that is, the subject of sustainable development.\r\nSeveral resolutions adopted by the Assembly on following\r\nup the important decisions taken at Rio about 15 months ago\r\nare now being implemented at various levels. It is most\r\nencouraging that we now have 162 countries that have\r\nsigned the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and\r\n26 countries that have ratified it.\r\nFiji ratified the Convention in February this year, and\r\nhopes that the required number of ratifications, 50, will soon\r\nbe achieved, so that the Convention can enter into force. As\r\nglobal warming and a rise in sea level are amongst the most\r\nserious threats to the Pacific region and to the survival of\r\nsome small island States, Fiji reaffirms its support for the\r\nConvention and takes this opportunity to urge all States to\r\nsign and ratify it as soon as possible.\r\nFiji has been active in the area of environmental\r\nmanagement and protection. The Rio Conference has,\r\nhowever, changed the way in which many of us now view\r\nenvironment and development issues. More than ever\r\nbefore, we are committed to the idea that the development\r\nof our economy and society must not come at the expense\r\nof our environment. To the contrary: development and\r\nenvironmental protection are complementary.\r\nMy Government is committed to sound environmental\r\nmanagement and protection as an integral part of our\r\ndecision-making process. A national environment strategy\r\nhas now been adopted by the Government, and will form the\r\nbasis for further work on environmental issues in Fiji.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment has recognized in the Agenda 21 plan of action\r\nfor sustainable development, that small island developing\r\ncountries are a special case for sustainable development.\r\nSmall island countries supporting small communities are\r\necologically fragile and vulnerable; because of our small\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsize, our resources are limited, and because of our\r\ngeographic dispersion and isolation from markets, we are\r\nplaced at a disadvantage economically and have limited\r\neconomies of scale.\r\nOur dependence on the ocean and our coastal\r\nenvironments is also very significant. They are not only of\r\nstrategic importance to us; they also constitute a valuable\r\ndevelopment resource.\r\nIt was in this context that, last year, we welcomed the\r\nadoption of General Assembly resolution 47/189 calling for\r\na Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States, to be convened in\r\nApril 1994. We appreciate the very important work that has\r\nbeen put into the organizational session and the preparatory\r\nmeetings, convened early this year. We hope that the\r\nConference will be successful and will help us not only to\r\nidentify the most critical issues involved but also to agree on\r\nprecise and practical solutions for overcoming our\r\nvulnerabilities. We urge all member countries to participate\r\nin this Conference and to assist in finding solutions to\r\nproblems that have buffeted small island countries for a very\r\nlong time.\r\nThe small island States contain a wealth of biological\r\ndiversity of global significance - our rich marine ecosystems\r\nrivalling the better-known tropical rain forests in their\r\nimportance to life on this planet and in their potential for\r\nnew knowledge and new products, including medicines. An\r\ninternational cooperative approach to conserving our coastal\r\nand marine resources would benefit not just the island States\r\nbut the world as a whole.\r\nThe international community met in July this year and\r\nexamined ways and means of conserving and managing\r\nstraddling and highly migratory fish stocks. We believe that\r\ngood progress was made at this meeting in identifying the\r\nproblems that exist and areas in which fisheries cooperation\r\nbetween States could be improved.\r\nThere are still, however, several important tasks\r\nremaining that need to be completed before the next session\r\nof the Assembly. Fiji, therefore, fully supports the\r\nconvening of two further sessions next year to enable the\r\nConference to reach agreement on all issues relating to the\r\nconservation and management of straddling and highly\r\nmigratory fish stocks.\r\nFiji was the first country to ratify the 1982 United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are\r\ntherefore gratified that the Convention is soon to achieve the\r\n60 ratifications required for its entry into force. We\r\ncontinue to support all efforts towards universal participation\r\nin this very important Convention, which is to govern over\r\n70 per cent of the Earth’s surface. In this regard, we are\r\npleased that all States - including now the United States -\r\nare engaged in the ongoing dialogue to resolve the\r\noutstanding problems and thereby pave the way towards\r\nuniversality for the Convention.\r\nOver the next few years, the Organization will be\r\nfocusing its attention and energies on the convening of\r\nseveral very important international conferences. While\r\nthese conferences will be important in themselves, as they\r\nwill bring together the world community, they will not only\r\ndiscuss issues that are assigned to them but will also provide\r\nopportunities to arrive by consensus at solutions to many of\r\nthe critical problems facing the world today.\r\nThe World Summit on Social Development planned for\r\n1995 will help to strengthen social development in all\r\ncountries by giving political impetus, at the highest level, to\r\nthe promotion of social policies. The three core issues that\r\nhave been established for the Summit - the alleviation of\r\npoverty, the growth of employment, and the enhancement of\r\nsocial integration, especially of disadvantaged groups - are\r\nall essential. Above all, the Summit should, in our view,\r\nfoster greater understanding of the importance of social\r\ndevelopment and, particularly, its relationship with economic\r\ndevelopment and protection of the environment.\r\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women, to be\r\nconvened in Beijing in 1995, will, we hope, be action--\r\noriented and provide an opportunity to review past activities\r\nand, most important, set new priorities. For its part, my\r\nGovernment is fully committed to strengthening the role of\r\nwomen in economic and social development and has taken\r\nseveral steps to integrate women into the mainstream of\r\nnational development. Towards this end, plans have been\r\nformulated and are being implemented by the Ministry of\r\nWomen and Culture, other sectoral ministries and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. Women constitute more than\r\n50 per cent of Fiji’s population, which makes them valuable\r\npartners in the growth and development of our country and\r\nthe uplifting of our people.\r\nWe are, at the same time, also turning our attention to\r\nthe situation and needs of children in Fiji as we continue to\r\nparticipate actively in Universal Children’s Day. Fiji has\r\nratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child and has\r\nsigned the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and\r\nDevelopment of Children in the 1990s. We have also\r\nundertaken a detailed study of the situation of children in\r\nFiji and have identified areas which require our attention.\r\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 13\r\nWe are now in the process of following up the\r\nrecommendations of this study.\r\nFiji, as a multiracial and multicultural community,\r\nattaches great significance to family values and family\r\ntraditions. We therefore welcome and appreciate the\r\ndecision by the United Nations to observe 1994 as the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. My Government has\r\nalready formed a national committee, comprising\r\nrepresentatives from both government and non-governmental\r\nsectors, to make preparations for observance of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family in a meaningful and\r\npractical way.\r\nThe International Year of the World’s Indigenous\r\nPeople will soon be coming to a close. With the observance\r\nof the International Year the attention of the United Nations\r\nhas for the first time been focused directly and solely on\r\nindigenous peoples. Next year, the Commission on Human\r\nRights will assess the activities of the Year. It is important\r\nthat the voices of indigenous peoples should continue to be\r\nheard, and their right to self-determination, their right to\r\nrebuild their communities in dignity with freedom of choice,\r\nmust continue to receive the full support of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe draft text of a declaration on indigenous peoples’\r\nrights, first proposed in 1985, received the approval of the\r\nWorking Group last July. Fiji welcomes the Working\r\nGroup’s decision as an important step towards a\r\nmuch-needed international instrument on indigenous peoples’\r\nrights.\r\nThe International Year of the World’s Indigenous\r\nPeople, should not, we believe, be treated as an isolated\r\nevent, but as the beginning of a long-term policy of\r\nsupporting, protecting and learning from the world’s\r\nindigenous peoples. For our part, we have set aside a\r\nspecial day in our nation’s calendar to commemorate this\r\nevent, coinciding with the birthday of Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna,\r\none of the great leaders of the indigenous people of Fiji.\r\nThe indigenous people now comprise the majority of\r\nFiji’s population but my Government recognizes the need\r\nand will do its utmost to ensure unity, order, equity and\r\nsecurity for all the people of Fiji, so that we can all live in\r\npeace and harmony. We will continue to ensure that\r\nharmonious relationships are established and maintained both\r\namong our own people at home and with other people\r\nabroad.\r\nWith reference to my own region, the South Pacific, we\r\nare following very closely the current progress in New\r\nCaledonia towards the self-determination of that territory.\r\nWe hope that the developments, as envisaged under the\r\nMatignon and Oudinot accords, will continue so that the\r\nindigenous Kanak population will be fully prepared to take\r\npart in the referendum in 1998 and to decide on the future\r\npolitical status of their country.\r\nSpeaking at the session of the General Assembly last\r\nyear, on 8 October, Fiji’s Prime Minister, Major General\r\nSitiveni Rabuka, promised to initiate a review of the 1990\r\nConstitution of Fiji, which has been the subject of\r\ncontroversy both locally and abroad. I am pleased to say\r\nthat my Government has already set in train the process for\r\nthe review of the Constitution, as promised. The review is\r\nto consider how the provisions of the Constitution can be\r\nimproved upon to reflect fully the concerns and interests of\r\nFiji’s multi-ethnic and multicultural society.\r\nThis Organization, now almost 50 years old, has stood\r\nthe test of time but, like other institutions, it must also adjust\r\nto change. We must continue to examine ways of making\r\nit a forum for both discussion and action on the important\r\nsocial, economic and political issues facing the world\r\ncommunity as they evolve.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm my country’s\r\ncommitment to the United Nations and to the spirit of\r\ninternational cooperation and solidarity that it embodies. My\r\ncountry, and its people, joins with other nations to do its\r\nutmost to seek world peace, stability and sustainable\r\ndevelopment for all. We firmly believe that the United\r\nNations remains the only hope for mankind to achieve peace\r\nand prosperity. It is through the combined efforts of all\r\nMember States, large and small, that we can develop a\r\nglobal environment which is just and equitable and which\r\nreflects the legitimate needs and interests of all peoples.\r\nMiss CHIEPE (Botswana): Botswana and Guyana\r\nhave, since their attainment of independence, both in 1966,\r\nbeen the closest of friends. That is why we have welcomed\r\nthe election of Ambassador Insanally of Guyana to the\r\npresidency of the forty-eighth session with so much warmth\r\nand anticipation. I say \"anticipation\" because we are\r\nconfident that he has the requisite experience, expertise and\r\ndiplomatic finesse to make a good and productive President\r\nfor this most hopeful session of the Organization.\r\nOur gratitude goes to the outgoing President of the\r\nforty-seventh session, the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria, who\r\ngave the best account of his skills in the service of the\r\nAssembly last year.\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe new Members who have just joined the United\r\nNations are most welcome in our midst. We assure them of\r\nour fellowship and readiness to cooperate with them in the\r\nservice of peace here at the United Nations.\r\nWe also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on the creative dynamism he has\r\ninjected into the work of the United Nations. We know his\r\nwork has not been easy. But under his able leadership the\r\nUnited Nations has indeed demonstrated its capacity to serve\r\nas a reliable instrument of impartial management of\r\ninternational conflicts. Increasingly, we are seeing the\r\nfulfilment of the ideas contained in what I think was the\r\nmost forward-looking report ever produced by a Secretary-\r\nGeneral of this Organization, \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nMr. Ansari (India), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nWe commend the efforts the Secretary-General has\r\nundertaken so far to enhance the Organization’s\r\neffectiveness. Botswana understands the concerns raised by\r\nthe Secretary-General when he addressed the Fifth\r\nCommittee in August. Many demands and problems foisted\r\non the United Nations have put a lot of strain on its coffers.\r\nResources made available by Member States are far from\r\nenough to meet these demands. Thus, the Organization is\r\nfacing a financial crisis of unprecedented magnitude. The\r\nbiggest problem, as explained by the Secretary-General, is\r\nthe failure of some Member States to fulfil their financial\r\nobligations by paying the assessed contribution for both the\r\nregular budget and peace-keeping missions. Member States\r\nmust heed the Secretary-General’s call and fulfil their\r\nCharter obligations by paying their contributions in full and\r\non time.\r\nAt the same time, it would be remiss of me not to\r\nemphasize the need and importance of transparency and\r\naccountability in the use of United Nations funds. Of late,\r\nwe have heard of many irregularities in the administration of\r\nthis Organization’s funds, in particular funds for peace-\r\nkeeping missions. A number of proposals have been put\r\nforward by the various Member States for a review of the\r\nrules and regulations governing United Nations finances.\r\nThe time has come to set up a respectable mechanism to\r\nundertake this urgent task.\r\nAlthough the cold war is no more and old ideological\r\nempires have unravelled, the euphoria of triumphalism has\r\nbeen short-lived. There is turmoil almost everywhere as\r\nage-old nationalisms that have for so long been suppressed\r\nexplode with a vengeance that knows no limit. True to\r\ncharacter, the twentieth century will not, so it seems, fade\r\naway peacefully.\r\nThe post-cold-war era and the celebrated onset of a new\r\nworld order have thus not brought peace to our world, but\r\nmore bloodshed, instability and insecurity in many places.\r\nConsequently, there has been a rapid expansion of United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations - far beyond the capacity\r\nof the Organization’s resources to manage. There is neither\r\nthe manpower nor the financial wherewithal for the United\r\nNations to be everywhere in the magnitude of presence that\r\nis so often requested.\r\nThere is, nevertheless, every reason for us to be\r\nsatisfied with the valiant efforts which the Secretary-General\r\nand his staff have exerted to ensure that the many fires of\r\ncivil war that have become such dominant features of the\r\nso-called new world order do not engulf us all. The United\r\nNations has shown that, given the wherewithal, it can live up\r\nto what we expect of it in the realm of peacemaking and\r\npeace-keeping. Cambodia has just been saved from\r\nself-destruction. Imagine what Somalia could have become\r\nhad the United States and the United Nations not intervened\r\nto safeguard the delivery of the massive humanitarian\r\nassistance which the international community has poured into\r\nthe famished country. Even in the Balkans, where the most\r\nbrutal and senseless civil war imaginable is in progress,\r\nparticularly in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina - a\r\ncivil war that for a year and a half has been defying every\r\nsolution attempted - the United Nations has played a\r\nmitigating humanitarian role under the most difficult of\r\noperational circumstances.\r\nOn Somalia, Botswana stands firm in its support for the\r\nUnited Nations mission of mercy in that devastated country.\r\nWe condemn in the strongest terms the continued attack on\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping forces even as we deeply\r\nregret the loss of innocent Somali lives. We cannot condone\r\nthe massive loss of civilian lives in Mogadishu, though at\r\nthe same time we need to be extremely circumspect in\r\napportioning blame to one side of the conflict or the other.\r\nAn international effort to save a people is in serious\r\njeopardy. An attack on United Nations peace-keeping forces\r\nmust never be taken lightly, for it is fraught with very\r\nserious implications. The horrendous spectacle of the corpse\r\nof a United Nations peace-keeper being dragged like a\r\ngarbage bag on the streets of Mogadishu deserves all the\r\nopprobrium civilized humanity can heap on such a callous\r\nact of inhumanity. The international community must not\r\nflinch in the face of the acts of those in Mogadishu who are\r\nbent on thwarting the process of reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation in Somalia.\r\nIn many ways, the United Nations Operation in Somalia\r\n(UNOSOM) has been a success. Botswana is proud to have\r\nmade a contribution to UNOSOM, however modest.\r\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 15\r\nThe terrible civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a\r\nmonumental outrage that must shame us all as human\r\nbeings. A world that is able to tolerate scenes of tiny\r\ninnocent children being torn to pieces or maimed by\r\nshrapnel and bullets - innocent and helpless victims of a war\r\nthat makes sense only to its perpetrators - is a world without\r\na conscience. The international community must devise\r\nmore creative ways and means of dealing effectively with\r\nthat savage conflict.\r\nTo turn to our own continent, in Mozambique there is\r\nan encouraging movement towards peace and tranquility.\r\nThe situation there has stabilized enough to give us more\r\nhope than ever before that the war-ravaged sister country\r\nwill soon enjoy the beginnings of economic recovery and\r\nnational reconciliation and healing. Humanitarian relief is\r\nnow able to reach the famine-stricken. The United Nations\r\npeace-keeping force, among which is our own contingent, is\r\nprogressively moving towards full deployment and the\r\naccomplishment of its mandate. It is hoped that the many\r\ncease-fire violations thus far recorded will not sabotage the\r\npeace process.\r\nThe survival of the State and nation of Angola is in\r\nvery serious jeopardy as the senseless civil war that has been\r\nraging there since the mid-1970s has worsened and assumed\r\nthe dimensions of an unstoppable conflagration. All the\r\nefforts of the Security Council to find a lasting solution to\r\nthe civil war have come to naught as a result of Mr.\r\nSavimbi’s stubborn refusal to negotiate a peaceful end to the\r\nconflict. Unfortunately, in the face of this stubbornness on\r\nthe part of Mr. Savimbi, the world seems utterly incapable\r\nof doing anything more than calling continuously for\r\npeaceful negotiations - a call that is continuously scorned.\r\nThe international community must do more to save\r\nAngola. A terrible crime against humanity is being\r\nperpetrated against the Angolan people. We take note of the\r\nrecent announcement by UNITA that it is ready to accept the\r\nBicesse Accords and the results of the 1992 elections. The\r\nGovernment has in principle agreed to the resumption of\r\npeace talks. We hope that this time the peace talks, if they\r\ntake place, will produce the solution we have been\r\ndesperately waiting for.\r\nIn South Africa, the horizon of change is more\r\npromising than ever before. Negotiations for a new South\r\nAfrica have been torturously slow and painful, but they\r\nhave, in a stunning reversal of fortune, produced the first\r\ntangible evidence of the onset of real and meaningful\r\nchange. The legislative structures that are to underpin the\r\ntransition to the establishment of a democratic Government\r\nin the first half of next year are in place. Four bills -\r\nnamely, those regarding the Independent Election\r\nCommission, the Independent Media Commission, the\r\nIndependent Broadcasting Authority and the Transitional\r\nExecutive Council - have been adopted by the Negotiating\r\nCouncil and will soon be enacted into law, having been\r\npassed by the South African Parliament.\r\nOnce the transitional legislative package has been\r\ncompleted with the adoption of the interim constitution and\r\nthe constitutional principles and fundamental rights at present\r\nunder negotiation, the transition will officially begin with the\r\ninstallation of the Transitional Executive Council. To show\r\nthe great promise that the situation in South Africa holds\r\ntoday, I can do no better than quote Mr. Nelson Mandela’s\r\nmomentous speech of 24 September to the United Nations\r\nSpecial Committee against Apartheid. He said,\r\n\"The countdown to democracy has begun. The\r\ndate for the demise of the white minority regime has\r\nbeen determined, agreed and set\".\r\nIn its statement of 29 September 1993 the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of the Organization of African Unity on Southern\r\nAfrica concurred that enough progress had been made in the\r\npeace process in South Africa to warrant the lifting of\r\neconomic sanctions. This was a momentous decision taken\r\nby Africa in the ardent belief and hope that we are truly\r\napproaching a historic watershed in the blood-stained history\r\nof southern Africa: the end at last of the long nightmare of\r\napartheid. However, as Mr. Mandela and the Secretary\r\nGeneral of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania, Mr.\r\nBenny Alexander, have conceded, freedom is not yet there.\r\nWith all the horrific violence now ravaging the KwaZulu\r\ncountryside and the East Rand townships, in the back yard\r\nof the World Trade Centre in Johannesburg, where the\r\nnegotiations are taking place, the process does not lack\r\nenemies or detractors. There is also the unfortunate boycott\r\nof the negotiation process by some parties, whose\r\nimplications it is impossible to ascertain. Nevertheless, the\r\npeople of South Africa, more than ever before, will need\r\nand, indeed, deserve our determined companionship as they\r\nwalk the last and, possibly, the most difficult mile in their\r\njourney to the new South Africa.\r\nRegrettably, progress, if any, has been very slow in the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations plan on Western\r\nSahara. We urge the Secretary-General to continue to spare\r\nno effort to ensure that the referendum is held so that the\r\npeople of Western Sahara can at long last decide their future.\r\nBotswana is encouraged by the readiness of all parties\r\nto the Liberian conflict to honour their commitments to the\r\nYamoussoukro Accords and other subsequent peace plans.\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nWe are anxious to see the Accords implemented peacefully\r\nand in full. The Secretary- General, in his last report on the\r\nsubject (S/26422), notes that a successful implementation of\r\nthe Accords would require sufficient resources. We appeal\r\nto all Member States to be generous in their contributions to\r\nthe trust fund set up for this purpose.\r\nIt is with a sigh of relief that we welcome the adoption\r\nof Security Council resolution 872 (1993) on Rwanda. We\r\nappeal to all the parties to the conflict in Rwanda to\r\ncooperate fully with the United Nations Assistance Mission\r\nfor Rwanda (UNAMIR) in ensuring that that war-torn East\r\nAfrican sister country does not revert to the carnage that has\r\noften threatened its very existence.\r\nWe celebrate the triumph of the democratic process in\r\nthe south-eastern Asian nation of Cambodia. The shroud of\r\nmisery and death that for many years eclipsed Cambodia\r\nhas, hopefully, now been lifted, and lifted forever. We\r\ncongratulate the United Nations and the Cambodians on a\r\njob well done. 89.56 per cent of Cambodian voters,\r\nundaunted by violence and threats of violence, have spoken\r\nloud and clear that they want peace and reconciliation.\r\nIn the Middle East, the homeland of the Bible and its\r\nmiracles, we have recently witnessed a miraculous\r\nrapprochement between the Jewish people of Israel and the\r\nPalestinian people. The foundations of peace in the area\r\nhave been laid, and no effort should be spared to build on\r\nthem. No effort should be spared in making the peace\r\nprocess only just begun a just, comprehensive and lasting\r\none. Given the desperate conditions in the occupied\r\nterritories, we, the international community, have a duty to\r\nsupport and nurture the peace process by contributing\r\ngenerously to the economic reconstruction of the area to\r\nenable the Palestinians to taste the fruits of peace.\r\nWe cherish the hope that the sudden improvement of\r\nprospects for peace in the Middle East will have a catalytic\r\nand propelling effect on the quest for a workable formula for\r\nthe reunification of the island Republic of Cyprus. So long\r\nas the island remains divided, it will remain a source of\r\nconflict and instability in the area.\r\nSo it is with Korea. Botswana hopes the divided\r\npeninsula will soon realize that it has become fashionable in\r\nthis post-cold-war era for age-old problems suddenly to\r\nbecome amenable to solution. Change - peaceful change -\r\nthrough negotiation is the imperative of our time.\r\nIn Central America, after many years of conflict, El\r\nSalvador is finally at peace. We hope that the proven\r\ncapacity and efficacy of the United Nations in the field of\r\nelection-monitoring and supervision will again be put to\r\ngood use in El Salvador’s March 1994 election.\r\nIn Haiti, we look forward to the imminent restoration\r\nof the presidency of Father Aristide. The success of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of American States in\r\nshaping the agreement deserves our commendation.\r\nBotswana, a country whose respect for human rights is\r\nsecond to none, supports fully the creation of a post of\r\ncommissioner of human rights. We have no human rights\r\nabuses to hide, nor do we fear criticism - constructive\r\ncriticism, that is - should the international community find\r\nsome aspect of our domestic policy or policies to be\r\nincompatible with the enjoyment of human rights by our\r\ncitizens. This is not an invitation to interference in our\r\ninternal affairs. We have always maintained that no nation\r\nhas the right to violate the basic human rights of its citizens\r\nwhile using Article 2 (7) of the Charter as an argument\r\nagainst intervention by the international community.\r\nRecent reports have revealed that the United Nations is\r\nspending roughly three times as much on peace-keeping and\r\npeacemaking as on development assistance. Problems of\r\ndevelopment, as should be clear to everybody, constitute the\r\nunderlying cause of world conflicts, and for the United\r\nNations to be effective in the maintenance of international\r\npeace, more energy and resources have to be expended on\r\ndevelopment activities.\r\nOf particular concern are the downward trend in\r\nAfrica’s commodity prices, the debt burden and the\r\nshrinking aid flow. In addition, many African countries,\r\nincluding my own, have had to cope with the serious effects\r\nof drought and famine. The civil strife which many African\r\ncountries have had to cope with have also had a crippling\r\neffect on economic activity through damage to infrastructure.\r\nIn order for an effective process of development to get\r\nunder way in Africa the international community needs to\r\nestablish a more open trading system giving access to, and\r\nadequate compensation for, commodities produced in Africa.\r\nFor the past several years the market share for African goods\r\nhas experienced a dramatic decline. Botswana appeals for\r\na speedy conclusion of the current Uruguay Round of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations, which we believe will\r\nstrengthen Africa’s trading capacity and allow unrestricted\r\naccess of our commodities to the world markets.\r\nThe debt burden continues to be a major obstacle to\r\nAfrican economic growth and development. Clearly,\r\nnecessary measures have not been taken to attend to this\r\ncompounding problem. The time has come for the donor\r\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 17\r\ncommunity and the multilateral financial institutions to heed\r\nAfrica’s call to reduce or totally cancel the debt stock.\r\nWe live in exciting times, exciting in both positive and\r\nnegative ways. We have been fortunate to wake up from the\r\nlong nightmare of the cold war and bear witness to the birth\r\nof a new world, however imperfect. The birth of any new\r\nepoch has never been easy or free of pain. The membership\r\nof the Organization has multiplied with the rapid emergence\r\nof new nations, whose aspirations for self-determination had\r\nfor so long been frustrated.\r\nThe import of this most welcome development is, of\r\ncourse, not simply that we are close to universality but, also,\r\nthat the problems facing the Organization have multiplied.\r\nThankfully, our rejuvenated United Nations seems to have\r\nborne this increased load of responsibilities with a great deal\r\nof enthusiasm. Botswana renews its faith in this rejuvenated\r\nUnited Nations and in its time-tested Charter.\r\nMr. TAVERAS GUZMAN (Dominican Republic)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): The delegation of the\r\nDominican Republic takes great pleasure in extending its\r\nwarmest congratulations to Mr. Samuel Insanally on his\r\nwell-merited election to preside over the General Assembly\r\nat this forty-eighth session. A man from our America - and,\r\nmore specifically, from the Caribbean region, where both of\r\nour countries are located - he has the required abilities and\r\nexperience successfully to guide our work at this session,\r\nwhich must confront and deal with the major challenges\r\nfacing the international community, namely, the achievement\r\nof peace and the economic and social development of our\r\nnations.\r\nWe also wish to express our appreciation to the\r\noutgoing President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the wisdom with\r\nwhich he led our deliberations at the previous session.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend our\r\nthanks to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his commitment and for his\r\nefforts to carry out the principles and purposes of the\r\nOrganization’s Charter.\r\nToday, in our America, we are witnessing the\r\nbeginnings of a negotiated solution to conflict, and we are\r\npleased that in Central America, and particularly in El\r\nSalvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, the disputes that have\r\ndisturbed the peace and hindered the development of our\r\npeoples are now being resolved at the negotiating table. In\r\nour Island of Hispaniola, imperial and colonial rivalry\r\ndivided the population into two peoples who, over the course\r\nof time, established two independent States - the Dominican\r\nRepublic, which we represent here, and the Republic of\r\nHaiti. The efforts being made by the Haitian people and\r\ntheir leaders, with international assistance in the form of\r\nnegotiations under the aegis of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States, are now beginning to bear\r\nfruit and will, we trust, restore normalcy to that fraternal\r\ncountry with the re-establishment of constitutional order.\r\nIn that connection our delegation reiterates its appeal to\r\nthe international community to lend real assistance to\r\nstabilize the democratic regime and to ensure the economic\r\nreconstruction of Haiti - assistance and cooperation adequate\r\nto meet the needs of peace and employment. The\r\nDominican Republic, in so far as it is able, remains ready to\r\ncontinue to cooperate with this fraternal people to lighten the\r\nheavy burden of its current problems.\r\nIn this respect, we are pleased to report that the Prime\r\nMinister of the Haitian Government, Mr. Robert Malval,\r\nrecently made an official visit to the Dominican Republic,\r\nwith a view to fully normalizing relations between the\r\nDominican and Haitian peoples and establishing the full\r\nspectrum of relations between the two countries, in their\r\nmutual interest. I am happy to say that the Haitian Prime\r\nMinister was given a very warm welcome by the President\r\nof the Dominican Republic, Mr. Joaquín Balaguer, who has\r\nalways been interested in finding a solution to our brother\r\ncountry’s political conflict and especially in alleviating the\r\nserious economic situation there. As a result of the meeting,\r\nthe two statesmen reached an agreement, subsequently\r\nformalized, that will ensure the speedy and constructive\r\nnormalization of relations, with real reciprocal cooperation,\r\nbetween our two States.\r\nThere is no more appropriate forum than this for me,\r\non behalf of my country and Government, to appeal again\r\nfor massive aid from the most developed nations of the\r\nEarth to that afflicted and impoverished neighbouring brother\r\ncountry.\r\nSince the conquest and colonization of America, the\r\nDominican Republic has defended human rights. It was in\r\nour island, Hispaniola, that a loud voice was first raised on\r\nbehalf of the rights of the indigenous inhabitants of our\r\nAmerican lands - the voice of Brother Antón de Montesinos,\r\nin his famous Advent sermon. Faithful to that first call for\r\nthe redemption of our continent, our Government honours\r\nthis historical tradition, which is fully valid today in our\r\ncountry’s official and private practice. It has been working\r\non instruments - which might eventually become\r\ninternational in nature - that will contribute to giving\r\njuridical force to that tradition.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nOur country has advocated the universality of human\r\nrights. We believe that neither geographical, economic,\r\nsocial, religious nor cultural differences can ever be used as\r\na pretext for showing contempt for human rights.\r\nThe Dominican delegation believes that, because of the\r\nincrease in the membership of the United Nations - currently\r\nat 184 countries - there should be a more equitable\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council, while at the same\r\ntime we continue to abide by the provisions of paragraph 1\r\nof Article 23 of the United Nations Charter. Now that the\r\nbipolarity of the past has disappeared and the use and abuse\r\nof the veto are fading, the Council should become more\r\nrepresentative of the new international reality. This should\r\nbe done in broad consultations, after due reflection and with\r\naccount taken of the need for equity, so that the Council can\r\nbecome more representative without its effectiveness being\r\nin any way mitigated or weakened. Rather, its authority and\r\nresponsibility will be enhanced so that it can respond\r\neffectively to any crisis with which the international\r\ncommunity might be confronted, as the Council has done\r\nrecently. In this regard, we consider that it would be\r\npractical and feasible to give the Council greater flexibility\r\nin meeting the just aspirations of nations, such as the\r\nRepublic of China, that wish to become Members of the\r\nUnited Nations and cooperate in carrying out its principles.\r\nI would now like to express our views on developments\r\nin the international situation, particularly on conflicts that, in\r\none way or another, have been affecting international peace.\r\nI shall refer first to the Central American crisis, which,\r\nhappily, today is on the road to a definitive solution because\r\nof the positive evolution, under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, of the El Salvador peace agreements, and the recent\r\nreturn to democracy in Guatemala, which augurs well for the\r\ninstitutionalization of peace and prosperity in that region.\r\nNext, we would like to refer to one of the most\r\ncomplex and difficult conflicts facing the international\r\ncommunity today - that is, the existence of extreme\r\nnationalism, which in some cases has led to fratricidal wars\r\nand the annihilation of large groups of people because of\r\nracial and cultural hatred. This has happened in the former\r\nYugoslavia, where even now, despite the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations and intensive diplomatic activity, blood is\r\nstill being shed between brother peoples that until recently\r\nlived together under one flag. Our Government wishes to\r\nsee a swift solution to the situation in the former Yugoslavia\r\nand reiterates its support for measures taken by the Security\r\nCouncil, in particular the establishment of an international\r\nwar tribunal to pass judgement on crimes against humanity\r\ncommitted in some areas of the conflict.\r\nWe would especially like to point to one positive\r\ndevelopment that represents perhaps our best hope for peace\r\ntoday: the transitional agreement between the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and the Government of the\r\nState of Israel. The long-standing conflict in the Middle\r\nEast engendered dangerous tension that has kept the entire\r\nworld in suspense and has been regarded as the potential\r\nsource of a future conflagration of incalculable\r\ndestructiveness.\r\nIn connection with the development to which I have\r\njust referred - the agreement between the Palestinians and\r\nthe State of Israel - it might be time to defer consideration\r\nof or remove the items on that conflict that have long\r\nappeared on the General Assembly’s agenda. With this\r\nreciprocal exchange of olive branches of peace, we can see\r\nthe promise of harmony between peoples that have been\r\nliving in such uneasy proximity.\r\nWe must recognize how the persistent diplomacy of the\r\nUnited States contributed to securing the results that have\r\nbeen achieved. The United States considered the situation\r\nwith a view to deciding what was possible in relations\r\nbetween the Arab and Jewish peoples. The agreement\r\nculminated in the signing at the White House in Washington.\r\nIn our opinion, that demonstrated unequivocally and very\r\nclearly to international public opinion the sincerity of the\r\nparties, who were fully aware of the extreme importance of\r\nthe commitments into which they were entering.\r\nWe must constantly stress the importance of the\r\nenvironment. After economic crisis and the imbalance\r\nbetween North and South, the major challenge facing\r\nmankind is the environmental crisis. The gradual destruction\r\nof ecosystems and the deteriorating quality of life of human\r\nbeings are unavoidable aspects of everyday existence for the\r\npeoples of the world. Thus, it is essential that the course of\r\nevents be changed. The political will of Governments and\r\nof all those who participate in organized civilian society will\r\nbe necessary to our taking up this great challenge, which\r\nwill involve commitment on the part of everyone - a\r\ncommitment from all mankind.\r\nIn that connection, the Dominican Republic supports the\r\ngeneral outline of the Plan of Action that was adopted at the\r\nsummit Conference on Environment and Development in Rio\r\nde Janeiro in 1992. Here we have a valuable instrument for\r\npolitical programming and regional cooperation to protect the\r\nenvironment in Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nThe latter part of the twentieth century has witnessed\r\nmajor changes in world political affairs, ranging from the\r\nend of the cold war to democratization in the countries of\r\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 19\r\nEastern Europe.Despite this ideological thaw, however, we\r\nstill have arms trafficking and nuclear arsenals and,\r\ntherefore, a serious threat to peace.\r\nLet me refer once again to the situation in the Korean\r\npeninsula and mention specifically North Korea, which is\r\ncontinuing its nuclear research and investing enormous\r\nresources in this undertaking. Let us invite the Government\r\nof North Korea to become a party to the universal\r\nagreements on the control of nuclear weapons. Let us invite\r\nit to cooperate transparently and effectively with the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in that body’s\r\nimportant task of inspecting and monitoring nuclear\r\nfacilities. Willingness to do so would constitute evidence of\r\nthat Government’s respect for its own nation and of its\r\nconcern for the future of its people and of all mankind.\r\nWe support United Nations measures to put an end to\r\narms trafficking. We support efforts to ensure transparency\r\nin military expenditures so that military activity may be\r\nmade more predictable, and peace and international security,\r\nat the regional and world levels, strengthened.\r\nLet me now turn to two important issues that are still\r\non the agenda of this Assembly.\r\nMay I, first, draw the attention of the international\r\ncommunity, as represented here, to the positive\r\ndevelopments in the area of drug trafficking, which are due\r\nto the success of many measures aimed at combating and\r\neradicating what has for too long been one of the most\r\nominous scourges of mankind. None the less, we must\r\nredouble our efforts to ensure that measures are implemented\r\nboth internally and internationally and result from\r\ncoordinated policies of all the nations represented here today.\r\nThe Dominican Republic has just become a party to the\r\n1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in\r\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and the 1972\r\nProtocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic\r\nDrugs of 1961, bringing itself up to date on international\r\nlegislation in order the better to play its role in collaborating\r\nwith other States and agencies.\r\nThe other issue to which I wish to refer is the economic\r\ncrisis affecting most countries of the world. Today, the\r\nphenomenon of globalization of the economy and integration\r\nof regional blocs is typical of the international situation,\r\nwhich is evolving so rapidly that countries such as mine can\r\nno longer put off negotiations to determine their participation\r\nin multilateral free-trade agreements, customs unions or\r\nregional markets.\r\nIn this connection, the international activities of the\r\nDominican Republic focus on the economic programmes of\r\ncountries in our region and regional organizations that can\r\nhelp in our development and in our enjoyment of technical\r\nand financial cooperation.\r\nThe implementation of appropriate domestic policies by\r\nour Government will ensure that trade and investment will\r\nbecome the ideal means to strengthen bilateral relations,\r\nunderpinned, of course, by the unilateral granting of trade\r\nbenefits under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and by the\r\nopening up of our market under the Americas Initiative.\r\nIn the new international order, another of the major\r\nchallenges that the Dominican Republic must face is the\r\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and its\r\npossible implications; we understand that NAFTA, as a\r\ntheoretical possible outcome, would imply an effort towards\r\nthe complete liberalization of trade throughout the\r\nhemisphere.\r\nI should like to emphasize the Dominican Republic’s\r\nstrong support for holding a World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment to take up matters relating to the social\r\nsituation in the world, particularly that of women, young\r\npeople, the elderly, the handicapped and families. The\r\nSummit will have to deliver a clear undertaking for common\r\npolicies to defend and protect these important segments of\r\nthe world’s population collectively, and we hope that many\r\nof our countries will take measures to extend coverage and\r\nprotection for these social sectors, especially for children and\r\nthe elderly.\r\nWe should like to draw to members’ attention a subject\r\nof serious concern to my Government and country, and that\r\nhas complex and serious ramifications that will be brought\r\nbefore the appropriate forums during the forty-eighth\r\nGeneral Assembly session. This is the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal to merge the International Research and Training\r\nInstitute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) with\r\nthe United Nations Development Fund for Women\r\n(UNIFEM). Theoretically, the General Assembly will study\r\nthis proposal in November.\r\nMy Government attaches the greatest importance to this\r\ndecision, and requests this world forum to give it its closest\r\nattention in order to avoid committing a grave injustice by\r\ntaking hasty action or the like.\r\nINSTRAW was conceived at the First World\r\nConference on Women, held in Mexico City in 1975, and\r\nwas established as the result of a series of resolutions,\r\nincluding, we should like to recall, Economic and Social\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nCouncil resolution 1979/11 of 9 May 1979. This resolution\r\nspecified clearly that the permanent headquarters of the\r\nInstitute was to be my country, the Dominican Republic, a\r\ndeveloping country.\r\nMoreover, my Government gave the United Nations the\r\nbuilding that is being used as the Institute’s headquarters.\r\nNot only that, it had to make significant investments in\r\nterms of money and other resources in order to overhaul the\r\nbuilding to bring it up to the specifications required by the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe request the Secretary-General to postpone any\r\naction leading to merger between INSTRAW and UNIFEM\r\nuntil such time as the General Assembly considers his\r\nproposal and comes to its own conclusions on the matter.\r\nAlso, it would seem that there is an attempt being made\r\nto ignore, unilaterally, the Agreement between the United\r\nNations and the host Government that is the legal framework\r\nwithin which INSTRAW operates. My Government regards\r\nthis as a serious - an extremely serious - impropriety, and\r\nreserves the right to use all relevant legal means to assert its\r\nlegitimate rights.\r\nFinally, the delegation I lead calls upon the consciences\r\nof all nations and on all those leaders who bear upon their\r\nshoulders responsibility for the destiny of their countries and\r\nthe world, for peace, common sense and mutual respect to\r\nprevail over violence and for there to be cooperation and\r\nsolidarity between peoples; for these are the supreme\r\npurposes of this Organization.\r\nMr. ARSALA (Afghanistan): Permit me, first of all, to\r\ncongratulate Ambassador Insanally on his unanimous\r\nelection as President of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am confident that,\r\nunder his dynamic and wise leadership, coupled with the\r\nsupport of that able and consummate diplomat, His\r\nExcellency Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General of\r\nthe United Nations, the deliberations of this Assembly will\r\nproduce constructive and fruitful results in meeting some of\r\nthe major challenges our world is facing at this time and in\r\nlaying a sound foundation for international relations in the\r\nforeseeable future.\r\nOur appreciation is also extended to His Excellency\r\nStoyan Ganev, the President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-seventh session, for his successful conduct of that\r\nsession of the Assembly.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to welcome\r\nthe new Member States that have joined us. I expect that\r\ntheir participation at this session will contribute significantly\r\nto international peace and cooperation.\r\nThe world has witnessed phenomenal changes within\r\nthe last two or three years. With the collapse of Soviet\r\ncommunism, many new independent States have emerged,\r\nand several countries whose citizens lived unwillingly behind\r\nthe Iron Curtain for almost half a century have rejoined the\r\nfree world. The bipolar world has disappeared and the cold\r\nwar has practically ended. These great changes provide an\r\nopportunity for us to reduce international tensions, to attain\r\ntrue parity among nations, to put an end to wasteful\r\ninvestments in destructive and devastating armaments and to\r\nfree up our resources for more productive use by all our\r\ncitizens.\r\nOn the other hand, however, we also see that these\r\nchanges in the world have created substantial uncertainties\r\nand in many instances have given rise to extremely tragic\r\nregional, local, ethnic and religious conflicts which, unless\r\naddressed by the international community, will endanger\r\nworld peace. These conflicts, combined with the continuing\r\nproblems of poverty, the widening gap between the rich and\r\nthe poor, and the scourge of drug use and drug trafficking\r\ncould offset the advantages we all hope to gain from the\r\nrecent changes. Do we have the vision, the creativity and\r\nthe resolve to ensure that the world takes positive advantage\r\nof the new realities for the benefit of all countries and\r\npeoples? Or will we continue to be myopic, dogmatically\r\nblind and self-centred, and risk losing this great opportunity?\r\nThe Afghan people have a special stake in the choice\r\nwe collectively make. We wish to ensure that our choice is\r\nthe right one and that all countries, including Afghanistan,\r\nshare fully in the benefits that should flow from the new\r\nrealities. Our special stake is based on our belief that the\r\nchanges that have taken place in the world are partly the\r\nresult of the enormous sacrifices made by our nation during\r\nthe 14 years of struggle against Soviet occupation and\r\ncommunist rule.\r\nIn this context, I would like to say a few words about\r\nsome of the issues confronting the world community today,\r\nissues which we must address in this Assembly. I will then\r\ndiscuss the situation in Afghanistan and state what our\r\nexpectations are of the United Nations and the world\r\ncommunity.\r\nOne of the issues confronting us is that of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. The country’s situation is indeed tragic, and\r\nwill be a test case to determine whether we in the\r\ninternational community have the sense of justice and can\r\nmuster the resolve to end this tragedy successfully and\r\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 21\r\njustly. The continuing occupation of Bosnian Muslim\r\nterritories by the Serbs, backed by the armed might of\r\nSerbia, the intransigence of the Serbians vis-à-vis the\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, and the untold atrocities\r\ncommitted against the innocent Bosnian Muslim population\r\nis not only an affront to this Organization but also an insult\r\nto humanity. The delegation of the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan believes that aggression must not be rewarded\r\nand that any territorial gains that were made as a result of\r\nforce should and must be rectified. A definitive time limit\r\nshould be set by which the Serbs should agree to the terms\r\nof the London Conference and withdraw from the seized\r\nterritories. Otherwise, the current arms embargo against\r\nBosnia should be lifted and other urgent and effective\r\nmeasures, including the use of force, should be considered\r\nby the United Nations and the international community to\r\nensure that the Bosnian tragedy is ended and the Serbian\r\naggression repulsed.\r\nThe Palestinian people have suffered long. The Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan would like to see peace finally achieved\r\nfor these people in a way that meets their national objectives\r\nand satisfies their right to self-determination. We believe\r\nthat the declaration of principles on Palestinian self-rule\r\nsigned in Washington on 13 September 1993 will serve as\r\nthe basis for a long-term solution to the Palestine problem\r\nand ensure peace and stability only if it is followed by\r\nearnest negotiations that lead first, to the withdrawal of\r\nIsraeli forces from the occupied territories; secondly, to the\r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State that\r\nincludes the Holy City of Jerusalem, one of the three most\r\nsacred cities of the Islamic world; thirdly, to the return of\r\nthe Palestinian refugees; and fourthly, to a resolution of the\r\nproblem of Israeli settlements in a manner acceptable to the\r\nnew Palestinian State.\r\nKashmir is another tragic issue that requires urgent\r\nattention. This issue has not only caused substantial\r\nsuffering to the people of Kashmir, but has become the\r\nsource of friction between two important neighbouring States\r\nin South Asia and has prevented the full realization of the\r\neconomic and trade potentials that exist within and outside\r\nthe region. The Islamic State of Afghanistan therefore urges\r\nthe resolution of this issue by these two States through\r\nnegotiations under United Nations auspices or under any\r\nother arrangements that may be acceptable to both sides,\r\ntaking into account the wishes and aspirations of the people\r\nof Kashmir.\r\nIn the case of Somalia, the Islamic State of Afghanistan\r\nis distressed by the chaos which has resulted from increasing\r\ncivil upheaval. We support the peace-keeping efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations and hope that international participation can\r\nensure a safe end to the turmoil in Somalia and the\r\nestablishment of a viable government to protect the interests\r\nand rights of the Somali people. We believe all peaceful\r\navenues that might help in solving this problem should be\r\nexplored.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan supports every\r\nequitable international effort to prevent the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons. However, given that most of the tragedies\r\naround the world are caused by the massive increase in the\r\navailability of conventional weapons, my delegation would\r\nwelcome and support a resolution to control the production\r\nand sale of such weapons. Such a resolution should also\r\nprovide for effective arms collection programmes in\r\ncountries which are saturated with weapons that are causing\r\ninternal and regional instability.\r\nNow I would like to focus the attention of the\r\nAssembly on my own country, Afghanistan. As all of you\r\nknow, Afghanistan has suffered enormously within the past\r\n15 years. I do not wish to go into the details of the\r\ndestruction that has taken place, but I would like to highlight\r\na few points very briefly.\r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has\r\naptly summarized the tragedy of Afghanistan:\r\n\"Few countries in history have suffered to the\r\nextent Afghanistan has over the past fourteen years.\r\nAside from the physical destruction, which was often\r\nnothing short of cataclysmic, the results of the war\r\ninclude well over a million people killed, over 2 million\r\ndisabled, nearly 6 million refugees in neighbouring\r\ncountries, and 2 million internally displaced persons.\"\r\nAlmost the entire transportation, communication, and\r\npower infrastructure in Afghanistan has been either wiped\r\nout or severely damaged. The agricultural system is in total\r\ndisarray, with the irrigation system destroyed, much\r\nlivestock killed and the agricultural credit and extension\r\nservices totally defunct. The placement of millions of mines\r\nthroughout the country makes it impossible to revive the\r\nagricultural sector. Forests are denuded and the environment\r\nspoiled. Attempts to provide health care, medicine,\r\nimmunization and so on are stymied by the destruction of so\r\nmany hospitals and clinics. Mental health problems resulting\r\nfrom many years of war and bombings have no relief. In\r\naddition, thousands upon thousands of amputees require\r\nartificial limbs. Thousands of schools have been destroyed\r\nand many of our teachers and professors have been killed or\r\nexiled. Indeed, illiteracy has overtaken almost our entire\r\npopulation. A whole generation of Afghans has no\r\nexperience of normal life or of education in any form.\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe other two urgent problems we have are both linked\r\nto the lack of jobs and of economic alternatives within\r\nAfghanistan: the problem of large numbers of weapons in\r\nprivate hands and the problem of illicit drugs. I shall return\r\nto both of these matters a little later.\r\nLet me describe the plight of one individual, Abdul\r\nRahim. This man escaped to Pakistan from the war in\r\nAfghanistan nine years ago. He was newly married, with\r\none baby, and during his years in Pakistan he had two more\r\nchildren. Two of his brothers were killed in battle, and the\r\nthird died of disease that went untreated because of poor\r\nmedical facilities. He is responsible for two of his widowed\r\nsisters-in-law and their five children. Thus, as he returns to\r\nhis village in Afghanistan he is the head of a family of\r\ntwelve. He finds that his parents, who had refused to leave,\r\nare no longer there. It will be some time before he learns of\r\ntheir fate. His home is reduced to a pile of rubble, as,\r\nobviously, are those of his neighbours. The shops of the\r\nvillage are gone. The once-paved road that came almost to\r\nthe village is an unrecognizable path of dust and rocks.\r\nThere is no water and no electricity. Worse, there are no\r\ntrees or source of wood, and winter’s shadow grows longer\r\nwith each cold night. In his once productive fields lie\r\nburned tanks and odd pieces of metallic rubble. His cousins\r\nnervously talk of land mines, one of which killed an old\r\nneighbour the day before his return. His family is concerned\r\nabout lack of flour, tea and sugar. This person is just an\r\nexample; there are millions of people like him in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nOne of the most damaging legacies that Afghanistan\r\nhas inherited from Soviet occupation, Communist rule and\r\nthe long, drawn-out war is a substantial break-up of our civil\r\nand military administration and the virtual collapse of our\r\neconomic and financial institutions. In the past year the\r\nGovernment has taken substantial steps to correct the\r\nsituation. Indeed, progress has been made in re-establishing\r\ncentral authority and in reviving public and private economic\r\nand financial institutions. None the less, considerable work\r\nand much assistance will be required before we begin to\r\novercome those shortcomings.\r\nIn addition, given the destruction that has taken place,\r\nwe are in need of a massive reconstruction programme\r\nwhich we are unable to undertake unless we are assisted by\r\nthe international community. Last year the General\r\nAssembly adopted a resolution calling for reconstruction\r\nassistance to Afghanistan. Not much has happened since\r\nthen. A similar draft resolution will be presented to the\r\nAssembly this year, and we hope that it will be supported\r\nand that many can take part in putting it into effect.\r\nWhen we raise the question of assistance for\r\nreconstruction and revitalization of the economy, our request\r\nis gently dismissed with the reply that once security is\r\nestablished, Afghanistan will be helped. While granting that\r\nsecurity is important for a full-fledged reconstruction\r\nprogramme, I would suggest that a reasonable degree of\r\npeace and security does exist in large parts of Afghanistan.\r\nIn these areas reconstruction is possible and, if started, could\r\nserve as a catalyst in revitalizing the entire Afghan economy.\r\nThere are only a few areas where tensions exist and where\r\nthere may be intermittent fighting. We should also bear in\r\nmind that it may not be possible to have full peace and\r\nsecurity in the country unless we are able to start the process\r\nof reconstruction and provide people with productive\r\neconomic opportunities to make it attractive, and indeed\r\npossible, for them to give up their arms. The vicious circle\r\nof security first and then reconstruction or economic revival\r\nfirst and then security must be broken if we are to make any\r\nprogress.\r\nAnother dimension of security is obviously political.\r\nTo ensure that the entire Afghan nation participates in\r\ndetermining the country’s future political structure, we plan\r\nto hold elections in the course of the coming year. We have\r\ntherefore requested the United Nations to help organize and\r\nsupervise the election process.\r\nNow I should like to come back to the two or three\r\npoints which I mentioned earlier.\r\nOne issue worth mentioning here and which has had\r\nboth regional and international implications is that of\r\nnarcotic drugs. At the present time the illicit cultivation,\r\nproduction, stocking, smuggling of and trafficking in narcotic\r\ndrugs are without a doubt critical problems that face\r\nhumanity. Regrettably, one of the legacies of the long war\r\nis the transformation of some parts of our country into\r\nstaging areas for illicit drug activity. This phenomenon,\r\nwhich is the result of the unavailability of economic\r\nalternatives, is a source of great pain to us. The Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan, despite its scarce resources, has\r\nundertaken serious measures in the struggle against illicit\r\ndrugs. We shall spare no efforts in combating these illegal\r\nactivities. However, we must not overlook the reality that\r\nAfghanistan, with its extremely limited means and massive\r\neconomic and financial needs, is not in a position to\r\naccomplish effectively this task on its own. Afghanistan\r\nneeds urgent support from the international community to\r\nintensify the struggle against cultivation and of trafficking in\r\ndrugs.\r\nAnother area where we require cooperation is that of\r\nland mines. Last year the Secretary-General’s report brought\r\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 23\r\nto the attention of the world the fact that there are more than\r\n10 million land mines in Afghanistan. It should also be\r\nmentioned that, on average, about 300 people fall victim to\r\nland mines each month. The agricultural sector, the\r\ntraditional base of the Afghan economy, will never be\r\nrevived until these mines are cleared. We of course express\r\nour gratitude for the past and ongoing mine-clearing\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations and experts from other\r\ncountries. However, there is an urgent need for greater\r\nassistance by interested countries both in actual\r\nmine-clearing operations and in training Afghan citizens so\r\nas to enable us to complete this task in as short a time as\r\npossible. In this connection, the delegation of the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan wholeheartedly supports the new item,\r\nintroduced by the European Community, on the current\r\nagenda of the General Assembly concerning mine-clearing\r\nprogrammes for war-stricken countries.\r\nWe Afghans want to reconstruct our country and to\r\nheal the wounds of the war that was imposed upon us. We\r\nlook forward to a normal life in which all our citizens\r\nparticipate fully in the political, economic, and social life of\r\nthe country, without any prejudice and without\r\ndiscrimination based on ethnicity, religious sect, language or\r\ngender. Here we consider it particularly important that\r\nAfghan women play an effective and positive role in the\r\nprocess of rebuilding Afghanistan. We want to raise the\r\nstandard of living of our people. We want to live in peace\r\nwith all our neighbours and to cooperate fully with them so\r\nthat we can use the vast resources of our region to the\r\nmaximum advantage of all our peoples. Indeed, we want to\r\nserve as a transit and trade route in our region. To this end,\r\nthe Islamic State of Afghanistan intends to devise a\r\nreconstruction and development strategy that takes into\r\naccount not only Afghanistan’s own requirements, but also\r\nthe requirements of the region.\r\nWe are of course distressed by the recent upheavals in\r\nTajikistan. We have made every effort to ensure that\r\ntensions along the Tajik-Afghan border are reduced. For this\r\npurpose, official visits at the highest levels have been\r\nexchanged between the two countries. These visits have\r\nresulted in mutual understanding on important issues.\r\nAppropriate communiqués to this effect have been issued in\r\nKabul and Dushanbe. We welcome the decision of the Tajik\r\nauthorities to solve their internal political problems through\r\nnegotiations so that the Tajik refugees now in Afghanistan\r\ncan return to Tajikistan voluntarily with confidence, in\r\nsecurity and with honour, in accordance with international\r\nnorms. To this end we are planning to reach a trilateral\r\nagreement between Afghanistan, Tajikistan and the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan stands firm in support\r\nof human rights. This we consider not only an international\r\ncommitment, but also a religious conviction. The fact that\r\nafter the collapse of the communist regime in Afghanistan\r\nand the takeover by the Mujahideen, no policy of revenge\r\nagainst the former regime members was pursued is a good\r\nindication of this commitment. It is true, however, that due\r\nto the massive number of weapons now in private hands in\r\nour country some individual incidents of human rights\r\nviolations have taken place, and skirmishes between different\r\narmed groups have regrettably led to the loss of innocent\r\nlives. Therefore, the Islamic State of Afghanistan is taking\r\nmeasures to collect heavy arms from various armed groups.\r\nWe seriously hope that these efforts will bear fruit in the not\r\ntoo distant future.\r\nI also want to make it clear that, having been the\r\nvictims of terrorism ourselves, the Afghan nation opposes\r\nterrorism in any form or shape. We will never tolerate\r\nterrorism or allow Afghan territory to be used for such acts.\r\nTerrorism and the killing of innocent people is abhorrent to\r\nour religious beliefs and to our traditions. God Almighty\r\ncondemns the killing of innocent people and says that when\r\nanyone kills an innocent person, it will\r\n\"be as if He slew the whole people\". (The Holy Koran,\r\nV:35).\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe world is also witness to the fact that throughout the\r\nunequal war against the former Soviet Union the Afghans at\r\nno point carried out any acts of terrorism against Soviet\r\ncitizens or Soviet property.\r\nI would like to conclude by stating that the international\r\ncommunity will draw maximum advantage from the changes\r\nthat have taken place in the world if we assume\r\nresponsibility for, and become committed to, working\r\ncollectively towards improving the lives of all peoples, while\r\neach country maintains its full independence and enjoys\r\nequal rights and privileges as a separate nation. All\r\ncountries represented in this body should be thinking not\r\nonly of the prevention of conflicts, but also of engaging our\r\nenergies to uplift the economic, social, and political lives of\r\nevery nation and citizen so that all are safe, secure and free.\r\nIt is with such vision, such commitment, such sense of\r\nsharing, that we will be able to realize the objectives for\r\nwhich this Organization was founded. For the attainment of\r\nthese goals, we must ensure that new opportunities in the\r\nworld are not wasted and that the sacrifices of millions of\r\npeople who gave their lives for freedom and dignity, as well\r\nas the silent suffering of those who despaired under years of\r\npoverty and oppression, were not in vain.\r\nFor our part, I would like to assure the Organization\r\nand the international community that Afghanistan will be a\r\nfull and cooperative partner in all constructive collective\r\nefforts aimed at ensuring international peace, stability,\r\nprogress, freedom and justice.\r\nMay God bless everyone present and help us all in our\r\nefforts.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1:30 p.m.\r\n"
