"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n26th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nTuesday, 12 October 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.35 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMrs. des Iles (Trinidad and Tobago): It is with\r\nimmense pride that I congratulate you, Sir, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Trinidad and Tobago, on your\r\nunanimous election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. Your election to this\r\nimportant position is a tribute to the active and constructive\r\nrole played by Guyana in international affairs over the years.\r\nIt is also a tribute to your own personal integrity and\r\ndiplomatic acumen. As a fellow representative of a member\r\nState of the Caribbean Community, I am confident that you\r\nwill bring to the deliberations ahead the necessary measure\r\nof impartiality and astuteness that will be indispensable in\r\nreconciling the differing views on the many complex issues\r\nbefore us.\r\nMy delegation joins in welcoming the six newest\r\nMembers admitted into this family of nations in 1993:\r\nAndorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Slovak\r\nRepublic and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nThese new Members, all of which are relatively small, can\r\ndraw some inspiration from the election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly of a representative from Guyana, the\r\nsmallest developing country in terms of population, ever to\r\nassume that position. For indeed, small States must continue\r\nto be afforded every opportunity to be full and active\r\ncontributors to the collective search for peace, security and\r\neconomic and social advancement for all.\r\nAll States, particularly the more vulnerable among us,\r\ncan derive much hope and encouragement from the\r\ndevelopments of September 1993, which set the course for\r\na new relationship between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and improved prospects for peace in\r\nthe Middle East. The historic exchange of letters of\r\nrecognition between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and\r\nChairman Yasser Arafat, and the subsequent signing of the\r\nPalestinian-Israeli agreement, which extends limited interim\r\nself-government to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and in\r\nJericho in the West Bank, constitute a momentous\r\ndevelopment in the turbulent and violent history of the\r\nregion.\r\nWho among us could have anticipated that, in the midst\r\nof current growing tensions and conflicts worldwide, such\r\nsworn enemies in the perennial theatre of conflict in the\r\nMiddle East would have conceded so much in the pursuit of\r\na better future? In today’s troubled times, these bold\r\npartners in peace have renewed the faith of many the world\r\nover in the capacity of diplomacy, political will and\r\nenlightened self-interest to overcome decades of hatred,\r\nmistrust and fear. We all recognize the tremendous\r\ndifficulties and challenges ahead. Trinidad and Tobago\r\nwishes these leaders well and urges active United Nations\r\ninvolvement in assisting all parties concerned in a smooth\r\ntransition from a state of belligerence to one of cooperation\r\nand peaceful co-existence. Given the centrality of the\r\nPalestinian question to the conflict in the Middle East, all\r\nparties need to work indefatigably to translate this initial\r\nsuccess into a comprehensive and durable peace for the\r\nregion.\r\nA similar concerted response on the part of the United\r\nNations and the international community will be imperative\r\nin assisting the people of South Africa in their transition to\r\na united, democratic, non-racial South Africa. After more\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86849 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.26\r\n1 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthan 45 years of anguished attention to the despair, suffering\r\nand injustice in that country, the provision of token measures\r\nof assistance would be unacceptable.\r\nIf the world is to give any credence to the United\r\nNations new thrust towards post-conflict peace-building, a\r\ntangible commitment to the success of the transition in South\r\nAfrica needs to be made. We therefore join the call for an\r\nenhanced United Nations presence in South Africa, a\r\npresence that is urgently needed prior to the elections of\r\nApril 1994. Trinidad and Tobago is taking the necessary\r\nsteps to implement the decision taken on 8 October by the\r\nAssembly to lift economic sanctions against South Africa\r\n(resolution 48/1). It is our hope that the international\r\ncommunity will respond positively and generously to this\r\nhistoric decision; and that it will quickly lead to the\r\nprovision of ample financial and technical assistance, as well\r\nas to appropriate investments, that will allow a new\r\nnon-racial Government to begin redressing the grave\r\ninequalities in all aspects of life in South Africa. We also\r\nhope that, in time, the advancement of greater economic and\r\nsocial equity in South Africa will mitigate, and eventually\r\nresolve, other problems that are the legacy of apartheid,\r\nincluding the rampant and widespread violence which\r\nthreatens the process of transformation in the country.\r\nOver the years the Government and people of Trinidad\r\nand Tobago have faithfully monitored the progress of the\r\nSouth African people on their arduous journey to this critical\r\npoint in their history. We have adhered assiduously to the\r\nvarious sanctions and other restrictive measures adopted\r\nagainst South Africa by the United Nations. Within our\r\nlimited means we have also extended a helping hand to the\r\nvictims of apartheid. Trinidad and Tobago has shared in the\r\nanguish of South Africans in their long struggle against the\r\nracist system of apartheid. We will also rejoice with them\r\nin their victory as we anxiously await the dawn of a free,\r\njust, non-racial and prosperous society in South Africa.\r\nHere at the United Nations let us seek to emulate the\r\ncourage and statesmanship recently demonstrated by the\r\nmajor political actors in the Middle East and South Africa.\r\nWe too must seize the opportunities for peace and seek to\r\nemploy fully the machinery at our disposal in the active\r\npursuit of a better future. Amid the growing anxieties and\r\ninsecurities pervading many societies, member States have\r\na collective responsibility to the millions around the globe\r\nwho continue to repose much faith and hope in this\r\nOrganization and its ability to address successfully the\r\nmyriad political, economic, environmental and social\r\nproblems now confronting us all. Trinidad and Tobago\r\ntherefore joins in celebrating a reinvigorated United Nations,\r\nwhich is seeking to have a more meaningful impact on the\r\nlives of the world’s peoples.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago applauds the heightened\r\ninvolvement of the United Nations in the effort to restore\r\ndemocracy to Haiti and to secure the safe return of President\r\nJean-Bertrand Aristide to the helm of a legitimate\r\nconstitutional government. The United Nations, with its\r\nactive involvement in the organization of the 1990 elections\r\nin Haiti, facilitated the free expression by the Haitian people\r\nof their unfulfilled dreams and yearnings for freedom and a\r\ndecent standard of life. It is therefore only fitting that this\r\nOrganization, with the consent of the legitimate government\r\nof Haiti, should provide maximum support to efforts to\r\nguarantee a peaceful return to democracy and national\r\nreconciliation in that country, without which those dreams\r\nwould not be realized.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is concerned at the serious\r\ndeterioration in the situation in Haiti since the welcome\r\nsigning in July of this year of the Governors Island\r\nAgreement and the New York Pact. We deplore the flagrant\r\nviolations of human rights and the blood-letting, which must\r\nbe stopped. We express the hope that international efforts\r\nto establish a new police force in Haiti and to\r\nprofessionalize its armed forces will lead to greater\r\nguarantees of life and liberty in Haiti. My delegation takes\r\nthis opportunity to commend the Special Envoy for Haiti,\r\nMr. Dante Caputo, as well as the able staff of the\r\ninternational Civilian Mission in Haiti for their invaluable\r\ncontribution towards resolving the crisis.\r\nDevelopments in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in\r\nSomalia are among the more worrisome of those in which\r\nthe United Nations has been involved, particularly in view\r\nof the Organization’s inability to stem the tide of violence\r\nand suffering. United Nations interventions in these areas\r\nare also increasingly being regarded as test cases for the new\r\nUnited Nations of the post-cold-war era.\r\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the horror and savagery of\r\nthe persistent attacks on innocent civilians, particularly on\r\nthe Muslim population, have elicited entirely inadequate\r\nresponses from the international community.\r\nNotwithstanding the efforts of the United Nations Protection\r\nForce and the various international and non-governmental\r\nhumanitarian organizations, thousands continue to starve, are\r\nexpelled from their homes and regions, or perish at the\r\nhands of perpetrators of genocide and \"ethnic cleansing\".\r\nYet, despite threats of punishment on the part of the Security\r\nCouncil, these and other atrocities are committed with\r\nimpunity, while violent attempts to dismember the sovereign\r\nState of Bosnia and Herzegovina persist. The United\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 3\r\nNations can ill afford to fail Bosnia and Herzegovina, for\r\nthat failure will have serious repercussions in the region and\r\nbeyond, as well as repercussions for the Organization.\r\nWe have also witnessed alarming developments in\r\nSomalia. In the early stages of United Nations involvement\r\nin the country it was faced with a unique combination of\r\nfactors, including massive starvation and famine, widespread\r\nviolence, the ready availability among the populace of\r\nweaponry of varying sophistication, and a total absence of\r\nany centralized authority. Today, with the assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations and other organizations, Somalis of good will\r\ncan be proud of the successes achieved in breaking the\r\nbackbone of the devastating famine and in making\r\nsignificant, though limited, strides towards the restoration of\r\ncivil government and political reconciliation.\r\nIt is impossible, however, to be oblivious to the major\r\nmilitary engagements in the Somali capital of Mogadishu,\r\nwhich have led to tragic loss of life and have seriously\r\nimperilled the United Nations operation in that limited area.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago deplores the vicious attacks on the\r\npeace-keeping forces of the United Nations Operation in\r\nSomalia (UNOSOM II), which could ultimately derail efforts\r\nto restore peace and security to the country and frustrate the\r\nattainment by the Somali people of their goals and\r\naspirations.\r\nWe also support the call for urgent steps to be taken to\r\nensure the safety and security of the tens of thousands of\r\nmen and women who are engaged in these difficult and\r\ndangerous United Nations peace-keeping operations around\r\nthe world.\r\nThe extent of human suffering and instability now being\r\nexperienced as a consequence of general economic\r\nstagnation is as disconcerting and disheartening as that\r\nvisited upon us by war and strife. Many communities are in\r\nthe midst of economic and social crisis. Poverty,\r\nunemployment and crime are increasingly threatening the\r\nvery fabric of societies and are clamouring for the concerted\r\nattention of the international community. The United\r\nNations must heed this call since, as stated by the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali:\r\n\"social peace is as important as strategic or political\r\npeace\". (A/47//277, para. 59)\r\nThis issue is of utmost importance to Trinidad and\r\nTobago, which has not been spared the ravaging effects of\r\na decline in economic activity. The price of the single\r\nproduct which represents the mainstay of our economy, and\r\nwhich accounts for more than 40 per cent of government\r\nrevenue and over 80 per cent of foreign exchange earnings,\r\nhas been in steady decline. This reality, and the structural\r\nadjustment policies which have had to be implemented in\r\nsupport of long-term development, have resulted in serious\r\ndislocations in the short term. The ranks of the unemployed\r\nhave grown to approximately 20 per cent and there is an\r\nincreasing need to provide safety nets for the more\r\nvulnerable in this society at a time when government\r\nrevenue continues to fall.\r\nFurther, Trinidad and Tobago’s very capacity to provide\r\nsufficient social services to those not in a position to make\r\nthe burdensome sacrifices required of the general population\r\nhas also been severely hampered by onerous debt-servicing\r\npayments. These challenges which we are experiencing in\r\nTrinidad and Tobago are widely shared by other developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe same spirit of cooperation and activism which now\r\ncharacterizes the United Nations approach to political and\r\nsecurity questions must also impel the international\r\ncommunity to address economic and social questions with an\r\nequal sense of urgency. The United Nations agenda for\r\ndevelopment, which the Secretary-General has been\r\nmandated to prepare, must be given priority attention in the\r\nyear ahead. In this context, and with the aim of forging a\r\nnew partnership in the quest for solutions to global economic\r\nproblems, it may be opportune to consider the convening of\r\na world economic summit.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is of the view that the United\r\nNations agenda for development should not be restricted to\r\nproviding guidelines for future action by the United Nations\r\nin the economic and social sectors. It should also include\r\nrecommendations for strengthening the capacity of this\r\nOrganization to enhance international cooperation in these\r\nfields and to promote the advancement of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nAt its forty-seventh session the General Assembly\r\nreaffirmed that development is a shared responsibility. If\r\nour collective war on poverty, disease, unemployment and\r\nother challenges to development is to succeed, it must also\r\nbe undertaken on the basis of a true partnership, a\r\npartnership involving individuals, States, regional and\r\ninternational organizations and non-governmental entities, for\r\nwe must engender a sense of inclusion among all of\r\nsociety’s economic and social actors, while giving due\r\nrecognition to their respective roles and responsibilities.\r\nHowever, Trinidad and Tobago also shares the\r\nperspective of the Secretary-General, as stated in his 1993\r\nreport on the work of the Organization, that\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\n\"States and their sovereignty are increasingly\r\nrecognized as indispensable building-blocks of\r\ninternational order and problem-solving.\" (A/48/1, para.\r\n13)\r\nWhile all credible entities should be allowed to contribute to\r\ntheir greatest potential towards our shared objectives, States\r\nmust not be deprived of the proper tools of governance and\r\nthe opportunity to utilize them effectively on the basis of\r\nconsidered national strategies and priorities.\r\nThe concept of partnership must apply equally to the\r\narea of development finance and to trade. As regards the\r\nlatter, Trinidad and Tobago has steered the steady course of\r\ntrade liberalization but, like many other developing nations,\r\nhas encountered persistent restrictions in the markets of the\r\nindustrialized countries. It is hoped that the formation of\r\nmega-trading blocs will not compound these difficulties\r\nfurther.\r\nWe witnessed the application of the principle of global\r\npartnership in the convening of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development and the\r\nadoption of Agenda 21 in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. To\r\ndate the first important steps have been taken towards the\r\nimplementation of the comprehensive programme of\r\nactivities for sustainable development contained in Agenda\r\n21. The 1994 Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island States presents the next\r\nimportant opportunity for the international community to\r\ndemonstrate the continued political will to fulfil the\r\ncommitments undertaken at the Earth Summit in 1992.\r\nFor small island nations like Trinidad and Tobago, this\r\nGlobal Conference, to be held in Barbados in April of next\r\nyear, is critical to our efforts to forge, with the assistance of\r\nthe international community, appropriate strategies for the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, as it pertains to our specific\r\nsituation. We strongly believe that small States should not\r\nbe penalized for their limited capacity to inflict major\r\ndamage on the global environment. Positive recognition\r\nshould instead be given to their greater propensity for\r\nattracting a disproportionate share of environmental damage.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago hopes that adequate concessional funds\r\nwill be provided for the sustainable-development activities of\r\nthe small island developing States, as an important\r\ncomplement to initiatives taken at the national and regional\r\nlevels.\r\nThe urgency that developing countries, such as my\r\nown, attach to the elaboration of the proposed agenda for\r\ndevelopment signals the importance we attach to achieving\r\na proper balance in the level of resources devoted to political\r\nand security questions and those allocated to economic and\r\nsocial programmes. The World Conference on Population\r\nand Development in 1994, the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen in 1995 and the preparations for these Conferences,\r\nwill also contribute significantly to a strengthened economic\r\nand social agenda within the United Nations.\r\nIn addition, it is our hope that substantive preparations\r\nfor the 1995 World Summit for Social Development will\r\nreinforce the importance of focusing on the ultimate\r\nobjective of our development policies and programmes: the\r\nwell-being and advancement of people.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago intends to follow closely the\r\nhigh-level plenary discussions to be held on international\r\ncooperation in the fight against drug abuse and illicit drug-\r\ntrafficking. Our country has fallen victim to the increased\r\ntransit of illegal drugs through its territory. As is often the\r\ncase, increased levels of illicit trafficking have led to\r\nwidespread drug abuse and an accompanying rise in other\r\ncrimes. We note that this problem continues to plague a\r\ngrowing number of nations and therefore urge that higher\r\npriority be given to the United Nations programmes designed\r\nto combat this menace.\r\nThe United Nations has not been provided with the\r\nfinancial resources needed to implement its legislative\r\nmandates. We have now exhausted some of the funds from\r\nwhich relief was frequently obtained in past years, resulting\r\nin a serious threat to the daily operations of the\r\nOrganization. However, while it will be readily agreed that\r\nany organization must be provided with the resources it\r\nneeds to carry out its functions, it must also be admitted that\r\nthere is a growing imbalance between the demands being\r\nmade upon the United Nations and the ability of a growing\r\nnumber of States to meet the cost of these demands. This\r\nis particularly the case with the peace-keeping budget, which\r\nin 1993 is expected to be almost three times the amount of\r\nthe regular budget.\r\nThe United Nations is now in a critical period of\r\nadjustment and reorientation. Trinidad and Tobago concurs\r\nwith the view that there must be improvements in the\r\nadministrative and operational performance of the United\r\nNations in all its activities. Transparency and accountability\r\nmust be the watchwords of the Organization.\r\nAs we approach our fiftieth anniversary, we the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations must remain steadfast in our\r\nsupport for the fundamental purposes and principles which\r\nhave promoted order and security in the world community.\r\nWe must also meet the challenges and grasp the\r\nopportunities presented by the altered global environment.\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 5\r\nLet us forge ahead, confident in our ability to work together\r\nand to succeed in advancing the cause of peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Gyaw (Myanmar): I wish at the outset to extend\r\nto you, Sir, my congratulations on your election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Your\r\nelection reflects the Assembly’s full confidence in you. My\r\ndelegation feels sure that we can count on your wide\r\nexperience and personal skills to guide our deliberations to\r\na fruitful conclusion. Allow me also to take this opportunity\r\nto express my delegation’s appreciation to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, for his tireless efforts to\r\nensure the success of the forty-seventh session.\r\nI am pleased to see among us delegations from the six\r\nnew Member States which joined the Organization this year.\r\nTheir presence in this Hall reflects the momentous changes\r\ntaking place in the world today and the growing confidence\r\nin the United Nations itself. My delegation feels that these\r\nnew Members, each with its own distinctive historical,\r\ncultural and political backgrounds, will have important\r\ncontributions to make to the Organization. My delegation\r\nwelcomes them all and looks forward to working with them.\r\nIt is an outstanding feature of our times that the\r\nnumber of sovereign States has increased and that the role\r\nof the Organization has grown enormously. There is today\r\na remarkable growth in the demand for the services of the\r\nUnited Nations. As noted by the Secretary-General, the\r\nOrganization has in the past four years become involved in\r\nas many peace-keeping operations as it had in the previous\r\nfour decades. The United Nations is increasingly called\r\nupon to pour oil on troubled waters. Its peace-keeping\r\nmissions are being carried out across the globe, from\r\nSomalia to Cambodia, and its agencies for development and\r\nhumanitarian affairs have fanned out even further afield. As\r\nthe United Nations assumes a more central role in the area\r\nof international security, it is essential that the Organization,\r\nin pursuit of the purposes stated in Article 1, act and be seen\r\nto act in accordance with the principles of the Charter.\r\nMyanmar would like to believe that in the post-cold-war era,\r\nStates will adhere strictly to the Charter’s principles and\r\nmake concerted efforts to establish a workable system of\r\ncollective security. Just as the prohibition of the threat or\r\nuse of force against the territorial integrity or political\r\nindependence of any State is fundamental in inter-State\r\nrelations, the Charter unambiguously prohibits, in the\r\nwell-known paragraph 7 of Article 2, any intervention of the\r\nUnited Nations itself \"in matters which are essentially within\r\nthe domestic jurisdiction of any State\". This prohibition\r\napplies equally to States and to other international\r\norganizations. In this time of major political and economic\r\nchanges in a volatile world, extraordinary care should be\r\ntaken to uphold such basic principles as respect for the\r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of States.\r\nMyanmar fully supports the Security Council’s\r\nrecommendation of 28 May 1993, which states that the\r\nCouncil considers that United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations should be conducted in accordance with\r\noperational principles consistent with the provisions of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. Those operational principles\r\ninclude a clear political goal with a precise mandate subject\r\nto periodic review and to change in its character or duration\r\nonly by the Council itself; the consent of the Government\r\nand, where appropriate the parties concerned, save in\r\nexceptional cases; support for a political process or for the\r\npeaceful settlement of the dispute; and impartiality in\r\nimplementing Security Council decisions.\r\nThe experience in Somalia underscores the need to\r\nadhere to those principles in all peace-keeping and\r\npeacemaking operations. In particular, it underscores the\r\nneed to exercise great prudence in sanctioning the use of\r\nforce in such operations and in its application on the ground.\r\nIt has also shown that peace-keeping operations cannot\r\nsucceed without the willing cooperation of all the parties\r\nconcerned.\r\nThe conscience of the world has been troubled by the\r\nhorror of the ongoing conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWhile it is true that the United Nations has taken some\r\naction in response to the crisis and that negotiations have\r\nbeen initiated in Geneva, much more needs to be done to\r\nstop the fighting and find a peaceful solution. The situation\r\nis complex but it must be realized that innocent men, women\r\nand children in the besieged towns and villages expect more\r\nof an international Organization whose principal purpose is\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. Unless\r\nappropriate actions are taken, the United Nations runs the\r\nrisk of being seen as protecting only certain countries or\r\ninterests.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that in Cambodia, the\r\nUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia has\r\nsuccessfully discharged its main responsibility of\r\nsupervising, monitoring and verifying the cease-fire and of\r\norganizing and conducting free and fair elections as\r\nscheduled, despite the decision of one of the Cambodian\r\nparties to stay away from the elections. The United Nations\r\nefforts to foster a democratic process and to bring back\r\npeace and stability to a country ravaged by two decades of\r\ncivil strife and war is an outstanding achievement. We\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to pay a warm and\r\nspecial tribute to Mr. Yasushi Akashi, the Special\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, who handled a very\r\ndelicate situation with great prudence and tact. This\r\nachievement has made it possible for the people of\r\nCambodia to promulgate a new Constitution restoring the\r\nmonarchy and to form a broadly based Government. The\r\naccession to the throne of Cambodia by His Majesty King\r\nNorodom Sihanouk, a great patriot and statesman, is a\r\nhistoric event which augurs well for the rebuilding of a\r\npeaceful, unified and democratic Cambodia. As close\r\nneighbours, we look forward to peace and stability in\r\nCambodia and to working closely with the Government and\r\nthe people of Cambodia.\r\nThe effort to end apartheid in South Africa, sustained\r\nover decades, has produced positive results. The\r\nannouncement of an election date, 27 April 1994, for the\r\nfirst general elections in South Africa’s history based on\r\nuniversal franchise is a significant achievement. The\r\nelections will provide the black majority the opportunity to\r\nshape its own destiny by participating in a process which it\r\nhad hitherto been denied. It is our hope that this will ensure\r\nthat the objective of the people of South Africa for a\r\ndemocratic, non-racial and united South Africa will be\r\nachieved. Much, however, remains to be done to maintain\r\nthe election timetable, and the next six months will be\r\ncritical in ending apartheid. We note that four pieces of\r\nlegislation - the Independent Electoral Commission, the\r\nIndependent Media Commission, the Independent\r\nBroadcasting Authority and the Transitional Executive\r\nCouncil - have been adopted by both the Negotiating\r\nCouncil and the South African Parliament. We hope that\r\nthese bodies will be established as soon as possible to guide\r\nthe country through the constitutional process.\r\nI am happy to note that the winds of change blowing\r\nacross our world have not left the Middle East untouched.\r\nThe historic agreement between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization on mutual recognition has\r\neffectively removed a major obstacle to peace in that region.\r\nWe welcome this positive step and the signing of the\r\nDeclaration of Principles, which envisions self-rule by\r\nPalestinians in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho. We are also\r\npleased to note that Israel and Jordan have signed the agreed\r\ncommon agenda of the peace negotiations between them.\r\nWe congratulate all parties concerned for displaying rare\r\ncourage and mutual accommodation in reaching the accords.\r\nThese important steps, we hope, will open the way to\r\nreconciliation between neighbours and to the achievement of\r\na just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East\r\nbased on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973).\r\nThe new climate of cooperation between the United\r\nStates of America and the Russian Federation opens up at\r\nleast the prospect of real progress in disarmament. This is\r\namply demonstrated by the signing of the chemical weapons\r\nConvention in Paris earlier this year by an unprecedented\r\nnumber of countries. Myanmar was part of the Geneva\r\nConference process leading to that comprehensive\r\ninstrument, and continues to take an active part in the\r\nPreparatory Commission for the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons.\r\nThe increased attention we have been devoting to\r\nchemical weapons should not distract us from nuclear\r\ndisarmament issues, notably from the need to strengthen the\r\ninternational non-proliferation regime and to ban all nuclear\r\ntesting. The enormous quantities of nuclear material that\r\nexist in the world today and the increasing difficulty of\r\ndetecting the clandestine development of nuclear weapons\r\nunderscore the need to redouble efforts to strengthen\r\nsafeguards against proliferation. Myanmar will work with\r\nother delegations for the success of the 1995 Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) review and extension Conference.\r\nWith the end of the Cold War, the case for reducing the\r\nnumber of large strategic nuclear weapons is strong. The\r\nUnited States and Russia should reduce their forces more\r\ndrastically than they agreed to in START II and refrain from\r\nimproving their nuclear arsenals both qualitatively and\r\nquantitatively. Meanwhile every effort must be made to\r\nfulfill the commitment undertaken in the 1963 Treaty\r\nBanning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer\r\nSpace and Under Water. A comprehensive ban on nuclear\r\ntesting has been a long-standing objective of the international\r\ncommunity, including Myanmar. We hope that this\r\nobjective will be achieved at the earliest possible date,\r\npreferably before the NPT review and extension Conference\r\nconvenes.\r\nThe global economic recovery remains high on the\r\ninternational agenda. In a highly interdependent global\r\neconomy, the prosperity and growth of the developed and\r\nthe developing countries are intertwined. We therefore\r\nwelcome the statement of the Group of Seven at the Tokyo\r\nSummit which recognizes that sustainable development and\r\nintegration of the developing countries into the world\r\neconomy is essential for global peace and prosperity. We\r\nlook forward to the concretization of the commitment by the\r\nGroup of Seven to pursue a comprehensive approach\r\ncovering aid, trade, investment and debt strategy.\r\nDebt strategy, in our view, should not be carried out on\r\na case-by-case basis. It should be comprehensive for all\r\ndebtor countries. We are encouraged by the statement that\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 7\r\nthe major industrialized countries are determined to curb\r\nprotectionism and that no recourse will be made to initiatives\r\nand arrangements that threaten to undermine the open\r\nmultilateral system. High priority must be given to the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. The Punta del\r\nEste Declaration is still valid, as are the provisions therein\r\non special and differential treatment for the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nWe have always subscribed to the view that the United\r\nNations occupies a unique position as a major forum for the\r\npromotion of international cooperation for development. It\r\nhas now been universally recognized that world peace and\r\nsecurity, to be enduring must be underpinned by economic\r\nand social development worldwide. In this regard we share\r\nyour view, Mr. President, that \"An Agenda for Peace\" must\r\nnow be complemented by \"An Agenda for Development\".\r\nWe ardently hope that deliberations on this topic at the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly will lead to\r\nenhanced international cooperation for development, thereby\r\ncontributing to global economic recovery and international\r\npeace.\r\nIn Myanmar we believe that political progress and\r\neconomic development are interdependent and that both are\r\nvital to the well-being of the country. For this reason we\r\nhave been endeavouring to ensure political stability while\r\npromoting economic reforms. Last year I stated here that\r\nsteps were being taken to convene a National Convention in\r\norder to formulate guidelines for a firm and enduring\r\nconstitution.I am now happy to report that the National\r\nConvention commenced work on 9 January of this year.\r\nThe Convention is an essential prerequisite for the building\r\nof a democratic society in Myanmar, and its significance can\r\nhardly be overemphasized. It has the participation of nearly\r\n700 delegates comprising elected representatives,\r\nrepresentatives of the national races, political parties,\r\npeasants, workers, intelligentsia and technocrats, State\r\nservice personnel, and specially invited persons. There is\r\nuniversal agreement that the objectives of the Convention\r\nshould be to uphold the principles of non-disintegration of\r\nthe Union, non-disintegration of national solidarity and\r\nperpetuation of national sovereignty; to nurture the universal\r\nvalues of justice, liberty and equality; and to enable the\r\nTatmadaw, the Myanmar Defence Services, to participate in\r\na leading role in national politics.\r\nFollowing intensive deliberations, agreement has been\r\nreached on the chapter on the fundamental principles of the\r\nState, which is of paramount importance as it embodies the\r\nessence of the new constitution. Following extensive\r\ndiscussions, consensus has also been reached on these\r\nFundamental Principles. In a period of nine months much\r\nhas been accomplished. Much of course remains to be done.\r\nThe Convention is presently in recess in order to provide\r\ntime for the delegates to make necessary preparations for the\r\nnext phase, which will commence on 18 January 1994.\r\nThe delegates to the Convention have had the\r\nopportunity to study the Constitutions of various countries so\r\nthat they may cull the best from around the world.\r\nHowever, there can be no single model that can be copied\r\nand superimposed on Myanmar. The constitution to be\r\ndrafted must be in harmony with our own conditions and\r\nreflect the wishes and aspirations of the entire nation. The\r\nhistory of the modern nation of Myanmar is synonymous\r\nwith the history of the Tatmadaw. Since the time of our\r\nstruggle for national independence it has been in the\r\nforefront of national politics. On four occasions since\r\nindependence when the country’s national sovereignty and\r\nindependence were threatened, the Tatmadaw was called\r\nupon to shoulder national responsibilities to protect and\r\nsafeguard the nation. The Tatmadaw does not covet power.\r\nNor does it have any desire to hold on to the reins of power.\r\nIt is above party politics. However, as it represents the\r\nsingle disciplined organization in the nation it is incumbent\r\nupon it to play a leading role in national politics,\r\nsafeguarding the nation, national unity and national\r\nsovereignty.\r\nOn the economic front, efforts are being made to ensure\r\na smooth transition from a centrally planned economy to a\r\nmarket economy. Now that teething pains have been\r\novercome the economy is on the mend. It is significant that\r\nthe gross domestic product grew by 10.9 per cent in\r\n1992-1993. The private sector, which only a few years ago\r\nwas almost non-existent, is expanding. Today there are a\r\ngrowing number of investors, both local and foreign, in\r\nfisheries, mining, oil exploration, manufacturing and various\r\nother sectors. Major offshore oil and gas finds in our waters\r\nhave also heightened interest among friends and neighbours\r\nin establishing mutually beneficial economic cooperation.\r\nThe political and economic changes are evidenced by\r\nthe vast transformations taking place in much of the country.\r\nIn both urban and rural areas, as well as in the border\r\nregions, there is unprecedented infrastructure building:\r\nschools, hospitals and dispensaries, as well as railways,\r\nroads, bridges and multi-purpose dams, are going up\r\neverywhere. That the people’s living standards are rising is\r\nplain for all disinterested observers to see.\r\nIn spite of the positive political and economic changes\r\ntaking place in Myanmar, some continue to point an\r\naccusing finger at us in regard to human rights. It bears\r\nrepeating that when we speak of human rights, the diversity\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nof our people’s historical, cultural and religious backgrounds\r\nmust neither be minimized nor forgotten. There is no unique\r\nmodel of implementation of human rights that can be\r\nsuperimposed on a given country. Any attempt to do so\r\nwould only spell chaos. If parts of the international\r\ncommunity are now beginning to contemplate the use of the\r\nissue of human rights as a pretext for intervening in\r\ndomestic affairs of States, they will only undermine the very\r\nrights they wish to protect and promote.\r\nPoverty is one of the most pressing human rights issues\r\nin our world today, and that is what we should seek to\r\novercome. In Myanmar we are giving priority to the\r\nelimination of poverty and the narrowing of the gap between\r\nthe rich and the poor, the city dwellers and the rural folk.\r\nWe are redoubling our efforts to ensure that all citizens have\r\nequal opportunity in their access to food, housing,\r\ntransportation, employment, education and health services.\r\nOn our western borders, over 40,000 returnees from\r\nBangladesh have been systematically received and returned\r\nto their hearth and home. This is the result of the good-\r\nneighbourly relations that exist between Myanmar and\r\nBangladesh. In accordance with the agreement reached\r\nbetween the two countries in April 1992, we will continue\r\nto receive those who are eligible to come as soon as their\r\ncases can be processed by the authorities concerned in the\r\ncamps. The United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, who visited Myanmar\r\nrecently, has been fully briefed on the important measures\r\nwe have taken. A memorandum of understanding between\r\nMyanmar and the Office of the High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) will be signed shortly; it will provide\r\nfor the latter’s presence on the Myanmar side of the border.\r\nWe understand the need to find a lasting solution to the\r\ncomplex problem of transborder migration for economic or\r\nenvironmental reasons, and to that end we intend to hold\r\nconsultations with our Bangladeshi friends.\r\nIt has been our consistent policy to cooperate fully with\r\nthe United Nations in every field, including human rights.\r\nNot only have we furnished information sought by various\r\nUnited Nations bodies dealing with human rights; we also\r\nreceived in 1992 the Special Rapporteur appointed by the\r\nCommission on Human Rights, Mr. Yozo Yokota. We will\r\nreceive him yet again this year to demonstrate our good will.\r\nIt is our hope that Myanmar’s traditional respect for human\r\nrights as well as the remarkable changes taking place\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the country - from the\r\ncities and towns to the border areas - will be seen and\r\nappreciated.\r\nThrough the constructive measures taken in the past\r\nfive years, 10 terrorist groups have now returned to the legal\r\nfold. Just last week, as the result of negotiations held\r\nbetween the Government and Kachin national leaders in a\r\nspirit of mutual accommodation and understanding as befits\r\nblood brothers, the Kachin terrorist group returned to the\r\nlegal fold and has already joined hands with the Government\r\nin promoting peace and prosperity in the Kachin state. Just\r\nas the representatives of the nine preceding groups are\r\nactively participating in the National Convention, the\r\nrepresentatives of this group, too, will enjoy the same rights.\r\nIt augurs well for the peace and unity of our country that\r\nthese 10 terrorist groups which have renounced the use of\r\nforce have been reintegrated into the national mainstream.\r\nThe return of our prodigal sons from 10 different\r\nnational races gives the lie to allegations that minority\r\ngroups in Myanmar are being oppressed, that their human\r\nrights are being grossly violated and that democracy is non-\r\nexistent in the country. Never before in the history of\r\nindependent Myanmar have so many terrorist groups\r\nreturned to the legal fold in such numbers. That they have\r\ndone so is unmistakable testimony to the complete trust and\r\nconfidence which the national races have in the policy of\r\nnational reconciliation espoused by the State Law and Order\r\nRestoration Council and in its good will and sincerity. Few\r\nGovernments can claim such positive achievements.\r\nThe problem of illicit drugs is like a cancer that poses\r\na great threat to the stability and well-being not only of our\r\ncountry but also of the international community. Myanmar\r\nremains steadfast in its resolve to overcome this scourge.\r\nWe realize that the problem of illicit drugs and trafficking\r\ntranscends borders and is too complex to be tackled by any\r\ncountry acting alone. We have accordingly been working\r\ntogether with the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP) and neighbouring countries to expand\r\nactivities aimed at reducing the supply of illicit drugs and\r\neventually eliminating opium cultivation altogether. In June\r\n1992 Myanmar took the initiative by signing agreements\r\nwith the People’s Republic of China and the UNDCP and\r\nalso with Thailand and the UNDCP regarding crop\r\nsubstitution, demand reduction and law enforcement.\r\nUNDCP experts are already in the country working to\r\nachieve these goals. Myanmar and Laos have also agreed to\r\ncooperate in this regard. The Governments of Myanmar,\r\nLaos, Thailand and China, aware that the problems of illicit\r\ndrug production, trafficking and abuse can be addressed only\r\nthrough concerted international efforts, will sign a\r\nmemorandum of understanding with the UNDCP during the\r\ncourse of the high-level plenary meetings of the General\r\nAssembly on drug control to be held in New York from 26\r\nto 27 October.\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 9\r\nLast April, Myanmar signed a drug agreement with\r\nIndia, and a similar agreement will be worked out with our\r\nremaining neighbour, Bangladesh. We are confident that\r\nthis comprehensive and coordinated effort at the subregional\r\nlevel will produce the desired results. In the past year the\r\nstrategy of combining prevention, education, treatment and\r\nrehabilitation of addicts, law enforcement and border area\r\ndevelopment has borne fruit. Significant amounts of illicit\r\ndrugs and drug paraphernalia have been seized and\r\ndestroyed. United Nations personnel and other visitors have\r\nbeen given the opportunity to visit the regions where opium\r\nis grown.\r\nIn August, United States Congressman Charles B.\r\nRangel, Chairman of the House Narcotics Abuse and Control\r\nCommittee, and Congressman Bill Richardson visited eastern\r\nShan State to acquire first-hand knowledge of the illicit drug\r\nproblem. During the visit they witnessed the destruction of\r\nlarge amounts of opium, heroin, opium oil, liquid opium and\r\nother drugs seized by the Myanmar authorities. Myanmar\r\nwill continue to give top priority to overcoming the threat\r\nposed by illicit drugs, and it is our hope that more and more\r\ncountries will join hands with us in this noble endeavour.\r\nMyanmar today is on the threshold of a new era. The\r\npolitical, economic, social and administrative reforms\r\ncurrently being implemented herald a united, stable, peaceful\r\nand prosperous country. The new society will guarantee the\r\nunity of the national races and ensure the perpetuation of our\r\nnational independence and sovereignty. It will be in\r\nharmony with its environment, its historical experiences, and\r\nthe political, economic and social conditions of the nation.\r\nIt will reflect the diverse culture and traditions of the\r\nnational races in the union.\r\nThe new Myanmar nation that is envisaged by the\r\nNational Convention will be a genuine multi-party\r\ndemocratic state. It will be a nation based on the universal\r\nvalues of justice, liberty and equality. There will be social\r\njustice, economic justice and political justice. There will be\r\na complete separation of powers of state, and the judiciary\r\nwill enjoy total independence. Freedom of thought, freedom\r\nof expression, freedom of belief, freedom of worship,\r\nfreedom to seek a livelihood and freedom of organization\r\nwill be guaranteed. There will also be equality of status,\r\nequality of opportunity and equality before the law.\r\nThese conditions will not materialize of their own\r\naccord. The right atmosphere must be created. To this end,\r\nmy Government is doing its utmost to vindicate the trust\r\nplaced in it by the people. As the democratic society\r\nenvisaged is for the people of Myanmar, it must reflect the\r\nobjective conditions of the country and be established in the\r\nmanner and at the pace best suited to it.\r\nAllow me to conclude by saying that the Tatmadaw\r\nhave never failed the people in their hour of need and will\r\nnot do so at this historic moment when a new nation is\r\nbeing created.\r\nMr. TAITT (Barbados): Permit me, Sir, on behalf of\r\nthe Government and people of Barbados, to express our\r\nprofound appreciation of the high honour which the\r\ninternational community has done to our region by your\r\nunanimous election to the presidency of the forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. As I join all those who\r\nhave offered you congratulations from this rostrum, I feel\r\nbound to note with pride the considerable diplomatic skill,\r\nexperience and commitment which you bring to the Chair\r\nand which allow my delegation the confidence to anticipate\r\na most successful and satisfactory session.\r\nMay I also commend your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan\r\nGanev, for having safely guided us through the demanding\r\ndeliberations of the forty-seventh session.\r\nWe particularly thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nvaliant efforts to secure international peace and security.\r\nBarbados welcomes Andorra, Eritrea, the Czech\r\nRepublic, Monaco, Macedonia and Slovakia to membership\r\nof this great Organization, which we are sure will benefit\r\nfrom their participation.\r\nIt augurs well for the outcome of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that it has started against a backdrop of\r\nsome success - however tenuous - in Haiti, in South Africa\r\nand in the Middle East. The cases of the Middle East and\r\nSouth Africa, especially, represent triumphs of diplomacy\r\nand patient negotiation. In this regard, no praise is too high\r\nfor Norway’s outstanding contribution in guiding seemingly\r\nintractable enemies along the difficult and daring path\r\ntowards peace. As we in Barbados laud such a remarkable\r\nachievement, we hope fervently that it will lead soon to the\r\nlong-sought goals of an Israel within secure boundaries and\r\na homeland for the Palestinian people, goals envisaged in\r\nSecurity\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We dare to\r\nhope, too, that that reality, once achieved, will lead to a\r\nlasting peace in the region.\r\nIn South Africa, despite the carefully orchestrated\r\ncampaign of violence and terrorism aimed at subverting\r\nevery effort to create a non-racial, democratic South Africa,\r\nPresident de Klerk African National Congress President,\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nNelson Mandela have, with truly remarkable courage and\r\nforesight, brought their country to the point where the\r\ntransition to democracy has now been enshrined in the laws\r\nof South Africa. Barbados rejoices that a date has been\r\nfixed for the holding of universal elections, and we welcome\r\nthe establishment of the Transitional Executive Council to\r\nprepare for those elections.\r\nIn praising those two leaders, we must not overlook the\r\nsignificant contributions of the President of the Pan-\r\nAfricanist Congress, Mr. Clarence Makwetu, and the many\r\npatriots on all sides, present and past, who have made and\r\ncontinue to make their various contributions, sometimes even\r\nto the extent of the supreme sacrifice. The encouraging\r\nprogress in South Africa demands and deserves, no less than\r\nthe process in the Middle East, the wholehearted support of\r\nthe international community.\r\nThe issue of Haiti is a matter of extreme importance to\r\nthe peace and security of the people of the Caribbean. You\r\nare well aware, Sir, that the Heads of Government of the\r\nCaribbean Community were long convinced that the\r\nunfortunate and unacceptable state of affairs resulting from\r\nthe overthrow of the elected President of Haiti could be\r\nresolved only through the intervention of the Security\r\nCouncil, the valiant efforts of the Organization of American\r\nStates notwithstanding.\r\nThe fact that the Governors Island Agreement was\r\nsigned so soon after the adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 841 (1993) would seem to justify our consistent\r\nposition. Today we continue to be apprehensive over the\r\nlevel and nature of the widespread turmoil in Port-au-Prince,\r\nturmoil which seems designed to delay, if not derail, the\r\nreturn of President Aristide to his rightful place. The\r\ninternational community in general, and the Security Council\r\nin particular, must not sit idly by, merely expressing regret\r\nat the sorry state of affairs in that unhappy country. The\r\nSecurity Council - indeed, all of our countries - must be\r\nprepared to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that\r\nthe murders and assassinations cease. All parties must be\r\nmade to honour the Governors Island Agreement and the\r\nresults of the 1991 elections.\r\nThere is another issue which the people of the\r\nCaribbean have contemplated with more or less trepidation\r\nduring the past 34 years. And although none of them might\r\nhave an immediate solution to offer, many believe that\r\nnothing would bring more joy to the people of the region\r\nthan the announcement of an impending rapprochement\r\nbetween the Republic of Cuba and our great neighbour to the\r\nnorth. In the light of recent international events, Barbados\r\nrefuses to believe that only between these two countries can\r\nno path to a peaceful resolution of their conflict be found.\r\nFour years ago in Barbados we celebrated the 350th\r\nanniversary of parliamentary practice. And it is in that\r\ncontext that we applaud the United Nations for its role in the\r\nconduct of successful elections in Angola and Cambodia.\r\nWhile we are pleased at the post-election progress being\r\nmade in Cambodia, we are concerned about the deterioration\r\nin Angola. We urge the international community to be more\r\nvigilant in monitoring events in Angola. The comity of\r\nnations has a duty to ensure that the results of free and fair\r\nelections are accepted and respected by all parties - in Haiti,\r\nin Angola, in Cambodia or wherever else there is\r\ninvolvement by the United Nations in any such process. No\r\nparty anywhere should ever be allowed even to think that the\r\ninternational community would tolerate the frustration of\r\nproperly conducted election exercises.\r\nBarbados remains convinced that the international\r\ncommunity must adopt an integrated approach to peace, an\r\napproach which concentrates on building and preserving\r\npeace rather than on mere peace-keeping. Barbados\r\ntherefore appreciates the attention currently being paid by\r\nthis Organization to international security and peace-keeping.\r\nIndeed, we welcome the recent adoption of General\r\nAssembly resolution 47/120, endorsing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s \"Agenda for Peace\". We recognize that, in the\r\nsearch for consensus, the interests of all parties have not\r\nbeen fully addressed, but we consider that the reforms\r\nrecommended represent a useful first step towards the\r\nenhanced role the United Nations is called upon to play in\r\nthe promotion of international peace and security.\r\nInternational peace and security can hardly be attained\r\nif the global environment continues to be sullied by rampant\r\nhuman rights abuses. Barbados welcomes the advances\r\ncontained in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction of the World Conference on Human Rights,\r\nparticularly the re-emphasis of the universality of human\r\nrights and the right to development as a human right.\r\nHowever, we must here reiterate that the widespread\r\nresurgence of racism, xenophobia, religious intolerance,\r\nethnic conflicts and various other forms of human rights\r\nabuses pose a most serious threat to the peace and security\r\nof all of us.\r\nThe proposal to create a post of high commissioner for\r\nhuman rights was such a contentious issue at the World\r\nConference for Human Rights that it has been referred to\r\nthis session for action. Barbados considers that before such\r\na post is established the following considerations should be\r\ntaken into account. First, the mandate of the high\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 11\r\ncommissioner should be satisfactorily defined. Secondly,\r\nthere should be adequate safeguards to ensure the\r\ncommissioner’s independence and neutrality. Thirdly, the\r\noffice of the high commissioner should not be manipulated\r\nto achieve the political ends of any State. Fourthly, the high\r\ncommissioner should be empowered to investigate alleged\r\nhuman rights abuses across all borders, and not on a\r\nselective basis.\r\nBarbados believes that preventive measures taken to\r\nguarantee international peace and security must also include\r\nefforts to safeguard basic social and economic rights.\r\nHowever, we are equally convinced that not enough is being\r\ndone to address development problems. We concur in the\r\nSecretary-General’s view that respect for human rights, the\r\nrule of law and democracy cannot survive outside a\r\nframework of adequate development. Where access to food,\r\nclothing, shelter, education, health and the opportunity for\r\ngainful employment is denied, democracy cannot flourish.\r\nIn spite of 50 years of unprecedented technological\r\nprogress, in many parts of the world abject poverty still\r\npersists. An estimated 1.1 billion persons, or one-fifth of\r\nhumankind, are unable to afford even minimally acceptable\r\nlevels of food and shelter. This problem, though\r\nconcentrated largely within the developing world, has\r\ntranscended national boundaries and now affects persons in\r\nthe developing and developed countries alike. Low\r\ncommodity prices, lack of investment capital, the inability to\r\nsecure access to world markets, and high unemployment and\r\nlow productivity have contributed to the marginalization of\r\nmillions of unfortunate persons.\r\nParticularly hard hit are our young people, among\r\nwhom disillusionment and despair have already begun to\r\ntake their toll, driving a growing number of them to resort\r\nto various forms of anti-social behaviour, including drug\r\ntrafficking and drug abuse. This desperate situation will not\r\ndisappear because of speeches denouncing poverty, or the\r\nadoption of resolutions calling for its elimination. Rather,\r\nwe must urgently adopt radical measures designed to attack\r\nand eliminate the conditions which fuel the growing and\r\nunacceptable levels of poverty in our societies.\r\nBarbados considers that social development will be\r\namong the greatest challenges facing the United Nations in\r\nthe twenty-first century. We therefore regard the\r\nconvocation of the World Summit on Social Development,\r\nscheduled for Copenhagen in 1995, as a clear signal that\r\nsocial development has become a priority issue on the world\r\nagenda. Barbados believes that that Summit will provide the\r\ninternational community with an opportunity to direct\r\nattention to the acute problems relating to development. Our\r\nconviction is that the focus of the development debate must\r\nbe shifted to human development and that bold initiatives\r\nmust be taken to combat poverty and to lighten the burden\r\nwhich structural adjustment places on the most vulnerable in\r\nour societies - our women and our children.\r\nBarbados is heartened by the Secretary-General’s\r\n\"agenda for development\" proposal and looks forward with\r\ninterest to reviewing the report requested in General\r\nAssembly resolution 47/181. We also welcome the timely\r\ninitiative taken by the Government of Papua New Guinea, an\r\ninitiative in which I understand you yourself, Mr. President,\r\nhave no small interest. My delegation hopes that this matter\r\nwill be given the serious and urgent consideration it merits.\r\nAmong the deterrents to development, drug trafficking\r\nremains one source of grave concern to the Governments of\r\nthe Caribbean. Apart from the tragic consequences that drug\r\naddiction has for the health of our people, illegal drugs\r\nconstitute the single most pervasive ingredient of increased\r\ncrime in our societies. In Barbados, for example, the\r\nmajority of criminal cases brought before the courts involve\r\ndirectly or indirectly some linkage to drugs. Penal and\r\nhealth systems are being stretched to their limits, while the\r\nfinancial implications of enforcement and rehabilitation are\r\nstaggering. Not even developed countries have yet been able\r\nto eradicate from their societies drug abuse and its\r\nmirror-image, drug trafficking. Developing countries are\r\nstill further disadvantaged by their chronic inability to take\r\non the powerful drug cartels and the narco-terrorists with\r\nany hope of real success. The problem is transnational in\r\nscope.\r\nIt is therefore imperative that the Global Programme of\r\nAction adopted at the 1990 special session on drugs be\r\nimplemented as soon as possible and that cooperation at the\r\nbilateral, regional and multilateral levels be enhanced. The\r\nrole of the United Nations Drug Control Programme is vital\r\nto this process. Barbados looks forward to the four\r\nhigh-level special plenary meetings scheduled to take place\r\nduring this session. We expect that further measures to\r\ncombat the universal scourge of drug abuse will emerge,\r\nalong with the provision of the adequate funding necessary\r\nto achieve these ends.\r\nIt has been a year now since the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development was convened\r\nin Rio de Janeiro. Since that time, other matters - primarily\r\nmatters of peace and security - have helped to push\r\nenvironment and development issues out of the limelight.\r\nThe meeting of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, charged with the responsibility of monitoring\r\nthe implementation of Agenda 21, served to remind us that\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsustainable development must continue to receive serious\r\nattention from the international community. The\r\nCommission succeeded in generating the necessary political\r\nwill to impart a powerful impetus to national action for the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. We can ill afford any loss in\r\nmomentum.\r\nThis brings me to the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing States,\r\nwhich the Government of Barbados has offered to host. The\r\nConference will take place in Barbados from 25 April to 6\r\nMay 1994. The Government and people of Barbados are\r\nhonoured that the international community has, in accepting\r\nour offer, placed its confidence in our capacity to host\r\nsuccessfully a conference of this size and importance. The\r\nConference will be the first of the follow-up activities of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment (UNCED) to be completed. It presents an\r\nearly opportunity for the implementation of the commitments\r\nreached at the Rio Earth Summit. As such, the Conference\r\nalso represents a test of the political will of the international\r\ncommunity to match the solemn commitments of Agenda 21\r\nwith real action towards more sustainable development.\r\nMy colleague the Minister of the Environment, Housing\r\nand Lands of Barbados recently briefed the Preparatory\r\nCommittee of the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States on the\r\nprogress of preparations for the Conference. My delegation\r\nwill submit details on further progress when the item comes\r\nup for discussion in the substantive Committee. However,\r\nlet me at this stage put on record my Government’s\r\nappreciation of the spirit and atmosphere which prevailed in\r\nthe Preparatory Committee. Unfortunately, the meeting of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee fell victim to the emergency\r\nconference-servicing measures announced by the\r\nSecretary-General on 26 August 1993 and for that and other\r\nreasons the preparatory process did not go as far as it might\r\nhave. Barbados shares the view, expressed by many\r\ndelegations attending the meeting of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee, that it would be dangerous to leave finalization\r\nof the preparatory process until April 1994 in Barbados.\r\nGiven the number and complexity of the issues left\r\noutstanding from the Preparatory Committee, Barbados is\r\nconvinced that some arrangements must be put in place to\r\ncontinue the preparatory process. We therefore look forward\r\nto working with interested delegations towards reaching\r\nagreement on an appropriate mechanism for continuing the\r\npreparatory process prior to the commencement of the\r\nConference.\r\nThe Barbados Conference will provide the basis for the\r\nbuilding of a partnership for the implementation of the\r\ndecisions taken at Rio. The international community will be\r\nafforded the opportunity to signal its commitment to move\r\nforward towards more sustainable patterns of development\r\nin a pragmatic, realistic manner, based on practical,\r\nachievable goals. The people of Barbados look forward\r\neagerly to welcoming representatives of each and every\r\nMember State in April 1994.\r\nThe threat of natural disasters to the sustained\r\ndevelopment of small developing countries must not be\r\nunderestimated. Barbados applauds the efforts of all those\r\nassociated with the International Decade for Natural Disaster\r\nReduction, to lessen the vulnerability of those communities\r\nmost susceptible to such disasters. We consider it essential\r\nthat response capabilities in this area be improved with all\r\ndeliberate speed.\r\nBarbados is collaborating closely with the Caribbean\r\nDisaster Preparedness Agency, the Caribbean Regional\r\nSystem, and with the Pan American Health\r\nOrganization/World Health Organization to continue to\r\nimprove its capacity to bounce back from the effects of a\r\ngrade five-hurricane or to be able to come to the aid of any\r\nof our Caribbean neighbours who may fall victim to any\r\nnatural disasters. I am happy to be able to report that across\r\nour region we have succeeded to some degree, at great\r\nexpenditure of effort and resources, in improving our\r\ncapability to mitigate the effects of natural disasters.\r\nBarbados supports wholeheartedly the current initiative\r\nof the United Nations to fashion a safer environment for all.\r\nThe Organization is now called upon to expand its activities\r\nover wide areas of the globe. The new freedom of action\r\nreflects the current geopolitical reality. A new configuration\r\nof power is taking shape. While it is too early to determine\r\nthe outcome we must seek to mould this new phenomenon\r\ninto an instrument for the preservation of peace and security\r\nand for the alleviation of human suffering everywhere.\r\nThe Secretary-General has not missed an opportunity in\r\nrecent times to highlight the dichotomy with which he is\r\nfaced. He continues to point out that additional mandates\r\nare being heaped upon the Organization as a result of the\r\nnew climate without a corresponding willingness to provide\r\nadequate resources for their execution. Barbados strongly\r\nsupports the expressions of concern by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We urge all Member States to do the best they can\r\nto correct this unsatisfactory situation. It is clear that there\r\nare some States whose capacity to pay may temporarily\r\noutstrip their actual ability to pay, but it is unconscionable\r\nfor those who can pay not to do so. I trust, Mr. President,\r\nthat under your expert guidance the General Assembly will\r\nfinally be able to take appropriate measures to address the\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 13\r\nfinancial crisis threatening the very existence of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nBarbados accepts that the Security Council must always\r\nbe allowed to function without unnecessary hindrance. We\r\nrecognize equally clearly the principle of accountability.\r\nThe Council has served its purpose well in the past, but\r\nchanging times and circumstances dictate the need for an\r\nenhanced participation.\r\nTwenty-seven years ago as a member of my country’s\r\nfirst delegation, I sat in this Hall and listened to the then\r\nPrime Minister, the Right Honourable Errol Barrow, deliver\r\nhis inaugural address to the Assembly at its twenty-first\r\nsession.\r\nIn the intervening years though much has changed\r\nmuch has remained the same. Small countries like mine still\r\nbelong to the submerged two thirds of the world’s\r\npopulation, and where we manage by our own painful efforts\r\nto raise our living standards we are faced with the prospect\r\nof graduation. To be faced with graduation on the one hand\r\nand structural adjustment on the other is to be caught\r\nbetween Scylla and Charybdis. Once again Barbados would\r\nurge with all the power at its command that the constant\r\nthreat of graduation be lifted from the vulnerable economies\r\nof small, developing countries.\r\nIn looking back over those 27 years with their ups and\r\ndowns, their triumphs and disappointments, through\r\nprosperity and adversity, graduation and structural\r\nadjustment, as Mr. Barrow was on that day, I too am\r\nreminded of John Bunyan’s Mr. Valiant For Truth when he\r\nsaid:\r\n\"Tho with great difficulty I am got hither,\r\nYet now I do not repent me of all the trouble I have\r\nbeen at to arrive where I am.\"\r\nMr. GATTI (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): More than 12 months ago,\r\naddressing the Assembly, which since then has seen a steady\r\nincrease in its membership, with the admission of new\r\nMembers that I welcome today with great pleasure, I\r\nexpressed my personal satisfaction and that of the people of\r\nthe Republic of San Marino over the momentous changes\r\nthat have marked these past hectic years.\r\nToday, however, we face the pressing and serious\r\nproblem of managing those changes. It is of fundamental\r\nimportance to those peoples who have seen the laying of the\r\nfoundations of the edifice called \"Democracy\" that this\r\nprocess continue and be shored up by solid institutions. The\r\nstrengthening of those institutions must be accomplished to\r\nguarantee the solidity of that essential edifice, which may be\r\naltered or changed in some of its parts, but which cannot be\r\ndeprived of its foundations.\r\nToday more than ever, the importance of democratic\r\ninstitutions must be acknowledged, upheld and stressed.\r\nNow more than ever, peoples need to be assured that\r\nstruggles for power, those between factions and those caused\r\nby ethnic, economic and political interests, will be averted\r\nfor ever so that real peace may be made, restored and\r\nmaintained.\r\nMy country is convinced that a renewed commitment\r\nof the United Nations is necessary for the attainment of this\r\naim, in virtue of the role it plays as a universal factor that\r\nhas become a real point of reference for the entire world.\r\nNot even the most advanced democratic society can\r\nfully meet the needs arising out of the exercise of freedom.\r\nIn my opinion, however, any form of political regime other\r\nthan democracy would deprive man of his freedom to an\r\neven greater degree. Democracy, even in its initial and most\r\nincomplete forms, is organized in such a way that\r\nindividuals may take part, directly or indirectly, in the\r\nexercise of power.\r\nFurther development of the existing democratic régime\r\nis a precise commitment that my country has undertaken in\r\nan attempt to find a solution to one of the consequences of\r\nthe past emigration of its citizens. I am referring to the\r\nefforts we are making to facilitate the exercise of their right\r\nand duty to participate in political life through their votes.\r\nIn our attempts to solve this problem the relevant\r\ninternational instruments of the United Nations will be a\r\nprecise point of reference and an irreplaceable guide.\r\nI am following with particular interest the discussion\r\nunder way on the possibility of reforming the institutional\r\nmechanisms of the Organization. It is undoubtedly wise to\r\nadapt institutions to present circumstances, so that they will\r\nrespond effectively to the new challenges. San Marino\r\nsupports those reforms, prompted by the conviction that\r\nwider participation leads to more effective and shared\r\ninterventions. That is why with my country is following\r\nwith special attention the application submitted by Sweden,\r\nin its capacity as Chairman-in-Office of the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), for the CSCE’s\r\nadmission to the United Nations with Observer States. That\r\napplication enjoys the full support of all participating States,\r\nand I wish to express here the desire of my country to see\r\nit accepted.\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe CSCE continues to play a leading role in Europe\r\nin favour of peace and the safeguarding of human rights.\r\nCloser cooperation with the United Nations has now become\r\nindispensable, and it will surely produce positive results.\r\nThe initial task of the United Nations was to lay down\r\nthe fundamental principles for the protection of human\r\ndignity and for a peaceful, democratic and civil coexistence.\r\nIt then undertook a wider-ranging task, in light of the\r\nevolution of rights and of those systems established for their\r\nsafeguard. Now the Organization must intensify its\r\nintervention straightforwardly and incisively in order to\r\nresolve critical situations.\r\nThe policy of pursuing the peaceful solution, resorting\r\nto negotiations, mediation and political diplomatic initiatives,\r\nis unquestionably the right course. That is the path to follow\r\nin our times; it is policy of a democratic society in which\r\nreason must always prevail.\r\nRecourse to force, even when it seems indispensable to\r\nmaintain or restore democracy, is always an unfair and\r\ndangerous option, since it takes a heavy toll of lives and\r\ncreates grounds for revenge that are risky and difficult to\r\ndispel and may always trigger civil wars.\r\nI truly hope we will not have to say one day that the\r\nmagic moment when our dreams seemed to have become\r\nreality has passed us by. We must persist in averting the\r\ndangerous strategy of nuclear deterrence.\r\nIf we manage to create a world with collective security\r\nas its prevailing feature, there will no longer be grounds for\r\nconflicts. Peace, however, does not depend exclusively on\r\nthe possession of weapons and on the thirst for supremacy.\r\nToday, more than ever, peace depends on solidarity, on\r\nrespect for rights and on our efforts in favour of tolerance.\r\nEurope is plagued by conflicts that offend peoples,\r\nminorities, women, children and the poor. Every continent\r\nis afflicted by wars and deep crises, which have become so\r\nendemic as to arouse the suspicion that they have been\r\naccepted as the norm. Some of the conflicts have become\r\nso acute that even humane acts, solidarity and the most\r\nindispensable interventions against hunger and cold seem\r\nnow to have faded into the background.\r\nExhausting and sincere mediation initiatives fail; crisis-\r\nmanagement becomes impossible; the solution of conflicts\r\nseems unattainable, despite the growing number of political,\r\ndiplomatic and military missions, and even relief missions\r\nare hindered in the performance of their work.\r\nSan Marino believes that the United Nations has the\r\nability, the authority and the structures to formulate a\r\ndynamic and effective plan able to prevent and solve\r\nconflicts, manage crises and maintain peace.\r\nThe authority and the means of the Organization may\r\nsometimes not involve military choices. In any case, such\r\ninterventions can be justified only when all possibilities of\r\na peaceful solution have been considered and it is borne in\r\nmind that resort to this option must not cause victims.\r\nCrises and conflicts may be averted by eliminating their\r\nroot causes. When riches are not fairly distributed; when all\r\ncitizens do not enjoy the same rights and duties; when rights\r\nand freedoms are not respected; when it is forgotten that\r\nminorities are composed of individuals; when a distinction\r\nis made between the dignity of man and that of woman;\r\nwhen injustice exists; when man and his rights do not prevail\r\nover the organization of the State and its military apparatus;\r\nthen conflicts inevitably arise.\r\nThe key principle of the United Nations, which has\r\nalways fascinated the people of the Republic of San Marino\r\nand has now become our trusted point of reference, is that\r\nof the indissoluble bond between personal freedom and the\r\nliberty of all peoples. That freedom must be based on a\r\ncomplex system of limits so that no man, in the exercise of\r\nhis rights, can ride roughshod over the rights of another.\r\nIn that spirit the Republic of San Marino recently\r\nwelcomed with sincere satisfaction the agreement of mutual\r\nrecognition signed by the State of Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO). That agreement, concerning\r\nan area that has been theatre of war for a very long time,\r\nwas reached through peaceful negotiations and political\r\nmediation in which both sides gave up something to\r\nfacilitate the peace process.\r\nThis major event is an important point of reference, a\r\nproof of the existing good will and wish for certainty,\r\nconfirming that this is the only possible way to resolve\r\nconflicts.\r\nMy country is convinced that many challenges have yet\r\nto be met and still await effective solutions. We have to\r\nexert our best endeavours to defend the poor from\r\nunderdevelopment, to sustain and contribute to their progress\r\nby restoring to them, when the situation so requires, the\r\nenvironment of which they have been deprived as a\r\nconsequence of ecological degradation. Every man is a\r\nguardian of the world and is entitled to ask that it be used\r\ncorrectly.\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 15\r\nWe must express solidarity in the forms that such a\r\nhumanitarian and understanding attitude requires, respecting\r\nthe dignity of peoples and their freedom to make their own\r\nchoices and determine their own destinies.\r\nWe must play a fundamental role in educating future\r\ngenerations on mutual understanding, respect and tolerance.\r\nThis is the challenge facing the entire world and Europe in\r\nparticular. Together we will have to overcome the\r\nconsequences of intolerance to which we have given the\r\nnames of racism, \"ethnic cleansing\", mass migrations, refuge\r\nand asylum.\r\nThe people of San Marino are following with particular\r\nconcern all issues related to minorities, their inalienable right\r\nto free existence and well-balanced development, respect for\r\ntheir cultures and religions, and the real exercise of these\r\nrights under the same conditions enjoyed by the majorities.\r\nThe reason for this special interest is probably to be found\r\nin the numerically small population of my country, which\r\nhistory has always taught to offer hospitality and express\r\nsolidarity with the weak, the oppressed and the victims of\r\npersecution.\r\nToday this problem has reached proportions that might\r\nbecome alarming. Nobody knows how many people may\r\nbe forced in the future to leave their native countries in\r\norder to survive, whether in flight from underdevelopment\r\nand hunger or prompted by the desire for freedom. Thus,\r\nthe problem has two faces. The first is the fact that no one\r\nshould be forced to leave his home and country; the second\r\nis the fact that all people, to the extent their circumstances\r\npermit, must be willing to offer hospitality in a spirit of\r\nsolidarity and brotherhood.\r\nHaving referred to this problem, I cannot fail to\r\nmention the situation affecting the former Yugoslavia, the\r\ncoast of which can be seen, when the air is clear, from the\r\nmountain on which the Republic of San Marino is situated.\r\nWho knows the destiny of that poor people or when this\r\nunacceptable war will finally end? I appeal to the General\r\nAssembly, to all States of the world and to the United\r\nNations that we put a halt to the catastrophe. Let us\r\nreiterate and strengthen within our own nations a sense of\r\ntolerance undertaken as a duty and not as a right.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.15 p.m.\r\n"
