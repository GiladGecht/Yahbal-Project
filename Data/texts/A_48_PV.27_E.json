"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n27thth\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nTuesday, 12 October 1993\r\nat 3 p.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. CARDOSO (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\ninterpretation from French text furnished by the delegation):\r\nAllow me at the outset, Sir, to offer you my warmest\r\ncongratulations on your well-deserved election to the\r\npresidency of the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations. Your presence at the head\r\nof this Assembly clearly attests to the commitment of your\r\ncountry - Guyana - to the defence of peace and the\r\npromotion of multilateral diplomacy. Your skills and your\r\nexperience on the international scene, acquired over many\r\nyears, will, we are certain, ensure the successful conclusion\r\nof our deliberations. My country, Guinea-Bissau, wishes to\r\nassure you of our fullest readiness to cooperate with you.\r\nOur congratulations and thanks go to your predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the remarkable and\r\nconstructive job he did in steering the work of the forty-\r\nseventh session. We wish also to express our gratitude to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, for the way in which he is\r\ndirecting the work of the Organization in this new context.\r\nWe hail the advent of new Members to the great family\r\nof the United Nations: Andorra, Monaco, Eritrea, the Czech\r\nRepublic, Slovakia and The Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia.\r\nI am particularly honoured to have the privilege of\r\nspeaking on behalf of my country, Guinea-Bissau, at the\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly at a time when\r\nan increased worldwide consensus seems to be emerging, in\r\nthat significant and encouraging changes are taking place in\r\nthe global political and economic landscape.\r\nHow many questions, expectations and, indeed, how\r\nmuch skepticism underlie that assertion?\r\nThe end of the bipolar domination of international\r\nrelations and the cessation of the cold war, which affected\r\nall continents, constitute an event that is of manifest political\r\nsignificance and of great historical impact - first, because it\r\nhas led to the dismantling of an international order that\r\nprevailed for half a century and divided the world into\r\nhostile blocs; secondly, because it has cleared a space for the\r\ndevelopment of certain processes whose free evolution was\r\nimpeded because of the political discipline imposed, within\r\neach bloc, by the demands of the conflicts between the two\r\nsuper-Powers.\r\nThe world power pattern has changed. This has led to\r\na shift in certain countries’ relative positions in the economic\r\nand political hierarchy. The very nature of the relations\r\nbetween these countries is changing. However, the rules and\r\npractices that will constitute the basis of the new\r\ninternational order have not yet been defined.\r\nAs happens in periods of history marked by great\r\nchanges - especially unpredictable changes - we are now\r\nwitnessing the emergence of factors that give rise to both\r\nintegration and disintegration, to the order and disorder that\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86855 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.27\r\n3 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nare alternating in international behaviour and in the conduct\r\nof international affairs. The new and old orders are fighting\r\nfor primacy in the development of an international system,\r\nand it is no longer easy to distinguish between the past and\r\nthe future.\r\nThe new international context gives rise to considerable\r\nanxiety, especially as it poses several questions that have not\r\nyet been answered. For example, it is not clear how\r\npolitical hegemony can be exercised in a system that has\r\nbecome multipolar; strong tendencies towards globalization\r\nand towards regionalization are emerging on the international\r\nscene, and one wonders how these can be reconciled; the\r\nnation State’s decision-making capacity is limited by\r\ntransnational players, and its prerogatives of sovereignty are\r\nbeing ceded in order that it may be incorporated into broader\r\npolitical and economic entities, even as ancient ethnic groups\r\nare claiming the right to be regarded as nation States; one\r\nsees increasing capitalist competition in a situation in which\r\neconomic interdependence imposes new parameters for the\r\nsettlement of conflicts of interest; one is witnessing a world-\r\nwide heightening of awareness of the responsibility of us all\r\nwith regard to ecological matters, and, at the same time, one\r\nhas to deal with the means of sharing responsibility between\r\nthe various countries.\r\nThis is hardly an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to\r\ndemonstrate the extent to which the international agenda is\r\nbeing broadened and made more complicated. The future of\r\nmany countries will depend on the items on that agenda and\r\non our capacity to organize our approach to them.\r\nGiven this situation, it is absolutely vital that the closest\r\npossible contact between nations be maintained by means of\r\nthe exchange of information, joint thinking and discussion,\r\nso that awareness of the changes that are under way and of\r\ntheir possible impact on a continent such as Africa may be\r\ndeepened.\r\nAt the beginning of my statement, I mentioned the\r\nemergence of a universal consensus that has stemmed form\r\nthe changes in the international system. The wide prospects\r\nthat have opened up, in terms of the peaceful settlement of\r\nconflicts and the elimination of tension in regions such as\r\nsouthern Africa, western Africa, the Maghreb, Central\r\nEurope, Eastern Europe and Asia, lead us to believe that this\r\nprocess, which is marked by the strong resolve of the\r\ninternational community to achieve lasting peace, will not\r\nturn out to be a short-term symptom of a world in upheaval.\r\nThe situation prevailing in Angola is still a matter of\r\nmajor concern to Guinea-Bissau. My Government welcomes\r\nthe unanimous adoption, by the Security Council of the\r\nUnited Nations, of resolution 864 (1993), which is a logical\r\nfollow-up to earlier resolutions that aim at the restoration of\r\npeace to Angola. We are convinced that only dialogue can\r\nlead to a lasting solution that will result in the return of\r\npeace to that country. The parties to the conflict should\r\ncomply in full with the obligations resulting from the\r\nagreements that have been signed and from the Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. This is the only possible way to end\r\nthe suffering of the Angolan people and to respond to their\r\nlegitimate desire for peace and democracy.\r\nWith regard to Mozambique, we should like to express\r\nour concern at the slowness with which the Peace\r\nAgreement is being implemented. We encourage the parties\r\nconcerned to continue their efforts to strengthen peace and\r\nnational unity. Further, we exhort the international\r\ncommunity to continue its support for that process.\r\nIn South Africa, the abolition of the legislative pillars\r\nof apartheid is a positive step. It is now important that the\r\nlast obstacles, including those caused by the climate of\r\nviolence, be removed to make possible negotiations towards\r\nthe creation of a non-racial and democratic South Africa.\r\nW e h a v e w e l c o m e d w i t h s a t i s f a c t i o n\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela’s appeal concerning the lifting of\r\nsanctions against South Africa.\r\nThe tragedy that, daily, besets the Somali people gives\r\nus reason for great anxiety. We urge all the parties\r\nconcerned to end the hostilities and to commit themselves to\r\nnegotiation. We are convinced that the peace-keeping\r\nactivities in Somalia, within the framework of the United\r\nNations Operation in Somalia (UNISOM II), should, above\r\nall, serve the interests of the Somali people and strengthen\r\nthe fragile process of national reconciliation that is under\r\nway.\r\nWe happily welcome the positive developments in\r\nLiberia - in particular, the signing, at Cotonou, of the Peace\r\nAgreement, including the provision for the establishment of\r\na central transitional Government. However, we regret the\r\nwidespread adverse effects the Liberian war has had on the\r\nterritory of neighbouring countries. We express the hope\r\nthat all the protagonists on the Liberian political scene will\r\npersevere in the consolidation of peace by making every\r\neffort towards reconstruction of their country.\r\nIn the Maghreb, the constructive position taken by the\r\nKingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front makes it\r\npossible to be optimistic about developments in the situation\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 3\r\nin Western Sahara and about the prospects for organizing a\r\nreferendum under United Nations auspices.\r\nGuinea-Bissau watches with concern the conflict that is\r\nlaying waste the territory of the former Yugoslavia. We\r\nbelieve that only an agreement acceptable to all parties\r\ninvolved in the conflict will put an end to this bloody\r\nepisode. My Government regrets that the latest Geneva talks\r\non peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina did not yield the\r\nexpected results. We hope that the parties will adopt more\r\nflexible positions with a view to bringing about the signing\r\nof a peace agreement.\r\nGuinea-Bissau believes that the solution to this\r\nfratricidal conflict must be sought by peaceful means. That\r\nis why we continue to support the United Nations and the\r\nEuropean Community’s negotiating effort and welcome the\r\nSecurity Council’s adoption of resolution 827 (1993) on the\r\nestablishment of an International Tribunal.\r\nIn the case of East Timor, we urge the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to continue his efforts with the parties concerned\r\naimed at finding a peaceful, negotiated solution to this issue.\r\nIn the Middle East, peace is now possible thanks to the\r\nrapprochement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization. We greet the Washington agreement with\r\nsatisfaction and renewed hope. We encourage the parties to\r\ncontinue negotiations with a view to establishing a lasting\r\npeace throughout the region.\r\nThe reunification of China is in essence the sole\r\nconcern of the Chinese people. In our opinion, the\r\ninternational community should turn its attention to the need\r\nto recognize the fundamental rights of the 21 million\r\ninhabitants of the Republic of China.\r\nThe poverty and social injustice that are the sorry lot of\r\na large portion of humankind are amongst the underlying\r\ncauses of the conflicts that constantly threaten the world’s\r\npeace and stability. The ideological tensions of the cold war\r\nseem likely to be replaced by new tensions, this time\r\neconomic in origin, if adequate precautions are not taken.\r\nThe United Nations must of course strengthen its structure\r\nfor maintaining world peace and security, but it must also\r\nplay a leading role in helping to build a stable economic\r\nsystem and promoting the development of the developing\r\ncountries, particularly that of the least developed countries.\r\nThis is without question the best and most effective form of\r\npreventive diplomacy.\r\nThe economic situation in Africa is becoming more and\r\nmore worrying. Today, on the eve of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, incomes in sub-Saharan Africa average $490 per\r\nperson per year, in other words, they are the lowest in the\r\nworld. The average figure masks great disparities between\r\ncountries: Africa is the only region in the world where the\r\nnumber of people living in poverty is likely to increase\r\nmarkedly before the year 2000. Trends in the world\r\neconomy lead us to predict that the situation will get worse.\r\nBlack Africa’s share of world trade has plummeted\r\nfrom 3.8 per cent in 1970 to 1 per cent now, which has\r\nentailed Africa’s being relegated to the sidelines in\r\ninternational relations. Despite plentiful labour and\r\ninvestment opportunities, direct investment from the most\r\nindustrialized countries is in flight from the least developed\r\ncountries towards the advanced economies. Sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica receives about 6 per cent of direct investment, which\r\nis profitable essentially for those few countries with oil\r\nand/or strategically important minerals.\r\nRestrictions on international trade as a result of various\r\nprotectionist practices and of subsidy policies for the\r\nindustrialized countries’ agricultural products are imposing\r\nsevere limitations on the underdeveloped countries’ export\r\nopportunities. In this regard, can we hope that the Uruguay\r\nRound negotiations, if they succeed, will spare humankind\r\nthe possible unpleasant aftermath of discriminatory practices\r\non the part of the trading blocs?\r\nWe wish to make an appeal that the next round of\r\nnegotiations be planned to have all the relevance that the\r\nsituation requires. In the meanwhile, it is painful for us to\r\nsee how those who recommend to us that we should\r\nliberalize trade if we want to get our economies moving\r\nagain can, in the blink of an eye, become fervent defenders\r\nof protectionism when they are convinced that they are\r\ndefending their own interests that way. Liberal policies in\r\nthe countries of the South have not a hope of succeeding\r\nunless the countries of the North systematically dismantle\r\ntheir protectionist barriers and open up their markets.\r\nThe transition to effective and lasting market economies\r\nrequires further buttressing from the international\r\ncommunity. Most of the underdeveloped countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa, have recognized the errors that were\r\ncommitted in their post-colonial economic management.\r\nThey have therefore embarked, with the assistance of the\r\ninternational financial organizations and other partners\r\nabroad, on radical economic reforms aimed at laying the\r\nfoundations for economic growth and development.\r\nEnormous political and social costs have had to be borne in\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncarrying out these reforms, but the will to succeed is still\r\nthere despite all the odds against it.\r\nUnfortunately, these efforts have been overwhelmed by\r\nthe massive reductions in financial assistance from the\r\nindustrialized countries and the multilateral organizations.\r\nThe target set by the United Nations for official development\r\nassistance (ODA), 0.7 per cent of gross national product\r\n(GNP), has scarcely been complied with at all. At the\r\nmoment, only an infinitesimal fraction of ODA is being\r\nallocated to the poorest countries and even less than that to\r\nthe priority sectors that are most likely to trigger\r\ndevelopment. ODA must be restructured if the problem of\r\npoverty and lasting development is to be tackled. We must\r\ntake the risk and have faith in a renewed Africa with a new\r\neconomic management mind-set.\r\nJudging by the number of international conferences and\r\nmeetings on Africa that are held each year and the feeble\r\nway they make available finance to root out the evils they\r\ndeplore so much, we could be right in saying that we live in\r\na real consumer society for intellectual products, that is.\r\nPeople are at last beginning to wake up to the fact that these\r\ninternational meetings, although they sometimes do succeed\r\nin making world public opinion aware of one or another\r\naspect of underdevelopment, have not contributed very much\r\nat all towards eliminating the great scourge of\r\nunderdevelopment itself.\r\nNot only does the way economic and financial\r\nopportunities are being distributed throughout the world\r\nprovide the less developed countries with piffling amounts\r\nof resources, even worse than that is the way colossal\r\namounts are being clawed back from them, particularly\r\nthrough those notorious debt-servicing costs. Total debt as\r\na percentage of GNP stands at over 100 per cent, and debt-\r\nservicing costs are over 20 per cent and even 50 per cent in\r\nsome cases. As a result, several African countries are\r\nunable to maintain the infrastructures for production or the\r\nsocial services that are vital to development.\r\nTraditional approaches to solving the debt problem,\r\nwhile they have granted some countries a few months’\r\nbreathing space, would none the less appear to have\r\nexacerbated the problem, since Africa’s debt burden has\r\ngone on growing, by about 10 per cent over the last decade.\r\nThis is extremely worrying.\r\nHow can we allot more financial resources to\r\ndeveloping our human resources, involving women in\r\ndevelopment and protecting the environment if at the same\r\ntime the donors are mounting pressures to have the debt paid\r\nback, operate unfavourable trade policies and cut back their\r\nassistance? My country believes that major steps absolutely\r\nmust be taken if we want the low-income countries not to\r\nmiss the boat for economic modernization and development.\r\nThe Trinidad conclusions, which propose canceling two\r\nthirds of the eligible debt coupled with a rescheduling of the\r\nremainder over 25 years and an additional five-year grace\r\nperiod, offer a promising and encouraging approach to\r\neasing the debt burden. However, the Trinidad conclusions\r\nshould also be applied to multilateral debt, which now\r\naccounts for one third of debt servicing costs.\r\nIf our planet is to have lasting security, there must be\r\na collective effort to combat the endogenous and exogenous\r\nfactors that nowadays condemn the majority of the world’s\r\npopulation to absolute poverty. If this poverty persists, its\r\nconsequences will ultimately spill over borders in the form\r\nof migration, terrorism, drugs and crime of all kinds.\r\nAfrica’s economy is worsening to such an extent that\r\nwe must break with routine thinking and devise new\r\ninstruments and methods in order to understand and properly\r\nrespond to the needs of a continent which is economically in\r\nanguish. Unfortunately, it is clear that technological\r\nadvances, which should contribute to improving the human\r\nlot everywhere, are actually creating an increasingly greater\r\ngulf between those who have mastered that technology and\r\nthose who are trying to enter into the technological age. The\r\ndevelopment of science and technology ill-suited to our\r\nneeds is contributing to a reduction in the demand for\r\ncommodities and is consequently further worsening the terms\r\nof trade.\r\nGiven all these issues, does this Organization not have\r\na role to play in mitigating the negative effects on the least-\r\ndeveloped countries of the rapid globalization of production\r\nand sophisticated technological systems? This is the very\r\nfoundation of the preventive diplomacy that the United\r\nNations has advocated.\r\nThe prospects for development are also threatened by\r\nthe staggering pace of the degradation of the environment.\r\nThe degradation of natural resources and ecosystems poses\r\na major threat to humankind.\r\nFor Africa, which still depends on natural resources for\r\nits survival, this situation involves grave consequences likely\r\nto hamper medium-term economic recovery programmes if\r\nurgent measures are not taken and the appropriate means\r\nmobilized. With national budgets already truncated, African\r\ncountries will find it very difficult to face these challenges\r\nunaided in the absence of an increase in international\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 5\r\nassistance, properly programmed and managed so as to\r\nensure the rational development and regulation of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe economic difficulties faced by most of the\r\ncountries of the South have markedly diminished their ability\r\nto act together and in a coordinated manner. Domestic\r\neconomic challenges, instead of promoting the mobilization\r\nof forces and resources in a regional or subregional context,\r\noften lead to a tendency by these countries to turn inward.\r\nThis tendency has been compounded by structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes designed and executed in a strictly national\r\ncontext, with the aim of upgrading short-term indicators of\r\nmacroeconomic and financial performance. The chances for\r\nsustainable development in the developing countries and\r\nparticularly in the least-developed countries could be\r\nincreased by strengthened programmes of regional and\r\nsubregional integration and cooperation.\r\nIn this respect, we welcome the efforts of the European\r\nEconomic Community, in the framework of the Lomé IV\r\nConvention, to lay the foundation for closer economic\r\ncooperation between the five Portuguese-speaking countries\r\nof Africa, despite the fact that they are not geographically\r\ncontiguous. In this context, strengthening the ties of\r\nfriendship and cooperation with Portugal and Brazil will\r\nmake it possible to develop a special kind of relationship\r\nbetween these countries, all of which use the Portuguese\r\nlanguage.\r\nIt has now been clearly acknowledged that the active\r\nparticipation of peoples in political, economic and social life\r\nis an essential prerequisite for releasing creative energy and\r\nenriching cultural values and people’s ability to take control\r\nof its own destiny. Mindful of this fact, Guinea-Bissau, like\r\nother countries of our continent, has opted for democracy as\r\none of the means to mobilize its full human and physical\r\npotential in the struggle against underdevelopment. In this\r\nrespect, the appropriate legal and institutional machinery has\r\nbeen established, with a view to promoting a political system\r\nbased on consensus and the rule of the majority and on a\r\ntransparent and effective public administration.\r\nThe democratic process, to be credible, must mesh with\r\nthe socio-cultural heritage of a region or a country.\r\nVirtually everywhere in Africa, we are witnessing the\r\nemergence of new forces for change which are in the\r\nvanguard of democracy: civilian societies, especially free-\r\nassociation and cooperative movements; non-governmental\r\norganizations; and civic associations.\r\nDespite some short-term obstacles, political pluralism\r\nin Guinea-Bissau is, without the shadow of a doubt, an\r\nirreversible process. One of its stages will culminate in the\r\nholding of the first multi-party elections, scheduled for 27\r\nMarch 1994. To ensure the greatest possible transparency in\r\nthese elections, the Government is taking all the steps\r\nnecessary to prepare for them, with the support of its foreign\r\npartners. In this context, international observers will be\r\ninvited to assist in the organization of the elections, and we\r\nlook forward to receiving increased support from the\r\ninternational community at the appropriate time.\r\nSustained support for these new forces of change is\r\nabsolutely vital if we wish to bolster new democracies and\r\nexplicitly affirm our commitment to the protection of human\r\nrights.\r\nThe challenges facing the United Nations in terms of\r\nmaintaining international peace and stability while at the\r\nsame time promoting economic and social development in a\r\nrapidly changing world require that profound changes be\r\nmade in its structure. These changes should take into\r\naccount the interests of all the components. More than ever,\r\ninternational cooperation has become an opportunity to\r\ncreate lasting peace, to strengthen protection for the dignity\r\nof human beings everywhere, and to safeguard the rights,\r\nprofound aspirations and well-being of present and future\r\ngenerations.\r\nFor its part, Guinea-Bissau, faithful to the principles\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and determined to\r\nmake its contribution to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, solemnly reaffirms its firm commitment\r\nto pursue this course. We are convinced that the task of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security is a\r\nresponsibility incumbent on the whole of the international\r\ncommunity, on all countries large and small, in conformity\r\nwith the principle of the sovereign equality of States.\r\nIt is against this backdrop that my country has\r\npresented its candidacy as a non-permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council, and we ask all Member States to support\r\nus.\r\nGuinea-Bissau is admittedly a small country, but its\r\nfirm resolve to contribute to the attainment of the objectives\r\nof this Organization is widely known. Our presence at this\r\ntime - in the framework of United Nations Missions - in\r\nAngola, Mozambique, Liberia, Cambodia, Haiti and in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, in both the civilian and the military\r\nspheres, is a clear illustration of this assertion.\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMr. YOUNG (St. Vincent and the Grenadines):\r\nMr. President, the delegation of St. Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines welcomes your election to preside over the work\r\nof the General Assembly at this its forty-eighth session. By\r\nyour elevation to this exceedingly demanding position, the\r\nGeneral Assembly has acknowledged your well-known\r\npersonal merits, proven ability and professional skills. I am\r\nconfident that you will guide this session to a successful\r\nconclusion of the business before us.\r\nYour country, Guyana, shares a number of common\r\ninterests and affinities with St. Vincent and the Grenadines\r\nand other sister States in the Latin American and Caribbean\r\nregion. It is therefore with a deep sense of pride that we\r\ncongratulate you on your unanimous election and pledge the\r\nfull cooperation of the delegation of St. Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines throughout the difficult and challenging period\r\nahead.\r\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines was pleased to be in the\r\nChair in August 1992 when the Group of Latin American\r\nand Caribbean Countries (GRULAC) unanimously endorsed\r\nthe Caribbean candidature for the Presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. It was the first time\r\nthat the Group had so acted, and I wish to congratulate all\r\nthose who were involved in the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) effort, and to thank all member states of the\r\nGRULAC for their cooperation. We in CARICOM are\r\nsteadfast in our commitments, and this demonstration of\r\nhemispheric solidarity augurs well for continued\r\nstrengthening of our ties, not only in placing candidates in\r\nimportant positions in the international arena, but even more\r\ncritically in promoting and securing the best interests of our\r\nmember countries in the post-cold-war world.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express our deep\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, former\r\nForeign Minister of Bulgaria, for the able and inspired\r\nmanner in which he guided the work of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session .\r\nI wish also to thank the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the extraordinary role he is\r\nplaying in shaping the future of the international system.\r\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the\r\nrepresentatives of the States newly admitted to membership\r\nof the United Nations, namely, the Czech Republic,\r\nSlovakia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,\r\nEritrea, the Principality of Monaco, and Andorra. We\r\nparticularly wish to congratulate the people of Eritrea on\r\nwinning the long battle for their self-determination, and we\r\nexpress the hope that their diligence in the pursuit of\r\npolitical independence will be combined with an appropriate\r\nstrategy for economic achievement.\r\nThe admission of a nation to this body always marks a\r\nsignificant event in the international arena as it takes us\r\nanother step forward towards the objective of universal\r\nrepresentation.\r\nAdherence to the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and the right of the world’s peoples to self-\r\ndetermination are the main barometers used in the admission\r\nof States to membership of this body of nations. However,\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, a nation of over\r\n21 million inhabitants, which today has one of the most\r\nvigorous economies in the world, is excluded from\r\nmembership of the United Nations. In this post-cold-war\r\nera, when a number of countries which once had a single\r\nidentity and representation in this Organization now find\r\nready admission as separate and sovereign members, it is\r\nappropriate that all States capable of maintaining such\r\nsovereign identity be so recognized. Moreover, the Republic\r\nof China on Taiwan has demonstrated its capacity to be in\r\nthe forefront of world economic development and should be\r\nprovided with an opportunity to participate in, and contribute\r\nto, the programmes of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation heralds the signing of the United\r\nNations- brokered Governors Island Accord last July by\r\nPresident Aristide and the military-backed Government of\r\nHaiti, headed by General Raoul Cedras, as an historic\r\nopportunity for the Haitian people, the hemisphere, and the\r\nprinciple of democratic rule. The interim period until\r\nPresident Aristide’s return to Haiti on the 30th of this month\r\nmust be a time for healing and laying the groundwork for a\r\nsmooth take-over, and for a concerted rehabilitation process\r\naimed at bringing some measure of economic and political\r\nstability to that long-suffering country.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to reiterate our\r\nsolidarity with the Haitian people, who have struggled over\r\nthe past months amidst persistent and blatant human rights\r\nabuses and political repression. We hail the efforts and\r\ninitiatives taken by the United Nations, the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, and the Government of the United States\r\nof America in bringing the usurpation of authority to an end.\r\nLet us pray that the clear message from the resolution of the\r\nHaitian crisis by international response will halt the\r\nambitions of the various military aspirants there.\r\nAs the United Nations moves to perform its\r\npeace-keeping, peacemaking and peace-enforcing roles in\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 7\r\nmany troubled areas around the world, harassment, beatings\r\nand murder of its personnel, both civilian and military, are\r\non the rise. Earlier in the year a number of United Nations\r\npersonnel in the Middle East and Cambodia were slain.\r\nThese killings followed the murder of a nurse working with\r\nthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine\r\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Gaza and of a\r\nUnited Nations driver in Afghanistan. This year the world\r\nhas also been shocked by the deaths of a number of\r\nPakistanis, Italians, Moroccans, Americans and nationals of\r\nother countries serving in the United Nations Operation in\r\nSomalia (UNOSOM).\r\nMy Government takes this opportunity to express its\r\ncondolences to the Governments and peoples of those\r\ncountries whose nationals paid the ultimate price in their\r\ndesire to bring peace and deliver humanitarian assistance to\r\nthe suffering peoples of the world. We also wish to express\r\nour sympathy to the bereaved families of all those United\r\nNations personnel who died in the line of duty. Member\r\nStates must be reminded of their responsibility to protect\r\nUnited Nations workers and of their obligation to act\r\npromptly and effectively to deter, prosecute and punish all\r\nthose responsible for violence.\r\nWe salute the courage and commitment of those\r\ndedicated people who continue to accept considerable\r\npersonal risks in order to carry out United Nations missions.\r\nThe international community must take appropriate steps to\r\nprotect its members and we eagerly await the submission of\r\nconcrete proposals designed to enhance the safety and\r\nsecurity of United Nations forces and personnel.\r\nIt is evident that the perceived disarray in the United\r\nNations military operation in Somalia is fuelling instability\r\nin the country and detracting from the achievement of the\r\noriginal goals of restoring peace and security and ensuring\r\nthe distribution of humanitarian relief, thereby paving the\r\nway for the re-establishment of civil society in the country\r\nat large. Naturally, these objectives cannot be achieved\r\nunless the international community continues to work in\r\nearnest to ensure that disarmament is achieved throughout\r\nthe country in conformity with the provisions of the Addis\r\nAbaba agreement of March 1993, to which all factions are\r\nsignatories.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation is of the view that\r\nappropriate measures must be taken against those who\r\ncontinue to impede disarmament, in direct contravention of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and the Addis Ababa\r\nagreement. My delegation welcomes signs of a willingness\r\nto negotiate on the part of rebel forces.\r\nFrom this point on all actions by the United Nations in\r\nSomalia should be aimed at winning the trust of the Somali\r\npeople as a prerequisite to the re-establishment of peace and\r\nsecurity, national reconciliation, restoration of the Somali\r\nState and the reconstruction and development of the country.\r\nMy delegation congratulates the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO), under the leadership of Mr. Yasser\r\nArafat, on concluding an agreement with the Rabin\r\nGovernment of Israel to end hostilities among their peoples.\r\nWe see this as a significant first step that will fail unless it\r\nleads to the implementation of the resolutions long agreed to\r\nin the United Nations on the territories occupied by Israel\r\nand the acceptance by the United Nations of Palestine to\r\nmembership. Just as my delegation has persistently endorsed\r\nthe right of Israel to exist within secure borders, we assert\r\nthe same right for Palestine. At the forty-fifth session of the\r\nAssembly, when we were discussing the invasion of Kuwait,\r\nmy delegation called on this body to demonstrate consistency\r\nin responding to its resolutions, and we do so again.\r\nWe wish to congratulate the Government of Norway on\r\nthe pivotal and historic facilitating role they played in the\r\nprocess of mediating in the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. We\r\nadmire the dignified manner of their contribution and\r\nsubsequent response.\r\nThe rapidly deteriorating situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina cries out for urgent resolution. The state of\r\naffairs cannot be tolerated much longer. Immeasurable harm\r\nin both human and material terms has already been done,\r\nand the Serbs and Croats appear to be bent on the\r\ndismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina through border\r\nchanges, by force and by ethnic cleansing. The international\r\ncommunity cannot agree to a solution dictated by the Serbs\r\nand Croats at the expense of the Bosnian Muslims. We also\r\ncannot accept any territorial solution unless it has the\r\nagreement of the three parties. My delegation wishes to\r\nstate unequivocally that the measures necessary to bring\r\nabout a reversal of the Serbian aggression must include the\r\nimmediate immobilization of heavy weapons, placing them\r\nunder effective international control, and the effective\r\nenforcement of comprehensive sanctions on the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia until all the conditions in the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions are met. My\r\ndelegation calls on all those with the resources to influence\r\na return to normality in this part of the world to honour their\r\nmoral responsibility.\r\nThe end of the cold war has resulted in a new spirit of\r\ncooperation between erstwhile enemies. Ongoing\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nrestructuring of the world body is designed to enhance the\r\ncapacity of the Organization for preventive diplomacy,\r\npeace-keeping and peacemaking. Regrettably, these changes\r\ndo not mean the end of bloody regional conflicts. The strife\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nagorny Karabakh and Liberia\r\ncontinues. In Angola, Sudan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan\r\nthere is conflict and distress.\r\nThe demands on the United Nations for peace-keeping\r\nand peace-building are increasing daily in the number of\r\noperations and personnel as well as in the scope of their\r\nmandates. But in order to bring peace and security to these\r\ntroubled areas the international community must redouble its\r\nefforts to bring about a resolution of their conflicts.\r\nOne of my country’s most important priorities is\r\nsupport for the right of all peoples living under colonial or\r\nalien domination and/or foreign occupation to self-\r\ndetermination and independence. Stressing our commitment\r\nto the goal of the complete eradication of colonialism, we\r\nonce again pledge to strengthen our solidarity with all those\r\ncountries facing aggression or intervention or interference in\r\ntheir internal affairs.\r\nConsistent with this position, we strongly condemn the\r\ncontinuous efforts of certain segments of South African\r\nsociety to perpetuate the system of apartheid. At the same\r\ntime, we welcome the recent progress towards the\r\nestablishment of a non-racial democracy, paving the way for\r\nthe first non-racial elections, scheduled for April 1994, and\r\nthe eventual reintegration of that country into the\r\ninternational political and economic community.\r\nWe welcome the adoption by acclamation on Friday, 8\r\nOctober, of the General Assembly resolution in support of\r\nMr. Nelson Mandela’s call for the immediate lifting of\r\nsanctions against South Africa.\r\nThe delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is\r\nparticularly pleased that four vital pieces of legislation,\r\nsetting up, the Independent Electoral Commission, the\r\nIndependent Media Commission, the Independent\r\nBroadcasting Authority and the Transitional Executive\r\nCouncil have been adopted by both the Negotiating Council\r\nand the South African Parliament, and are in the process of\r\nbeing enacted into law.\r\nWith the changing world environment the Organization\r\nhas been catapulted into new prominence and there has been\r\nrenewed hope, and high expectation, as well as new ideas on\r\nthe functioning of the General Assembly. The same\r\nmovement of change is also of vital importance in the\r\nSecurity Council and in the economic and social fields. Let\r\nus not lose the momentum in our quest to give new life to\r\nthe Organization.\r\nThe General Assembly is a body that has been\r\nfunctioning below the capacity envisaged by its founding\r\nfathers. On the other hand, we have a Security Council that\r\nhas expanded in scope and power without a corresponding\r\nincrease in its membership or a reorganization of its\r\nfunctions. The need has also been established for\r\nstrengthening the role of the Economic and Social Council\r\nthrough a better distribution of its functions and a\r\nrationalization of its activities.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that at a minimum the\r\nSecurity Council should be expanded to allocate permanent\r\nseats to Japan and Germany and up to six new rotating seats\r\nto be filled on a regional basis in order better to reflect the\r\nincreased membership of the United Nations and the\r\nchanged international situation. Certainly, we do not grant\r\nto Japan and Germany the recognition they richly deserve.\r\nThe Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit was about nations\r\njoining together in common resolve to do a better job in the\r\nfuture and to offer our children the hope for a brighter\r\ntomorrow. The centrepiece of this international effort,\r\nAgenda 2l, is a blueprint for our planet which the\r\nGovernments of the world adopted by acclamation. With the\r\ncreation of a Commission on Sustainable Development and\r\nthe restructuring of the economic and social functions of the\r\nUnited Nations, we now have the institutional arrangements\r\nin place to ensure that the measures prescribed by Agenda\r\n21 are adequately addressed.\r\nIn the interim between Rio and the convening of the\r\nfirst substantial session of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, it appeared to many that the spirit of Rio was\r\nbeginning to fade away, due in part to the failure of the\r\nindustrialized countries to make firm financial commitments\r\nto the programme approved at UNCED. There is, however,\r\nrenewed hope because, since the June session of the\r\nCommission, machinery has been firmly put in place to\r\nfollow up on pledges made at the Rio Summit.\r\nThe establishment by the Commission of two working\r\ngroups to tackle the thorny issues of financial flows and\r\ntechnology transfer to the developing countries of the South,\r\nin addition to reviewing mechanisms for innovative financing\r\nof Agenda 21 and for analysing conditions that determine the\r\nflow of financial and economic resources, such as debt\r\nrelief, terms of trade and commodity prices, is a positive\r\napproach, and it should give new impetus to the\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 9\r\nimplementation of the global plan which the Rio Summit\r\nadopted to protect the world from environmental degradation\r\nthrough the twenty-first century. We wish to thank those\r\nwho have contributed to the Global Environment Facility,\r\nwhich makes grant funding available to poor countries so\r\nthat they may properly shoulder their share of environmental\r\nresponsibilities in our global community.\r\nAs we observe new trends in the world economy, it is\r\nnoteworthy that there is potentially greater capacity for\r\ngrowth of real consumption in developing countries than in\r\nthe developed ones. Those of us who live in small island\r\nStates have limited options in response to the international\r\neconomic environment. The banana industry, which is the\r\nlifeline of our economies in Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines and the other countries of the Windward Islands,\r\nis currently under threat of extinction. My delegation wishes\r\nto record, at this session of the General Assembly, our\r\ngratitude to the European Economic Community for its\r\nsupport for this vital component of our economies.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small developing\r\narchipelagic State, with all the generic circumstances\r\nassociated with small size, limited resources, geographical\r\ndispersion and relative isolation from markets. Naturally we\r\nalso have advantages, which we continue to exploit in the\r\nnational interest. Development in all its forms is of\r\nparamount national importance to us. In this regard, we\r\nlook forward with enthusiasm to the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development in 1995, the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development in 1994, and the Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States, which is scheduled to convene in\r\nBarbados in 1994. It is our fervent hope that the\r\ninternational community will recognize the special\r\ncharacteristics and developmental needs of this category of\r\ncountries, which have not changed in the new configuration\r\nof world politics. We pray also that there will be tangible\r\nbenefits following the conclusion of these Conferences.\r\nThe United Nations has designated 1993 the\r\nInternational Year for the World’s Indigenous People.\r\nForced off their ancestral lands by settlers and colonizers,\r\nindigenous peoples in many parts of the world have faced\r\nuntold discrimination and poverty and are often afforded\r\nlittle say in their political future. It is no surprise, therefore,\r\nthat they are increasingly seeking to exercise their full range\r\nof human rights. The world’s communities are urged to\r\ntreat minorities and indigenous peoples, and persons\r\nbelonging to them, on the basis of equality, and to take\r\nmeasures that would, inter alia, facilitate their full\r\nparticipation in all aspects of the political, economic, social,\r\nreligious and cultural life of the society.\r\nMy delegation is proud to state that in Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines the indigenous people, the Caribs, are\r\nfully integrated into Vincentian society and are beneficiaries\r\nof all rights and freedoms under our Constitution. They\r\nparticipate fully in the political process, and today an active\r\nrepresentative in the House of Assembly is a descendant of\r\nJoseph Chatoyer, the Paramount Chief of the Caribs and a\r\nnational hero of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Our\r\nGovernment has also taken specific steps, through its land\r\nreform and distribution policy, to empower the Caribs, who\r\nare the main beneficiaries of the Government’s acquisition\r\nof the area formerly occupied by Orange Hill Estates, and\r\nthe subsequent distribution, with title, of economically viable\r\nplots to them.\r\nMy Government will ensure that our indigenous people\r\ncontinue to participate fully in national society and that their\r\nviews are solicited and taken into consideration in\r\ndecision-making processes that affect them and the nation as\r\na whole.\r\nMy delegation is proud to co-sponsor a draft resolution\r\nof the Standing Committee of Caribbean Ministers\r\nResponsible for Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity calling for the annual observance of an\r\nInternational Day of Indigenous Peoples. I hope that this\r\ndraft resolution, when brought before this body, will be\r\nadopted by acclamation and will receive unanimous\r\nfollow-up support from Member countries.\r\nThe Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\r\nwelcomes and values highly the deepening of relations\r\nbetween the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Latin\r\nAmerica in general. We are also encouraged by the degree\r\nof cooperation which is being developed between\r\nCARICOM and Central America. In the increasingly\r\ncompetitive world environment, which is gradually being\r\ndominated by large trading blocs, it is imperative for our\r\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean to forge closer\r\nties through economic and other forms of functional\r\ncooperation.\r\nMy Government totally condemns the illicit production,\r\ntrafficking in and consumption of drugs. These harbingers\r\nof violent crime and corruption pose a serious threat to the\r\nhealth and well-being of our economies and our people,\r\nendanger our democratic institutions and jeopardize national\r\nand regional security.\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nWe are firmly convinced that only integrated regional\r\nand international efforts can effectively address the drug\r\nproblem, and, accordingly, we stress the need for increased\r\nlocal, regional and international cooperation. Greater\r\nemphasis should be placed on programmes that generate\r\nemployment and income for persons attracted to drug\r\nproduction and trafficking as a means of livelihood. These\r\nshould be pursued concurrently with programmes for the\r\nprevention of drug use and the rehabilitation of drug users.\r\nThe appropriate measures must also be taken to strengthen\r\nour judicial institutions to ensure that the perpetrators of\r\ndrug abuse and related crimes are brought to swift and\r\neffective justice.\r\nWe in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are closely\r\nobserving the evolution of democracy in the States of\r\nEastern Europe and the territories of the former Soviet\r\nUnion, as well as its consolidation worldwide. We agonized\r\nwith freedom-loving peoples when the Russian constitutional\r\ncrisis threatened to \"put democracy under a shade.\" We\r\nregret the loss of life that resulted from the struggle for\r\ncontrol, and we hope that the emergence of a full- fledged\r\nsystem of democracy, with the ultimate power residing in the\r\nhands of the people, will not be impeded by any self-serving\r\nacts on the part of major players.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the\r\nconstitutional resolution of the political impasse in Pakistan.\r\nAs a member of the Commonwealth, we welcome Mrs.\r\nBenazir Bhutto back as Prime Minister of her country and\r\nlook forward to meeting her in Cyprus at the Commonwealth\r\nHeads of Government meeting.\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate its resolute\r\ncommitment to the democratic ideal and the concomitant\r\nfree enterprise system. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nlike the other countries of CARICOM, has gone through a\r\nhistoric constitutional journey, from Crown Colony\r\nGovernment, with its limited franchise, to full political\r\nindependence under universal adult suffrage. We have\r\nadhered to the principles and practice of participatory\r\ndemocracy and the market economy, even when these ideals\r\nwere not as pervasive and mandatory as they are today. We\r\nhave stayed the course, by choice and conviction, and our\r\npeople have reaped the benefits. They will have it no other\r\nway.\r\nIn this post-cold-war era we are determined to maintain\r\nthe gains of our democracy which we have accumulated over\r\nthe years, even as we face the increasing difficulties\r\nassociated with the marginalization of small States in the\r\nface of bloc consolidation and other emerging trends of our\r\ntime.\r\nORGANIZATION OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to draw the attention\r\nof the Assembly to document A/INF/48/6/Add.1, which\r\ncontains a tentative programme of work and schedule of\r\nplenary meetings for the months of October, November and\r\nDecember. This addendum supersedes document\r\nA/INF/48/6.\r\nI should like to point out that this schedule is being\r\nissued as early as possible in order to assist delegations in\r\nplanning their work. For its part, the Secretariat will\r\nendeavour to ensure that the relevant documentation will be\r\navailable to delegations ahead of the discussion of any given\r\nagenda item.\r\nI should further point out that there are still a few\r\nagenda items for the consideration of which no dates have\r\nbeen indicated. I will announce the dates for the\r\nconsideration of those agenda items in due course and\r\nsufficiently in advance. I will also keep the Assembly\r\ninformed of any additions or changes.\r\nThe list of speakers for each of the agenda items listed\r\nin document A/INF/48/6/Add.1 is now open, and I draw\r\nmembers’ attention to that.\r\nAs I mentioned last week, I hope to keep as closely as\r\npossible to the schedule so that the Assembly can discharge\r\nits responsibilities in an orderly fashion. I therefore appeal\r\nagain to representatives who intend to submit draft\r\nresolutions to do so sufficiently in advance of the dates fixed\r\nfor consideration of items to give members adequate time to\r\nexamine them. I should also like to remind representatives\r\nagain that additional time is needed for those draft\r\nresolutions involving changes in the work programme or\r\nadditional expenditures, since they will require the\r\npreparation of a statement of programme-budget implications\r\nby the Secretary-General.\r\nFurthermore, the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth\r\nCommittee will need adequate time to review the\r\nprogramme-budget implications of a draft resolution before\r\nit can be acted on by the Assembly. The Assembly’s\r\nattention to these matters would be appreciated.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 11\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nADDRESS BY MR. TOFILAU ETI ALESANA,\r\nPRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER FOR\r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE INDEPENDENT\r\nSTATE OF WESTERN SAMOA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Independent State of Western Samoa.\r\nMr. Tofilau Eti Alesana, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Independent State of Western\r\nSamoa, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nIndependent State of Western Samoa, His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Tofilau Eti Alesana, and inviting him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. ALESANA (Samoa): It is always an honour and\r\na great pleasure to address the General Assembly. My first\r\ntask, a happy one, is to congratulate you, Sir, most warmly\r\non your election as President of the forty-eighth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. We know that in your hands this\r\nwill be a session of accomplishments.\r\nLet me also thank your able predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, for his\r\noutstanding service during the forty-seventh session.\r\nI would next express our concern and sadness over the\r\nrecent disastrous earthquake in India and extend to the\r\nGovernment and, especially, to the families affected our\r\nprofound sympathies.\r\nTwo years ago, when I last stood here, there was a\r\nsense of high expectation, for we were witnessing the drama\r\nof political changes to a new world. Many new nation\r\nStates emerged from that process. We welcome the newest -\r\nand some of the smallest - Members of our global family\r\nwho joined us this year: the Principality of Andorra, Eritrea,\r\nthe Czech Republic, the Principality of Monaco, The Former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Slovak Republic.\r\nAs a small State itself, Samoa is particularly pleased to add\r\nits welcome, assured of the contribution these new Members\r\nwill make to our common effort.\r\nLet me also pay a tribute to the Secretary-General and\r\nexpress to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali our\r\ndeepest admiration and appreciation for the spirit of reform\r\nand quality of leadership he brings to the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWith one voice we in this Hall have hailed the ending\r\nof East-West tensions. We are right to do so. It has\r\nbrought about deep and positive changes. Now, as never\r\nbefore, the international community has real opportunities for\r\ncooperation and peace. In Washington, barely a month ago\r\ntoday, leaders of two great peoples, men of magnificent\r\ncourage and foresight, seized such an opportunity for the\r\nIsraelis and Palestinians. In our global village there is an\r\nimperative to secure a comprehensive, just and durable\r\nsolution to the overall Arab-Israeli conflict. In turn, that\r\npeace effort needs to be able to draw sustenance - moral,\r\npolitical and financial - from the whole family of nations.\r\nMost warmly we applaud the courage and vision of this bold\r\nstep. From our distance, and no matter how inadequate, I\r\npledge to the people of Israel and to the Palestinians\r\nSamoa’s entire support.\r\nBut the new opportunities for cooperation in this post-\r\ncold-war era are being severely challenged by conflicts that\r\nrage in many lands and by the human misery they cause.\r\nTragedy and carnage are seemingly endless in Bosnia, in\r\nSomalia, and in territories of the former Soviet Union. In\r\nother areas, too - far too many - we witness daily the most\r\nshocking violations of the human person and wanton\r\ndisregard for the rule of law. This year alone, there have\r\nbeen close to 25 substantial conflicts in the world.\r\nAnd war is not the only scourge. For we have not\r\nfreed our world of hunger, poverty or illness. Millions of\r\npeople have fled from internal strife and persecution, famine\r\nand natural disasters. Millions more are migrating for\r\neconomic reasons.\r\nIn my part of the world, island communities now live\r\nunder the constant threat of ecological disasters. A rise in\r\nsea levels and destructive tropical cyclones are particular\r\ndangers. The evidence we have is that these are the global\r\nand adverse effects of induced climate change. They prey\r\non the natural vulnerabilities of many lands and their\r\npeoples, and severely undermine the national livelihood and\r\neconomic development efforts of many Governments.\r\nMy purpose is not simply to catalogue misery and the\r\nnegative, but rather to point to the vastness of our task.\r\nThere is no scope for retreat - we must advance with\r\nresolve. The world cries out for responses and solutions.\r\nAnd the fact is, the world is now looking more and more to\r\nthe United Nations. We do not, for a moment, delude\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nourselves about the complexities of these conflicts or the\r\ndepth of longstanding animosities - least of all, in the\r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia. But I am compelled to\r\nsay that the horrors being perpetuated in Bosnia offend\r\ncommon decency and almost every principle for which this\r\nOrganization stands.\r\nThat is why we feel that the international community\r\nhas not been swift or decisive enough in taking action to end\r\nthe calculated brutality in Bosnia and avert the devastation\r\nof so much that is sacred in that land. We pray for the\r\nspeediest possible settlement, one that is comprehensive and\r\nhas realistic prospects for the lasting peace and economic\r\nprosperity of all concerned. There should be no reward for\r\naggression.\r\nThe grim outlook for many troubled areas of the world\r\nshould not, however, cast a shadow over the hope typified\r\nby the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord. Cambodia is a high\r\npoint in peacemaking, and we rejoice in this special\r\naccomplishment for the people of that ancient country and\r\nfor the United Nations, as we do in the announcement in this\r\nAssembly by Nelson Mandela of the imminent demise of\r\napartheid. South Africa’s move towards a multiracial and\r\ndemocratic society is the attainment of a dream we have all\r\nshared for so long. We pray for the peaceful success of the\r\nannounced general elections in April 1994.\r\nWe are indeed at a turning-point - a point at which\r\nwe should now turn to the healing process. We must put\r\nbehind us the divisiveness and acrimony which have\r\ncharacterized the debates and the decisions of past years.\r\nAlmost every speaker in this debate has focused on\r\npeace-keeping and the unprecedented demands being made\r\nof the United Nations. Our support of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations is total, as is our acceptance of\r\npreventive diplomacy as fundamental to \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\". We have no military resources or experience, and\r\nwe have been able to assist only by way of our assessed\r\ncontributions. But it is clear to us that failure to provide\r\nadequate financial and other resources undermines both the\r\npeace effort and the authority of the United Nations.\r\nIt seems to be generally acknowledged that, in the\r\nspace of some two years, the cost of United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping has quadrupled to a level currently four times larger\r\nthan the United Nations regular budget. In our humble\r\nopinion, peace-keeping at such a level cannot possibly be\r\nsustained without adequate and improved financing and\r\nfinancial management. Above all, peace-keeping objectives\r\nand mandates need to be clearly identified and managed.\r\nThere is everything to be gained by the application of the\r\nprinciples of accountability, consistency and transparency.\r\nPeace-keeping at current levels has compounded the\r\ntragedy of war through the loss of United Nations staff and\r\npersonnel. In the strongest terms, we condemn the attacks\r\nand deliberate targeting of United Nations peace-keeping\r\nforces wherever they occur. We support early and effective\r\ninternational measures and necessary arrangements within\r\nthe United Nations system for the full protection of United\r\nNations personnel and forces, as well as action against those\r\nwho commit acts of violence against our messengers of\r\npeace.\r\nIn all this, the Security Council is the vital link. We\r\nnow have a proposal before the Assembly to take a closer\r\nlook at the arrangements and strengthening of the Security\r\nCouncil. We also acknowledge the useful report the\r\nSecretary-General has sent us on the various views\r\nexpressed. Our own concern is for the efficacy and\r\neffectiveness of the Council. So long as these are assured,\r\nSamoa would support the required reforms to the Security\r\nCouncil. But, no doubt, we should all take sufficient time\r\nto ponder these matters.\r\nIn the wider aspect, we believe that no amount of force\r\nand no measure of peace-keeping can sustain peace and\r\nsecurity without attention to the root causes. The general\r\nexperience is that human misery, brought about by poverty\r\nand the denial of human and democratic rights, is the real\r\nand fundamental problem. We therefore uphold the belief\r\nexpressed by many leaders from this rostrum that socio-\r\neconomic development and democratic reforms areessential\r\nto the prevention of political and social crises. We think this\r\nshould remain a major preoccupation of the United Nations.\r\nWe believe deeply in the underlying importance of\r\nhuman rights in all United Nations activities. In this respect,\r\nwe welcome the Declaration and Programme of Action\r\nproduced by the World Conference on Human Rights in\r\nVienna and the acknowledgement in unquestionable terms of\r\nthe universality of human rights. The results of the Vienna\r\nConference constitute a significant advance in the promotion\r\nand protection of human rights, not least in the recognition\r\nthat development has a true claim to be considered a human\r\nright.\r\nWe agree with and support the proposal to establish a\r\nUnited Nations high commissioner for human rights. Such\r\nan office could serve as a strong focal point for coordination\r\nof the currently fragmented branches of the United Nations\r\nhuman rights system and could help to ensure that human\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 13\r\nrights are integrated into the work of all United Nations\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe very basis of human rights is the right of peoples\r\nto determine their own future and governance. This is\r\nfundamental, and it is something very close to our hearts,\r\ngiven our experience and the political evolvement of our\r\nown State. The South Pacific Forum has continued to call\r\non the metropolitan countries to take into account the wishes\r\nof the people in the Territories and to respect their right to\r\nself-determination.\r\nWe welcome the ongoing dialogue between France and\r\nall parties in New Caledonia regarding the future of the\r\nTerritory. The peaceful evolution towards self-determination\r\nin New Caledonia is in accordance with the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Its attainment was made possible by\r\nthe constructive intervention of the United Nations\r\ndecolonization Committee and by the willingness of the\r\nGovernment of France, the parties in New Caledonia and the\r\nSouth Pacific Forum to show restraint to give full\r\nconsideration to each other’s concerns and sensitivities.\r\nWhat we see in New Caledonia today stands as a testament\r\nto the cooperative spirit characteristic of the Pacific region\r\nand as a true example of peaceful and preventive diplomacy\r\nat work.\r\nAt the same time, we acknowledge and respect the\r\nviews and interests of those Territories that wish to continue\r\nwith the status quo.\r\nPeace, stability, security and the preservation of our\r\nenvironment are crucial to the South Pacific region. Our\r\ncommitment to these objectives is unwavering, and Samoa,\r\ntogether with its regional partners, will continue to call for\r\na permanent end to nuclear testing, to the dumping of\r\nchemical and toxic wastes and to the transportation of these\r\nmaterials in our waters. The South Pacific Forum countries\r\nhave continued to urge the remaining nuclear-power States\r\nto heed our concerns and to accede to the Protocols of the\r\nSouth Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. That Treaty is the\r\nparamount symbol of the region’s strong feeling about and\r\ncommitment to a nuclear-free environment. We are\r\nencouraged by recent indications from some of these States\r\nthat they will reconsider their current positions on the Treaty\r\nand on other nuclear-related issues that are of concern to the\r\nregion.\r\nSamoa is particularly pleased about the extension of the\r\nnuclear-testing moratorium. However, we are deeply\r\ndistressed to have learned last week of a breach of that\r\nmoratorium. I have cause to believe that substantial\r\nnumbers in the Assembly share our concern and our earnest\r\nprayer that no further tests will be carried out and that other\r\nnuclear Powers will not resume their nuclear-testing\r\nprogrammes. It is our dearest hope that such testing will\r\none day cease - permanently. We also urge all Member States -\r\nthe nuclear Powers in particular - to work towards the early\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty.\r\nWe welcome the unique opportunity offered by the end\r\nof the cold war to focus and develop comprehensive-nuclear-\r\ndisarmament initiatives. We stand ready to do what we can\r\nin support of these. We should say, however, that the\r\nprospect of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and - worse -\r\nof their acquisition by unfriendly parties is of major concern\r\nto us, as, of course, to the world community as a whole. It\r\nunderscores the urgent need for the control, reduction and\r\neventual elimination of these deadly weapons. The\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty, which is a vital part of the\r\ndisarmament process must be extended indefinitely when it\r\ncomes up for review in 1995.\r\nWe look to the nuclear-weapon States to take the lead\r\nin the nuclear-disarmament process and, at the same time, to\r\nillustrate with concrete action their full commitment to our\r\ncollective goals and objectives. The South Pacific region\r\ncannot continue to be a testing ground for nuclear devices;\r\nor to be a dumping ground for chemical wastes; or to be\r\nexposed to contamination by toxic wastes and other\r\nenvironmentally threatening substances.\r\nEnvironmental security is crucial to Samoa and other\r\ncountries of the South Pacific. The United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, held in Rio\r\nin 1992, provided us with an opportunity to put our global\r\nhouse in order - an occasion of promise, of rising hopes.\r\nThe setting of Agenda 21 and the establishment of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development are only first steps.\r\nImplementation is the difficult task - the true test.\r\nLike other places, our small island States and low-lying\r\natolls face a host of constraints. Isolated and ecologically\r\nfragile, small island States like my own are amongst the\r\nmost vulnerable to external economic, trade and climatic\r\nfactors. Without international cooperation, and without an\r\nintegrated approach, the outlook is not promising.\r\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable Development\r\nof Small Island Developing States - to be held in Barbados\r\nin April 1994 - will provide a first opportunity to implement\r\nAgenda 21 and to reaffirm commitments made in Rio. We\r\nfirmly believe that international attention, focused at next\r\nyear’s global conference, will provide valuable guidance\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ntowards a sustainable-development effort worldwide. It\r\nseems to us that if there is failure to secure sustainable\r\ndevelopment for small island States, there will be no real\r\nchance of success elsewhere.\r\nThe work of the Preparatory Committee remains\r\nincomplete. But the stakes are too high for\r\ninconclusiveness, so a resumed preparatory session before\r\nthe Barbados Conference is essential.\r\nI should say that our call for international cooperation\r\nis fully matched by our resolve to do what is necessary and\r\npossible at the domestic level. As a country, we\r\nacknowledge and accept primary responsibility for our\r\nenvironment and development. To this end, we have\r\ncompleted a national environment-management plan, have\r\nput in place the necessary legislative framework and have\r\ntaken steps to adhere to the appropriate international\r\nConventions.\r\nIn all of this, we have had the fullest cooperation of the\r\nSouth Pacific Regional Environmental Programme - an\r\norganization established by the Pacific region and partner\r\ncountries to coordinate not only national and regional\r\nactivities but also the region’s participation in world-wide\r\ninitiatives on the environment. This underlines our basic\r\nbelief that the total efforts of all nations, acting responsibly\r\nand in concert, will be crucial if we are adequately to protect\r\nour environment and our planet.\r\nI should note the general satisfaction of my delegation\r\nwith the world-wide debate, which is now under way, about\r\nthe future of development - and, thus, about our common\r\nfuture. The United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment was a special landmark. A few months ago,\r\ncontrary to predictions, the Vienna World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights registered important accomplishments. Next\r\nyear, we shall see the particularly crucial Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development; thereafter, the Conference on\r\nwomen, and then the social-development Summit.\r\nYesterday, we heard Papua New Guinea’s initiative on\r\nopportunity and participation. We consider this a pertinent\r\nproposal, and that it is an important element in the overall\r\neffort to involve citizens and to enhance, in particular, the\r\neconomies of developing countries.\r\nThese global conferences and initiatives will map out\r\nnew priorities and courses of action requiring from States\r\nand ordinary citizens the highest degree of commitment and\r\ncooperation. Meantime, we will need to concentrate on\r\nstrengthening and revitalizing our Organization if we are to\r\nrespond efficiently and effectively to present and future\r\npriorities. To this purpose, Samoa supports all remedial\r\nreforms to the United Nations system to ensure optimum use\r\nof scarce resources.\r\nNext year has been declared, by the Assembly, the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. In two years’ time, the\r\nUnited Nations will mark its fiftieth anniversary. This gives\r\nus all reason to move ahead with our work, resolved to\r\nimprove the condition of our world and the well-being of\r\nour global family.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Independent State of Western\r\nSamoa for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Tofilau Eti Alesana, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Independent State of Western\r\nSamoa, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nMr. ALEXIS (Grenada): It is with profound pleasure\r\nthat my delegation conveys greetings and best wishes from\r\nthe Government and the people of Grenada to the United\r\nNations General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to extend sincere\r\ncongratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly during this forty-eighth\r\nsession. We are especially pleased because you create\r\nhistory by being the first person from the region to which\r\nGrenada belongs to hold the prestigious post of General\r\nAssembly Presidency, coming as you do from our sister\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) country, the Republic\r\nof Guyana.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity also to commend\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria for the excellent manner in\r\nwhich he conducted the Assembly’s proceedings at its forty-\r\nseventh session. My Government also wishes to extend its\r\nc o m m e n d a t i o n s t o t h e S e c r e t a r y - G e n e r a l ,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his indefatigable efforts in\r\nthe service of the Organization.\r\nThe Grenadian delegation is pleased to extend a warm\r\nwelcome to the six new Members of the United Nations:\r\nthe Czech Republic; the Republic of Slovakia, Eritrea,\r\nMonaco, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and\r\nAndorra.\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 15\r\nThe problems of developing countries are still daunting.\r\nEvery country must try to help itself. My Government\r\ncontinues to pursue its own economic structural adjustment\r\nprogramme, with which the people of Grenada have shown\r\ngreat understanding and cooperation. But prolonged\r\ndifficulties in the economic sector can give rise to attitudes\r\nand conditions that can adversely impact upon social\r\ndevelopment and administrative capacities, and so my\r\ndelegation calls on the international community to show\r\ngreater flexibility in assisting the adjustment process of\r\nGrenada and other countries experiencing economic\r\nconditions similar to Grenada’s.\r\nPoverty, debt, inadequate resources, marginalization and\r\nthe lack of secure markets for our products deal serious\r\nblows to social, economic and political stability. Further, the\r\nimpact on small, undiversified economies from liberalizing\r\ntrade regimes and regional trading blocs has been shocking.\r\nThe fact is that free trade is not always synonymous with\r\nfair trade: factors of size, resource endowment and levels of\r\ndevelopment must be duly considered in settling trade\r\nrelations. This is particularly so with small, open, primary-\r\nproducing economies, where one serious natural disaster,\r\nsuch as a hurricane, can devastate all the fruits of our\r\nnational labour invested in bananas, cocoa and nutmeg.\r\nIn this scenario, concessioned trade is very much\r\nneeded to produce anything like a level playing field.\r\nDeveloping countries will not progress on sympathy; they\r\nrequire equity. Small countries such as Grenada cannot do\r\nit all alone. We need assistance for diversification, for\r\ndevelopment of our human resources and for the\r\nimplementation of sustainable development.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment (UNCED) has placed before the world a wide\r\nrange of challenges for managing the environment in a\r\nsustainable way. Developing countries, in particular small\r\nisland nation States, like Grenada, are anxious that all\r\nGovernments should move faster to effect the programme\r\nlaid out by UNCED’s plan of work on sustainable\r\ndevelopment, Agenda 21.\r\nGreater emphasis needs to be placed by donor agencies\r\non training, as well as on technical and financial assistance\r\nto developing countries to aid in sustainable forestry and\r\nagricultural practices. My delegation is convinced that the\r\nproblems of the environment cannot wait. Grenada is\r\nparticularly pleased with Agenda 21’s special recognition of\r\nthe peculiar difficulties confronting the development of small\r\nisland developing States and with the Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates (SIDS), arising from that recognition, that will be held\r\nin Barbados in April and May 1994.\r\nIt is Grenada’s sincere hope that that Conference will\r\nserve to generate a better understanding of the challenges\r\nand predicaments confronting small island developing States,\r\nand that it will produce the necessary partnership and\r\nestablish a sound path to their sustainable development.\r\nMuch of the important negotiations preparatory to the\r\nConference remains incomplete. My delegation is concerned\r\nthat the success of the Barbados Conference may be\r\njeopardized unless an intercessional mechanism is arranged\r\nto provide for the advancement of the negotiations prior to\r\nApril 1994.\r\nGrenada joins the rest of the world in rejoicing over the\r\nsuccess of diplomatic perseverance in Afghanistan, El\r\nSalvador, Nicaragua, Cambodia and Haiti. Grenada is,\r\nhowever, highly disturbed by the renewal of politically\r\nmotivated violence in Haiti. Grenada will continue to rally\r\nbehind the United Nations and the Organization of American\r\nStates in their efforts to restore democracy and stability to\r\nHaiti. Grenada welcomes the Governors Island negotiated\r\nsettlement aimed at restoring to Haiti the legitimate\r\nGovernment of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. We\r\nsupport the establishment of an international constabulary\r\nforce in that country. We call on all in Haitian society to\r\ngive democracy and peace a chance.\r\nGrenada wishes to record its satisfaction over the\r\nhistoric attainment of formal recognition between Israel and\r\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). We further\r\napplaud the signing of the Palestinian autonomy agreement\r\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. It\r\nis a long-awaited peace initiative which will pave the way\r\nfor the continued peaceful negotiation of tougher issues.\r\nSuch a step will, in the long term, contribute to making the\r\nMiddle East and the world a more peaceful place.\r\nGrenada welcomes the peace agreements initialled\r\nbetween Israel and Morocco and between Israel and Jordan\r\nas steps in the right direction.\r\nGrenada welcomes the finalization of the demarcation\r\nof the boundary between Kuwait and Iraq, which was\r\naccomplished by the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation\r\nCommission on 20 May 1993. We also welcome the\r\nadoption by the Security Council of its\r\nresolution 833 (1993), in which it guaranteed the\r\ninviolability of the boundary between the two States and\r\ncalled for respect for that resolution.\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMy Government is, on the other hand, perturbed by the\r\ncontinuing wars in other parts of the world, such as the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, Liberia, Somalia and Angola. We are\r\nalarmed at the lack of respect for United Nations peace--\r\nkeepers and aid workers, and call upon all sides in such\r\nconflicts to turn to peaceful negotiation and respect for\r\nhuman lives.\r\nThe promotion of democracy and the enhancement of\r\nhuman rights must be vigorously pursued. The process of\r\ndemocratization has to be entrenched. My delegation,\r\nmoreover, looks forward to welcoming to the United\r\nNations, in the near future, the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan. With its 21 million people, the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan, has, over the past 20 years, progressed\r\neconomically, socially and democratically to the point where\r\nit can no longer properly be kept out of the United Nations.\r\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan has established diplomatic\r\nrelations with a number of countries and has significantly\r\ncontributed to the uplifting of the struggling economies of a\r\ngreat number of countries and the development of their\r\npeoples. Surely, these impressive achievements eminently\r\nqualify the Republic of China on Taiwan for admission to\r\nthis Organization.\r\nPeace and democracy reaching areas new to them has\r\nnoticeably been resulting in the deflection of aid to them, at\r\nthe expense of traditional stable democracies. That newly\r\nemerging democracies have to be given due attention cannot\r\nbe denied, but this cannot be wholly at the expense of the\r\nold democracies. The peace dividend accruing from the end\r\nof the cold war and the halting of the arms race should be\r\nexpansive enough to nurture new democracies without\r\nabandoning old ones to unnecessary and far-reaching social\r\nand societal conflicts. After all, the issue of development is\r\nno less important than the issue of peace.\r\nInternational peace presupposes domestic quietude in\r\nthe States making up the community of nations. This\r\nrequires continuing emphasis on human-resource\r\ndevelopment and the enhancement of cultural and social\r\namenities in such areas as education, health and housing. In\r\nthis regard, Grenada insists on the protection of the rights of\r\nthe child, enhancement of the rights of women and the\r\nstrengthening of the family unit. The pursuit of the human\r\nrace must be the nurturing of peace by the ending of\r\ndiscrimination and the enhancement of equality, whether\r\nbetween sexes or races, or with regard to social origins,\r\nreligion or whatever other differences might have been\r\ncreated through ignorance or arrogance. As we in Grenada\r\nsay \"A child is a child\".\r\nMy delegation welcomes the establishment of a\r\ncriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. It is with great\r\nconcern that the world has witnessed men, women and\r\nchildren being massacred in that region in the name of\r\nethnicity and religion. Grenada takes this opportunity to\r\nencourage the establishment of similar tribunals in areas\r\nwhere they may be necessary.\r\nSuch cooperation as the world is seeing today in\r\nrestoring democracy and civil and political rights to citizens\r\nof warring countries ought to be extended to the field of\r\ninternational criminal activities. Grenada stands ready to\r\ncollaborate with other countries in putting a halt to such\r\nactivities as illicit drug production, trafficking and\r\nconsumption and money-laundering and their associated ills.\r\nThese tend to decay the moral fibre of a society and drain\r\nalready scant resources in efforts to combat the menace, thus\r\nfrustrating national development processes. Grenada has\r\naccordingly enacted legislation giving effect to the United\r\nNations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs\r\nand Psychotropic Substances, of 1988, providing for the\r\nforfeiture and confiscation of the proceeds of crime,\r\noutlawing moneylaundering and promoting bilateral and\r\nmultilateral cooperation in the fight against these menaces.\r\nGrenada is very pleased that the South African\r\nParliament has agreed to establish a Transitional Executive\r\nCouncil, which is expected to allow the black majority to\r\nparticipate in the governing of their country. We received\r\nwith joy the news that 27 April 1994 has been set as the\r\ndate for the election of a Government in South Africa in\r\nwhich South Africans of all races, colours, beliefs and\r\ngenders will participate. We applaud the efforts that have\r\nbeen made by the Government of President De Klerk and\r\nthe African National Congress of Nelson Mandela to usher\r\nin genuine democracy in South Africa. We encourage all\r\nSouth Africans to give full support to that progress.\r\nThroughout the world, people are looking towards the\r\nUnited Nations for solutions to their political, economic,\r\nethnic and social problems. The freeing of the United\r\nNations from ideological tensions has made this possible; but\r\nwe are aware that the United Nations must now be\r\nrestructured, the better to meet these ends. The composition\r\nof the Security Council should be re-examined, with new\r\npermanent seats on that Council being allotted to such\r\ncountries as Japan, without current permanent membership\r\nbeing affected. Also, additional seats should be added.\r\nFurther, an appropriate mechanism is needed to establish\r\nadequate oversight and accountability in the United Nations.\r\nThe capability of the United Nations to conduct\r\npeace-keeping should be enhanced and rationalized.\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 17\r\nWorld security requires all of us, nations great as well\r\nas small, to make extra efforts to attain and maintain peace\r\nand democracy for development. As a community of\r\nnations, let us therefore work diligently and tirelessly to\r\nattain these goals.\r\nMr. MBEKEANI (Malawi): The Malawi delegation is\r\npleased to join other delegations in congratulating you, Mr.\r\nPresident, on your election to preside over the business of\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Guyana is\r\na sister country which is held in high regard and admiration\r\nby Malawi. You are an illustrious son of Guyana and are\r\nhighly qualified and fully prepared to lead and manage the\r\nenormous tasks which must be accomplished at this session\r\nof the General Assembly. My delegation wishes your\r\npresidency great success.\r\nAt its forty-seventh session the General Assembly\r\nconsidered important and, in some cases, intractable issues.\r\nThis would not have been possible were it not for the\r\npainstaking patience, efficiency and diplomatic skills of its\r\nPresident, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, a distinguished international\r\njurist and former Foreign Minister of Bulgaria. The Malawi\r\ndelegation congratulates him on a job well done.\r\nMy delegation wishes to express its profound sorrow\r\nfor the considerable suffering, loss of life and destruction of\r\nproperty caused by the earthquake which occurred on 29\r\nSeptember 1993 in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The\r\nheartfelt and sincere condolences of the Government and the\r\npeople of Malawi unreservedly go to the Government and\r\nthe people of India as they struggle to alleviate the painful\r\nafter-effects of this tragedy.\r\nWe are thankful to God for giving Malawi good rains\r\nin the season just ended. The drought experienced in the\r\nlast two seasons was severe and devastating in its effects.\r\nAll of southern Africa suffered terribly from this scourge.\r\nMalawi’s economy was seriously affected by the drought,\r\nbeginning in February 1992. In 1991 economic growth was\r\n7.8 per cent in real gross domestic product. It declined in\r\nreal terms by 7.9 per cent during 1992, which represented a\r\nprecipitous fall in real income for the people. The volume\r\nof maize, our staple food, was only 600,000 tonnes in 1992,\r\ndown from the 1991 production level of 1.6 million tonnes.\r\nIn 1993 Malawi had a good harvest of close to 2 million\r\ntonnes of maize. However, complete recovery from the\r\ndrought will take some time.\r\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity, on\r\nbehalf of my Government and the people of Malawi, to\r\nthank the United Nations system and, in particular, the\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs, which were the major\r\ncatalysts in the United Nations -southern African\r\nDevelopment Community drought relief programme. We\r\nalso thank the bilateral donors and the non-governmental\r\norganizations which, together, saved the day for Malawi and\r\nthe whole southern African region with massive imports of\r\nfood, medicines and other humanitarian assistance supplies.\r\nHowever, the Malawi economy continues to be confronted\r\nby a major balance-of-payments deficit problem arising from\r\nthe large volume of maize imports during the drought.\r\nMalawi has been hosting a large number of refugees\r\nfrom Mozambique, who started entering Malawi in large\r\nnumbers in 1986, and by 1992 the refugee population in the\r\ncountry had soared to about 1.5 million people. The Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\r\nWorld Food Programme, non-governmental organizations\r\nand many other interested parties that have throughout been\r\nintimately involved in this humanitarian task will agree that,\r\ndespite the severe adverse impact of hosting such a large\r\nnumber of people, Malawi is managing one of the most\r\nsuccessful refugee programmes in the world, thanks to the\r\nprevailing peace, which is due to stable political leadership,\r\ngood and reliable security structures and a fairly efficient\r\nadministration.\r\nMr. Martini Herrera (Guatemala), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe problem of the Mozambican refugees in Malawi,\r\nwhich was a consequence of the civil war between the\r\nGovernment of Mozambique and RENAMO, will come to an\r\nend as all protocols of the Rome General Peace Accord are\r\nimplemented in full. Malawi, which was represented at the\r\nhistoric signing of the Peace Accord on 4 October 1992,\r\ncommends President Chissano of the Republic of\r\nMozambique and Mr. Dhlakama, President of RENAMO, for\r\nsigning the Peace Accord. We strongly encourage them to\r\ncontinue to work closely together and with the United\r\nNations to ensure that peace and political stability are firmly\r\nestablished in Mozambique. This is a prerequisite for the\r\nreconstruction of that great and beautiful country to\r\ncommence and for progress to be realized in all areas of\r\ndevelopment. My delegation is therefore fully supportive of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 863 (1993) and calls on all the\r\nparties to implement it speedily.\r\nThe Government and people of Malawi wish to see the\r\nuninterrupted repatriation of their brothers and sisters to their\r\nhomes in Mozambique in safety and security. We therefore\r\ncall for the specific prioritization of the de-mining\r\nprogramme, the demobilization of the armed forces and their\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nplacement in the designated assembly areas, and the\r\nfinalization of discussions on the draft electoral law. The\r\npeople of Mozambique demand this, and it is also in the\r\nvital interests of Malawi, which has suffered tremendously\r\nfrom the adverse impact of the 16-year civil war in\r\nMozambique.\r\nMy delegation wishes to stress that the cost of hosting\r\nover 1 million refugees not only is very high but, for\r\nMalawi, has reached a crisis point. This cost is paid in the\r\ndisplacement of Malawians from agricultural land; in\r\nover-grazing, deforestation and environmental degradation;\r\nin tremendous pressures and strain on the Government\r\nadministrative infrastructure, budgetary and human resources;\r\nand, not least, in the strain on the socio-economic\r\ninfrastructure such as schools, hospitals, roads, bridges and\r\nwater supplies. My delegation is taking this opportunity to\r\nappeal to the donor community for assistance in all these\r\nareas, which are crucial for the country’s sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe General Peace Accord in Mozambique is close to\r\nthe heart of Malawi. I therefore wish to reiterate that\r\nMalawi will continue to collaborate with Mozambique\r\nclosely - at the bilateral level, between the Governments of\r\nthe two sister countries; through the Tripartite Commission,\r\nwhose members are Malawi, the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and\r\nMozambique; and through the Malawi-Mozambique Security\r\nCommission - until the peace process has been consolidated.\r\nPeace and the return of normal life in Mozambique will\r\nguarantee Malawi the use of its traditional, and shortest,\r\nroutes to the sea via the ports of Nacala and Beira. The\r\nreopening and full use of these ports will represent\r\nconsiderable savings through highly reduced transport costs\r\nand in limited foreign exchange resources.\r\nMy country undertook the most historic event since\r\nindependence by holding, on 14 June 1993, the national\r\nreferendum which was initiated by our President, His\r\nExcellency Ngwazi Kamuzu Banda in order to give the\r\npeople of Malawi the opportunity to choose between a\r\none-party and multi-party system of government. My\r\ndelegation is pleased to report to this Assembly that by all\r\naccounts, including those of the United Nations, it was a\r\npeaceful, free and fair exercise. Sixty-three per cent of the\r\npopulation voted for a multi-party system of government.\r\nTheir decision was respected and accepted by my President\r\nin a landmark statement on 17 June 1993, which included an\r\nannouncement of his intention to amend the Constitution to\r\nallow for the formation of political parties, to call for a\r\ngeneral election in a year’s time and to declare a general\r\namnesty to enable political exiles to return home and\r\nparticipate in the political process.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to convey to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the gratitude\r\nof my Government and the people of Malawi for the\r\nassistance the United Nations system provided in making the\r\nnational referendum exercise a resounding success.\r\nIntergovernmental organizations such as the European\r\nCommunity and other bilateral donors also provided Malawi\r\nwith invaluable assistance during this period. My\r\nGovernment is most grateful to all of them. What has\r\nhappened in Malawi demonstrates beyond question the\r\nrepeatedly stated commitment of my President and his\r\nGovernment to peaceful reforms, good governance, human\r\nrights and democratization. Those who did not believe in\r\nthe seriousness of this commitment have been proved totally\r\nwrong.\r\nFor the last 29 years of its independence, Malawi has\r\nbeen preoccupied with socio-economic development, which\r\nis rural-based in its reality, as a matter of sustained and\r\ndeliberate Government policy. The country had no other\r\nchoice because it is completely agricultural, with a large\r\nsmall-holder agriculture component as its backbone. The\r\npolitical leadership consistently and untiringly preached the\r\ndoctrine of respect for the land and farming to the ordinary\r\npeople in the villages throughout the country. This has paid\r\noff in the disciplined commitment the Malawi people have\r\nto farming. As a consequence, over the years a large\r\nproportion of donor financing has focused on the agricultural\r\nsector.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to thank, on behalf\r\nof my Government, all the multilateral donors - the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the African Development Bank,\r\namong others - and the bilateral cooperating partners for the\r\nunremitting assistance they have given Malawi, enabling it\r\nto implement successfully its agricultural programmes and\r\nprojects over these past years. Without this assistance, it\r\nwould not have been possible to achieve the sense of\r\ndiscipline and respect for farming that is now consolidated\r\nin the people of Malawi, which confirms a vision that the\r\nMalawi leadership has carried out with practical zeal and\r\ntenacity.\r\nRegrettably, in the very recent past, Malawi’s modest\r\nachievements in the agricultural sector and the economy in\r\ngeneral have had to go through severe and unpalatable\r\nshocks well beyond the Government’s control, such as the\r\ndrought and refugee problems. But, more than that, the\r\neconomy has had to cope in the past year with the sudden\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 19\r\nsuspension of donor assistance by the Government’s\r\ndeveloped partners. Consequently, the country’s balance-of-\r\npayments financing requirements were badly affected and\r\nthis disproportionately imposed considerable negative results\r\non the economy’s performance. For example, private-sector\r\nfirms performed far below capacity and the financing of\r\nalmost all agreed development projects stopped suddenly and\r\ncompletely. Malawi is small, poor and landlocked. It is\r\nalso in the category of least developed countries, with a\r\npopulation of only about 9 million. Malawi could therefore\r\nhardly sustain or cushion this kind of massive damage to its\r\neconomy. Its external debt burden soared, its terms of trade\r\ndeteriorated badly and the livelihood of the ordinary men,\r\nwomen and children in the villages was badly affected.\r\nThe issues of human rights, good governance and other\r\nconditionalities that were behind these actions by the donor\r\ncommunity have now, I am happy to say, been dealt with\r\ndecisively, each one in an irreversible manner and, where\r\napplicable, by Act of Parliament. For example, due process\r\nof law is firmly established and in practice in Malawi.\r\nThere are no political detainees in any of its prisons. The\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross is workinq closely\r\nwith the Government, and has already visited all prisons and\r\nmade recommendations for improvements where this has\r\nbeen found to be necessary. There is freedom of expression\r\nin the country. As I speak, over 20 newspapers and\r\nmagazines are in circulation. So far, six political parties\r\nhave registered and are bracing themselves for the\r\nforthcoming general election.\r\nAt present the Malawi Congress Party, which is\r\ncontinuing to rule the country until the people elect a new\r\ngovernment, has, together with other political parties in the\r\ncountry, established the National Consultative Council and\r\nthe National Executive Committee, which have clearly\r\ndefined powers to oversee the transitional process in the run-\r\nup to the general election. Each of the political parties,\r\nincluding the Malawi Congress Party, has equal\r\nrepresentation on the National Consultative Council and the\r\nNational Executive Committee. Those institutions ensure\r\nand guarantee that there is dialogue between and among\r\nMalawians, who discuss and resolve whatever differences\r\nmay exist on the issues affecting the transition. Those\r\ninstitutions replace the President’s Committee on Dialogue\r\nand the Public Affairs Committee, which were established\r\nimmediately after the referendum and, in addition, are\r\ndesigned to work closely with the Government and the\r\nNational Parliament. The United Nations, particularly\r\nthrough its Electoral Assistance Unit in the Secretariat here\r\nin New York and through the Centre for Human Rights in\r\nGeneva, has been a catalyst in this whole transitional\r\nprocess. My Government is therefore most encouraged,\r\nbeing convinced that the peace and stability that have existed\r\nsince the holding of the national referendum will continue\r\nuntil and after the forthcoming general election, which is\r\nexpected to take place some time in May 1994.\r\nThese positive and irreversible developments I have\r\ndescribed give my Government the confidence that all its\r\nbilateral- development partners and its major multilateral\r\ndonors will fully resume development assistance flows and\r\nbalance-of-payments support to Malawi. This, we hope, will\r\nbe done without further delays, in the interests of reviving\r\nthe economy quickly and reducing the severe damage it has\r\nsustained and the unnecessary continued suffering of its\r\npeople.\r\nThe Malawi delegation is grateful to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), in particular, because it\r\nwas the first to confirm, in a report to its Governing Council\r\nat its fortieth session, in June, that there existed in Malawi\r\nan enabling political, economic and social environment to\r\nimplement its Fifth Country Programme. The Malawi\r\nGovernment has no need to prove its abiding commitment to\r\ndevelopment. Allow me, therefore, to take this opportunity\r\nto appeal to the donor community not to reduce its pledges\r\nof funding to the UNDP. To do so would have catastrophic\r\neffects on the whole democratization process, on the ongoing\r\nfield programmes and projects and also on the successful\r\nprojects being implemented under the Fifth Country\r\nProgramme.\r\nAt this juncture the Malawi delegation wishes to\r\nreaffirm its unwavering support of the recently adopted\r\nTokyo Declaration on African Development, which\r\nrepresents the first concrete action and commitment of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s. Malawi, a least-developed country, would also\r\nlike to take this opportunity to lend its unwavering support\r\nto the Programme of Action for Least-Developed Countries,\r\nwhich found its expression in the Declaration issued by the\r\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs of least-developed countries\r\nwhen they met here in New York on 30 September 1993,\r\nand to the Declaration of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Group of 77 that was adopted on 5 October 1993. We\r\nhope that the donor community will respond positively and\r\nact accordingly on these specific problems affecting the\r\ndeveloping countries. Their decisive resolutions are pivotal\r\nto the role of the United Nations in development and integral\r\nto the call issued in General Assembly resolution 47/181 for\r\nthe Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive report on\r\nan agenda for development and for the Assembly to discuss\r\nit in its preliminary form at this current session.\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMalawi is not oblivious of the wider political\r\natmosphere that is affecting international relations and\r\ncausing serious problems with regard to peace and security.\r\nThe desperate situation and horrendous scenes of the civil\r\nwar in Bosnia and Herzegovina represent one such example.\r\nIt is the strong conviction of the Malawi Government that\r\npeace is the only answer to the unending violence we are\r\nwitnessing in the Balkans. There is an extremely urgent\r\nneed to end the suffering of the people there - innocent men,\r\nwomen and children. My delegation strongly supports all\r\nefforts of the United Nations and the European Community,\r\nand those of other parties, to resolve the problem through the\r\nongoing negotiations in Geneva and elsewhere. The problem\r\nis a human catastrophe, notwithstanding its tragic, historical\r\nroots.\r\nWith regard to Somalia, my Government is of the view\r\nthat the Somalis should resolve their problems themselves.\r\nHowever, the prerequisite for realizing that objective is to\r\nestablish and consolidate peace throughout Somalia and to\r\nhelp create processes that will make it possible for the\r\ncountry to reaffirm its sovereignty. Tremendous\r\nhumanitarian-assistance achievements have already been\r\nmade to alleviate the plight of the Somali people, who are\r\nsuffering from hunger, starvation and death in the midst of\r\nmayhem, anarchy and the complete collapse of civil\r\nauthority. The United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity, through the contributions of selfless non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and all nations - particularly the\r\nUnited States, which has contributed troops under the United\r\nNations flag - deserve to be thanked for bringing Somalia\r\nback to life. In the view of my delegation, it is imperative\r\nthat the United Nations and the international community be\r\nallowed to complete this wholesome task by establishing\r\nconditions for peace and civil authority based clearly on the\r\nAddis Ababa agreements of 27 March 1993. The Malawi\r\ndelegation fully supports the present United Nations role in\r\nSomalia.\r\nSimilarly, it is the strong conviction of my Government\r\nthat the present situation in Angola calls for strong and\r\ndramatic action by the international community. The United\r\nNations has been selfless in what it has done in Angola,\r\nwhere the untold suffering of women, children and the\r\nelderly goes on unabated and is indeed completely\r\ninexplicable and totally unnecessary. The Malawi delegation\r\ncalls upon the Organization of African Unity, the United\r\nNations and the signatory Powers to the Bicesse Peace\r\nAccords to compel the UNITA leadership to come to the\r\nnegotiating table with the Angola Government to establish\r\npeace, security and stability in the country. My Government\r\nfully supports Security Council resolution 864 (1993), which\r\nhas now been put into effect. Dr. Savimbi and the UNITA\r\nleadership must not ignore international concerns and the\r\ncontent of that resolution. They must honour and respect the\r\nresults of the United Nations-supervised general election,\r\nwhich by all accounts was free and fair.\r\nWith regard to the situation in South Africa, the Malawi\r\ndelegation wishes to put on record its complete support for\r\nthe historic agreement by the Multi-Party Negotiating\r\nCouncil in Johannesburg, whose successfully negotiated\r\ntransitional institutions have now been enacted into law by\r\nthe parliament in Cape Town. Those institutions are\r\ndesigned to oversee and control the influential factors in the\r\nrun-up to the general election on 27 April 1994. I refer in\r\nparticular to the Transitional Executive Council and to the\r\nIndependent Broadcasting Authority, the Independent Media\r\nCommission and the Independent Electoral Commission.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity, on behalf of the\r\nMalawi Government, to congratulate all the parties on the\r\nNegotiating Council and, in particular, the African National\r\nCongress and Mr. Nelson Mandela, its President, and the\r\nPresident of South Africa, Mr. Frederick de Klerk and his\r\nNational Party. It has been a very long haul to reach this\r\nhistoric stage, and the imperative is therefore clear, namely,\r\nthat all possible assistance by the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the European Community,\r\nthe Commonwealth Secretariat and friendly Governments\r\nand people of good will must now be intensified in order to\r\nremove all forms of violence, ensure that the general election\r\ntakes place on 27 April 1994 and that a non-racial,\r\ndemocratic government is installed in South Africa, based on\r\nthe will of the majority of its people.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the historic agreement on\r\nmutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) which was signed on 13\r\nSeptember 1993 in Washington, D.C. It provides a\r\nframework for lasting peace in the Middle East, and in the\r\nview of the Malawi delegation, it deserves all the support it\r\ncan receive from all well-disposed sources. History dictates\r\nthat this should be so. This agreement is a prerequisite to\r\ninternational peace, security and political stability beyond the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nThe PLO/Israel peace agreement is yet another\r\ndemonstration of the dramatic changes in international\r\nrelations that have taken place in the last three to four years,\r\nfollowing the collapse of communism and the end of the\r\ncold war. It is in this context, that my Government is\r\noptimistic that the still unresolved major international\r\npolitical issues will be similarly dealt with, issues such as\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 21\r\nthe problem of North and South Korea and that of the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China and the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan. In the view of the Malawi delegation, the time has\r\nnow come for serious consideration to be given to the\r\neligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to become a\r\nMember of the United Nations. We cannot talk about\r\nhuman rights and the universality of the United Nations\r\nwhile in the same breath ignoring the existence of over 20\r\nmillion people in the Republic of China on Taiwan.\r\nFinally, allow me to make observations on two\r\npertinent issues. First, my delegation welcomes the recent\r\npronouncement by the United States delegation on\r\nsupporting the membership of Japan and Germany in the\r\nSecurity Council. This announcement is definite recognition\r\nthat the time has come for representation in the Security\r\nCouncil to reflect the changed international political scene\r\nand reality as well as geographical balance. The Security\r\nCouncil must not only be transparent in its decision-making;\r\nit is a political necessity that it also reflect what the world\r\nis today, and not what it was 48 years ago. There is no\r\nother organ in the United Nations today which makes such\r\nmomentous decisions affecting international peace and\r\nsecurity. My delegation is therefore strongly of the view\r\nthat Africa equally deserves to have a permanent seat or\r\nequal and balanced representation of some kind, in the\r\nCouncil. The Malawi delegation looks forward to the\r\nexpected deliberations on this issue, which will inevitably go\r\nbeyond the life of the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nRepresentation on governing councils of the respective\r\nUnited Nations agencies and bodies is another important\r\nsubject before the General Assembly at this session, in the\r\ncontext of the reform, restructuring and revitalization of the\r\nUnited Nations in all its aspects. My delegation supports a\r\nnegotiated approach to the points of disagreement between\r\nthe developing countries and their partners in development\r\nas a whole. The only way forward is for the two groups to\r\nwork together and arrive at a consensus by the end of\r\nNovember 1994. My delegation will support the view taken\r\nby the Group of 77 on this issue, when it comes to a\r\nconclusion in due course.\r\nI wish you, Sir, and the Assembly fruitful deliberations.\r\nMr. ALIYEV (Azerbaijan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Allow me first to congratulate Mr. Samuel\r\nInsanally on his election to his responsible post, and to wish\r\nhim every success in his work.\r\nAllow me also to express gratitude to the President of\r\nour last session, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for his able guidance of\r\nour work, and to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for his dynamic, tireless work to restructure the\r\nOrganization and enhance its effectiveness, given the\r\nqualitative changes occurring in the system of international\r\nrelations.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the\r\nnew members of the United Nations: the Czech Republic,\r\nthe Slovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Eritrea, Monaco and Andorra.\r\nThe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly is\r\ntaking place at a momentous time. The twentieth century,\r\nwhich has experienced two of the most destructive wars in\r\nthe history of mankind, as well as the cold war and the arms\r\nrace, which have depleted natural and financial resources,\r\nthe intellectual and moral potential of civilization, is\r\nnevertheless ending on an optimistic note. Totalitarian\r\nregimes have fallen, scores of countries have gained\r\nindependence and universal values of democracy and the\r\nmarket economy are now finding new advocates throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nWe are proud that our small country, which straddles\r\nEurope and Asia, a country with an ancient culture and a\r\nproud history, has not been left behind in the truly universal\r\nhistorical process of the triumph of democracy and national\r\nand economic revival. Azerbaijan regained its independence\r\nless than two years ago. The path travelled by our country\r\nover these 22 months has not been without difficulties and\r\nhas been marked by contradictions and tragic events.\r\nNevertheless, we are convinced that the young State of\r\nAzerbaijan is following the only true path leading to genuine\r\nindependence.\r\nThis has been borne out by the results of the recent\r\npresidential elections held at the beginning of October, when\r\nthe overwhelming majority of the people of Azerbaijan voted\r\nfor Mr. Heydar Aliyev, an experienced politician and\r\nrecognized leader of our country, who is firmly committed\r\nto the idea of building a democratic, secular society with a\r\nmarket economy.\r\nUnfortunately, the natural historical process of the fall\r\nof empires and the acquisition of independence and\r\nstatehood by their peoples is often accompanied by excesses\r\nof extreme nationalism. Many attempt to exploit the\r\ndemocratization of the social and political life of young\r\nindependent States to undermine their internal stability.\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nNationalist separatist movements are often used as a way to\r\nachieve these ends.\r\nUnfortunately, Azerbaijan has fallen victim to such acts\r\nof provocation. For six years now the Republic of Armenia\r\nhas been waging an undeclared war against Azerbaijan to\r\nfulfil its territorial claims. The sad facts of Armenia’s\r\naggression are as follows: 20 per cent of the territory of\r\nAzerbaijan is now occupied by Armenian troops, and\r\n1 million of our country’s civilians have no homes or means\r\nof survival. The economic infrastructure of the Azerbaijani\r\nRepublic’s occupied region has been destroyed. Unique\r\nhistorical and cultural sites of Azerbaijan have been\r\ndestroyed. And all this is occurring under the cover of an\r\nongoing propaganda campaign and alleged non-involvement\r\nby the Republic of Armenia in the aggression.\r\nAzerbaijan has often proclaimed, and continues to\r\nproclaim, its commitment to the principle of the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes. We welcome and commend the\r\nefforts of the international community, the United Nations\r\nand the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(CSCE) as well as the efforts made by individual States -\r\nRussia, the United States, Turkey, Iran and Kazakhstan - in\r\nrecent years to achieve a peaceful settlement of the\r\nArmenia/Azerbaijan conflict.\r\nAzerbaijan welcomed the Security Council’s adoption\r\nof resolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993) calling for the\r\nimmediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of the\r\noccupying forces from Azerbaijan territory that had been\r\nseized. Azerbaijan also welcomed the initial timetable -\r\nworked out within the framework of the Minsk Group of the\r\nCSCE - of urgent steps to implement Security Council\r\nresolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993), several revised drafts\r\nof which, however, were aborted because of the Armenian\r\nside.\r\nAzerbaijan stresses its commitment to the initial\r\napproach of the CSCE - that is, that the Minsk Conference\r\nshould be preceded by the complete liberation of\r\nAzerbaijan’s occupied territories. This was stressed in\r\nparticular by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan,\r\nG. A. Aliyev, yesterday during the reception for CSCE\r\nrepresentatives who are now visiting the region.\r\nWe are confident that, despite certain difficulties -\r\nsometimes substantive - in the approach to the terms of the\r\npeaceful settlement of the conflict, the political realism and\r\nthe sense of responsibility for the fate of our people shown\r\nby the Azerbaijan side will be appreciated by our negotiating\r\npartners.\r\nAzerbaijan, which is richly endowed with a variety of\r\nnatural resources and which has a fairly well-developed\r\nindustrial potential, has all the conditions necessary to\r\novercome our objective difficulties in this transitional period\r\ntowards a market economy.However, since one out of every\r\nsix inhabitants of our country has been forced to leave his\r\nhome and now has no means of survival, as a result of the\r\nhostilities and occupation of one fifth of our territory, the\r\nhumanitarian assistance provided by various international\r\norganizations that have enormous experience in this area is\r\nassuming great importance for our country.\r\nIn this difficult period for my country, Azerbaijan - and\r\nprimarily the people of Azerbaijan, who have suffered most -\r\nhas been given all round support and assistance by the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund, the World Health\r\nOrganization and the International Federation of Red Cross\r\nand Red Crescent Societies. On behalf of my people and\r\nGovernment, I take this opportunity to express profound\r\ngratitude to all international organizations, humanitarian\r\ninstitutions and specialized agencies and the peoples and\r\nGovernments of many States that have responded to the\r\nsuffering of the Azerbaijan people who have fallen victim to\r\naggression.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan also\r\nexpresses profound gratitude to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for having established a United\r\nNations - United Nations Development Programme Interim\r\nOffice in Azerbaijan. We are deeply convinced that the\r\nactivities of this Office will help to strengthen and expand\r\nthe comprehensive relations between our Republic and the\r\nUnited Nations system. We are convinced, also, that this\r\ncooperation will be mutually advantageous in view of the\r\ninitial results of interaction between the Republic of\r\nAzerbaijan and the system of specialized agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations, the majority of which our country joined in\r\n1992 and 1993.\r\nWe attach overriding importance to international\r\ncooperation in the field of the environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment and also to the comprehensive expansion of\r\nworld trade and the elimination of all barriers that restrict\r\nthat process.\r\nAzerbaijan welcomed the decision to convene a World\r\nSummit for Social Development and is prepared to take an\r\nactive part in preparing for that Summit, the successful\r\nconvening of which we believe will lay the basis for an\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 23\r\neffective global development strategy for the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nOur country is taking an active part in the preparations\r\nfor the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements\r\n(Habitat II), which will take place in 1996 in Istanbul.\r\nThus despite the objective and subjective difficulties\r\nencountered by my country, Azerbaijan, during the past year\r\nhas been taking decisive action to integrate itself fully into\r\nthe world community. We are convinced that integration\r\ninto the world’s political, economic and humanitarian\r\nprocess is possible only by increasing cooperation between\r\nStates at the bilateral and multilateral levels.\r\nOur country shares the general conviction regarding the\r\nneed to reduce the threat of the use of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and subsequently to destroy them, has acceded to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\r\nis taking an active part in the preparatory work for the\r\nReview Conference that will take place in 1995. Azerbaijan\r\nsupports the indefinite extension of that Treaty and believes\r\nthat it should be made universal. We are convinced that the\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty is an instrument that strengthens all\r\ninternational efforts and regional initiatives that seek to\r\nprevent any proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nto eliminate obstacles that threaten international and regional\r\npeace and security.\r\nIn this connection we welcome the positive steps taken\r\nrecently in the area of disarmament, including the adoption\r\nof the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\r\non Their Destruction, which was signed by Azerbaijan and\r\nthe majority of countries of the world.\r\nOne outstanding example of our progress towards\r\nbuilding a democratic, lawful State was Azerbaijan’s\r\naccession to the basic instruments of international law in the\r\narea of human rights, such as the International Covenant on\r\nCivil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on\r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child, the Convention relating to the Status of\r\nRefugees (1951) and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status\r\nof Refugees, and some others. Our country is very\r\ninterested in the various initiatives being taken in the area of\r\nprotecting human rights. The idea of establishing, within the\r\nUnited Nations system, a new post of high commissioner for\r\nhuman rights, reflects an intention to enhance international\r\ncooperation in this area. We are prepared actively to\r\nparticipate in the discussions on this question.\r\nAnother pressing issue, one that requires urgent and\r\nconstant attention, is that of refugees and displaced persons.\r\nIt is time for the international community to draw up proper\r\nrules and standards to govern massive, forced migrations\r\nwhich could help overcome their main causes and\r\nconsequences.\r\nDesirous of making a worthy contribution to the various\r\nareas of the activities of the United Nations, Azerbaijan\r\nsubmitted its candidacy for, and was elected to, the\r\nCommission on Human Settlements and the\r\nIntergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology\r\nfor Development. We are convinced that the great scientific\r\npotential and practical experience of our specialists will help\r\nthese commissions to do effective work.\r\nIn 1995 the United Nations will celebrate its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. In the almost five decades that have elapsed\r\nsince the United Nations was created, its historic meaning\r\nand universality have become strikingly clear. Today it is\r\ntime for serious, meaningful changes, changes commensurate\r\nwith the needs of our rapidly changing world. We believe\r\nthat, given the new context of international relations, the\r\nrestructuring of the United Nations, and particularly of the\r\nSecurity Council, must meet the great expectations of\r\nMember States. Expansion of the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, the need for which is the subject of serious\r\ndiscussion, should help the Council continue effectively to\r\ndischarge its primary task, that of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.Of course the role and\r\nresponsibility of the Secretary-General will shift towards\r\nenhanced peacemaking and diplomatic activity.\r\nIn conclusion, we look to the future with optimism, to\r\na future where peace and cooperation will prosper. We call\r\nupon States Members of the United Nations to make every\r\neffort to promote the establishment of a safe, secure,\r\ncommon home. We are sure that constructive discussions\r\nand debates at this session will make an important\r\ncontribution to the building of a better world in the coming\r\ncentury.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Albania, who wishes to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and five for the second and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMr. DUMI (Albania): I regret having to speak\r\nagain in exercise of the right of reply, but, the statement\r\nmade last week by the representative of the republic of\r\nGreece, in exercise of his right of reply, requires the\r\nfollowing clarifications.\r\nThe representative of Greece called on the Republic of\r\nAlbania to respect the right of national minorities in the\r\nsame way as Greece does. As a country newly emerged\r\nfrom dictatorship, Albania has much to learn and to put into\r\npractice as it progresses towards application of the most\r\nadvanced European common values. Indeed, it is doing so.\r\nHowever, although we gave a friendly welcome to the Greek\r\nsuggestion, I must point out that my country is not prepared\r\nto adopt the Greek practice: denial of the existence of the\r\nnational minorities within its borders.\r\nIt is well known that there are several ethnic minority\r\ngroups living in Greece, arbitrarily unrecognized and\r\npersecuted by the Greek authorities. I shall just focus on an\r\nimportant large one - tens of thousands of Muslim Albanians\r\nliving in Chamiria. Beginning about 50 years ago, they have\r\nbeen subjected to forced deportation to Albania and Turkey,\r\nforced to leave their ancestral land and abandon their\r\nproperty. Moreover, for many decades the Orthodox Chami\r\npeople and the old Albanian community in Greece, known\r\nas Arvanitei, have been subjected to different assimilation\r\npractices. They are denied all rights - even the most\r\nfundamental human right: the right to declare and develop\r\ntheir national identity.Their rights, as provided for in\r\ninternational law, must be restored and scrupulously\r\nrespected.\r\nThis question should be considered in parallel with that\r\nof the rights of the Greek minority in Albania, since the\r\nprinciple of reciprocity applies equally to all States and\r\nnations. We have already presented our views to the Greek\r\nauthorities. Albania will continue to work, bilaterally and\r\nmultilaterally, on this issue, and we are confident that\r\ncommon language can and will be found.\r\nDialogue and understanding must prevail in dealing\r\nwith issues concerning the treatment of minorities. To this\r\nend, Albania has shown good will and a constructive spirit.\r\nHowever, the use of pressure and of related tactics, such as\r\nthe Greek authorities’ recent forced expulsion and ill-\r\ntreatment of more than 20,000 Albanian migrants, is not the\r\nway to solve these problems, nor is it in accordance with the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)\r\nprocess.\r\nAs regards the Greek allegation, that the Albanian\r\nMission misrepresented\r\n\"the content of a letter ... by the CSCE High\r\nCommissioner on National Minorities\", (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Forty-eighth Session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 19th meeting)\r\nMr. van der Stoel’s report is realistic and objective and\r\nexposes as artificial the noise made by Greece about the\r\nsituation of the Greek minority in Albania.\r\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 25\r\nFinally, I am authorized to reiterate the statement made\r\nhere by Albania’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the\r\nAlbanian democratic Government\r\n\"is determined to build a modern State and a civilized\r\nsociety, based on respect for the human rights of all\r\nstrata of the population without exception or\r\ndiscrimination.\" (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-eighth Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th\r\nmeeting)\r\nNo doubt this will be made a reality through deeds rather\r\nthan words, but, as an old saying goes, Babylon was not\r\nbuilt overnight.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n"
