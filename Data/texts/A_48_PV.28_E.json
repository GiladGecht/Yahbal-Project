"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n28th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nWednesday, 13 October 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. MOSES (Federated States of Micronesia): On\r\nbehalf of the Federated States of Micronesia, I am honoured\r\nthis morning to address the General Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session, and I bring the warm greetings of our\r\nPresident and our people.\r\nGiven the many challenges facing the Organization and\r\nthe entire world in the coming year, we are pleased by your\r\nelection, Mr. President. You have our confidence and\r\nsupport as you assume this high office, so ably discharged\r\nby your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who\r\nenjoyed our respect and gratitude.\r\nSpecial recognition must also be given to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, under whose\r\nleadership the United Nations has taken difficult steps in a\r\nprocess of redefinition and reorganization, which is\r\nnecessary if we are to take advantage of the opportunities\r\npresented by the new world order and work together in the\r\ninterests of all mankind.\r\nDuring the past year we have seen the membership of\r\nthe United Nations draw ever closer to the goal of\r\nuniversality. We thus congratulate the Czech Republic, the\r\nSlovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Eritrea, Monaco and Andorra, and to each of\r\nthem we extend a welcome and pledge cooperation and\r\nfriendship.\r\nOur people are deeply saddened by the loss of life and\r\nthe suffering caused by the earthquake in India last month,\r\nand we express to the Indian people our sincere sympathy\r\nand pledge to them that we will participate in any effort\r\nundertaken by this Organization.\r\nNot many years ago, the appropriate role of the\r\n\"micro-States\" within the world community was to be seen\r\nbut seldom heard, and even to be excluded from many\r\nforums. In our own small island developing State, we, as\r\nthe body politic of a classic \"micro-State\", hesitated to assert\r\nour views on international affairs, thinking that a small\r\nnation could not make a difference in or have an impact\r\nupon the resolution of global issues.\r\nToday I draw attention to a significant but less\r\nnoticeable feature of the new order. Throughout history,\r\ninternational relations have been conducted on a competitive\r\nbasis, where power and size made a difference. But I am\r\nhappy to note that things have changed for the better, that a\r\nchange has begun to take place; and I think it is one that has\r\ngathered increased momentum even within the past few\r\nyears. Nations large and small, in the process of working\r\ntogether under the Charter, have begun to focus their\r\nattention and direct their efforts along the lines of\r\ncommonality of interests and problems - and not merely to\r\npay lip-service. Indeed there is a growing, genuine\r\nphenomenon, which is seen partly in the unfolding of events\r\nin New York, but even more clearly in the impressive\r\noutcomes of the Rio Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment and the recent World Conference on Human\r\nRights. Another sign is the entire world community’s keen\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86861 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.28\r\n4 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nanticipation of the upcoming Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nI do not mean to suggest a disappearance of national\r\ninterests; but, across a wide spectrum of social, development\r\nand even security matters, there is a growing recognition that\r\ncommon interests give strength to new alliances on an\r\ninclusive rather than exclusive basis. Thus, there is good\r\nreason for continued progress towards self-determination\r\namong peoples, since they can now be confident that they\r\nwill not be alone in addressing the great difficulties of\r\nstarting out. For similar reasons, many of the \"micro-States\"\r\nhave concluded recently that membership in this\r\nOrganization is imperative, despite the burdens and\r\nresponsibilities involved.\r\nAs this session of the General Assembly proceeds, we\r\nare becoming aware of the changes in the Organization in\r\nterms of organization, administration and policy. There may\r\nbe some who doubt that Members have the will or\r\ncommitment to achieve consensus on these changes and to\r\nre-establish the proper financial basis for a United Nations\r\nthat can be responsive to the present. I submit, however,\r\nthat any such doubts must be dispelled during our work here\r\nin the coming months, for we simply cannot afford to fail.\r\nThe United Nations is no longer an optional feature of the\r\ninternational community. The common concerns of mankind\r\nin the great issues to which I alluded earlier cannot be\r\naddressed from behind national fences. And so, I appeal to\r\nall Members to commit themselves fully to reaching at this\r\nsession the goal of preparing the United Nations to become\r\nthe central instrument through which we can work to secure\r\nthe future well-being of our peoples.\r\nI believe that the direct experience of my country\r\nwithin our brief time as a Member provides unmistakable\r\nevidence of the strength of concerted, international action.\r\nOnly a few years ago, having emerged from colonialism, our\r\nbest hopes for development lay in dependence for an\r\nindefinite period on the generosity of a few friends, chief\r\namong them the United States. Moreover, as inhabitants of\r\nsmall, low-lying islands, we were helpless in the face of the\r\nlooming threat of sea-level rise and other natural disasters\r\ncaused by human-induced climate change.\r\nToday, through the work of this body and with our\r\nparticipation, the special development needs and\r\nenvironmental concerns of all small island developing States\r\nare being carefully addressed in a number of settings,\r\nincluding the Conventions on climate change and\r\nbiodiversity and the follow-up activities of the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\r\n(UNCED). The early work of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development promises attention to our problems,\r\nas can be seen in the upcoming first Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates.\r\nAll this is not happening because of an outburst of\r\ncharitable sympathy by the developed countries, but rather\r\nin the context of addressing a complex of issues in which\r\npeoples everywhere have a stake. Herein, I think, lies the\r\nreal strength and value of the United Nations - to us and to\r\nall.\r\nDuring the past year, my Government has found\r\nencouragement in the ways in which this Organization as a\r\nwhole recognizes the difficulties that small States encounter\r\nas they try to participate fully in its work. We deeply\r\nappreciate the opportunities afforded to us through the\r\ncontribution of Members to voluntary funds that have\r\nenabled our participation in important functions. We also\r\nacknowledge the instances where calls by small States for\r\nthe holding of meetings here in New York to make our\r\npresence possible have been heard. Furthermore, we\r\nappreciate that, whenever possible, special measures for our\r\nbenefit - such as limiting the number of simultaneous\r\nmeetings - are being taken.\r\nFor our part, small States are now more often coming\r\ntogether on common issues to speak with one voice for\r\ngreater effectiveness and efficiency. Here, I cite the\r\nAlliance of Small Island States as a successful example on\r\nthe issue of climate change and other UNCED-related\r\nmatters. In a more general sense, the regional groups\r\noperate to the benefit of small States, affording us\r\nopportunities of access to elected positions by virtue of\r\nallocations and the principle of rotation. I am sure there are\r\nother factors favourable to us that I have failed to mention\r\nhere.\r\nYet, even with all this, I must state that we are very\r\nhard pressed to participate in the broad range of United\r\nNations activities, both financially and owing to the sheer\r\nvolume and complexity of those activities. For this reason,\r\nand because so many other Members are in similar\r\nsituations, I propose that the United Nations, as part of its\r\nreorganization efforts, undertake a comprehensive\r\nexamination of the obstacles that exist to the full\r\nparticipation of small States with a view towards identifying\r\ninstitutional rather than ad hoc solutions. After all,\r\nachieving universality in the United Nations would be a\r\nhollow accomplishment so long as a significant number of\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 3\r\nMembers remain incapable of reaching their effective\r\npotential within the Organization. We look forward to\r\naddressing this issue during the course of the forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nMy country is a member of the South Pacific Forum,\r\nan organization of Governments of Pacific island countries\r\nwhich, each year prior to this date, meets to address matters\r\nof concern to our region and to provide an expression of our\r\njoint views on many issues before this body. I wish to state\r\nour complete solidarity with that expression, contained in the\r\ncommuniqué from our recent meeting in the Republic of\r\nNauru, which will be presented for incorporation in the\r\nrecords of this Assembly.\r\nThe Forum members have been outspoken in opposing\r\nthe testing of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Our optimism ran very high at the Nauru\r\nmeeting because it seemed that at last the nuclear Powers\r\nhad found the resolve to bring this dangerous chapter of\r\nhistory to an end. Now, with reports of a recent test by one\r\nof them, the Federated States of Micronesia is deeply\r\nconcerned that the great progress made towards achieving a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty will be reversed. We\r\ncall on all nuclear Powers not to treat this recent aberration\r\nas an incentive to turn backwards, but rather to restore and\r\nhold to their collective discipline.\r\nThe issue of fundamental human rights is interwoven\r\ninto every aspect of the activities undertaken by this body.\r\nFor too long many Governments have been content to avoid\r\nconfronting it directly as a matter of multilateral\r\nresponsibility. I am glad to say that we sense some\r\nimprovement in the situation despite continuing occurrences\r\nof the most repugnant kinds of human rights violations.\r\nIn this decade, we have witnessed unprecedented\r\nchanges in world conditions, brought about in part by a\r\ngrowing unanimity of resolve among peoples to express and\r\nexercise their fundamental human rights. Recently,\r\nprominent States have been dismantled, leading to the\r\nformation of other States that afford broader opportunities\r\nfor the expression of these rights. Sadly, at the same time,\r\nother States continue to go to great lengths to suppress them.\r\nThe world finds itself rejoicing in newly established\r\nfreedoms but also feeling deep revulsion over atrocities and\r\nrepression of shocking magnitude. If any lesson emerges\r\nfrom this dichotomy, it must be that isolated progress is not\r\nenough and that fundamental human rights issues can no\r\nlonger be relegated to the background in a set of supposedly\r\nhigher multilateral priorities. Rather, human rights must be\r\nthe cornerstone of our work, which must be guided by the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\r\nAccordingly, my Government expresses its support for\r\nthe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action agreed\r\nupon at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna\r\nin June this year. We support the adoption of that\r\nDeclaration by the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nIn keeping with the principles of that Declaration, I\r\nwish to affirm my Government’s strong and unconditional\r\nsupport for the universality of human rights and for the\r\neffective multilateral instruments that give meaning and\r\ndefinition to the concept.\r\nAs an early priority, our new nation has undertaken a\r\nclose examination of the existing instruments with a view to\r\nfreely assuming obligations under them, as is consistent with\r\nour Constitution. As a first step, we have acceded to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, and we anticipate\r\nfurther action on other instruments as well.\r\nOne of the very important concerns that is interlinked\r\nwith all our Government’s hopes for a better future is the\r\nrights of women. We fully support the development of\r\neffective new instruments in the cause of women’s rights in\r\norder to secure their protection against discrimination and\r\nabuse.\r\nAs a nation comprised entirely of indigenous peoples,\r\nmy Government also expresses its solidarity with all\r\nindigenous peoples of the world and particularly those\r\nsubjected to deprivation of their fundamental human rights\r\nwithin their own homelands.\r\nIn this the International Decade for the Eradication of\r\nColonialism it is important that this body redouble its efforts\r\nto ensure that the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories are given every opportunity to exercise\r\ntheir right to self-determination and self-government. While\r\nthe obstacles to self-determination for the remaining\r\nTerritories are minor compared to those that are being\r\nconfronted so dramatically in Eastern Europe and in\r\nPalestine, it remains our moral responsibility to support the\r\nright to self-determination for all peoples under colonial\r\nadministration.\r\nToday, the enlarged membership of the United Nations\r\nis in itself strong testimony to the success of decolonization;\r\nlet us hark back to our own earlier struggles and recommit\r\nourselves to the complete elimination of colonialism.\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMy Government welcomes the establishment of the\r\nInternational Tribunal, and the recent election of its\r\nmembers, to try perpetrators of war crimes in the former\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. Still, we would support the\r\nestablishment of a permanent international human rights\r\ntribunal. The independent, juridical composition of any such\r\nbody should place it above concerns regarding political\r\nintervention while denying human rights violators any refuge\r\nfrom defined international responsibility.\r\nThe Government of the Federated States of Micronesia\r\nattaches great importance to the issue of fundamental human\r\nrights, and will continue to participate in the work of this\r\nbody towards a world community in which all peoples live\r\nwithout threat of encroachment upon these fundamental\r\nrights.\r\nIt has been well established by actions of this body that\r\nthe right to development is itself a fundamental human right.\r\nBut to recognize a right is one thing: to secure the exercise\r\nof that right is much more difficult. A great deal is said and\r\ndone here at the United Nations every year to address the\r\nneeds of developing countries and peoples, not to mention\r\nthe considerable resources that are mobilized bilaterally\r\ntowards that end. Yet we continue to see wide variations in\r\nthe degree of effectiveness of that assistance and in the\r\nresults of efforts by developing countries themselves.\r\nThis has led an increasing number of us to question\r\nwhether there might not exist a number of identifiable\r\nfactors that prevent development efforts from achieving\r\nsuccess. If those factors could be defined with precision and\r\nrecognized where they are present, it might well be possible\r\nto attain significant increases in economies and outcomes.\r\nOn Papua New Guinea’s welcome suggestion, and with its\r\nwelcome leadership - and after considerable discussion and\r\nextensive exchanges of views between eminent leaders in the\r\ndeveloping world - this matter has been placed before the\r\nAssembly as agenda item 151, entitled \"United Nations\r\ninitiative on opportunity and participation\". We shall join\r\nothers in sponsoring a draft resolution to be presented under\r\nthis item and calling for a comprehensive, systematic and\r\nthorough study of the encumbrances to full opportunity and\r\nparticipation in development, with particular reference to the\r\neconomies of developing countries. If properly supported\r\nand carried out, this initiative would make possible\r\nsignificant breakthroughs in the effort to secure this\r\nimportant and fundamental human right, with equality and\r\nequity for all.\r\nThe Federated States of Micronesia pays a tribute to the\r\nenlightened men and women who gave life to the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\r\n(UNCED) process and focused the world’s attention on the\r\nneed to begin replacing wasteful and polluting practices with\r\nsustainable development. This movement is especially\r\nwell-timed for my country, since our development planning\r\nis still in the early stages and, as a consequence, and with\r\nthe encouragement and support of the world community, we\r\nnow have in place a national environmental management\r\nstrategy that provides an essential complement to our\r\ndevelopment-planning efforts.\r\nWe intend for our country to become a model of\r\neffective partnership with other nations, and with this body,\r\ndemonstrating the application of new, clean technologies in\r\norder to accommodate sustainable development within a\r\nsmall, pristine environment.\r\nOf course, as a nation of remote and widely dispersed\r\nsmall islands, many of which are low-lying atolls, we\r\nexperience all the difficulties recognized in section G of\r\nchapter 17 of Agenda 21 as inhibiting the development of\r\nsmall island countries. Thus, we are thankful for the\r\nopportunity now before us to enhance general understanding\r\nof those difficulties through the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island States.\r\nAs a member of the Alliance of Small Island States, we\r\nare participating fully in that process. It was most\r\nencouraging to note, at the recent preparatory conference, the\r\nstrong participation by developed countries and also the solid\r\nsupport from our colleagues in the Group of 77. We shall\r\nfully reciprocate that support in all appropriate settings\r\nbecause, despite our awareness of our own problems, we\r\nknow that virtually all developing countries exhibit one or\r\nmore disabling characteristics that distinguish them from the\r\nothers. While we are part of a relatively large grouping of\r\ncountries that share similar characteristics and disabilities, all\r\ndeveloping countries deserve to have attention paid to their\r\nparticular obstacles to development.\r\nIn that light, we perceive the Barbados Conference next\r\nyear as an important early milestone in the post-Rio process,\r\nnot only for small island developing States but for all\r\nnations, developed and developing, that believe as we do in\r\nthe Rio Declaration and in Agenda 21. The Barbados\r\nConference is, in our view, the first real test of Agenda 21.\r\nIt may seem at times that we of the region of the\r\nPacific islands are overly-preoccupied about our\r\nenvironment, and that we take too broad a view of the\r\npotential impact resulting from the actions of others. We\r\nraise our voices loudly and often on the subject of\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 5\r\nhuman-induced climate change and sea-level rise, but many\r\nsay that it may not happen. We speak out against nuclear\r\ntesting, especially in and among our islands, but those who\r\nare more powerful say that it probably is not harmful. We\r\nstrongly urge that lethal toxic substances such as plutonium\r\nand chemical weapons not be transported through or stored\r\nwithin our region, but even some of our closest friends do so\r\nregardless, insisting that in all likelihood there is no danger.\r\nAre we too concerned? Are we naive? I believe that we are\r\nnot, because the Pacific region appears to be a vast, thinly\r\npopulated ocean area and thus a prime location for the dirty\r\nbusiness of others - but that region is our home and our\r\nresponsibility.\r\nNot only must we provide for ourselves from its\r\nbounty, but we are also stewards of what is coming to be\r\nrecognized in scientific circles as the last remaining great\r\nunspoiled natural resource of the planet. Our fisheries are\r\nplentiful, but they could be threatened if experiences\r\nelsewhere in the world are repeated. Our air is still clean,\r\nbut we now know we are vulnerable to occurrences\r\nelsewhere. Our water is still pure, but we have seen other\r\nseas contaminated by unsustainable practices. We must, and\r\nwill continue to, speak out.\r\nOur region is not simply the victim of the callous\r\ndisregard of the powerful for the consequences visited upon\r\nthe poor or the weak. Rather, we recognize that for\r\ncenturies mankind has regarded the vast oceans as free\r\nspace, open to all passage and exploitation. Although\r\nexclusive economic zones and multilateral treaties have had\r\nmajor impact, the fact remains that the Pacific Ocean is\r\ntoday the world’s ultimate \"back yard\".\r\nMy country’s plea, then, is quite simple and\r\nstraightforward. We call on all members of the world\r\ncommunity to join us, in the spirit of Rio, in a true\r\npartnership for the sustainable development, not just of one\r\nor more Pacific island countries, but of our ocean and all\r\nthat is in it. One important focus must, of course, be upon\r\nthe land and coastal areas within our region, in order to\r\naccommodate appropriate development without degrading\r\neither the land or its surrounding marine space. But another,\r\nbroader, focus must be on the ocean itself - to respect and\r\nbuild upon the growing scientific knowledge of its complex\r\necological systems.\r\nIt is well known that the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia, along with other low-lying island countries of\r\nthe World, is literally frightened that its scarce land space\r\nmay be made uninhabitable and ultimately disappear if even\r\nthe moderate predictions of global warming and sea-level\r\nrise come to pass. But if this were the only concern with\r\nregard to human-induced climate change, loss of biodiversity\r\nand unsustainable development, we would be hard put to call\r\nupon the world at large to make fundamental changes in the\r\nway it lives. Ours, however, is by no means an isolated\r\nconcern. As the South Pacific Forum Heads of Government\r\nhave stressed for some years, the fate of the islands is an\r\nadvance warning of things to come, as we have predicted.\r\nThanks to the trends that I discussed earlier in respect\r\nof the modern realignment of motivations for international\r\ncooperation, I have tremendous confidence that we, and our\r\nchildren and their children, will succeed not only in\r\npreserving the environment but also in maintaining the pace\r\ntowards the ultimate goals of peace, enjoyment of human\r\nrights and social enrichment, as enshrined in the Charter.\r\nMy country pledges its efforts within this great Organization,\r\nduring this forty-eighth session of the General Assembly and\r\nafterwards, towards the attainment of these ends.\r\nMr. SAEMALA (Solomon Islands): Let me extend to\r\nyou, Sir, the warm greetings of my Government and the\r\npeople of Solomon Islands. We congratulate you on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at this forty-\r\neighth session. Your experience, diplomatic skills and\r\nleadership assure us of a successful and fruitful session.\r\nI also join in the tributes paid to your distinguished\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria,\r\nfor the excellent manner in which he presided over the\r\naffairs of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe join, too, in acknowledging and commending the\r\nreport (A/48/1) of the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, His Excellency Mr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali, on the\r\nwork of the Organization. The report is a comprehensive\r\ncatalogue of the achievements of the United Nations, its\r\nstrengths and weaknesses, the threats and opportunities the\r\nOrganization faces and the challenges it has before it. All\r\nthese point to one common truth: there is an undeniable\r\ndisparity between idealism and reality, between the mounting\r\nresponsibilities of the Organization and its capacity to\r\nachieve pragmatic, focused and specific goals. The gap\r\nbetween promotion of the ideals of the Charter and\r\nrealization of them continues to widen.\r\nOver the last three weeks, we have heard Member\r\nStates renewing their support for, and commitment to, this\r\nbody. It is clear that the Organization is calling out for our\r\nattention. It needs us all, just as much as we need it;\r\nperhaps it now needs us more than ever before to strengthen\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nit and enhance its performance in its delivery of services and\r\ngoods to our many peoples around the globe.\r\nMr. President, your opening statement 22 days ago\r\nconcluded with the visionary challenge, \"We the peoples -\r\nunited for a better world\" (A/48/PV.1). In the spirit of a\r\nfamily of nations, the United Nations will be celebrating this\r\ntheme at its fiftieth anniversary in 1995. While Solomon\r\nIslands shares this vision, it counsels against extravagance,\r\nwaste and mere symbolistic ceremonials which do not reflect\r\nlong-term substantive benefits. To mark the occasion with\r\nserious reflection, education and communication, careful\r\nplanning and a wider consultation programme at all levels of\r\nthe international community will be essential. Awareness\r\nprogrammes and activities aimed at promoting the principle\r\nof unity in diversity should be a key to strength and wealth,\r\nboth for nations and for the global community. A goal\r\nwhich can be promoted during the fiftieth-anniversary\r\ncelebrations is that of world citizenship, or citizens of planet\r\nEarth.\r\nThe basis for this should be very simple: everyone\r\nliving on this planet has a responsibility for its sustainable\r\ngrowth. Everyone must be aware of, and feel concerned at,\r\nthe possibility of our destroying the planet. Individuals\r\nmake up communities. Communities make up nations.\r\nNations make up the global community. The global\r\ncommunity lives on this planet.\r\nMr. Wlosowicz (Poland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nCitizens of Planet Earth, or world citizenship, is a\r\nunifying vision of a peaceful, prosperous global society.\r\nThis emerges from a sense of responsibility and the\r\nacceptance of the oneness of humanity. To embrace this\r\nvision of world citizenship into the twenty-first century,\r\nleaders and Governments must change their attitudes to take\r\non the greatest challenge facing the world community -\r\nreleasing the enormous financial, technical, human and moral\r\nresources required for the sustainable development of our\r\nplanet. Can we collectively face this challenge in order to\r\nimplement the various components of Agenda 21? The\r\nanswer lies in the hands of the people and the nations of the\r\nworld. How can we make this theme a reality - a reality not\r\nonly for us at this time but also for future generations on\r\nthis planet?\r\nI was heartened to hear the President of the United\r\nStates, Mr. Bill Clinton, say these words on the first day of\r\nthe general debate:\r\n\"The United States intends to remain engaged and to\r\nlead.\" (A/48/PV.4, p. 8)\r\nHe also went on to say:\r\n\"... we must and will serve as a fulcrum for change and\r\na pivot point for peace.\" (ibid.)\r\nThe Solomon Islands is currently working with the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme on a pilot\r\nprogramme called \"Children of Planet Earth\" (COPE).\r\nCOPE is an environmental educational-awareness\r\nprogramme aimed at primary-school children. It will be\r\nincorporated into the school curriculum as a module\r\ncompulsory for all children. There will be no pass or fail\r\ngrade, but any child who completes the module will get a\r\nUnited Nations badge or a certificate. The module will\r\nfocus on the environment and on sustainable growth, and\r\nnational, regional and international perspectives will be built\r\ninto it. The Solomon Islands strongly believes that\r\neducation with regard to the environment is important and\r\ndeserves priority investment. The target group is the\r\nchildren, because they will be the leaders of tomorrow.\r\nTwo weeks ago, His Excellency Shimon Peres, Israeli\r\nForeign Minister, described war and peace in this way:\r\n\"In war, the old bury the young, and in peace, the\r\nyoung bury the old.\"\r\nI thought this was quite revealing. It tells of a reality,\r\na reality which has written a new chapter with a change of\r\nheart. The handshake between Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization leader Mr. Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister\r\nMr. Rabin on Capitol Hill symbolized a major milestone in\r\nMiddle East history. The Solomon Islands welcomes this\r\ngreat advancement in human relations between these two\r\nnations. It is hoped that the process of creating forgiveness\r\nand trust will pave the way for lasting peace in the Middle\r\nEast. I applaud the countries that have pledged financial\r\nassistance or assistance in kind to Palestine.\r\nThe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly\r\nopened at the dawn of a new era in South African history.\r\nAfrican National Congress leader Mr. Nelson Mandela,\r\nrenowned for his struggle against apartheid, made a moving\r\nstatement at this very rostrum requesting the lifting of\r\neconomic sanctions against South Africa. To see Mr.\r\nMandela and President De Klerk moving towards South\r\nAfrica’s first non-racial elections is an immense and\r\npromising change. At last, both leaders have decided to\r\ntravel in the same bus of democracy. We too join the rest\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 7\r\nof the world in welcoming this first historic step towards\r\nmajority rule in South Africa.\r\nThe parameters for the global agenda of the United\r\nNations General Assembly have evolved slowly over the\r\nyears. However, not only have agenda items changed from\r\ntime to time, but they have increased in number as well.\r\nThe issues before the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly fall into the following broad categories: first,\r\nmaking and keeping peace; second, arms controls and\r\ndisarmament; third, economics and development; fourth,\r\nglobal resource management; fifth, human rights and other\r\nsocial issues; sixth, international legal issues; and seventh,\r\nfinancing and administration of the United Nations.\r\nEach of these broad headings receives a thorough\r\nsurvey and analysis at every session of the General\r\nAssembly from both the developed and the developing parts\r\nof the globe. Some speakers focus specifically on certain\r\nissues, such as making and keeping peace, or arms control\r\nand disarmament; others draw the General Assembly’s\r\nattention to such matters as economic development, global-\r\nresources management, human rights and other social issues.\r\nThe debate so far has been interesting.\r\nA quick overview of what has been said so far from\r\nthis rostrum reveals a global picture that is both bright and\r\ngloomy. One truth, articulated by almost every speaker in\r\nthe area of world peace and security is that the threat of\r\nconflicts between States has not diminished, even after the\r\nsuper-Power rivalry has been eroded. Senator Gareth Evans,\r\nthe Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, captured the\r\nquestion of world peace and security in a more imperative\r\nway when he addressed this Assembly at its 5th meeting, on\r\n27 September. He referred to the resurgence of\r\nethno-nationalism, which often takes a violent form, giving\r\nethnic groups a claim to minority human rights protection as\r\nwell as a claim to self-determination.\r\nSpeaking on behalf of the European Communities,\r\nMr. Willy Claes, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Belgium, patrolled the\r\nmajor trouble spots of the world in a memorandum attached\r\nto his statement. The Solomon Islands appreciates the\r\nefforts of the European Communities in resolving regional\r\nconflicts throughout the world and welcomes its commitment\r\nto world peace and security. The Balkan crisis has become\r\na cryptic jigsaw puzzle. Human suffering continues.\r\nPeacemakers and peace-keepers have tried, and are still\r\ntrying, to find a solution. The Solomon Islands deplores the\r\natrocities committed and appeals to the nations with ways\r\nand means to bring peace to this region. As peace is being\r\ngiven a chance in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Latin\r\nAmerica and the South Pacific regions, so may it be given\r\na chance in the Balkan region.\r\nIn his address to the General Assembly on 28\r\nSeptember, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian\r\nFederation referred to the Bosnian conflict and remarked:\r\n\"... the key to the settlement of many conflicts has not\r\nyet been found.\" (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-eight Session, Plenary Meetings, 6th\r\nMeeting, p. 15)\r\nHe also said:\r\n\"In any case, it is surely time to think of establishing\r\ncloser contacts between the United Nations and the\r\nworld’s leading religions.\" (ibid., p. 15)\r\nIt appears that there is a missing dimension to the\r\napproaches employed in conflict resolution.\r\nAs we consider the growing number of problems\r\nconfronting our world, we cannot escape the feeling that the\r\nsolutions will not simply be political, economic or social. In\r\nmany cases, the problems are so complex and so deep-seated\r\nthat we need superhuman help. A new prescription for true\r\npeace must include the development of the spiritual and\r\npastoral well-being of all peoples around the world.\r\nTo this important extent, my Government recognizes,\r\nas its first principle,\r\n\"the sovereignty of God as the basis of\r\nrighteousness, justice and dignity in the\r\ndevelopment of the Solomon Islands and its\r\npeople.\"\r\nWe realize that neither the individual nor society can achieve\r\nfull potential without the help of Almighty God. If God is\r\nsovereign in the affairs of our world, would we not be wise\r\nto bring Him into the planning process as well as give Him\r\na place in the resolution of conflicts, whether national,\r\nregional or global?\r\nThe question of New Caledonia, in the South Pacific,\r\nhas been on the agenda of the United Nations for some\r\ntime - but not for much longer, I hope. Solomon Islands\r\njoins its colleagues in the South Pacific region in endorsing\r\nthe recent report on New Caledonia of the Ministerial\r\nCommittee of the South Pacific Forum. As a member of\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthat Committee, I hereby humbly express our appreciation\r\nand gratitude for the cooperation and support of the French\r\nand territorial authorities in facilitating the recent visit of\r\nMinisters to the Territory. My Government also reaffirms\r\nits strong support for the Committee’s recommendations and\r\nrenews its firm support for the aspirations and goals of the\r\npeople of New Caledonia, including the Kanak community.\r\nWe note the progress of the Matignon Accords, and, while\r\nsensitive to the varying and conflicting interpretations and\r\nexpectations, we urge all parties to maintain their\r\ncommitment to the Matignon process and to the promotion\r\nof economic, political and social development in New\r\nCaledonia.\r\nThe United Nations is a strong supporter of peace.\r\nThis noble world body has, to date, supported the\r\nreunification of the two Germanys and of the two Koreas.\r\nIn this context, reunification means only one thing - the\r\nuniting of people. Unification means peace and coexistence.\r\nConflicts in areas around the world should be resolved\r\nthrough dialogue. Thus, we believe that the United Nations\r\nmechanism that was used in the case of Germany and in the\r\ncase of the two Koreas should be applied to the situation\r\ninvolving the Republic of China and the People’s Republic\r\nof China.\r\nSolomon Islands recognizes the need for reunification\r\nof the two Chinas through good will and in good faith. We\r\ncall on both to hold talks, on equal terms, on the basis of\r\nthis important United Nations principle. But the process can\r\nbe successful only if this world body considers the\r\nexceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in\r\nthe international context, based on the principle of\r\nuniversality of membership and in accordance with the\r\nestablished model of parallel representation of divided\r\ncountries at the United Nations.\r\nSolomon Islands fully recognizes and strongly supports\r\nthe wish of the people of the Republic of China to rejoin the\r\nUnited Nations. As a small, friendly nation with a\r\npopulation of only about 300,000, Solomon Islands firmly\r\nbelieves that the desire of the 21 million people of the\r\nRepublic of China in Taiwan for their own representation in\r\nthis world body is reasonable and justified. We are sure that\r\nthe international community would benefit from the positive\r\ncontribution that the Republic of China is capable of making\r\nto this Organization. Our own country has benefited, in the\r\npast 10 years, from the economic development and\r\ntechnological progress that the people of the Republic of\r\nChina have secured through achieving for their country such\r\na high position in the league of the industrialized nations.\r\nSolomon Islands therefore supports the call from other\r\nMember States for the establishment of an ad hoc committee\r\nto examine the question of the Republic of China rejoining\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe mere existence of weapons of mass destruction\r\nposes a big threat to global peace and security. However,\r\neven more worrying is the potential proliferation of nuclear,\r\nchemical, biological and ballistic missiles - the danger of\r\ntheir falling into the wrong hands. We applaud the countries\r\nthat have taken positive steps towards the elimination of\r\nthese weapons. We also welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on new dimensions of arms regulation and\r\ndisarmament in the post-cold-war era. We believe in the\r\nintegration of arms-regulation efforts into the broader\r\nstructure of international peace and security, the\r\nglobalization of arms control and of the disarmament process\r\nand the revitalization of arms control. We strongly propose\r\nthat the arms-control and disarmament agenda clearly reflect\r\nthe realities of the post-cold-war era. This is the challenge\r\nfor the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nTurning to nuclear testing in our region, I must say that\r\nour continuing desire and concern is to ensure that the South\r\nPacific region remains a nuclear-free zone and a zone free\r\nof all types of radioactive waste. Solomon Islands therefore\r\nmaintains its support for further suspension of nuclear testing\r\nin our region. We warmly welcome the decisions of the\r\nUnited States, Russia and France to extend their testing\r\nmoratoriums. In this vein, owing to recent developments,\r\nwe call upon China and the United Kingdom seriously to\r\nconsider declaring similar moratoriums.\r\nSolomon Islands is gravely concerned about the\r\ndumping of radioactive and other waste at sea. We therefore\r\nurge the States parties to the London Dumping Convention\r\nof 1972, when they adopt amendments in November this\r\nyear, to continue their active support for a total ban on such\r\ndumping.\r\nThe shipment of plutonium, with the danger that it\r\nposes to the fragile marine ecosystem of the South Pacific,\r\nis a matter of major concern to the Governments of the\r\nregion. The highest international safety and security\r\nstandards must be adhered to. Any nation engaging in this\r\nbusiness must satisfactorily address all possible\r\ncontingencies.\r\nThere is a clear message in statements issued by States\r\nmembers of the Group of 77. It points to the increasing\r\nconnection between environmental concerns and\r\ndevelopmental issues, to the delicate balance between the\r\nenvironment and development, between population and\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 9\r\ndevelopment, and between good government and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMember countries of the South Pacific Forum were\r\nwell represented at the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro,\r\nBrazil, in June 1992. A principal outcome of the Rio\r\nConference is Agenda 21 - an action plan for the 1990s and\r\nthe twenty-first century. It sets forth strategies and\r\nintegrated-programme measures to halt and reverse the\r\neffects of environmental degradation and to promote\r\nenvironmentally sound and sustainable development in all\r\ncountries.\r\nOnce again Solomon Islands reaffirms its strong\r\ncommitment to sustainable development. We believe that\r\nsound environmental practices constitute an integral part of\r\nthe development process. Thus, all development activities\r\npursued must be both economically and ecologically sound.\r\nThe collective voice of small island developing States is\r\nheard through the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)\r\nwhich share unique circumstances, vulnerabilities and\r\nlimitations. These include their small size and relative\r\ngeographic remoteness, a narrow range of resources, severe\r\npopulation stress, sometimes minimal renewable fresh water\r\nresources, and high degrees of endemism. These pressures\r\nand limitations underscore the need for careful and\r\nsustainable management of resources to sustain future\r\ngenerations. This point was highlighted in our country’s\r\nstatement last year.\r\nSolomon Islands, like its other South Pacific\r\nneighbours, continues to rely heavily, and in some cases\r\ntotally, on the sea, the land, the rivers, the forests and the air\r\naround us for its livelihood and survival. Solomon Islands\r\ntherefore attaches great importance to environmental issues\r\nand accords high priority to collective efforts in the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\r\nfollow-up activities and the implementation of Agenda 21,\r\nincluding other, associated principles and conventions.\r\nSolomon Islands is a party to the Port Vila Declaration on\r\nPopulation and Sustainable Development. We therefore\r\ncontinue to support preparations for the forthcoming two\r\nmajor Conferences in 1994 - the Barbados Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States and the Cairo World Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development.\r\nSolomon Islands is one of the few countries in the\r\nSouth Pacific that now has a national environment\r\nmanagement strategy endorsed by the Government. That\r\nstrategy is now in the implementation phase, in which\r\npriority areas for action at the national level have been\r\nidentified.\r\nHuman-induced climate change and its subsequent\r\neffect of sea-level rise is perhaps the most intractable threat\r\nto human well-being and the survival of many species on\r\nEarth. The South Pacific is no exception. Solomon Islands\r\nis a signatory of the Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange and will soon complete the necessary requirements\r\nfor its ratification. The formalities for the ratification of the\r\nMontreal Protocol are under way. We warmly welcome the\r\nspeedy action of the United Nations in establishing a\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development and, in particular,\r\nwe welcome the acceptance of the South Pacific Forum\r\nsecretariat as a special representative to the Commission and\r\nthe South Pacific Regional Environment Programme\r\n(SPREP) as an observer in the Commission.\r\nSolomon Islands applauds the initiative taken by the\r\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea in putting forward,\r\nthrough the United Nations system, the agenda item on\r\nopportunity and participation. The adverse economic\r\nchanges in recent years have created difficult circumstances\r\nfor many small countries. There is a need to identify\r\noptions in order to make possible participation by\r\nGovernments and peoples of developing countries on an\r\nequal footing. Solomon Islands welcomes the proposal in\r\nthe Papua New Guinea initiative for the establishment of a\r\npanel of experts to study and recommend ways of increasing\r\nopportunity and participation for developing countries.\r\nSpeaking about Papua New Guinea, I should like to\r\nconvey Solomon Islands’ profound appreciation to the\r\nUnited Nations for the goodwill mission it sent last year to\r\ndiscuss the problems we had encountered at the border\r\nbetween Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. I am\r\nhappy to report that the new Solomon Islands Government,\r\nthrough its six-point initiative, is working constructively with\r\nits neighbour, Papua New Guinea, to find a lasting peaceful\r\nsolution to the problems at our border.\r\nProper management and good fishing practices are\r\nessential for the sustainable use of marine living resources.\r\nThe major income earner of Solomon Islands is fisheries.\r\nSolomon Islands supports the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea. Preparations for its ratification are\r\nbeing considered. The Solomon Islands Government\r\nstrongly supports the work of the Forum Fisheries Agency\r\n(FFA) and appeals to distant-water fishing nations to\r\ncooperate with the management and conservation measures\r\nstipulated by that Agency.\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe new Government of Solomon Islands has just\r\nofficially launched its blueprint document entitled,\r\n\"Statement of Policies\". The Government’s philosophy of\r\nwhere and how to steer the country over the next four years\r\nis laid out in this document. The Government is embarking\r\non a major programme of economic and social reforms\r\naimed at attaining sustainable development. The ministries\r\nresponsible are currently discussing and putting together a\r\nprogramme of structural adjustment. The programme\r\nemphasizes the sustainable management of natural resources,\r\npublic-sector reforms and the promotion of private-sector\r\ndevelopment. It devotes particular attention to the sizes and\r\ncosts of institutions, and outlines proposals for the\r\nredeployment of resources to areas of production and need.\r\nThe preparation of this programme is expected to be\r\ncompleted by November 1993.\r\nWhile this exercise is considered to be a long-term\r\nviable undertaking, it is necessary to seek external\r\nassistance. The Government of Solomon Islands is fully\r\ncommitted to this long-overdue reform, but appeals to\r\ninternational financial institutions and donors to provide\r\nfinancial assistance and advice.\r\nOn human rights, the Solomon Islands Government\r\nfully supports the Vienna Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction which were the outcome of the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights held from 14 to 25 June 1993. Fundamental\r\nrights and freedoms of the individual are listed in chapter II,\r\nsections 3 to 19 of our national Constitution. We condemn\r\nany violation of human rights anywhere in the world. We\r\nalso join the rest of the world in the promotion of human\r\nrights and support those who have spoken in favour of the\r\nestablishment of a post of high commissioner for human\r\nrights. Such a post would indeed be a worthwhile\r\ninvestment.\r\nSolomon Islands also salutes the work and courage of\r\nthose countries that contribute troops and humanitarian\r\nassistance to trouble-spots all over the world. We pray for\r\nthe souls of those who have died in the field. We strongly\r\ndeplore the actions of those who have committed atrocities\r\nagainst peace-keepers, Red Cross workers and associated\r\npersonnel. Solomon Islands therefore strongly supports New\r\nZealand’s initiative in requesting the inscription on the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s agenda of the critical item on the safety\r\nof personnel in United Nations peace-keeping operations.\r\nThe United Nations Charter has now been physically\r\nreduced to a pocket-sized booklet, but the demands the\r\nnations of the world place on this global Organization\r\noutstrip the limits of its capabilities and the resources at its\r\ndisposal. Perhaps this is a positive sign - a justification of\r\nthe need for its continuing existence.\r\nA few more flags have been added at the United\r\nNations this year. We warmly welcome the new Members\r\nof the United Nations family and congratulate their\r\nGovernments and peoples on taking this courageous step.\r\nIn 1945 the founders of the United Nations saw the\r\nneed to set up this body. Today, we are challenged in no\r\nuncertain terms to ensure that the work that was begun 48\r\nyears ago continues, to keep the Organization alive, relevant,\r\nmeaningful and cost effective. It is the only hope for world\r\npeace and security and for the promotion of democracy,\r\ndevelopment and global-resource management. Member\r\nStates request the Organization to be accountable, and so we\r\nMember States too must return to it our individual due\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nMay the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations bring\r\na new dawn to human relations between all peoples around\r\nthe world.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. GIRIJA PRASAD KOIRALA,\r\nPRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER FOR FOREIGN\r\nAFFAIRS OF THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Nepal.\r\nMr. Girija Prasad Koirala, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Nepal, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nKingdom of Nepal, His Excellency The Right\r\nHonourable Girija Prasad Koirala, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. KOIRALA (Nepal): I have the honour to convey\r\nto the General Assembly greetings from the people and\r\nGovernment of Nepal and the best wishes of His Majesty\r\nKing Birenda Bir Bikram Shah Dev for the success of its\r\nforty-eighth session.\r\nAs I stand before members today, my thoughts go back\r\nto 1960, when the first elected Prime Minister of Nepal, the\r\nlate B.P. Koirala, addressed the Assembly and declared that\r\nthe foreign policy of Nepal was inspired by the purposes and\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 11\r\nprinciples of the United Nations. He said then that Nepal\r\nlooked upon the Organization as an instrument for promoting\r\npeace and justice among nations.\r\nThe late Prime Minister’s visit to the United Nations\r\nwas an event of historic significance for Nepal. A\r\nrevolutionary transformation had then taken place in my\r\ncountry. As a result, a conscious and coherent foreign\r\npolicy, with centrality given to the principles of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, had started to take shape.\r\nSimilar revolutionary changes again took place in my\r\ncountry in 1990, after a gap of more than three decades. In\r\naccordance with the wishes of our people, multiparty\r\ndemocracy has been restored in Nepal. Now there is a\r\nconstitutional guarantee of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms. As the second elected Prime Minister to address\r\nthis body, after 33 years, I must say that this moment has a\r\ndeep personal overtone for me.\r\nRestoration of multiparty democracy and respect for\r\nfundamental human rights does not necessarily mean that we\r\nhave solved all our problems. The expectations of the\r\npeople are naturally high, but the means at our disposal are\r\nextremely limited.\r\nFaced with such problems, my Government has been\r\nmaking every effort to ensure a better standard of living for\r\nour people in larger freedom. Our development plans are\r\nbased on the premise that it is the individual citizen and not\r\nthe State which has the right to development. Along with\r\neconomic liberalization, we are pursuing a people-oriented\r\ndevelopment policy focused on poverty alleviation. To\r\nachieve our goals we have increased investments in human-\r\npriority areas. Given the enormous constraints upon us,\r\nranging from lack of resources to the high cost of\r\ninfrastructure, a shortage of skilled personnel and\r\ninstitutional deficiencies, our problems are daunting. We\r\nlook forward to greater understanding from donor countries\r\nand multilateral agencies in helping us to implement our\r\npeople-oriented development programmes, in upgrading local\r\nskills and in building the capacity to accelerate human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe foreign policy of Nepal is guided by the objective\r\nof ensuring its sovereignty, political independence and\r\nnational security while promoting international peace and\r\ncooperation. Inspired by the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations, the policy of non-alignment, and respect for\r\nhuman rights, we seek friendship and cooperation with all\r\ncountries of the world, and in particular with our neighbours.\r\nWe have reason to be satisfied with the excellent relations\r\nwe enjoy with the countries in our immediate\r\nneighbourhood. We are partners with our friends in South\r\nAsia in an effort to forge a mutually beneficial scheme of\r\ncooperation for the welfare of our people under the aegis of\r\nthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.\r\nWith the sudden end of the cold war the world is at the\r\nthreshold of a new era of shared responsibility for global\r\npeace and development. The post-cold-war world is very\r\nmuch in need of order, but it is a world that cannot be\r\nordered by military and economic Powers alone. At this\r\ntime of historic transition, political leadership in all countries\r\nmust show a higher order of statesmanship. It is time to\r\nshed old prejudices and parochialism. We should be able to\r\npool the best of every civilization and culture for the greater\r\ngood of mankind.\r\nChanges in international relations have also created\r\nopportunities to devise new partnership in global\r\nresponsibility. The world today is poised to consider new\r\napproaches to international law based not on unilateralism\r\nbut on multilateralism. The United Nations is an\r\norganization of the powerful and the weak, the large and the\r\nsmall, the wealthy and the poor, each contributing its share\r\nto the common interest. It is in the interest of all to make\r\nthe United Nations an effective and influential agent of\r\nconstructive change in a turbulent world.\r\nIf the United Nations is to fulfil its Charter obligations\r\nit must deal with the root causes of conflicts and instability.\r\nThe mechanisms and processes at its disposal for achieving\r\nthat goal must be strengthened and refined. In this context,\r\nthere are four areas which demand immediate attention:\r\nfirst, international cooperation to combat poverty; secondly,\r\nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security; thirdly,\r\nprogressive reduction and finally elimination of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and, fourthly, universalization of human\r\nrights.\r\nDemocracy and human rights are easily eroded when\r\nwidespread poverty prevails. Poverty undermines human\r\ndignity, contributes to environmental degradation and\r\nundermines the cohesion of a society. It also poses a lasting\r\nthreat to peace and stability. The search for collective\r\nsecurity cannot, therefore, be separated from the sustained\r\nefforts to improve the economic and social conditions of\r\npeoples everywhere. Agenda 21, adopted at the Rio\r\nConference on Environment and Development, is a\r\ncomprehensive blueprint for sustainable development. To\r\nturn that vision into reality there is an urgent need for\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nresumption of the North-South dialogue and for economic\r\ncooperation between developing nations.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIn this context, I look forward to the\r\nSecretary-General’s agenda for development. We sincerely\r\nhope that an agenda for development will form the basis of\r\naccelerating international cooperation to the mutual benefit\r\nof developed and developing countries alike. The upcoming\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development and the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women should also be occasions to\r\nfocus on the human dimensions of socio-economic problems.\r\nIn speaking of social and economic issues, I recall the\r\ninitiative taken by countries of South Asia under the aegis of\r\nthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to\r\nwork together for the cause of children. That initiative\r\nprovided the major motivation for the holding of the World\r\nSummit for Children. The mid-decade review in 1995 must\r\nbe an occasion to evaluate the implementation of the\r\npromises the international community made to children at\r\nthe World Summit. Despite conflicting demands on our\r\nlimited resources, we in Nepal are allocating an increasing\r\nportion of our national budget to child and maternal health\r\nand welfare and on other basic human-services areas. We\r\nare in favour of the proposal for matching resource\r\nallocations by donor countries for such national initiatives.\r\nThe dramatic increase in the demands on and\r\nheightened expectations of the United Nations is nowhere\r\nmore compelling than in the area of peace and security.\r\nWith experience spanning over 35 years in United Nations\r\nmissions, Nepal welcomes the expansion in the mandates of\r\npeace-keeping operations. The recent successes of the\r\nmissions in El Salvador and Cambodia are testimony to the\r\npotential of a United Nations operation with a clearly\r\ndefined and practicable mandate. The joint venture of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of American States in\r\nHaiti is breaking newer ground in international cooperation\r\nto restore a democratically elected Government and to\r\nprotect and promote human rights.\r\nWithout minimizing the enormity of the problems the\r\nUnited Nations has to take into account in Somalia, I feel\r\nthat the emphasis on military action will overshadow the\r\nlarger goal of the mission in that country. I urge the\r\nredoubling of efforts to seek lasting political solutions to the\r\nproblems in Somalia.\r\nI appeal to the parties concerned in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to respond immediately to the successive\r\nresolutions of the Security Council and halt the senseless\r\ncarnage of innocent people. The continuing tragedy in the\r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia presents a test-case for\r\nviable cooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations in the maintenance of peace and security.\r\nNepal will continue to support the further development\r\nof preventive diplomacy by the Secretary-General and the\r\nSecurity Council. In the maintenance of peace and security,\r\nthe implementation of enforcement measures under the\r\nCharter should be the step of last resort. It should be the\r\nexception to rather than the rule of the game. The real\r\nstrength of collective security lies in the ability to implement\r\nthe provisions of the Charter relating to peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes.\r\nThe grounds for the intervention of the Security\r\nCouncil have also raised questions of consistency. As the\r\nprincipal organ entrusted with the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the Council must act in an\r\neven-handed and impartial manner and must be perceived as\r\ndoing so.\r\nThe recent comments of the Secretary-General on the\r\nfinancial situation of the Organization should be a cause of\r\nconcern to all. Investments in peace-keeping, peacemaking\r\nand preventive diplomacy are investments in collective\r\nstability. It is not possible for the United Nations to play its\r\nrole without adequate resources.\r\nAlong with other non-aligned countries, Nepal has\r\nalways subscribed to the call for a more active United\r\nNations role in arms control and disarmament. Since mutual\r\nfear is the source of any arms race, confidence-building\r\nmeasures must be seriously pursued in order to achieve the\r\ngoals of disarmament. Nations should pursue a culture of\r\nensuring security at the lowest possible level of armaments.\r\nSuccesses in bilateral negotiations on nuclear weapons,\r\nconventional forces in Europe and chemical weapons prove\r\nthat it is a feasible goal.\r\nNepal deems it extremely significant that all five\r\nnuclear-weapon States are now parties to the nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty. We have long advocated an early\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Meaningful\r\nprogress in this area will have important implications for the\r\nreview and extension Conference on the non-proliferation\r\nTreaty.\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 13\r\nProtection of human rights has emerged as an important\r\nfactor in the development of friendly relations among States.\r\nThe United Nations must spare no effort in establishing an\r\ninternational norm of human rights. The World Conference\r\non Human Rights was a major step in this direction. Human\r\nrights cannot be secure without a universal conscience on the\r\npart of all peoples to uphold each other’s rights in full\r\nunderstanding of the just demands of the individual, the\r\ncommunity, the State and the international order. Human\r\nrights cannot be secured unless there is an absolute freedom\r\nfrom fear from any source. There is a direct correlation\r\nbetween the status of human rights, the democratic process\r\nand an evolution of a culture of peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes. The threat to peace is the greatest when human\r\nrights are denied.\r\nThe world is at a vital turning-point. The old order has\r\ncome to an end while the new has yet to take shape. While\r\nsome old contradictions persist and new ones appear, some\r\nunexpected bright areas have also dawned. Nepal welcomes\r\nthe agreement reached by the negotiating parties in South\r\nAfrica to hold an election in April 1994. We share the deep\r\nconcern of the international community over the continued\r\nviolence which threatens the peaceful transition of South\r\nAfrica to a non-racial democratic society.\r\nNepal has long enjoyed friendship with both the Israeli\r\nand the Palestinian peoples. We welcome the Declaration of\r\nPrinciples as well as the exchange of letters of mutual\r\nrecognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO). The statesmanship shown by the\r\nleaders of Israel and the PLO promises a new beginning for\r\nthe Middle East and, indeed, the world. We earnestly hope\r\nthat this historic breakthrough will facilitate the search for a\r\ncomprehensive and lasting solution of the Middle East\r\nproblem.\r\nAs I come towards the end of my statement, I wish to\r\nextend to you, Sir, my hearty congratulations on your\r\nelection to the high office of President of the General\r\nAssembly at a time when the United Nations is passing\r\nthrough a very important phase in its history. I also take\r\nthis opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev for his stewardship of the forty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI must also take this opportunity to pay our warmest\r\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\r\nHis efforts to reform and strengthen the United Nations with\r\nthe courage of conviction have been universally appreciated.\r\nWe are impressed by his vision and dynamism, which are\r\nnecessary for the United Nations to cope with the new\r\nrealities and challenges of our time. Mr. Boutros-Ghali was\r\na well-known figure in my country even before he became\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations. We consider\r\nhim to be a sincere friend of Nepal.\r\nAlthough small in military and economic strength,\r\nNepal is fully alive to its responsibilities as a Member of\r\nthis world Organization. Nepal will not hesitate to take an\r\nindependent and objective stand in favour of larger good and\r\njustice. For us, the Charter of the United Nations captures\r\nthe highest ideals of mankind. I take this opportunity to\r\nrededicate the commitment of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Nepal to the United Nations.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Nepal for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Girija Prasad Koirala, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Nepal, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. Barrow (Belize): The delegation of Belize takes\r\nimmense pride, Sir, in your election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. This is the\r\nfirst time in the history of the Organization that a\r\nCommonwealth Caribbean national has been chosen to\r\nsuperintend the deliberations of the General Assembly. Your\r\nelection is, thus, not only the highest tribute that could have\r\nbeen paid you, but is also the accomplishment of your\r\ncountry, Guyana, and of the wider Commonwealth\r\nCaribbean. As a part of the latter, Belize may be forgiven\r\nfor any note of self-congratulation that creeps into the\r\nencomiums we heap upon you today.\r\nIn that regard - and we say this only slightly with\r\ntongue in cheek - we note that almost your first act of\r\nwisdom upon assuming office was the selection of a very\r\nexcellent Belizean as presidential spokesperson.\r\nLet me at this time also record my delegation’s\r\nappreciation of the most able manner in which the outgoing\r\nPresident, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, conducted the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session.\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn addition, may I take the opportunity to welcome\r\nformally to the United Nations family the six countries - the\r\nCzech Republic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Slovak Republic, The\r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Andorra -\r\nwhich have joined the Organization this year.\r\nAllow me also to offer, on behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Belize, our deep sympathy to the people and\r\nthe Government of India for the heavy death toll and\r\nconsiderable material loss caused by the devastating\r\nearthquake on 30 September.\r\nOver the five years since I last appeared in this Hall,\r\nmany things have changed in the world. In Belize we, too,\r\nhave experienced change. On 30 June 1993 the people of\r\nBelize voted, through peaceful elections, for a new\r\ngovernment. Once more we have demonstrated the stability\r\nof our democratic institutions and the maturity of our polity.\r\nIn an age when the so-called global trend towards\r\ndemocratization seems at times to be a process that moves\r\none step forward and two steps back, we in Belize are justly\r\nproud of our record.\r\nIn these five years, some of the changes occurring in\r\nthe global prospect have been favourable, and many of these\r\nare attributable to this Organization, which, under its\r\ndistinguished Secretary-General, has been striving to fulfil\r\nthe mandate of its Charter and find ways and means to cope\r\nwith problems not necessarily envisaged by the framers of\r\nthat Charter.\r\nIn the brief tour d’horizon of the international scene\r\nwhich I shall undertake today, the first matter I wish to\r\naddress is peace and security. We are very gratified by the\r\npositive developments that have occurred in several places.\r\nUppermost in our minds is our own subregion of Central\r\nAmerica. There we have been heartened by the movement\r\nof several of our neighbours towards reconciliation and\r\nsocial justice.\r\nIn particular, we note with satisfaction that the brief\r\nhiccup of the events in the Republic of Guatemala in May\r\nand June does not appear to have seriously flawed that\r\ncountry’s efforts at permanent redemocratization. We are\r\nhappy that the new government there has publicly confirmed\r\nGuatemala’s recognition of sovereign and independent\r\nBelize. Diplomatic relations between our two countries can\r\nonce again proceed apace; and we shall continue the work\r\nfor the preservation of bilateral and regional security and the\r\nsearch for a lasting solution to the issues that still bedevil us.\r\nIn accordance with the principles enunciated by this\r\nOrganization, such a solution must be on the basis of mutual\r\nrespect for peace, for the rights of both countries to\r\nself-determination and for the integrity of each other’s land\r\nand sea territory.\r\nIn the Caribbean we have hopes that the long-suffering\r\npeople of Haiti will be rewarded by the return of its\r\nlegitimate government.\r\nRecent developments in South Africa are clearly very\r\nencouraging, and we are confident of the success of the\r\ntransition to majority rule, which will be heralded by the\r\nnon-racial elections scheduled for April 1994.\r\nThen, in the midst of continued strife in the Middle\r\nEast, we believe we see positive signs of the way forward\r\nwith the dramatic opening between the people of Palestine\r\nand the State of Israel. At long last there seems a real\r\npossibility of the Palestinian people’s right to self-\r\ndetermination coexisting with the State of Israel’s right to\r\nsafe and secure borders.\r\nWe welcome the finalization of the demarcation of the\r\nboundary between Kuwait and Iraq, which was accomplished\r\nby the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission on\r\n20 May 1993. We also welcome the adoption by the\r\nSecurity Council of resolution 833 (1993), in which it\r\nguaranteed the inviolability of the boundary between the two\r\nStates.\r\nEncouraging, too, has been the consolidation of the\r\nbroad consultative mechanisms for confidence-building,\r\nsecurity, human rights and cooperation originally established\r\nfor Europe in the Helsinki Conference and now substantially\r\nexpanded. Such structures have considerable value, and we\r\nunderstand that our colleagues in the countries members of\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are\r\nin the process of developing a similar mechanism with a\r\ndistinct ASEAN character. Above all, we commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his vision in \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nDespite all these promising developments, however, the\r\noverall outlook for world security remains bleak. In far too\r\nmany places the peace is disrupted by fratricidal struggle.\r\nEverywhere the crushing burden of armaments - to employ\r\na famous expression used by President Roosevelt and\r\nWinston Churchill in 1941 - bids to drive our planet off its\r\nestablished course. The Second World War was partly\r\nfought, and this great Organization was largely established,\r\nto eradicate programmes of ethnic genocide. Now, nearly\r\n50 years after the birth of the United Nations, we are\r\nexperiencing several such programmes on a massive scale.\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 15\r\nI urge that during this session we take the first major\r\nstep to right these imbalances, which affect global peace and\r\nsecurity. Just as the Helsinki model is one way forward, we\r\nhope that another is the International Tribunal on war\r\ncrimes, the judges of which this Assembly recently elected.\r\nAmong other steps which might be taken are the\r\nfollowing: Governments must forswear profiteering from\r\nthe sale or sponsorship of the sale of armaments. There\r\nmust be an expansion of regional and subregional systems of\r\ncooperation and coordination in the cognate areas of\r\nsecurity, narcotics interdiction and counter-terrorism. This\r\nbody must make firm recommendations for the development\r\nand rigid enforcement of domestic neutrality laws\r\neverywhere. Likewise, the international law relating to\r\nneutrality must be thoroughly modernized to proscribe and\r\nseverely punish trafficking in arms. This must be not only\r\nin situations of belligerency, but also in cases of insurgency,\r\nrebellion and other armed conflict, both internal and\r\ninternational. The recent salutary reinvigoration of this\r\nOrganization’s peace-keeping mechanisms must be furthered.\r\nThis is a time when the United Nations is increasingly\r\nbeing called upon to act as a peacemaker in troubled and\r\nturbulent regions of the world. It is to the Organization’s\r\ncredit that it has risen to the occasion by undertaking\r\ncomplex and challenqinq assignments around the globe.\r\nThere was a time when United Nations peace-keeping\r\nforces could successfully be composed of contingents from\r\nthe so-called third world countries. But recent experience\r\nhas now shown that large and difficult operations of the\r\nBosnia and Somalia type stand little chance of success\r\nwithout the active participation of major Powers. In this\r\ncontext, we welcome President Clinton’s speech in this\r\nsession of the Assembly, offering to commit United States\r\ntroops to the United Nations Bosnia operation under certain\r\nconditions.\r\nYet there is still a role for small States. And we in\r\nBelize would be prepared to offer training facilities to the\r\nOrganization as a contribution to increasing the efficiency of\r\npeace-keeping forces. This would be in accordance with\r\nArticle 43 of the Charter, which calls for member\r\nGovernments to make available to the Security Council\r\n\"assistance and facilities ... necessary for the purpose of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security\". Needless to\r\nsay, we would be happy to make our contribution in concert\r\nwith other countries in our area. Either pre-existing regional\r\nsecurity mechanisms and/or new bilateral and multilateral\r\narrangements might serve as the vehicle for small country\r\nefforts at cooperation.\r\nAs a backdrop to all this, the provisions of the Charter\r\nrelative to peacemaking must be strengthened. In particular,\r\na standing United Nations force under unified United\r\nNations command should be considered and the Military\r\nStaff Committee must be made fully operational. In keeping\r\nwith the Secretary-General’s quest to improve efficiencies,\r\nstrict military discipline of United Nations forces must be\r\nestablished and there must be improved coordination at\r\nHeadquarters and in the field.\r\nThe most important of the steps which my Government\r\nbelieves should be taken is reform of the Security Council.\r\nIt is self-evident that in these times of turmoil and increased\r\nUnited Nations activity the agenda item of equitable\r\nrepresentation on, and increase in membership of, the\r\nCouncil looms large. Belize has recently submitted a paper\r\nto the Secretary-General, detailing our ideas on this\r\nall-important topic.\r\nI wish to turn next to international cooperation. I\r\nbelieve that there exists an international legal obligation to\r\ncooperate in good faith. It is anticipated in the Articles on\r\nprinciples and purposes and other provisions of the United\r\nNations Charter, and is reiterated in such Declarations as the\r\nfriendly relations Declaration of 1970 and the 1974 Charter\r\nof Economic Rights and Duties of States. I will address the\r\nquestion of economic cooperation at a later stage in my\r\nremarks. At this point, I wish to train the spotlight on\r\ncooperation in the area of ecospheric concerns.\r\nAs regards the ecosphere, Belize considers that the\r\nearly and universal ratification of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea is of paramount\r\nimportance. It will be recalled that the Convention imposes\r\nmyriad duties of cooperation. In that way, the weak, and not\r\nonly the strong and mighty, will inherit the Earth and its\r\nwaters.\r\nWe have seen two recent examples of successful efforts\r\nat cooperation in the ecosphere. The first involves the ozone\r\nlayer. In that connection, intensive cooperation by\r\nGovernments and by private industry, pursuant to the\r\nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone\r\nLayer, as amended, has led to a significant decline in the\r\nrate of expansion of the hole in the ozone layer.\r\nMy other example is the cooperation of foreign and\r\ndomestic agencies with the Governments of my country,\r\nBelize and Costa Rica, which has contributed to substantial\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsuccess in our conservation efforts. Cognizant of these\r\nsuccesses, we appeal for intensive cooperation in all aspects\r\nof the ecosphere, including the termination of ocean and\r\nterrestrial dumping, the halt of desertification and the\r\nreduction of the causes of global warming. We also hope for\r\na concrete programme of action at next April’s Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States to be held in Barbados.\r\nOne area in which we must redouble our efforts at\r\ncooperation is the moral environment. In numerous Member\r\ncountries the people have clamoured for cessation of corrupt\r\npractices in government and business, both national and\r\ninternational. Now, we are extremely happy to observe that\r\nthe Secretary-General has established the new post of\r\nAssistant Secretary-General for Inspections and\r\nInvestigations. In so doing, he has made it clear that the\r\nmoral environment of our organization must be sanitized.\r\nWe must support him in this endeavour. At the same time,\r\nwe lend our voice to those who call for the accountability of\r\nall inter-governmental organizations to independent auditors\r\nand inspectors.\r\nMy Government attaches the greatest importance to\r\nintegrity and decency in public life. We applaud such\r\ninternational efforts as the forthcoming anti-corruption\r\nconference to be held in Mexico later this year to plan\r\nnational strategies for fighting corruption. And we in Belize\r\nhave recently taken our own action to strengthen the legal\r\ninfrastructure necessary to banish the scourge of political\r\ncorruption. In just three months since taking office, we have\r\nintroduced four major pieces of legislation in our Parliament.\r\nThey are the Prevention of Corruption in Public Life Bill,\r\nthe Ombudsman Bill, the Contractor General Bill and the\r\nFreedom of Information Bill. This last, as far as we can\r\ndetermine, is the only one of its kind in the entire\r\nCommonwealth Carribean. These measures bear testimony\r\nto my Government’s determination to wage a total war on\r\ncorruption and to make Belize the model of a just, honest\r\nand democratic society.\r\nI turn next to issues relating to international\r\ndevelopment and economic relations. For over 30 years, the\r\nOrganization has painstakingly sought to spell out that the\r\nright to development and the duty of the privileged to assist\r\nthe underprivileged are firmly based in international law and\r\npublic policies. This right and duty were part of the\r\n\"freedom from want\" principle, one of the founding\r\nprinciples of the 1942 wartime coalition that was the first to\r\nbe called the \"United Nations\". Freedom from want had\r\nnothing to do with ideology and great-Power rivalry.\r\nNevertheless, there have been dramatic ideological,\r\ngeopolitical and economic changes during the late 1980s. As\r\nthese changes have occurred, needs have increased but\r\nresources have not. Yet we have heard rumours that various\r\ninitiatives to bring economic justice to this planet are no\r\nlonger necessary.\r\nI respectfully suggest that nothing could be further from\r\nthe truth. In fact, such controversial movements as the one\r\nto establish a new international economic order were merely,\r\nas we have intimated, the reiteration of an established\r\nprinciple. That is, those initiatives were the renewal of an\r\norder, not a new order. Furthermore, in the original Somalia\r\nintervention, we see strong confirmation of the continuing\r\nvitality of the principle of \"freedom from want\" - for all of\r\nus will remember that the avowed objective of the current\r\nexercises in that beleaguered country was to bring food,\r\ncomfort and succour to its suffering people.\r\nThus, I believe, we are seeing the reaffirmation of\r\nfreedom from want as a human right. At the same time, I\r\nwould urge the Assembly to take firm steps to ensure that\r\nfood no longer be used as a weapon by parties to civil and\r\ninternational conflicts.\r\nIn all this we are acutely aware of the shift in world\r\ntrading patterns brought on by the formation of new trading\r\nblocs. The most recent and prominent of these are of course\r\nthe North American Free Trade Agreement among Mexico,\r\nthe United States of America and Canada, and the Single\r\nEuropean Market. And so, in some areas at least, the march\r\ntowards wider trade liberalization and true market economy\r\nmoves inexorably forward. But we in the South also see that\r\nour economies and life as we know them are threatened by\r\nthese developments; our preferential access to markets\r\nsteadily erodes and our terms of trade consistently worsen.\r\nWhat we are in fact concerned about here is the\r\npressure to open up our borders prematurely to the free flow\r\nof agricultural and other products from the more developed\r\ncountries. It is a bitter pill to swallow, even as we watch\r\nthe protectionist squabbling among developed countries that\r\nhas prevented the successful conclusion of the Uruguay\r\nRound of Multilateral trade negotiations under the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Of course, it\r\nwould also result in massive economic dislocation followed\r\ninevitably by social and political unrest in our countries.\r\nNevertheless, we acknowledge that we must in the long\r\nrun identify alternative commodities that we can produce\r\nefficiently and with comparative advantage. I must stress,\r\nhowever, that we are hard pressed to find the resources\r\nrequired for comprehensive research, development and\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 17\r\npromotion programmes for new products. We must be\r\nafforded an adequate transition period to adjust our\r\neconomic and production activities. I would wish, therefore,\r\nto take this opportunity to call on the countries members of\r\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment to identify and dedicate significant financial\r\nand technical resources to assist small countries in\r\ndeveloping alternative products. Of course, current trends in\r\nofficial and private financial flows to the developing world\r\nsuggest that this is a cry that will fall largely on deaf ears.\r\nOn a more positive note, permit me at this juncture to\r\napplaud the apparent resolve of the United Nations organs\r\nfor development assistance to improve their efforts at\r\ncoordination. In this connection, I single out for special\r\nmention the Secretary- General’s ongoing formulation of an\r\nagenda for development and the determined spirit of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to\r\nstrengthen its mission and revamp its machinery. This,\r\nhowever, is but a beginning of what must be a crusade for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe last set of issues I shall address are social, political,\r\ncultural and humanitarian. First, we must do much more to\r\nensure that women are accorded their proper rights in the\r\ndomestic and international orders. No longer should we\r\nmerely echo the litany that women’s development is\r\nindispensable for economic development. We must ensure\r\nthat women are accorded equal rights in all spheres.\r\nFurthermore, they must urgently be given equal\r\nrepresentation in our political, social, cultural and other\r\ninstitutions. Again, I take note of the recent efforts of this\r\nOrganization to improve the position of women in the upper\r\nechelons of the United Nations Secretariat.\r\nAs regards refugees, it would be disingenuous to call\r\nfor their enhanced protection without acknowledging the\r\nsevere problems which host countries increasingly face. For\r\ninstance, we in Belize do the best we can, but overcrowding\r\na slender raft - even in a relative haven of calm - can bring\r\ndire consequences to all its occupants.\r\nNevertheless, I am happy to report to this Assembly\r\nthat Belize’s record of human rights is good and worthy of\r\nemulation. Our Constitution is founded on the principles of\r\njustice and respect for the fundamental freedoms of all our\r\npeople, and our laws and practices fully conform to the\r\nmandate of our Constitution.\r\nThe international scourge of narcotics continues\r\nunabated. Again, we add our voices to those who urge that\r\nat least the same degree of attention be given to curbing\r\ndemand and improving public health, as to addressing\r\nsupply. Narcotics, terrorism and urban violence are all gross\r\nmanifestations of an awful cancer seeking to engulf our\r\nplanet. One clear contributor to this is the mass and\r\nuniversal culture, or what passes for culture, purveyed by the\r\nmoguls of television. While we welcome the utility of the\r\nnew global news channels, we lament the other, baneful,\r\ninfluences to which our people are subjected by some\r\naspects of worldwide programming. It is high time that this\r\nOrganization tackle this problem.\r\nFinally, as regards human riqhts and humanitarian law,\r\neven over the brief period of five years since I last addressed\r\nthis body, we have witnessed significant expansion in the\r\nactivities of the Commission on Human Rights and the\r\nbodies established under the various United Nations\r\ninstruments for the protection of fundamental rights and\r\nfreedoms. We have seen this Organization, on invitation,\r\nparticipate in monitoring and conducting elections and, in the\r\nunprecedented case of Cambodia, actually administer a\r\ncountry prior to the holding of democratic elections. Yet the\r\nbasic rights of human beings in numerous places are still\r\nseriously impaired. Many of those who should protect, in\r\nfact violate. And conferences, tribunals and conventions\r\nbring scarce relief.\r\nIn the realm of humanitarian law, we are hopeful that\r\nthe International Tribunal on war crimes will set a healthy\r\nprecedent. Nevertheless, we view with increasing concern\r\nthe flouting of the Geneva regime, especially the 1977\r\nProtocols applicable to various forms of civil strife. That\r\nregime is the other side of the coin of human rights.\r\nWhichever side comes up when that coin is tossed, it comes\r\nup tarnished.\r\nClearly, despite a somewhat mixed record, the United\r\nNations is no moribund organization. Nevertheless, as it\r\nnears its golden jubilee, it does require additional impetus,\r\na more focused consensus for reform and revitalization. Let\r\nall of us, then, as we go about the business of this forty-\r\neighth session, bear well in mind the words of the Preamble\r\nto the Charter and accordingly pledge our rededication to the\r\ntask of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar, reaffirming faith in fundamental human rights and\r\nequality, and creating the moral climate in which justice and\r\ninternational law will finally prevail.\r\nMr. ALLAGANY (Saudi Arabia) (interpretation from\r\nArabic):\r\nIt is with pleasure that I convey to Your Excellency at the\r\noutset of my statement, our sincerest congratulations on your\r\nelection to the Presidency of the forty-eighth session of the\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. Your election\r\nreflects appreciation for you personally, as well as for the\r\npositive role played by your country in the international\r\narena. I wish you every success in the pursuit of your\r\nmission.\r\nOn this occasion, I also wish to congratulate your\r\npredecessor for his effective guidance of the affairs of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its previous session.\r\nI also wish to acknowledge the sincere efforts\r\nconstantly exerted by the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to enhance the\r\nprospects for peace and reduce the elements of tension\r\nwhich prevail in many parts of the world.\r\nI am also pleased to welcome, on behalf of the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, all the States that have joined our\r\nOrganization to participate, along with all other Member\r\nStates, in realizing the noble objectives towards which we all\r\nstrive.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly takes place\r\namidst important developments in the international arena that\r\nrequire us to strive to conclude our work with successful\r\nresolutions on the problems and crises we face. These\r\nresolutions must be within the context of our efforts to\r\nbenefit from the opportunities provided by the emergence of\r\nwhat has come to be known as the new international order.\r\nWe have all contributed, through the United Nations to\r\nestablishing the new international order, the foundations of\r\nwhich are based on the principles enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter and inherent in international law. This new\r\norder respects the sovereignty and independence of States\r\nand guarantees the inviolability of their international borders.\r\nIt guarantees the territorial integrity of States and rejects\r\ninterference in their domestic affairs. It is based on equity\r\namong nations, small and large, rich and poor, and its goal\r\nis to replace war and destruction with cooperation between\r\nnations and peoples. The new international order strives for\r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflict and rejects the use of\r\nforce or coercion. It operates to preserve the dignity of man\r\nand to spread security, stability, prosperity and development\r\nto all corners of our world.\r\nThe emergence of this new order has been a source of\r\nhope and optimism for the international community,\r\nparticularly when serious and constructive international\r\ncooperation succeeded in confronting the Iraqi aggression\r\nagainst the State of Kuwait. Today, however, we are\r\nsaddened and pained by the inability of this order to confront\r\nthe aggression committed against the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, a State Member of our international\r\nOrganization. This crisis, if not resolved in a manner\r\ncompatible with the principles of the new world order, will\r\ncause this new order to lose its credibility and effectiveness.\r\nWe therefore call for enhancing the role of the United\r\nNations from one of mere crisis management and\r\nmaintenance of peace to one of active and effective\r\npeacemaking.\r\nA general overview of the current international situation\r\nreveals that there remain pockets of tension which threaten\r\nsecurity and stability in many regions of the world. With\r\nthe persistence of such challenges, the role of the United\r\nNations is becoming increasingly important, not only for the\r\nmaintenance of peace, but as an effective means for creating\r\nconditions conducive to peace and stability throughout the\r\nworld. Without a doubt, the creation of such conditions will\r\nbe made much easier if the opportunities for cooperation\r\nbetween nations are increased and support for the United\r\nNations is strengthened so that the Organization may\r\nfunction in a manner that would guarantee that no country\r\ncommits aggression against another or threatens its security,\r\nsovereignty or territorial integrity.\r\nThe honourable role played by the United Nations more\r\nthan three years ago when it stood firmly in the face of\r\nIraq’s aggression against its neighbour Kuwait, and the\r\nresolutions it adopted led in the end to repelling aggression\r\nand restoring legality to Kuwait the peace-loving nation.\r\nThis positive role portrays our expectations of this\r\ninternational body in the present circumstances. We hope\r\nthat it will continue to be played and ask that it be enhanced\r\nby efforts to ensure the complete implementation of all\r\nSecurity Council resolutions regarding the Iraqi regime,\r\nwhich continues to flout international legality. Two years\r\nafter the liberation of Kuwait, the Baghdad regime continues\r\nto resort to threats and false allegations against Kuwait. It\r\ncontinues to delay efforts to implement United Nations\r\nresolutions and rejects all international obligations. We\r\npoint in particular to the Iraqi regime’s objections to the\r\nrecommendations of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait\r\nBoundary Demarcation Commission and its rejection of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 833 (1993), as well as its\r\ncontinued detention of Kuwaiti hostages and prisoners of\r\nwar. This regime has arrogated the right, on the basis of\r\nsovereignty, to starve and abuse its people and subject Iraq\r\nto dangers which threaten its unity and security. It falsely\r\nblames the international community for the dangers and\r\ntragedies to which Iraq and its people have become subject.\r\nThe surest way of facing up to the threats this regime poses\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 19\r\nto the region as a whole, and to the Iraqi people is to fully\r\nand completely implement Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe Declaration of Principles between the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and the Israeli Government, signed\r\nin Washington, D.C. on 13 September 1993, has raised\r\nexpectations and hopes that a just and permanent settlement\r\ncan be found to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which has persisted\r\nfor far too long. This development, though representing\r\nonly an agreement on autonomy in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories, beginning with Gaza and Jericho, nevertheless\r\nrepresents a step towards the establishment of a just,\r\ncomprehensive and permanent peace between the Arab\r\nStates and Israel. A solution to the Palestinian question will\r\nobviously contribute to a just and comprehensive settlement\r\nof the Arab-Israeli conflict as it is the core issue of that\r\nconflict.\r\nThe warm welcome with which the Palestinian-Israeli\r\nagreement was received within Palestinian, Arab and\r\ninternational circles genuinely and clearly reflects the desire\r\nof the Arabs to establish a permanent, just and\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. It also indicates\r\nthe seriousness with which the Arab side has pursued the\r\ncurrent peace process, which was launched in Madrid in\r\nOctober 1991 under the sponsorship of the United States of\r\nAmerica and the Russian Federation.\r\nAs we witness today the optimism generated by the\r\nPalestinian-Israeli agreement, we cannot but feel that it is\r\nincumbent upon the international community to lend support\r\nto the progress that has been achieved in this area by\r\nproviding the necessary economic and developmental\r\nassistance required to build the administrative structures\r\nneeded to make the agreement on self-rule succeed. At the\r\nsame time, it is also incumbent upon us to work diligently\r\nto exploit the momentum generated by this agreement in\r\nfurthering the cause of peace.\r\nThe consolidation of this step requires the achievement\r\nof tangible and positive results in the areas of negotiation\r\nbetween Palestinians and Israelis; at the forefront of those\r\nare the issue of Al-Quds, which is an integral part of the\r\noccupied Arab territories, the issue of the return of\r\nPalestinian refugees, and the settlements built by Israel in the\r\noccupied Arab territories contrary to international law and\r\nthe Geneva Conventions. At the same time, genuine\r\nprogress along all the other bilateral negotiating tracks is\r\nneeded.\r\nThe issue of the occupied Arab Syrian Golan Heights\r\nis clear: it is governed by the principle of respect for\r\ninternational borders. The maintenance of security is not\r\nfeasible, as the realities of contemporary history teach us,\r\nthrough the occupation of territory by force, but rather\r\nthrough the establishment of peace. Thus, peace on this\r\nfront will be achieved only by a complete Israeli withdrawal\r\nfrom the occupied Golan Heights.\r\nLikewise, the Lebanese-Israeli negotiating track is\r\ngoverned by United Nations Security Council resolution\r\n425 (1978), which clearly calls for the immediate,\r\nunconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese\r\nterritory.\r\nI wish to express the appreciation of the Government of\r\nthe Custodian of the two holy mosques to President Clinton\r\nfor his prudent initiative in calling for, and hosting, an\r\ninternational donors’ conference to solicit political and\r\nfinancial support for the Palestinians as they prepare to\r\nassume the responsibilities of self-rule in the occupied\r\nterritories. I also wish to take this opportunity to express\r\nour pleasure at the positive results achieved at that\r\nconference.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given, and continues\r\nto give, its full support in all possible forms to the Middle\r\nEast peace process since it began in Madrid. It has\r\nparticipated effectively in the multilateral talks, and\r\ngenuinely hopes that the process will lead to a just,\r\npermanent and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian\r\nquestion and the Arab conflict with Israel on the basis of\r\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\r\n338 (1973).\r\nDespite the financial burdens the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia bears in building an advanced economy in which the\r\nexpectations of its citizens for a better future are fulfilled,\r\nand despite its current international obligations at a time of\r\ndifficulty in the international economic system, the Kingdom\r\nof Saudi Arabia participated in the international donors’\r\nconference that recently concluded its meetings in\r\nWashington.\r\nThe Custodian of the two holy mosques has bestowed\r\nupon me the honour of announcing the Kingdom’s\r\ncommitment to providing substantial developmental\r\nassistance to improve the infrastructures in the West Bank\r\nand Gaza Strip in coordination and cooperation with the\r\nWorld Bank’s special five-year programme for the occupied\r\nterritories. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will participate,\r\nthrough the Saudi development fund, to the tune of\r\n$100 million for the year 1994. We believe that this\r\nassistance will improve the living conditions of our\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nPalestinian brethren in the occupied Arab territories and\r\ncontribute positively to the peace process.\r\nThe Lebanese Government has made great strides in its\r\nefforts to implement the Taif Accords, and has taken the\r\nnecessary political and constitutional measures to achieve\r\nthis aim. We must continue our support for the efforts of\r\nthe legitimate Lebanese authorities and contribute to the\r\nprocess of reconstruction in Lebanon.\r\nIn this regard, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appeals to\r\nthe international community to help Lebanon by all available\r\nmeans in order to enable its Government to continue moving\r\nforward with the process of reconstruction and allow\r\nLebanon to regain its material and cultural position.\r\nIt is important to reiterate the need, if this goal is to be\r\nachieved, for an Israeli commitment to implement, fully and\r\nunconditionally, United Nations Security Council resolution\r\n425 (1978), which requires Israel to withdraw from Lebanese\r\nterritory to enable the Lebanese Government to extend its\r\nlegal authority over all Lebanon.\r\nWe should like to emphasize our desire for the Middle\r\nEast region to obtain its legitimate share of security, peace\r\nand stability so that it is able to direct all its energies\r\ntowards development and devote all its resources towards\r\nprosperity for its people.\r\nOne of the most important tasks facing us in this\r\nrespect is to strive towards the elimination of weapons of\r\nmass destruction in the Middle East. The Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia is a signatory to the Convention on the\r\nnon-proliferation of chemical weapons and the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We continue to\r\nbelieve that the goal of making the Middle East a region free\r\nof all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, whether\r\nnuclear, chemical or biological, will be realized only when\r\nall States in the region, including Israel, refrain from the\r\nproduction, stockpiling, or possession of any kind of weapon\r\nof mass destruction.\r\nThe situation in the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is being aggravated by the continuation of a\r\ngenocidal war waged by Serb forces, with the support of\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, against that young Republic. The\r\ncontinuing tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nwhich has resulted in the death of thousands of innocent\r\ncivilians and the displacement of a large portion of its\r\ncitizens, would not have occurred were it not for the\r\napparent indifference of the international community. This\r\nattitude allowed the forces of aggression to benefit from\r\ntheir aggression, and to continue their abhorrent policy of\r\n\"ethnic cleansing\" without fear of retribution.\r\nThis feeble stand on the part the international\r\ncommunity, particularly the European countries, was\r\nreflected in the inability to implement comprehensively the\r\nresolutions of the London Conference, upon which we had\r\nrested great hopes. It is also reflected in the failure of the\r\nVance-Owen plan and the collapse of the subsequent Geneva\r\ntalks on refugees.\r\nThe international community’s dereliction of its\r\nresponsibilities vis-á-vis the Serb aggression has emboldened\r\nthe Croats to embark upon a similar course of making gains\r\nby means of force and coercion.\r\nAgainst such a backdrop, it was strange indeed that\r\nwhen Croatia was targeted by Serbian aggression, the\r\ninternational community, and especially the European\r\nnations, were quick to stand by Croatia and provide military\r\nassistance that contributed to the success of international\r\nefforts to achieve a peaceful settlement, whereas the\r\ninternational community’s feeble stance in the case of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and its failure to implement the\r\ninternational resolutions calling for the imposition of\r\neconomic sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, have\r\ndeprived that young Republic of the means of exercising its\r\nlegitimate right to self-defence. Those resolutions and the\r\nsanctions they call for remained dead letter and were not\r\nseriously implemented until it was too late, after the Serbs\r\nhad rejected the Vance-Owen Plan, which the Bosnians and\r\nCroats had accepted. What really shocks and amazes us is\r\nthat this war of aggression is being waged on the European\r\nsoil whereas history teaches us that such wars on that soil\r\nhave never been limited wars but have always overspilled\r\nbeyond the borders. However, no one seems to be paying\r\nany attention to those object-lessons.\r\nWhile we hope that the history of Europe’s wars will\r\nnot repeat itself, we hope that the solutions that are being\r\nproposed do not turn out to be the seeds of future conflicts\r\nand disputes. We hope that the international community will\r\ngive serious consideration to the demands of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina so that it may be saved from any\r\nrepetition of the policies of aggression and \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\". The geographical demands of that young nation\r\nshould be satisfied by granting it access to the sea as well as\r\nproviding it with the means of legitimate self-defence, in\r\nconsonance with the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 21\r\nThe principled stand by the people and Government of\r\nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in support of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina emanates from their strong and total\r\nadherence to international legality and respect for\r\ninternational law and not from any religious fanaticism or\r\nethnic affinity. It is the same principled stand that was taken\r\nby the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in support of Kuwait when\r\nit fell victim to the Iraqi regime’s aggression.\r\nSomalia continues to be in the grip of instability and\r\npolitical chaos, with all the attendant acts of violence and\r\nbloodshed, despite all the efforts deployed to help that nation\r\nout of its plight. International efforts, during the Conference\r\nfor National Reconciliation held at Addis Ababa, focused on\r\nthe preservation of the Somali State and the maintenance of\r\nits independence and territorial integrity. Unfortunately, the\r\nrequired steps have not been taken for the serious\r\nimplementation of that Agreement. The role of the United\r\nNations has been limited to the distribution of humanitarian\r\nassistance to those in need at a time when the role it is\r\nexpected to play within the new world order is to contribute\r\nto peacemaking and to the stabilization of the Somali State.\r\nSuch measures should help to establish a Somali\r\nGovernment that can extend its authority throughout\r\nSomalia.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a number of\r\nattempts to contain the conflict in Somalia and has tried to\r\nbring about national reconciliation among the various\r\nfactions. It will continue to deploy efforts to stop the\r\nbloodshed and to provide humanitarian assistance and relief.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s recommendations in his\r\nreport to the Security Council, on the means of helping re-\r\nestablish Somalia’s constitutional institutions and on the\r\nefforts needed to reach national reconciliation and to rebuild\r\nSomalia.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stood by the fraternal\r\npeople of Afghanistan throughout their jihad and celebrated\r\nwith them their victory over the forces of brutal occupation\r\nin the struggle for restoring their national identity. The\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia spared no effort in working for\r\nreconciliation when the infighting started between the\r\nvarious mujahidin factions. Those efforts were crowned\r\nwith the signing of the Mecca Agreement and the initiation\r\nof steps towards its implementation. A National\r\nGovernment that combined all factions of the Afghan\r\nmujahidin was established. We take this opportunity to urge\r\nour brethren in Afghanistan to comply with the terms of the\r\nagreement so that Afghanistan may begin to move towards\r\nreconstruction and development and regain its place and role\r\nin the international community.\r\nIt must be noted that that part of the world continues to\r\nsuffer as a result of the problem of Jammu and Kashmir,\r\nwhich continues to be an element of instability in the region.\r\nThe Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\r\nfollows with great concern the ongoing violence there. We\r\nare keen on finding a solution on the basis of United Nations\r\nresolutions to this long-standing problem that has\r\novershadowed the relations of the two neighbours, India and\r\nPakistan.\r\nAmong the other conflicts in Asia I would refer to the\r\ntragic developments resulting from the worsening conflict\r\nbetween two United Nations Member States, the Republic of\r\nAzerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia. That conflict has\r\nrecently resulted in the occupation by Armenia of parts of\r\nAzerbaijan. We consider that occupation to be a breach of\r\nthe principle of the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and\r\nemphasize the importance of withdrawal by Armenia’s\r\nforces from Azerbaijan’s territory in order to transfer that\r\nissue to the negotiating table with the aim of reaching a\r\npeaceful and just settlement that would ensure the legitimate\r\nrights of the people of Azerbaijan.\r\nOur joint and serious efforts towards consolidating the\r\nunderpinnings of the new world order aim at making it\r\npossible to address the issues of development and the\r\ncreation of an international economic environment in which\r\nfinancial resources would be diverted from arms races to\r\neconomic and social development. Those efforts are in\r\nkeeping with our ambitions and the aspirations of our\r\npeoples for a better world of peace, prosperity and security.\r\nSuch an enterprise requires the cooperation of the developed\r\nindustrial nations by opening their markets to the products\r\nof the developing nations, the elimination of protectionist\r\nmeasures, ensuring an early successful outcome to the\r\nUruguay Round of multilateral trade talks and finding an\r\nurgent, rapid solution to the debt problem. On the other\r\nhand, economic cooperation between the developing\r\ncountries themselves is a paramount issue and represents a\r\nfundamental tool for consolidating international economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nMy Government attaches great importance to issues\r\nrelating to the world economic system. The Kingdom of\r\nSaudi Arabia represents a State open to the world,\r\ninteracting with all the trends and developments that affect\r\nit. Thus, we are keen on preserving the health and strength\r\nof the world economy, and we are concerned by the\r\ndisruptions and turmoil that affect its course and\r\ndevelopment. It is on that basis that the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia is participating positively in the ongoing discussions\r\non energy and environment. We have shouldered our\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nresponsibilities in this regard and have played an active role\r\nin international discussions to find a workable and balanced\r\nsolution to global warming based on proven scientific\r\nevidence. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is convinced that\r\nthe future of this world, its prosperity, and the well-being of\r\nits inhabitants, depend on a clear understanding of the\r\nenvironmental problems that face us all and on fully\r\nunderstanding the consequences of the policies adopted in\r\ndealing with those problems.\r\nThis requires delicate balancing of the burdens and\r\ncommitments of each and every State in addressing problems\r\nof the environment. Due consideration should be given also\r\nto the situation of every energy producing or consumer\r\ndeveloping country and the effects of environmental policies\r\non the economic growth of those countries. Such an\r\napproach will certainly contribute to the achievement of\r\ncomprehensive development and to the betterment of our\r\npeoples’ standards of living so that they may all enjoy\r\nprosperity, peace, security and stability. The current\r\ninternational circumstances, resulting from the ending of the\r\ncold war, together with the progress achieved in arms control\r\nand reductions of conventional weapons afford us a rare\r\nopportunity for channelling the financial windfall towards\r\nsolving the problems of development and economic\r\nbackwardness.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been at the forefront\r\nof Islamic States that have adhered to the Cairo Declaration\r\non Human Rights in Islam, issued by the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference on 5 August 1990. This Cairo\r\nDeclaration should be regarded as a tributary providing the\r\nproper foundation for positive and practical international\r\ncooperation and flowing into the main stream of universal\r\nsupport for human rights and freedoms.\r\nMost particularly, the Declaration expresses the will of\r\nover 1 billion people, which by any measure grants it a\r\nuniversal character. While the principles and objectives of\r\nhuman rights are universal in nature, their application must\r\ntake into consideration the diversity of societies and their\r\nhistorical, cultural, and religious backgrounds and legal\r\nsystems. We should not rush to the creation of mechanisms\r\nthat would only deepen differences and disregard the sort of\r\nsensitivities that became noticeable during the World\r\nConference on Human Rights that was held recently in\r\nVienna.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a developing society\r\nfirmly based on the rules that constitute the pillars of Islamic\r\ncivilization. It is a society that has firmly set itself to face\r\nup to the challenges of our times with determination and\r\nconfidence, and it is a society undergoing evolution and\r\nsignificant reform. Its reforms are guided by the Custodian\r\nof the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aiz, and\r\nembodied in the basic laws of governance, the Charter of the\r\nMajlis al-Shura - the consultative council - and the laws of\r\nthe provinces. These laws place upon the State the primary\r\nresponsibility for the protection of human rights in\r\naccordance with the Islamic Shariah and determine the\r\nrelationship between ruler and ruled on the basis of\r\nbrotherhood, consultation, loyalty and cooperation.\r\nI am pleased to inform this body that the members of\r\nthe Majlis al-Shura and those of the provincial councils have\r\nbeen named. These institutions are now making serious\r\npreparations to embark upon their appointed tasks and to\r\nserve their faith, their King, and their nation. This important\r\nstep in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s development paves\r\nthe way for participation by Saudi citizens in sharing the\r\nresponsibility for confidently building a promising and\r\nhopeful future.\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 23\r\nThe political and economic challenges we face which\r\nabound on this session’s agenda, put a great burden of\r\nresponsibility on us all towards our peoples and nations.\r\nOur common future will depend on the way we face up to\r\nthose challenges. In the light of the current international\r\nsituation and of the emergence of a new international\r\noutlook which rejects fanaticism and ossification and\r\nconfirms a desire for openness and progress, we harbour\r\ngreat hopes that we shall be able to surmount those\r\nchallenges. In so doing, we must take into consideration the\r\nfact that the new international order will not be able to\r\nprovide us with the peace, justice and development we desire\r\nunless we give it the opportunity to do just that.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
