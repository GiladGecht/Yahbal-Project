Your undeniable\r\npersonal prestige and your recognized adherence to the\r\nideals that inspire our Organization will ensure the success\r\nof our work. Your country, Guyana, is a faithful contributor\r\nto and participant in the United Nations, and offers us today\r\nyour great experience and diplomatic skill; these ensure the\r\nsuccess of any decisions that may be taken at this session.\r\nThrough you, we should like to extend our congratulations\r\nto the other members of the Bureau in the conviction that\r\ntheir collaboration will be decisive.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the\r\noutgoing President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, and his\r\nBureau for the contributions and guidance they provided to\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly at its forty-seventh\r\nsession.\r\nI should also like to convey to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the profound appreciation and\r\ngratitude of His Excellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo and\r\nthe Government and the people of Equatorial Guinea for his\r\ndedication and the efforts he has exerted in discharging the\r\ngreat responsibilities with which he has been entrusted in a\r\nmanner that is a source of pride not only for Egypt but for\r\nall Africa. In carrying out his mission to promote the\r\npeaceful emergence of a new world order and the\r\nmaintenance of peace, I assure the Secretary-General that he\r\nwill be able to continue to rely on our full cooperation and\r\nsupport.\r\nTo the new States that have joined our Organization we\r\nextend a very warm welcome. Their presence here\r\nstrengthens the United Nations vocation towards universality,\r\nand should contribute to the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to maintain peace and promote progress and\r\njustice for all nations.\r\nMy presence in this world forum should be interpreted\r\nas a clear demonstration of the importance that we attach to\r\nthe United Nations, its principles and its noble task of\r\nconstantly strengthening the safeguards over the maintenance\r\nof peace and social and economic progress for all peoples.\r\nThis task is of singular importance to Equatorial Guinea,\r\nwhich is engaged in overcoming underdevelopment and\r\nachieving dignified standards of living for its people.\r\nThe common denominator of the many statements that\r\nhave been made has been the vast changes that have taken\r\nplace in the world since the mid-1980s, a trend towards\r\ntransformation the pace of which, far from decreasing, has\r\naccelerated considerably.\r\nWith the disappearance of the East-West bipolar\r\nstructure, which has been replaced by dialogue and\r\ncooperation, we find ourselves - and this is no exaggeration -\r\nfaced with a new configuration in international relations\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86867 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.29\r\n4 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncharacterized by a certain degree of progress in\r\ndisarmament, at the global and regional levels, and an easing\r\nof some regional conflicts.\r\nEquatorial Guinea firmly supports the intensification of\r\nthe work of the United Nations through preventive\r\ndiplomacy. Measures such as the sending of missions of\r\ninquiry, the use of early-warning systems and the\r\nstrengthening of the role of regional and subregional\r\norganizations can be effective in avoiding conflicts which,\r\nonce they break out, could require subsequent, much more\r\ncostly intervention for peace to be restored.\r\nPeace-keeping operations have also undergone\r\nqualitative change and now cover increasingly varied\r\nactivities transcending the traditional sphere. In this respect\r\nI should like to underscore the efforts of the United Nations\r\nin many parts of the world in the humanitarian field, in\r\nproviding aid to refugees and in monitoring elections.\r\nProgress and efforts at the subregional level are\r\ncommendable. Hence we support General Assembly\r\nresolution 46/37 B, establishing the Standing Advisory\r\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa, which\r\nis working for peace and confidence-building among the\r\nStates of our subregion. As a popular saying goes: \"An\r\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" With that\r\nCommittee we are trying to prevent the emergence of\r\nconflicts in the subregion by developing measures to\r\nalleviate situations of conflict.\r\nNone the less, despite these positive steps and\r\nendeavours, at the global level we look to the future with a\r\ncertain degree of concern because we still see certain\r\npositions that prevent equitable economic relations and\r\nimpede developing countries from exercising international\r\nfree trade. The sound of the machine-gun and the cannon is\r\nstill dashing the hopes of many innocent peoples to live in\r\npeace and tranquillity. The present international situation,\r\nwe might say, fluctuates between uneasiness and hope. We\r\nhope that the global changes and the end of the cold war\r\nwill bring renewed life to countries of the third world.\r\nThe industrialized countries must understand the need\r\nto resolve, on mutually agreed terms, the external debt\r\nproblem of underdeveloped countries. The weight of that\r\ndebt is another serious difficulty standing in the way of their\r\nachieving a better standard of living.\r\nMy country hopes that the new world scene will be\r\nconducive to the implementation of procedures for sincere\r\ninternational cooperation for those nations that most need\r\nsuch cooperation, countries that are now struggling not just\r\nfor a standard of living but for their very survival. Poverty,\r\nthe sad fate of many States in our world, requires that united\r\naction be taken by the other States in order to remedy the\r\nsituation. The gap between rich and poor is widening at an\r\nalarming pace; that disparity can not leave the international\r\ncommunity indifferent. Hence it is necessary to strengthen\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in order\r\nto meet the new realities.\r\nThe problem of preserving the environment and the\r\nstruggle against illicit drug-trafficking are questions that\r\nrequire our reflection. With the 1992 Stockholm Declaration\r\nwe laid the foundations of certain universal principles to\r\npreserve the global environment and made efforts to stem\r\npollution, desertification and deforestation. But the situation\r\nrequired new initiatives, and these culminated in the\r\nConference on Environment and Development, held in Rio\r\nde Janeiro.\r\nWe hope that these results will have positive effects\r\noverall and that it will be possible to ensure sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the future well-being of mankind.\r\nNone the less, I wish to emphasize the obligation of the\r\ndeveloped countries, which bear the greatest responsibility\r\nfor the deterioration of the global ecosystem, towards those\r\nother countries that are today being asked to make enormous\r\nsacrifices by limiting their legitimate right to use the assets\r\ngiven them by nature. There is a need to seek the necessary\r\ncompensation for this situation, in particular by the financing\r\nof alternative projects and through technological cooperation.\r\nWithin its modest economic means my Government has\r\nalways been, and remains, prepared to take action in order\r\nto improve its national environment as a contribution to the\r\ntask of preserving the global environment.\r\nWe condemn the illicit traffic in drugs and are prepared\r\nto support any international initiative aimed at its\r\nsuppression.\r\nThe Government of Equatorial Guinea is unflagging in\r\nits struggle against the acquired immune deficiency\r\nsyndrome (AIDS) pandemic, and it will spare no effort for\r\nits effective control, thanks to the deep awareness of our\r\npeople and the assistance we receive in this connection from\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nTo reflect the noble ideals of peace and justice of the\r\npeople of Equatorial Guinea, my Government has embarked\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 3\r\non a progressive democratic process that guarantees to every\r\ncitizen of the country the exercise of fundamental rights and\r\nfreedoms.\r\nThe firm democratic process begun in the country has\r\nbeen well-received by the people of Equatorial Guinea and\r\nby those countries that set aside mere rhetoric and concealed\r\npolitical interests, love Equatorial Guinea and hope that it\r\nwill progress. The aspiration of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea is that our process will be\r\ncarried through in a climate of national concord without\r\nupheaval, without disturbances that could threaten the peace\r\nand stability prevailing in the country.\r\nThat is why, following the massive adoption of the new\r\nfundamental law which enshrined our multiparty system, in\r\nthe context of Law No. 3 1992 on political parties, the\r\nfollowing political organizations have been made legal.\r\nFirst, the Popular Union submitted its application on\r\n24 April 1992 and was recognized on 17 October 1992.\r\nSecond, the Liberal Democratic Convention submitted\r\nits application on 1 April 1992 and was recognized on 17\r\nOctober 1992.\r\nThird, the Social Democrat Party submitted its\r\napplication on 8 June 1992 and was recognized on 17\r\nOctober 1992.\r\nFourth, the Progressive Democratic Alliance submitted\r\nits application on 9 July 1992 and was recognized on 4\r\nSeptember 1992.\r\nFifth, the Social Democratic Union submitted its\r\napplication on 8 June 1992 and was recognized on 17\r\nOctober 1992.\r\nSixth, the Progress Party submitted its application on\r\n18 May 1992 and was recognized on 17 October 1992.\r\nSeventh, the Social Democratic and Popular\r\nConvergence submitted its application on 18 May 1992 and\r\nwas recognized on 5 February 1993.\r\nEighth, the Social Democratic Coalition Party of\r\nEquatorial Guinea submitted its application on 4 November\r\n1992 and was recognized on 5 February 1993.\r\nNinth, Convergence for Social Democracy submitted its\r\napplication on 7 November 1992 and was recognized on\r\n5 February 1993.\r\nTenth, the Equatorial Guinea Popular Action submitted\r\nits application on 28 December 1992 and was recognized on\r\n5 February 1993.\r\nEleventh, the National Democratic Union submitted its\r\napplication on 29 March 1993 and was recognized on 10\r\nMay 1993.\r\nTwelfth, the Socialist Party of Equatorial Guinea\r\nsubmitted its application on 23 March 1993 and was\r\nrecognized on 10 May 1993.\r\nThirteenth, the Liberal Party submitted its application\r\non 23 March 1993 and was recognized on 12 July 1993.\r\nIn addition to other provisions, such as the law\r\nguaranteeing freedom of association and freedom to\r\ndemonstrate, and the law on the right to protest and to\r\npetition, the determination of the Government to establish\r\ndemocracy peacefully in the country has taken concrete\r\nshape in the signing of a document - called the National\r\nPact - between the Government and the opposition, which\r\nreflects the combined aspirations of all the political forces\r\nand is a channel for ensuring the success of the\r\ndemocratization process.\r\nOut of our constant desire to give greater political\r\ntransparency to the process, we have postponed until 21\r\nNovember 1993 the legislative elections originally planned\r\nfor 12 September 1993. We have done so in order to take\r\ninto account and meet the wishes of certain political groups.\r\nThe political spectrum for the forthcoming general\r\nlegislative elections now looks like this: there are political\r\nparties that have decided to participate in the legislative\r\nelections, political parties that intend to participate in the\r\nlegislative elections, and political parties that have not yet\r\ndecided whether to participate in the legislative elections.\r\nThe political parties that have decided to participate in\r\nthe legislative elections are: the Democratic Party of\r\nEquatorial Guinea, the Liberal Democratic Convention, the\r\nSocial Democratic Union, the Liberal Party and the Social\r\nDemocratic Party. This very morning, my Government\r\ninformed me that the Party of the Convergence for Social\r\nand People’s Democracy has also decided to participate in\r\nthe legislative elections.\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe political parties that have expressed their intention\r\nto participate in the legislative elections are: the Progress\r\nParty, Tomás Boi Cheky Division; and the Social Democrat\r\nCoalition Party, Massoko Division.\r\nWith regard to the political parties that have not\r\ndecided whether to participate in the legislative elections, the\r\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea has received no official\r\nnotification of a decision to participate in the legislative\r\nelections of 21 November from the following political\r\nparties: the Progress Party, Severo Moto Division; the\r\nSocial Democratic Convergence; the Progressive Democratic\r\nAlliance; the Social Democrat Coalition Party, Buenaventura\r\nMonsuy Division; People’s Action of Equatorial Guinea; the\r\nNational Democratic Union; and the Socialist Party of\r\nEquatorial Guinea.\r\nIn connection with the revision of the electoral law\r\nproposed by the opposition political parties, on 19 October\r\nand 13 and 18 November the Government extended an\r\ninvitation to these parties to participate in some meetings,\r\nbut they did not come to the meetings or give any reason for\r\nnot doing so.\r\nIn view of the opposition parties’ inexplicable refusal\r\nto participate, and in order to avoid any stagnation in the\r\npolitical democratization process, the Government used its\r\nlegislative initiative, under our Basic Law, to adopt a draft\r\nlaw, which was sent to the House of Representatives and\r\napproved with amendments by that legislative body. The\r\ntext of the law was approved and promulgated by our Head\r\nof State in January 1993.\r\nIt should be pointed out that the electoral law now in\r\nforce is based on comparative law - mainly the electoral\r\nlegislation of Spain, France and Gabon. For that reason, the\r\nGovernment is firmly convinced that the rejection of the\r\nelectoral law by the opposition political parties that have not\r\nexpressed their intention to participate in the legislative\r\nelections of 21 November 1993 is nothing but a pretext for\r\ndelaying or blocking the process that has been set in motion.\r\nThere is no doubt that the implementation of the democratic\r\nprocess in Equatorial Guinea has been made possible by the\r\nselflessness and determination of His Excellency Obiang\r\nNguema Mbasogo, who, after freedom had triumphed on\r\n3 August 1979, overthrew the dictatorship and began the real\r\nmarch of the country towards democracy in a climate of\r\npeace and harmony, which the advocates of violence wish to\r\ndestroy with their provocations and their contemptible plots.\r\nWe in Equatorial Guinea totally reject the views of the\r\napologists violence and their attempts to undermine national\r\npeace and stability. We reject those who do nothing but\r\ndefame our country and our Government, denigrating the\r\nactions that have been undertaken thus far in the country.\r\nA democracy imposed by foreign interests becomes\r\ncorrupt and falls apart. A democracy that denies the\r\ngenuine, traditional and sacred values of a people not only\r\nhurts the feelings, the pride and the honour of that people\r\nbut is also doomed to failure. \"Man is what circumstances\r\ndictate\", affirmed the great Spanish philosopher Balmes.\r\nThat is why only a democracy that can respond to the sacred\r\ninterests of the people of Equatorial Guinea will be viable in\r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea. In documents A/48/307\r\nof 12 August 1993, A/48/330 of 19 August 1993, and\r\nA/48/357 of 31 August 1993, our Government presented\r\ninformation on the interference of certain foreign interests in\r\nmy country’s internal affairs. From this rostrum, we are\r\nholding the countries responsible for that interference\r\nresponsible for the consequences.\r\nWe reaffirm that only in an atmosphere of peace is it\r\npossible to achieve the progress and well-being to which all\r\npeoples aspire. To the governmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations and friendly countries that, with their support,\r\nhave contributed to the efforts of our Government, we\r\nexpress our deepest appreciation, and we urge them to\r\ncontinue to lend their support and cooperation at this\r\ndecisive stage in our democratic process.\r\nIntelligent action in this new global society must be\r\nbased on the exercise of the firmest solidarity. If that is\r\ndone, we shall be able to say with pride, \"We the peoples,\r\nfor a better world.\"\r\nMr. MATTHEWS (Liberia): I wish to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are sure\r\nthat your vast experience, personal qualifications, and\r\nintimate knowledge of the manifold problems confronting the\r\ninternational community will serve you well in the\r\nperformance of your duties. Please be assured of the fullest\r\ncooperation and support of the Liberian delegation.\r\nWe extend a deserving tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, for the efficient and able\r\nmanner in which he handled the affairs of the Assembly\r\nduring the past year. His decisiveness and fairness paid off\r\ngreatly in producing the many results which are a positive\r\noutgrowth of the debate of the previous session.\r\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, also\r\ndeserves special commendation for his persistent and tireless\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 5\r\nefforts in trying to secure a world that is both peaceful and\r\njust and sustained by an equitable economic order. Indeed,\r\nhis devotion and singular commitment to the principles and\r\npurposes of the Organization have brought renewed\r\nconfidence on the prospects of achieving mankind’s dream\r\nof a stable international environment.\r\nWe seize this opportunity to welcome the\r\nnewly-admitted Members of the United Nations. It is our\r\nfervent hope that they will make a meaningful contribution\r\nto our common search for global peace and security.\r\nOver the past three years Liberia’s external relations, in\r\nresponse to domestic imperatives, have focused on the\r\nachievement of four primary objectives: first, to ensure that\r\ninternational opinion is sensitized to the serious effects of\r\nthe civil war in Liberia and the need for international\r\nsupport to end the conflict; secondly, to effect the\r\nmobilization of humanitarian and emergency relief assistance\r\nfor the war-ravaged population; thirdly, to help sustain the\r\nconsensus on the situation in Liberia within the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), and to\r\nsecure broader international acceptance of the ECOWAS\r\npeace plan as the best possible formula for resolving the\r\nLiberian civil strife; and, fourthly, to enhance the peace\r\nprocess itself by neutralizing attempts to resolve the Liberian\r\nconflict through the military victory of a faction, while\r\nencouraging a negotiated political settlement of this\r\nseemingly intractable conflict.\r\nIn pursuit of these objectives, the Interim Government\r\nof National Unity (IGNU) has participated in 25 peace talks\r\nand a great number of other consultations with the Liberian\r\nfactions, the leaders of subregional, regional and\r\ninternational organizations, and foreign Governments to\r\nenhance the prospects for peace in Liberia.\r\nIt is now my pleasing duty to inform the Assembly that\r\nthe Interim Government of National Unity, the National\r\nPatriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and the United Liberation\r\nMovement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) signed a\r\npeace accord in Cotonou, the Republic of Benin, on 25 July\r\n1993. The Cotonou Agreement is a significant breakthrough\r\nin the quest for durable peace in Liberia.\r\nBy agreeing on a process beginning with a cease-fire\r\nand leading to disarmament, demobilization and then free\r\nand fair elections, we Liberians have all finally decided on\r\nhow power will be acquired in our country. The Agreement\r\nis therefore a great victory for the people of Liberia in their\r\nefforts to secure a democratic future.\r\nAs my delegation stated on 10 August 1993 during the\r\nSecurity Council’s consideration of the report (S/26200) of\r\nthe Secretary-General on Liberia, the Cotonou Agreement is\r\nalso a victory for the leaders and peoples of the member\r\nStates of the Economic Community of West African States,\r\nwho took a bold and courageous initiative to resolve a\r\nsecurity question in their subregion, with the active support\r\nand cooperation of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU).\r\nOn that occasion, we went on to state, and we here\r\nrepeat, that the United Nations must also share in this\r\nvictory. In this vein we wish to register our appreciation to\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his consuming\r\ninterest in the crisis in Liberia. We thank him immensely\r\nfor his thorough and incisive reports on Liberia, which\r\nenhanced the decisiveness of the Security Council with\r\nrespect to resolutions 788 (1992), 813 (1993) and\r\n866 (1993).\r\nWe also commend the Secretary-General’s Special\r\nRepresentative for Liberia, Mr. Trevor Gordon-Somers; the\r\nOAU Eminent Person for Liberia, former Zimbabwean\r\nPresident the Rev. Dr. Canaan Banana; and the former\r\nExecutive Secretary of ECOWAS, Dr. Abbas Bundu; whose\r\nrelentless collaborative efforts helped to make the Cotonou\r\nAgreement a reality.\r\nThe people of Liberia will for ever remain grateful to\r\nthe gallant men and women of the ECOWAS Cease-fire\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). Enduring thanks go to the\r\nWest African States which have made troop contributions to\r\nthe peace-keeping effort: Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra\r\nLeone, Gambia, Mali and Senegal.\r\nDuring the process of negotiating the Cotonou\r\nAgreement, the Interim Government, largely a coalition of\r\nvarious political parties and interest groups representing the\r\nvast majority of our citizenry who do not bear arms,\r\ndemanded the disarmament of all combatants as a sine qua\r\nnon for the restoration of peace. The armed factions\r\nconceded to this demand on condition that a new,\r\ntransitional authority, to include the Interim Government, be\r\norganized within a framework acceptable to them. This\r\nconcession, hardly an unreasonably high price to pay for\r\ndisarmament and peace, was made. The Cotonou\r\nAgreement, then, divided into a military and a political\r\ncomponent, encompasses provisions attending a trade-off.\r\nThe political demands are far-reaching, in that they\r\nrequire more than a simple reconfiguration of the Interim\r\nGovernment within the context of power-sharing. The\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nLiberian National Transitional Government, being a new\r\ncreation, requires the divestiture of power from the current\r\ninterim authorities. On the other hand, the warring factions,\r\ndivested of their arms and demobilized, will equally cease to\r\nexist as fighting forces.\r\nTo strengthen the Agreement, or otherwise reinforce the\r\nconfidence of the parties, it was agreed that the installing of\r\nthe Transitional Government, and the beginning of the\r\ndisarmament process, each being a precondition for the\r\nother, would ensue simultaneously. However, this demand\r\nfor concurrent processes harbours the prospective danger that\r\nan achievement lag in either component, military or political,\r\nmay tend to undermine confidence in the entire peace\r\nprocess and thereby threaten the understanding.\r\nWhat, then, does each phase require, and how much\r\nand in what area has progress been made?\r\nThe implementation of the political phase of the\r\nAccords has largely been completed, and on schedule. The\r\nInterim Government has complied with all the concessions\r\nrequired for disarmament so that Liberians may live free\r\nfrom fear and have a chance of being at peace with each\r\nother.\r\nA five-member Council of State has been formed to\r\nconstitute the executive authority of the Transitional\r\nGovernment. The legislature, the judiciary, and the\r\nElections Commission are being reorganized or otherwise\r\nmade to reflect the inclusive intent of the transitional period.\r\nThe Liberian National Transitional Government is waiting to\r\nbe installed once the disarmament process begins. Pacta\r\nsunt servanda. What, then, is the requirement for the\r\ndisarmament process to begin? The following paragraph\r\nfrom the report of the Secretary-General on Liberia, of 4\r\nAugust 1993, correctly reflects the specific provisions of the\r\nagreement and the factor motivating them. The\r\nSecretary-General states:\r\n\"Given the level of mistrust existing between\r\nECOMOG and the NPFL, special measures were\r\ndevised to make ECOMOG acceptable to all parties in\r\noverseeing encampment, disarmament and\r\ndemobilization. It was agreed that ECOMOG would be\r\nexpanded to include new troops from countries not\r\nalready participating in ECOMOG. These troops would\r\nbe drawn from other ECOWAS countries, as well as\r\nfrom OAU countries outside of the West African\r\nsubregion. In addition, it was proposed that United\r\nNations military observers would monitor and verify\r\nthe cease-fire as well as the implementation of the\r\nencampment, disarmament and demobilization\r\nprovisions of the Agreement.\" (S/26200, para. 7)\r\nA month later, in September 1993, the\r\nSecretary-General, recognizing that these preparations for\r\ndisarmament would not keep pace with the political\r\narrangements, advanced a most constructive proposal in his\r\nreport of 9 September 1993 as follows:\r\n\"... The Agreement forecasts that the\r\ntransitional government would be established\r\napproximately one month after the signing of the\r\nagreement, concomitant with the commencement of\r\nthe disarmament process. While this process is\r\nalready somewhat behind schedule, the establishment\r\nof the transitional government is crucial to\r\nreinforcing national reconciliation. I therefore urge\r\nECOMOG to move quickly in commencing the\r\ndisarmament process, with monitoring provided by\r\nthe advance team of UNOMIL, even before full\r\ndeployment of the expanded ECOMOG and\r\nUNOMIL. In this regard, it is encouraging to note\r\nthat NPFL expressed to the planning mission its\r\nreadiness to accept troops from among the present\r\nECOMOG contingent to be deployed in NPFL areas.\r\nWith the expected full deployment of the advanced\r\nteam of United Nations military observers in the\r\ncoming days, the disarmament process could possibly\r\nbegin immediately thereafter.\" (S/26422, para. 40)\r\nLast week in Monrovia, Dr. Amos Sawyer, the\r\nPresident of the Interim Government of National Unity,\r\npublicly assured the Liberian people that if the armed\r\nfactions accept the Secretary-General’s proposal and allow\r\nthe disarmament process to commence, he would\r\nimmediately transfer power to the transitional authorities.\r\nHowever, the unwillingness of any of the armed factions to\r\navail itself of the proposal need not necessarily be viewed as\r\nreflective of a lack of will or suggestive of bad faith.\r\nScrupulous adherence to the actual terms of the Agreement\r\nmay ultimately enhance the prospects for genuine peace,\r\nhowever slow and exacting the process may prove to be.\r\nMeanwhile, efforts continue to get the full complement of\r\nadditional ECOMOG forces and United Nations observers.\r\nThe Government of Liberia wishes to thank the United\r\nStates Government for its contribution to the Trust Fund of\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States to\r\nfacilitate the expansion of ECOMOG and assist the forces\r\ncurrently in place. We renew our request to other friendly\r\nGovernments to respond to the Secretary-General’s appeal\r\nfor contributions to the Trust Fund as a means of advancing\r\nthe peace process in Liberia.\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 7\r\nWe are convinced that the enabling conditions for\r\ndisarmament will be expeditiously created and that the\r\nTransitional Government will be installed shortly. The fact\r\nthat the cease-fire continues to hold and that the parties are\r\nlargely cooperating with each other is a basis for continuing\r\nconfidence in the commitment of the parties.\r\nOur hearts are touched by the great outpouring of\r\nempathy and good will from countries that have contributed\r\nto the well-being of the people of Liberia since the\r\nbeginning of our conflict. Through the specialized agencies\r\nof the United Nations system, as well as many private\r\nvolunteer and non-governmental organizations, they have\r\nenabled many Liberians to find life worth living because of\r\nthe genuine concern that has been demonstrated. Our thanks\r\ngo to all those who continue to make a difference in the\r\nlives of our people.\r\nThe Transitional Government, when installed with\r\nauthority spanning the entire country, will stand in need of\r\nextensive relief assistance to respond effectively to the\r\nmonumental human suffering existing in some parts of\r\nLiberia. Our delegation envisages an upsurge in the demand\r\nfor humanitarian assistance, with food and medical supplies\r\nbeing the obvious priorities. We appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to stand ready to assist the people of Liberia for\r\na reasonable period, as it will take time before the\r\nadvantages of peace are translated into real improvements in\r\nthe lives of the people.\r\nA successful disarmament exercise will be the\r\nlong-awaited signal for our people in refugee camps to\r\nreturn home. Indeed, the Transitional Government will need\r\nthe cooperation and assistance of men of good will\r\neverywhere in order to succeed in the awesome tasks of\r\nrepatriation, resettlement and rehabilitation. The gruesome\r\ncivil war devastated the economy of the country, paralysed\r\nvital social services and destroyed basic infrastructure. It is\r\nsignificant that the political division of the country has\r\nprevented a coordinated needs survey to fully assess the\r\nreconstruction demand.\r\nIt is important, also, that the Transitional Government\r\nhas the task of helping to prepare the country for free and\r\nfair elections, to be held under international supervision and\r\nmonitoring within six to seven months. This is hardly ideal\r\ntiming, but it proved to be the best that a negotiated\r\nsettlement could produce. Clearly, the international\r\ncommunity has a moral obligation to help the people of\r\nLiberia succeed in this endeavour, since the very thought of\r\nfailure attending these exercises is, in itself, a nightmare.\r\nThe Interim Government has striven, even in the\r\nthroes of a civil war, to maintain law and order and operate\r\nwith a Constitution which affirms civil liberties and respect\r\nfor fundamental human rights. We, as men of conscience,\r\ncondemn and stand in total opposition against those who, in\r\nthe midst of the war, trained their weapons on helpless\r\ncivilians. We therefore thank the Secretary-General for\r\nresponding with dispatch to the Interim Government’s\r\nrequest for the establishment of a commission of inquiry to\r\ninvestigate the atrocities committed since the commencement\r\nof the civil war. We believe that the Wako Commission\r\nReport has contributed to amassing the evidence required in\r\norder for justice to be done to the perpetrators of the Harbel\r\narea massacre and other massacres.\r\nLiberia’s tragic circumstances, coupled with the\r\nefforts to resolve the conflict, provide useful lessons that\r\ncould be most instructive for the international community.\r\nThe Liberian peace process has shown that, even in the face\r\nof scarce resources, member States of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States have contained a security\r\nthreat in their subregion by marshalling the requisite political\r\nwill to do so. The dispatch and maintenance of a peace-\r\nkeeping force in Liberia by the leaders of ECOWAS\r\nrepresent the finest hour for Africa in its efforts to maintain\r\npeace and security on the continent.\r\nThe Liberian experience has also demonstrated that\r\npeace initiatives that are conceived and implemented within\r\na subregional context, while supported and assisted by\r\nregional and international organizations, are a practical\r\napproach which stands the best chance of success in conflict\r\nresolution. The States closest to the conflict are likely to\r\nhave a deeper understanding of, and appreciation for, the\r\ninterplay of forces within the milieu. It is against this\r\nbackground that the Government of Liberia gave its fullest\r\nsupport for, and endorsement of, the establishment of a\r\nmechanism for conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution within the Organization of African Unity.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the Department of\r\nPeace-keeping Operations in the Secretariat for the planning\r\nand coordination of all United Nations peace-keeping\r\nactivities, confident that it will countenance greater regional\r\ninvolvement in conflict management, buttressed by support\r\nfrom the United Nations.\r\nOn the question of Somalia, the Government of\r\nLiberia welcomes the bold and courageous efforts by the\r\nUnited Nations to resolve the tragic situation there and bring\r\npeace to that country. We deplore the killing of United\r\nNations peace-keepers in Mogadishu, and we support the\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nefforts by this world body to bring to justice those\r\nresponsible for such acts. The implementation of the Addis\r\nAbaba Accords, signed on 27 March 1993, at the national\r\nreconciliation conference, offers the best hope for a peaceful\r\ntransition to a pacified and democratic State of Somalia. We\r\ntherefore urge the Somali factions to respect and implement\r\nthat agreement.\r\nRegarding South Africa, we welcome the current\r\nmulti-party negotiations in that country as the most inclusive\r\nforum so far convened to end the apartheid system and\r\ncreate a non-racial, democratic society. We are pleased that,\r\nas a result of these negotiations, a democratic Government\r\nis scheduled to be elected in April 1994.\r\nWith regard to Angola, the Government of Liberia\r\nwishes to call on UNITA to abandon its military agenda and\r\nseek to resolve the crisis through peaceful means in\r\nconformity with the Bicesse Accords. In this light, we also\r\nmake a special appeal to UNITA to conform to the wishes\r\nof the people of Angola by accepting the results of the\r\nSeptember 1992 elections. We call on it to sign the protocol\r\nof agreement negotiated in Abidjan in a spirit of national\r\nunity and reconciliation of all Angolans.\r\nLast month the world welcomed the historic and\r\ndramatic developments affecting peace in the Middle East,\r\nwhen the Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO) recognized each other. The signing of\r\nan agreement on Palestinian autonomy means that the first\r\nreal step has indeed been taken towards Palestinian self-rule.\r\nIt is our sincerest hope that this agreement will soon be\r\ncomplemented by peace accords between Israel and all of its\r\nArab neighbours.\r\nPerhaps no problem, apart from the spectre of a\r\nnuclear holocaust, has elicited more global concern than that\r\nof the environment, given its intrinsic linkage to man’s\r\nsurvival and his economic well-being. In a world\r\ncharacterized by issues of common concern and\r\never-increasing interdependence of States, a collective\r\napproach is indispensable in meeting the challenges posed by\r\nenvironmental problems and the international economic\r\nsituation. The environmental crisis is now posing a serious\r\nthreat to the life-support system of our planet. This is why\r\nmy delegation believes it is most important that Member\r\nStates maintain the momentum gained at the historic 1992\r\nConference on Environment and Development, held in Rio\r\nde Janeiro, by effective follow-up at the national and\r\ninternational levels. We welcome the establishment of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development whose\r\nresponsibility it is to review and monitor implementation of\r\nAgenda 21.\r\nWith respect to the world economic situation, it\r\nremains our firm belief that, in order to achieve progress in\r\nglobal economic recovery, issues of long-term significance,\r\nsuch as the excruciating debt burden of developing countries,\r\nlow commodity prices, protectionism and dwindling resource\r\nflow into developing countries, should all form the real\r\nagenda for the setting of priorities to include a permanent\r\nincrease in global economic growth. The current gloomy\r\nsituation of the international economy, worse now than in\r\nthe previous decade, is further accentuated by new risks to\r\nthe world economy caused by conflicts, the problem of\r\nrefugees and the plight of the world’s children. These\r\nproblems pose a real threat to growth and development in\r\nmany regions of the world.\r\nIn view of what I have said, there is an urgent need,\r\nas a part of the continuing effort to forge a new and fairer\r\ninternational economic order, for the peace dividends derived\r\nfrom the easing of bipolar tension to be deployed to meet\r\nthe development needs of the world’s most economically\r\ndisadvantaged regions. They should not be reserved for the\r\nexclusive use of the already wealthy nations, and they should\r\nnot be directed only towards the political and economic\r\nliberalization of a particular region of the world. All must\r\ntake into account the fact that economic opportunity and\r\nsocial justice are essential preconditions for peace and\r\nsecurity in our global village.\r\nThe post-cold-war era has offered the United Nations\r\nnew opportunities and challenges, particularly in the\r\nfulfilment of its unique responsibility as the conscience of\r\nmankind. In recent years, the United Nations has taken bold\r\ndecisions in peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building,\r\nhumanitarian intervention and the protection of human rights.\r\nThese assertive approaches have made the United Nations\r\nappear more relevant to the peoples of the world.\r\nIt is hoped that, in its honourable pursuits, the United\r\nNations will continue to be led by men of vision who can\r\nensure the realization of the noble ideals enshrined in its Charter -\r\nfostering world peace and promoting development and\r\ncooperation amongst all the peoples of our one world.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have heard the last speaker\r\nin the general debate.\r\nI am informed that the representative of Azerbaijan\r\nhas requested to exercise the right of reply. May I remind\r\nhim that statements in exercise of the right of reply are\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 9\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to five\r\nminutes for the second intervention, and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nI now call on the representative of Azerbaijan to\r\nspeak in the exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. ALIYEV (Azerbaijan): I have asked to speak in\r\nexercise of my right of reply, under rule 73 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, in order to refer to a statement made earlier by\r\nthe representative of the Republic of Armenia.\r\nThe statement made by the Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of Armenia contains many colourful epithets\r\nregarding his country. He appeals for the sympathy of\r\nrepresentatives by declaring that he is the Foreign Minister\r\nof a small country under a total blockade and under constant\r\nprovocation by Azerbaijan to be drawn into the Nagorny\r\nKarabakh conflict.\r\nI do not like to use the high rostrum of this\r\nAssembly to take up once again a discussion on this conflict.\r\nThe facts are widely known, but they have been\r\nmisrepresented by the Minister.\r\nHow is it possible to speak of Armenia being drawn\r\ninto the Nagorny Karabakh conflict when it was that\r\ncountry’s Parliament which adopted, back in 1989, the\r\ndecision to annex the Nagorny Karabakh region of\r\nAzerbaijan? This decision was taken even though the\r\ninternational community, the United Nations and the Security\r\nCouncil explicitly and unequivocally agreed that Nagorny\r\nKarabakh is and must be an integral part of Azerbaijan.\r\nIt is no secret that, under the guise of the high\r\nprinciple of self-determination and with the aim of\r\nexpanding its territory, Armenia initiated, and for over six\r\nyears has been waging, an undeclared war against\r\nAzerbaijan. The results of this war are well known. The\r\nMinister himself mentioned in his statement that the conflict\r\nhad claimed the lives of more than 10,000 persons and had\r\ncaused more than a million innocent people to become\r\nrefugees and displaced persons. The Minister failed to\r\nmention, however, that Azerbaijan is the home of the million\r\ndisplaced persons. He also omitted the fact that the war is\r\ntaking place exclusively on Azerbaijani territory. One fifth\r\nof its land has been occupied by the Armenian military\r\nforces, that is, four times more than the territory of the\r\nNagorny Karabakh region itself, which is the object of\r\nterritorial claims by Armenia in Azerbaijan.\r\nTaking into consideration the fact that Armenia is\r\npractically waging an undeclared war against Azerbaijan in\r\nthe latter’s territory, the question of a so-called blockade\r\nallegedly imposed by Azerbaijan on Armenia seems illogical.\r\nIt is evident that the breaking off of communications and\r\ntransport connections is the inevitable result of any military\r\nconflict between two countries. Armenia borders not only\r\non Azerbaijan, but on three other countries, and it is not in\r\na state of conflict with them. It is therefore able to use their\r\ntransportation lines in order to receive all necessary goods.\r\nHowever, as a result of the war that was imposed by\r\nArmenia on Azerbaijan, the entire Nakhichevan region of\r\nAzerbaijan is now totally cut off from the rest of the\r\ncountry.\r\nWith regard to Armenia’s interpretation of the\r\nconcept of self-determination, which was colourfully\r\ndescribed in the statement, I would like to point out that\r\nArmenia became outspoken in this policy only after\r\nexpelling the remaining 215,000 Azerbaijanis from the\r\ncountry that had been their home for centuries. As a result\r\nof this, Armenia had become a unique monoethnic State,\r\nwhere practically no ethnic or religious minorities exist. No\r\nminorities - no problems.\r\nConsequently, a country such as Armenia cannot be\r\njustified in proclaiming itself the advocate of the right of\r\nself-determination in another country, especially when it is\r\npursuing unfounded territorial claims in that country - claims\r\nwhich have been endorsed de jure by a decision of the\r\nArmenian Parliament.\r\nIncidentally, thousands of Azerbaijanis had been\r\nliving in Armenia without any form of autonomy. The\r\nArmenian community of the Nagorny Karabakh region of\r\nAzerbaijan, on the other hand, enjoyed autonomy in the\r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural aspects of their lives.\r\nThere are over a hundred different peoples and ethnic groups\r\nin Azerbaijan, and all of them have equal rights.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to point out that\r\nArmenia’s declaration that it is the only democracy in the\r\nregion is offensive to neighbouring countries. Presidential\r\nelections were recently held in Azerbaijan that were\r\nmonitored by various international observers, such as\r\nrepresentatives of the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, the International Labor Organisation,\r\nmembers of parliament, and representatives of human rights\r\norganizations from a number of countries, and of the\r\ndiplomatic corps, and all agreed that the process was fully\r\ndemocratic. It is ironic for Armenia to declare itself \"an\r\nisland of stability in a sea of political chaos and turmoil\"\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-eighth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 24th meeting, p. 24 of\r\nprovisional) after it has annexed part of another country’s\r\nterritory and uprooted a million innocent people.\r\nSTATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT\r\nThe PRESIDENT: At the conclusion of a most\r\ninteresting debate, I am prompted to make a brief\r\nobservation on its general thrust so that we may be\r\nadequately oriented in the future work of the Assembly.\r\nIn comparison with recent debates, this year’s has\r\nbeen remarkable - at least in my view - for its vision and\r\nsense of purpose in addressing the global agenda for the rest\r\nof this century and beyond. I would wish to thank all\r\ndelegations which participated for the thoughtful insights\r\nprovided through our collective review of the international\r\npolitical, economic and social situation. More particularly,\r\nI would like to acknowledge with profound gratitude the\r\nwarm tributes paid to my region, my country and myself.\r\nRepresentatives may be assured that I will do my utmost to\r\nsatisfy their expectations of the presidency.\r\nIt has been truly encouraging to perceive,\r\nnotwithstanding the grave uncertainties now prevailing in\r\ninternational relations, that there exists a widespread\r\noptimism about the Organization’s capacity to satisfy the\r\nexpectations and needs of its membership. There seems to be\r\na renewed commitment, by all States, to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter and a ready acknowledgement of\r\nthe concept of interdependence, which must now be\r\ntranslated into actual cooperation. We must seek to infuse\r\nthis unity of spirit into our deliberations as we come to\r\naddress the many issues on our agenda.\r\nIndeed, the end of the cold war revealed and released\r\nethnic and nationalist tensions which had been repressed, and\r\nbrought back behaviour which we thought had receded far\r\ninto history. There is now stronger support - stronger than\r\never - for United Nations preventive diplomacy,\r\npeacemaking and peace-keeping, reflecting the bold plans\r\nset out in the Secretary-General’s \"Agenda for Peace\".\r\nDuring the coming weeks we shall have the opportunity to\r\nexplore further the several proposals which have been made\r\non how to strengthen further our capacity in this area.\r\nI am especially pleased, however, to see a universal\r\ndisposition to complement the \"Agenda for Peace\" with one\r\nfor development in order to address the urgent economic\r\nand social problems which confront the majority of our\r\npeoples. Statements have invariably stressed the need for\r\nmaximum international economic cooperation to improve the\r\nglobal economy and, more particularly, the disadvantaged\r\nsituation of the developing countries.\r\nMany positive ideas, encompassing the issues of debt,\r\ndevelopment assistance, trade and the preservation of the\r\nenvironment, have emerged from this comprehensive\r\nanalysis. These should provide substantial input to the\r\nSecond Committee’s consideration of the agenda item on an\r\nagenda for development, which should in turn provide a\r\nbasis for the furtherance and completion of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on this important subject.\r\nEqually noteworthy has been the eagerness with\r\nwhich delegations seem prepared to advance our work to\r\nreform and restructure the United Nations to make it more\r\nadapted and adaptable to the times in which we now live.\r\nThere is a distinct perception in the House that many, if not\r\nall, of the organs, as presently conceived and constituted, are\r\nill-suited to prevailing circumstances and the satisfaction of\r\nour many needs. Considerable focus has been placed on the\r\nSecurity Council, which, in the eyes of many, requires\r\nenlargement and more transparent operations so as better to\r\nrepresent the membership in dealing with the complex\r\nquestions relating to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. Great interest has also been evinced in\r\nstrengthening the ability of the economic and social bodies,\r\nincluding their governing councils, to address their respective\r\nagendas. Finally, it has been made clear that the Assembly\r\nwould wish me to pursue the effort of my predecessors to\r\nrevitalize the Assembly’s role under the Charter.\r\nI have already begun consultations, through the\r\nchairmen of all regional groups and other interested parties,\r\nwith a view to creating - or, in some cases, reviving - as\r\nquickly as possible machinery which would allow necessary\r\nand urgent follow-up in these several areas of interest. All\r\nworking groups thus established would be open-ended and\r\ntransparent in their operations, while tasked at the same time\r\nto complete their mandates expeditiously. I hope within a\r\nfew days to be in a position to make a further announcement\r\nin this connection.\r\nIt would be a pity, I believe, if, as has been the case\r\nover the years, the high level of political will demonstrated\r\nin the general debate were to be allowed to evaporate\r\nwithout infusing more detailed consideration of issues at the\r\nlevel of the various subject Committees. The Committees\r\nand working groups should bear in mind the main ideas and\r\nrecommendations which we have been privileged to hear\r\nduring this debate and should seek to implement them\r\nwherever feasible.\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 11\r\nI would be less than candid here were I not to\r\nconfess to some disappointment that, despite my occasional\r\nreminders to the Assembly of the need to respect its own\r\ndecision to refrain from expressing congratulations to\r\nspeakers in the Hall and thus to make the most efficient use\r\nof its time, my pleas went largely unheeded. Also less than\r\nsatisfactory was the punctuality record. Admittedly, because\r\nof protocol requirements dictated by the attendance of many\r\nHeads of State and Government and other high-level\r\nrepresentatives, I was myself, on occasion, failing in this\r\nregard. However, now that the debate is over and the\r\nplenary Assembly is about to address substantive issues on\r\nthe Assembly’s agenda, I intend to insist on the full\r\nobservance of our accepted rules of procedure. May I\r\ntherefore urge the membership, at this time when our\r\nOrganization’s resources are scarce, to demonstrate a\r\nheightened sense of responsibility in the conduct of our\r\ndeliberations.\r\nOver the past two and a half weeks we have heard\r\naddresses from 28 Heads of State, 13 Prime Ministers,\r\n2 Crown Princes and 122 Foreign Ministers, among others.\r\nDespite this record number of statements - a total of 175, I\r\nam told - our debate ended on the day scheduled. With\r\nrepresentatives’ cooperation, we can also complete the\r\nprogramme ahead within the time allotted.\r\nFinally, may I express the hope - indeed, my\r\nexpectation - that deliberations in Committees and statements\r\nin plenary meetings to come will, like the general debate,\r\nrise to the level of events and of our aspirations to peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nI wish to thank everyone in the Secretariat, including\r\nour conference services and the interpreters - for the very\r\nready and unstinting cooperation we have received.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 9?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nPROGRAMME OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to remind\r\nrepresentatives that the debate on the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization is scheduled for\r\ntomorrow morning, and there are now 13 names inscribed on\r\nthe list of speakers. I wish to point out that that number of\r\nspeakers will not quite fill a three-hour meeting, that is to\r\nsay, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. A full meeting has been\r\nallocated to this debate because of members’ concern, as\r\nexpressed in resolution 47/233 of 17 August 1993, that the\r\nreports of principal organs should be discussed in depth by\r\nthe Assembly. However, the whole purpose of such a\r\ndecision would be defeated if only a few representatives\r\nspoke. This is especially true in the case of the\r\ndebate on the report of the International Court of Justice, for\r\nwhich, up to now, only two speakers have inscribed their\r\nnames on the list.\r\nWe cannot decide on one way and act another.\r\nAllow me therefore to remind Member States that the list of\r\nspeakers for those items is open. I invite them to follow up\r\nour resolutions with appropriate action in the debates in the\r\nplenary Assembly.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 150\r\nOBSERVER STATUS FOR THE ECONOMIC\r\nCOOPERATION ORGANIZATION IN THE GENERAL\r\nASSEMBLY: DRAFT RESOLUTION A/48/L.l\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on the representative of\r\nPakistan to introduce draft resolution A/48/L.1, concerning\r\nagenda item 150.\r\nMr. MARKER (Pakistan): I have the honour, on\r\nbehalf of the sponsors - Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan,\r\nTajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/48/L.1, on the granting of\r\nObserver status for the Economic Cooperation Organization\r\nin the General Assembly. I should like to state that this\r\ndraft resolution has been sponsored also by Senegal.\r\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) is an\r\nintergovernmental organization which was established in\r\n1985 when its predecessor organization, the Regional\r\nCooperation for Development, was restructured and\r\nrevitalized. Its founding members are the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Turkey. The\r\nmembership of this organization has since expanded to\r\ninclude seven other members of the region and it now stands\r\nat 10. The new members of the organization are the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan, the Azerbaijani Republic, the Republic\r\nof Kazakhstan, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of\r\nTajikistan, Turkmenistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan.\r\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization has the\r\nfollowing objectives: (a) to expand trade among member\r\nStates by providing free access to each other’s markets; (b)\r\nto promote in each member State conditions for sustained\r\neconomic growth in order to achieve continuous\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nimprovement in the standard of living of the people; (c) to\r\nconsolidate cultural affinities and spiritual and fraternal ties\r\nthat bind the people of the member States through social and\r\ncultural channels of thought and action; and (d) to\r\ncontribute to the growth of world trade and to strive to\r\nremove any iniquitous trading policies resulting in adverse\r\nterms of trade for the developing countries, by evolving a\r\ncommon approach in international forums.\r\nThe activities of the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization are conducted through eight technical\r\ncommittees, which consider and evolve projects and\r\nprogrammes of mutual benefit in the fields of economic and\r\ncommercial cooperation, transport and communications,\r\nagriculture, engineering, infrastructure and public works,\r\nnarcotics-abuse control, educational, scientific and cultural\r\nmatters.\r\nA protocol of preferential tariff arrangements\r\ninvolving a 10 per cent reduction has already been signed as\r\na first step towards the eventual elimination of trade barriers\r\nin the region.\r\nThe member States of the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization are convinced that, as a regional organization\r\nrepresenting 10 members, ECO will benefit greatly by\r\nhaving Observer status with the United Nations and that it\r\nwill also make a positive collective contribution to the\r\nactivities of the United Nations.\r\nI have the honour to request that the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization be granted Observer status to the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations, on terms similar to\r\nthose that have been prescribed in respect of other regional\r\nassociations of States. The members of the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization would greatly appreciate the\r\nsupport of the members of the General Assembly.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/48/L.l. May I take it that the\r\nAssembly wishes to adopt the draft resolution by consensus?\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.l was adopted (resolution\r\n48/2).\r\nThe PRESIDENT: In accordance with the\r\nresolution just adopted I now call on the Secretary-General\r\nof the Economic Cooperation Organization, Mr. Shamshad\r\nAhmad.\r\nMr. AHMAD (Economic Cooperation Organization\r\n(ECO)): I deem it a great privilege and an honour to\r\nrepresent the Economic Cooperation Organization at the\r\nforty-eighth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMay I at the outset extend to you, Sir, my sincere\r\nfelicitations on your assumption of the presidency of the\r\nAssembly at this session. We are confident that under your\r\nstewardship this session is assured of a successful and\r\npositive outcome, which will no doubt reinforce the role of\r\nthe United Nations and its resolve in facing the persistent\r\nand emerging challenges in the world.\r\nI should like to extend special thanks and\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedicated efforts and\r\ntireless endeavours to promote the aims and objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations. His report \"An Agenda for Peace\" is\r\nespecially commendable for it constitutes an important\r\ninitiative towards global stability, which will no doubt be\r\nconducive to efforts to promote the economic progress and\r\nwell-being of all nations and regions.\r\nThis session is taking place in the wake of profound\r\nchanges on the international and regional scenes. While the\r\nconfrontations of the past are receding, many new economic\r\nand political imperatives have arisen which demand new\r\napproaches in the outlooks of States and organizations.\r\nToday we are witnessing a renewed focus on multilateral\r\ncooperation for addressing both political and economic\r\nissues.\r\nMy presence at this session is motivated by the need\r\nfor us to forge closer cooperation between our two\r\norganizations, which share common interests and ideals. As\r\nrepresentatives are aware, ECO is purely an economic\r\norganization seeking to promote multifaceted regional\r\ncooperation as a solid base for sustained socio-economic\r\ngrowth of its member States.\r\nIts recent expansion from 3 to 10 full members\r\nmakes ECO a major regional grouping and an important\r\ninternational entity with vast combined potential in terms of\r\nmaterial and human resources.\r\nEncompassing a huge land mass of over 7 million\r\nsquare kilometres, inhabited by nearly 300 million people,\r\nECO assumes a special role, not only in the revival of old\r\ncultural and emotional links between the proud inheritors of\r\na common historical legacy, but also for addressing the\r\nimperatives of the future.\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 13\r\nTo best accomplish its objectives as stipulated in its\r\ncharter, the Treaty of Izmir, the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization is seeking to establish cooperative linkages\r\nwith various international organizations. Our quest begins,\r\nnaturally, with the best-established and most prestigious, the\r\nUnited Nations. I am pleased to announce in this forum that\r\nthe ECO attaches the utmost importance to developing a\r\ncooperative relationship with the United Nations and is keen\r\nto benefit from the experience of its relevant bodies,\r\nespecially in the economic field.\r\nWe are happy and gratified at the adoption of the\r\nresolution giving ECO observer status with the United\r\nNations. On behalf of the members of our organization, I\r\nwish to thank the Members of the United Nations for\r\nunanimously endorsing the resolution. We are confident that\r\nthe grant of observer status to ECO in the General Assembly\r\nwill facilitate the development of a productive working\r\nrelationship between the two organizations, focusing on the\r\nsocioeconomic welfare of our region.\r\nECO has recently launched two important action\r\nplans, namely the Quetta plan of action and the Istanbul\r\ndeclaration on ECO’s long-term prospects. These documents\r\nenvisage several specific projects in vital areas of\r\ndevelopment activities such as transport and\r\ncommunications, trade and energy. In the implementation of\r\nthese projects, ECO’s efforts would in fact complement the\r\neconomic development programmes of the United Nations\r\nand those of its subsidiary bodies in the ECO region.\r\nWe have already been in contact with various United\r\nNations agencies and have established cooperative\r\nrelationships with the Economic and Social Commission for\r\nAsia and the Pacific, the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization, and the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations, which have active\r\nprogrammes in the ECO region. We are also in contact with\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund on establishing a similar\r\nrelationship. We should be happy to enter into similar\r\ncooperative linkages with other United Nations agencies in\r\norder to benefit from their programmes. These cooperative\r\nlinkages with United Nations bodies would beyond a doubt\r\npave the way for exploiting the countless opportunities and\r\nthe combined potential offered by our region’s vast material\r\nand human resources.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish you, Mr. President, every\r\nsuccess for the deliberations of this session.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I take it that it is the wish\r\nof the Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n150?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 153\r\nOBSERVER STATUS FOR THE PERMANENT\r\nCOURT OF ARBITRATION IN THE GENERAL\r\nASSEMBLY: DRAFT RESOLUTION A/48/L.4\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on the representative of\r\nthe Netherlands to introduce draft resolution A/48/L.4.\r\nMr. BIEGMAN (Netherlands): The Permanent Court\r\nof Arbitration is the oldest intergovernmental institution in\r\nexistence that is dedicated to the task of resolving disputes\r\nbetween States. It was established in 1899 by the first\r\nHague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International\r\nDisputes. Since it has its seat in The Hague, in the Peace\r\nPalace, the honour of introducing the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/48/L.4 rests with the Netherlands\r\ndelegation. I am doing so now also on behalf of the almost\r\n50 countries that had already decided to join in sponsoring\r\nthe draft resolution, and of the other 10 that have since\r\ndecided to join, namely, Albania, Burkina Faso, Cameroon,\r\nColombia, Cuba, Cyprus, Kyrgyzstan, Senegal, Suriname and\r\nUkraine.\r\nMr. Musuka (Zambia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe draft resolution is a short one. It contains only\r\ntwo operative paragraphs: after having noted the desire of\r\nthe Permanent Court of Arbitration to intensify its\r\ncooperation with the United Nations, the General Assembly\r\nwould decide to invite the Permanent Court of Arbitration to\r\nparticipate in the sessions and the work of the General\r\nAssembly in the capacity of Observer and would request the\r\nSecretary-General to take the necessary action to implement\r\nthe resolution.\r\nAs stated in the explanatory memorandum annexed\r\nto the request to include the present item in our agenda, the\r\ncreation of a permanent institutional relationship between the\r\nPermanent Court of Arbitration and the United Nations will\r\nenable both organizations to strengthen existing ties. This\r\nwould have several positive effects, one being that it would\r\nfacilitate the active participation of the International Bureau\r\nof the Permanent Court of Arbitration in meetings of the\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nUnited Nations that are engaged in the discussion of systems\r\nfor the peaceful settlement of international disputes, as well\r\nas in the development and implementation of the programme\r\nof the Decade of International Law.\r\nThe Court’s activities regarding the Decade of\r\nInternational Law arise, inter alia, from the fact that the\r\nconference of members of the Permanent Court of\r\nArbitration invited the Administrative Council of the Court\r\nto authorize its Secretary-General, in preparation for the\r\ncommemoration of the centenary of the First International\r\nPeace Conference, in 1999, to appoint a broadly based\r\nSteering Committee. The Committee will analyse the\r\nhistorical development and practical application of methods\r\nof dispute settlement, and will also make recommendations\r\nas to whether to revise the Hague Conventions and whether\r\nto improve the dispute-settlement procedures under the\r\nauspices of the Court. Experts from States in different\r\ngeographical areas, at different levels of economic\r\ndevelopment and with different legal systems will sit on the\r\nCommittee.\r\nMore generally speaking, observer status would, of\r\ncourse, enhance the ability of the Permanent Court of\r\nArbitration to intensify its cooperation with the United\r\nNations in all appropriate fields.\r\nThe Netherlands firmly hopes that the decision to\r\ngrant observer status to the Permanent Court of Arbitration\r\nwill be part of a continuing effort to strengthen the\r\ninternational system of peaceful settlement of disputes, and\r\nthat those countries not yet participating in the activities of\r\nthe Court will join it by adhering to the 1907 Hague\r\nConvention for the Pacific Settlement of International\r\nDisputes.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/48/L.4. May I take it that the\r\nAssembly decides to adopt the draft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.4 was adopted (resolution\r\n48/3).\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative\r\nof Belgium, representing the European Community and its\r\nmembers, for an explanation of position on the resolution\r\njust adopted. May I remind delegations that explanations of\r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. DEREYMAEKER (Belgium) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): First, Sir, permit me to express to the\r\nPermanent Court of Arbitration, on behalf of the European\r\nCommunity and its member States, our warm congratulations\r\non its having been granted observer status in the General\r\nAssembly. Its admission makes official, and consolidates,\r\nthe long-standing relationship between the United Nations -\r\nand even its predecessor, the League of Nations - and the\r\noldest inter-governmental organization with competence in\r\nthe realm of the peaceful settlement of disputes between\r\nStates.\r\nFor the European Community and its member States,\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes is a fundamental aspect\r\nof their understanding of international relations. One of the\r\nmajor objectives of the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law is to promote ways and means of\r\npeacefully settling disputes between States. The contribution\r\nof the Permanent Court of Arbitration to the Decade’s work\r\ncould therefore prove useful.\r\nWhen it unanimously adopted last year the\r\nprogramme for the activities for the second term (1993-\r\n1994) of the Decade, the General Assembly invited the Sixth\r\nCommittee to consider wider use of the Permanent Court of\r\nArbitration. It is undoubtedly in order to facilitate such\r\nrecourse to the Court that its Administrative Council last\r\nyear adopted a series of new optional rules of procedure\r\nrelating to the arbitration of disputes between States.\r\nThe European Community and its member States are\r\npleased at the prospect of seeing the Court take an active\r\nand structured part in the work of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Sixth Committee has already benefited from the\r\nexperience the Court has acquired during nearly a century of\r\nexistence. Indeed, at its forty-sixth and forty-seventh\r\nsessions the Committee decided to invite the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Court to speak on the theme of the United\r\nNations Decade of International Law, the end of which, in\r\n1999, will coincide with the centenary of the Court’s\r\ncreation. We listened with a great deal of interest to the\r\nstatements of the Secretary-General of the Court, and were\r\nable to learn of its activities and plans for the future.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have heard the last speaker\r\nin explanation of position.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 153?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 157\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 15\r\nOBSERVER STATUS FOR THE LATIN AMERICAN\r\nPARLIAMENT IN THE GENERAl ASSEMBLY:\r\nDRAFT RESOLUTION A/48/L.3\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly has before it a\r\ndraft resolution (A/48/L.3). I call on the representative of\r\nPanama to introduce the draft resolution.\r\nMr. AROSEMENA (Panama) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for me to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.3, by which the General Assembly would\r\ngrant observer status to the Latin American Parliament.\r\nThe Latin American Parliament was established on\r\n10 December 1964 in Lima, Peru, by the representatives of\r\na number of Parliaments of Latin America. The States\r\nwhich at that time comprised the Parliament agreed to\r\ninstitutionalize it by a Treaty, also signed in Lima on 16\r\nNovember 1987. Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia,\r\nCosta Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El\r\nSalvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua,\r\nPanama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela signed the\r\nTreaty on that date. The Treaty is now in force, having\r\nbeen ratified by eleven Latin American countries.\r\nThe Latin American Parliament has also been granted\r\nobserver status in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, at the\r\ninvitation of that body.\r\nThe Treaty of Lima describes the Latin American\r\nParliament as \"a regional, permanent, unicameral\r\norganization ...\" composed of \"the national Congresses or\r\nLegislative Assemblies of democratically constituted States\r\nParties ...\", represented by all-party delegations chosen by\r\ntheir respective Parliaments.\r\nIn accordance with international law, the Treaty\r\ngrants the Parliament a separate legal personality and the\r\nprivileges and immunities which international law grants to\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nThe Latin American Parliament, which is financed by\r\nassessments paid by the States Parties, has been sitting since\r\n1990 in São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nThe Parliament’s objectives include the following:\r\nfirst, to promote the integrated economic and social\r\ndevelopment of the Latin American community and to\r\nendeavour to achieve, as quickly as possible, the full\r\neconomic, political and cultural integration of its peoples;\r\nsecond, to defend the full enjoyment of freedom, social\r\njustice, economic independence and the exercise of\r\nrepresentative democracy, with strict adherence to the\r\nprinciples of non-intervention and the self-determination of\r\npeoples; third, to ensure strict respect for fundamental human\r\nrights and to see to it that they are not infringed in any Latin\r\nAmerican State in any way that damages human dignity;\r\nfourth, to fight for the abolition of all forms of colonialism,\r\nneo-colonialism, racism and any other form of discrimination\r\nin Latin America; fifth, to oppose imperialist action in Latin\r\nAmerica, recommending appropriate legal norms and\r\nstandards that allow Latin American peoples full exercise of\r\ntheir permanent sovereignty over their natural resources and\r\nthe better utilization and preservation of those resources;\r\nsixth, to promote international cooperation in order to\r\norchestrate and foster the harmonious development of the\r\nLatin American community for the common good; seventh,\r\nto contribute to the strengthening of peace, security and the\r\ninternational legal order and to promote world disarmament,\r\ndenouncing and combating the arms race and aggression by\r\nthose who uphold a policy based on the use of force, which\r\nare incompatible with the economic, social, cultural and\r\ntechnological development to which the peoples of Latin\r\nAmerica are entitled; eighth, to channel and support, on the\r\ninternational scene, the demands of the peoples of Latin\r\nAmerica regarding just recognition of their rights in the\r\nstruggle for the establishment of a new international\r\neconomic order; and, ninth, to uphold in every way possible\r\nthe strengthening of the Parliaments of Latin America in\r\norder to guarantee the constitutional and democratic life of\r\nthe States and to promote, by all means available and\r\nwithout prejudice to the principle of non-intervention, the re-\r\nestablishment of those Parliaments that have been dissolved.\r\nThe draft resolution being discussed today is\r\nsponsored by the following Latin American countries:\r\nArgentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,\r\nCuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador,\r\nGuatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and\r\nVenezuela. It also enjoys the sponsorship of Portugal and\r\nSpain, from which our own nationalities originated and\r\ncountries with which we maintain links of all kinds.\r\nThe Latin American Parliament is a regional\r\norganization ratified by 11 Latin American States that are\r\nalso Members of the United Nations, and these States\r\nbelieve that the Parliament would benefit considerably from\r\nbeing granted observer status in the United Nations and that\r\nit could contribute to the Organization’s activities in the\r\nfields and within the geographical area of its competence.\r\nMembers are no doubt aware that our multilateral\r\nOrganization could also benefit from this contact, since\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nParliaments are the source of national legislation and\r\napprove the budgetary appropriations of our countries.\r\nHence, the countries I have the honour to represent\r\nask that the Latin American Parliament be granted observer\r\nstatus in the General Assembly on terms similar to those that\r\nhave been prescribed in respect of other intergovernmental\r\norganizations already enjoying that status.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now proceed\r\nto consider draft resolution A/48/L.3.\r\nBefore calling on the representatives who wish to\r\nspeak in explanation of vote before the voting, may I remind\r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10\r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. ALONSO (Uruguay)(interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The delegation of Uruguay wishes to be added to\r\nthe list of sponsors of draft resolution A/48/L.3, under which\r\nobserver status in the General Assembly of the United\r\nNations would be granted to the Latin American Parliament.\r\nThe Latin American Parliament has played a very\r\nimportant role in consolidating democratic values in the\r\nfraternal countries that are part of the Latin American\r\ncommunity. In my capacity as a member of the Parliament\r\nof my own country, as a member of the Latin American\r\nParliament and as Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary\r\nCommission of the Common Market of the South\r\n(MERCOSUR) I should like to state from my own personal\r\nstandpoint what a pleasure it is for me to be able to\r\nparticipate in this extremely important decision.\r\nThrough this status the Latin American Parliament,\r\nand through it the parliamentarians of all its member States,\r\nwill strengthen their presence in all international forums that,\r\nlike the United Nations, seek to strengthen democratic\r\nsystems in the world.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/48/L.3.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt that\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.3 was adopted (resolution\r\n48/4).\r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I take it that it is the wish\r\nof the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 157?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 158\r\nOBSERVER STATUS FOR THE CONFERENCE ON\r\nSECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE IN\r\nTHE GENERAL ASSEMBLY: DRAFT RESOLUTION\r\nA/48/L.6\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative\r\nof Sweden to introduce draft resolution A/48/L.6.\r\nMr. OSVALD (Sweden): I have the honour, in my\r\ncapacity as representative of the Chairman-in-Office of the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),\r\nto introduce draft resolution A/48/L.6 on observer status for\r\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. San Marino and Tajikistan should be\r\nadded to the list of sponsors of the draft resolution.\r\nThe decision to apply for Observer status for the\r\nCSCE is supported by all participating States of the CSCE,\r\nincluding Switzerland and the Holy See, which maintain\r\npermanent observer missions at the Headquarters of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAt the Helsinki Summit in July 1992, the\r\nparticipating States of the CSCE declared their understanding\r\nthat the CSCE is a regional arrangement in the sense of\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter, and that as such it provides an\r\nimportant link between European and global security. At the\r\nStockholm meeting of the CSCE Council in December last\r\nyear it was decided that the practical implications of this\r\nunderstanding should be examined. One of the conclusions\r\nreached in this examination was that the CSCE should apply\r\nfor observer status in the General Assembly.\r\nWith a view to meeting the new challenges in the\r\nCSCE area, the CSCE is elaborating ways and means to\r\nstrengthen its function to maintain and promote international\r\npeace and security within its area of competence. This\r\nincludes instruments for early warning, conflict prevention\r\nand crisis management, as well as preventive diplomacy and\r\npeace-keeping.\r\nVarious types of CSCE long-term missions, focusing\r\non early warning and conflict prevention, have accordingly\r\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 17\r\nbeen initiated in areas of the former Yugoslavia as well as\r\nin Estonia, Latvia, the Republic of Moldova, Georgia and\r\nTajikistan. The CSCE also directs special efforts related to\r\nthe conflict in and around Nagorny-Karabakh. CSCE\r\nmissions are supervising the implementation of United\r\nNations sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\n(Serbia and Montenegro). The CSCE High Commissioner\r\non National Minorities also has activities in various parts of\r\nthe CSCE area.\r\nThe so-called human-dimension mechanisms and\r\ninstitutions of the CSCE are being used increasingly as a\r\nmajor basis for efforts in areas such as early warning and\r\nlong-term conflict prevention.\r\nIn all these efforts, close consultation and interaction\r\nwith the United Nations is of the utmost importance -\r\nimportance that is reflected in letters exchanged, in May this\r\nyear, between the Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nand the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs as Chairman\r\nof the CSCE Council. These letters concerned a framework\r\nfor cooperation and coordination between the United Nations\r\nSecretariat and the CSCE.\r\nRegional organizations and arrangements are playing\r\nan increasingly important role in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. I am therefore convinced\r\nthat the General Assembly will unanimously endorse the\r\nrequest of the CSCE to be invited to participate, as an\r\nobserver, in the work of the Assembly. The Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe will thus join other\r\nimportant regional organizations that have already been\r\ngranted this status.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/48/L.6.\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.6 was adopted (resolution\r\n48/5).\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on the representative of\r\nBelgium for an explanation of vote.\r\nMay I remind representatives that explanations of\r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. DEREYMAEKER (Belgium) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): I have great pleasure in conveying the\r\ncongratulations of the European Community and its member\r\nStates to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE), on which we have just conferred Observer\r\nstatus in the United Nations General Assembly.\r\nHeads of State and Government of the CSCE have\r\ndeclared that, in accordance with the terms of the Helsinki\r\nSummit of July 1992, they regard the CSCE as a regional\r\narrangement within the meaning of Chapter VIII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. This statement opens the way to\r\nincreased cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCSCE, the framework for which was set out last May in\r\nletters exchanged between the Chairman in office of the\r\nCSCE - Mrs. af Ugglas, the Foreign Minister of Sweden -\r\nand the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali. The granting to the CSCE of Observer status\r\nin the United Nations General Assembly merely illustrates\r\nthe desire for increased cooperation.\r\nDuring the course of the forty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we shall have an opportunity to return to\r\nvarious aspects of the question of cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I take it that it is the wish\r\nof the Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n158?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.25 p.m.\r\n"
