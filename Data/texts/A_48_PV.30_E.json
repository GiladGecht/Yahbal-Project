"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n30th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nThursday, 14 October 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nSTATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I wish to begin by thanking the\r\ndelegations that were present in the Hall at 10.05 a.m.\r\ntoday - that is, the delegations of Algeria, Barbados, Bolivia,\r\nBrazil, China, Cambodia, Finland, Liechtenstein, Moldova,\r\nthe Republic of Korea, Romania, the United Arab Emirates,\r\nthe United States and Zambia.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 127 (continued)\r\nS C A L E O F A S S E S S M E N T S F O R T H E\r\nAPPORTIONMENT OF THE EXPENSES OF THE\r\nUNITED NATIONS (A/48/414/Add.7)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to draw the General\r\nAssembly’s attention to document A/48/414/Add.7. In a\r\nletter contained in that document, the Secretary-General\r\ninforms me that since the issuance of his communications\r\ndated 21, 24, 27 and 29 September 1993 and 4, 6 and\r\n11 October 1993 the Dominican Republic has made the\r\npayment necessary to reduce its arrears below the amount\r\nspecified in Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note\r\nof that information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We must now wait for the\r\nrepresentatives whose names are on the list of speakers for\r\nthis morning to arrive. I would ask delegations to ensure\r\nthat, when their names are on the list of speakers, they be\r\nhere on time to address the Assembly.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 10\r\nREPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE\r\nWORK OF THE ORGANIZATION (A/48/1)\r\nMr. TAYLHARDAT (Venezuela) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): We consider the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the work of the Organization to be particularly important\r\nand relevant because it provides an overview of how we can\r\ngive effect to the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter in the present circumstances. The report\r\nidentifies critical factors and the relationship between those\r\nfactors, which, if fully understood, can help us make\r\nsignificant progress towards the achievement of the\r\nobjectives shared by the entire international community. We\r\nthank the Secretary-General for the well-thought-out way he\r\nhas described his conduct of his office and for highlighting\r\nsubjects on which we must take decisions and those on\r\nwhich he seeks our guidance.\r\nVenezuela fully shares the Secretary-General’s\r\nconviction that the Organization has been able to respond\r\ndecisively and creatively to the demands of today’s\r\ninternational society and to the pre-eminent values of peace,\r\ndemocracy and development that have arisen as the\r\nunquestioned unifying factors in political action by Member\r\nStates. As a founding country of the Organization,\r\nVenezuela shares this focus; these are the very values that\r\nunderlie our domestic political order and our international\r\nactivities.\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86885 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.30\r\n9 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nWe particularly welcome the report’s reiterated\r\nrecognition that, despite the interrelation of these three\r\nfactors - peace, democracy and development - and despite\r\nthe world-wide spread of their scope, the State and national\r\nsovereignty remain the cornerstones of the Organization’s\r\nability to take concerted, consensual action in all aspects of\r\nits broad purview.\r\nI wish to concentrate today on the Secretary-General’s\r\noverview of the Organization. When the Assembly or its\r\nMain Committees consider other agenda items, we will have\r\nthe opportunity to make more detailed comments on some of\r\nthe many other matters the report deals with.\r\nAlong with the Secretary-General, we consider that,\r\nfaced with a new range of responsibilities and, above all,\r\npotentialities for action, the Organization must give priority\r\nto re-evaluating itself so it can effectively adapt to new\r\ncircumstances. In our view, the Secretary-General was right\r\nto shoulder the responsibility of challenging the status quo\r\nand proposing areas of political, organizational and\r\nmanagement action to do so.\r\nAll Member States maintain an unflagging interest in\r\nthe \"Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). The \"Agenda\" is being\r\nput to the test in the numerous crises that have arisen over\r\nthe past year. The Secretary-General’s commitment to\r\nsubmit for our consideration an agenda for development,\r\nconceptually and operationally linked to the \"Agenda for\r\nPeace\" ensures that this fresh momentum will be all-\r\nencompassing and that the Organization will fulfil its duty to\r\ndeal with each and every aspect of its Charter mandate.\r\nAs the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Venezuela has\r\nnoted, we are convinced that we must work for a more\r\ndemocratic and more transparent Organization, in whose\r\ndecision-making all Member States unreservedly feel they\r\nare fully participating.\r\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security Council\r\nover the past two years, Venezuela had the opportunity to\r\nsee how useful the Security Council summit was; but we\r\nhave also seen the need to find ways of enhancing\r\ntransparency and openness in the Council’s work,\r\ndeliberations and decision-making. That process is under\r\nway; continuing it will broaden the Council’s political ambit.\r\nThe current procedures of the Council, given their present\r\nmodalities and the scope of Council decisions,\r\nunquestionably require greater participation and\r\nresponsibility by all Member States. Along with the process\r\nof reviewing the composition of the Council, this should\r\nachieve better balance and a greater sense of shared\r\nresponsibility with the General Assembly, for the benefit of\r\nthe entire Organization. We share the Secretary-General’s\r\nbelief that the needed reforms should be completed by the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThe very concept of threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity is evolving. New situations are now ripe for\r\ncollective action based on that concept. The newness of that\r\nconcept has given rise to numerous questions as to the best\r\nway to meet the new demands. The Organization has\r\nresponded with institutional instruments and, largely, with\r\nexisting procedures. We wonder whether, if this trend\r\ncontinues, it is advisable for ever-greater responsibilities to\r\nbe concentrated in the Security Council.\r\nIn our view, the link between the Security Council and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council suggested in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report should not simply be ignored. We think the\r\nsuggested relationship should be reversed. The Economic\r\nand Social Council should not draw the Security Council’s\r\nattention to economic and social crises in order for the latter\r\nto take preventive action. Such preventive action is the very\r\nessence of the responsibilities of the Organization and of the\r\nentire United Nations system in the economic and social\r\nfield. Nevertheless, we could explore a way for the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, when a crisis arises, to\r\ncontribute to the solution of the economic and social aspects\r\nof the crisis. Instead of adopting resolutions calling for\r\neconomic and humanitarian assistance, recommending the\r\nestablishment of voluntary funds, or promising action by the\r\nspecialized agencies, the Security Council could recommend\r\nor request that the Economic and Social Council study and\r\ndefine the modalities for providing such necessary assistance\r\nas is possible, in all areas of its competence. That would\r\nachieve a better and more effective functional relationship\r\nbetween those two main organs, along with the participation\r\nof a larger number of Member States in the critical matters\r\nbefore the Organization. Combined with the ongoing\r\nprocess of restructuring and revitalization, this could lead to\r\na more focused and active Economic and Social Council,\r\nfully involved in all items before the Organization. We\r\nshould also consider whether, given its current operational\r\nmechanisms, the Economic and Social Council is really in a\r\nposition to take on additional tasks. The Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal for a high-level intersessional mechanism is\r\nespecially relevant in this context.\r\nWe think that what is required, rather than a process of\r\ncentralizing decision-making, is a process of segmentation,\r\nin order to give proper and full participation to every forum\r\nat our disposal.\r\nThe comments concerning the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil are also relevant to the International Court of\r\n30th meeting - Thursday, 14 October l993 3\r\nJustice. We have seen how, in one situation addressed by\r\nthe Security Council, the Council performed its duties\r\nwithout awaiting the outcome of the legal process provided\r\nfor in an international convention. As was pointed out by\r\nthe Secretary-General, the International Court of Justice, as\r\na principal organ of the United Nations, must also perform\r\nits functions fully as \"an integral part of United Nations\r\npeace efforts\" (A/48/1, para. 64) when called upon to do so,\r\nand its activities should not be prejudiced or conditioned by\r\nthose of other bodies. Failing this, we would be fostering\r\nselectivity that would not be conducive to strengthening the\r\nmain legal body of the United Nations.\r\nWhile this is of concern when the interests of political\r\nand legal solutions overlap, it is less so when the\r\ninternational community attempts to develop a broader legal\r\nsystem to respond to the new situations confronting it. We\r\nhave seen, for example, that is has been necessary to\r\nestablish a special Tribunal to pass judgement on serious\r\nviolations of international human rights committed in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia and that, for a few years now, there has\r\nbeen a proposal to create an international penal court. While\r\nthe Secretary-General’s concern to preserve the concept of\r\na single and universal legal system may be reasonable, it is\r\ncertain that reality extends beyond that desideratum. It\r\nwould be worth while in the immediate future for Member\r\nStates, with the Secretary-General’s support, to consider at\r\ngreater length and in greater detail the implications of the\r\ntrends to which he calls our attention in his report.\r\nFinally, in this attempt to respond to the ideas on\r\nUnited Nations bodies contained in the report, I should like\r\nto refer briefly to the Secretariat. Venezuela supports and\r\ngenerally welcomes the Secretary-General’s initiatives aimed\r\nat improving the quality and commitment of the\r\nOrganization’s staff, rationalizing its structures to meet new\r\ndemands, correcting the misuse of funds and reducing waste.\r\nWe simply wish to point out that, as in any organization that\r\nattempts to answer to the most varied interests, this process\r\nwould gain support if it was carried out consensually, first\r\naddressing the need to fulfil the existing mandates and in\r\nconsultation with Member States.\r\nThe challenge before us is not only one of\r\nrationalization and increased efficiency: we also need to feel\r\nthat we are playing an active part in a process that also\r\ninvolves the Secretary-General, the individual Member\r\nStates, and the United Nations bodies through which the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter are expressed.\r\nMr. INDERFURTH (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States is pleased to have this opportunity to express\r\nagain its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his\r\nstewardship of the United Nations during what must surely\r\nbe one of the most demanding years in the history of this\r\nOrganization. The story of the sweep and scale of these 12\r\nmonths is amply told in the comprehensive report before us\r\ntoday.\r\nWhile many important themes are addressed, we will\r\nlimit our comments to a few practical issues of particular\r\nimportance and consequence: peace-related activities, the\r\nmatter of interim United Nations offices, and the\r\nstrengthening of United Nations activities in human rights,\r\nhumanitarian affairs and development.\r\nFirst, in the section entitled \"Peace-keeping in a\r\nchanging context\", we welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nseveral timely and important proposals for strengthening\r\nmanagement and support of the widening range of peace-\r\nrelated activities. Let me draw the attention of members of\r\nthe Assembly to some of these.\r\nFirst, we agree that robust and professional press and\r\npublic-information activities are an integral part of peace-\r\nkeeping. We welcome the attention this dimension of peace-\r\nkeeping receives in the report and encourage the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to take measures to strengthen it.\r\nSecondly, we like the emphasis on improved training\r\nand civilian recruitment for peace-keeping missions and\r\nbelieve that aggressive steps in these areas should be made\r\na very high priority.\r\nThirdly, we strongly endorse the proposal that the\r\nGeneral Assembly create a system for appropriating, on an\r\naccelerated basis, some portion of the estimated cost of a\r\npeace-keeping operation, and we hope that the Fifth\r\nCommittee will soon be able to turn its attention to this\r\nimportant issue.\r\nFourthly, we note that the United Nations has begun to\r\nmake use of the services of commercial contractors to\r\nprovide support services for United Nations field operations.\r\nSo long as these contracts cover non-sensitive activities and\r\nare awarded on a competitive basis - open to bids from\r\ncompanies in all geographical regions - we believe they are\r\na sound and appropriate response to rapidly growing\r\ndemands.\r\nFinally, we strongly welcome the incorporation of the\r\nField Operations Division into the Department of Peace-\r\nkeeping Operations and expect this change to strengthen\r\nsignificantly the Department’s executive authority for peace-\r\nkeeping operations under the direction of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nTurning to the economic and social sphere, another area\r\nof interest to the United States is the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal for the establishment of integrated offices in the\r\nnewly independent States as well as in other locations. In\r\ngeneral, the United States looks with favour on the principle\r\nunderlying the Secretary-General’s proposal. The\r\nimprovement of coordination and the introduction of greater\r\nefficiency in United Nations system operations is a goal\r\nwhich the United States has long pursued throughout the\r\nentire range of intergovernmental forums. However, we\r\nbelieve that the proposal requires more analysis, input and\r\ndiscussion in order to ensure that the mechanisms which are\r\nset up perform efficiently and synergistically with the goals\r\nand objectives of United Nations agencies.\r\nOn development issues, the United States looks forward\r\nwith interest to the proposals that the Secretary-General\r\nindicates will be forthcoming in his report \"An agenda for\r\ndevelopment\"; a preliminary report on the subject will be\r\nmade available to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession. We are pleased that, in his report on the work of\r\nthe Organization, the Secretary-General indicated that his\r\nreport will include guidelines for future United Nations\r\naction. The United States hopes that the report will help\r\nstimulate a more pragmatic discussion and work programme\r\nfor furthering development.\r\nRegarding the treatment of human rights in the report,\r\nwe were gratified to read that \"the effective safeguarding of\r\nhuman rights is possible only in a democratic framework\"\r\n(A/48/1, para. 275) and that \"the process of democratization\r\ncannot be separated from the protection of human rights\"\r\n(ibid.). As President Clinton stated before this body during\r\nthe general debate:\r\n\"Our overriding purpose must be to expand and\r\nstrengthen the world’s community of market-based\r\ndemocracies.\" (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-eighth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n4th meeting, p. 27)\r\nWe are therefore in harmony with the Secretary-General. In\r\naddition, we believe that strengthening the role that the\r\nUnited Nations plays in human rights is an important goal\r\nfor this Organization. This can best be accomplished\r\nthrough the creation of a post of high commissioner for\r\nhuman rights, and we hope to work with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to that end.\r\nMr. WISNUMURTI (Indonesia): It is a distinct honour\r\nand privilege for me to speak on behalf of the non-aligned\r\ncountries on the Secretary-General’s report on the work of\r\nthe Organization (A/48/1). It is comprehensive and provides\r\nus with an overall view of what the United Nations is doing\r\nand what it is called upon to do, as well as proposals to\r\nstrengthen its functioning and improve its efficiency.\r\nIndeed, it is more detailed than any that has been submitted\r\nin the past years, reflecting the enhanced stature and prestige\r\nof the Organization in various fields of its endeavour. The\r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries is greatly indebted to\r\nour Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\ndedicated leadership in guiding the work of the Organization.\r\nThe past few years have witnessed a dramatic\r\nimprovement in the climate in which the United Nations has\r\nfunctioned. The Secretary-General has rightly identified the\r\ncomprehensive nature of the global challenges over the past\r\nyear and thus the indispensability of the United Nations in\r\naddressing them. Such global challenges require an\r\nintegrated approach to peace, security and development.\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" and an agenda for development, now\r\nat the preparatory stage, underscore the comprehensiveness\r\nand integrated nature of the new approach being enunciated\r\nby the Secretary-General. We fully agree that, given these\r\nchallenges and the realities of our time, it is clear that this\r\nworld Organization - the United Nations - has indeed\r\nbecome indispensable.\r\nIn the areas of peace and security, the United Nations\r\nrole has been revitalized and rejuvenated, and within a short\r\nperiod of time the Organization has amassed a record of\r\nsignificant achievements. Peace-keeping and peacemaking\r\nactivities launched in many areas of the world have gained\r\nnew dimensions of unprecedented variety and scope. We\r\nagree that there is a second generation of peace-keeping\r\ninvolving political, military and humanitarian aspects, and\r\nthat these should be dealt with in a unified and integrated\r\nmanner. However, the Movement believes that these\r\nactivities should be pursued in a balanced manner and\r\naccord fully with the sacrosanct principles that the\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of\r\nStates should not be infringed.\r\nLikewise, we concur with the Secretary-General’s\r\nassessment that development is now understood to involve\r\nmany dimensions. No longer merely confined to economic\r\npolicies and resources, it also includes political, social,\r\neducational and environmental factors.\r\nThe end of the cold war and the disappearance of\r\nideological rigidities have also impacted on the role of the\r\nOrganization in the economic and social fields. In a number\r\nof other areas, ranging from the environment to population,\r\nthe United Nations is also in the forefront of international\r\nefforts to manage transition and change.\r\n30th meeting - Thursday, 14 October l993 5\r\nHowever, as the Secretary-General’s report makes clear,\r\nthe post-cold-war era has not brought with it the termination\r\nof all conflict situations, as many continue unabated with no\r\nresolution in sight. Likewise, in spite of a climate more\r\nconducive to serious discussion and negotiation of economic\r\nand social issues, no substantive progress can be cited.\r\nIndeed, the heightened perception that the United Nations\r\nhas become indispensable is not matched by the availability\r\nof adequate resources for the new opportunities offered by\r\nthe post-cold-war period or the rapid transformation now\r\nunder way in the global economy.\r\nIt is therefore with deepening concern that we view the\r\nfinancial crisis now facing the Organization. For while the\r\nOrganization is staggering under the unprecedented\r\nexpectation that it should deal effectively with a multiplicity\r\nof complex problems, it is being shackled by this perennial\r\ncrisis. This paradox between demands and capacity cannot\r\ncontinue indefinitely without disastrous consequences for the\r\naspirations of the international community for peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe non-aligned countries believe that the United\r\nNations should become effective as the central and\r\nirreplaceable instrument for a new and revitalized\r\ninternational order. In these endeavours, the primary\r\nobjective is to render the Organization more responsive to\r\nthe changing realities and emerging challenges of peace and\r\ndevelopment. Hence, steps must be taken to ensure not only\r\nthe financial viability of the Organization, but also its\r\ndemocratic functioning - that is, the fullest participation,\r\nconsultation and engagement of all its Members in the work\r\nof the Organization. In this context, we are gratified to note\r\nin the report that the General Assembly is playing an\r\nincreasingly practical role in world activities. As the\r\nGeneral Assembly has grown in membership, its expanded\r\nactivities include addressing issues relating to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Clearly,\r\nthere is also a need for streamlining and revitalizing the\r\nwork of the Assembly. Through such an approach, the\r\nAssembly could more clearly define its work programme and\r\nimpart greater importance and authority to its decisions.\r\nAt the same time, the non-aligned countries are\r\ncommitted to establishing a balanced relationship between\r\nthe General Assembly and other principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations. In this context, it is essential to ensure the\r\ndemocratization of the Security Council, in line with the\r\nreform of the United Nations aimed at bringing about greater\r\ndemocratization and transparency in the work of all United\r\nNations bodies. A review of the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil has become imperative in the light of the profound\r\nchanges that have taken place on the international scene.\r\nSuch a reappraisal should be comprehensive in nature so as\r\nto enhance its effectiveness and credibility, provide equitable\r\nand balanced representation and facilitate the participation of\r\nsmall and medium-sized States, which constitute the majority\r\nof the Organization. We hope that a decision concerning the\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council will be reached prior to\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Organization. Furthermore, we\r\nalso endorse the proposal for periodic meetings of the\r\nCouncil at the ministerial level. In this context, while we\r\nwelcome the observation of the Secretary-General that\r\nmembership is of critical importance, it is equally critical\r\nthat other aspects relating to the functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil be fully acknowledged.\r\nAs to the Economic and Social Council, we agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General that the Council must now receive\r\ngreater attention than it did during the cold war. We want\r\neven more to see the Council function fully, in accordance\r\nwith its mandate enshrined in the Charter. Yet we note with\r\nregret the failure at the forty-seventh session of the\r\nAssembly to reach consensus on restructuring the United\r\nNations in the economic, social and related fields. On the\r\nquestion of the Economic and Social Council’s providing the\r\nSecurity Council with reports on certain situations that\r\nthreaten peace, we believe that such a practice would run\r\ncounter to the Non-Aligned Movement’s position on the\r\nneed to achieve a balanced relationship between the principal\r\norgans of the United Nations.\r\nPeace-keeping activities are now being utilized in\r\nhistorically unprecedented ways. Consequently, the\r\nuncertainty and discord concerning the composition,\r\ncommand and control, financing, mandate and time-frame of\r\npeace-keeping operations, as well as the safety of their\r\npersonnel, have often impeded their effectiveness. It is\r\nimportant to search for ways and means in which consensus\r\ncould be built to ensure global support for these activities.\r\nTo this end, the roles of the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Secretary-General will require a careful\r\nreassessment.\r\nThe non-aligned countries are gratified to note that, in\r\nthe context of restricting and resolving conflict situations, the\r\nSecretary-General has undertaken numerous initiatives and\r\nactions which have established a framework to facilitate a\r\npeaceful settlement in accordance with relevant resolutions.\r\nThe Movement will resolutely support his endeavours to\r\nenhance the efficacy of preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping\r\nand peacemaking operations, in which many non-aligned\r\ncountries have served and will continue to serve.\r\nIn the economic sphere, the report contains a number of\r\ninteresting and important ideas, notably on the concept of\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ndevelopment. Of particular importance to the Movement is\r\nthat the vast potential of the Organization is being brought\r\nto bear in a new and refreshing way on the need for\r\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty. At its Jakarta\r\nSummit, the Movement succeeded in putting development\r\nand the eradication of poverty back at the top of its agenda\r\nas a central imperative of this new post-cold-war era. We\r\ntherefore enthusiastically anticipate the forthcoming report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the agenda for development as a\r\nwatershed in international cooperation for development. The\r\nNon-Aligned Movement hopes that with this report\r\ndevelopment will finally be accorded as much emphasis as\r\nis given to the political agenda.\r\nIn the view of the Secretary-General, the Organization’s\r\nwork in the economic and social fields appears to be less\r\nfocused than its work in the political sector, due to the\r\nproliferation of intergovernmental bodies in those sectors and\r\ntheir lack of coordination. While this may be true, we\r\nshould not discount the lack of political will in the equation.\r\nIn any efforts to increase coordination, the new orientation\r\nand focus on development should not be ignored. In this\r\ncontext, it is pertinent to state that any structural changes to\r\nbe undertaken by the Secretary-General should be subject to\r\napproval by the relevant intergovernmental bodies.\r\nWe in the Non-Aligned Movement are also pleased that\r\nthe Secretary-General has dealt deftly and cogently with the\r\nconceptual aspects of the changing world realities as they\r\nrelate to development and its interlinkages with peace,\r\nstability and democracy. We see the contours of such a\r\nconcept emerging. At its Summit last year, our Movement\r\ncommitted itself to wage war on poverty, illiteracy and\r\nunderdevelopment and to advance broad-based\r\npeople-centred development, including the promotion of\r\nhuman resources for development. It also sought to\r\naccelerate development based on equitable distribution,\r\ngrowth and stability. The Movement can therefore agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General’s assertion that there can be no\r\nflowering of development without the parallel advancement\r\nof democratization, especially over the long term. It is\r\nimportant to point out, however, that democracy, like\r\ndevelopment, is an evolutionary process and can best grow\r\nand flourish by being nurtured gradually in keeping with a\r\ncountry’s norms and traditions. There is no single formula\r\nfor democracy applicable to all countries, as we fully\r\nrecognize the existence of economic, social and cultural\r\ndifferences.\r\nAs emphasized in the report, there is also a need for\r\ndemocratization between countries. Yet, in the section on\r\ndeveloping the global community, the Secretary-General\r\npointed to the shocking fact, as he put it, that the widening\r\ngap between the richest and poorest countries was more\r\noften than not greeted by indifference. As the United\r\nNations has a pivotal role in bridging this gap, we look\r\nforward to the fulfilment of the Secretary-General’s promise\r\nto set out fully the United Nations approach to development\r\nin an agenda for development. The Movement fully\r\nsupports this initiative and is fully committed to participating\r\nin the forthcoming discussions on the preliminary report\r\nbefore the end of the forty-eighth session.\r\nIn like manner, in addressing the widening gap and the\r\nunacceptable trends in the world economy and global\r\neconomic relations, as well as in recognizing the growing\r\ninterdependence of nations and the globalization of issues\r\nand problems, the Non-Aligned Movement is very much\r\naware that piecemeal and ad hoc remedies are not the\r\nanswer. Unilateral, bilateral or regional approaches are not\r\nadequate either. Rather, such issues must be\r\ncomprehensively and globally addressed. Thus the\r\nMovement saw no alternative to generating international\r\ncooperation for development, and has in consequence called\r\nfor a reactivation of the dialogue and partnership between\r\nNorth and South. This time, however, the Movement sees\r\nthe dialogue as being based on the economic imperatives of\r\nmutual interests and benefits, genuine interdependence and\r\nshared responsibility. We thus see the dialogue and the\r\nagenda for development as complementary and compatible;\r\ntogether they can enable the international community to\r\ncome to terms with the fundamental questions of overcoming\r\nunderdevelopment and poverty in developing countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nRegarding the social issues covered in the report, the\r\nnon-aligned countries welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nintegrated approach in addressing economic and social\r\ndevelopment issues, as well as the progress already made in\r\nthe preparations for the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. We look forward to the completion of the\r\npreparatory studies for the conference, which are under way,\r\nand to the definition of attainable social development\r\nobjectives.\r\nOn the advancement of women, we appreciate the\r\nSecretary-General’s work in outlining a number of steps\r\nbeing taken to give greater coherence to the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations, and we hope that this will contribute to the\r\nsuccess of the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women.\r\nFinally, with regard to the outcome of the World\r\nConference on Human Rights, held in Vienna, the report has\r\nrightly highlighted the importance of the need for\r\ncooperation between Member States as a central element in\r\nfurthering these goals. In this regard, the Movement notes\r\n30th meeting - Thursday, 14 October l993 7\r\nwith satisfaction that the report stressed the right to\r\ndevelopment and the need for an effective partnership of all\r\nthose concerned in order to promote those goals.\r\nIn the present global setting, mutual interaction and\r\nlinkages between political and economic problems are\r\nself-evident. In an increasingly interdependent world, the\r\npolitical stability and economic well-being of both developed\r\nand developing countries has become more intertwined. As\r\nthe problems we face assume global proportions, in their\r\nscope and in their consequences, they call for a globalized\r\neffort to find solutions. The emergence of a new, more\r\nequitable and rational world order can come about only\r\nthrough sustained international cooperation and dialogue,\r\nconducted within a coherent, integrated and comprehensive\r\napproach as called for by the Secretary-General.\r\nMr. REMÍREZ DE ESTENOZ (Cuba) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): My delegation is pleased that we are having\r\nthis debate on the report of the Secretary-General, thus\r\nresuming the healthy practice of considering annually in the\r\nGeneral Assembly a document whose contents generally go\r\nbeyond reviewing the activities of the Organization in the\r\npast year to outlining the future work of the United Nations.\r\nUnfortunately, in a debate such as this it is not possible\r\nto consider in depth every aspect of the report. Therefore,\r\nwe shall focus on its general approach and on some of the\r\nelements which my delegation feels are the most important.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in the introduction to his report,\r\nrecognizes that\r\n\"States and their sovereignty are ... indispensable\r\nbuilding-blocks of international order and problem-\r\nsolving\" (A/48/1, para. 13)\r\nand he confirms that \"the State and its national sovereignty\"\r\n(ibid., para. 14) are the essential link between the isolated\r\nindividual and the increasingly complex world in which he\r\nfinds himself. He also points out:\r\n\"Without State sovereignty, the very instrument of\r\ninternational cooperation might be destroyed and\r\ninternational organization might itself become\r\nimpossible\". (ibid., para. 16)\r\nEarlier in his report, the Secretary-General makes it\r\nclear that, in his estimation,\r\n\"democratization must not only take hold inside a State,\r\nbut among States in the international community\".\r\n(ibid., para. 10)\r\nSimilarly, he refers repeatedly in the introduction to the\r\nimportance of the problems of development and to the role\r\nour Organization must play in solving them. We fully agree\r\nwith the Secretary-General that development activities\r\n\"provide the foundations for global security and\r\nstability\". (ibid., para. 22)\r\nWe make specific mention of these concepts because\r\ntheir being in the introduction might well lead an unwary\r\nreader to believe that they are the cornerstone of the\r\ndocument as a whole and its philosophical basis.\r\nUnfortunately, there is little to inspire such hope.\r\nIt can be seen throughout the report - it is a constant -\r\nthat the problems of development of the third world, which\r\nare one of the main tragedies facing the contemporary world,\r\nhave in practice been subordinated to the implementation of\r\nnew concepts supposedly aimed at preserving international\r\npeace and security. The priorities have been changed, and\r\nin the report the necessary balance between peace-keeping\r\nand the duties of the United Nations with regard to\r\ninternational cooperation for development has been lost.\r\nIt is troubling to note that, in the efforts to implement\r\nthe so-called integrated approach of the United Nations - an\r\napproach based, according to the report, on peace and\r\nsecurity, democracy, human rights and development, in that\r\norder - not only does the integrated nature which supposedly\r\ngave its name to that approach disappear, but there is also\r\nan inversion in the pyramid which for decades we in the\r\ndeveloping countries have been demanding. Development\r\nand international cooperation to achieve development must\r\nbe the main concern of this Organization, and not other\r\nmechanisms, which - besides responding to very specific and\r\npartial interests - constitute a major potential for interference.\r\nSimilarly, with the anticipated order of priorities,\r\ncircumstances are being created for new conditions to\r\nemerge, a prelude to which we have already noted with\r\nconcern in various mechanisms in the Organization.\r\nThe unbridled proliferation of peace-keeping operations\r\nand the increased efforts to institute so-called preventive\r\ndiplomacy, with a costly early-warning system; the creation\r\nof a General Staff of the Organization, without even a\r\nspecific mandate to do so; and the new practices for\r\npeacemaking, imposing peace and post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding - to mention but a few of the new concepts - has\r\nled to the limited resources of the Organization being\r\nincreasingly dissipated.\r\nHas there perhaps been a proportional increase in\r\nresources devoted to cooperation for development? Has\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\npriority perhaps been given to those resources which\r\ncountless United Nations resolutions and declarations have\r\ndemanded for decades? Are those funds not perhaps going\r\nto programme and budgetary procedures for the sake of\r\nother activities?\r\nOn the contrary, the resources devoted to peace-keeping\r\noperations - which, moreover, we the States Members of the\r\nOrganization provide, imposing a heavy burden on the\r\nmarginalized South - are so abundant, and the prospects for\r\nmore such operations so ambitious, that they have induced\r\nthe Secretary-General to imply in his report that they exceed\r\nthe capacity of the Organization.\r\nBut, just as dangerous as the inversion of priorities to\r\nwhich we have referred, are their side effects in practically\r\nall spheres of the work of the Organization. We have noted\r\nwith concern that not only has the primacy of the Security\r\nCouncil - with all the structural defects in membership and\r\noperating procedures from which it suffers - been confirmed\r\nin the report, but there is also a reiteration of the appeal for\r\nstill further increases in the Council’s power, subordinating\r\nother principal bodies to its decisions. Paragraph 42, for\r\nexample, which in a mere proposal summarizes the\r\nphilosophy underlying this entire document, would\r\nsubordinate the role of the Economic and Social Council to\r\nthe Security Council, broaden the mandate of the Security\r\nCouncil to all spheres of United Nations activity, and be a\r\nfurther step towards the objective of transforming the\r\nSecurity Council into a sort of world government.\r\nThe fact that in paragraph 6 of the report it is affirmed\r\nthat\r\n\"The second generation of peace-keeping is certain to\r\ninvolve not only military but also political, economic,\r\nsocial, humanitarian and environmental dimensions\"\r\n(A/48/1, para. 6)\r\nappears to be heading in a similar direction, considering that\r\nit is the Security Council which is the organ entrusted with\r\nsuch operations.\r\nThe re-establishment of balance would necessarily\r\nimply that the General Assembly resume in practice the\r\nfunctions related to peace-keeping and the peaceful\r\nsettlement of controversies entrusted to it in the Charter.\r\nThe Secretary-General complains, in paragraph 22 of\r\nthe report, and quite rightly, that the attention of the media\r\nis focused on peace-keeping operations, giving the\r\nimpression that other aspects are being ignored. We have to\r\nwonder, first of all, whether the media are wrong. Could it\r\nperhaps be that the press has clearly seen the situation for\r\nwhat it is and that our Organization, on the basis of its new\r\nand questionable priorities, has given cause for such\r\nperceptions?\r\nThe Secretariat, to mention another example, also\r\nsuffers the side effects of the inversion of priorities. We\r\nneed only note the trend towards transferring personnel hired\r\nunder the regular budget of the Organization to peace-\r\nkeeping operations without replacing them. It is difficult for\r\nus to believe that the work of 1,200 employees of the\r\nSecretariat can be absorbed by others without adversely\r\naffecting the programmes of the Organization which are not\r\nrelated to peace-keeping operations and which have been\r\nduly mandated by the appropriate legislative bodies.\r\nThe delegations themselves - why not say it aloud? -\r\nare also made to suffer these effects. While it is true that\r\nthere are unpaid contributions, which diminish the resources\r\navailable to the Organization, it is also quite true that the\r\ncosts of carrying out certain activities, such as the\r\nestablishment of a General Staff, situations rooms and other\r\nmeasures whose legislative mandates are also very\r\nquestionable, absorb a great deal of resources which, in\r\npractice, could be devoted to satisfying needs in the areas of\r\ndocuments, interpretation and other services to delegations\r\nof the Member States, which are in reality the raison d’être\r\nof this Organization. Savings should be made elsewhere and\r\nnot at the expense of the delegations representing the\r\nMembers of the United Nations, as recognized in paragraph\r\n83 of the report. Perhaps the approach adopted in 1985 and\r\n1986, when certain circumstances reduced the financial\r\ncapacity of the Organization, would be a good precedent. At\r\nthat time, all of the measures to effect savings were taken in\r\nfull consultation with the General Assembly.\r\nThe fact that the States, and therefore the Governments\r\nthey represent, are at the very centre of the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations can be neither forgotten nor set aside when\r\nconsidering the future programmes and activities of the\r\nOrganization, in keeping, also, with the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of all States. This calls not only for\r\ndetermining philosophical, political and economic concepts,\r\nto which primacy should be given, but also means that\r\ndecisions as to the future course of the Organization must be\r\ntaken strictly by the relevant intergovernmental bodies and\r\nnot by other mechanisms not made up of Member States.\r\nIn this context, it is particularly important to recall that\r\nthe General Assembly is the principal body of the\r\nOrganization and that its decisions are not opinions of the\r\nMember States but, rather, mandates the Secretariat is\r\nobliged to carry out. The report contains numerous\r\n30th meeting - Thursday, 14 October l993 9\r\nexamples of how this reality is ignored. It is fitting to recall\r\nhere that the question of competence of the various bodies\r\nof the United Nations and of balance that must exist between\r\nthe main bodies is one of the current debates in our\r\nOrganization and, hence, we do not deem it appropriate for\r\npositions to be taken that might prejudge the decisions\r\nadopted by the various intergovernmental bodies, particularly\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nParagraph 80 of the report deserves special attention.\r\nIn our opinion, the establishment of the new post of\r\nAssistant Secretary-General for Inspections and\r\nInvestigations must be considered very closely. We feel that\r\nit would be more appropriate to strengthen internal controls,\r\nsuch as investigation, inspection, evaluation and accounting,\r\nbut the key to success in this task would be, in our view, to\r\nstrengthen the existing intergovernmental external control\r\nmechanisms. We shall expand on our comments in the\r\nappropriate forums, but we feel that in this area as well, the\r\nMember States should play a central role.\r\nThe points made in the section of the report dealing\r\nwith the restructuring of the Secretariat are of particular\r\ninterest. I refer especially to paragraphs 86 and 90. The\r\nGeneral Assembly awaits submission of the third stage in the\r\nrestructuring, which relates to regional decentralization and\r\nto decentralization in the field. We feel that measures in this\r\nconnection should not be pursued until approval has been\r\ngiven.\r\nAn obvious illustration of this is the explanation,\r\ncontained in paragraphs 102 to 106, of the so-called interim\r\noffices, about which there are many doubts among many\r\nMember States. These offices - which we feel are at the\r\nvery apex of the inverted pyramid that there is an attempt to\r\napply, on the basis of the concept of a more integrated\r\napproach in the work of the Organization - are unacceptable.\r\nThe broad gamut of functions dealt with goes far beyond\r\npreventive diplomacy and the compiling of information and\r\nincludes the coordination of activities in the field. In effect,\r\nthese functions are regarded as being those of an embassy of\r\nthe United Nations, for which there is no General Assembly\r\nmandate. We could discuss a coordinated presence in the\r\nfield, but exclusively for the functions to which General\r\nAssembly resolution 47/199 relates.\r\nSimilarly, we wonder what is the origin of the mandate\r\nof the Department for Economic and Social Information and\r\nPolicy Analysis, which, according to the report:\r\n\"will link its activities with the early-warning\r\ncapabilities being developed in the political and\r\nhumanitarian sectors of the Organization\". (A/48/1,\r\npara. 130)\r\nThe same applies to some of the functions which, according\r\nto paragraph 139, are assigned to the Department for\r\nDevelopment Support and Management Services.\r\nOne of the matters with which we feel the report should\r\ndeal in greater detail relates to the nature of peace-keeping\r\noperations, particularly in the light of paragraphs 276 to 278\r\nand paragraph 291, as they tend to alter the very concept of\r\nthese important activities. The attempt to question the\r\nprinciple of the consent of the parties for the initiation of\r\noperations seems to reflect the concept of limited\r\nsovereignty, which is very much in vogue in certain sectors,\r\nand which we feel contradicts the emphasis that the\r\nSecretary-General, in the introduction to his report, puts on\r\nsovereignty. We are firmly convinced that any United\r\nNations action within the framework of \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\" should adhere strictly to the decisions adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the subject and should conform to the\r\nbasic principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\r\nIt is also essential that those United Nations activities\r\nbe undertaken following a case-by-case analysis, without\r\ncreating precedents, as the circumstances in which these\r\nelements evolve are necessarily different. Therefore we\r\nnote, and we are concerned at, the assertion made in\r\nparagraph 282 of the report.\r\nIn view of all we have said, we should like to sound a\r\nwarning concerning the continued references, direct or\r\nindirect, to the assumption that at this stage it is the job of\r\nthe United Nations to get involved in situations that come\r\nexclusively within the jurisdiction of Member States.\r\nContinuing along that road could lead to unacceptable\r\ninterference and to violation of the sovereignty of Member\r\nStates - especially States in the third world.\r\nParagraphs 251 and 252, as well as paragraph 255, in\r\nchapter III D, which is entitled \"Protection of human rights\",\r\ncall for specific mention. In the case of the first two of\r\nthese paragraphs, we do not know what mandates have led\r\nto a change in the functions of the Centre for Human Rights\r\nand what procedures have been followed for that purpose.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation sent the Secretary-General a\r\nletter, which we hope has been made available to all\r\ndelegations. With regard to paragraph 255, the Vienna\r\nConference highlighted the universal nature of human rights\r\nbut, equally, made the point that these rights are indivisible,\r\ninterdependent and interlinked. We believe that partial or\r\nselective reference to international instruments of this kind\r\nmay well be counter-productive and may lead to confusion.\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nFurther, paragraph 262, on the same subject, derives\r\nfrom an interpretation of the results of the Vienna\r\nConference that we do not share. It should not be forgotten\r\nthat the introduction of the human rights dimension into\r\nUnited Nations activities concerning inter alia peacemaking,\r\npeace-keeping and preventive diplomacy - to mention but a\r\nfew areas - must only be invoked pursuant to a request from\r\nthe States involved in a conflict, and that such action cannot\r\nbe determined by any outside agency.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report contains so many\r\nimportant and interesting elements that it would take a much\r\nlonger and more comprehensive statement to mention all of\r\nthem. We should like to be able to comment, for example,\r\non the regional tribunals, or the specific items mentioned in\r\nparagraph 66, or the possibility - mentioned in paragraph 64\r\n- of the Secretary-General’s turning to the International\r\nCourt of Justice for an advisory opinion. In the meantime,\r\nwe shall simply express our agreement with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral as to the importance of securing, within the\r\nframework of the Geneva-based Conference on\r\nDisarmament, a negotiating mandate for the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee on a Nuclear Test Ban. The international\r\ncommunity has been making this appeal for many years.\r\nSuch a step would make possible the drafting of a treaty on\r\nthe subject.\r\nWe trust that the Secretary-General will take advantage\r\nof the opportunity offered by the drafting of an agenda for\r\ndevelopment, as requested by the General Assembly, to\r\nrectify an impression that may have been given that the\r\nbasic economic and social problems affecting the third world\r\nhave been relegated to a lower level in the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nCuba is prepared to engage in dialogue, in any United\r\nNations forum, on any of the items with which the\r\nOrganization deals. We disagree with the Secretary-General\r\nas regards many aspects, but there are many in respect of\r\nwhich we agree with him. As a State Member of this\r\nOrganization, we are prepared to work seriously, flexibly\r\nand in depth, without insisting on any arrangements, and in\r\nany manner by which the Organization could be made more\r\njust, more equitable, more transparent and more efficient and\r\nable to abide by the principles enshrined in the Charter. To\r\nthat end, we are at your disposal, Mr. President, and at the\r\ndisposal of the Secretary-General and of the other Members\r\nof this Organization.\r\nMr. JARAMILLO (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Secretary-General states in his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization:\r\n\"Without peace there can be no development and\r\nthere can be no democracy. Without development, the\r\nbasis for democracy will be lacking and societies will\r\ntend to fall into conflict. And without democracy, no\r\nsustainable development can occur; without such\r\ndevelopment, peace cannot be maintained.\" (A/48/1,\r\npara. 11)\r\nWe are pleased to see that the Secretary-General has taken\r\nup again the integrated approach to development that I have\r\nput forward on many occasions on behalf of the Group of\r\n77.\r\nDevelopment must be integrated. These three\r\nelements - development, democracy and peace - are closely\r\nlinked and are the central axis of progress for peoples. The\r\ninternational community faces the challenge of democratic\r\ndevelopment to achieve peace, which indicates that the\r\nfundamental need of peoples is that of being able to satisfy\r\ntheir basic economic needs in order to begin building\r\nharmonious and democratic societies. Solid and lasting\r\npeace is therefore a result of economic, political and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe work of the Organization consists precisely in\r\nfinding the right mechanisms to fulfil these three objectives.\r\nIt cannot give primacy to one at the expense of the others,\r\nfor the fulfilment of any decision intended to do so brings\r\nserious consequences. The actions taken by the United\r\nNations must be the correct ones in this new era of\r\ninternational relations, when the Organization’s credibility is\r\nat stake.\r\nPutting the complete blame for the crisis on the\r\nquestion of security relegates to the sidelines the economic\r\nand political aspects of international reality. Hence, the\r\ntendency to use the mechanism of peace-keeping operations\r\nwhile overlooking other tools set out in the United Nations\r\nCharter reduces the possibility of finding integrated, long-\r\nterm solutions.\r\nThe proliferation of complex, multidimensional peace-\r\nkeeping operations indicates that this mechanism is being\r\ngiven priority, and the decision to resort to it has not\r\nnecessarily contributed to a more peaceful and harmonious\r\nworld. The disorderly development of some peace-keeping\r\noperations casts doubt on the Organization’s ability to\r\nmanage conflicts. The basic reason for this is that the\r\nUnited Nations has exceeded the spirit of its original aims.\r\nIntervention in a country’s internal power struggles without\r\nstudying its true and objective connection with international\r\npeace and security changes the face of the mediating\r\ncapacity of the United Nations.\r\n30th meeting - Thursday, 14 October l993 11\r\nThere is thus an urgent need for systematic, universal\r\nand open reflection on this question of interest to all\r\nMember States. The very high costs of peace-keeping\r\noperations constitute an unprecedented financial burden for\r\nthe national budgets of Member States striving to meet their\r\ndevelopment needs.\r\nDuring the cold war, the super-Powers assumed the\r\ncosts of conflicts that occurred in their zones of influence.\r\nToday those costs have been transferred to the Organization\r\nand have become universal, thus diverting the funds of all\r\nStates that could be earmarked for economic- and social-\r\ndevelopment projects.\r\nIn view of those considerations, it is essential to\r\nreconsider and review critically the nature of the objectives\r\nand the duration and scope of the mandates of the peace-\r\nkeeping operations, in all their aspects. A critical evaluation\r\nof the results of peace-keeping operations is therefore\r\nnecessary, and in that evaluation each facet of the operations\r\nmust be thoroughly examined: their dynamics, their\r\nduration, the process of establishing them, their composition\r\nand their objectives in the light of the nature of the crisis\r\neach is intended to deal with.\r\nWhile the United Nations, according to the preamble to\r\nthe Charter, seeks \"to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war\", a great many of the present peace-keeping\r\noperations have not been successful in fulfilling that\r\nobjective. Current peace-keeping operations have not\r\nestablished a more stable international order, contrary to the\r\nSecretary-General’s claims. Recent peace-keeping operations\r\nhave more often than not resulted in new conflicts of greater\r\ndimensions.\r\nFaced with the alternative of establishing peace-keeping\r\noperations indiscriminately, as has been done in recent\r\nmonths, we should ensure that the criterion of selectivity\r\nagain becomes pre-eminent. The United Nations cannot\r\nbecome a body of partial intervention in countries’ internal\r\nconflicts. Each crisis and each conflict must be considered\r\ncarefully, together with its own evolution and particular\r\nfeatures. In order to avoid consequences that undermine the\r\ncredibility and the achievement of the objectives sought in\r\nsettling disputes, each one should be understood in all its\r\ndimensions before a peace-keeping operation is launched.\r\nThe structure, mandate, relevance and dimensions of\r\npeace-keeping operations should spring from open,\r\ntransparent and concerted reflection by the Member States of\r\nthe Organization. It is up to them collectively, as the main\r\nactors, to define the new paths in international peace and\r\nsecurity. The tendency to dilute this fundamental principle\r\namounts to disregarding the guiding objectives established in\r\nthe Charter.\r\nConcerned by the apparent increase in new and\r\ndangerous ideas about defining the concept of the State and\r\nof the United Nations in the international system, as\r\npresented to us by the Secretary-General in his report, we\r\nconsider it pertinent to recall in this forum that the United\r\nNations is not and has never been \"more than the sum of its\r\nparts\" (A/48/1, para. 512). The United Nations is an\r\nintergovernmental organization composed of sovereign States\r\nthat participate on an equal footing and take decisions by\r\nmajority or consensus. The concept of the State is at the\r\nvery core of the international system. The\r\ninternationalization of world processes is not evidence of the\r\ndisappearance of the State. In that phenomenon the State\r\nstill prevails, as the sole sovereign entity in the international\r\nsystem.\r\nThe State is the actor and the constant in the\r\ninternational system. The fragmentation of the nation-State,\r\nas can be seen in various regions of the world, creates\r\ninstability and trauma. It is paradoxical that while respect\r\nfor and observance of human rights is being promoted,\r\nindividual and collective tolerance cannot be relied on to\r\nmaintain and hold together inter-cultural, inter-ethnic and\r\npluri-religious societies. Rather than taking their identity\r\nfrom abstract universal and global values, peoples take their\r\nidentity from shared national values engendered by their\r\ncollective evolution within States.\r\nIn this context, the United Nations is a grouping of\r\nsovereign States which individually formed the political will\r\nto come together in a multilateral Organization. Therefore,\r\non the international stage the State plays the principal role.\r\nRegional organizations and the United Nations system play\r\nonly the role that Member States assign them. Thus it is\r\nthat Member States are the axis of the United Nations\r\nsystem, and the various organs that constitute it are\r\nsubordinate to the sovereign political will of those States.\r\nAny other interpretation of this relationship with the\r\nOrganization is erroneous, irrelevant and dangerous to\r\nharmonious and democratic development.\r\nThe Organization must therefore maintain its universal\r\nnature, which means that all Member States participate in the\r\ndecision-making process on an equal footing. The principle\r\nof transparency applies to all aspects of United Nations\r\nactivities, including those relating to peace-keeping and the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Any\r\nrecasting of the Organization cannot ignore these basic\r\nprinciples of its creation and constitution.\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nI should like to refer briefly to our concept of the\r\nUnited Nations organs, always keeping open, of course, the\r\npossibility of returning to this and other subjects in greater\r\ndetail and at greater length at the appropriate time.\r\nThe General Assembly is the principal body of a\r\nuniversal character. All States Members of the Organization\r\nare represented, with equal sovereignty. Therefore,\r\nrevitalizing the Assembly is basic to the ongoing process of\r\nchanging and reviewing the system.\r\nThe Security Council, of course, needs to be reformed.\r\nThe international community needs a more open, more\r\ndeliberative and more transparent Security Council, one that\r\nbetter reflects the new composition of the Organization and\r\nthe new international reality. Reform must include a review\r\nof the veto, the number of permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers and the Council’s rules of procedure.\r\nWith regard to the Secretary-General, it should be noted\r\nthat he is not autonomous and that his mandate emanates\r\nfrom the duties entrusted to him by the principal organs of\r\nthe Organization. As is stated in Chapter XV of the Charter,\r\nthe Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer of\r\nthe Organization; he is exclusively an international official,\r\nresponsible only to the Organization.\r\nSince 1945 the General Assembly has provided the\r\nframework for the departments of the United Nations in the\r\noperational area. Those departments have never been given\r\nany political dimension. Any attempt to do so has\r\nconsistently been rejected in the discussions on the issue in\r\nthe Assembly. We must recall the reservations a great\r\nnumber of States have on this question. The search for\r\nefficiency cannot be carried out through the creation of a\r\nseries of temporary departments.\r\nThe United Nations is not a State, and therefore the\r\nconcept of broadening the political sphere of the roles of the\r\nUnited Nations Resident Coordinators is unacceptable. Such\r\ninitiatives distort the legitimate nature of those departments\r\nin Member States which deal exclusively with operational\r\nactivities, in accordance with relevant resolutions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn the United Nations, political functions are governed\r\nby rules that are completely different from those governing\r\noperational activities. The Security Council and the\r\nCommission on Human Rights are clear examples of this.\r\nEach has its own mechanism for dealing with delicate\r\npolitical questions and for dealing with the matter of\r\nrepresentation. This is a further reason why we are totally\r\nopposed to the idea of broadening the political scope of the\r\nfunctions of Resident Coordinators, a notion that has been\r\nadvanced under the pretext of rationalization and increasing\r\nthe Organization’s efficiency.\r\nIn conclusion, we should like to make clear our support\r\nfor the Secretary-General in all his efforts to reduce costs,\r\nincrease efficiency and eradicate corruption within the\r\nOrganization, and to congratulate and thank him for a\r\ndetailed, comprehensive and exhaustive report, which has\r\nbrought us together here to discuss the activities of the\r\nOrganization. We hope that that same format and detailed\r\ninformation will be found in the reports of other principal\r\norgans, especially that of the Security Council.\r\nORGANIZATION OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have two announcements relating\r\nto our work.\r\nFirst, I propose that the list of speakers in the debate on\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report be closed today at 12.30 p.m.\r\nIf I hear no objection, I shall take it that the Assembly\r\naccepts that proposal.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I therefore request those\r\nrepresentatives wishing to participate in the debate to\r\ninscribe their names on the list of speakers as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nSecondly, members will recall that at its third plenary\r\nmeeting on 24 September the General Assembly decided to\r\nhold four plenary meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday,\r\n26 and 27 October, to examine, under agenda item 112,\r\n\"International drug control\", the status of international\r\ncooperation against the illicit production, sale, demand,\r\ntraffic and distribution of narcotics and psychotropic\r\nsubstances. I wish to propose, in view of the large number\r\nof Member States already inscribed on the list of speakers,\r\nthat the length of statements be limited to 10 minutes.\r\nMembers’ cooperation will be sincerely appreciated.\r\nIf I hear no objection, I shall take it that the Assembly\r\nagrees with the proposal.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 10 (continued)\r\nREPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE\r\nWORK OF THE ORGANIZATION (A/48/1)\r\n30th meeting - Thursday, 14 October l993 13\r\nMr. VILCHEZ ASHER (Nicaragua) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): We support the statement made on behalf of\r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and its Chairman.\r\nMy country is proud to be a member of that group.\r\nIn referring to the Secretary-General’s report on the\r\nwork of the Organization, I harbour the hope that with the\r\nend of the cold war the United Nations will continue to\r\nperform, and will gain strength in, its essential task of\r\nestablishing a new international order in which peace and\r\nprogress prevail in accordance with the tenets of the Charter.\r\nTo that end, the United Nations should support and promote\r\neconomic and social development throughout the world and\r\nthe consolidation of universal and interdependent democratic\r\nvalues.\r\nOur country supports the view that the development of\r\nmankind is now universal in nature and that therefore its\r\nrealization requires new political initiatives and broad,\r\ncoordinated global efforts, which, by their very nature, can\r\nbe made only by the United Nations. Therefore, our\r\nOrganization is more indispensable today than ever.\r\nWe should like on this occasion to reaffirm our\r\ncountry’s commitment to play a determined role in the task\r\nof building a new international order, with equity, justice and\r\na life of dignity for our peoples. In carrying out that fine\r\nand arduous task, our country approves and supports all\r\nefforts and policies designed to improve the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations system. In that spirit,\r\nwe support the initiatives to ensure effective attainment of\r\nthe purposes of the Charter.\r\nWith regard to the functioning of the General\r\nAssembly, we support the suggestions for revitalizing the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s work put forward by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report, especially those that have to do with\r\nrationalizing the Assembly’s work, taking a good look at the\r\nformat of resolutions and assessing whether there is a real\r\nneed for many of the reports. We feel, incidentally, that if\r\nthe General Assembly is to be made more effective, the role\r\nof the President must be strengthened.\r\nWe believe that the Security Council must be reformed.\r\nWe are in favour of increasing the number of permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members in line with the number of new\r\nMembers of the Organization, and believe that countries\r\nrepresenting Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America should\r\nbe included; this would be a credible expression of the\r\nchanges that are taking place in the world, and would\r\nstrengthen an effective democratization of the Council’s\r\ndecision-making process.\r\nAlso, we support all measures aimed at strengthening\r\nour Organization financially. Many have been proposed by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report. We also appeal to all\r\nthe countries that are in arrears with the United Nations to\r\nmake efforts to fulfil their financial obligations. By doing\r\nso, they would contribute to increasing and improving the\r\nOrganizations’s efficiency and effectiveness in carrying out\r\nthe many tasks it is now performing, both at Headquarters\r\nand in various regions world wide.\r\nWe wish to alert the Assembly to the fact that, as we\r\nseek a new international order, the breach between the rich\r\nfew and the many poor nations is widening dangerously, and\r\nthat this yawning gap has been further widened in our own\r\nnations by war, instability and underdevelopment. If this\r\nnegative trend continues, the goals of consolidating peace,\r\neconomic development and social well-being will be difficult\r\nto achieve. This situation should be better reflected in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report.\r\nSpeeding up the economic growth which brings with it\r\nthe increased social investment that ensures the majority’s\r\nright to health care, social security, education and jobs is\r\nbecoming a matter of urgency: in other words, it is urgent\r\nthat we satisfy the basic needs of our peoples. These\r\npriorities should be studied more thoroughly.\r\nJust a few days ago, before the Assembly, our President\r\nsaid that:\r\n\"We need to build a democracy, reconstruct a\r\nwounded society and compete economically with the\r\nworld, all while following an economic adjustment plan\r\nthat leaves us no resources for social investment. ...\"\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-eighth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 8th meeting, p. 11)\r\nThis situation is not just; neither is it acceptable, and even\r\nless is it democratic. And it deserves the international\r\ncommunity’s understanding.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations and the international\r\nfinancial bodies must support the developing countries - and\r\nin particular those countries going through difficult transitions -\r\nin seeking alternative policies against underdevelopment and\r\ncrisis that have as their basis equity and social justice. We\r\nalso need, from the international financial community, more\r\nsympathy with and understanding of our agonizing economic\r\nand social problems.\r\nWe are convinced that to build a new world order what\r\nis needed is more dialogue - and constant consultation -\r\nbetween the developed and the developing world. We\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ntherefore support the revitalization of the North-South\r\ndialogue urged by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, and we believe that the United Nations must\r\ngive greater priority to such initiatives.\r\nWe believe that the Secretary-General’s report must\r\nalso deal with key trade aspects, and, in this connection, we\r\ndesire fair and non-discriminatory treatment for our exports,\r\nas well as adjustment policies that take into account social\r\ninvestment and benefit the great majority of our people;\r\nwithout such treatment and policies, there is no way that we\r\ncan consolidate peace, preserve democracy, achieve social\r\njustice and, in the case of Central America, turn our region\r\ninto a region of peace, democracy, freedom and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the United Nations is\r\ntaking new steps towards strengthening the international\r\nsystem for protecting and promoting human rights. The\r\nactivities of the Centre for Human Rights and the results of\r\nthe Vienna Conference represent significant contributions;\r\nNicaragua fully supports them. We share with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral the conviction that there is a need for more States\r\nto ratify all the international human rights instruments.\r\nWe believe that the development of preventive\r\ndiplomacy is closely linked to finding solutions for wide-\r\nranging economic and development problems and also to\r\ncountries’ readiness to come into the innovative mechanisms\r\nbeing established by the United Nations. In this connection,\r\nwe support all the Secretary-General’s, and our\r\nOrganization’s, efforts and initiatives.\r\nWithin this framework, our country supports the request\r\nmade by the Government of Guatemala to the United\r\nNations that it come out firmly in support of the national\r\ndialogue that could lead to complete peace in that sister\r\ncountry.\r\nWe also support implementation of the Security\r\nCouncil’s resolutions and punctilious fulfilment of the\r\nGovernors Island Agreement on Haiti, and we strongly urge\r\nthe political forces in that country to respect that Agreement\r\nand restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.\r\nWe congratulate the United Nations and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the success of their mission in El Salvador,\r\nwhere they have managed to achieve peace and promote\r\nnational dialogue and reconciliation as civilized norms of\r\nhuman behaviour. The multidisciplinary nature of the\r\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL)\r\nleads us to believe that what is already called this United\r\nNations Mission’s \"Salvadorian model\" could be tried in\r\nother regions.\r\nAs in the case of ONUSAL, the United Nations\r\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) has also just\r\ncome to a very successful conclusion. As a result of\r\nUNTAC, a Government has been established on the basis of\r\nfree and democratic elections supported by the majority of\r\nthe Cambodian people, a Government that can as a result\r\ncontinue the peace process that has been initiated and steer\r\nour sister country of Cambodia onto the path towards\r\ndevelopment and well-being; the Government can do this as\r\npart of a democracy that is guaranteed by a restored\r\nconstitutional monarchy symbolizing the unity of the\r\nCambodian people.\r\nThe success of the United Nations missions in\r\nEl Salvador and Cambodia tells us that when peoples are\r\ndetermined to seek and win national peace and reconciliation\r\nand achieve economic growth and development to benefit the\r\nmajority, United Nations missions - if they have clear\r\nobjectives and the right focus - have a great likelihood of\r\nsucceeding. The international community and the financial\r\ninstitutions should therefore continue to provide assistance\r\nand cooperation in order to safeguard the already sustained\r\nand lasting success of many of these missions and to ensure\r\nthat any progress made is not reversed and that crises do not\r\nbecome permanent.\r\nOn another note, we regret the increasing difficulties\r\nbeing experienced by the Organization, and the countries\r\ninvolved, in efforts to achieve peace, re-establish order and\r\nrestart the development process, both in the countries of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia and in Somalia. It is clear, however, that\r\nwithout a United Nations presence the consequences of these\r\nconflicts could have been even more painful. We agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General in his recognition that\r\n\"... The vast potential of the world Organization has\r\nbeen recognized and has begun to be employed in the\r\nestablishment of a more stable world order: as a\r\nstrengthened voice for the poorest countries ...\",\r\n(A/48/1, para. 2)\r\namongst other important objectives.\r\nWe believe that, with the end of the East-West conflict,\r\nthere is a historic opportunity for international peace and\r\nsecurity to be built on the basis of new international realities\r\nthat attach greater importance to the problems of\r\ndevelopment and to multilateral approaches to solving\r\nconflicts by peaceful and negotiated means. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, indeed, tells us so in various ways. We\r\n30th meeting - Thursday, 14 October l993 15\r\nalso need to ensure that the United Nations becomes the\r\ndetermining mechanism par excellence for maintaining peace\r\nin order to save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar.\r\nOur country also agrees with the Secretary-General\r\nwhen he says that\r\n\"Without peace, there can be no development and\r\nthere can be no democracy. Without development, the\r\nbasis for democracy will be lacking and societies will\r\ntend to fall into conflict. And without democracy, no\r\nsustainable development can occur; without such\r\ndevelopment, peace cannot long be maintained.\" (ibid.,\r\npara. 11)\r\nThat is exactly the nature of the recurrent crisis in the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nGiven this guiding light of truth on the subject of\r\ndevelopment, we believe that the United Nations now, more\r\nthan ever, plays a determining role. We must ensure that the\r\nOrganization and the Secretary-General act, and continue to\r\nact, with a sense of urgency to renew the United Nations\r\ncommitment to development. Nicaragua supports, and will\r\ncontinue to support, the initiative to draft an agenda for\r\ndevelopment to complement the \"Agenda for Peace\", and we\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s assurances that the agenda\r\nfor development will be something more than just another\r\ndevelopment theory: we hope that it will fulfil the\r\naspirations of our peoples.\r\nIn the Secretary-General’s report, he gives expression\r\nto the realism that we need in viewing and studying the\r\ndevelopment of the international situation. Realism, in our\r\nopinion, is the most useful tool for building a more just and\r\nequitable world society.\r\nToday, after the end of the cold war, it is once again\r\npossible to fulfil the lofty purposes of the Charter. The\r\nUnited Nations, in so doing, can rely on the support of the\r\nworld community, and its actions will therefore have to take\r\nhuman development as their basic premise. Respect for\r\nhuman rights, for development and for peace - our most\r\nheartfelt desires - must be the legacy we leave to succeeding\r\ngenerations. Only thus shall we be able to make this world\r\na better place, and only thus can we make every human\r\nbeing an exemplar of social justice and liberty.\r\nMr. GOLOB (Slovenia): The report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/48/1)\r\nis certainly excellent and very instructive. It is a reminder\r\nthat United Nations activities do not represent an end in\r\nthemselves and that they do not provide a sense of true\r\nsatisfaction. The report is an expression of the endeavours\r\nand deep dedication of United Nations personnel, and we\r\nunderstand it as a call for a critical examination. We also\r\nunderstand the report as a timely invitation to think about,\r\nand to try to peer behind, the everyday scene of international\r\naffairs.\r\nThere is wide agreement that we are living in a world\r\nthat is changing rapidly, at least in some respects. It has\r\nbecome almost a cliché that the world is experiencing great\r\nchanges, so it may be of some use to say something about\r\nthese changes. Change, to our mind, is like a conveyor belt\r\n- endless and ever-moving. It seems to have a habit of\r\nmoving in fits, leaps, bounds and rebounds. An exhilaration\r\nat change is certainly understandable, but that is not enough;\r\nit is also necessary to understand where changes come from\r\nand where they are leading. Of no less importance is\r\nperceiving the implication of the \"why’s\" and \"where to’s\",\r\nsince we are faced with the need to accept them.\r\nChange, with its many faces, is causing some to rejoice\r\nwhile provoking stress and apprehension in others, but it\r\ncertainly is a vehicle for the brave, for the bold and for the\r\nforward-looking. Change is making more visible the fact\r\nthat there is no single remedy for all situations and that\r\nattempts to manage these changes therefore carry great\r\nresponsibility. The United Nations has been, throughout its\r\nexistence, a vehicle of change. It has managed to be the\r\nharbinger and the midwife, acting sometimes against and in\r\nthe face of powerful interests that would rather see the status\r\nquo maintained at all costs. The United Nations, we recall,\r\nwas at its most efficient, producing stable and enduring\r\nanswers, when changes were the property of all, not the\r\nproduct of the few.\r\nSelf-determination is a case in point. Throughout\r\nmodern times, self-determination has in some instances been\r\nmet with approval, while in others it has faced tough\r\nopposition. The situation seems no better and no worse\r\ntoday. Self-determination is certainly unpredictable in its\r\nconsequences. Over the past decades, it has produced a\r\nwhole new world, and it keeps changing this world to this\r\nday and into tomorrow, with often unexpected results.\r\nSuggestions are now being made to limit the right to\r\nself-determination. In the end, these attempts may prove\r\ncostly, useless and even harmful. True, self-determination\r\nmay be misused to provoke hatred, hegemony and\r\nhomogenization. We have seen examples of this in the past\r\nfew years, for instance in the dissolution of obsolete but\r\nheretofore sovereign States Members of the United Nations.\r\nHowever, the developments in former Member States prove\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\neither that calamity can be avoided - as was the case in at\r\nleast one instance - or that a tragedy can very well be\r\ncompounded if wisdom is in too short supply or if the right\r\nto self-determination falls prey to demagogues and\r\ndemagoguery. Imposing limits on the right to self-\r\ndetermination will not cut short the demagogues. There\r\nseems to be no other way but to establish that respect for\r\nhuman rights is the basic criterion for the implementation of\r\nthe right to self-determination.\r\nMuch has been said in this Hall, and rightly so, about\r\nhuman rights. Respect for and implementation of human\r\nrights represent an important vehicle for change, because\r\nhuman rights legitimize the political movement for\r\ndemocracy. They are no less important for successful\r\npreventive diplomacy.\r\nWe view human rights as a bridge over the abyss of\r\nviolence. In order to fortify this bridge and make it\r\navailable to all, human rights should be vehemently and\r\ncontinuously upheld, particularly when a warlord or\r\ndemagogue chooses to achieve his aims by fire and by\r\nsword.\r\nBut let us face it: sometimes it takes too long for the\r\ninternational community to see, or to admit that it sees, that\r\nhuman rights are being trampled underfoot. Sometimes it\r\ntakes too long to react, and untold numbers of people are left\r\nto fend for themselves, suffering injustices while yearning\r\nfor peace and for democratic relations. This certainly is\r\nnothing new - there were death camps and gulags in our\r\nlifetime - but it is simply wrong, and dangerous, for the\r\ninternational community to let this happen at the end of this\r\ncentury, in this time.\r\nLack of respect for human rights is usually the first\r\nwisp of smoke that can tell all those who want to see it that\r\na crisis is in the making. That is the moment to act and not\r\njust to compile data and monitor the situation. The world\r\ncannot afford the luxury of waiting, beating around the bush\r\nand misreading the signals when there is a case of massive\r\nviolation of human rights. Let me repeat that violations of\r\nhuman rights are the most reliable and the most visible\r\nearly-warning signal flagging the rising danger. Hence, one\r\nwould wish that the human rights standards of the Council\r\nof Europe were valid around the globe and, if necessary,\r\ncould be improved around the globe.\r\nWe in Slovenia have experienced the vital importance\r\nof these principles in our recent past, and we are wholly\r\ndedicated to them. With regard to minorities we maintain an\r\ninternationally very high level as regards the enhancement of\r\ntheir human rights.\r\nFor obvious reasons, conflict prevention and preventive\r\ndiplomacy are celebrated activities these days. The concept\r\nis being creatively developed by the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the United Nations and\r\nother organizations. We seem to be faced with a dilemma\r\nas to whether the concept should be a wide one or a narrow\r\none. There is hardly any doubt in our mind that the concept\r\nshould be a wide one. It is good, but not nearly enough, if\r\npreventive diplomacy is kept mainly within the scope of\r\nfact-finding, monitoring and observing.\r\nLooking at the horizon of peace-keeping operations and\r\nat the horizon of preventive diplomacy, it is to be noted that\r\nmore often than not precious little is being said about the\r\ncauses of conflicts. Without focusing on the causes of\r\nconflict, preventive action is groping in the dark. It is\r\nconventional wisdom that wherever there is conflict there is\r\ninjustice. The element of justice is sometimes absent, and\r\nwithout it preventive action tends to restore the status quo\r\nante. Conflict prevention and preventive diplomacy are thus\r\nrendered helpless in their main task; to our mind, that main\r\ntask is to establish new and stable relationships.\r\nIn our view, preventive diplomacy and preventive\r\naction are not to prevent change but to prevent the escalation\r\nof war and suffering, to bring about peaceful change in an\r\norderly and democratic way and to establish the basis for\r\nfuture stable relations. Hence, attention should be paid\r\nequally to putting out the fires of war, violence and\r\ndestruction in the present and to laying down the framework\r\nfor the future. This framework for the future will, however,\r\nbe uncertain if it is cast in the mould of the old.\r\nThere has been a lot of talk about regional\r\narrangements lately, and rightly so. It is of particular\r\nimportance that the United Nations continue to cultivate a\r\nrelationship of partnership with regional organizations and\r\nshun relationships of subordination. It is of great importance\r\nthat these regional arrangements be developed on democratic\r\npremises. These arrangements will serve hardly any useful,\r\nmuch less positive, purpose if they are just refurbished\r\nsystems of old arrangements or a barely veiled attempt to\r\nresurrect or reconstruct the inviable State entities that have\r\nfallen apart, causing so much suffering in the process.\r\nReconstituting or reconstructing those entities would seem to\r\nbe nothing but an invitation to another crisis or one more\r\nconflict waiting to happen.\r\nSweden, the Chairman-in-Office of the Council of\r\nMinisters of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE), has brought the CSCE into a logical and\r\nforward-looking relationship with the United Nations. It\r\nmay be time now to give a thought to the possibility of the\r\n30th meeting - Thursday, 14 October l993 17\r\nparticipation of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of\r\nthe CSCE in the deliberations of the Security Council\r\nwhenever it is considering an issue from the CSCE area.\r\nThe Security Council could profit from the insights of the\r\nCSCE, and the road to cooperation between the two\r\norganizations could be significantly shortened.\r\nSocial tensions, overpopulation and unemployment will\r\nlikely be among the underlying causes of outbursts of\r\nviolence, strife and war. To deal with them will take more\r\nthan armour; it will take politically, socially and\r\neconomically minded people to deal creatively with the\r\nsituation.\r\nI wish next to discuss the issue of transition from the\r\ntotalitarianism to democracy, from command economy to\r\nmarket economy. Beholding the scene of Central and\r\nEastern Europe, one inevitably arrives at the conclusion that\r\nin the wake of the bipolar world there are new problems and\r\nnew uncertainties. The nations of Europe have yet to\r\nformulate a new comprehensive policy for the continent.\r\nSuch a policy cannot be based on the old precepts of the\r\npolicy of containment. Containment was no doubt an\r\neffective policy that kept the totalitarian East at bay for\r\ndecades. However, the remains of the policy of containment\r\nare still weighing heavily on Central and Eastern Europe’s\r\nrelations with the rest of the world.\r\nNow a policy of enlargement - enlargement of the core\r\nof market economies and democratic States - is being\r\nlaunched. To our mind, however, this presupposes the\r\nabandonment of all vestiges of the policy of containment and\r\nan ever stronger involvement of these countries in a true\r\npartnership. Involvement will remain necessary in order for\r\nthese countries to be able to assume their share of\r\nresponsibility for the future and the stability of Europe. The\r\nbudding democracies must be strengthened; limping\r\neconomies must be set on the right foot; and security must\r\nbe enhanced to the extent that will allow undisturbed\r\npolitical and social development.\r\nI do not want this to be understood as a Euro-centric\r\nshopping list of hopes. I think it can be viewed as a part of\r\nthe programme for any region, and for the United Nations as\r\nwell.\r\nMrs. Fritsche (Liechtenstein), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMr. KALPAGÉ (Sri Lanka): The Sri Lanka delegation\r\nwishes to congratulate the Secretary-General for presenting\r\nwhat he himself has referred to as\r\n\"the longest report of the Secretary-General to the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the work of the Organization in\r\nmany years\". (A/48/1, para. 26)\r\nIt is indeed a comprehensive overview of the manifold\r\nactivities of the different organs and other bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nIn his introduction, the Secretary-General speaks of the\r\nnew opportunity that presented itself one year ago with the\r\nend of the cold war. We agree that there are\r\naccomplishments to be applauded. But, as he himself has\r\nstated, they do not provide a sense of true satisfaction.\r\nDuring the past year, \"An Agenda for Peace\" has been\r\nthe centre of attention at the United Nations. Preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict\r\npeace-building have been exhaustively debated and\r\ndiscussed. On the eve of the present, forty-eighth, session\r\nof the General Assembly, a resolution on these topics was\r\nadopted by consensus. My delegation had hoped that an\r\nagenda for development would not be long delayed. Even\r\nthough it has not yet materialized, we look forward to the\r\npreliminary report which the Secretary-General intends to\r\nsubmit to the General Assembly at this session.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General’s comment that\r\nwork in the economic and social sectors needs greater focus,\r\nclear direction and indeed equal, if not greater, priority. We\r\nbelieve however that the remedy should go beyond\r\ninstitutional revamping. It should encompass policy aspects\r\ncommensurate with the Charter responsibilities deriving from\r\nArticle I, that the United Nations\r\n\"be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in\r\nthe attainment of ... common ends\".\r\nFor a variety of reasons the United Nations has not yet\r\nbeen able to use this mandate fully in the economic sphere.\r\nWe are encouraged by the Secretary-General’s determination\r\nto fill this gap. Indeed all the good work of the United\r\nNations in the political and security spheres may not be\r\nsustainable in the long term if the socio-economic\r\ndimensions of peace and security are relegated to secondary\r\nstatus.\r\nThe ways and means of reactivating the North-South\r\ndialogue, the United Nations role in that process, and\r\npragmatic and affordable concepts and mechanisms for\r\nmeeting the need for additional resources are some of the\r\nissues to be addressed with purpose and commitment. We\r\nawait policy options on these issues for consideration by\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMember States in the forthcoming report on an agenda for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn the general debate of this Assembly, my Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs put forward some ideas for harmonizing the\r\nneed for additional resources for development with available\r\nprivate capital through an interest subsidy mechanism.\r\nPeace, development and democracy are interlinked.\r\nThe Secretary-General states:\r\n\"There can be no flowering of development without\r\nthe parallel advance of another key concept:\r\ndemocratization. Peace is a prerequisite to development;\r\ndemocracy is essential if development is to succeed\r\nover the long term.\" (A/48/1, para. 9)\r\nWhen the Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary of the United Nations was deliberating on a\r\ntheme for the anniversary, some of us tried to add peace,\r\ndevelopment and democracy to the generally accepted \"We\r\nthe peoples ...\". But \"democracy\" proved difficult for some\r\nMember States to accept. It was then suggested that peace,\r\nequality, justice and development would find consensus, in\r\nkeeping with the preamble to the Charter. In the event, the\r\nPreparatory Committee settled for \"We the peoples of the\r\nUnited Nations ... united for a better world\". We hope that\r\nin the solemn declaration which the Working Group of the\r\nPreparatory Committee will be preparing, it will be possible\r\nto articulate more clearly what kind of better world we are\r\nunited for. In this connection, we cannot possibly avoid\r\nemphasizing peace, development and democracy.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General states:\r\n\"... democracy within States can be fully sustained over\r\ntime only if it is linked to expanding democratization\r\namong States at all levels of the international system.\"\r\n(ibid., para. 10)\r\nThis is surely true also of the United Nations and its\r\nprincipal organs.\r\nThe Organization is based on the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of all its Members. In the discussions of\r\nthe Open-Ended Working Group on the Revitalization of the\r\nWork of the General Assembly, which Sri Lanka had the\r\nhonour to co-chair, it was recognized that the General\r\nAssembly is the only principal organ of the United Nations\r\nconsisting of all the Members of the United Nations in\r\nwhich each Member State has an equal opportunity to\r\nparticipate in the decision-making process. That is why the\r\nGeneral Assembly has now decided that the revitalization of\r\nits work should be addressed in a comprehensive manner.\r\nAs a first step, the Assembly decided to reduce the number\r\nof its Main Committees from seven to six. The\r\nrevitalization process is to continue comprehensively at this\r\nsession in an informal open-ended working group. The\r\nrationalization of our agenda is a priority item for\r\nconsideration.\r\nIt is equally important that democratization should\r\nextend to other parts of the United Nations system, even to\r\nthe Security Council. Proposals have been made for a\r\npossible review of the membership of the Security Council.\r\nDemocratization demands that its membership reflect the\r\nrealities of today rather than the global power structure of 48\r\nyears ago.\r\nDecisions of the Security Council are binding on all\r\nMember States. Therefore, there must be some mechanism\r\nfor broader participation in the decision-making process of\r\nthe Security Council or at least for a general acceptance of\r\ndecisions made. This would promote greater understanding\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly. It\r\nwould thus enable the Security Council to discharge more\r\nsuccessfully its primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAccording to Article 24 of the Charter, it is in order to\r\nensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations\r\nthat its Members confer on the Security Council primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this\r\nresponsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf.\r\nWould some recent decisions of the Security Council be\r\nendorsed by all or even the majority of Member States?\r\nThere is an opportunity now to review the membership of\r\nthe Security Council, and that opportunity should be seized\r\nin order to ensure that democratization and the transparency\r\nof the decision-making process are kept in mind. This is a\r\nmatter to which my delegation expects to revert under the\r\nappropriate agenda item.\r\nIn his report the Secretary-General refers at length to\r\npeace-keeping. The cost of peace-keeping is expected to rise\r\nfrom $1.4 billion in 1992 to an estimated $3.6 billion by the\r\nend of 1993. And yet there is increasing concern about\r\nsome of the peace-keeping operations currently under way.\r\nWhile there have been a few notable successes - such as, for\r\nexample, in Cambodia - the goal of establishing peace and\r\nstability in several areas is still far from being achieved.\r\nThis is a matter which merits a thorough review.\r\nPeace-keeping in all its aspects will be dealt with in the new\r\nSpecial Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth\r\nCommittee). It is our hope that these discussions, to which\r\n30th meeting - Thursday, 14 October l993 19\r\nall Member States have access, will facilitate a consensus on\r\nthe future directions of the United Nations in peace-keeping\r\nactivities.\r\nAs my Minister stated in the general debate:\r\n\"As the transition continues to a new global order,\r\nthe United Nations will come under greater pressure to\r\nlive up to its ideals. However, in order to command\r\nthe widest possible support, the United Nations must\r\noperate on the basis of an acceptable set of guiding\r\nprinciples.\" (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nForty-eighth Session, Plenary Meetings, 13th meeting,\r\np. 38)\r\nThese are the principles of the Charter.\r\nMrs. ESCALER (Philippines): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/48/1). It is not only substantive, thorough\r\nand comprehensive, but also thought-provoking. I should\r\nlike to comment on a few of the issues raised in the report.\r\nFirst of all, we share the Secretary-General’s view that\r\nthe United Nations should play a pivotal role in promoting\r\nnot only peace and security, but also - and, in our view,\r\nmore important - development. Development issues, in my\r\ndelegation’s view, should remain at the core of the United\r\nNations agenda because of the beneficial connection and\r\nlinkage between development and parallel advances in\r\ndemocratization. As the Secretary-General points out - and\r\nwe agree with him - democratization must take hold, not\r\nonly within a State, but also among States in the\r\ninternational community. This, in turn, should translate into\r\nmultilateral cooperation to support both democratization and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is in this regard that the United Nations has a vital\r\nrole to play in promoting international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. We hope that the sense of urgency given to\r\ninternational peace and security and the promotion of human\r\nrights can also be given to development issues, for one\r\ncannot deny the increasing economic and technological gap\r\nbetween the developed and the developing countries and the\r\nnecessity of finding multilateral solutions to close it. The\r\nUnited Nations cannot afford to marginalize the priorities of\r\nthe majority of its Members, which remain anchored on\r\nsustaining the development process and increasing the\r\nprosperity of their peoples.\r\nThus, while we had hoped to have before us at this\r\nsession the Secretary-General’s agenda for development, we\r\nnevertheless look forward to receiving his preliminary report\r\non this subject later this year. We further hope that the final\r\nreport will be made available soon thereafter.\r\nThe expanding role of the United Nations today in\r\naddressing issues of international peace and security;\r\npolitical, economic and social issues; and those of the\r\nenvironment and development inevitably taxes the resources\r\navailable to it. This means that the reorganization must not\r\nonly have the necessary financial and logistical resources for\r\nits activities, but, more important, the management capability\r\nto allocate these efficiently and productively. At this point,\r\nallow me to reiterate the statement which the Philippines\r\nSecretary of Foreign Affairs, Roberto Romulo, made before\r\nthis body at its 20th meeting last week and in which he\r\nsuggested exploring the possibility of the United Nations\r\nutilizing a group with expertise in corporate and scientific\r\nmanagement to consider the question of United Nations\r\nreform in all its aspects. I must caution, however, that\r\nefforts to create greater efficiency should not have a negative\r\nimpact on United Nations programmes and projects essential\r\nto the welfare of developing countries.\r\nAt last year’s session, we had before us the historic\r\nreport of the Secretary-General \"An Agenda for Peace\"\r\n(A/47/277). The two resolutions adopted at the forty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly in response to it\r\n(resolutions 47/120 A and B) established a number of\r\nprinciples to guide United Nations implementation of peace-\r\nkeeping activities considered in the report, particularly those\r\nof the sovereign equality of States and transparency in\r\nestablishing United Nations peace-keeping operations. They\r\nalso acknowledge that some of the concepts in \"An Agenda\r\nfor Peace\" are evolving. We believe this to be a prudent\r\ndecision as it implies that the effectiveness of these concepts\r\nmust still be ascertained. We welcome the fact that\r\nimproving the implementation of Article 50 of the Charter\r\nis also addressed in one of these resolutions.\r\nIn view of the growing involvement of the United\r\nNations in preventive diplomacy and humanitarian and\r\nrelated conflict resolution activities, my delegation, in\r\nprinciple, sees the usefulness of a comprehensive review and\r\nassessment by the General Assembly of all aspects of United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations, preferably by a single\r\nuniversal body. This would include issues such as mandates,\r\nsafety, and financial management.\r\nThe Philippines recognizes that the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security is a collective responsibility.\r\nOur participation in a major United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperation was a reflection of this. However, our\r\nparticipation in that operation entailed a considerable\r\nfinancial burden on our part, as no doubt it did for other\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ntroop-contributing countries, particularly the developing\r\ncountries among them. The delays in reimbursements of\r\ntroop costs and compensations for this operation\r\ncompounded our difficulties. Recognizing that timely\r\npayment of assessed contributions is linked to this issue, we\r\nnevertheless hope that any exercise aimed at rationalizing\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations addresses this\r\nparticular subject.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly is aimed at\r\nenhancing the capacity of the General Assembly to fulfil its\r\nrole as envisaged under the Charter. It should therefore be\r\nundertaken in a comprehensive manner. We look forward to\r\nthe early convening of the informal open-ended working\r\ngroup established by resolution 47/233, which should make\r\nproposals on issues such as the reports of United Nations\r\nprincipal organs to the General Assembly.\r\nFinally, we believe that discussions on the expansion of\r\nthe membership of the Security Council should be\r\nundertaken in the context of the democratization of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly with a view to increasing the\r\ntransparency of the Council’s work and the participation of\r\nnon-Council Members in its decision-making process. We\r\nlook forward to our debate on this subject and, in this\r\nconnection, would be favourably disposed towards a\r\nprocedural decision to continue detailed deliberation on this\r\nand related issues through an open-ended, structured and\r\ntransparent mechanism.\r\nMrs. HASSAN (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe delegation of Egypt takes pleasure in participating in\r\ndiscussing the Secretary-General’s report on the work of the\r\nOrganization at a time of dynamic change in an international\r\nscene that more than ever before calls for us to intensify the\r\nrole of the United Nations, to reinforce the positive aspects\r\nand remedy the negative in order for us to build a world\r\norder that would guarantee progress and prosperity for all\r\nMember States and meet the challenges that face us, with the\r\nparticipation of all and in the interests of all.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s report on the\r\nwork of the Organization contained in document A/48/1.\r\nThe report invites us to reflect on and define the\r\nopportunities before the United Nations and the challenges\r\nthat face it at present. These are indeed new opportunities\r\nthat would make it possible to promote international\r\ncooperation in dealing with many of the problems that beset\r\nthe world, especially the problem of endemic poverty and\r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nAt the same time, we face challenges that arise from\r\nethnic conflicts and the disintegration of nation States. On\r\nthe whole, the United Nations has never been faced before\r\nby so many demands and has never been the focus of so\r\nmany expectations. In his report to the General Assembly,\r\nthe Secretary-General has emphasized, in general terms, the\r\nenormous potential of the United Nations and the importance\r\nof using that potential in order to build a more stable world.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General reviews the\r\nachievements and the shortcomings of the past year, as\r\nreflected in the Organization’s successes, as I said, but also\r\nin its set-backs. The report quite adequately describes the\r\nactivities of the United Nations in all areas; it proposes the\r\nmeasures of cooperation needed for strengthening the United\r\nNations as an organization and for enhancing the role of that\r\nOrganization, which is central to today’s world because it\r\nconvenes meetings on a variety of subjects with the\r\nparticipation of all Member States on the basis of sovereign\r\nequality.\r\nThe report details the work carried out by the various\r\ndepartments of the Secretariat and the various organs of the\r\nOrganization, in the area of peace and security. However,\r\non the work carried out by the economic and the social\r\nsectors, the report is much less clear. This is perhaps the\r\nresult of the proliferation of institutions and bodies working\r\nin those two areas. However, in view of the importance of\r\nthe issues involved in those two spheres, it would be useful\r\nand indeed important to remedy this shortcoming in future\r\nreports.\r\nIn analysing the contents of the report concerning the\r\ngains made and the losses inflicted by reality, and the pattern\r\nof developments over the past 12 months, we are bound to\r\narrive at a constant fact, namely the comprehensive nature of\r\nthe global challenges the world must face and the\r\nindissoluble link between maintaining peace and\r\ndevelopment in all its aspects.\r\nThere is no development without peace, and without\r\ndevelopment there can be no basis for peace. In the absence\r\nof development, societies will veer towards conflict. When\r\nwe look at the development of peace-keeping operations over\r\nthe past year, we note another fact, highlighted by operations\r\nin the field, which is the need to look at those operations\r\nfrom an integral standpoint and the need for the operations\r\nto deal not only with the military aspects: attention must\r\nalso be paid to the political, economic, social and\r\nhumanitarian aspects.\r\nIn this respect, the delegation of Egypt wishes to stress\r\nthe importance of facing up to non-military threats with the\r\nsame vigour and determination we show in confronting\r\nmilitary threats. Destitution, famine and natural disasters are\r\n30th meeting - Thursday, 14 October l993 21\r\nalso sources of instability, and the United Nations must\r\ntherefore assume a leading role in facing up to such non-\r\nmilitary threats to international peace and security.\r\nThe basic objective of the United Nations should be to\r\ncreate conditions that, to the best possible extent, would be\r\nconducive to reducing instability and diminishing the threats\r\nto peace. We need to get at the root causes of such\r\nproblems and reduce the risks before situations arise and call\r\nfor peace-keeping operations or, in the worst scenario,\r\ndeteriorate and make it necessary to resort to coercive\r\nmeasures for the imposition of peace.\r\nThe discussion on the \"Agenda for Peace\" - which, we\r\nfeel, is only a beginning and not an end - has highlighted\r\nnew concepts that relate to a number of preventive measures\r\nwhich require States to develop a different outlook and a\r\ndifferent approach. The adoption of a resolution on this\r\nsubject here, during the forty-seventh session, affords an\r\nopportunity for the Member States of the Organization to\r\ngive further consideration to its contents so that, in the\r\nfuture, they can take a positive and realistic stance vis-à-vis\r\nthose concepts and translate \"preventive diplomacy\" from\r\nhigh-sounding words into reality.\r\nGiven the changes that have taken place and the\r\nchallenges that face the world and which cannot be\r\ncontrolled by any one State or group of States, the United\r\nNations has an even greater responsibility to ensure the\r\nachievement of peace and development, as provided for in\r\nparagraph 4 of Article 1 of the Charter, which stipulates that\r\nthe Organization should:\r\n\"... be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations\r\nin the attainment of these common ends\".\r\nUnquestionably, this has a direct effect on the organs of\r\nthe Organization which, at present, are undergoing\r\nrestructuring and reform.\r\nIn this regard, I should like to highlight the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the main organ of the United Nations\r\nand to stress the importance of enhancing that role. The\r\ntables and figures in the Secretary-General’s report indicate\r\na rapid increase in the workload of the Security Council and\r\nin the attendant peace-keeping operations as well as in the\r\nactivities of the Secretariat. My delegation wishes to suggest\r\nthat we should avoid the supposition that each and every\r\nissue that has to do with or has an effect on international\r\npeace and security must be dealt with at the level of the\r\nSecurity Council. In fact, there are situations in which the\r\nGeneral Assembly may be able to play a significant role.\r\nThis is a matter that the Charter stipulates.\r\nMy delegation feels that, in respect of matters affecting\r\ninternational peace and security, there is a need for more\r\ncontact and dialogue between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. In addition, the Security Council’s\r\nnegotiating process should be made more transparent, more\r\nopen, and the States that are not members of the Council\r\nmust be consulted. The Council should listen to the views\r\nof a wider sector of the States Members of the Organization.\r\nIn this context, I must say that the report the Security\r\nCouncil should submit to the General Assembly, as required\r\nby the Charter, is an important document that should be less\r\ngeneral and more substantive. There is undoubtedly an\r\nurgent need for keeping the necessary balance between the\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly as stipulated by the\r\nCharter. While some situations concerning peace and\r\nsecurity can be dealt with by the General Assembly, which\r\nhas a key role to play, others might well be entrusted to\r\nregional organizations, which could, thereby, take on a pre-\r\neminent role.\r\nOur desire to formulate an effective plan for peace\r\nrequires that we revitalize the role of the General Assembly\r\nin safeguarding peace by ensuring that optimum use is made\r\nof the potential that the Charter provides for that purpose.\r\nWe must also have a clear perception of the role of regional\r\norganizations, of the manner in which they can support the\r\nwork of the United Nations and of their mutually supportive\r\nfunctions. It is practice alone that will enable us to ensure\r\nharmonious integration of the roles played by the Security\r\nCouncil, by the General Assembly, by regional organizations\r\nand by the Secretariat.\r\nThe delegation of Egypt supports the effort to\r\nrestructure the United Nations and revitalize its role in the\r\neconomic and social spheres and stresses that any\r\nrestructuring in those two areas must be aimed at promoting\r\ninternational cooperation for development and that any\r\nreform of the United Nations bodies should be geared to the\r\npromotion of that cooperation so that the Organization may\r\nbecome more responsive to the current realities and the\r\nchanges that are taking place in the world so that it may\r\nrespond to the requirements of development in the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMy delegation also affirms that an agenda for\r\ndevelopment should be given the same high profile as the\r\n\"Agenda for Peace\". In fact, the former should be\r\ncomplementary to the latter, as development is a\r\nprecondition for peace and is, thus, one of the essential\r\nelements of preventive diplomacy.\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMy delegation welcomes the tendency to increase the\r\ntransparency of the Secretariat’s activities and supports its\r\nrestructuring in order to enhance its capability to deal with\r\nthe increasing tasks entrusted to it. We support all efforts in\r\nthat respect. Egypt feels, however, that the process of\r\nrestructuring should not run counter to the priorities set for\r\nthe Organization by its Member States. On the contrary, it\r\nshould contribute to the promotion of those priorities. This\r\nwill be made possible only by the promotion of full\r\nconsultation on a permanent basis between the Secretariat\r\nand the Member States before and during all the stages of\r\nrestructuring.\r\nEgypt feels that any comprehensive and objective\r\nassessment of the Organization’s ability to function\r\nefficiently will depend in large part on the extent to which\r\nMember States will honour their financial commitments to\r\nit, on time.\r\nFinally, we feel that the problems that beset our world\r\nare universal both in their scope and in their effects.\r\nConsequently, dealing with such problems requires\r\ninternational efforts if we are to come up with solutions that\r\nwould ensure the emergence of the new international order\r\nwe aspire after. The balance and justice we hope for in such\r\nan order will be ensured only through the political will of all\r\nMember States and their commitment to international\r\ncooperation and all-embracing dialogue.\r\nMr. RAHMAN (Malaysia): We welcome this\r\nopportunity to participate in the debate on the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on the work of the Organization.\r\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General on this document,\r\nwhich, in many respects, could be described as a report on\r\nthe state of the United Nations in 1992. The\r\nSecretary-General has pre-empted delegations with his\r\nadmission that it is the longest such report to be presented\r\nin many years. Its length notwithstanding, the report gives\r\nan overview and makes specific references to the theme,\r\nthrust and status of the various activities undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations. The document is comprehensive, yet\r\nsuccinct. Indeed, together with the speech of the President\r\nof the General Assembly, it has set the tone and tenor of\r\ndebate for the current session. This process was enriched by\r\nthe statements of all our leaders in the general debate.\r\nMalaysia has consistently drawn attention to the need\r\nfor a strong and effective United Nations. We have always\r\nmaintained that it is necessary to abide by the spirit and\r\nsubstance of the United Nations Charter. Together with\r\nother countries, we have watched the United Nations as it\r\nhas played a truly effective role in the promotion of\r\ninternational peace, security and development. We agree\r\nwith this observation in the Secretary-General’s report:\r\n\"Only the United Nations has the universal character,\r\nthe global convening power and the extensive networks\r\nwhich cover virtually every international function\".\r\n(A/48/1, para. 18)\r\nAfter all, the United Nations is the apex of the\r\nintergovernmental, multilateral process.\r\nWe realize that, despite dramatic and qualitative\r\ndevelopments affecting the Organization and the international\r\nscene, change within the United Nations and in inter-State\r\nrelations conducted within the United Nations system cannot\r\nhappen overnight; neither can it be revolutionary. Change\r\nwill have to be a process conditioned by time and many\r\nother factors. However, one thing is certain: there must be\r\nchange. We must not make any irreversible mistake that\r\nwill make posterity condemn us for not living up to the\r\nhistoric opportunity, or as the report refers to it, the \"turning-\r\npoint\".\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization clearly indicates the readiness of the\r\nSecretary-General to undertake the necessary changes in the\r\nOrganization. While we would be supportive of the\r\ninitiatives of the Secretary-General and his team, we renew\r\nour appeal at the same time for the widest amount of\r\nconsultation to be attempted in the process. The\r\nSecretary-General will no doubt be exposed to many views,\r\nsome views more persuasive than others. The end of the\r\ncold war and the changing times do not mean the end of the\r\npursuit of primacy of positions and ideas. We are aware that\r\nthose who have profited from the United Nations as it was\r\nstructured in 1945 will resist change and continue to\r\nperpetuate their advantage. In the circumstances, it is\r\nincumbent on the countries of the South and other\r\nlike-minded countries, collectively and individually, to hold\r\nstrong to their collective views. In this regard we are happy\r\nthat the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement has also\r\naddressed this meeting.\r\nThe United Nations of the future, must clearly be on\r\nthe side of the world’s majority. It must be attentive to and\r\ncaring about the problems of that majority. Any change in\r\nthe United Nations through restructuring or revitalization\r\nmust result in maximizing the opportunity for the South and\r\nthe third world to place their problems before the United\r\nNations for attention and redress. It is in that context that\r\nwe in the South must make our views known as much as\r\npossible. The few should not be allowed to continue to\r\ninfluence the United Nations. As we stated in the debate on\r\n30th meeting - Thursday, 14 October l993 23\r\nthe same subject last year, we should set targets - perhaps\r\nby 1995 - for discernible and constructive changes within the\r\nUnited Nations to be firmly set in train.\r\nMalaysia is convinced that the future credibility and\r\neffectiveness of the concept of collective security and the\r\nUnited Nations role in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security require greater use of the mechanism for\r\npreventive diplomacy. This will be possible if there is\r\nstrong support for the Secretary-General and the Security\r\nCouncil to undertake proactive actions, early actions to\r\nevaluate conflict situations and undertake decisive moves to\r\nprevent the outbreak of open conflicts. But Member States\r\nwill give their support only if there is sufficient confidence\r\nand trust especially in the actions of the Security Council,\r\nsomething which has to be acquired over time.\r\nIn this regard too, it is important that the Security\r\nCouncil be seen to implement some of its own resolutions.\r\nThis is particularly relevant in the case of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. It is being increasingly seen that the Security\r\nCouncil has been less than effective in implementing its own\r\ndecisions on Bosnia and Herzegovina, while reacting\r\npromptly to other issues. The Security Council has failed in\r\nits duty towards Bosnia and Herzegovina and yet has\r\nprevented the Government and people of that country from\r\ndefending themselves by refusing to lift the arms embargo.\r\nMy delegation therefore fully endorses the position that\r\nthe principles of the Charter must be applied consistently,\r\nnot selectively, for if the perception should be of the latter,\r\ntrust would wane and with it the moral authority which is\r\nthe greatest and unique quality of that instrument. The\r\nUnited Nations effectiveness in preventing and settling\r\nconflicts and preserving international peace is dependent on\r\nthe credibility of its decisions and the degree of consistency\r\nin the application of the principles of the Charter. In the\r\nspirit of the Charter and the interests of Member States,\r\nthere has to be harmonization in the relationship between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council on the question\r\nof peace and security. We must not have a situation where\r\nthe views of the general membership of the United Nations\r\nare ignored and the Council chooses to apply principles only\r\nwhen it suits the interests and convenience of certain\r\nprominent members.\r\nAs we stated during the debate at the forty-seventh\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly, we are not\r\nhappy over the absence of a balanced, mutually reinforcing\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly. There should be a greater role for the General\r\nAssembly and more regular and closer consultations between\r\nthe general membership and the Security Council in matters\r\nrelating to peace and security. We welcome some of the\r\nrecent initiatives undertaken by the Security Council towards\r\ntransparency and consultation with non-members of the\r\nCouncil. It is our belief that this process should be\r\ncontinued and strengthened.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General to the forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly includes five main chapters,\r\nnamely: I. Introduction; II. Coordinating a Comprehensive\r\nStrategy; III. Developing the Global Community; IV.\r\nExpanding Preventive Diplomacy, Humanitarian Assistance\r\nand Conflict Resolution; and V. Conclusion: Strengthening\r\nthe Human Foundation. A considerable part of the report is\r\ndevoted to peace-keeping and other related aspects. This\r\nimplicitly reflects the preoccupation of the United Nations in\r\n1992.\r\nMalaysia, a developing country, has endeavoured to\r\nplay its role as a United Nations Member, among other\r\nthings, through its contribution to the United Nations\r\npeace-keeping activities. We are involved in a number of\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping and field missions. Our\r\npeace-keepers are in many parts of the world, including\r\nSomalia, where we have suffered loss of life as well. While\r\nwe look forward to the full debate on the specific item of\r\npeace-keeping, we wish to state at this juncture that troop-\r\ncontributing countries need to be kept fully informed of\r\nspecific operations. Unity of command and clarity of\r\nmandate are key elements in any successful peace-keeping\r\nmission. For any peace-keeping operation to be truly\r\nrepresentative of the international community, the active\r\nparticipation of developing countries is critical. It is equally\r\nimportant that contributions from all countries be accepted,\r\nrather than using a selective approach which may give rise\r\nto concerns of discrimination.\r\nThe stress on peace-keeping and related activities has\r\nhad a direct impact on the state of the finances of the United\r\nNations. It has adversely affected the United Nations\r\noperational activities and overall raised fundamental\r\nquestions relating to the United Nations role in the area of\r\ndevelopment. It is envisaged that, if the present trend\r\ncontinues, the ratio of expenditure on peace-keeping to the\r\nUnited Nations operational and development activities may\r\nwell be of the order of 4:1. We recall yet again our appeal\r\nlast year for an agenda for development. \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\" without being complemented by an agenda for\r\ndevelopment will not effectively contribute to international\r\npeace and security. The proposed agenda for development\r\nwould no doubt have to take into account all activities and\r\ninitiatives, including Agenda 21, so as to ensure that there is\r\nno duplication.\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn the context of development activities, we wish to\r\nreiterate our view that there is a need for a clear linkage\r\nbetween the results of Bretton Woods meetings and the\r\ninitiatives taken at the United Nations. The world majority\r\nrepresented in the United Nations must have a say in the\r\ncritical decisions taken by bodies such as Bretton Woods and\r\nthe Group of Seven. The decisions taken at Bretton Woods\r\ncan no longer be taken in isolation, out of step with the\r\ncollective needs expressed at the United Nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report is optimistic about the\r\nvarious initiatives undertaken since the Rio Earth Summit in\r\nJune 1992. Malaysia fully supports the observations\r\ncontained in the report. We wish, however, to stress that all\r\nthose initiatives must be based on successful collective\r\nefforts to ensure the means of implementation through\r\ntechnology transfers and financial flows. Without such\r\nmeans of implementation the various programmes and\r\nactivities in Agenda 21 and the various negotiating processes\r\nwould be seriously impaired.\r\nMalaysia looks forward to working with all countries in\r\naddressing the financial crisis of the United Nations. We\r\nagree that regular and predictable financial resources, as well\r\nas well-trained manpower, are important ingredients if the\r\nUnited Nations is to discharge its responsibilities. Cost-\r\ncutting measures designed to promote greater efficiency and\r\nincreased productivity are to be welcomed. Such measures,\r\nhowever, should enjoy the support of United Nations\r\nMembers. There are various proposals put forward to\r\nstrengthen the financial base of the United Nations and we\r\nlook forward to their elaboration in the Fifth Committee.\r\nGiven the set of issues raised in the report, and in view\r\nof time constraints, my delegation would wish to comment\r\non other issues in the appropriate Committees or as and\r\nwhen a specific issue is raised in the Assembly.\r\nORGANIZATION OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Before adjourning the meeting I\r\nshould like to inform members that, due to the lateness of\r\nthe hour and the large number of Member States inscribed\r\non the list of speakers, the General Assembly will hear the\r\nlast 11 speakers under agenda item 10 tomorrow morning, as\r\nthe third item in the agenda.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
