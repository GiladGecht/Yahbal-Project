GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.31\r\n8 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nperiod 1 August 1992 to 31 July 1993; this report is\r\ncontained in document A/48/4.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of\r\nthe report of the International Court of Justice?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on Sir Robert Yewdall\r\nJennings, President of the International Court of Justice, to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nSir Robert YEWDALL JENNINGS (President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice): The International Court of\r\nJustice continues to have a full docket of cases: there are at\r\npresent 11 cases at various stages of the procedure. Recent\r\nadditions to the list are the case between Hungary and\r\nSlovakia over the Danube dams; and the request from the\r\nWorld Health Organization for an advisory opinion\r\nconcerning the use of nuclear weapons - the only\r\nadvisory-opinion request in the docket at present.\r\nTwice during this last year the Court has had to deal\r\nwith complicated and lengthy requests for interim measures\r\nof protection in the case brought by Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nagainst Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) concerning the\r\nGenocide Convention. Such requests for interim measures,\r\naccording to the Court’s rules, \"have priority over all other\r\ncases\". These two separate requests were such requests, and\r\nthe Court dealt with them immediately and with dispatch:\r\nthe first was handled in some three weeks, and the second in\r\nonly a little longer time - that period including in both\r\ninstances time for an oral hearing in which both parties were\r\nheard and for the study of several lengthy written\r\nobservations.\r\nParticulars of the Court’s decisions and also of the\r\ncases in its docket are given, as members of the General\r\nAssembly will know, not only in the Court’s own report but\r\nalso in chapter II, section A of the 1993 report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the organization (A/48/1).\r\nI can now add that on 14 June final judgment was\r\ngiven, by 14 votes to 1, in the important case between\r\nDenmark and Norway - a further case arising from a\r\nunilateral application by Denmark, basing jurisdiction on the\r\n\"optional clause\" of Article 36 of the Court’s Statute -\r\nconcerning the maritime boundary between the east coast of\r\nGreenland and the Norwegian island of Jan Mayen. There\r\nhave been indications that the Court’s judgment in that case\r\nis perceived by both parties as a satisfactory final settlement\r\nof a dispute which protracted negotiations had failed to\r\nsettle.\r\nOne case, between Nauru and Australia, in which a\r\njurisdictional phase was decided last year, was last month\r\nthe subject of a carefully drawn settlement out of court,\r\nresulting in the withdrawal of the case from the Court’s list.\r\nIt will be remembered that last year I was able to report that\r\nthe Great Belt case between Finland and Denmark had been\r\nsettled, indeed almost on the eve of the scheduled oral\r\nproceedings, in negotiations which had been suggested and\r\nencouraged by the Court itself.\r\nThere is another case on the Court’s list in which\r\nnegotiations are active, the Court having been asked by both\r\nParties to grant a delay in the procedures to enable the\r\nnegotiations to continue in order to see whether it might be\r\npossible to reach a settlement.\r\nI mention these settled cases, and the case still the\r\nsubject of ongoing negotiations, because they illustrate a new\r\nrole for the Court, unimagined by earlier commentators on\r\nthe adjudication process in international matters. In all these\r\ninstances of settlement, or attempted settlement, by\r\nnegotiations after the time when the Court has been seized\r\nof a case, some part of the procedures of the Court, such as\r\nwritten pleadings, or indeed a hearing and decision in a\r\npreliminary phase, such as jurisdiction or interim measures,\r\nhad been completed. Thus, it was the intervention of some\r\npart of the procedures before the Court which apparently not\r\nonly made further negotiations in this new context possible\r\nbut made it possible for them to succeed.\r\nIn this way, the Court procedure is beginning to be seen\r\nas a resort to be employed in a closer relationship with\r\nnormal diplomatic negotiation. No longer is resort to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice seen, to use the traditional\r\nphrase, as a \"last resort\" when all negotiation has finally\r\nfailed. Rather, it is sometimes now to be seen as a recourse\r\nthat might usefully be employed at an earlier stage of the\r\ndispute. I suppose a foretaste of this development was the\r\n1969 North Sea Continental Shelf cases, where the Court, by\r\ndeciding a legal question that had been a sticking-point,\r\nenabled normal negotiations to start again and to resolve the\r\nmatter in a way acceptable to all parties concerned. This\r\ntendency to use the Court, acting under its contentious\r\njurisdiction, as a partner in preventive diplomacy rather than\r\nas a last-resort alternative is after all only to conform to the\r\nplace that courts enjoy in any developed domestic system of\r\nlaw.\r\nThe perception of the International Court of Justice as\r\na normal, rather than as an extraordinary, part of\r\ninternational relations may perhaps also be reflected in the\r\nfact that the number of declarations of acceptance of the\r\nCourt’s jurisdiction under paragraph 2 of Article 36 - the\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 3\r\noptional clause - of the Court’s Statute is still on a slow but\r\ncontinual upward trend. The total of such acceptances is\r\nnow 57 out of the 184 Member States. There have also\r\nbeen several additions to the list of treaties with jurisdiction\r\nclauses.\r\nIt is an interesting development, the significance of\r\nwhich I do not attempt to comment upon here, that the\r\nincreased busyness of the Court is still the result almost\r\nentirely of cases brought under the contentious jurisdiction\r\nand that States show more eagerness to use the Court than\r\ndo those international organizations entitled to ask for\r\nadvisory opinions.\r\nWhilst speaking of decisions in contentious cases, I\r\nshould like to say something about the notion one sometimes\r\nhears that contentious proceedings before the full\r\nInternational Court of Justice take rather a long time. It is\r\ntrue that the period between the application and the judgment\r\nis usually one to be measured in years rather than months.\r\nBut, in almost all cases, the greater part of that time is taken\r\nup by the parties themselves in the preparation and study of\r\ntwo or sometimes three rounds of elaborate written\r\npleadings, followed by oral proceedings in which the parties\r\nusually expect to be allowed to talk for typically three or\r\nfour weeks. So the time actually taken by the Court for\r\ndeliberation and drafting of a judgment is relatively short.\r\nI am not suggesting that the parties necessarily take too long\r\nover the preparation of written pleadings and the provision\r\nof documentation. The cases we get are very important\r\ncases and Governments naturally wish to take time over the\r\npreparations leading towards a decision that will be final and\r\nis without appeal. It is perhaps also relevant here to mention\r\nthe fact that the Court’s standing Chamber of Summary\r\nProcedure has never been employed even though it has\r\nremained continuously in being.\r\nTo give some idea of the dimensions of some of the\r\ncases, let me instance the one which is now in the hands of\r\nthe Court for decision: the very important territorial dispute\r\nChad/Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, brought to the Court by the\r\nAgreement of 31 August 1990. The written pleadings in that\r\ncase amount to some 30 stout volumes of argument and\r\ndocumentation, and the phase of written pleadings was then\r\nfollowed by five weeks of oral hearings. The documentation\r\nis remarkable, for the case involves long periods of colonial\r\nhistory in Africa and both parties have been able to use the\r\nrelevant British, French and Italian archives. Quite apart\r\nfrom the need for the Judges to read and study this vast if\r\nalso fascinating array of material, almost every word of it,\r\nof course, had to be translated into the other language of the\r\nCourt. The time-consuming nature of this exercise is\r\nevident, and certainly the Court has been working recently\r\nunder very great pressure.\r\nAll these things considered, one is justified in saying\r\nthat the Court itself really works remarkably quickly, and the\r\ntime taken will be found in any event, I believe, to compare\r\nfavourably with other superior courts of both domestic and\r\ninternational jurisdiction.\r\nAll of the cases at present on the list are cases brought\r\nbefore the full Court. The Court has, however, found time\r\nto establish a Chamber for Environmental Matters, in the\r\nbelief that some litigants might prefer a Chamber composed\r\nof Judges who have expressed a special interest in such\r\nmatters. It may be useful, however, to make it clear that the\r\nestablishment of this Chamber for Environmental Matters is\r\nin no way intended to suggest that cases involving\r\nenvironmental matters should go to that Chamber, or any\r\nother Chamber, rather than the full Court. The jurisdiction\r\nof the full Court obviously comprehends environmental\r\nmatters, as indeed it comprehends any other question of\r\ninternational law. Furthermore, to take a contentious-\r\njurisdiction case to a Chamber will normally require\r\nagreement of the parties to do so, whereas the full Court\r\nmight have jurisdiction, whether under paragraph 2 of\r\nArticle 36 of the Statute or under some treaty-jurisdiction\r\nclause, in a case brought by unilateral application. And,\r\nnaturally, it would be the normal course to address any\r\nrequest for an advisory opinion to the full Court.\r\nI like to think that the new busyness of the International\r\nCourt of Justice is at least in part connected with a more\r\nrealistic appreciation of the place and function of a court of\r\njustice in a society governed by the rule of law.\r\nTraditionally, the writers and commentators used to put\r\nbefore us what they conceived of as an ideal situation in\r\nwhich all disputes would be submitted for settlement to a\r\ncourt. I think there is now much more appreciation that\r\nsome disputes require political decisions by a political body.\r\nSuch a body will of course work within the framework of\r\nthe law, but the reasons for the decision will be political\r\nrather than legal. This, of course, is the scheme of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, and the fact that that scheme is now\r\nbeing put into operation in a way that has not until recently\r\nbeen practicable helps us to see the Court - the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations - in a new and\r\naltogether more realistic context. People are much more\r\nlikely to resort to the Court if they have a clear idea of what\r\nit can and should do, and what it cannot do.\r\nIt is here that I should like to express the pleasure and\r\ngratitude of all members of the Court for the terms in which\r\nthe use of the Court is recommended in the resolution of the\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nGeneral Assembly on the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe work of the Organization. It is most encouraging to see\r\nthe use of the Court thus supported clearly in the general\r\ncontext of \"An Agenda for Peace\" and as a component of\r\nthe scheme of preventive diplomacy.\r\nI cannot leave this theme of the role of the International\r\nCourt of Justice without a mention of today’s tendency to\r\nproliferate other and specialized courts and tribunals. We\r\nmay soon have three in The Hague alone: the International\r\nCourt of Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and the\r\nnew international criminal court for crimes committed in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. The relationship of these tribunals to\r\neach other and to each other’s jurisdiction, and their\r\nrespective contributions to the directions taken by the\r\ndevelopment of international law by the resulting case law\r\nfrom their decisions, raise interesting and difficult questions\r\nwhich might at some time have to be addressed. There is\r\nonly one thought I wish to leave with the members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on this occasion: there can be only one\r\n\"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\", as there is\r\nnormally only one supreme court of any legally ordered\r\ncommunity; and that position of the International Court of\r\nJustice ought always to be remembered and strenuously\r\nprotected.\r\nThis is probably my last appearance before the General\r\nAssembly as President of the Court. I want to thank the\r\nSecretary-General and to thank you, Mr. President, and the\r\nmembers of the General Assembly for their immensely\r\nvaluable support to the Court and to its work. This has been\r\nof very great importance to the Court in this time of\r\nexpansion of its work and of the addressing of the difficult\r\nproblems of staffing and premises brought about by that very\r\nexpansion.\r\nMr. HAAKONSEN (Denmark): So far there has been\r\nno tradition for opening a debate on the annual report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. The reasons may be twofold:\r\nfor many years, there were very few cases, if any, to report\r\non; and as the Court is the highest judicial organ of the\r\nworld community, it may not have seemed appropriate for\r\nthe General Assembly to pronounce any opinion on the\r\ndisputes decided with binding effect once and for all by the\r\nCourt. However, times have changed. States appear\r\nnowadays to be more ready to submit their disputes, inclu-\r\nding politically sensitive ones, to the Court in order to obtain\r\na final and legally binding settlement of the matter. This\r\ntrend is clearly shown in the Court’s report (A/48/4), now\r\nbefore the General Assembly. In addition, the Court’s role\r\nin furthering the international legal order may be commented\r\nupon without interfering with the Court’s exclusive\r\ncompetence.\r\nAs can be seen from this year’s report, the Court is\r\ngradually fulfilling its role as the principal judicial organ of\r\nthe United Nations. The steadily increasing number of cases\r\nbrought before it bears witness to this fact. This is\r\nparticularly satisfying when seen in the context of the United\r\nNations Decade of International Law (1990-1999), during\r\nwhich special attention will be given to the role of the Court\r\nboth in settling inter-State disputes and as an instrument of\r\npreventive diplomacy through its advisory functions.\r\nThrough the jurisprudence of the Court, the rule of law is\r\ngaining further ground within the international community of\r\nStates, and that is exactly one of the main objectives of the\r\nDecade - and beyond.\r\nIt should always be kept in mind that bringing a dispute\r\nbefore the Court can never be regarded as an unfriendly act.\r\nIf diplomacy and negotiations cannot bring about a solution\r\nto a long-standing contentious issue between States, the\r\nCourt in The Hague has proven itself capable of handling its\r\nmany cases in a flexible and efficient manner. In this\r\nrespect, it is to be welcomed that the Court has now\r\nestablished a seven-member standing Chamber for\r\nEnvironmental Matters. This topic is indeed one of the\r\nhigh-priority items on the international agenda. Denmark\r\ncan testify to the Court’s ability in so far as the Danish\r\nGovernment has been involved in two cases before the Court\r\nwithin the last five years: the Jan Mayen case and the Great\r\nBelt case. In both cases, the Court has served justice in\r\naccordance with the high expectations placed on it by the\r\nparties. Thus I can confirm what was expressed just now by\r\nthe President of the Court.\r\nA particular aspect relating to the Great Belt case is\r\nworth highlighting, namely the role of the Court in\r\nmaintaining the option of reaching a negotiated settlement.\r\nIn deciding a preliminary question concerning provisional\r\nmeasures, the Court indicated at the same time that a\r\nnegotiated settlement would be welcomed. That indication\r\nproved helpful in reaching an out-of-court settlement.\r\nThough out-of-court, the settlement was still reached under\r\nthe Court’s auspices. The President of the Court expressed\r\nthis view in the following way when introducing the annual\r\nreport of the International Court of Justice (A/47/4) during\r\nlast year’s session of the General Assembly:\r\n\"Whenever the Court or its procedures can help in this\r\nway, the Court is, in an important sense, still\r\nproductively at work.\" (A/47/PV.43, p. 11)\r\nThe question may be raised as to whether the Court\r\nought to be empowered to play a more active role in\r\noffering its assistance to the parties, as appropriate, with a\r\nview to keeping the door open for reaching a negotiated\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 5\r\nsettlement - because whenever there is agreement between\r\nthe parties, there is also equity.\r\nThe Court has shown that it is prepared to deal with all\r\nsorts of cases. It is now up to States to show their\r\nwillingness to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the\r\nCourt. One hundred eighty-six States are parties to the\r\nStatute of the Court, but only 57 have recognized its\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction, and among those is only one\r\npermanent member of the Security Council. We hope that\r\nMember States will pay due attention to these facts as they\r\nare set out in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the report.\r\nIt is the hope of my Government that in the years to\r\ncome this agenda item may be seen by Member States as an\r\nopportunity to comment upon the role and functioning of the\r\nworld Court in furthering an effective international legal\r\norder. Settlement of disputes through peaceful means,\r\nincluding the use of the International Court of Justice, should\r\nbecome a normal and acceptable feature in daily\r\ninternational life, as is the case in all national societies\r\ngoverned by the rule of law.\r\nMr. ROWE (Australia): The Australian delegation\r\nwishes to thank the distinguished President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for his excellent report and\r\nenlightening statement. The role of the Court, as the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, is today more\r\nimportant than ever, as so much more is expected of the\r\nUnited Nations in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe United Nations Decade of International Law, now\r\nin its second biennium, provides an appropriate context for\r\nStates to reassess in a positive way their approach to\r\nacceptance of the jurisdiction of the International Court of\r\nJustice, with a view to promoting the Court as a means for\r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes.\r\nIn his report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277), the\r\nSecretary-General has expressed the view that greater\r\nreliance on the Court could contribute significantly to\r\npreventive diplomacy. This view was amplifled only last\r\nweek by the President of the Court, when he reminded us in\r\nhis address to the Sixth Committee that the International\r\nCourt of Justice is an integral component of the United\r\nNations system aimed at the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe Secretary-General has called upon all Member\r\nStates to accept the general jurisdiction of the Court before\r\nthe end of the Decade of International Law. Where\r\nunconditional acceptance of general jurisdiction of the Court\r\nis not considered possible, the Secretary-General has\r\nsuggested that States might agree to a comprehensive list of\r\nthose matters in which the Court’s jurisdiction is accepted\r\nand might provide for submission of disputes to the Court in\r\nthe dispute settlement clauses of multilateral treaties.\r\nAustralia supports the views expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General. The International Court of Justice has\r\nbeen under-utilized for much of its existence, though there\r\nhas recently been an encouraging trend towards more\r\nfrequent recourse to the Court, as the President mentioned in\r\nhis statement this morning. To date, however, fewer than 60\r\nStates have accepted its compulsory jurisdiction. One of the\r\nbest ways to promote the use of the Court as an effective\r\ndispute-resolution mechanism is for Member States to make\r\nthe individual decision, under Article 36 of the Statute, to\r\naccept its compulsory jurisdiction. The fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which will coincide with the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Court, might provide a timely occasion\r\nfor the recording of progress on movement towards\r\nacceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction.\r\nWe note that in \"An Agenda for Peace\" and more\r\nrecently in his report on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/48/1), the Secretary-General has recommended that he be\r\nauthorized to take advantage of the advisory competence of\r\nthe Court. Commenting on this issue in his recent\r\npublication, Cooperating for Peace, the Australian Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, wrote:\r\n\"The Court has been wary of efforts by the UN’s\r\npolitical organs to tempt it to render advisory opinions\r\non contentious cases without the consent of the parties.\r\nThat said, the ICJ has been influential both in dispute\r\nand conflict resolution and in assisting the activities of\r\nother actors in the international security community,\r\nand could become a more valuable adjunct for the\r\nSecretary-General in extending the range of responses\r\navailable in problem situations.\" (Cooperating for\r\nPeace: The Global Agenda for the 1990s and Beyond,\r\np. 27)\r\nWe know there is still some ongoing resistance to the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal, but not, we understand, from\r\nthe Court. It is time to give serious consideration to the\r\nproposal and to determine the modalities under which such\r\nauthorization could be granted.\r\nIn order to allow for greater recourse to the Court as an\r\neffective mechanism for dispute resolution, it will be\r\nessential that its procedures allow disputes brought before it\r\nto be considered as expeditiously and efficiently as possible.\r\nThe will of Member States to provide for the enhanced\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\neffectiveness of the International Court of Justice may in\r\ntime be expected to contribute constructively to a reduction\r\nin the tensions that result from and further aggravate\r\ndisputes between States. This would require that the Court\r\nhave the capacity to deal promptly with individual cases.\r\nIn his statement to the General Assembly last year, the\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice noted that a\r\nreview of its working methods would assist in improving its\r\nfunctioning and thereby promote its use. Such a review\r\nwould be of particular value against a background where\r\ngreater adherence to the jurisdiction of the Court is being\r\npromoted as a contribution to the preservation of peaceful\r\nrelations among States and where the Court is being given\r\nmore prominence as a dispute-settlement mechanism.\r\nAustralia favours such a review, which should take into\r\naccount the promotion of the wider acceptance of the\r\nCourt’s jurisdiction by the year of its fiftieth anniversary.\r\nWe note that use is being made of chambers, particularly in\r\nthe recent El Salvador-Honduras case, which is mentioned in\r\nthe report, and we would welcome further development of\r\nthis mechanism. The establishment of the trust fund to assist\r\ndeveloping countries in bringing cases to the Court has also\r\nbeen a useful innovation. Above all, it is essential that the\r\nCourt continue to be provided with adequate resources to\r\ncarry out its growing tasks. We wish it well, and we\r\nreiterate Australia’s commitment to it and to the cause of\r\ninternational justice.\r\nMr. TELLO (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMr. President, my delegation had asked to make a statement\r\nbefore the General Assembly took note of the report of the\r\nCourt. When you assumed the presidency of this session of\r\nthe Assembly, we pledged to work with you as you\r\ndischarged your functions. You personally asked me to\r\nmake my statement after the Assembly had taken note of the\r\nreport. In response to your request, we agreed to speak\r\nafterwards, although we do not fully understand or share the\r\narguments that we have heard, which apparently prevent\r\nMember States from speaking at the time they deem most appropriate.\r\nMy delegation wishes to place on record its gratitude to\r\nSir Robert Jennings for his comprehensive and lucidly\r\ninstructive introduction to the report submitted by the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for the General Assembly’s\r\nconsideration.\r\nOn the eve of the election of the new members of the\r\nCourt, my delegation wishes to pay tribute to\r\nManfred Lachs. We are appreciative of Judge Lachs’ long\r\ncareer dedicated to the development of international law,\r\nboth inside and outside the Court, and of the invaluable\r\nimpartiality and independence of his judgements, not to\r\nmention his valuable contributions to the teaching of law.\r\nThe Sixth Committee was honoured to have Lachs as its\r\nChairman on three occasions.\r\nMexico is one of the 57 States the report identifies as\r\nhaving made the declaration recognizing the compulsory\r\njurisdiction of the Court, in accordance with\r\nparagraphs 2 and 5 of Article 36 of the Statute. We wish to\r\ncongratulate Hungary, which deposited its declaration on\r\n22 October 1992. Even though judgeships on the Court are\r\nnot limited to nationals of those States that have made such\r\na declaration, it is no doubt true that when that condition is\r\nmet the Court’s image is strengthened, as is countries’\r\ncommitment to and confidence in the Court.\r\nMy Government deems it desirable for the States that\r\nhave, within the United Nations system, the greatest\r\nresponsibility regarding international peace and security to\r\nshow a greater commitment to the Court. The limited\r\npresence of the permanent members of the Security Council\r\nand that group of 57 States does not have a positive effect\r\non the Court’s work, nor on the necessary balance that must\r\nexist between the principal organs of the United Nations.\r\nThe Court’s efficacy and capacity for action would no doubt\r\nbe strengthened considerably if all the permanent members\r\nof the Security Council made such a declaration.\r\nIn the light of the terms of paragraph 2 of Article 15 of\r\nthe Charter, by which the General Assembly must receive\r\nand consider the reports of the International Court of Justice,\r\nmy delegation deems it appropriate to speak on this item.\r\nThe Mexican delegation considers that the General Assembly\r\nmust fulfil completely the function assigned it by the\r\nCharter, and so we call on Member States to give this\r\nimportant report greater attention.\r\nThe Mexican delegation invites the General Assembly\r\nto take advantage of the introduction of the report of the\r\nCourt to take part every year in deep reflection on its work\r\nand on the state of its links and relations with the other\r\norgans.\r\nWe still believe that the Court’s participation in the\r\npeaceful settlement of international conflicts deserves to be\r\nstepped up. Recourse to the Security Council when the\r\nCourt’s means have not yet been exhausted minimizes the\r\nlatter’s potential to resolve legal problems, which sometimes\r\nconstitute the crux of potential crises. This view could and\r\nshould be of special usefulness in strengthening preventive\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 7\r\nWith that very intention, a number of States, including\r\nMexico, have supported the Secretary-General’s suggestion\r\nthat he be granted the competence to request advisory\r\nopinions from the Court, when circumstances warrant and in\r\naccordance with the precise modalities of the principles of\r\nthe Charter and of international law.\r\nMy delegation takes special satisfaction in noting the\r\never-growing number of legal consultants taking part in the\r\nconsideration of the report of the International Law\r\nCommission, owing to the determination a year in advance\r\nof the date for dealing with that subject. In the light of that\r\nexperience and in order to facilitate attendance by the\r\ngreatest number of interested persons to the introduction of\r\nthe Court’s report, my delegation proposes that the date for\r\nreceiving and considering the report of that principal organ\r\nalso be set in advance and that both reports be submitted to\r\nthe Assembly’s consideration within a period of time that\r\nallows those persons to be present.\r\nI wish also to mention the Trust Fund established by\r\nthe Secretary-General to help States settle disputes through\r\nthe International Court of Justice and to which my country\r\nhas contributed. In addition to providing the necessary\r\nfinancial support in order for countries facing economic\r\ndifficulties to be able to have resort to the Court, my\r\ndelegation would like to invite the members of the Court and\r\nthe Secretary-General to consider the possibility of utilizing\r\npart of that Trust Fund for the development of training\r\nprogrammes for lawyers appearing before the International\r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nFinally, my delegation cannot fail to mention the fact\r\nthat in 1995 the Court, too, will celebrate its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. We think it would be fitting for the Assembly\r\nto invite the judges to reflect on the role that the Court, as\r\nthe guarantor of international law, is called upon to play in\r\nthe next century and to share their conclusions with Member\r\nStates at the next session of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. KOROMA (Sierra Leone): First of all, may I\r\nexpress the gratitude and appreciation of the Sierra Leone\r\ndelegation to Sir Robert Jennings, President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, for the excellent statement he\r\ndelivered when introducing the report of the International\r\nCourt of Justice. My delegation also wishes to convey its\r\nsentiments of recognition and esteem to the other judges\r\nwho are here with us.\r\nThis annual pilgrimage, as it were, is an affirmation of\r\nthe Charter provision that the International Court of Justice\r\nis not only the judicial organ but also an inseparable\r\ncomponent of the United Nations.\r\nThe presence of the Court here is a further\r\nreaffirmation of the shared, noble objective of the General\r\nAssembly and the International Court of Justice to resolve\r\ninternational disputes in a peaceful manner. Such an\r\nobjective is not only enshrined in the Charter but is also\r\nfirmly rooted in the shared goal of maintaining international\r\npeace and resolving international disputes through peaceful\r\nmeans. In that connection, and as the Secretary-General has\r\nstated in his report on the work of the Organization to the\r\npresent session of the General Assembly, the incidence of\r\ncases of considerable political as well as legal importance\r\nunder consideration by the Court shows that the Court not\r\nonly exists to settle questions of law, but is also an integral\r\npart of United Nations peace efforts.\r\nThe continued role of the Court in this area is to be\r\nwelcomed for, as stipulated in Article 33 of the Charter,\r\n\"The parties to any dispute, the continuance of\r\nwhich is likely to endanger the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, shall, first of all, seek\r\na solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation,\r\nconciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement ...\".\r\nAs I have said, we welcome the role of the Court in the\r\npeace effort.\r\nThrough the report itself and in the President’s\r\nintroductory statement the international community has been\r\nmade aware of the various methods and facilities that are\r\navailable through the Court for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes. The report states that last year alone the Court\r\ndealt with a wide range of disputes, including treaty\r\ninterpretation, territorial maritime disputes and disputes\r\nrelating to the alleged violation of human rights and\r\ninternational humanitarian law. It is gratifying to note not\r\nonly that today the vast majority of States have become\r\nParties to the Statute of the Court but also that, thanks to the\r\nrole and facilities it continues to offer, the Court has\r\nestablished its universality and more frequent use is being\r\nmade of it.\r\nToday, attitudes towards the Court have improved and\r\nsupport for its judicial role has continued to grow. Because\r\nof the high standards of fairness and impartiality the Court\r\nhas maintained in the recent past, the attitude of withdrawal\r\nonce adopted by many, including most developing countries,\r\nis largely a thing of the past, and we now realize that the\r\nCourt can apply international law impartially, that the\r\ninterests of the weak can be protected and that the principle\r\nof equality between States can best be realized through the\r\nCourt. Today, through its judgments, advisory opinions,\r\norders and interim measures - in some cases, as the\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncircumstances warrant, delivered with dispatch, as the\r\nPresident reminded us a few moments ago - the Court has\r\nbeen contributing not only to the strengthening of the rule of\r\nlaw among nations but also to a more orderly and humane\r\nworld.\r\nThe Sierra Leone delegation would like to encourage\r\nthe Court to continue to uphold legal norms which are\r\nprofoundly imbued with the sense of natural justice and\r\nmorality and which safeguard human rights and humanitarian\r\nlaw. My delegation welcomed the decision of the Court to\r\nestablish a Chamber for Environmental Matters in view of\r\nthe developments in the field of environmental law and the\r\ndevelopments that have taken place in the last few years, and\r\nconsidering that it should be prepared to the fullest extent\r\npossible to deal with any environmental case falling within\r\nits jurisdiction. However, my delegation also welcomes the\r\nassurance given by the President that the establishment of\r\nthe Environmental Chamber does not preclude the referral of\r\nenvironmental disputes to the old corpus of the Court.\r\nMy delegation reiterates its support for the\r\nestablishment of the Trust Fund, which should enable more\r\nparties to a dispute to take advantage of the facilities\r\nprovided by the Court.\r\nFinally, the Sierra Leone delegation would like to\r\nencourage the spirit of cooperation between the International\r\nCourt of Justice and the General Assembly, and we welcome\r\nthe report of the International Court of Justice.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 13?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 10 (continued)\r\nREPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE\r\nWORK OF THE ORGANIZATION (A/48/1)\r\nMr. AYEWAH (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation\r\nwould like to join other delegations that have congratulated\r\nthe Secretary-General on the lucidity and painstaking manner\r\nin which he has drawn up and presented his report.\r\nThere is no doubt that this report is, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has himself admitted, a long one, but he has clearly\r\nendeavoured to cover in a bold and imaginative manner all\r\nthe areas and activities in which the United Nations has been\r\ninvolved during the past year in response to the growing\r\ncomplexity and demands of the international environment.\r\nMy delegation has also taken note of the various\r\nprescriptions and recommendations by the Secretary-General\r\nin the report which are in themselves far reaching and\r\nwhich, if implemented faithfully, would go a long way\r\ntowards assisting the Organization to achieve the purpose for\r\nwhich it was created.\r\nThe United Nations is passing through a crucial phase\r\nin the multilateral process of harnessing our collective\r\nobjectives and aspirations to the common good. It would be\r\na disservice to the entire membership if the United Nations\r\ndid not endeavour to respond to them, even within the\r\nconstraints of the limited resources under which it is\r\noperating. Fortunately, there is no lack of ideas in the\r\nUnited Nations system. It is therefore our collective\r\nresponsibility to translate those ideas into concrete objectives\r\nwhich would be of benefit to Member States.\r\nIt is significant that the Secretary-General has\r\nunderscored in his report some of the critical problems\r\nconfronting the Organization in the areas of peace and\r\nsecurity, socio-economic development, the environment and\r\nthe restructuring of the various organs of the United Nations\r\nsystem. While my delegation would like to commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his wisdom and foresight in bringing\r\nthese issues to the fore, we wish to make the following\r\ncomments as our contribution to the debate on the subject.\r\nMy delegation agrees with the Secretary-General when\r\nhe posits that without peace there can be no development,\r\nand that without development the basis for democracy is\r\ntenuous. In this connection, we commend the United\r\nNations for its preoccupation with peace-keeping and\r\npeacemaking. We accept that the proliferation of hotbeds of\r\ntensions fuelled by ethnic rivalries, socio-economic\r\ndisparities, underdevelopment and the emergence of new\r\nmicro-nationalisms cannot but engage the attention of our\r\nOrganization. There is an urgent need to streamline the\r\nprocesses such that peace-keeping operations do not become\r\nintractable or interminable. Peace is a shared responsibility.\r\nConsequently, Member States must retain the necessary\r\npolitical will and ready disposition to contribute their quota\r\nto the enabling processes.\r\nIt is important also in this regard to take necessary\r\nmeasures to ensure the safety of all personnel involved in\r\npeace-keeping operations. My delegation would like to\r\nstress that countries which willingly offer to participate in\r\nthese operations do so as part of their obligations under the\r\nCharter and as their contribution to the mitigation of human\r\nsuffering. It would be tantamount to double jeopardy for\r\nsuch countries to suffer humiliation and abuse in addition to\r\nbearing the material costs for assigning their nationals to\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 9\r\nundertake these United Nations missions. In this connection,\r\nprompt and full reimbursement to contributing-troop\r\ncountries would encourage consistent and even wider\r\nparticipation by Member States in the United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nThe processes begun under \"An Agenda for Peace\",\r\nwhich has been a subject of debate in both the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, should provide\r\nadditional clarification of the nature and extent of\r\ndemilitarized zones, pre-emptive deployment and\r\npost-conflict peace-building in a manner that respects the\r\nsovereignty of all Member States and accepts the merits of\r\nprior consultations before such measures are undertaken. In\r\npursuing the purposes of \"An Agenda for Peace\", it is\r\ndesirable that the United Nations limit itself to preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. The issue of\r\npost-conflict peace-building involving efforts at putting in\r\nplace political processes in conflict areas requires caution\r\nand additional consideration.\r\nIn the wake of the adoption of \"An Agenda for Peace\",\r\nit has become urgent to work for the adoption of an agenda\r\nfor development. The issue of development is one in which\r\nevery Member State has a stake and a contribution to make.\r\nIn view of the widening disparities between the North and\r\nthe South, the adoption of an agenda for development must\r\nundertake as a first step to reactivate the North-South\r\ndialogue. Then it should address the issue of trade, official\r\ndevelopment assistance, the debt crisis and the injection of\r\nnew financial flows, especially into the economies of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nAs you are well aware, Africa remains the weakest link\r\nin the chain of development. It was in recognition of this\r\nfact that Africa’s economic crisis was brought to\r\ninternational attention in 1986 with the adoption of the\r\nUnited Nations Plan of Action for African Economic\r\nRecovery and Development (UNPAAERD). Unfortunately\r\nthis programme failed to achieve the desired result. The\r\nGeneral Assembly then undertook a reassessment of\r\nUNPAAERD by adopting its New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s with measurable\r\nobjectives. In my delegation’s view, this new agenda will\r\nsuffer the same fate unless a firm determination is made by\r\nthe international community to deliver on its commitment.\r\nAfrica invests a lot of expectations in the implementation of\r\nthis agenda. We would like to call on the Secretary-General\r\nto ensure that the United Nations fulfills its part of the\r\nprocess. The United Nations has a responsibility to assist in\r\nputting in place feasible strategies that will enable Member\r\nStates to achieve economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Secretariat of the United Nations is an international\r\ncivil service, and like any bureaucracy there is a compelling\r\nneed for it to look critically at itself, justify its raison d’être\r\nand reassess how it proposes to meet the challenges of the\r\nfuture. It is in this connection that we welcome the bold\r\nsteps the Secretary-General has taken over the past\r\n12 months to restructure the Secretariat with a view to\r\nachieving efficiency, minimizing waste and promoting\r\naccountability. This is as it should be. However, in the\r\nprocess of carrying out this restructuring, care needs to be\r\ntaken to ensure that the principles of representativeness and\r\nof geographical distribution are maintained, particularly at\r\nthe management level of the Secretariat. Competence is not\r\nthe monopoly of any one region. The United Nations must\r\nindeed be a system that rewards achievement and punishes\r\ninadequate performance.\r\nAside from the restructuring of the General Assembly\r\nwhich has resulted in the reduction of the number of Main\r\nCommittees, and the ongoing efforts to streamline their\r\nworkload and working methods, my delegation believes that\r\nthe time is opportune to address the issue of the\r\ndemocratization of the Security Council. While my\r\nGovernment has already expressed its views on this subject\r\nin this body, and in response to the Secretary-General’s\r\nrequests to Member States, it wishes to state once again that\r\nthe Security Council can lay claim to legitimacy, moral\r\nauthority and representativeness only when it is fully\r\ndemocratized. We must put in place at the current session\r\nof the General Assembly a process that would ensure that\r\nthis objective is realized not later than the fiftieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. The reform process must not be\r\npiecemeal; it must be global to include all the regions.\r\nAnything short of this approach will be tantamount to a\r\ndenial of access. Such a development would be antithetical\r\nto the spirit of the Charter.\r\nThe United Nations is what we make of it. From an\r\nOrganization of which so much is expected, so much must\r\nbe given. Member States have a responsibility to make the\r\nOrganization viable. To this end we join with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in urging all Member States to endeavour to pay\r\ntheir assessed contributions so that the work of the\r\nOrganization is not unduly constrained.\r\nMr. LAMAMRA (Algeria) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Algeria fully endorses the support for this\r\nOrganization and for the efforts of the Secretary-General that\r\nwas expressed anew by the Permanent Representative of\r\nIndonesia on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. It also\r\nendorses the Movement’s observations, suggestions and\r\nproposals as part of a consistent effort to contribute to the\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations while remaining true to\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nThe international context is changing rapidly, and the\r\nOrganization’s missions are increasing in number, as are its\r\nsuccesses and difficulties, giving special importance to the\r\nconsideration this year of the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nthe work of the Organization.\r\nThe three words \"peace, development and democracy\"\r\nsum up very well the great challenges of the day, identified\r\nby the Secretary-General, who has stressed their\r\ninterrelationship. In this context, the Organization’s unique\r\nposition and vital role are rightly reaffirmed and\r\ndemonstrated.\r\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General for presenting\r\na comprehensive report that deals accurately with the\r\nOrganization’s activities in the many spheres with which it\r\ndeals. At the same time, the report contains analyses,\r\nproposals and projections that will stimulate thought, debate\r\nand dialogue.\r\nIt is undeniable that the past year has been marked by\r\na considerable extension of the Organization’s activities in\r\nthe area of the maintenance and restoration of peace. Its\r\nrole in the area of preventive diplomacy and post-conflict\r\npeace-building has also been strengthened.\r\nThe increase in the number of overtures to the United\r\nNations and in the Organization’s presence in the field has\r\ngone hand in hand with consideration by the General\r\nAssembly and by the Security Council of the relevant\r\naspects of the \"Agenda for Peace\" and with the initiation of\r\nmeasures, at the organizational and institutional levels, aimed\r\nat strengthening the Organization’s ability to envisage, plan\r\nand conduct peace-keeping operations. We consider it\r\nessential that this process be pursued and successfully\r\ncarried out, using all the lessons learned from experience in\r\nthe field and taking account of the guidelines and principles\r\ndefined in the two resolutions adopted by the General\r\nAssembly on the subject of the \"Agenda for Peace\".\r\nSimilarly, the progress that has undeniably been made\r\nin the area of disarmament, as a result of the ending of the\r\ncold war, should be consolidated and expanded in order to\r\nremove, once and for all, the spectra of nuclear war and\r\neliminate weapons of mass destruction.\r\nAt the same time - as is only right - completion of the\r\nprocess of decolonization continues to be one of the priority\r\ntasks of the Organization as it endeavours to fulfil its\r\nuniversal purpose.\r\nThe Algerian delegation shares the concern which is\r\nfrequently expressed by the Secretary-General, and which is\r\ndemonstrated clearly in his annual report, about the\r\nexacerbation of the Organization’s financial crisis by the\r\naccumulation of considerable arrears. In this regard,\r\nassurances that have been given over the past few weeks by\r\nseveral contributors and payments that have been received\r\nare encouraging developments. However, the fact remains\r\nthat the situation of the Organization will continue to be\r\nprecarious so long as its financial base is weakened as a\r\nresult of the irregular manner in which Member States\r\nhonour their obligations, or their delay in doing so.\r\nAnother striking feature of the past year is the efforts\r\nmade by the Secretary-General and by Member States to\r\nrationalize the structures of the Secretariat and of\r\nintergovernmental bodies. This process has involved the\r\nmobilization of a great deal of energy in the economic and\r\nsocial sectors. Of course, much remains to be done to\r\ndemocratize structures and their functioning and to improve\r\ncommunication and transparency. However, there is\r\nwidespread recognition of what is necessary, at least in so\r\nfar as the Security Council is concerned, and recognition of\r\nthe need for the General Assembly to play its full role as\r\ndefined in the Charter.\r\nIt seem to us that the time has come to liberate the\r\nOrganization’s potential for initiative in the area of\r\ndevelopment, to give new momentum and vigour to United\r\nNations action to establish more just and more equitable\r\ninternational relations. The close bond between peace and\r\ndevelopment cannot be overemphasized. This is the central\r\nissue in the agenda for development. In addition, the\r\nintegrated approach to human rights as one of the\r\nOrganization’s new priorities - this approach has been\r\nadvocated by the Secretary-General - should in our view be\r\na natural extension of the recognition by the Vienna\r\nConference on Human Rights of the right to development.\r\nIt is important that, henceforth, the efforts of everyone\r\nshould converge towards full realization of this fundamental\r\nright, for the benefit of the peoples of the third world.\r\nAt the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly,\r\nconsideration of the Secretary-General’s report on the work\r\nof the Organization was combined with a discussion of the\r\nreport \"An Agenda for Peace\". This resulted in wide\r\nparticipation and aroused great interest. This year’s debate\r\nconfirms the importance of a thorough and constructive\r\nstudy of the Secretary-General’s report. The next report of\r\nthe Secretary-General will coincide with the submission of\r\nthe agenda for development, which, we hope, will meet\r\nexpectations and rise to the challenge. We hope that this, in\r\nturn, will lead to the qualitative improvements that are\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 11\r\nessential for clear expression of the faith of the peoples of\r\nthe United Nations in the building of peace and in the\r\ncreation of conditions for the well-being of all.\r\nMr. ABDELLAH (Tunisia) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I should like, on behalf of my delegation, to\r\nextend warm congratulations to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on his innovative and substantive\r\nreport, which, we are sure, will constitute an excellent basis\r\nfor our continued efforts to strengthen the role of the\r\nOrganization and increase its efficiency.\r\nFollowing the statement of the representative of\r\nIndonesia, which occupies the presidency of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, we should like to express our\r\nwholehearted support for the position that he set out on our\r\nbehalf.\r\nWe welcome this opportunity to express our satisfaction\r\nthat the General Assembly is considering such an important\r\nreport as that of the Secretary-General, in accordance with\r\nthe spirit and letter of the Charter, which confers upon the\r\nGeneral Assembly the power to discuss the activities and\r\nfuture of the Organization.\r\nConsideration of this report will strengthen the role of\r\nthe General Assembly, especially in the current context, in\r\nwhich, in a spirit of dialogue and understanding, we are\r\nstriving to revitalize the Assembly’s work and strengthen its\r\nrole under the Charter.\r\nAs the Secretary-General stressed in his report, peace,\r\ndevelopment and democracy are interdependent goals that we\r\nall share, to which we are committed and which the\r\ninternational community is capable of achieving on the basis\r\nof the vast potential of the Organization, its wealth of\r\nexperience and its effective capacity to meet the many\r\ndifferent challenges to the international community and the\r\nwell-being of peoples.\r\nThe new dynamic approach outlined in \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\" describes innovative types of peace operations\r\nundertaken under the aegis of the Organization. We\r\nwelcome the fact that immediately after the last session the\r\nGeneral Assembly embarked upon an examination of the\r\nvarious suggestions and reached a consensus on them by\r\nadopting two resolutions. We would point out that the\r\nSecurity Council also got down to the task of examining\r\nvarious aspects of \"An Agenda for Peace\", particularly\r\nquestions of post-conflict economic recovery and\r\nreconstruction; the protection and security of personnel\r\nassigned to peace-keeping missions; recourse to Chapter VIII\r\nof the Charter, which gives a fundamental peace-keeping\r\nrole to regional arrangements, and the strengthening of\r\npreventive diplomacy.\r\nIn this regard we would stress once again the\r\nimportance, as a preventive measure, of the adoption of\r\neconomic and other measures which do not automatically\r\nentail the use of armed force for the purposes of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of Article 41 of the Charter. None the less, we\r\nremind the Assembly that, as the Assembly itself said in a\r\nresolution (47/120 B) on \"An Agenda for Peace\", we are\r\nconcerned that certain States are continuing to encounter\r\neconomic difficulties because of preventive or enforcement\r\nmeasures applied under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nThe natural corollary of \"An Agenda for Peace\" is an\r\nagenda for development. We await with great interest the\r\ndevelopment agenda foreshadowed by the Secretary-General\r\nin his report, being convinced, as he is, that human\r\ndevelopment in all its dimensions, and particularly the social,\r\neconomic and environmental, must be the focus of the\r\nconcerns of the Organization and its efforts to promote\r\ninternational cooperation and the establishment of a more\r\nunited, more just and more stable world.\r\nWe are convinced that the Organization must be more\r\neffective and play a central role in the establishment of an\r\ninternational order, legally binding, which is more\r\ndemocratic and equitable. The need for further\r\ndemocratization of the decision-making process in the\r\nvarious organs for more transparency in the functioning of\r\nthe Security Council is clear. We welcome the process of\r\nenlarging the basis of consultation and information in the\r\nCouncil. Any constructive new measure is appreciated. We\r\nconsider this process as a milestone on the way to\r\nconsideration of a greater participation of Member States in\r\nthe work of the Council, thus strengthening its credibility\r\nand authority.\r\nWith regard to peace-keeping operations we consider\r\nthat appropriate machinery for regular consultations should\r\nbe established so that countries which traditionally supply\r\ntroops, on the one hand, and the Secretary-General, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Military Staff Committee, on the\r\nother, could together examine the advisability of, and the\r\nmeans to be used for, launching a successful peace-keeping\r\noperation.\r\nSimilarly, we wish to stress the need to rationalize the\r\nwork of the General Assembly. In this regard we welcomed\r\nwith great interest the adoption of resolution 47/233, and we\r\nhope that the working group concerned will come up with\r\nuseful and relevant proposals on questions such as the\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nexamination by the Assembly of reports of the major organs\r\nestablished by the Charter.\r\nFinally, we wish to stress that a revitalized\r\nOrganization, including its Secretariat, would better\r\nguarantee the execution of its mandates in accordance with\r\nthe priorities assigned to it.\r\nThose are my delegation’s preliminary views on the\r\nimportant report on the work of the Organization. Of\r\ncourse, our interest in various aspects mentioned in the\r\ndocument will be no less keen when the various Committees\r\nof the Assembly take up the relevant parts.\r\nMr. CARDENAS (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): As the Assembly considers agenda item 10,\r\n\"Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization\" (A/48/1), I shall refer both to that recent\r\nreport and to the report of the Secretary-General, \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\" (A/47/277).\r\nIt is a little more than a year since the publication of\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General requested at the Summit\r\nmeeting of the Security Council on 31 January 1992. That\r\nreport, \"An Agenda for Peace\", stimulated a thorough\r\nconsideration in the General Assembly and other organs of\r\nthe Organization of its important contents and various\r\nproposals.\r\nThe informal working group established by the\r\nPresident of the forty-seventh session carried out intense and\r\ndifficult work, which led to the adoption of two resolutions\r\n47/120 A and 47/120 B, whose texts owe much to the firm,\r\nexpert leadership of the representative of Egypt, Ambassador\r\nElaraby, and to the dedication of all those who shared in his\r\nefforts.\r\nThe Security Council also established a working group\r\nwhich met from time to time. The result of its deliberations\r\nis reflected in six statements by the Council’s President.\r\nSubsidiary bodies of the Assembly also have some of the\r\nwise proposals in the report under consideration.\r\nThe Argentine Republic has already expressed its\r\nposition on the document (A/47/232) presented by the Rio\r\nGroup on 28 May 1992, \"Guidelines for strengthening the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations in the area of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping\". That\r\ndocument is still valid.\r\nIt would take a long time to carry out a detailed\r\nanalysis of all the elements in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. I shall therefore confine myself now to drawing\r\nattention to three of its ideas.\r\nFirst, preventive diplomacy and preventive deployment\r\nare perhaps, for my delegation, two of the most interesting\r\nand important concepts in the report. The subject was\r\nconsidered in the Assembly’s unofficial working group, and\r\nits preliminary conclusions are reflected in the resolutions.\r\nThe Argentine Republic reiterates its determination to\r\nwork with the United Nations in peace-keeping operations,\r\nin keeping with its tradition, and also expressly supports the\r\nconcept of preventive deployment in peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nThe case of Macedonia, in our opinion, is a perfect\r\nexample of the effectiveness which can, in theory, be\r\nexpected from this type of operation. We believe that this\r\nitem must continue to be considered both by the General\r\nAssembly and by the Secretariat, within the framework of\r\npeace-keeping operations. We believe that we must begin\r\nby implementing, after due adoption, principles and norms\r\nsimilar to those used in other peace-keeping operations.\r\nSecondly, post-conflict peace-building was another of\r\nthe important subjects considered in \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nThe international community, over the past few years, has\r\nwitnessed a large number of armed conflicts, some of which\r\nhave been resolved within the framework of United Nations\r\nforces. This emphasizes the fact that there is a close\r\nrelationship between economic development and political\r\nstability. We also believe that this concept requires thorough\r\nstudy and should be dealt with by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis much-anticipated report, \"An Agenda for Development\".\r\nThirdly, with respect to the safety of United Nations\r\npersonnel, Argentina participates, with a significant\r\ncontingent of troops, in peace-keeping operations. We are\r\ntherefore very much aware of the importance and urgency of\r\nthe subject of the safety of personnel functioning in peace-\r\nkeeping operations. The fatalities this year and the dramatic\r\nsuccesses of Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina bear\r\ndramatic witness to the great seriousness of the problem.\r\nThe Secretary-General has clearly drawn attention to\r\nthis subject in his report. Today, the General Assembly is\r\ngiving special consideration to this as well. We are pleased\r\nthat the item has been included on the agenda of the forty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly and that the Sixth\r\nCommittee will soon begin consideration of a draft\r\nconvention on this subject. In this connection, we would\r\nlike to give special thanks to the delegations of New Zealand\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 13\r\nand Ukraine for the energy and hard work they put into\r\npromoting this item.\r\nJust a few days ago, we took cognizance of the report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/48/1). This is a comprehensive document which clearly\r\nillustrates the special period that our Organization is going\r\nthrough, as is the entire international system. We appreciate\r\nthe methodological approach taken in this report. We too\r\nbelieve that the objectives of peace, development and\r\ndemocracy are inextricably linked, and a global reality.\r\nMore specifically regarding our Organization, we\r\ncannot today be indifferent to the crisis around us. This\r\ncrisis, in our opinion, could, in spite of its complexity, be\r\nviewed as growing pains, and this is evident in two\r\nparticular areas that are closely interrelated: the financial\r\ndifficulties of the Organization and the vertiginous increase\r\nin the number and functions of peace-keeping operations.\r\nToday, we must not only continue to give thought to\r\nthese matters, but we must seek concrete solutions to\r\nexisting problems so as to perfect the machinery for creating,\r\nexecuting and concluding these operations, which we will\r\ncontinue to support. If we fail to do so, this crisis, if\r\nallowed to continue, will doubtless undermine the credibility\r\nof the Organization, precisely at a time when it is finally\r\nbeing called upon to play the role for which it was originally\r\ncreated.\r\nMr. BELYEV (Belarus) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe delegation of Belarus would like to express to the\r\nSecretary-General its gratitude for his report on the work of\r\nthe Organization (A/48/1). Not only does it give an\r\nappraisal of the current state of the world and information on\r\nthe wide-ranging activities of the United Nations and its\r\nmajor organs, but it also proposes measures for adapting the\r\nOrganization to new realities as well as recommendations\r\ndesigned to solve the most important problems.\r\nThis report of the Secretary-General is not only the\r\nlongest over the past few years but it is one which contains\r\nmany new ideas and recommendations as well as a wealth\r\nof material on the multifaceted work of the Organization.\r\nOne cannot but agree with the Secretary-General when he\r\nsays that \"working for peace provides us with no place of\r\nrest\" (A/48/1, para. 5) and that without peace there can be\r\nno development and there can be no democracy (A/48/1,\r\npara. 11). We are therefore satisfied at the fact that the\r\nreport pays so much attention to questions of preventive\r\ndiplomacy and the settlement of conflicts.\r\nConcrete steps have been taken to realize the ideas and\r\nproposals contained in the report of the Secretary-General\r\nentitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). There has been\r\na strengthening of the potential of the Secretariat for fact-\r\nfinding and analysis with a view to meeting the early-\r\nwarning requirements of the United Nations. Discussion of\r\nthe recommendations of the informal open-ended working\r\ngroup established by the General Assembly has yielded\r\nconcrete results, and the Security Council has also come\r\nforward with concrete proposals. These important matters\r\nare being discussed in other organs of the United Nations as\r\nwell. There has been further development of new forms of\r\npreventive diplomacy, fact-finding missions, good-offices\r\nmissions and goodwill missions, and the dispatch of special\r\nenvoys to areas of tension.\r\nMost praiseworthy are the tremendous efforts\r\nu n d e r t a k e n b y t h e S e c r e t a r y - G e n e r a l ,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He has devoted a great deal of\r\nattention to peacemaking, peace-keeping, and peace-building\r\nin post-conflict periods. The question has already been\r\nraised here about peace-keeping operations and the problems\r\nthat arise in this connection for the United Nations and its\r\nMember States. In our view, the most vigorous measures\r\nare needed to enhance the effectiveness of peace-keeping\r\noperations. At the same time, in their planning and\r\nexecution the current possibilities and resources of the\r\nUnited Nations must be taken into account.\r\nThe Belarus delegation wholeheartedly shares the view\r\nof the Secretary-General that in the international context,\r\nfrom the standpoint of security, some important events have\r\noccurred that have required new methods of settlement and\r\nnew efforts on the part of the international community. It is\r\nprecisely in this spirit that we should approach the talks on\r\nthe drafting of a comprehensive nuclear-test ban treaty and\r\nan extension of the non-proliferation Treaty for an indefinite\r\nperiod. Our Republic has made its own concrete\r\ncontribution to disarmament, and the Secretary-General\r\nstresses in his report:\r\n\"I am gratified that Belarus has recently ratified the\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty ...\". (A/48/1, para. 474)\r\nand I personally would add \"and the strategic arms reduction\r\nTreaty\".\r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Belarus agrees with\r\nthe view of the Secretary-General that more attention should\r\nbe devoted to the Economic and Social Council, which has\r\nthe role of improving economic and social cooperation as an\r\nindependent objective enshrined in the United Nations\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nCharter and also as a prerequisite for enduring global peace\r\nand security.\r\nAt the high-level segment of the substantive session of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council in 1992 in New York, our\r\ndelegation supported the proposal by the Secretary-General\r\nthat the Economic and Social Council should submit to the\r\nSecurity Council reports on situations that, in its view,\r\ninvolved a threat to international peace and security.\r\nUnfortunately, due attention has not so far been paid to these\r\nproposals.\r\nOur delegation notes with satisfaction the active work\r\nof the Organization on implementing the decisions of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, held from 3 to 14 June 1992 in Rio\r\nde Janeiro.\r\nThe Belarus delegation has studied with particular\r\nattention part B of Chapter II of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on the work of the Organization. Our Republic is one\r\nof the countries where interim offices of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) have been opened. We\r\nhave repeatedly stated our support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts to render assistance to countries going\r\nthrough a transitional period and to organize comprehensive\r\nprovision by the Organization of services in various areas.\r\nThe temporary UNDP office in Belarus is performing\r\nsome important practical tasks, meeting developmental needs\r\nand also supporting the process of our society’s transition to\r\nnew forms of organization. It has become an important link\r\nin the chain of coordination of the operational activities of\r\nthe various specialized agencies and programmes within the\r\nUnited Nations system in our country.\r\nOur delegation shares the Secretary-General’s profound\r\nconcern about the unsatisfactory financial situation of our\r\nOrganization. Given the gravity of this situation, and despite\r\nour extremely difficult economic and financial situation, the\r\nGovernment of Belarus has made a contribution in the\r\namount of $3.5 million to the Organization’s budget. At the\r\nsame time, we expect the Organization, in the form of its\r\nmajor organ, the General Assembly, to take measures\r\nensuring that Belarus’s financial obligation to the\r\nOrganization is in strict concordance with its real capacity to\r\npay.\r\nAn important event in the life of the United Nations\r\nwas the World Conference on Human Rights, which made\r\nit possible to analyse and take stock of all previous United\r\nNations work in defending and promoting human rights.\r\nThe Conference also indicated major areas of activity for the\r\nfuture and identified obstacles that hinder further progress in\r\nthis area. We fully share the Secretary-General’s conclusion\r\nthat it was a turning-point in the Organization’s work to\r\npromote and defend human rights.\r\nOur delegation took an active part in the preparations\r\nfor the Vienna Conference and in the Conference itself. We\r\nnote with satisfaction that, despite initial disagreements,\r\nparticipants in the Conference were able to find a way of\r\ncoming to agreement, and thus confirmed the universality of\r\nfundamental human rights and principles and reaffirmed the\r\nstatus of the human person as the primary subject of human\r\nrights. Of decisive importance for ensuring fuller respect for\r\nhuman rights is the coordination and cooperation of all\r\norgans of the United Nations and the specialized agencies,\r\nregional intergovernmental organizations and national\r\ninstitutions working in the field.\r\nThe institutional reform being undertaken in the United\r\nNations, the creation of new machinery for coordinating\r\nhumanitarian activities and a step-by-step approach to the\r\nconcept of transition from emergency assistance to\r\nrehabilitation and development are all important steps\r\ntowards the management of emergency humanitarian\r\nsituations. Unfortunately, quite a number of these situations\r\nhave occurred in the Eastern European region. In this\r\nregard, the Republic of Belarus supports the expansion of\r\ninternational preventive measures, which involve the United\r\nNations in difficult humanitarian situations, particularly in\r\nhot spots, on the basis of the full consent of the parties\r\nconcerned.\r\nHowever, I would like to stress our profound concern\r\nat the fact that the United Nations has found itself more and\r\nmore frequently involved on a larger and larger scale, and\r\nhaving to react not only to the humanitarian consequences of\r\nnatural catastrophes or technological disasters but also to the\r\nconsequences of ethnic conflicts and political instability.\r\nTherefore, the highest priority of our Organization should, in\r\nour view, be the prevention of a deterioration of the\r\nhumanitarian crises in any part of the world today.\r\nIn this context, I would also like to touch on the\r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe which occurred\r\nmore than seven years ago. Our delegation shares the deep\r\nfeelings of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who\r\nwas recently able to visit one of the countries hardest hit by\r\nthe Chernobyl disaster and see for himself that the\r\nconsequences of this tragedy are still affecting the everyday\r\nlife of millions of people. The Republic of Belarus will\r\ndevelop a new approach on the part of the United Nations\r\nsystem to activities in stricken regions, worked out in\r\nconjunction with the new United Nations Special\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 15\r\nCoordinator on Chernobyl, Mr. Jan Eliasson. The approach\r\nreceived widespread support at the coordinating meeting in\r\nMinsk this May, and also at the summer meeting of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nI would like to stress that broad international support in\r\ndealing with the wide range of problems inherited from\r\nChernobyl, particularly humanitarian problems, could be one\r\nof the most crucial guarantees of the strengthening of\r\ndemocracy and economic and other reforms in our country -\r\nnot to mention the importance of the lessons of Chernobyl\r\nfor the whole of the international community.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express our gratitude for\r\nthis opportunity to make some comments in connection with\r\nthe discussion of the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nwork of the Organization.\r\nMr. KHARRAZI (Islamic Republic of Iran): My\r\ndelegation wishes to express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization and his staff for the\r\nreport on the work of the Organization. It is not my\r\ndelegation’s intention to touch upon all matters contained in\r\nthe present report, which includes issues ranging from peace-\r\nkeeping in different parts of the world to financial problems\r\nof the Organization. My delegation will, in due course,\r\nexpound on different issues contained in the report during\r\nthe current deliberations of the General Assembly in the\r\nplenary as well as in the Main Committees. Rather, I will\r\nconfine myself to addressing certain areas of the report in\r\ngeneral terms which might shed light on the proper\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations in the future.\r\nLet me first emphasize that my delegation is convinced\r\nthat the United Nations, as the world Organization, can\r\nprovide the framework for effective cooperation and\r\ndialogue among Member States based on the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter. The United Nations has a crucial\r\nrole to play in maintaining international peace and security\r\nand fostering a just and equitable system of international\r\nrelations. In this regard, the Foreign Minister of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, addressing the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, emphasized that:\r\n\"A balanced, objective and far-sighted approach to\r\nvarious international political, economic and cultural\r\ncrises and challenges, based on justice and on the\r\ncommon principles and objectives enshrined in the\r\nCharter, is the most fundamental requirement for the\r\nrestoration and enhancement of the credibility of the\r\nOrganization, and can also play a significant role in\r\nsecuring long-term stability and trust.\" (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Forty-eighth session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 14th meeting, p. [71]).\r\nDuring the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly, the report of the Secretary-General entitled \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\" was thoroughly discussed and the\r\nmembers of the Non-Aligned Movement contributed\r\npositively during the negotiations and discussions on the\r\nreport which led to the adoption of resolutions 47/120 and\r\n47/120 B. My delegation maintains that the principles of\r\nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States must be\r\nrespected in the process of implementing the\r\nrecommendations contained in the resolutions and in the\r\nnegotiations that may be conducted in the future on the\r\noutstanding issues.\r\nIt is unfortunate to note that certain countries have\r\ninterpreted some aspects of \"An Agenda for Peace\" as\r\nincreasing the prerogatives of the Security Council at the\r\nexpense of the General Assembly. We believe that such\r\nconnotations should be rejected and that the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the supreme organ of the United\r\nNations should be upheld. Article 24 of the Charter clearly\r\nstates that the Security Council acts on behalf of the\r\nMembers of the United Nations. Therefore, the Security\r\nCouncil should be accountable to the General Assembly,\r\nwhich is composed of the entire membership. The General\r\nAssembly must exercise its powers and functions relevant to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security in\r\naccordance with the Charter. Noting the Secretary-General’s\r\nview that the agenda of the General Assembly is in need of\r\nsome rationalization, my delegation believes that the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly,\r\nincluding the rationalization of the agenda, should be\r\nconducted through an informal open-ended working group,\r\nas reflected in resolution 47/233. We are prepared to work\r\nin this working group towards that end.\r\nIn the wake of the cold war, the Security Council has\r\nexpanded its activities. As reflected in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, during the period from 1 January\r\n1992 to 31 August 1993, the Council held numerous\r\nmeetings and adopted numerous resolutions and statements.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the fact that the Security Council\r\nhas been meeting almost continuously and that it has studied\r\na variety of security threats around the world. Now the\r\nquestion is whether the Security Council - especially its\r\npermanent members - has acted resolutely and expeditiously\r\nto uphold justice and the principles of the Charter to reverse\r\naggression. Has the Council shown the necessary political\r\nwill to stop applying double standards?\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nUnfortunately, the Security Council has been unable to\r\nshoulder its responsibilities in dealing with some clear cases\r\nof aggression, the most recent of which is the Serbian\r\naggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\na Member of the United Nations. The Security Council\r\nshould ensure that its role conforms to its mandate as\r\ndefined in the Charter. Furthermore, the Council should\r\nrespect the principle of transparency in its work and avoid\r\nundemocratic practices and hidden agendas. In this regard,\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran concurs with the\r\nSecretary-General’s view that:\r\n\"Informal consultations should be punctuated by more\r\nformal meetings in order both to inform, and to seek\r\nsupport from, the wider circle of Member States.\"\r\n(A/48/1, para. 38)\r\nThe current international climate is conducive to\r\nworking urgently on the issue of reactivating the\r\nNorth-South dialogue to strengthen international economic\r\ncooperation for development. During the recent Ministerial\r\nMeeting of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in New York\r\non 4 October 1993, the Ministers noted that the persistent\r\nrecession in the developing countries and continuing\r\neconomic stagnation in many of them were stifling their\r\ndevelopment efforts. In our opinion, the United Nations has\r\na central role in promoting international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment and in bringing development issues to the\r\nattention of the international community. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation appreciates the work of the Secretary-General in\r\nthe preparation of a report on an agenda for development, as\r\nrequested in General Assembly resolution 47/181, and looks\r\nforward to receiving the preliminary report of the\r\nSecretary-General, to be submitted to the current session of\r\nthe General Assembly, as noted in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on the work of the Organization.\r\nTo conclude, I wish to refer to the measures taken by\r\nthe Secretariat to enhance productivity in conference\r\nservices, as reflected in the Secretary-General’s report. My\r\ndelegation is of the view that the introduction of these\r\nmeasures has caused difficulties for the proper functioning\r\nof the work of delegations. Cognizant of the difficult\r\nfinancial situation of the United Nations, my delegation\r\nwishes to emphasize the importance of providing full\r\nservices to Member States in terms of both conference\r\nservices and distribution of documents.\r\nMr. MARKER (Pakistan): My delegation would like\r\nto express its profound appreciation to the Secretary General\r\nfor his report on the work of the Organization contained in\r\ndocument A/48/1.\r\nThe Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, the\r\nAmbassador of Indonesia, and the Chairman of the Group of\r\n77, the Ambassador of Colombia, have already expressed\r\nviews which largely reflect the substance of my delegation’s\r\nideas. The report reflects a deep comprehension of the\r\nstrong currents of history flowing in these troubled yet\r\ninteresting times. The report manifests the\r\nSecretary-General’s vast academic qualifications, his\r\nrenowned diplomatic experience and skills, and his political\r\ncourage in standing up in defence of justice, equity and\r\npeace. The report brings out the many achievements of the\r\nOrganization as well as the challenges which require urgent\r\nand prompt response. My delegation is particularly\r\nimpressed by the comprehensive manner in which the report\r\nestablished linkages underlying the need to take a composite\r\napproach for the realization of lasting peace around the\r\nworld.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has said, the United Nations\r\nhas a second chance today to live up to the role envisaged\r\nfor it under its Charter. The euphoria of yesterday is being\r\ntempered by the sobering realities of today. But we must\r\nnot allow temporary difficulties in implementing the will of\r\nthe world community to cloud the vision and promise of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe Pakistan delegation is particularly gratified that the\r\nSecretary-General has drawn the attention of the world\r\ncommunity to the problem of Jammu and Kashmir in\r\nparagraph 352 of the report. The suppression of the right of\r\nself-determination in Kashmir has led to massive violations\r\nof human rights. It also threatens international peace and\r\nsecurity, and my delegation deems it entirely appropriate that\r\nthe issue remains under consideration by the United Nations.\r\nIn this connection, it may be stated that the United Nations\r\nMilitary Observer Group for India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP)\r\nhas an essential role to play in ameliorating this grave\r\nsituation and reducing tension and conflict. UNMOGIP\r\nshould be enabled fully to carry out its mandate to patrol the\r\nline of control on both sides.\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has offered\r\nhis good offices to India and Pakistan to help in resolving\r\nthe Kashmir question. Pakistan welcomes this initiative and\r\nhas conveyed its acceptance of the Secretary-General’s offer\r\nof good offices.\r\nMr. ROWE (Australia): We welcome the very\r\ncomprehensive and focused report (A/48/1) which the\r\nSecretary-General has presented on the work of the United\r\nNations over the past 12 months.\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 17\r\nThe report demonstrates unequivocally that with the\r\nchanges which have occurred in the world in recent years,\r\nthe United Nations now has a pivotal and more challenging\r\nrole to perform than at any other time in its history in\r\nestablishing world order and in seizing the opportunity to\r\nmake progress across the range of activities within its\r\nmandate as set out in the Charter.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s view that the pattern\r\nof the past 12 months displays three realities: the\r\ncomprehensive nature of the global challenge; the\r\nindispensability of the United Nations, and the gap that has\r\nbeen revealed by the fact that the demands of Member States\r\non the Organization are not matched by the resources\r\nprovided.\r\nThe challenges presented by these realities are\r\nconsiderable, not least because of the essentiality of working\r\nto achieve a unified and integrated approach to peace,\r\ndevelopment and democracy.\r\nThese changes and these challenges require responses\r\nof substance. But in addition to dealing with each\r\nsubstantive issue - whether in the field of peace, arms\r\ncontrol, economic development, human rights or the\r\nresponse to non-military threats to security - we are\r\ncompelled to add to the list of those tasks the need to reform\r\nourselves, to renew our institutions.\r\nThe report indicates the Secretary-General’s readiness\r\nto implement change and records practical steps which have\r\nbeen taken so far, in several areas. We welcome this\r\napproach.\r\nHowever, if the United Nations is to play, with\r\nmaximum effectiveness, the central role which is now\r\ndemanded of it, then further change - further reform - in the\r\nsystem really is necessary. Unless the Organization develops\r\na comprehensive capacity to address today’s and tomorrow’s\r\nproblems, there is a real risk of its gradually losing, with\r\nGovernments and peoples around the world, the credibility\r\nit needs to survive.\r\nThis is particularly so in relation to the role of the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community generally in\r\nsecuring peace in the world of the l990s and beyond. This\r\nparticular role is vital because, as the Secretary-General\r\nnotes, without peace there can be no development and there\r\ncan be no democracy.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s invaluable document \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\" (A/47/277) stimulated a major\r\ninternational debate on this particular role for the\r\nOrganization. There have been very practical consequences\r\nsince then in implementing the recommendations in the\r\nAgenda, as mentioned in the report on the work of the\r\nOrganization. But more remains to be done.\r\nIn his address to the General Assembly at its\r\n5th plenary meeting, two weeks ago, the Australian Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, presented a study\r\nentitled Cooperating for Peace, which represented an\r\nAustralian contribution to the ongoing debate begun by \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\". In Cooperating for Peace\r\nSenator Evans identified seven priority areas for change, to\r\ngive the United Nations that comprehensive capacity to meet\r\nthe challenges of our times.\r\nThe first is to restructure the Secretariat to ensure that\r\nthe Secretary-General has an effective chain of command\r\nexercising authority over major United Nations operations,\r\nand to consolidate and coordinate in a more orderly and\r\nmanageable way the present range of departments and\r\nagencies. We support the proposal that the\r\nSecretary-General create a new senior structure at United\r\nNations Headquarters, under which he would have four\r\nDeputy Secretaries-General responsible respectively for\r\nPeace and Security, Economic and Social Affairs,\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, and Administration and Management.\r\nEach such Deputy would have full executive responsibility\r\nfor the operational issues falling within his or her portfolio,\r\nsubject only to direction by the Secretary-General. This\r\nwould be a big change, and it is not the first time it has been\r\nproposed, but it is the change that, more than anything else\r\nin our view, would create the conditions for more orderly\r\nand effective management throughout the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nThe second priority need is to resolve conclusively the\r\ncritical funding problem of the United Nations.\r\nOverwhelmingly, the problem is one that has been created\r\nby Member States and is entirely within our ability to\r\nresolve by meeting our assessed contributions for regular\r\nbudgets and peace operations in full and on time. If the\r\nbulk of current arrears were to be paid by the end of this\r\nyear, the United Nations finances would be in a quite\r\nhealthy position, with the Working Capital Fund, the Peace-\r\nkeeping Reserve Fund and the Special Account all\r\nreplenished, and the Organization in a position to meet all\r\noutstanding troop-contribution costs.\r\nThe third priority is to improve the management of\r\npeace operations, both at Headquarters and in the field.\r\nSome very significant and useful steps have been taken in\r\nthis regard and are mentioned in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport, such as more clearly defining the respective roles of\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe Department of Peace-keeping Operations and the\r\nDepartment of Political Affairs and incorporating the Field\r\nOperations Division into the Department of Peace-keeping\r\nOperations. But more remains to be done, including in\r\nparticular the development over time of a properly\r\nconstituted general staff to plan and manage the military\r\ndimensions of such operations.\r\nThe fourth priority is to give special attention to the\r\nmachinery of preventive diplomacy, again both at\r\nHeadquarters and in the field. These efforts have been\r\nlargely ad hoc in the past, although the Department of\r\nPolitical Affairs is gradually building a core of appropriate\r\nexpertise. Quite apart from anything else, there is an\r\noverwhelming cost advantage in doing more to stop disputes\r\nbecoming armed conflicts. We welcome both the\r\nrecognition in the report that preventive diplomacy is now\r\nbecoming understood as a vital field for practical action and\r\nthe Secretary-General’s own involvement in preventive\r\ndiplomacy. We consider that the most promising approach\r\nto upgrading United Nations preventive diplomacy would be\r\none which gave the Organization the capacity to offer a\r\ndispute resolution service to its Members, providing skilled\r\nthird-party assistance through good offices and mediation.\r\nWe suggest in this respect the creation of a number of\r\nregionally located peace and security resource centres to help\r\ncarry out both preventive diplomacy and peacemaking\r\nfunctions closer to the area where problems arise. We also\r\nsuggest there be a substantial upgrading of the information\r\nand analytical capability available to the Department of\r\nPolitical Affairs for these and related purposes.\r\nThe fifth priority is to rethink the system of\r\nhumanitarian relief coordination. Despite advances that have\r\nbeen made with the creation of the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, we think some basic structural\r\nproblems remain. We propose that they be addressed in a\r\nrather radical way by the creation of a new disaster response\r\nagency - combining the relief and basic rehabilitation\r\nfunctions of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund and the World Food Programme - which would work\r\ndirectly with the suggested Deputy Secretary-General for\r\nHumanitarian Affairs.\r\nThe sixth priority, as we see it, is to take various steps\r\nto raise the profile within the United Nations system of\r\npeace-building. This is the point of intersection between the\r\npeace and security role of the United Nations and its\r\neconomic and social role, and it should be given recognition\r\nand emphasis as such. The pursuit of peace and security has\r\nto include the satisfaction of basic human needs as well as\r\nthe direct prevention, containment and settlement of armed\r\nconflict. Much of the United Nations system is, in fact,\r\nconcerned with peace-building in the form of activities such\r\nas the making of international law, disarmament, economic\r\nand social advancement, sustainable development,\r\ndemocratization and institution-building. But much more\r\ncan be done, organizationally, to link these activities\r\ntogether, recognize their security significance and ensure that\r\nthey are pursued with a sense of common purpose.\r\nThe remaining priority, a very large subject in itself, is\r\nto regenerate the Security Council - not because it is now\r\nworking ineffectively, but because its manifest lack of\r\nrepresentativeness is beginning to have an impact on its\r\nlegitimacy. The Security Council is the linchpin of the\r\nwhole United Nations peace and security system, and it is in\r\nno one’s interest that its credibility should be allowed to\r\nerode gradually. The outstanding questions about the size\r\nand shape of the Council should certainly be resolved by the\r\ntime of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, in\r\n1995. Indeed, this remains an ideal target date for the\r\nachievement of a whole range of necessary organizational\r\nreforms.\r\nOur survival in the 1990s and beyond will depend on\r\nour developing a new understanding of what constitutes\r\nsecurity and what contributes to it. It will depend on our\r\ncapacity to think clearly about how to react to new security\r\nproblems as they arise. It will depend on us all developing\r\nand sustaining habits of dialogue and a real commitment to\r\ncooperating for peace. And it is through peace that we shall\r\nbe able to make headway with regard to the urgent need for\r\ndevelopment in all its many dimensions.\r\nThe attainment of peace, development and democracy\r\nwill also, though, depend on our willingness to rethink and\r\nreshape our institutions, particularly the United Nations, so\r\nthat they can cope with the new realities. The Australian\r\nproposals are offered in this constructive spirit.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report clearly reflects his\r\ncommitment to meeting the challenges posed by these new\r\nrealities. He acknowledges in his introduction that the\r\nrenaissance of the United Nations remains in question and\r\nthat the international community stands at a turning-point.\r\nThus, his report is a stimulus to greater realism, engagement,\r\neffort and political creativity. We should all work with the\r\nSecretary-General to achieve the realization of that objective,\r\nwhich we all share, of a more stable world order through a\r\nstronger and more effective United Nations.\r\nMr. YASSIN (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic): In\r\ndiscussing the Secretary-General’s report (A/48/1) dated\r\n10 September 1993, which covers the period between the\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 19\r\nforty-seventh and the forty-eighth sessions of the General\r\nAssembly, we must commend the report. Unlike the reports\r\nof previous years, it is quite long - the longest and most\r\ndetailed document on the work of the Organization over\r\n12 months. It covers many vital points of interest to the\r\ninternational community in the areas of development and the\r\nachievement of international peace and security.\r\nIt is not our intention to deal with this significant\r\ndocument analytically. My delegation may find an\r\nopportunity to deal with some of its aspects at length in the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s competent Committees. However, it\r\nmay be appropriate here to deal briefly with some of the\r\naspects covered by the report together with those aspects\r\nwhich relate directly to Sudan.\r\nWe associate ourselves with the Secretary-General’s\r\nidea expressed in part III of the report, \"Developing the\r\nglobal community\", that we must stop and reflect on this\r\nimportant issue that is so vital to all human societies. It has\r\nto do with global development activities, operational\r\nactivities for development, regional development activities\r\nand human rights.\r\nWe agree with the premise that human development in\r\nits social and economic dimensions is the essential\r\nfoundation of all global development efforts. We look\r\nforward to the Secretary-General’s initiative on an agenda\r\nfor development, and hope that it will set the guidelines for\r\nthe Organization’s work in the future in both the economic\r\nand the social fields.\r\nOne of the reasons which led to the emergence of\r\nsocial and economic hotbeds of tension in the developing\r\nworld has been the neglect of development in those two\r\nmajor areas. While most of the countries of the developing\r\nworld have liberated themselves from colonialist domination,\r\nthey are still in thrall to unfair economic and commercial\r\nand monetary systems. They have been calling, through\r\ntheir regional institutions, for activating the North/South\r\ndialogue and for alleviating the debt burden that has broken\r\ntheir backs and deprived them of the ability to achieve\r\neconomic growth and prosperity. The developed countries\r\nhave to abandon their conditions within the framework of\r\nbilateral economic and monetary cooperation and to embark\r\nupon collective multilateral negotiations. We seek a suitable\r\nmechanism that would make it possible to achieve this end.\r\nHaving said this, we must state that there can be no\r\ndevelopment for the countries of the developing world unless\r\nthey are enabled to acquire modern technology and to\r\nacquaint themselves with the scientific methods of\r\ndevelopment. This is a matter we hope the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s development programme will touch upon.\r\nAs regards Agenda 21, Sudan, in its regional context,\r\nhas cooperated fully and has provided all the environmental\r\nstudies that could contribute to this great humanitarian effort\r\naimed at sparing the world grave environmental disasters.\r\nDespite the close cooperation between Sudan and the United\r\nNations Environment Programme, we are still eager to have\r\nfurther cooperation in the field of environmental law and in\r\ncompleting the establishment of our environmental\r\ninstitutions so that we may be able to implement the\r\nrecommendations of the Earth Summit in Rio, especially in\r\nthe field of combating drought and decertification.\r\nIt may be fitting here to refer to the pioneering role that\r\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and\r\nDevelopment (IGADD) could play in the field of combating\r\ndecertification, drought and the monitoring of environmental\r\ndisasters if it is provided with the adequate funding and\r\ntechnical support it requires for the important projects it has\r\nsubmitted and continues to submit to the donor country in\r\norder for them to consider the possibility of providing the\r\nnecessary funding. The Authority can play a significant role\r\nthat would complement the efforts of the competent United\r\nNations agencies in preventing the catastrophes that may\r\noverwhelm the Horn of Africa and Eastern Africa. From\r\nthis rostrum, we call for all possible support to that\r\nAuthority and invite all United Nations agencies to extend to\r\nit the close cooperation it needs. We look forward to\r\nparticipating effectively in the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, scheduled for 1995 in Copenhagen, as it is\r\nintended to deal with issues that have a direct bearing on the\r\ndeveloping world. In the same spirit, we look forward to\r\nparticipating in the Fourth World Conference on Women,\r\nscheduled for 1995 in Beijing, as we expect the Conference\r\nto focus on the importance of the pioneering role of women\r\nin developing human societies and because we are convinced\r\nthat the achievements of women since the Third World\r\nConference on Women, held in Nairobi in 1985, will\r\nencourage us to deploy efforts towards the advancement of\r\nwomen.\r\nAs regards the activities of the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) mentioned in the report, it\r\nbehoves us here to commend the close cooperation by this\r\nprogramme with the Government of Sudan in many areas,\r\nincluding those of expanded immunization, oral rehydration\r\ntherapy, provision of fresh water and health services for\r\nmothers and children, a matter which has led to a fall in\r\ninfant and mother mortality rates. UNICEF also works in\r\nconcert with the Government of Sudan in combating the\r\nguinea-worm disease and in dealing with the imbalances that\r\nresult from iodine deficiency.\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nGiven the importance my country attaches to mothers’\r\nand children’s health, a high council for child health care\r\nunder the personal supervision of the Head of the State has\r\nbeen established. Also, a giant Ministry of Social Planning\r\nhas been established with a view to promoting the welfare\r\nof Sudanese citizens in every respect.\r\nAs for the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) we commend Mr. Speth, the Administrator of the\r\nprogramme which is of great importance to us in the\r\ndeveloping countries. However, alleviating the intensity of\r\npoverty, the management of development, the environment\r\nand natural resources, enhancing the role of women in\r\ndevelopment, ensuring technical cooperation and harnessing\r\nscience and technology in the service of development are\r\nobjectives which cannot be achieved except by increasing the\r\nProgramme’s technical and financial capabilities. We look\r\nforward to further efforts by this important Programme and\r\ncloser cooperation with other United Nations specialized\r\nagencies as well as with international and regional financial\r\ninstitutions.\r\nOnce peace is established in Sudan, we look forward to\r\nincreased cooperation with the Programme in the repatriation\r\nof displaced persons and refugees and the rebuilding of all\r\nthat has been devastated by war. We wish to restore the\r\nsocial fabric in the South and to enable the citizens there to\r\nreturn to normal life and to obtain their basic needs.\r\nWe wish to express our full appreciation for the\r\nremarks in the report of the Secretary-General concerning\r\nthe United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA)\r\nbecause of its assistance in implementing our plan aimed at\r\nlinking the priorities of our national development policies to\r\npopulation activities. We have received appropriate\r\nassistance in formulating the plans of the last census in the\r\ncountry.\r\nWithin the framework of our cooperation with the\r\nWorld Food Programme (WFP) as contained in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, Sudan offered 153,000 tonnes of grain\r\nto the World Food Programme to be distributed to all the\r\nneedy in the country, especially in the southern part. Ninety\r\nthousand tonnes have been distributed but we have not been\r\nable to deliver the remainder. We hope that countries and\r\ninstitutions in a position to do so will help us meet our\r\ncommitments by providing land, river and air transport\r\nfacilities.\r\nThe chapter that we mentioned deals with many of the\r\nactivities by several agencies and organizations. The limits\r\nof time make it difficult to enumerate those activities.\r\nHowever, we are sure that those organizations and agencies\r\nhave discharged their mandates.\r\nWe share with the international community the great\r\ninterest it takes in human rights issues. We thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his keen interest in that area and hope\r\nthat he will be able to build the necessary institutions to deal\r\nwith human rights. We have participated effectively in the\r\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights. We have\r\nwarned and continue to warn against selectivity and double\r\nstandards when applying human rights standards. Human\r\nrights are fundamental and should not be politicized. Also,\r\nthe right to development is an inherent human right.\r\nAs regards the establishment of the post of a high\r\ncommissioner for human rights, it may be necessary for this\r\nsession and the working groups of the relevant Committees\r\nin focusing on the principle of establishing such a post to\r\nfocus on the parameters of the mandate and sphere of\r\ncompetence of that important post, as well as on the\r\nnecessary consensus which we hope will be achieved on this\r\nissue.\r\nAs for the fourth chapter concerning preventive\r\ndiplomacy, humanitarian assistance and conflict resolution,\r\nwe hope that \"An Agenda for Peace\" will be organically\r\nlinked to the development programme proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General. In this regard, we associate ourselves\r\nwith those who have spoken before us about the activities of\r\nthe Security Council which have intensified recently. We\r\nhope that the Security Council will take it upon itself to\r\nimplement its resolutions in a balanced manner that avoids\r\ndiscrimination. We hope that the General Assembly will be\r\na genuine partner in the making of resolutions relating to\r\ninternational peace and security. Preventive diplomacy and\r\nconflict resolution cannot be practiced unless they are\r\npursued in full cooperation with regional organizations.\r\nPeace cannot be preserved and maintained without removing\r\nthe causes of national and regional conflicts with all their\r\nsocial and economic aspects. We cannot but pay tribute to\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) which has been\r\nable to contain numerous conflicts in Africa, and hope that\r\nother regional organizations will follow suit.\r\nThe turmoil in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be\r\nconsidered by any yardstick as one of the successes of\r\npreventive diplomacy. Having said that, we command, from\r\nthis rostrum, United Nations successes in Cambodia and El\r\nSalvador while calling for a complete revision of its role in\r\nSomalia, especially with regard to departures from their\r\nmandates by United Nations forces in that country.\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 21\r\nMy delegation wishes to refer here, in particular, to\r\nparagraphs 492 and 493 of the report which relate directly\r\nto current events in Sudan. I wish to commend in this\r\nrespect the report’s highlighting of the many efforts\r\ndeployed by my country with the aim of ensuring delivery\r\nof humanitarian relief to all citizens without any\r\ndiscrimination whatever, wherever they may be, including\r\nthe areas of rebellion and military operations. This is a\r\nprecedent and model to be presented to the international\r\ncommunity, represented by Operation Lifeline and the\r\nensuing agreements between the United Nations,\r\ninternational non-governmental and voluntary organizations,\r\nas well as the rebellion movement, with all its various\r\nfactions in December 1992 and 1993, and with the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in March\r\n1993.\r\nWhile we consider paragraph 493 of the report on the\r\nSudan to be positive on the whole, we notice that it does not\r\nrefer with enough clarity to the mission of\r\nAmbassador Traxler or to the reasons of my Government’s\r\nreservations, at first, on that mission. My country’s position\r\nstemmed from the fact that the framework of Ambassador\r\nTraxler’s task had not been defined in an unambiguous\r\nmanner and that it was reported that the mission had\r\npolitical dimensions which encroached upon our national\r\nsovereignty as it was defined without prior consultation with\r\nmy Government. When the purely humanitarian framework\r\nof the mission was clarified, my country welcomed it and\r\nhospitably received the Ambassador, thus ensuring the full\r\nsuccess of the mission and the achievement of its objectives.\r\nSudan, in line with its ethical and cultural beliefs, has\r\nalways been faithful to the donors of assistance to its people.\r\nTherefore, the contents of paragraph 482 of the report which\r\nmentions the murder of United Nations staff who worked in\r\nhumanitarian programmes are indeed a source of sorrow to\r\nus. However, the report has remained silent with regard to\r\nthe parity that perpetrated this evil deed, namely the\r\nrebellion movement which has assassinated four relief\r\nworkers and launched numerous attacks on relief craft, thus\r\nturning this humanitarian effort into a weapon which it uses\r\nto starve and coerce the innocent into joining its ranks.\r\nI wish also to refer to paragraph 488 of the report\r\nwhich dealt with human suffering in a number of countries,\r\nincluding the Sudan.\r\nMy country absolutely believes the current conflict in\r\nsouthern Sudan cannot be resolved militarily but must be\r\nresolved through genuinely peace-oriented negotiations. We\r\ncall upon the international community to give its blessings\r\nto the efforts of the Sudan Government in this respect. By\r\nthe same token, those circles that lend material, moral or\r\npolitical support to the rebellion in southern Sudan should\r\ndesist from doing so in order to put an end to the human\r\nsuffering in the areas of conflict and since such support\r\nconstitutes interference in my country’s internal affairs.\r\nSudan has welcomed all initiatives by the leaders of\r\nKenya, Uganda and Nigeria and by international personages\r\nsuch as the former United States President Mr. Carter.\r\nSudan has also welcomed the recent initiatives of Presidents\r\nMoi, Museveni, Zenawi and Afwerki of Kenya, Uganda,\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea respectively aimed at reaching a\r\npeaceful solution to the conflict in southern Sudan through\r\nnegotiations and at breaking the present deadlock. In this\r\nspirit we maintain that the international community is duty\r\nbound to observe the principles of the Charter and\r\ninternational law in order to promote the peace efforts in\r\nSudan and to refrain from taking measures that would\r\ncontribute, in one way or another, to impeding the\r\nachievement of this objective.\r\nMr. PIRIZ BALLON (Uruguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): We should like first of all to express our\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General on the report\r\n(A/48/1) he has submitted to us on the work of the\r\nOrganization. We admire the exhaustive information he has\r\ngiven us and appreciate his deep analysis of the problems\r\nconfronting the Organization, problems that reflect the very\r\ncomplex reality the international community must face.\r\nThat objective reality is not fundamentally the result of\r\nanything the Organization, its Members or its leaders and\r\nadministration - that is, the Secretariat - have done or have\r\nfailed to do. The reality - the world situation in which we\r\nlive today - is the result of the collapse of an unjust political\r\norder that has not been replaced by the new order of peace\r\nand equity that all the peoples of the world had hoped for.\r\nThe resulting disorder manifests itself in xenophobia, racism,\r\nhistorical resentments, political intolerance, tribal conflicts\r\nand so on. Nor has there been any lack of illegitimate\r\npolitical ambitions on the part of individuals, nations and\r\nclans that, taking advantage of chaotic conditions, seek to\r\ngain ascendancy through force and violence.\r\nWe all recognize that the background and, in large part,\r\nthe primary cause of these ills is the influence of economic\r\nand social factors that affect developing countries in\r\nparticular. In this regard, the Secretary-General’s report\r\npoints out quite rightly the linkage between peace and\r\ndevelopment, and we eagerly look forward to the submission\r\nof the report on an agenda for development.\r\nIn the face of the potentially apocalyptic state of affairs\r\nwe have just described, this question arises: who, what\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nforces or what centres of power will be able to impose\r\norder? Equally important is the question of how a new\r\nsystem of international relations can be created and what\r\nform it will take, a system whose principles and norms\r\nreaffirm the concept of States while also recognizing the\r\nintrinsic rights of human beings. There seems to be no\r\nPower or alliance of Powers in the world that is willing and\r\nmaterially able to exercise its authority unilaterally, and let\r\nus be thankful for that. What is more, certain isolationist\r\ntendencies can be perceived. Apparently - and we should\r\nlike to believe it to be so - the fruit of the advances made in\r\ninternational ethics is the preference for achieving a new\r\norder based on multilateral, participatory action, though our\r\nhope is tempered by the evidence that, while all States are\r\nequal, some are more equal than others.\r\nHowever, there is a consensus that on the basis of\r\nparticipatory multilateralism it must be the United Nations\r\nthat carries out the laborious task of establishing an order\r\nthat is politically acceptable to all and that at the same time\r\naims at solving urgent economic and social problems. If we\r\ndecide to assign this crucial role to the United Nations, we\r\nmust recognize that the first priority must be to put out the\r\nfires, to halt, contain or at least mitigate conflicts. At the\r\nsame time, we shall have to act effectively and swiftly to\r\nattack the underlying causes of many of these tragedies:\r\nunderdevelopment, dire poverty and the unjust order that\r\nprevails in the economic and trade relations between nations.\r\nObviously, in order to take up such a formidable\r\nchallenge we need to strengthen the United Nations and\r\nmake sure that we do not thereby trample on inviolable\r\nprinciples such as the sovereignty of States, non-intervention\r\nand the self-determination of peoples. Strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations within these terms means faithfully\r\ninterpreting the Charter as regards the allocation of\r\ncompetencies among the various organs of the system.\r\nIn this context we must also strengthen the Secretariat’s\r\ncapacity for taking initiatives and expressing views, but not\r\nof taking decisions. In this connection, my country has from\r\nthe outset paid tribute to the Secretary-General for his\r\nproposals in \"An Agenda for Peace\". In addition, for\r\nreasons of urgency, many of the initiatives suggested therein\r\nhave been implemented in the course of events through\r\naction by the Security Council and in most cases with the\r\ntacit or express approval of the General Assembly or the\r\nMember States.\r\nIf we are to judge the Secretariat’s performance, let us\r\nnot beat around the bush: we would excuse certain errors\r\nthat may have been committed, but what we would not\r\nexcuse is the inertia of a body under the control of Member\r\nStates that is asked, in view of the urgency of the situation,\r\nto produce concrete ideas and suggestions.\r\nIn that regard we believe that the strengthening of the\r\nOrganization must lead to greater effectiveness in the\r\nexecution of the mandates entrusted to the Secretary-General.\r\nFor this reason, in the case of interim offices, though we\r\nfully share the position of the Group of 77 that such offices\r\nmust never assume political functions, we recognize as quite\r\nvalid the desire to impose greater coordination and\r\neffectiveness on operational activities, in keeping with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/199. This subject could\r\nalso be dealt with in the context of the questions related to\r\nthe process of restructuring the economic and social system.\r\nIn any case, such an approach would help to clear up\r\nmisunderstandings and ease concerns regarding the character\r\nand competencies of those offices.\r\nIn summary, this and other subjects and ideas dealt with\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report deserve our Government’s\r\nspecial attention. We are prepared to consider them and\r\ntheir adoption so long as, in the General Assembly and other\r\nbodies, we have removed certain elements in which, for the\r\nsake of pragmatism and effectiveness, the constitutional\r\nauthority of the Secretariat may be exceeded. This is the\r\nvery criterion we apply when examining the paragraphs on\r\npreventive diplomacy and the future of peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nUruguay believes that the net result of what has been\r\ndone is unquestionably positive. Millions of people all\r\nacross the world can bear witness to the effective action of\r\nthe Organization, and Uruguay is very proud to take part in\r\nthis collective enterprise.\r\nWe regard peace-keeping operations as an element in\r\nthe political settlement of a given conflict through the\r\ncreation of a climate of stability. Obviously, however, they\r\nare not appropriate to every crisis.\r\nWhat, then, are the prerequisites for the deployment of\r\na peace-keeping force?\r\nIn our opinion, the first is strict compliance with the\r\nprinciples of international law, as enshrined in the Charter -\r\nin particular, the peaceful settlement of dispute, non-\r\nintervention in internal affairs, and the self-determination of\r\npeoples.\r\nThe second prerequisite is the existence of a viable,\r\nprecise and well articulated mandate, providing, so far as\r\npossible, a realistic timetable - something that requires a\r\nSecurity Council decision based on reliable information. We\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 23\r\nare very happy to note the steady improvement in the\r\nformulation of peace plans and the tendency to approve very\r\nclearly defined mandates. Similarly, we warmly welcome\r\nthe increase in the planning capacity of the Secretariat,\r\nwhich should be manifested in expansion of the Department\r\nof Peace-keeping Operations.\r\nThe third important factor is unified command and\r\ncontrol by the Secretary-General, under the political\r\nsupervision of the Security Council. Strict implementation\r\nof this principle is essential to the success of any operation.\r\nUnified command must be scrupulously respected.\r\nFourthly, the safety of personnel - military or civilian -\r\ninvolved in operations must, so far as possible, be\r\nguaranteed. In this respect, we welcome the recent Security\r\nCouncil resolution on the subject and General Assembly\r\nresolution 47/120 B. We support the initiative of New\r\nZealand and Ukraine in proposing that the Sixth Committee\r\ndiscuss the preparation of a draft convention on the security\r\nof personnel.\r\nFifthly, there must be adequate financing. This will\r\nnecessitate careful supervision of the budget and of the\r\nconduct of the operation and a renewed formal commitment\r\nby countries to pay their contributions fully and on time.\r\nThe sixth requirement is the non-use of force. Action\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter or operations with broad\r\nmandates, in what might be called the grey area - including\r\nthe imposition of sanctions and the use of force - should be\r\nundertaken only after the failure of political measures as\r\nprovided for in Chapter VI.\r\nFaced with the crises in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia,\r\npeople yield easily to frustration and to the temptation to\r\nindulge in criticism of United Nations actions. We do not\r\nbelieve that the Organization is above criticism. On the\r\ncontrary, we are quite prepared to make whatever\r\ncontribution we can to its improvement. However, before\r\nengaging in blind, emotional criticism, we must give some\r\nthought to the fact that the United Nations is only the sum\r\nof its Members. Thus, we are all bound to its successes and\r\nits failures. In varying degrees, but collectively, we are all\r\nresponsible for the fruits of the labours of the Organization.\r\nMr. MISHRA (Nepal): The Secretary-General has\r\ndescribed his annual report to the General Assembly as the\r\nlongest for many years. My delegation greatly appreciates\r\nhis comprehensive overview of the activities of the United\r\nNations during the past year.\r\nThe issues dealt with in the report relate to several\r\nmajor items before the General Assembly at the current\r\nsession. My delegation will deal with them as appropriate\r\nwhen the relevant agenda items are taken up at plenary\r\nmeetings or at meetings of the Main Committees. I have in\r\nmind, in particular, the Secretary-General’s views with\r\nregard to peace-keeping operations. At this stage, I wish to\r\nmake a few general observations.\r\nMy delegation shares the Secretary-General’s opinion\r\nthat the United Nations has a central role to play in\r\nadvancing peace, security and development. In this context,\r\nI wish to refer to the address given by the Prime Minister of\r\nNepal last Wednesday, in the course of the general debate.\r\nThe Prime Minister said that bridging the gap between the\r\ndeveloped and the developing countries is an integral part of\r\nthe efforts to strengthen world peace and security. He said\r\nalso that the current climate in international relations\r\npresents an opportunity to reactivate North-South dialogue\r\nand to enhance South-South cooperation. With this\r\nexpectation, my delegation looks forward to the\r\nSecretary-General’s agenda for development, which, we\r\ntrust, will provide firm ground for an exchange of views on\r\na framework for concrete action to promote international\r\ncooperation for development.\r\nThe delegation of Nepal agrees with the\r\nSecretary-General that it is important to promote democracy\r\nin all aspects of international relations - particularly within\r\nthe United Nations system. In this exercise, the General\r\nAssembly occupies one of the most important positions.\r\nTogether with fellow members of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, Nepal has supported the proposals aimed at\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly. We are pleased that you,\r\nMr. President, intend to continue this process during the\r\ncurrent session.\r\nOn the question of strengthening the United Nations, it\r\nis important that action be taken to ensure that the Security\r\nCouncil is representative in character and that there is\r\ntransparency in its activities. We have communicated to the\r\nSecretary-General our views on the composition of the\r\nCouncil. My delegation looks forward to a more detailed\r\ndiscussion of this question later in the session.\r\nMy delegation will provide all possible support for the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to streamline the Secretariat and\r\nthe Organization’s presence in the field. We understand that\r\nthe Secretary-General is motivated by the desire to increase\r\nefficiency and cost-effectiveness. Nepal, as a least-\r\ndeveloped country, values the multilateral assistance for its\r\ndevelopment efforts. My delegation therefore emphasizes\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthat restructuring and streamlining should not be at the cost\r\nof the loss of programmes and projects for development.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General, \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\", was the subject of extensive discussions during the\r\nforty-seventh session. The General Assembly has adopted\r\ntwo important resolutions dealing with various proposals of\r\nthe Secretary-General. My delegation believes that the\r\nconcepts and proposals in \"An Agenda for Peace\" are\r\nevolutionary. This is an ongoing process, and my delegation\r\nis ready to cooperate in further discussions.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: A number of delegations have\r\nasked to speak in exercise of the right of reply, and I shall\r\ncall on them now.\r\nMr. ANSARI (India): My delegation asked to speak at\r\nthis late hour only on account of the remarks relating to my\r\ncountry in the statement on this agenda item by the\r\nrepresentative of Pakistan. My Government has taken note\r\nof the paragraph on India and Pakistan in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report to the General Assembly. It appreciates his\r\nreference to the Simla Agreement and to the commitment\r\ntherein of the two sides to resolve the issues peacefully,\r\nthrough negotiations.\r\nThe Government of India reaffirms its belief that such\r\nnegotiations should be conducted bilaterally, in the letter and\r\nspirit of the Simla Agreement, and without external\r\ninterference, and calls upon the Government of Pakistan to\r\neschew the path of violence and terrorism and revert to the\r\nSimla process for resolving bilateral issues, in the larger\r\ninterests of the peoples of the two countries.\r\nMy delegation has noted with surprise and dismay the\r\neffort by the delegation of Pakistan in the General Assembly\r\ndeliberately to engineer an atmosphere of crisis. It is our\r\napprehension that the purpose is to avoid bilateral\r\ndiscussions. That apprehension seems to be confirmed by\r\nthe language used by representatives of Pakistan in briefing\r\nforeign Governments on the subject. One sentence reads:\r\n\"The present Government of Pakistan is fully\r\ncapable of conducting talks. However, we are not\r\nanxious for talks with India\".\r\nMembers may wish to note the expression used: \"capable\",\r\nbut not \"anxious\".\r\nI submit that the unwillingness is because Pakistan has\r\nopted for the paths of subversion, terrorism and hostile\r\npropaganda against India as its principal instruments of\r\npolicy. Each of those violates the bilateral agreements\r\nreferred to by the Secretary-General in paragraph 352 of his\r\nreport.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I would appeal to representatives\r\nto be as brief as possible, as the hour is late.\r\nMr. KHAN (Pakistan): I shall be as brief as possible,\r\nkeeping in mind the statement of the Indian representative.\r\nFirst, I note with satisfaction that the Indian\r\nGovernment has at least taken note of the relevant paragraph\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report. That is heartening. But\r\nwhat followed was very disheartening. Yes, there is a Simla\r\nAgreement between Pakistan and India. The Simla\r\nAgreement does not preclude discussion or deliberation of\r\nthis issue in international forums. There are Security\r\nCouncil resolutions - numerous Security Council resolutions\r\n- which mandate that the final disposition of the Jammu and\r\nKashmir dispute should be in accordance with the wishes of\r\nthe people, through a free and impartial plebiscite under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations. So the Simla Agreement is\r\nnot restrictive. As a matter of fact, it was one of the efforts\r\nmade by Pakistan in good faith to solve this problem.\r\nI would also like to point out that the Simla Agreement\r\nwas signed in 1972. Twenty-one years have passed. Has\r\nIndia once, just once, seriously proposed discussing the\r\nJammu and Kashmir issue under the Simla Agreement?\r\nYes, it has been making statements to the press; it has been\r\nusing it for propaganda purposes; but has it ever discussed\r\nor proposed discussing this issue under the Simla\r\nAgreement? Pakistan has indeed proposed discussing this\r\nissue under the Simla Agreement, but India rejected that\r\noverture from Pakistan.\r\nAnother allegation: We should \"eschew terrorism\".\r\nWell, we are not indulging in terrorism. It is India which is\r\nindulging in the worst kind of terrorism, the kind called\r\nState terrorism. And it is suppressing and subjugating a\r\nterritory which does not belong to it. That territory is under\r\nits unlawful occupation, as recognized by the United\r\nNations, as recognized by the international community - as\r\nrecognized by India itself. It should read the Security\r\nCouncil documents again: it should also go back and read\r\nthe resolution of 5 January 1949 which solemnizes the\r\nagreement between Pakistan and India to make all necessary\r\narrangements for holding a free and impartial plebiscite.\r\nWhere has that commitment gone? Are Indians becoming\r\na victim of growing amnesia? Are they forgetting their\r\ncommitments? Or is this a deliberate tactic to confuse\r\ninternational opinion?\r\n31st meeting - Friday, 15 October l993 25\r\nThey are surprised and dismayed that what Pakistan is\r\ndoing is \"engineering\". But it is not \"engineering\"; it is a\r\ncall from Pakistan, and it is our right to make that call, in\r\nthe light of what is happening in Kashmir, the gruesome\r\ntragedy that is taking place in Kashmir. Some 40,000\r\npeople have been killed; women have been raped by security\r\nforces with impunity - in certain cases with wantonness - as\r\na part of their well-conceived strategy to terrorize people\r\ninto submission. Is this being \"engineered\" by Pakistan? If\r\nanybody is the author of the situation, it is India, not\r\nPakistan.\r\nThen they say that Pakistan has said, in one of its\r\nnon-papers, which were circulated, that Pakistan’s present\r\nGovernment is fully capable of, but is not interested in,\r\ndialogue with India. Well, they must read their own non-\r\npaper, which preceded our non-paper; in it, they said that\r\nPakistan had an interim Government and that therefore it\r\nwas not appropriate for India to enter into negotiations with\r\nthat Government. We clarified the fact that our interim\r\nGovernment, like all other Governments, is competent to\r\ntake up this issue.\r\nThen they talk about \"subversion and terrorism\". For\r\nGod’s sake, we must be honest about this. The worst\r\npractices of terrorism are committed by India itself. I have\r\nthe facts and figures, but because of the lateness of the hour\r\nI will not go into them. But I can enumerate 20 training\r\ncamps concentrated along the Pakistan-India border, which\r\nare training terrorists and sending them across to Pakistan.\r\nThey have been involved in 101 terrorist activities: bomb\r\nexplosions, arson. What they are doing in Kashmir they also\r\nwant to do in Pakistan.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We are well beyond the closing\r\ntime, but the representative of India wishes to speak again.\r\nI call on him, with the appeal that he, too, be as brief as\r\npossible.\r\nMr. ANSARI (India): Thank you, Sir. I do not know\r\nthe punishment in criminal law for the offence of flogging,\r\nbut that is what the delegation of Pakistan have inflicted on\r\nthis Assembly. They flog an argument without sustaining it.\r\nThey indulge in what logicians call systematically misleading\r\nexpressions.\r\nThey tell us not the time and date on which the\r\nGovernment of Pakistan implemented part II A of the\r\nresolution adopted on 13 August 1948 by the United Nations\r\nCommission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP) - a resolution\r\nso often and so selectively cited by them. They explain not\r\nhow part III of the same resolution could ever have been\r\nimplemented without the completion of the total withdrawal\r\nof Pakistani troops from Jammu and Kashmir, as stipulated\r\nin part II. They reveal not how the pulsation of time and\r\nspace, and the movement of the chariot of history itself,\r\ncould have been stalled.\r\nAbove all, they explain not the annexation to Pakistan\r\nof a part of Jammu and Kashmir known as the Northern\r\nAreas, for which they were indicted by one of their own\r\nhigh courts very recently - in March this year. They admit\r\nnot their own culpability and tax, instead, the credulity of\r\nthis Assembly. They do take too much for granted.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The representative of Pakistan\r\nwishes to speak in exercise of the right of reply. I call on\r\nhim, and appeal to him to be brief.\r\nMr. KHAN (Pakistan): The Assembly must have been\r\nimpressed by the sophistry of the Indian representative’s\r\npresentation, but not by the strength of his argument,\r\nbecause the allegation that Pakistan was somehow\r\nresponsible for the non-implementation of the UNCIP\r\nresolution in question is false and unsubstantiated.\r\nLet me remind the representative of India that the\r\nquestion of demilitarization applied to Jammu and Kashmir\r\nterritory as a whole and not to Azad Jammu and Kashmir\r\nalone. Pakistan did comply with the provisions spelled out\r\nin the Security Council resolutions, but when the time came\r\nfor the withdrawal of Indian forces, India wriggled out of its\r\ncommitment, offering many excuses. Sir Owen Dixon, the\r\nUnited Nations Mediator, was constrained to report that\r\nIndia was insisting on conditions that made the holding of a\r\nfree and impartial plebiscite impossible.\r\nIndia also frustrated the efforts of Mr. Graham, the\r\nsuccessor of Sir Owen Dixon, aimed at the withdrawal of\r\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe bulk of Indian forces. India was not interested in a\r\nplebiscite and it was determined to hold on to Kashmir.\r\nTowards the end of 1950, India, in contravention of the\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, took steps towards the total\r\nintegration of Kashmir by convening the so-called\r\nConstituent Assembly. Thus, right from the beginning it\r\nwas India that stalled the implementation of the Security\r\nCouncil resolutions by turning down all proposals for the\r\ndemilitarization of Jammu and Kashmir, which would have\r\npaved the way for a plebiscite.\r\nAs for the Northern Areas, I would like to tell the\r\nrepresentative of India and this Assembly that the Northern\r\nAreas have not been annexed to Azad Kashmir or to\r\nPakistan. As a matter of fact, they have a special status.\r\nWe are ready for a plebiscite today, and we are ready to\r\nmake appropriate administrative arrangements as and when\r\ndefined by the Security Council, if India is ready.\r\nThe representative of India’s reference to the High\r\nCourt judgement is out of context and has no bearing on the\r\nquestion of the holding of a plebiscite in the whole of\r\nKashmir. Are they trying to suggest that the right of self-\r\ndetermination is to be exercised only in Azad Kashmir, in\r\none part of Pakistan, and that India is not going to allow it\r\nto be exercised in occupied Kashmir? This is illogical, to\r\nsay the least.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: It is customary for the Assembly\r\nto take note of the annual report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe work of the Organization. If I hear no objection, may I\r\nconsider that the Assembly wishes to take note of the report?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have thus concluded this stage\r\nof our consideration of agenda item 10.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.45 p.m.\r\n"
