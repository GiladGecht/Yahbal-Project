"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n32nd\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nTuesday, 19 October 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10:20.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 47\r\nCOMMEMORATION OF THE FIFTIETH\r\nANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN 1955\r\n(a) REPORT OF THE PREPARATORY\r\nCOMMITTEE FOR THE FIFTIETH\r\nANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS\r\n(A/48/48)\r\n(b) DRAFT RESOLUTION (A/48/L.7)\r\n(c) DRAFT DECISION (A/48/48, sect. III)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now request the Rapporteur of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations, Her Excellency Mrs. Lucille Mathurin\r\nMair of Jamaica, to introduce the report of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee.\r\nMrs. MATHURIN MAIR (Jamaica), Rapporteur of the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations: It is my pleasure and honour to present the\r\nreport of the Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary of the United Nations, contained in document\r\nA/48/48.\r\nSection I of this report, \"Background and introduction\",\r\nreminds us that at the 76th plenary meeting of the forty-sixth\r\nsession, the General Assembly decided on the\r\nrecommendation of the General Committee to include in the\r\nagenda of its forty-sixth session this item, \"Commemoration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations in 1995\".\r\nThe General Assembly subsequently adopted a decision\r\n(46/472), by which it established a Preparatory Committee\r\nfor the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, consisting\r\nof the members of the General Committee and open to the\r\nparticipation of all Member States, and entrusted the\r\nPreparatory Committee with the task of considering and\r\nrecommending to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh\r\nsession proposals for suitable activities in connection with\r\nthe observance of the fiftieth anniversary. Subsequently, the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in December 1992, considered the first\r\nreport of the Preparatory Committee (A/47/48). The General\r\nAssembly at that time took note of the work of the\r\nCommittee in 1992 and mandated the Preparatory Committee\r\nto continue its work and report to the Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session. The present report as submitted in response\r\nto that decision.\r\nThe Preparatory Committee has held five meetings - in\r\nFebruary, March, April, May and June. At a particularly\r\nimportant meeting on 22 February 1993, the Committee had\r\nbefore it a note by the Chairman (A/AC.240/1993/L.4),\r\nwhich elaborated on the organization of the work of the\r\nCommittee, as well as the substantive issues requiring its\r\nconsideration. This note provided a useful basis for the\r\nfurther deliberations of the Committee, subsequently updated\r\nin a draft annotated agenda (A/AC.240/1993/L.5) in March\r\n1993, which was approved.\r\nAt its 3rd and 4th meetings in the course of this year,\r\nthe Committee gave consideration to the basic principles\r\nwhich should be applied in the organization of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary and agreed on the following: that the United\r\nNations activities in connection with the fiftieth anniversary\r\nshould be, to the extent possible, universal in character and\r\nin keeping with the universality of the membership of the\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86909 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.32\r\n9 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nUnited Nations; that there should be a clear allocation of\r\nfunctions and activities between the United Nations system\r\nand Member States, to ensure that there was no duplication;\r\nthat a suitable climax to the fiftieth anniversary would need\r\nto be identified, and that the climax should have universal\r\nimportance, be enduring in its effect and have a suitable\r\nsymbolic value; and also that activities should be conducted\r\nin and made available in all official languages.\r\nOn the subject of the theme of the anniversary, the\r\nCommittee devoted a considerable amount of time and effort\r\nto reaching agreement. The common focus of the proposals\r\nmade was the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nfundamental concepts that it expressed. It was also stressed\r\nthat the theme should be forward-looking and that it should\r\nbe widely relevant. The theme proposed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, \"We the peoples\", did receive considerable support\r\nfrom delegations; there was, however, a majority view that\r\nit needed to be extended and made more specific. Following\r\nextensive deliberations, a consensus was reached in the\r\nCommittee on the following theme for the anniversary: \"We\r\nthe Peoples of the United Nations ... United for a Better\r\nWorld\". This was accepted as an appropriate expression of\r\nthe theme of the fiftieth anniversary.\r\nThe preparation of a declaration and the establishment\r\nof a drafting group were important activities of the\r\nPreparatory Committee. It was proposed at a meeting in\r\nMarch that there should be an open-ended drafting group\r\nestablished to prepare a solemn declaration to mark the\r\nobservance of the anniversary. That declaration should\r\nreaffirm adherence by Member States to the principles of the\r\nCharter and should guide the Organization’s work for the\r\nfuture. That proposal was adopted without dissent.\r\nHowever, there were differences of opinion on when the\r\ndrafting group should begin its work. Some felt that it\r\nwould be premature to begin work on a text at that early\r\nstage, when it might be overtaken by events and have to be\r\nrevised later. Others felt that the work should begin\r\nimmediately, as time was needed to reflect on elements to be\r\nincluded in the declaration. Following discussion, and on\r\nthe recommendation of the Chairman of the Committee, it\r\nwas agreed that the work of the drafting group should take\r\nplace in two phases: consideration of conceptual issues, in\r\nthe first instance, to be followed by drafting at a later stage.\r\nAs a result, the 1st meeting of the open-ended drafting group\r\nwas held on 22 June 1993, when the conceptual framework\r\nfor the declaration was discussed.\r\nThe action by Member States, including the\r\nestablishment of national committees, was a major concern\r\nof the Preparatory Committee. The Chairman referred in\r\nthis connection to a note which was sent by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to all Permanent Representatives, drawing attention\r\nto the importance of establishing national committees for the\r\nfiftieth anniversary to provide a channel for each country’s\r\nactivities with regard to the anniversary.\r\nAs paragraph 10 of the report before us indicates, the\r\nSecretary-General has received information from a number\r\nof States - the 13 here listed - in which national committees\r\nhave been established, and there are other Member States\r\nthat have established their intention to establish national\r\ncommittees. The committee wishes to congratulate and\r\nencourage those Member States and hopes that others will\r\nsoon establish national committees.\r\nAlso following a request by the Committee, the\r\nSecretariat had prepared a paper entitled \"Status of the\r\ncommemorative programme\" (A/AC.240/1993/CRP.5). This\r\nlist compiled by the Secretariat of proposed events and\r\nactivities was aimed at fostering projects with a global\r\ncomponent and outreach that were awaiting funding. The\r\nlist was divided into three main categories: first,\r\ncommunication/education projects that would promote\r\nawareness of the history, structure and functions of the\r\nUnited Nations, increase grass-roots support of the\r\nOrganization, improve world-wide education about it and\r\nhighlight the full range of issues on the Organization’s\r\nagenda; secondly, commemorative projects, which would\r\nreview past achievements of the United Nations with a view\r\nto promoting its future; and thirdly, celebratory events. The\r\nSecretariat, as the Committee was informed, had reviewed\r\nand evaluated approximately 180 unsolicited proposals.\r\nSome met the key criteria for evaluation (particularly the\r\nextent to which a particular project furthered the purposes of\r\nthe United Nations, educated and informed the public, and\r\nwas self-funding), and these were in the process of\r\ndevelopment. Much of the programme is still in the\r\nplanning stage, and few national programmes had been\r\ninitiated, so it was considered premature to discuss these in\r\ndetail at this time.\r\nA very important aspect of the preparatory work for the\r\nfiftieth anniversary consists of the activities within the\r\nUnited Nations system, as discussed in paragraph 12 of the\r\nreport.\r\nThe Committee noted that the Secretary-General\r\nattached great significance to the system-wide nature of the\r\nanniversary, particularly since several of the specialized\r\nagencies and other organs would also celebrate their own\r\nanniversaries in or around 1995. It was agreed that within\r\nthe context of the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary,\r\nan extraordinary opportunity existed to highlight the\r\nmutually reinforcing goals of the United Nations and its\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 3\r\nsister organizations, and it was also noted that these issues\r\nwere being coordinated through the Administrative\r\nCommittee on Coordination (ACC) and focal points at the\r\nworking level. The Committee continues to monitor this\r\naspect with interest and requests that it be kept informed of\r\nfurther developments in that regard.\r\nThe role of non-governmental organizations is also\r\nperceived by the Preparatory Committee as a very important\r\nelement. The fiftieth anniversary should be a broad-based\r\nand popular commemoration. It was therefore agreed to\r\nencourage the participation of non-governmental\r\norganizations to the greatest extent possible, both at the\r\nnational and at the global levels. These organizations could\r\nprovide valuable communication and information networks\r\nfor the fiftieth anniversary as links between the United\r\nNations and its world-wide constituencies. The Committee\r\nfurther agreed that non-governmental organizations could\r\nparticipate in its meetings under the rules governing their\r\nparticipation in the work of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil.\r\nWith regard to financial and administrative issues, the\r\nCommittee has been informed that the financial situation of\r\nthe Organization precludes making funds available from the\r\nregular budget. The Secretary-General has therefore\r\nestablished for that purpose a Trust Fund for the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary Celebrations and urges Member States to\r\nsupport that initiative. Support is also being sought from the\r\nprivate sector, including a limited number of global sponsors\r\nand international licensees.\r\nIn addition to funding for commemorative programmes,\r\nthe need for adequate secretarial support was discussed by\r\nthe Committee at several meetings. It was agreed that it is\r\nessential to the effective functioning and proper management\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary that its secretariat be assured of\r\nadequate staff and related resources. The Chairman of the\r\nCommittee has been requested to raise this concern, this very\r\nimportant need, with the Secretary-General, as appropriate.\r\nFinally, the Preparatory Committee wishes to place\r\nbefore the General Assembly, and to recommend for\r\nadoption, the following draft decision, as contained in\r\nparagraph 16 of the report. It reads as follows:\r\n\"The General Assembly,\r\n\"Having considered the report of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations (A/48/48),\r\n\"Takes note of the work of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the fiftieth anniversary in 1993,\r\nincluding the decision that the theme for the\r\ncommemoration be ’We the Peoples of the United\r\nNations ... United for a Better World’ and that an open-\r\nended drafting group be established to prepare a\r\ndeclaration to be adopted in 1995 to mark the\r\nanniversary,\r\n\"Decides that the Preparatory Committee should\r\ncontinue its work and report thereon to the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session.\" (A/48/48, para. 16)\r\nAnnexed to this report is the list of the relevant\r\ndocumentation.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the Chairman of the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, Mr. Richard Butler of Australia, who will\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/48/L.7 in the course of his\r\nstatement.\r\nMr. BUTLER (Australia), Chairman of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United\r\nNations: May I begin by expressing my deep appreciation\r\nas Chairman of the Preparatory Committee to all those\r\ndelegations that have worked so hard during the last year to\r\nensure that our work of preparation for a great event in 1995\r\nhas started well and that there have been real achievements.\r\nI want to thank too Her Excellency the Ambassador of\r\nJamaica for the splendid work she has done today in\r\nintroducing to the Assembly the report of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee which is proposed today for adoption by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe are at a turning point. We have had about one year\r\nin which to begin the work of preparation for our fiftieth\r\nanniversary. We are at a turning point signified by what I\r\nhope will be the unanimous adoption today of the report of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee, contained in the document\r\nbefore the Assembly (A/48/48).\r\nThat turning point has four main features. During the\r\npast year, we adopted some organizing principles under\r\nwhich we would pursue the celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary and mark its importance. Chief among those\r\nprinciples is that whatever we do should be of universal\r\nsignificance.\r\nWe have adopted a theme for the anniversary as a\r\nconsequence of an extended debate in which we reflected on\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Organization. In\r\nparticular, looking into the future, we reflected on what it\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nwas that we wanted to say to the world, especially to the\r\nyouth of the world, that this Organization was about, and we\r\nreached agreement on that theme. That was an important\r\ndecision because it will suffuse all of what we do in 1995\r\nand as we look into the future.\r\nWe also agreed to establish a drafting group, open to all\r\nMembers of the Assembly, in which we would work on the\r\ndrawing up of a solemn declaration of 1995, submitted to the\r\nHeads of State or Government of all Member States, which\r\nwould add to the celebratory part of 1995 by setting out a\r\nseries of signposts that would guide the United Nations as it\r\nmoves towards the twenty-first century.\r\nWe also saw the establishment of a special secretariat\r\nfor the fiftieth anniversary, a secretariat quite properly\r\nh e a d e d b y a n U n d e r - S e c r e t a r y - G e n e r a l ,\r\nMrs. Gillian Sorensen, and charged with the task of ensuring\r\nthat the Secretary-General is properly aware of 1995 and that\r\nthe activities that we will design for celebration and\r\npromulgation of the anniversary have the full engagement of\r\nthe Secretary-General and the Secretariat of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThose are the four things that we have achieved in the\r\nlast year; those are the things that mean that we are at a\r\nturning point when we adopt this report today, and that we\r\ncan turn a corner towards 1994 and 1995 - a period in which\r\nwe must work actively in drafting, a period in which we\r\nmust spread the message of our theme around the world, a\r\nperiod in which Mrs. Sorensen and her secretariat can begin\r\nto set in concrete the celebratory and other aspects of 1995.\r\nIn the latter context, may I say that I am aware that\r\nthere are discussions under way in this House at present\r\nabout resources for that secretariat. In this connection I\r\nwould draw attention to paragraph 15 of our draft report, in\r\nwhich the view of Member States is made clear to the effect\r\nthat the secretariat charged with managing the fiftieth\r\nanniversary should be given adequate resources - and I want\r\nto underline that today. It is the view of the Committee -\r\nand I am sure the Secretary-General is aware of this - that\r\nMrs. Sorensen and her secretariat must be given adequate\r\nresources. There is no question in my mind that this can be\r\ndone from within existing staff establishment - possibly, for\r\nexample, from the Department of Public Information - so as\r\nto ensure that without negative budgetary effects the\r\nresources required are allocated to Mrs. Sorensen and her\r\nspecial task.\r\nThe report of the Fiftieth Anniversary Committee\r\ncontains a recommended draft decision in paragraph 16,\r\nwhich our Rapporteur has already introduced. It remains for\r\nme simply to say that I commend that draft decision to the\r\nAssembly, and I hope that it will adopted unanimously.\r\nThere is also a draft resolution before the Assembly in\r\nthe context of this agenda item. It relates to the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration\r\nof Moscow, signed on 30 October 1943. At the last meeting\r\nof the Preparatory Committee, it was proposed that a brief\r\ncommemorative session of the General Assembly should be\r\nheld on 30 October 1993 in order to mark the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Declaration of the Four Nations on\r\nGeneral Security, adopted in Moscow on 30 October 1943,\r\nin which reference was made to the establishment of a\r\ngeneral international organization, based on the principle of\r\nthe sovereign equality of all peace-loving States and open to\r\nmembership by all such States, for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The proposal that was\r\nmade to commemorate that event of 50 years ago was\r\nunanimously adopted by the Preparatory Committee.\r\nAs a consequence, in our role as Chairman of that\r\nCommittee, I have submitted, in the name of Australia, a\r\ndraft resolution, contained in document A/48/L.7, which\r\nquite simply calls for the Assembly to commemorate in its\r\nplenary meeting on 1 November this year the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Declaration of the Four Nations on\r\nGeneral Security, adopted in Moscow on 30 October 1943.\r\nWe cannot do this on 30 October because that is a Saturday.\r\nThe nearest day, therefore, is Monday, 1 November. I\r\npropose that this draft resolution, which is in conformity\r\nwith the expressed wish of the Preparatory Committee, be\r\nalso adopted unanimously.\r\nI will bring my remarks to a conclusion by expressing\r\nagain the gratitude that I feel as Chairman of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the very great interest that all delegations are\r\nshowing in this work. I would also express the hope that we\r\nwill have a good 1994, a year that will see an increase in the\r\ntempo in which we will begin work on drafting what will be\r\nan important declaration for 1995 and a year in which the\r\nsecretariat for the fiftieth anniversary, properly resourced,\r\nshould be enabled to continue its planning for a truly historic\r\ncelebration, in 1995, of the fiftieth anniversary of this Organization.\r\nMr. RIABIKA (Ukraine) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe United Nations, since its founding in 1945, when States,\r\nmanifesting their goodwill and the desire to live in peace and\r\nfriendship, laid the base for a truly universal Organization,\r\nhas played an ever-greater role in the life of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nFor me, as a member of the Parliament of the Republic\r\nof Crimea - an integral part of Ukraine - it is gratifying to\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 5\r\nrecall that the decision on the establishment of this universal\r\ninternational Organization to ensure peace and security was\r\nadopted at the Crimea Conference, held in Yalta in\r\nFebruary 1945.\r\nIt is our view that the remaining two years before the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Organization must be used to the\r\nutmost to determine the areas of activity and the role of the\r\nOrganization for generations to come. It is therefore\r\nextremely important that during this period States Members\r\nof the United Nations exert maximum efforts for the drafting\r\nand implementation of coordinated proposals to reform the\r\nOrganization and adapt its structures to the demands of the\r\ntimes. The activities of the Preparatory Committee for the\r\nFiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations are designed to\r\nfacilitate this process.\r\nThe anniversary should be used to disseminate\r\nknowledge about the United Nations and the expansion of its\r\nactivities in order to familiarize the broadest circles of the\r\nworld’s population with the aims and tasks of the United\r\nNations. That, in turn, would promote support for the\r\nUnited Nations in the fulfilment of all of its plans and\r\ninitiatives.\r\nTaking into account the importance of the upcoming\r\nevent and also the fact that Ukraine was one of the founders\r\nof the United Nations, the President of Ukraine, Leonid\r\nKravchuk, by his order of 18 May 1993 set up the National\r\nCommittee for the Celebration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations, headed by the Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ukraine, Anatoly Zlenko. It consists of heads of\r\nthe leading ministries and governmental institutions,\r\nprominent public and political figures, parliamentarians,\r\nscientists and representatives of cultural and educational\r\nestablishments.\r\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the United\r\nNations Preparatory Committee, a draft programme of events\r\nwhich will take place at the national level within the\r\nframework of the United Nations commemoration was\r\nworked out and submitted for the Government’s approval.\r\nThe programme includes, inter alia, the holding in Ukraine,\r\nand particularly in the Crimea, of international scientific\r\nconferences, concerts, exhibits and cultural and sports events,\r\nas well as the issuance of postage stamps dedicated to the\r\nfiftieth anniversary. There are also plans for the\r\nestablishment in Kiev of a memorial park in which, on this\r\noccasion, trees will be planted by prominent political and\r\npublic figures.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations marks a\r\nspecial date in the calendar of international life. Bringing us\r\nback once again to the remote past, it prompts us to take a\r\ncloser look at the world to decide what we can do to make\r\nthe work of the United Nations more effective in fulfilling\r\nthose functions and tasks which were allocated to it nearly\r\nhalf a century ago.\r\nIt is generally known that not a single historic date is\r\noriented only towards the past. Moreover, the best way to\r\nobserve the anniversary of turning points of history is to\r\nconcentrate on unsettled issues, to reassess the existing\r\nsituation creatively and to outline the prospects for future\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn this context, we propose the convening, in the\r\nframework of the United Nations commemoration, of an\r\ninternational peace summit to summarize the development of\r\nthe world community in the post-confrontation era and\r\noutline the future world order for the next century. The\r\naims of this conference derive from the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). Those aims\r\ninclude the formulation of the concept of peace and security\r\nin the post-confrontation era.\r\nIn our view, such a forum should be timed to the\r\nOrganization’s anniversary and organized under the aegis of\r\nthe United Nations, because the development of\r\ncontemporary international relations cannot be imagined\r\nwithout this international Organization, whose prestige and\r\nreputation are universally recognized as very high.\r\nI should also like to emphasize another important factor\r\nin favour of holding such a conference within the United\r\nNations. Only the United Nations has the experience to\r\nconvene global high-level forums to consider complicated\r\nissues and set forth comprehensive approaches. Such\r\nmeetings could have a great mobilizing effect on world\r\ndevelopments, as attested to by the 1992 Conference in Rio\r\nde Janeiro. Furthermore, it would seem appropriate in the\r\ncourse of the global international conference to discuss and\r\nadopt new proposals and ideas, the realization of which\r\nwould energize the Organization’s activity and give it new\r\nimpetus.\r\nAs never before, we have every reason to see the\r\nUnited Nations as a powerful instrument capable of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, strengthening\r\njustice and human rights, and ensuring, to quote the United\r\nNations Charter, \"social progress and better standards of life\r\nin larger freedom\". This would correspond to the motto of\r\nthe commemoration: \"We the Peoples of the United Nations\r\n... United for a Better World\".\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMr. PIZARRO (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIn October 1995, the United Nations will celebrate its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. This will provide an opportunity for\r\nretrospection and an analysis of our achievements and\r\nfailures, and on that basis to conduct a profound assessment\r\nof the challenges that lie ahead for this Organization.\r\nIn December 1992, the Assembly considered the first\r\nreport of the Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary of the United Nations. Chile, which is a\r\nmember of that Committee and has been honoured with a\r\nvice-chairmanship, has worked hard to promote this\r\ninitiative. Similarly, at the national level, work has begun\r\non the basic principles to be applied in organizing this\r\ncelebration, in the total conviction that the commemoration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary offers an extraordinary opportunity\r\nfor highlighting the importance of the United Nations and\r\nthe other organizations of the system.\r\nThe Government of Chile has studied the note sent by\r\nthe Secretary-General on 3 February this year, in which he\r\nbrings to our attention the importance of establishing\r\nnational committees for the fiftieth anniversary to provide a\r\nchannel for each country’s activities with regard to the\r\nanniversary. In that connection, I am pleased to inform the\r\nAssembly that the establishment of the national committee\r\nin our own country is now being considered from the legal\r\nstandpoint, and we hope that it will be ready to begin its\r\nactivities by the end of this year, at the latest. The National\r\nCommittee will be entrusted with the coordination at the\r\nnational and international levels of our country’s\r\nparticipation in all the activities for the celebration, and will\r\nalso be in charge of organizing and publicizing all activities\r\nto promote awareness of its work.\r\nIt has also been considered fundamental to the desired\r\nsuccess of this National Committee that it be composed of\r\na broad spectrum of representatives of our principal national\r\norganizations. To that purpose, legal provisions stipulate\r\nthat it be composed of representatives of the Ministry of\r\nForeign Relations; the Ministry of Public Education; the\r\nMinistry of National Defence; the Ministry of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Government; the Ministry of Planning and\r\nInternational Cooperation; the Senate and the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the Republic; universities; and the\r\ndirectorships of the library, archives and museums; and that\r\nit be open to other institutions that might be invited by the\r\nCommittee towards the attainment of its goal.\r\nThe motto already agreed upon - \"We the Peoples of\r\nthe United Nations ... United for a Better World\" - gives us\r\nan appropriate framework for the success of this initiative.\r\nThat is why we support the work of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee and in particular the various publicity\r\nprogrammes and activities related to the Organization’s\r\nachievements and potential for the future, so that we might\r\nmake it a useful tool in the quest for solutions to the most\r\nburning problems afflicting the people of the world.\r\nDuring the general debate, one delegation quite rightly\r\npointed out that the United Nations itself should reflect the\r\nprinciples it advocates. Unfortunately, the reality today does\r\nnot bear out that assertion. The United Nations has not been\r\nable to adapt with the requisite speed to the changes our\r\nworld is experiencing. That is why work should be done, on\r\na priority basis and with the fiftieth anniversary as a\r\ndeadline, to achieve the restructuring of the United Nations,\r\nan appeal that has resounded through the statements of\r\ndelegations in the general debate.\r\nAmong the reforms that we feel are most urgent is that\r\nof the Security Council, with a view to achieving equitable\r\ngeographical representation. This reform, however, should\r\nalso make the Council efficient and a model of efficacy for\r\nany regional or subregional organization and the peoples of\r\nthe world in general. At the same time, the other organs of\r\nthe United Nations system need to proceed along the same\r\nlines so that, in all spheres, efficiency and harmonious action\r\nbecome the common denominator.\r\nThe convening of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in 1995 will be a key event in the celebration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. In that\r\nrespect, the chance to discuss the problems of human\r\nsecurity - in particular unemployment, poverty and social\r\nintegration - will be a unique opportunity for placing the\r\nhuman person at the heart of the concerns of the United\r\nNations and, at the same time, demonstrating the\r\nsignificance and global importance of our Organization.\r\nThe deep distrust that persists among the protagonists\r\non the international scene, the growing strategic interests that\r\nare at stake despite the end of the cold war, the vast\r\neconomic disparities, the increasing competition for\r\ninternational prestige, and the crisis of nationalism - all\r\nconstitute a genuine threat to the security of nations.\r\nAt the same time, we note that the world has changed,\r\nthat bipolarity has ended, that we are heading towards global\r\nunderstandings, that divisive barriers are being eliminated\r\nand that States are being recognized without ideological\r\nlitmus tests. In other words, the world and the United\r\nNations have begun to seek and find modern formulas for\r\nunderstandings between States and innovative solutions for\r\nthe problems that persist.\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 7\r\nAllow me at this point a personal digression. What I\r\nhave just said is applicable to situations such as Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, to what is going on in some of the republics of\r\nthe former Soviet Union, and to the case of China and\r\nTaiwan, where being members of the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation Council and the Asian Development Bank\r\nshould be a first step in encouraging them to work together\r\nin international organizations.\r\nResolving the questions I have mentioned is the task\r\nthat lies ahead of the international community, and a duly\r\nrestructured United Nations must channel its efforts to the\r\nattainment of that objective.\r\nAs we shall soon celebrate our fiftieth anniversary we\r\nmust redouble our efforts and strengthen our political will so\r\nthat by then we shall have modernized and democratized our\r\nOrganization, in order to enable it to face the challenges\r\nbefore it and focus its action on resolving the political,\r\neconomic and social problems now threatening humankind.\r\nChile pledges its determination to work from this day\r\nforward on that huge task.\r\nMr. TELLO (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIn almost exactly two years the United Nations, shaped by\r\na group of visionary statesmen in 1945, will reach its half\r\ncentury. That important anniversary is a source of special\r\nsatisfaction for the States that believed from the outset in an\r\ninternational community organized on basic principles of\r\ncoexistence. It also provides a unique opportunity for\r\nthoughtful reflection on the Organization ’s achievements\r\nand on its future.\r\nThe United Nations has come a long way since its\r\nfounding in San Francisco at the end of the Second World\r\nWar. In many ways it has exceeded the expectations of the\r\nauthors of its Charter.\r\nFrom a strictly quantitative standpoint, we note that\r\nmembership has more than tripled, as a result of the\r\ndecolonization process undertaken by the Organization and,\r\nmore recently, as a consequence of the end of the cold war.\r\nWhile this aspect is significant, the qualitative changes\r\nare in fact more important. United Nations activities are\r\nnow very wide-ranging - from peace-keeping in various\r\ncorners of the world to the active promotion of the economic\r\nand social development of peoples, and from the protection\r\nof human rights to the preservation of the environment. We\r\ncould say, to paraphrase the philosophers, that there is\r\nnothing that touches human beings that is not the concern of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nTo keep its central role on the international scene, the\r\nOrganization must respond to change by recognizing its\r\nshortcomings and correcting anachronisms.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Preparatory Committee’s\r\ndecision to establish an open-ended drafting group to prepare\r\na solemn declaration to be adopted here on 24 October 1995.\r\nDespite the view held by some, we must not waste what\r\nlittle time remains and must start as soon as possible the\r\nsubstantive work that will lead to a document whose content\r\nreflects what we expect of the United Nations in the next\r\ncentury.\r\nIn Mexico’s opinion, that important document could\r\ncontain three major chapters. The first would examine the\r\nground we have covered in the first 50 years, highlighting\r\nthe Organization’s achievements; the second would be\r\ndevoted to the problems facing the Organization today; and\r\nthe third, which would no doubt be the most extensive,\r\nwould conclude with a look towards the future in order to\r\ndirect our efforts and those of our successors.\r\nSome have expressed the view in the Preparatory\r\nCommittee that it would be premature to take pen in hand\r\nand begin the drafting, because - they say - of the speed\r\nwith which changes in the world order are taking place. In\r\nmy delegation’s opinion, they are being prudent to a fault.\r\nAny journey, however long and arduous, begins with the\r\nfirst step. We must continue the exchange of views that\r\nbegan a few short months ago and begin to draft a text that\r\nwe can alter as events require. What we cannot and must\r\nnot do is to leave everything to the last minute, since waiting\r\nso long would doom the declaration to failure.\r\nIn accordance with the request of this Assembly, a\r\nNational Committee charged with the commemoration of the\r\nOrganization’s fiftieth anniversary has already been set up in\r\nmy country. In view of the importance my Government\r\nattaches to this event, it was decided that the Foreign\r\nSecretary would chair the Committee, which is made up of\r\npersonages from governmental, academic and cultural fields\r\nlinked to the United Nations. The Mexican Committee has\r\nalready held two meetings, at which its members thoroughly\r\nexamined various programmes to disseminate knowledge of\r\nthe purposes, principles and work of the United Nations in\r\norder to make the Mexican people aware of the\r\nOrganization’s activities, and lead them to support those\r\nactivities.\r\nMeasures considered to date include the preparation and\r\npublication of books and other materials, the production of\r\nradio and television programmes, the organization of\r\nseminars and round tables on various subjects, with the\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nparticipation of Mexican and foreign experts, and the\r\nissuance of postage stamps. I shall soon have the privilege\r\nof informing the Preparatory Committee of the decisions the\r\nMexican national body will be taking in order to assure the\r\nattainment of its objectives.\r\nMexico is resolutely and enthusiastically planning the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. We are prepared to carry out an exercise in deep\r\nreflection, so that this very significant event will not amount\r\nmerely to expressions of jubilation and formal celebrations.\r\nWe are determined to continue to cooperate fully with the\r\nChairman of the Preparatory Committee, Ambassador\r\nRichard Butler of Australia, and with Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral Gillian Sorensen, with a view to ensuring that the\r\nfiftieth anniversary is accorded all the formal and substantive\r\nsignificance that it merits.\r\nMr. JACOB (India): My delegation attaches\r\nimportance to the celebrations to mark the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. We have been taking an\r\nactive part in the meetings of the Preparatory Committee,\r\nwhich is being ably guided by its Chairman, Mr. Richard\r\nButler, the Permanent Representative of Australia. We\r\nshould like to compliment Under-Secretary-General,\r\nMrs. Gillian Sorensen, who has been assisting the\r\nPreparatory Committee efficiently and with devotion. Her\r\nwholehearted and receptive approach to the ideas expressed\r\nby various delegations augur well for our collective\r\nendeavour to make the celebrations successful. The\r\nnewsletter on the preparations that she has started to publish\r\nis really useful.\r\nFor our part, we have formed in India a national\r\ncommittee, under the chairmanship of the External Affairs\r\nMinister, in connection with the fiftieth-anniversary\r\ncelebrations. I assure the Assembly that the Government of\r\nIndia and this national committee will do all in their power\r\nto ensure that the celebrations are meaningful and successful.\r\nThe completion of 50 years of the existence of the\r\nUnited Nations is an occasion for observance - indeed, for\r\ncelebration. The Organization, by its very existence, has\r\nserved as an anchor of hope for humanity. Having emerged\r\nas a harbinger of peace in a war-ravaged world, it has\r\nsurvived the trials and tribulations of half a century. The\r\nUnited Nations remained a silver lining on the cloudy\r\nhorizon of the cold war. Today, it has re-emerged as a\r\nmajor actor in international affairs, assuming unprecedented\r\ndimensions. The anniversary will be an occasion for helping\r\nto shape a new United Nations.\r\nAnniversaries are occasions for celebration as well as\r\nfor recollection. We certainly should rejoice at the distance\r\ntravelled. More important, however, is the road ahead, with\r\nthe ever-receding horizons that beckon us. In our view, the\r\nagenda for the fiftieth anniversary celebrations should be\r\nclosely focused on the Organization’s agenda for the future.\r\nExhibitions, television programmes, films and music\r\nperformances could certainly form a useful backdrop for this\r\nwider endeavour, but they should by no means become the\r\nbe-all and end-all of the exercise. It is my delegation’s view\r\nthat such a conceptual framework would help us to\r\nconcentrate on furthering the objectives of the United\r\nNations and on the responsibility that it will have to shoulder\r\nin the coming decades.\r\nOur own approach to observance of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary will be to place emphasis on those activities that\r\ncan help to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations,\r\nnot only as a political body but also as a catalyst for\r\neconomic and social development. Concerts and exhibitions\r\nare useful means of increasing awareness, among the masses,\r\nof the United Nations, but of greater importance will be\r\nthose activities that enhance the Organization’s constructive\r\nrole in world affairs. The occasion should be used to reflect\r\non the achievements of the Organization and to chart a\r\nwell-defined course for its future. We attach particular\r\nimportance, in this context, to the activities of specialized\r\nagencies, which should formulate programmes, specifically\r\ndesigned for the anniversary, that will reach their targets by\r\n1995. Observance of the anniversary should mark, not only\r\nthe culmination of the reform process, but also the beginning\r\nof new activities that will give the Organization a better\r\nimage in the world.\r\nLast but not least, it will be important to ensure that the\r\nanniversary functions are universal in character, and are seen\r\nto be so. Our purpose will be better served if they are\r\ndispersed over the globe rather than centred around United\r\nNations Headquarters or confined to a small group of\r\ncountries. In our view, the purpose of the exercise should\r\ntake precedence over procedural constraints relating to\r\norganizational and financial arrangements.\r\nDuring the meetings of the Preparatory Committee,\r\nMember States expressed wide-ranging and sometimes\r\ndiffering views on various aspects of the fiftieth-anniversary\r\ncelebrations. It is our hope that, in the true spirit of our\r\nwork in the United Nations, the preparatory work will be\r\ndone after the viewpoints of Member States have been\r\nharmonized. With these words, my delegation would like to\r\nendorse the draft decision of the General Assembly that the\r\nPreparatory Committee should continue its work.\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 9\r\nMr. HAJNOCZI (Austria): Let me begin by thanking\r\nAmbassador Butler for his able leadership as Chairman of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations. After extensive deliberations, the\r\nPreparatory Committee has achieved consensus on the theme\r\nfor the fiftieth anniversary:\r\n\"We the Peoples of the United Nations ... United for a\r\nBetter World\".\r\nThe first words of the Charter seem to us to set forth a\r\nparticularly meaningful theme. \"We the peoples\" clearly\r\nexpresses the concept that the United Nations constituency\r\nis not limited to Governments - that it is mankind.\r\nWe ought to seize the opportunity of this occasion to\r\nshow to the individual citizen the multiple effects of United\r\nNations activities. The support for the United Nations that\r\nwe should thereby build in the electorate would be\r\ntransformed into increased support from Governments.\r\nWe should heighten the awareness of programmes\r\nsponsored by the United Nations and of the Organization’s\r\nachievements, deepen knowledge about the Organization, and\r\ndemonstrate that it reaches out to every individual on the\r\nglobe.\r\nIn a nutshell, the fiftieth anniversary could be the\r\nbiggest public-relations event for the United Nations system.\r\nTherefore, particular emphasis should be laid on cooperation\r\nwith the media and with the education sector. We want to\r\nimbue, not just the adult population, but even more so the\r\nnext generation with the ideals of the United Nations. Such\r\nan approach, which might be called a public-awareness\r\noperation, would not put a heavy burden on the United\r\nNations budget. Rather, in our view, would it depend on\r\ncreativity, initiative and the ability to attract interest in\r\nsectors beyond governmental structures.\r\nA well-deserved tribute must be paid to\r\nUnder-Secretary-General Gillian Sorensen and her\r\npredecessor Joseph Verner Reed and their able colleagues in\r\nthe Secretariat who have been reaching out to the public in\r\ntheir work.\r\nWe share their view that the fiftieth anniversary should\r\nbe commemorated by activities at the global level.\r\nCertainly, United Nations Headquarters in New York and\r\nUnited Nations Offices at Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi offer\r\nexcellent bases and should be equally used. Likewise, the\r\nmany United Nations offices in Member States can play a\r\nsignificant role. The celebration of this important\r\nanniversary requires a truly system-wide effort.\r\nWe expect that many of the activities will be\r\nundertaken at national, regional and local level by\r\nnon-governmental organizations. Therefore the early\r\nestablishment of national committees is vital to initiate,\r\nliaise, focus and coordinate activities.\r\nAustria will actively participate in the drafting of a\r\nsolemn declaration to mark the observance of the\r\nanniversary in 1995. But our idea of the celebration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary is not a kind of ceremonial birthday party\r\non 24 October 1995. We prefer a broader perspective,\r\nviewing this commemoration as a substantial matter\r\nencompassing many activities and major meetings throughout\r\n1995, meetings such as the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and the World Conference on Women. For\r\nwhat would be the credibility of a solemn reaffirmation of\r\nadherence to the principles of the Charter on one day if we\r\ndid not live up to them every day of the year, by striving,\r\nunited, for a better world.\r\nMr. CATARINO (Portugal): Since this is the first time\r\nI have had the honour to speak in plenary meeting at this\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly, please allow\r\nme, Sir, to congratulate you on your election and wish you\r\nall the best in the conduct and fulfilment of your duties.\r\nPortugal follows with great interest the work of the\r\nUnited Nations and the constant enlargement of its activities\r\nfor the benefit of humanity. The sphere of influence of the\r\nOrganization has increased from day to day, covering areas\r\nof the utmost importance, such as peace-keeping operations,\r\neconomic development and cooperation, environmental\r\naction, humanitarian assistance and human rights - to\r\nmention but a few of the very important fields that have a\r\nreal impact on the well-being of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn this respect the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations is a special and unique\r\nopportunity to portray the work of the Organization and to\r\npresent a comprehensive picture of our efforts to attain goals\r\nto make a better world for us all.\r\nThat being so, I should like to inform the Assembly\r\nthat the Government of Portugal is taking the steps necessary\r\nto establish its national committee for the commemoration of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. We hope,\r\ntherefore, to be in a position in the near future to announce\r\nthe establishment of our national committee.\r\nMr. LOVINSKIY (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): The Russian Federation attaches great\r\nsignificance to preparations for celebrating the fiftieth\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. We assess very highly\r\nthe work of the Preparatory Committee for this anniversary,\r\nunder the leadership of the Permanent Representative of\r\nAustralia to the United Nations, Ambassador Richard Butler.\r\nWe also support his recommendations.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations must, in\r\nour view, become a compelling reaffirmation of the\r\nimportant role of the Organization in the life of the\r\ninternational community and the dedication of States\r\nMembers of the United Nations to the full application of the\r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations\r\nCharter 50 years ago.\r\nIn achieving international consensus on fundamental\r\ninternational problems, States are called on fully to make use\r\nof and develop the potential of the United Nations. Russian\r\ngovernmental bodies and public opinion have already\r\nundertaken preparatory work in connection with this notable\r\nevent in the life of the international community and a\r\nnational committee of the Russian Federation is being\r\nestablished.\r\nWe believe that it is extremely appropriate that the\r\nbeginning of the process for the celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary is taking place at this time. Fifty years ago at\r\nthe Moscow Conference of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs\r\nof the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States\r\nof America and the United Kingdom, which took place from\r\n19 to 30 October 1943, the concept of the establishment of\r\nan international organization for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security was proclaimed for the first\r\ntime. It was precisely then in that Declaration of the Four\r\nNations on General Security that the Governments of the\r\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and\r\nChina stated the need for the establishment of such an\r\norganization based on the principle of the sovereign equality\r\nof all peace-loving States and open to membership by all\r\nStates, large or small.\r\nThe delegation of the Russian Federation supports the\r\ndraft resolution submitted by the delegation of Australia in\r\nA/48/L.7 and calls for its adoption by consensus.\r\nMr. ELARABY (Egypt): The Assembly has before it\r\na very thoughtful and comprehensive report of the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. The report reflects, and in depth, the\r\ndiscussions in the Preparatory Committee, which was\r\nsuccessfully steered by its very able Chairman, Ambassador\r\nButler of Australia. We are also grateful to\r\nUnder-Secretary-General Gillian Sorensen and her very able\r\nand devoted staff.\r\nAs repeatedly stated by most delegations we are looking\r\nforward to a commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nwhich will not be limited to festive celebrations. My\r\ndelegation is of the view that the fiftieth anniversary\r\nprovides us with a unique opportunity to reflect on the\r\nachievements, the shortcomings and the performance of the\r\nUnited Nations since its establishment.\r\nWe should also be able to project into the future and\r\nseek to improve and enhance the performance of the United\r\nNations. We would like to consider the challenges that the\r\nOrganization will encounter in the future and how it will\r\ncope with those challenges. What areas should be reformed?\r\nWhat will the United Nations do to meet the challenges of\r\nthe future?\r\nThe founders of our Organization envisaged, through\r\nthe Charter, a very delicate structure for the United Nations,\r\na structure that survived the ravages of the cold war; now,\r\nwith the end of the ideological confrontation between East\r\nand West, the United Nations has a better opportunity to\r\nmeet the challenges of the future. Therefore it is only\r\nnatural to expect that States Members of the Organization\r\nwill use the fiftieth anniversary to review the balance sheet\r\nof the last 50 years and prepare for the future.\r\nEgypt has already established a national committee to\r\nprepare for the fiftieth anniversary, and will spare no effort\r\nin contributing to the meaningful success of the\r\ncommemoration.\r\nMr. SALMI (Finland): My country agrees with the\r\nmany representatives who have indicated that the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations will be a special occasion\r\nfor us, an occasion for reflection, taking stock and also\r\naction towards further developing and enhancing the work of\r\nour Organization, the better to meet the manifold and\r\never-increasing needs of the international community.\r\nMy delegation has already had the opportunity of\r\nparticipating actively here at Headquarters in the work on the\r\npreparation of the anniversary, and I have the pleasure to\r\ninform the Assembly that my Government is now taking\r\nsteps to form a national committee for the celebration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. The committee\r\nwill enjoy leadership at a high-level and will include a very\r\nwide spectrum of Finnish society.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We shall now proceed to consider\r\ndraft resolution A/48/L.7, as well as the draft decision\r\ncontained in section III of the report of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee contained in document A/48/48.\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 11\r\nMr. CHEN Jian (China) (interpretation from Chinese):\r\nBefore the draft decision contained in the report of the\r\nPreparatory Committee is adopted, I should like to point out\r\nthat the Chinese translation of the draft decision contains a\r\nlanguage error in the second preambular paragraph, which\r\nmentions the theme for the commemoration. The present\r\nChinese text does not fully reflect the spirit and meaning of\r\nthe original English.\r\nThe Chinese Government attaches high importance to\r\nthe activities for the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary and has established a national committee headed\r\nby Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. The\r\ntheme of the fiftieth anniversary will be widely publicized in\r\nChina; therefore, how the English for the theme of the\r\ncommemoration is reflected in the Chinese text is a major\r\nquestion. I do not wish to hold up the adoption of the theme\r\ntoday; however, with your permission, Mr. President, I\r\nshould like to conduct consultations with the parties\r\nconcerned in order to find the proper Chinese wording.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of China\r\nfor drawing our attention to the deficiency in translation, and\r\nI shall avail myself of his undertaking to consult with the\r\nSecretariat to ensure that the translation is corrected for any\r\nfuture document.\r\nOn that understanding, the Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/48/L.7 as well as the draft\r\ndecision contained in section III of the report (A/48/48) of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee.\r\nI now call on the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. SUKHODREV (Director of Security Council and\r\nGeneral Assembly Affairs): Under the terms of the draft\r\ndecision contained in section III of document A/48/48, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would, inter alia, decide that the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations should continue its work and report thereon\r\nto the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session, and that\r\nan open-ended drafting group should be established to\r\nprepare a declaration to be adopted in 1995 to mark the\r\nanniversary.\r\nIt is anticipated that the Preparatory Committee would\r\nneed to hold 24 meetings during 1994, and these would have\r\nto be added to the calendar of conferences. The extent to\r\nwhich the Organization’s permanent capacity would need to\r\nbe supplemented by temporary assistance resources can be\r\ndetermined only in the light of the calendar of conferences\r\nfor 1994-1995.\r\nHowever, provisions are made under section 25 of the\r\nproposed programme budget for 1994-1995 not only for\r\nmeetings programmed at the time of budget preparation but\r\nalso for meetings that would be authorized subsequently,\r\nprovided that the number and distribution of meetings and\r\nconferences are consistent with the pattern of meetings in\r\npast years.\r\nConsequently, should the General Assembly adopt the\r\ndraft decision contained in section III of document A/48/48,\r\nno additional appropriation would be required under the\r\nprogramme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We turn first to draft resolution\r\nA/48/L.7, entitled \"Fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of\r\nthe Four Nations on General Security\".\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.7?\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.7 was adopted (resolution\r\n48/6).\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We turn now to the draft decision\r\ncontained in section III of the report of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee, document A/48/48.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft decision contained in section III of the report (A/48/18)\r\nof the Preparatory Committee?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Under the terms of the resolution\r\njust adopted, the General Assembly will commemorate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of the Four Nations on\r\nGeneral Security on Monday, 1 November 1993. I should\r\nlike to point out that this commemoration will take place in\r\nthe afternoon as the second item.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our consideration\r\nof agenda item 47.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 155\r\nASSISTANCE IN MINE CLEARANCE: DRAFT\r\nRESOLUTION (A/48/L.5)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly has before it a draft\r\nresolution issued as document A/48/L.5.\r\nI call upon the representative of Belgium to introduce\r\nthat draft resolution.\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMr. NOTERDAEME (Belgium) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): On 20 August this year the 12 countries members\r\nof the European Community requested the inclusion of an\r\nadditional item in the agenda of the forty-eighth session of\r\nthe General Assembly entitled \"Assistance in mine\r\nclearance\". That item quickly gained broad support within\r\nthe Organization and among Member States, leading to the\r\nformulation of draft resolution A/48/L.5, which I have the\r\nhonour to introduce to the Assembly today on behalf of the\r\nsponsors, of which there are now 88. I ask the indulgence\r\nof members as I read out all their names.\r\nThe sponsors of draft resolution A/48/L.5 are:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria,\r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cape\r\nVerde, Costa Rica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark,\r\nDjibouti, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, El Salvador,\r\nEstonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Greece, Grenada,\r\nGuatemala, Guinea, Honduras, Hungary, India, Ireland,\r\nIceland, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho,\r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malawi,\r\nMalta, Mauritius, Monaco, Mongolia, Mozambique, Nepal,\r\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway,\r\nPakistan, Panama, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea,\r\nthe Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation,\r\nRwanda, Saint Lucia, San Marino, Sierra Leone, Singapore,\r\nSlovakia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Thailand, Togo,\r\nTunisia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland, the United Republic of Tanzania and the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\nI should like to thank sincerely all the delegations that\r\nhave given their support to and contributed to the drafting of\r\nthis text. The Secretariat, and in particular members of the\r\nmine-clearing unit, several United Nations agencies and the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, have shared their\r\nexperience with us. We should like to express our deep\r\ngratitude to them.\r\nThe sponsors are submitting their draft resolution to the\r\nAssembly because of the catastrophic situation created by\r\nthe massive presence of mines and other unexploded devices\r\nin countries that have experienced armed conflict.\r\nUnder the second preambular paragraph of draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.5, the Assembly would express dismay at\r\nthe high number of victims of mines and other unexploded\r\ndevices. Each year, such devices indiscriminately kill and\r\ninjure countless innocent victims, often children, long after\r\nweapons have fallen silent.\r\nUnder the third, fourth and fifth preambular paragraphs,\r\nthe Assembly would recall the adverse social and economic\r\nconsequences of the presence of mines. Vast territories are\r\ntoday unfit for the resumption of economic activities or the\r\nreturn of refugees already sorely tested by conflict.\r\nFurthermore, the presence of mines seriously jeopardizes the\r\nsafety of teams participating in humanitarian missions,\r\npeace-keeping and rehabilitation and seriously hampers their\r\naction.\r\nIn the following preambular paragraphs, the Assembly\r\nwould recall that in his report \"An Agenda for Peace\" the\r\nSecretary-General had already recognized the growing\r\nimportance of mine clearance and that the Security Council\r\nhad fully supported that report in a presidential statement of\r\n26 February 1993. In resolution 47/120 B the General\r\nAssembly also recognized the relevance of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s analysis. I would only add that in his latest report\r\non the work of the Organization the Secretary-General states:\r\n\"Of all the tasks involved in setting a nation on a\r\nnew road to peace and prosperity, perhaps none has the\r\nimmediate urgency of mine clearance.\" (A/48/1, para.\r\n459)\r\nFurther, the inhumane weapons Convention, which of course\r\nrelates primarily to prevention and humanitarian laws,\r\ncontains in Protocol II articles calling for international\r\ncooperation in the removal of mines.\r\nUnder the twelfth to fourteenth preambular paragraphs,\r\nthe Assembly would note with satisfaction the inclusion in\r\nthe mandates of several peace-keeping operations of\r\nprovisions relating to mine clearance and would welcome the\r\nestablishment within the Secretariat of a coordinated mine-\r\nclearance programme. It also commends the activities\r\nalready undertaken in this connection by the United Nations\r\nsystem, particularly by the Department of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs and the Department of Peace-Keeping Operations,\r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross and\r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nThe operative part of the draft resolution highlights the\r\nimportance of United Nations coordination of activities\r\ndesigned to facilitate the solution of problems linked by the\r\nfailure to remove mines.\r\nTo achieve such coordination it is necessary to begin by\r\nanalysing the precise parameters of the problem the United\r\nNations, its agencies, Member States and non-governmental\r\norganizations must confront because of mines. Then, an\r\ninventory must be drawn up of means, including financial\r\nmeans, available to them in dealing with the problem.\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 13\r\nIn operative paragraphs 4 and 5, therefore, the\r\nAssembly would request the Secretary-General to submit to\r\nthe General Assembly, before its forty-ninth session, a\r\ncomprehensive report on the problems caused by the\r\nincreasing presence of mines and other unexploded devices\r\nand on the manner in which the United Nations contribution\r\nto the solution of problems relating to mine clearance could\r\nbe strengthened. That report should also consider the\r\nfinancial aspects of activities related to mine clearance, and\r\nin that connection the General Assembly would ask the\r\nSecretary-General to consider the advisability of establishing\r\na voluntary trust fund.\r\nIf we are to assist the Secretary-General in drawing up\r\nhis report, many countries must extend their cooperation by\r\nproviding him with information, data and the views and\r\nsuggestions of their Governments. That is the purpose of\r\noperative paragraph 6.\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.5, before the General Assembly\r\ntoday, reflects the growing concern of the international\r\ncommunity at the devastation caused by mines and other\r\nunexploded devices in countries emerging from armed\r\nconflict. On behalf of the sponsors, I express the hope that\r\nit will be adopted without a vote.\r\nSpeaking now on behalf of the European Community\r\nand its member States, I pledge our full cooperation in the\r\npreparation of the report of the Secretary-General. We hope\r\nthat will contribute to the creation of an exhaustive chart\r\nshowing the needs resulting from the presence of mines, and\r\nthe means available for meeting them.\r\nThe European Community and its member States will\r\nbe following with special attention the follow-up to the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. In our view, today’s draft\r\nresolution is but the first stage of a long-term effort. We\r\nhope that at its forty-ninth session the General Assembly\r\nwill continue its deliberations on this item with a view to\r\nconsidering effective, urgent measures to help countries\r\naffected by the presence of mines to make progress towards\r\nsocial rehabilitation and economic reconstruction.\r\nMr. FARHADI (Afghanistan) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I wish first of all to convey the gratitude of my\r\ndelegation to the representative of Belgium and to the initial\r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/48/L.5, that is the countries\r\nmembers of the European Community, which have\r\nthemselves assisted many countries in mine-clearance\r\noperations.\r\nAfghanistan has joined in sponsoring the draft\r\nresolution, and I am addressing the Assembly on this item\r\nbecause my country is in a tragic and, unfortunately, typical\r\nsituation. In terms of the size of its population, Afghanistan\r\nheads the list of countries threatened by the dangers posed\r\nby mines. We learn from the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of June 1992 that ours is a typical case.\r\nIn my country, 45,000 mines have been documented in\r\nan area of 25 square kilometres. In all of Afghanistan there\r\nare undoubtedly more than 10 million mines. The danger\r\ncontinues even as we meet in this Hall; it is grave. In many\r\nvillages children are wounded every day as they play on\r\nmined ground. That shows how serious the problem is.\r\nSoviet military aggression in Afghanistan has ended; the Red\r\nArmy is no longer on our territory. But, with more than\r\n10 million mines, a latent aggression continues, with its\r\nattendant delayed danger of death or serious injury. This is\r\na case of \"delayed aggression\", with time-bombs scattered in\r\nan unknown pattern invisible to the naked eye. Most wars\r\nof aggression end with the withdrawal of the aggressor, with\r\na cease-fire, with a document, or with a hand-shake before\r\nthe cameras. But this kind of aggression persists after the\r\nconclusion of peace.\r\nIn the general debate, at the 24th meeting, on\r\n11 October, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan\r\nstressed the importance of this problem, and noted my\r\ndelegation’s support for a draft resolution on this item.\r\nThose are the reasons why Afghanistan has joined in\r\nsponsoring the draft resolution.\r\nI am grateful to the representative of Belgium also for\r\nhaving clarified a number of points that are made only\r\nbetween the lines of the draft resolution but that appear to\r\nhave been clear in the minds of the initial sponsors. Should\r\nthe draft resolution be adopted today - I hope without a vote -\r\nmy delegation will be satisfied with the text as it stands.\r\nBut if the initial sponsors wish to have suggestions for\r\npossibly important improvements and additions, it would be\r\nbetter to take note of these.\r\nAmong those points, let me note that it is not only\r\nhuman beings that are threatened by mines. Domestic\r\nanimals, notably the cattle used for agricultural and other\r\nwork, and wild animals can be gravely injured and could die\r\nfrom the effects of their wounds. This should certainly be\r\nof interest to the United Nations.\r\nSince the Second World War, technology has made\r\nprogress, in this case, unfortunately, with harmful\r\nconsequences for mankind. Mines from the First World War\r\nwere easily found, as they were made of metal, but most of\r\ntoday’s mines are made of plastics, which are terribly\r\ndifficult to detect. That is why mine clearance is an\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nextremely important specialization in today’s armies and\r\nministries of defence.\r\nA very important point that is not clear in the draft\r\nresolution is that the presence of mines militates against the\r\nreturn of war refugees, who wish to return now that the war\r\nhas ended. But when they learn from those who have\r\nalready returned that children have been injured when they\r\nstepped on mines, they are no longer so eager to return\r\nvoluntarily.\r\nThe question of reconstruction and rehabilitation has\r\nbeen mentioned. This is particularly important in agriculture\r\nat three stages: sowing, irrigation - so important for\r\ndeveloping countries where there is little rainfall - and the\r\nharvest. At each stage there is a danger for farmers - and\r\nfor their wives and children, who are generally involved in\r\nthese tasks, particularly in the harvest - of severe injury, or\r\neven death, because of lack of medical treatment. Those\r\nwho are seriously injured are at the mercy of all types of\r\ninfections and gangrene, which can be fatal.\r\nIn other areas, such as the reconstruction of roads, and\r\nother means of communication - above all, in the so-called\r\nwar-stricken countries, a sad new term - Afghanistan is again\r\nat the top of the list.\r\nIf additions are to be made to the draft resolution, at the\r\nvery least the question of returning war refugees to their\r\nhomes should be included in the preamble. An important\r\nitem should also be added to the operative part: an urgent\r\nappeal to countries able to assist those most seriously\r\nthreatened by mines to undertake mine-clearance\r\nprogrammes, including the training of local sappers.\r\nAfghanistan has already received such assistance from many\r\ncountries represented here, including Australia, which\r\nassisted in the training of local personnel for mine clearance,\r\npersonnel who have done a great deal and are still at work.\r\nThe Afghanistan operation is still huge, however, and we\r\nhope soon to receive expanded, concrete assistance,\r\nincluding assistance from Australia, which, for budgetary\r\nreasons, I believe, ceased for a time.\r\nWe hope to see the draft resolution adopted without a\r\nvote, by acclamation, under your presidency, Sir, I assure\r\nyou that among the resolutions we shall be adopting in this\r\nmanner this one will indeed be historic.\r\nMr. SUCHARIPA (Austria) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Austria welcomes the initiative of the European\r\nCommunity in having the question \"Assistance in mine\r\nclearance\" added to the agenda. We are pleased to be\r\nco-authors of the draft resolution with that title, which has\r\njust been introduced by the Permanent Representative of\r\nBelgium, and of course we hope that the draft resolution will\r\nbe adopted by consensus.\r\nThe Austrian delegation is extremely alarmed by the\r\ngrowing presence of mines and other unexploded devices in\r\nterritories devastated by armed conflicts. The presence in\r\nthe ground of these mines, long after hostilities have ended,\r\nis a grave obstacle to the restoration of peace and the return\r\nto normal productive daily life.\r\nIt is often those in the most disadvantaged sector of the\r\npopulation who run the greatest risk of being wounded,\r\nkilled or permanently disfigured by mines. They are often\r\nforced by the economic constraints from which they suffer\r\nto return to areas that are unsafe because of the continued\r\npresence of mines. The representative of Afghanistan, in a\r\nvery relevant statement, has just addressed this specific\r\nproblem.\r\nThe intense suffering inflicted on the very high number\r\nof victims of mines, primarily among the civilian population,\r\nis an unacceptable affront to the conscience of mankind.\r\nThe number of incidents involving children is particularly\r\nappalling.\r\nWe know, to cite only one example, that in Cambodia\r\n200 to 300 men, women and children are torn apart by\r\nmines every month. For those who lose an arm, a leg or\r\ntheir sight, for those who are otherwise severely wounded by\r\nthe explosion of one of the 4 million to 7 million mines still\r\nremaining in Cambodia, peace has not yet arrived. They\r\nmay never be able fully to enjoy the results of peace in their\r\ncountry. Statistics on the number of mines in various\r\nregions are horrifying: 9 million to 10 million in\r\nAfghanistan; 9 million in Angola; 5 million to 10 million in\r\nIraq; 5 million in Kuwait; 1 million to 2 million in Western\r\nSahara; 1 million to 2 million in Mozambique; 1 million in\r\nSomalia; and 1 million in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe letter (A/48/490) dated 8 October 1993 from the\r\nPermanent Representative of Croatia addressed to the\r\nSecretary-General reminds us that the problem of land mines\r\nalso affects countries in central Europe. It states that there\r\nare some 3 million mines in Croatia. It is clear that the\r\ncountry’s reconstruction will be greatly slowed by this\r\nunresolved problem.\r\nIn our opinion, the international community should\r\nmake every effort to strengthen cooperation to deal more\r\neffectively with the problem of land mines. In this context,\r\nthe Foreign Ministry and the Defence Ministry of the\r\nRepublic of Austria supported a symposium organized last\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 15\r\nMay by an Austrian concern on the subject of mine\r\nclearance as it relates to the challenge of repatriation and\r\nrehabilitation. The symposium brought together military and\r\ncivilian experts on mine clearance, political analysts and\r\nrepresentatives of relevant international organizations and\r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nIn their conclusions, the participants emphasized the\r\nimportance of mine clearance for the success of all\r\nrepatriation and rehabilitation programmes. They also\r\nemphasized that mine-clearance activities require careful\r\npreparation and training and that medical supplies for those\r\ninvolved should be given the highest priority. The\r\nparticipants also noted the imperative need to accompany\r\nmine clearance operations with education programmes for\r\nthe local population. The symposium recommended the\r\nestablishment of a central repository for information and\r\ntechnical databases.\r\nWe thank Mr. Jan Eliasson, Under-Secretary-General\r\nfor Humanitarian Affairs, for having so often emphasized the\r\nurgency of the problem of land mines. We welcome the\r\nestablishment within the Secretariat of a coordinated\r\nmine-clearance programme, with the participation of the\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs, the Department of\r\nPeace-keeping Operations and other competent bodies. We\r\nnote with satisfaction the inclusion in the mandate of several\r\npeace-keeping operations of provisions relating to mine\r\nclearance. We are following very closely the efforts made\r\nby the International Committee of the Red Cross concerning\r\nthe problem of land mines.\r\nThe international community explicitly recognized the\r\nhorrendous nature of land-mines by concluding the\r\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of\r\nCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to\r\nBe Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects,\r\nand in particular the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions\r\non the Use of Mines, Booby Traps and Other Devices\r\n(Protocol II). Austria has ratified the Convention and the\r\nProtocol. We urge all countries that have not yet ratified the\r\nConvention to accede to it as soon as possible.\r\nWe believe also that the possibility of a moratorium on\r\nthe export of land-mines should be carefully considered.\r\nIn this context, we have noted with interest the\r\nconvening by the Secretary-General of a review conference\r\nto amend the aforementioned Convention and in particular\r\nits Protocol II. In our view, it would be a good idea to view\r\nthis review conference as a forum for obtaining greater\r\nadherence. It would also provide an opportunity to build on\r\nexisting legal norms in order to find more effective solutions\r\nto the problem of the indiscriminate use of land-mines,\r\nwhich are mutilating men, women and children all over the\r\nglobe.\r\nThose were the comments the Austrian delegation\r\nwished to make at this stage of our deliberations.\r\nMr. INDERFURTH (United States of America):\r\nUncleared land-mines are a major source of human tragedy\r\nas well as of regional instability. The United States\r\nGovernment estimates that there are more than 85 million\r\nuncleared land-mines scattered in 62 countries throughout the\r\nworld. The number is growing each day. Approximately\r\n150 people - most of them civilians - are killed or injured\r\neach week by land-mines. Land-mines are also a regional\r\ndestabilizing force. They hinder economic reconstruction\r\nand development, inhibit the return of refugees and create a\r\nsource of chaos in countries striving for political stability.\r\nThe United States urges the world community to turn\r\nits attention to this problem now. It must be addressed from\r\ntwo sides. First, we need to remove or neutralize those\r\nmines already laid. Secondly, we must cut the flow of new\r\nmines. The United States Government is pleased to\r\nco-sponsor this draft resolution, which invites Member States\r\nand non-governmental organizations to provide de-mining\r\nassistance, and which asks the Secretary-General to consider\r\nestablishing a voluntary fund for training and other activities\r\nrelated to de-mining.\r\nWe also note that, in addition to this draft resolution\r\naddressing mine removal, two draft resolutions relating to\r\nland-mines are being submitted in the First Committee. This\r\nyear the United States plans to submit a draft resolution that\r\ncalls for a world-wide moratorium on the export of\r\nanti-personnel land-mines - those which pose a grave danger\r\nto civilian populations. In addition, we expect that the\r\nannual resolution on the conventional weapons Convention\r\nwill include a paragraph calling for a review conference to\r\nconsider, among other things, aspects of the Convention\r\nrelating to anti-personnel land-mines.\r\nLast year the United States Government began a\r\nunilateral moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-\r\nmines. The United States Senate recently passed\r\nunanimously a three-year extension of that moratorium. We\r\nexpect the House of Representatives to vote on that issue\r\nshortly. We urge all Member States to join my Government\r\nin support of these efforts to rid the world of land-mines,\r\nboth by regulating their export and by developing de-mining\r\nassistance and training programmes around the world.\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMr. MARUYAMA (Japan): I should like first of all to\r\nexpress my Government’s appreciation to the countries\r\nmembers of the European Community for taking the lead in\r\npromoting the inclusion on the agenda of this new item,\r\n\"Assistance in mine clearance\", which is certain to help draw\r\nthe attention of the world to a most pressing problem.\r\nIt has been said that the indiscriminate maiming of\r\ninnocent people by land-mines left undetonated and\r\nunretrieved after a period of civil conflict is an affront to the\r\ninternational conscience. Many tens of millions of mines are\r\nthought to remain scattered around countries that have been\r\nthe scene of such conflict, and they are taking a toll in\r\nhuman life. They continue to be a major impediment to the\r\nsmooth delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need\r\neven after hostilities cease. Not only do they represent a\r\nconstant threat to the lives of civilians: they also hamper the\r\nrepatriation of refugees and resettlement of displaced\r\npersons, thus affecting activities at all stages, from relief to\r\ndevelopment, of the process by which a country strives to\r\nrestore itself to health after a conflict comes to an end.\r\nIn \"An Agenda for Peace\" the Secretary-General\r\naddresses the problem of land-mines and their terrible\r\nconsequences, emphasizing the urgency of mine clearance\r\nfor any nation setting off on the road to peace and\r\nreconstruction. At its last session, the General Assembly\r\nadopted without a vote resolution 47/120 B, which endorses\r\nas useful the proposals he made in this area. My\r\nGovernment fully subscribes to those proposals and\r\nconsiders that de-mining efforts should also be emphasized\r\nin the terms of reference of peace-keeping operations.\r\nIn his annual Report on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/48/1), the Secretary-General also stated that the United\r\nNations has launched a concerted drive to address this issue\r\nby mobilizing the competent organs of the system. Mine-\r\nclearing operations are already in place in Afghanistan and\r\nCambodia, and in such countries as Angola, Somalia and the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, where they are part of peace-keeping and\r\nhumanitarian efforts. My Government is very much\r\nencouraged by the report of the Secretary-General and the\r\nspecific steps he has taken.\r\nFor its part, Japan has contributed to de-mining\r\noperations in Somalia and Afghanistan by extending\r\n$0.2 million and $14 million, respectively. This is indeed a\r\nmatter of grave humanitarian concern to my country.\r\nSpeaking for the European Community, the\r\nrepresentative of Belgium has urged that a more\r\ncomprehensive programme of action for mine clearance be\r\nestablished under United Nations auspices, especially in light\r\nof the difficulties such operations have experienced in\r\nAfghanistan, Cambodia and Mozambique. Mine-clearing is\r\na labor-intensive and long-term undertaking, which requires\r\nample resources, good planning and technical know-how to\r\nensure the desired outcome. The principal responsibility for\r\nmine clearance rests with the country in whose territory the\r\nmines are located, but a concerted effort on the part of the\r\ninternational community to support these operations is also\r\nessential.\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.5 contains several valid\r\narguments and constructive proposals, particularly those\r\nunderlining the importance of United Nations led\r\ncoordination of mine-clearance activities and the need to\r\nimprove the effectiveness of activities in the field. It is my\r\nGovernment’s view that, while the priority accorded mine\r\nclearance may change over time, and with it responsibility\r\nfor a given operation, effectiveness and cost-efficiency must\r\nbe maintained. To this end, my Government requests the\r\nSecretary-General to prepare a comprehensive report that\r\nwill put this broad subject in perspective for us and provide\r\ncommon ground for a coherent programme.\r\nJapan supports this draft resolution, proposed by the\r\nmember countries of the European Community, and joins\r\nthem in sponsoring it.\r\nMr. KOROMA (Sierra Leone): When the Foreign\r\nSecretary of my country addressed this Assembly last month,\r\nhe expressed the strong concern of the Sierra Leone\r\ndelegation over the proliferation in the use of mines and\r\nother such explosive devices in areas of conflict, especially\r\nin intra-State conflicts.\r\nAgainst the background of the Liberian conflict, we in\r\nSierra Leone have been victims on two fronts: first, having\r\nto cope with the spill-over effects of that conflict; and,\r\nsecondly, dealing with a war imposed on us by one of the\r\nfactions in the conflict for allowing our country to be used\r\nas a base for the peace-keeping operation in Liberia, one of\r\nwhose main features has been the killing and maiming of\r\ncivilians and the disruption of meaningful socio-economic\r\nactivity through the planting of land-mines. Those weapons,\r\nplanted in a primitive and imprecise manner, have proved\r\ndeadly for our citizens, and those who have survived have\r\nbeen left in appalling conditions. Unexploded mines have\r\nmade the task of post-war reconstruction complicated and all\r\nthe more difficult for my country.\r\nIndeed, to quote the Secretary-General in his report to\r\nthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly on the\r\nwork of the Organization:\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 17\r\n\"Of all the tasks involved in setting a nation on a new\r\nroad to peace and prosperity, perhaps none has the\r\nimmediate urgency of mine clearance\". (A/48/1,\r\npara. 459)\r\nAnd he went on:\r\n\"no attempt to restore a sense of community and\r\nsecurity can succeed without effective land-mine\r\nremoval\". (ibid.)\r\nThe Secretary-General’s comments could not be more\r\ntrue. The grim statistics - which in many instances are at\r\nbest inaccurate assumptions - paint an alarming picture, one\r\nin which the increased use of these anti-personnel devices\r\nhas serious consequences far beyond their military\r\nobjectives. They now claim as victims more civilian\r\nnon-combatants on all continents. Recent figures showing\r\napproximately 50 million land-mines in 10 countries around\r\nthe world are, in our view, conservative and do not take into\r\naccount fully their use in situations of conflict of a\r\nnon-international character. Sierra Leone wishes to take note\r\nof the establishment of a coordinated mine-clearance\r\nprogramme within the Secretariat which, we hope, will serve\r\nas a clearing-house for training and technical facilities for\r\nMember States in this area.\r\nFor societies like mine, whose economies are already\r\nweakened, this activity imposes an unacceptably high strain\r\non medical facilities which are already inadequate. The\r\nindiscriminate and very often unrecorded planting of land-\r\nmines in areas of generally high economic potential - such\r\nas farming, grazing and mining areas - ensures that the\r\npost-conflict resumption of economic activity and commerce\r\nis hindered considerably. The consequences of this are\r\nobvious. That is why we believe that the initiative of the\r\nEuropean Community to inscribe this item on assistance in\r\nmine clearance on this session’s agenda could not have been\r\nmore timely. It thus brings to the attention of the\r\ninternational community the need to take concrete steps in\r\ndealing with this scourge, which the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross has described as an active menace used to\r\nterrorize populations with the goal of denying access to land.\r\nMy delegation sees draft resolution A/48/L.5, which we\r\nhave co-sponsored, as a first step in encouraging a\r\ncoordinated approach on the part of the United Nations to\r\nthe issue of mine clearance, especially through the provision\r\nof resources, training, technical assistance and the\r\nestablishment of humanitarian, social and economic\r\nprogrammes to enable Member States so afflicted to embark\r\non mine clearance and to rehabilitate the victims for their\r\nreintegration into society.\r\nBeyond that, however, there must, in our view, be\r\nunequivocal action by the international community to outlaw\r\nthe production, sale and use of these devices which, by their\r\nindiscriminate spreading of death and severe maiming, have\r\nno place in civilized society.\r\nSierra Leone therefore fully supports the draft\r\nresolution and looks forward to the appropriate follow-up\r\naction on it.\r\nMr. KAMAL (Pakistan): The consideration of the issue\r\nof mine clearance by the General Assembly is a welcome\r\ndevelopment. The problems posed by the indiscriminate\r\nlaying of millions of mines in many parts of the world are\r\nnow of such great magnitude that they can only be resolved\r\nby the concerted action of the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe techniques of mine-laying as well as the nature of\r\nland-mines themselves have undergone changes which have\r\nhad the most horrendous consequences. Mines are no longer\r\ndeployed in localized areas as tactical battlefield weapons.\r\nInstead, they are carpeted over vast stretches of land, the\r\napparent objective being to strike terror among civilians and\r\nto empty territory. Many of the most tragic victims of such\r\nmines are children who are maimed for the rest of their\r\nlives.\r\nThe question arises as to what course of action should\r\nbe adopted by the world community. We are of the view\r\nthat a series of steps should be taken in three areas:\r\nmeasures to impart training and know-how to affected\r\ncountries; measures to improve mine-clearance technology;\r\nand, finally, measures to strengthen the legal norms\r\nregarding the use of mines.\r\nMost of the countries that are affected by the problem\r\nof uncleared minefields lack the expertise to clear and\r\nneutralize unexploded mines. The United Nations agencies\r\nand the Member States can be of immense help by setting\r\nup institutional mechanisms for the exchange of information\r\nand know-how, as well in the training of personnel in mine-\r\nclearance techniques. In this regard, we greatly appreciate\r\nthe measures taken by the European Community to\r\nstrengthen the mine-clearing capabilities of affected\r\ncountries.\r\nAs regards technology, attention needs to be given to\r\ntwo separate aspects. Studies should be conducted with a\r\nview to evolving more efficient and modern techniques for\r\nclearing mines and unexploded devices from large areas.\r\nPresent mine-clearing tools, which have been described by\r\nscientists as \"glorified farm implements\", are clearly\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ninadequate for the task. Secondly, there is a need to\r\nconsider the desirability of ensuring that all mines have\r\nbuilt-in mechanisms for rendering them inactive after a\r\ncertain period.\r\nIt is necessary, also, to take steps to strengthen the legal\r\nsanctions against the indiscriminate use of land mines.\r\nStricter rules should be formulated to compel armies to\r\nrecord the locations of mines so that they can be removed\r\nafter the cessation of hostilities. Carpet mining, the\r\ndropping of mines from aeroplanes and other methods of\r\nscattering mines indiscriminately must be prohibited. Also,\r\na ban on the use of mines that have a disproportionate effect\r\non the civilian population, especially anti-personnel mines,\r\nneeds to be considered.\r\nThere is, furthermore, a need for inflicting penalties on\r\nthe parties responsible for the indiscriminate use of land\r\nmines. The principle of \"abuser pays\" is relevant in this\r\ncontext and should be applied forcefully. Those who sow\r\nthe mines should be made to reap the consequences of\r\npaying for their removal and destruction. It is also our view\r\nthat the affected parties should not be asked to bear the\r\nimmense and prolonged costs of rehabilitating a maimed and\r\ninjured populace. Rather, the costs should be borne by the\r\ncountries that resort to such inhuman forms of warfare.\r\nWe are of the opinion that these legal measures can be\r\nconsidered in a review Conference of the 1980 Convention\r\nprohibiting the use of inhuman weapons - especially Protocol\r\nII of this Convention regarding the use of mines, booby traps\r\nand other devices. We, of course, support the moves being\r\nmade to convene such a conference in the near future. We\r\nalso pay a tribute to the work being done by the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross on this subject.\r\nPakistan will continue to take a keen interest in this\r\nissue. As Member States are well aware, we ourselves are\r\naffected seriously by the fallout from the land-mine warfare\r\nconducted by the Soviet Army against Afghanistan. Our\r\nmedical resources have been stretched thin in an effort to\r\ntreat and rehabilitate the thousands of Afghans who have\r\nbeen crippled by mines. We continue to host, even today,\r\na million and a half Afghan refugees, who, quite\r\nunderstandably, are not in a position to return to their mine-\r\nstrewn homeland. All efforts for the reconstruction and\r\nrebuilding of Afghanistan, and for the resettlement of its\r\npeople, are bound to fail until the problem of mine-clearance\r\nis addressed and resolved. Pakistan is committed to\r\ncontributing all that it can to the resolution of this problem.\r\nWe expect the international community’s active assistance in\r\nthis task.\r\nMr. VILCHEZ ASHER (Nicaragua) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): On behalf of the Central American countries,\r\nI wish to emphasize the particular importance our countries\r\nattach to this item, which was introduced so generously by\r\nthe members of the European Community.\r\nIt is estimated that at the present time there are more\r\nthan 100 million land-mines scattered in more than 60\r\ncountries. The seriousness and the cruelty of the\r\nindiscriminate use of mines without any type of controls or\r\nany appropriate registry of their location, as recommended\r\nby international law, have not respected any border. In areas\r\nreaching from Afghanistan to Cambodia and Ethiopia, in\r\nKuwait, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Peru and the former\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, to mention just a few examples, the\r\nspectre of human suffering is enormous, encompassing\r\nthousands of persons killed or maimed and damage to the\r\nnational infrastructure. Especially cruel is the odious\r\npractice of disguising these lethal weapons as toys, thus\r\nendangering the lives of the most innocent.\r\nIn the case of Nicaragua, for instance, it is estimated\r\nthat some 160,000 mines resulting from the conflict of the\r\npast decade have not yet been located. A similar situation\r\nprevails in other countries of Central America.\r\nAccording to statistics of the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross, 23 per cent of those killed by mine\r\nexplosions in Afghanistan and Cambodia were children. In\r\nKabul, 50 per cent were women and children. In Somalia,\r\n74.6 per cent of the victims of mines were children between\r\nthe ages of 5 and 15. Given this serious situation, the\r\nUnited Nations and the various human rights groups and\r\ninternational organizations have alerted the international\r\ncommunity to the devastating effects of the use of mines,\r\nsince these are used not only for military purposes but also\r\nwith the objective of breaking down the operational capacity\r\nand the morale of the enemy, affecting mainly the\r\ndefenceless civilian population.\r\nThe political, economic and social crisis in Central\r\nAmerica, which reached a high point in the 1980s, impeded\r\ndevelopment in the countries of the region, worsened the\r\npoverty levels, intensified the arms race, and resulted in\r\n300,000 deaths and 2 million refugees and displaced persons.\r\nAll of this had a direct impact on hundreds of Central\r\nAmerican families because of the violence, which was the\r\ncommon denominator of the crisis.\r\nThe number of victims of war in Nicaragua alone\r\namounts to more than 100,000, of whom 16,000 persons are\r\nincapacitated, many of them as a result of mine explosions.\r\nMost of these are young people, women and children, for\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 19\r\nwhose sake the Government has undertaken various\r\ninitiatives and is making great efforts to generate\r\nemployment or produce benefits. Our countries, which for\r\nmore than a decade have suffered the effects of war, can on\r\nthe basis of their own experience bear witness to the tragic\r\nsituation confronting any country with broad geographical\r\nregions that have been mined.\r\nAs far as mine clearance is concerned, Nicaragua has\r\nthus far enjoyed the cooperation of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, the Inter-American Defense Board and that\r\nof friendly countries. We have concluded the preparatory,\r\npreliminary stage of mine-clearing and have trained officials\r\nand members of the army of our country in mine\r\ndestruction. This project is being duly implemented, thus\r\nremoving the danger from areas that are needed for\r\nagriculture and for livestock. None the less, further efforts\r\nare necessary.\r\nResolution 47/56, on the Convention on Prohibitions or\r\nRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons\r\nWhich May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to\r\nHave Indiscriminate Effects, and in particular on the\r\nProtocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines,\r\nis of particular importance for our countries. We ought in\r\nfuture to avoid completely the use of mines, and in this way\r\nremove serious obstacles which prolong the effects of war\r\neven in times of peace.\r\nIn this connection, it is of great importance to our\r\ncountries that peace-keeping operations include in their\r\nmandate, once peace has been achieved, the destruction of\r\narms as well as the removal of mines, which in most cases\r\ncontinue to cause the loss of innocent human lives even after\r\nthe achievement of peace. The Central American countries\r\nsupport the proposal made by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277): in the chapter on\r\npost-conflict peace-building, he underscores the importance\r\nof removing mines from those countries that are victims of\r\nconflict because of the harmful effects of the presence of\r\nmines and other unexploded devices.\r\nIn Central America, the presence of mines and other\r\nexplosive devices has claimed many victims. Not only are\r\ntheir effects a risk to the civilian population but they also\r\nsignificantly hinder the recovery and reconstruction of the\r\neconomy and the establishment of normalcy in civilian\r\nsociety.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that of all the\r\ntasks involved in setting a nation on a new road to peace and\r\nprosperity, perhaps none has the immediate urgency of mine\r\nclearance, and that no attempt to restore a sense of\r\ncommunity and security can succeed without effective land-\r\nmine removal. For the Central American countries, this is\r\na task that cannot be put off.\r\nWe are convinced that in all countries that are victims\r\nof armed conflicts the main responsibility for mine clearance\r\nfalls to the State where the mines were laid. But we must\r\ntake into account the enormous, priority tasks facing countries -\r\nmost of them developing countries - that, like Nicaragua,\r\nhave been devastated by the effects of war; after long years\r\nof conflict, they have to make great efforts to achieve\r\nreconciliation and economic and social development, and\r\nthey do not have the necessary technical and financial\r\nresources to carry out complete mine clearance.\r\nIt has been estimated that it will be several decades\r\nbefore the millions of mines can be cleared;\r\nMr. Jan Eliasson, the Under-Secretary-General for\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, has said that the experts estimate that\r\nit may take 40 or 50 years for the spectre of minefields to be\r\nlaid to rest. Therefore, we think it both urgent and timely\r\nfor the Assembly to adopt the draft resolution (A/48/L.5) on\r\nassistance in mine clearance. Our delegations are in\r\ncomplete agreement over both the meaning and the scope of\r\nthis document.\r\nOf particular importance is the establishment of a\r\nvoluntary trust fund to support information and training\r\nprogrammes relating to mine clearance activities. Our\r\ndelegations nevertheless consider that the work still to be\r\ndone is very complex, and that it is therefore vital for the\r\nUnited Nations, with the support of the international\r\ncommunity, to expand its mine clearance assistance\r\nprogrammes.\r\nAccordingly, the United Nations must give priority to\r\nensuring humanitarian assistance and transit for refugees,\r\ntightening up coordination between the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs and peace-keeping operations and\r\nthoroughly considering various ways to enhance resources\r\nfor programmes that fund mine clearance. It should also\r\ngather information and collate work on researching and\r\nanalysing the existing legal instruments, with a view to\r\nadapting them to the new international realities.\r\nMr. AYALA LASSO (Ecuador) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The delegation of Ecuador welcomes the initiative\r\nof the States members of the European Community and by\r\nthe Nordic countries in proposing to the Assembly, in draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.5, that a series of actions should be taken\r\nby the international community to deal with the serious\r\nproblem of the mines that have been laid in various parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nBodies within the United Nations system, and many\r\nothers, both intergovernmental and private, have been taking\r\nmeasures to cooperate with States facing the tragic situation\r\ncaused by the matter which we are now discussing. If the\r\ndraft resolution is adopted, we are convinced that those\r\nefforts can be coordinated properly and that the valuable\r\nexperience of States and other entities involved can be put,\r\nin a flexible, timely and effective manner, at the service of\r\nthose who need it most.\r\nThe figures speak for themselves. Estimates of the\r\nnumber of mines to be cleared range from 100 million to\r\n200 million, scattered all over the world: Afghanistan,\r\nGuatemala, Cambodia, Mozambique, Laos, Somalia and\r\nelsewhere. This is a menace to the civilian population in\r\nmany regions. However, statistics about the victims are\r\nscarce. Suffice it to say that for every survivor there are\r\ntwo deaths. Of the survivors, about three out of four require\r\namputations. In the affected countries, two people per\r\nthousand have been hurt by these devices, and in some\r\ncountries - Somalia, for example - over 70 per cent of the\r\nwounded are children under 15.\r\nJust a few minutes ago, the representative of Nicaragua\r\nreminded us of the statements in this connection by\r\nNicaragua’s Foreign Minister, who speaks of the huge task\r\nit will be to get rid of 160,000 mines in 800 different places,\r\nof which some 200 are unknown. According to official\r\naccounts, Nicaragua has one mine for every 30 people.\r\nEcuador, faithful to its humanist and humanitarian\r\nprinciples, cannot remain indifferent in the face of this\r\nterrifying situation, and has therefore decided to support the\r\ndraft resolution, as we consider it a step in the right\r\ndirection. However, we believe that in preparing the report,\r\nrequested in paragraph 5, on the feasibility of establishing a\r\nfund to finance mine clearance programmes, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral should take into account the special responsibility of\r\nthe countries that produce and export such devices.\r\nAccording to a report by the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross, one State alone has an annual turnover of\r\n$168 million in cluster mine systems, including\r\nanti-personnel components. The opportunities opening up on\r\nthe international markets for these new mine systems are\r\nprompting many companies to invest in developing new\r\ntechnologies, which are not only boosting profits in one\r\nsector of the arms market, but are also improving the mines\r\nto prevent their removal and destruction.\r\nAlthough this is a subject that will be dealt with in due\r\ncourse by the First Committee, which is responsible for\r\ndisarmament matters, I believe that when financial\r\nmechanisms for mine clearance are being worked out those\r\nthat benefit financially from selling mines should shoulder\r\ntheir responsibility and contribute to financing programmes\r\nto eliminate this menace to the civilian population. Taking\r\na small margin from their profits would make it possible to\r\ncarry out this humanitarian task, and would have two\r\nadvantages: for one thing, it would avoid having to impose\r\na further burden of contributions on countries that are\r\nincreasingly reluctant to allocate funds for international\r\ncooperation; for another, it would point clearly to where\r\nlegal responsibility - not only the moral responsibility - for\r\nthis universal problem lies.\r\nSimilarly, in drafting the report requested in the draft\r\nresolution, the Secretary-General will have to take into\r\naccount the specific obligations, under the Protocol on\r\nProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby\r\nTraps and Other Devices, of States that have laid mines.\r\nWe therefore urge Member States to take these\r\nconsiderations into account when they draft their responses\r\nto the Secretary-General, and we request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to design and propose appropriate mechanisms for\r\nputting those suggestions into practice, in an effective\r\nmanner, in implementation of the draft resolution, which we\r\nare convinced will be adopted overwhelmingly today.\r\nMr. NOBILO (Croatia): I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession and to compliment you on your achievements thus\r\nfar.\r\nI should also like to commend the European\r\nCommunity for undertaking the valuable initiative of having\r\nthe item \"Assistance in mine clearance\" included on the\r\nAgenda. This item is of far-reaching importance to post-war\r\nreconstruction and peace-building measures in troubled areas\r\naround the world.\r\nFrom Cambodia and Afghanistan to Mozambique and\r\nCroatia, 150 precious human lives are lost each week, not at\r\nthe hands of ruthless snipers or the impact of intentionally\r\nfired mortars, but because of well-camouflaged land-mines.\r\nThe United Nations Secretariat estimates that 62 countries\r\nare infested with nearly 100 million land mines. The\r\nRepublic of Croatia is one of those countries. At present in\r\nCroatia 300,000 hectares of land have been seeded with\r\nnearly 3 million mines and 1 million hectares contain\r\nvarious kinds of other explosive devices.\r\nThe minefields on Croatian territory are not only\r\nseriously jeopardizing the security of the people living in the\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 21\r\narea; mines are also inflicting a heavy burden on the\r\nCroatian economy. Therefore, my Government has been\r\nforced to undertake a programme to free its land of\r\nexplosive devices. Unfortunately this task is very hard to\r\ncarry out, especially since we have limited resources and\r\ninsufficient equipment. Furthermore, Croatia has witnessed\r\nthe passage of two harvest cycles which have left massive\r\namounts of foliage and ground vegetation, impairing normal\r\nvisibility, which can be vital to detection. These\r\ncomplications on the ground also create optimal conditions\r\nfor accidental detonation, further threatening the lives of\r\ncivilians and specially trained mine-clearing personnel.\r\nCroatia, facing as it does economic hardships, and\r\nconsidering the great financial and technological\r\nrequirements for a programme of land-mine clearance, is\r\nincapable of solving the problem singlehandedly, although it\r\nis trying to extract from its own programme the maximum\r\nbenefits possible. At present the Croatian Government is\r\naccommodating 270,000 displaced persons and well over\r\n280,000 refugees from the neighbouring Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina. In addition to funding humanitarian\r\nassistance for half a million people, Croatia is struggling\r\nwith heavy economic losses and industrial decay as a result\r\nof devastating Serbian aggression. The presence of land\r\nmines has caused an annual loss of $230 million in the\r\nagricultural sector alone and an additional $70 million has\r\nbeen lost in forestry and hunting. Because of these\r\nconditions, 330,000 hectares of land sits unworked.\r\nA comprehensive international programme for\r\nassistance in mine clearance is an important step in the\r\noverall process of the reconstruction of countries in the\r\npost-conflict phase. In applying the mine-clearing\r\nprogramme to each country, specific circumstances must be\r\nreconsidered, and not only from the geographical or\r\ntechnical point of view. For Croatia such a programme\r\nwould ease economic recovery and the reinstatement of a\r\nsecure and normal living environment, facilitate the return of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons, alleviate transportation and\r\ncommunication barriers, safeguard civilians and United\r\nNations personnel and facilitate the reintegration of the\r\nUnited Nations protected areas into the Republic of Croatia.\r\nMines pose a continuous threat to the lives and security\r\nof United Nations personnel serving in peace-keeping\r\nmissions. They restrict the movement of United Nations\r\nforces, whether they are delivering humanitarian aid or\r\nkeeping the peace in hostile areas. This is an additional, but\r\nimportant, reason why the question of \"Assistance in mine\r\nclearance\" must have its place on the United Nations agenda.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia co-sponsored the draft\r\nresolution before the General Assembly, in the sincere hope\r\nthat the results of our discussion today will soon be visible\r\nin the areas which at present, because of mines, have been\r\nturned into \"killing fields\".\r\nMr. KEATING (New Zealand): Land mines are an\r\ninsidious scourge. They are killing and maiming people,\r\nparticularly civilians, in Asia, Africa, Latin America and\r\nEurope.\r\nNew Zealand joins earlier speakers in expressing deep\r\nconcern about the devastating effects that randomly laid,\r\nuncharted and uncleared land mines are having on civilians\r\nin countries such as Cambodia, Mozambique and the former\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nIn addition to their devastating impact on individuals\r\nwho come in contact with them, land mines have very\r\nharmful social and economic effects. Uncleared land mines\r\nlaid in fields, forests and watercourses prevent the growing\r\nof food and crops, the raising of livestock and the\r\nrehabilitation of land. These weapons are denying civilians\r\nin war-ravaged areas the right to social and economic\r\nrecovery.\r\nThe United Nations’s peace-keeping operations are also\r\naffected, and in some cases threatened, by land mines which\r\njeopardize the safety of peace-keeping personnel.\r\nNew Zealand fully supports the call for a\r\ncomprehensive programme of assistance with mine\r\nclearance. For us, this is not merely an item of theoretical\r\ninterest. New Zealand peace-keepers have witnessed the\r\ndevastating effects of land mines during numerous United\r\nNations operations in countries such as Afghanistan and the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, and have themselves suffered casualties\r\nfrom these weapons. New Zealand has contributed over the\r\nyears to the mine-clearance training programme in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nDe-mining is also an important part of New Zealand’s\r\ncontribution to United Nations efforts to rehabilitate parts of\r\nCambodia. New Zealand personnel are working with other\r\npeace-keepers involved in the United Nations Transitional\r\nAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC) process to establish the\r\nCambodian Mine Action Centre. The Centre controls\r\nde-mining operations, mine awareness and education\r\nprogrammes in Cambodia, and it is expected that the\r\nCambodian Government will soon take over the operation.\r\nControls on the use of land mines are few. The only\r\nspecific multilateral agreement controlling the use of land\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nmines is Protocol II of what is commonly known as the\r\ninhumane weapons Convention.\r\nThe Convention itself is a significant document, but\r\nStates parties need to address some serious weaknesses\r\nwhich limit its effectiveness, particularly in regard to\r\nProtocol II. For example, while it calls for the clearance of\r\nland mines after a conflict ends, no verification mechanism\r\nexists for ensuring compliance. Also, in cases where\r\nnon-compliance is clear, the Convention lacks any\r\nenforcement provisions. New Zealand therefore supports the\r\ncall for a review conference which will seek to strengthen\r\nthe Convention by considering these issues. Such a\r\nconference should concentrate with the utmost urgency on\r\nthe issue of land mines and make effective controls on these\r\nweapons its first priority.\r\nIn order to make plain our abhorrence of the effects of\r\nland mines and to become fully engaged in the review\r\nconference process, New Zealand has ratified the\r\nConvention. We urge others to do the same. We note that\r\nit seems likely that the review conference will be held in\r\n1995, which should give signatories plenty of opportunity to\r\nratify.\r\nIn the meantime, until the review gets under way, we\r\nwould encourage dialogue on land-mines issues between\r\ninterested States, and we support proposals to establish a\r\ngroup of experts to facilitate discussions in the run-up to the\r\nconference.\r\nThe use of land-mines by States is not the only\r\nproblem. A further issue of concern is that land-mines have\r\nin recent times been used in conflicts not only by States but\r\nalso by groups that are not able to be represented at the\r\nUnited Nations negotiating table. Some type of effective\r\ncontrol must also be put on the use of land-mines by groups\r\nthat could not become a party to any convention.\r\nSuch an issue can be addressed by examining the trade\r\nin land-mines and adopting measures to limit or prevent their\r\nsupply. In this context, New Zealand acknowledges the\r\nunilateral actions of the United States and France in placing\r\nmoratoriums on the transfer of land mines.\r\nNew Zealand considers the random, widespread use of\r\nland-mines and the effect they are having on civilians to be\r\na problem of the gravest concern. We must work together\r\nto foster controls on the use of these weapons.\r\nNew Zealand is already working with other countries\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, and we shall\r\ncontinue to provide what assistance we can on practical\r\nmine clearance when that is needed.\r\nNew Zealand therefore wholeheartedly supports the\r\npresent draft resolution, which seeks to encourage, organize\r\nand coordinate national, regional and global assistance on\r\nmine clearance.\r\nMr. PIBULSONGGRAM (Thailand): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the opportunity to participate in these deliberations\r\non the new and important agenda item on mine clearance.\r\nWe have heard many delegations stress the importance of\r\nthis issue, in regard to which a draft resolution is before us.\r\nIn his report on the work of the Organization, which we\r\nconsidered just last week, the Secretary-General stressed the\r\nimportance of mine-clearing. He stated that\r\n\"Of all the tasks involved in setting a nation on a\r\nnew road to peace and prosperity, perhaps none has the\r\nimmediate urgency of mine clearance\". (A/48/1,\r\npara. 459)\r\nIn his report he mentions the situation in Afghanistan,\r\nAngola, Cambodia, Mozambique, Somalia and the former\r\nYugoslavia, saying:\r\n\"Tens of millions of mines have been left in areas of\r\nconflict\". (ibid.)\r\nThe presence of mines is a major obstacle to human\r\nresettlement, the restoration of transport infrastructure and,\r\nindeed, socio-economic recovery. The Secretary-General\r\nconcluded that no attempt to restore a sense of community\r\nand security can succeed without effective land-mine\r\nremoval.\r\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General’s launching of\r\na coordinated programme of action on mine clearance\r\ninvolving the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, the\r\nDepartment of Peace-keeping Operations and other\r\ncompetent bodies.\r\nThe Secretary-General has reported that in Afghanistan\r\nat least 10 million mines were left behind after the recent\r\nwar. These remaining uncleared mines continue to hinder\r\nseriously the restoration of normal life in many parts of that\r\ncountry. The Secretary-General also mentions in his report\r\nthe successful use of mine-detecting dogs. Thailand is proud\r\nto have participated in this effort. Mine-detecting dog teams\r\nfrom the Royal Thai Army were involved not only in the\r\nactual mine clearance but also in the training of local\r\nmine-clearing dog teams.\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 23\r\nIn Cambodia, where the country is entering a new\r\nphase of national reconciliation and rehabilitation following\r\nthe successful holding of general elections and the\r\nestablishment of a new Government, a number of\r\nchallenging obstacles and problems remain to be overcome.\r\nOf high priority is the question of the resettlement of\r\nthousands of displaced persons and demobilized soldiers.\r\nThese people, Cambodia’s most valuable human assets,\r\nshould be able to return to their villages, lead their lives in\r\nnormalcy and thus contribute to the strengthening of the\r\ncountry’s economy. Unfortunately, resettlement has proved\r\ndifficult, since a large part of Cambodia was mined during\r\nthe decade-long armed conflict. According to the\r\nSecretary-General, approximately 5 million mines are spread\r\nall over the eastern districts. For this very reason, we view\r\nde-mining as one of the essential prerequisites in\r\nCambodia’s reconstruction process. Failure to carry this out\r\nwould jeopardize thousands of lives and put the safety of the\r\ninternational personnel involved in humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment assistance in constant danger.\r\nIt has also been said that the war in Cambodia may\r\nhave been the first in history in which more people were\r\nkilled by mines than by any other type of armament. Even\r\nnow the people of Cambodia are still, tragically, dying or\r\nlosing their limbs at the rate of 200 to 300 a month because\r\nof some 4 million land-mines left behind. Sadly, such a\r\nsituation exists not only in Cambodia but also in Angola,\r\nAfghanistan, Mozambique and elsewhere. My delegation\r\ntherefore joins in urging the international community not to\r\nbe oblivious to the importance of the issue of mine-clearance\r\nand to assist these countries in an endeavour which, taking\r\ninto account the millions of mines involved, may last for\r\ndecades.\r\nOn its part, Thailand has dispatched two engineering\r\nbattalions to Cambodia to assist in mine clearance and\r\nhighway rehabilitation - one battalion as part of the United\r\nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) and\r\nthe other as part of our bilateral assistance to Cambodia - in\r\naddition to other forms of bilateral assistance in human-\r\nresources development. I do not wish to overstate\r\nThailand’s contribution; yet, however token it may seem, it\r\nclearly demonstrates our willingness to lend assistance where\r\npossible and whenever required. Indeed, Thailand is\r\nprepared to continue rendering the necessary assistance, as\r\nwe have done in the past, be it in the area of infrastructure\r\ndevelopment or in human-resources development.\r\nMy delegation wishes to congratulate Belgium and the\r\nEuropean Community, the original sponsors of this important\r\nand timely item, for bringing it to the attention of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We support the draft resolution before\r\nus, and have joined in sponsoring it. We look forward to\r\nthe Secretary-General’s comprehensive report, which he has\r\nbeen requested to submit prior to the forty-ninth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. We are also of the view that the\r\npossibility of establishing a voluntary trust fund for mine\r\nclearance should be explored.\r\nMy delegation joins in expressing the hope that the\r\ndraft resolution before us will enjoy the widest possible\r\nsupport.\r\nPrince SISOWATH SIRIRATH (Cambodia): First of\r\nall, my delegation would like to express sincere thanks to the\r\nEuropean Community and various other friendly countries\r\nfor taking the initiative of introducing draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.5, entitled \"Assistance in mine clearance\",\r\nunder agenda item 155.\r\nCambodia has supposedly closed a 21-year chapter of\r\nthe horrors of war, but the Cambodian people continue to\r\nsuffer a relentless series of man-made disasters from the\r\nmassive number of land-mines that were planted all over our\r\ncountry’s fields during the war. Today, as a cease-fire takes\r\neffect thanks to the Paris Peace Agreement of\r\n23 October 1991, and as peace once again reigns in the\r\ncountry, thousands of mines are still found along footpaths,\r\nin rice paddies and riverbeds and around villages and\r\nhamlets.\r\nThe people of my country refer to land-mines as\r\n\"eternal sentinels\" which never sleep and are always ready\r\nto strike. Unless these mines are cleared and destroyed, they\r\nwill continue to kill innocent civilians well into the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Unlike bombs or artillery shells, which are\r\nspecially designed to explode when they approach or hit\r\ntheir target, land-mines lie dormant until a person, a vehicle\r\nor an animal triggers their firing mechanism. These\r\nland-mines are blind weapons that cannot distinguish\r\nbetween a soldier and a civilian. They recognize no peace\r\ntreaty or cease-fire. They will continue to exist long after\r\nthe war is over; they will maim or kill the children and\r\ngrandchildren of the soldiers who laid them.\r\nIn war or in peace, military personnel injured by\r\nland-mines stand a better chance of receiving prompt\r\nmedical care than civilians. As we all know, foot soldiers\r\nusually travel in groups and carry first-aid and\r\ncommunication equipment. They can always radio their\r\nmilitary bases or camps for help. On the other hand, few,\r\nif any, civilians caught in or near war zones have access to\r\nrapid-evacuation facilities. The civilians most likely to\r\nencounter land-mines are the rural poor who live far from\r\ntowns or cities and who have access to no proper medical\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nfacilities. The poor peasants looking for wood and food or\r\ntilling their fields are particularly at risk. Children herding\r\nlivestock are likewise extremely vulnerable. And,\r\nsometimes, children attracted by the unfamiliar and unaware\r\nof the hazard, play with mines, which they think are toys,\r\nwith devastating results.\r\nEven when civilians injured by land-mines reach\r\nmedical facilities, they often fail to receive proper care\r\nbecause X-ray film, anaesthetics, surgical equipment and\r\nantibiotics are unavailable or in short supply. In general, the\r\nvictims of land-mines are more likely to require amputations\r\nthan victims wounded by other munitions.\r\nJust last week, my Government, under the premiership\r\nof His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Ranariddh and\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hun Sen, addressed a letter to the\r\nSecretary-General on the critical problem of land-mines in\r\nCambodia. They said that the mine problem in Cambodia at\r\npresent is horrendous and is a major barrier to growth,\r\ndevelopment and safety. Mines kill or maim more than\r\n300 Cambodians a month; they deny access to land on which\r\nto grow food and resettle displaced persons; they place a\r\ntremendous burden on an already limited infrastructure; and\r\nthey deny Cambodians their basic right to a safe\r\nenvironment.\r\nCambodia, with a population of over 9 million, already\r\nhas the highest percentage of physically disabled inhabitants\r\nof any country in the world. There are now over\r\n40,000 amputees in Cambodia as a result of injury from\r\nmines. Most of the casualties have been civilian peasants\r\nwho stepped on mines while gathering firewood, harvesting\r\nrice, herding animals or fishing. Nearly as many have died\r\nfrom loss of blood, undiscovered in the fields, or have\r\nsuccumbed to their wounds because no transport was\r\navailable to get them to medical help.\r\nMost amputees, when cured, leave hospital with little\r\nhope for the future. Cambodia is an agrarian country and\r\nneeds the muscle power of every able-bodied citizen for its\r\nsurvival. Our agriculture is very labour-intensive and\r\nrequires the participation of everyone. A person who is\r\nphysically disabled can become a burden to the family,\r\nbecoming someone who eats but does not produce anything.\r\nI am saddened to report to the Assembly that after 21 years\r\nof war and suffering Cambodia still has no rehabilitation\r\ncentres and no laws that can protect disabled persons against\r\ndiscrimination or exploitation.\r\nBut in the new Constitution promulgated by His\r\nMajesty Norodom Sihanouk, King of Cambodia, on\r\n24 September 1993, the Royal Cambodian Government has\r\nset as a priority the creation of rehabilitation centres for\r\ndisabled persons to help them adjust to their new life and\r\nprevent them from becoming beggars or petty criminals.\r\nMany amputees, unable to find work, nowadays drift to the\r\ncapital city of Phnom Penh or to other large towns and\r\nbecome a burden to the Government and an unpleasant sight\r\nfor visitors and Cambodians alike.\r\nMy delegation knows that the problem of land mines is\r\nnot a problem in Cambodia alone, but that the same situation\r\nis found also in Afghanistan, Angola, Lebanon, Somalia, and\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, countries which have been so\r\ndevastated by long conflicts and wars.\r\nMy delegation is deeply grateful to the\r\nnon-governmental organizations, such as Cambodia Trust of\r\nGreat Britain, the Indochina Project and many others, and in\r\nparticular to Handicap International, the Belgian-based\r\nhumanitarian organization that has 13 prosthetics workshops\r\nthroughout Cambodia; these organizations have helped in the\r\nrehabilitation of disabled Cambodians, victims of land-mines.\r\nMy delegation wishes to bring to the attention of the\r\nrepresentatives here the problem of land-mines which lie\r\nscattered throughout Cambodia, and requests the ongoing\r\nhelp and cooperation of the international community to\r\nremove as many of them as possible.\r\nThe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia\r\nwill officially end its duty in Cambodia on\r\n15 November 1993. The international staff will have left\r\nCambodia by then, and no advisers will be available to assist\r\nthe Cambodians with safety, technical matters, logistics,\r\ncommunications and finances and to liaison with the United\r\nNations Cambodia Mine Action Centre’s de-mining trust\r\nfund. De-mining operations so far as we know, will no\r\nlonger function as of 1 November 1993.\r\nUnited Nations assistance is required immediately if a\r\ntimely remedy is to be found. Bilateral solutions have been\r\nproposed and investigated, but that process will take months;\r\nthe Cambodia Mine Action Centre will wither and a major\r\neffort will be required to start it again.\r\nA solution to the problem of land-mines in Cambodia\r\nis required urgently. It appears that the only solution for\r\ncontinuing the de-mining is an extension of remaining\r\ninternational staff at the Cambodia Mine Action Centre for\r\na period of 60 days while all issues are resolved.\r\nThe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia\r\nhas accomplished so much by setting up the Cambodian\r\nMine Action Centre, and it would make no sense to allow it\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 25\r\nto close for lack of a small international advisory group.\r\nThe Cambodian Mine Action Centre has so far cleared over\r\n3,800,000 square meters of mine fields. This dangerous task\r\nrequires a sizeable budget for special equipment for the next\r\nfive to ten years. My delegation hopes that the international\r\ncommunity can help make Cambodia safe for present and\r\nfuture generations.\r\nGiven the importance attached by many concerned\r\ncountries to this critical issue, my delegation urges the\r\nsupport of the international community in obtaining their\r\nhelp and cooperation. My delegation is also fully aware of\r\nthe significant participation by the international community\r\nin responding to the problem of land-mines in Cambodia,\r\nand we are profoundly grateful to those who have reacted in\r\nan extremely positive manner and indicated their willingness\r\nto continue helping Cambodia recover from this terrible\r\nnightmare.\r\nIt is in this context that my delegation is pleased to\r\nco-sponsor draft resolution A/48/L.5, entitled \"Assistance in\r\nmine clearance\", under agenda item 155.\r\nMr. ELHOUDERI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): The areas which at one time\r\nor another were theatres of military operations and in whose\r\nsoil large numbers of land-mines were planted have\r\ncontinued to be a grave source of fear and anxiety. On the\r\none hand, this existence of land-mines continues to impede\r\neconomic development and obstruct every effort to limit\r\ndegradation of the environment. For a long time now, the\r\nGeneral Assembly has been demonstrating its awareness of\r\nthe devastating effects of land-mines by adopting numerous\r\nresolutions on the issue, the latest being resolution 40/197.\r\nIn those resolutions, the Assembly highlighted the dangers\r\nresulting from the presence of the material remnants of war,\r\nespecially land-mines, because of loss of life, destruction of\r\nproperty and grave obstruction of efforts aimed at land\r\nreclamation and reconstruction.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\" (A/47/277), accorded considerable attention to the\r\nproblem of land-mines. He emphasized the urgent need for\r\nde-mining because of the danger land-mines pose to people’s\r\nlives and the adverse effects they have on economic activity\r\nespecially in the areas of reviving agriculture and road\r\nbuilding. In discussing \"An Agenda for Peace\" in the forty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly, my delegation\r\nthanked the Secretary-General for dealing with this problem,\r\nand particularly for his emphasis on the need to address the\r\ngrave problem of land-mines which remain scattered in\r\nmany areas of past hostilities as is the case with regard to\r\nmy country which was one of the theatres of military\r\noperations in the Second World War. Large numbers of\r\nland-mines were planted in our soil during that war. Mine\r\nexplosions have resulted in the loss of thousands of lives and\r\nthe continued presence of minefields still obstructs our\r\nefforts to combat drought and desertification and hampers\r\nour attempts to promote land reclamation.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the fact that the General\r\nAssembly has agreed to inscribe an item on the agenda of\r\nthis session entitled \"Assistance in mine clearance\". By the\r\nsame token, my delegation welcomes the draft resolution\r\nunder this item which is contained in document A/48/L.5 as\r\nthe contents of the draft address some of our concerns,\r\nparticularly in its reference to paragraph 58 of \"An Agenda\r\nfor Peace\", which deals with the problems arising from\r\nland-mines in present or former combat zones. We had\r\nhoped for a clear explicit reference to this problem in the\r\ndraft resolution. By the same token, we believe that the\r\ndraft resolution should have taken into consideration some\r\nof the other aspects of the problem of land-mines by calling\r\nupon the States responsible for planting those land-mines to\r\nsubmit all the necessary information and technical assistance\r\nrequired in mine clearance activities as well as payment of\r\ncompensation for the damage caused to States in whose soil\r\nland mines were planted as was previously called for in the\r\nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly and other\r\nbodies and organizations, such as the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme.\r\nWhile expressing its position vis-à-vis the problem of\r\nland mines and how to deal with their collateral effects, our\r\ndelegation hopes that the resolution to be adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in this regard will contribute to solving\r\nthis problem. In this connection, my delegation wishes to\r\nemphasize in particular the contents of operative paragraph\r\n6 of the draft resolution, which urges all Member States to\r\nextend full assistance and cooperation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in this respect and to provide him with any\r\ninformation and data which would be useful in drawing up\r\nthe report he will submit to the next session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMs. TREIMANIS (Latvia): I am speaking on behalf of\r\nEstonia, Lithuania and my own country, Latvia.\r\nWe welcome the initiative of the European community\r\nin proposing the inclusion of the item entitled \"Assistance in\r\nmine clearance\" in the agenda of the General Assembly. We\r\nshould like to emphasize that mine clearance is a necessary\r\ncomponent of peace-building, since it assists in establishing\r\nthe conditions for lasting peace in areas of conflict and\r\ntension. We share the concern about the serious\r\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nhumanitarian, social, economic and ecological destruction\r\nwhich can and will be caused by the failure to remove\r\nmines, as well as the harm caused by remaining minefields\r\nto the civilian population and peace-keeping missions in\r\ncountries stricken by armed conflict. Assistance in mine\r\nclearance is of crucial importance to these countries, as they\r\nlack the necessary resources to clear the huge minefields left\r\nby armed conflict. This matter is not the business of the\r\naffected countries alone, but a subject of concern for all\r\nStates, as the security of every region is in the interest of\r\neach and every member of the world community. We\r\nbelieve that the work in mine clearing should be pursued on\r\nthe basis of a programme of the United Nations and in\r\ncooperation with regional organizations. Such a programme\r\nwould provide the necessary assistance to launch the\r\nclearance operations as well as provide relevant information\r\nand training programmes to all countries.\r\nIt is appropriate to point out that this assistance be\r\nprovided not only to countries that have recently experienced\r\ncivil strife and war but also to countries that are undergoing\r\nthe transition caused by recent major political changes. The\r\nBaltic States are facing this problem as part of the\r\nconsequence of the illegal presence of the foreign military\r\nforces on their sovereign soil. Those forces have abused our\r\nsoil and are leaving behind considerable acreage with large\r\nnumbers of unexploded devices. There are also numerous\r\nammunition depots which need clearance.\r\nThere are many sites in the Baltic States which are\r\nextremely dangerous. In Latvia there are more than 42,000\r\nhectares of territory that need clearance and that contain an\r\nestimated 24,000 unexploded devices. It would take Latvia,\r\nwith its limited technical knowledge and personnel resources,\r\n30 years to clear these sites. Many of the depots and\r\narmaments date back to the Second World War. The lack\r\nof necessary technical and personnel resources to carry out\r\nsuccessfully the clearance of sites creates a potential danger\r\nfor the civilian population and prohibits the recovery of any\r\nland for peaceful agricultural purposes.\r\nWe are co-sponsoring the draft resolution, \"Assistance\r\nin mine clearance\", guided by the conviction that the\r\nsuccessful implementation of the text to be adopted will\r\ncontribute to the promotion of peace and security in the\r\nworld, save lives and help promote a speedier recovery of\r\nthe affected lands for peaceful purposes.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item. The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/48/L.5.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.5?\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.5 was adopted\r\n(resolution 48/7).\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nCuba, who wishes to explain his delegation’s position. May\r\nI recall that such explanations are limited to 10 minutes and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. RIVERO (Cuba) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMy delegation wishes to explain its position on draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.5, which was submitted under agenda item\r\n155 by the delegations of the European Economic\r\nCommunity and others, and which is entitled \"Assistance in\r\nmine clearance.\"\r\nMy delegation associates itself with those delegations\r\nthat have expressed concern about the effects of the\r\nexistence of minefields on the civilian population in\r\ncountries that have experienced armed conflicts, and it\r\nassociates itself with the need to proceed to clear such areas.\r\nIn light of those considerations Cuba participated actively in\r\nthe Conference held under United Nations auspices in the\r\nearly 1980s, which resulted in the Convention on\r\nProhibitions or Restrictions of Use of Certain Conventional\r\nWeapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively\r\nInjurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and its three\r\nProtocols, one of which deals specifically with mines.\r\nIn addition, my delegation recognizes that the need for\r\nmine-clearing operations has taken on greater urgency in\r\nrecent years owing to conflicts that have taken place\r\nrecently, and that various actions have been taken by\r\ninternational and non-governmental organizations in this\r\nregard. None the less, although my delegation has joined in\r\nthe consensus on the draft resolution because it shares the\r\nhumanitarian spirit that inspires it, we do wish to place on\r\nrecord a few considerations of a political and technical\r\nnature that we view as important.\r\nFirst, the question of mine clearance is one of the\r\nsubjects considered in the Secretary-General’s report, \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace,\" and on which negotiations have been\r\nheld and certain decisions reached. My delegation feels it is\r\ninappropriate to extract specific matters from the body of\r\nsubjects and proposals in \"An Agenda for Peace\" on which\r\ndecisions have been taken, since such a practice may lead to\r\na proliferation of resolutions that could seriously complicate\r\nour work and lead to possible confusion.\r\n32nd meeting - Tuesday, 19 October l993 27\r\nSecondly, any consideration of the conduct of mine-\r\nclearing activities should take place within the framework of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/120 B, which, as has been\r\nrecalled, stresses that post-conflict peace-building activities\r\ncan only be undertaken once the conflicts have been ended,\r\nand must be agreed upon by the parties or carried out on the\r\nbasis of agreements ending conflicts.\r\nThirdly, there is a balanced reference in the draft\r\nresolution to the serious threat that mines and other\r\nunexploded devices constitute to the safety, the health and\r\nthe lives of personnel participating in humanitarian, peace-\r\nkeeping and rehabilitation operations, as well as among\r\ncivilian populations.\r\nFourthly, the terms of the consideration requested from\r\nthe Secretary-General of the financial aspects of activities\r\nrelated to mine clearance are very ambiguous. My\r\ndelegation is of the view that such activities should be\r\nfinanced by a voluntary trust fund and that consideration\r\nshould also be given - as the delegation of Ecuador has\r\npointed out - to financing of such activities by the countries\r\nthat produce and export mines. In any event, information\r\nand training programmes and mine-clearing activities in\r\ngeneral should be totally financed by such a fund.\r\nFifthly, the draft resolution tends to establish a\r\nmechanism that we view as parallel to the mechanism\r\nprovided for in Article 9 of the Protocol on Prohibitions or\r\nRestrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby Traps and Other\r\nDevices to the 1980 Convention to which I referred earlier,\r\nwhich includes the modalities for international cooperation\r\nin mine-clearance. Article 8 of that Protocol refers to the\r\nprotection of United Nations forces or missions from the\r\neffects of minefields.\r\nLastly, we consider it somewhat contradictory that\r\ntoday, when efforts are being made to achieve what has been\r\ncalled the rationalization of our work, this draft resolution,\r\nwhich refers basically to mines, is being submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly when we are aware that two additional\r\ndraft resolutions dealing with mines will also be submitted\r\nto the First Committee, one aimed at establishing a\r\nmoratorium on the export of antipersonnel mines and the\r\nother aimed at convening a review conference on the 1980\r\nConvention with a view to possible\r\nmodifications with regard to mines. My delegation believes\r\nthat this matter should have been considered in an integrated\r\nway in a single forum, namely, the First Committee, in a\r\ntext that could have dealt with the question in all its aspects.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Since no other delegation wishes\r\nto speak, may I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 155?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.40 p.m.\r\n"
