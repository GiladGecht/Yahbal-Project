The 18\r\noutgoing members are: Argentina, Austria, Botswana, Chile,\r\nFrance, Germany, Guinea, Japan, Malaysia, Morocco, Peru,\r\nSomalia, Spain, the Syrian Arab Republic, Togo, Trinidad\r\nand Tobago, Turkey and Yugoslavia.\r\nI should like to remind members of the Assembly that,\r\nas of 1 January 1994, the following States will continue to\r\nbe represented on the Economic and Social Council:\r\nAngola, Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium,\r\nBenin, Bhutan, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Cuba,\r\nDenmark, Ethiopia, Gabon, India, Italy, Kuwait, the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya, Madagascar, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, the\r\nPhilippines, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the\r\nRussian Federation, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Swaziland,\r\nUkraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\nIreland, the United States of America and Zaire.\r\nThe names of those 36 States should therefore not\r\nappear on the ballot.\r\nAccording to paragraph 4 of General Assembly\r\nresolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking\r\ninto account the number of States which will remain\r\nmembers of the Council after 1 January 1994, the 18\r\nmembers should be elected as follows: five from African\r\nStates; three from Asian States; one from Eastern European\r\nStates; four from Latin American and Caribbean States; and\r\nfive from Western European and other States. The ballot\r\npapers reflect that pattern.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the\r\ncandidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled,\r\nreceiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds\r\nmajority of those present and voting will be declared elected.\r\nIn the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be\r\na restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have\r\nobtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that\r\nprocedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: In accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot,\r\nand there shall be no nominations.\r\nI shall now call upon representatives who wish to make\r\nstatements before we proceed to the election.\r\nMr. GHAFOORZAI (Afghanistan): Membership of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council is important, mainly for the\r\nfollowing two reasons. First, contributing to the activities of\r\ndifferent organs of the Organization is part of the collective\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86927 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.33\r\n9 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nand Charter responsibilities of each Member State, in order\r\nto employ international machinery for the promotion of the\r\neconomic and social advancement of all people. Secondly,\r\nit is through membership of such organs that a Member\r\nState can bring to the attention of the relevant Department\r\nin the United Nations system its particular needs relating to\r\nthe promotion of social and economic programmes and a\r\nbetter standard of life for its people.\r\nAfghanistan, after 14 years of foreign domination and\r\noccupation, is once again taking its place in this international\r\nforum and is trying to participate actively in the activities of\r\nthe Organization. We consider that to be our Charter\r\nobligation.\r\nWith regard to our particular problems and needs at this\r\nvery critical stage of our life as a war-stricken country, we\r\nwant to bring to the attention of the relevant organs of the\r\nOrganization, including the Economic and Social Council,\r\nthe particular needs of the Afghan nation, whose destruction\r\nin the past 14 years of war may not have a parallel in\r\nhistory. In addition to losing 1.5 million of its population,\r\nour country has lost its total economic infrastructure and is\r\nfaced with enormous economic, social, cultural, educational,\r\nhealth and other multifaceted problems that have been left us\r\nas a legacy of the former Soviet Union’s aggression against\r\nour homeland.\r\nMoreover, to ensure a balance in the representation of\r\ninterest groups in the Economic and Social Council,\r\nAfghanistan concluded that membership of the Council\r\nwould appropriately ensure representation of the least\r\ndeveloped and land-locked developing countries.\r\nFor these reasons, we submitted our candidature for\r\nmembership of the Economic and Social Council. However,\r\nit was not convenient for the Group of Asian States to be\r\nunable to arrive at an agreed slate and accordingly for there\r\nto be contesting candidates. The delegation of the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan, in a spirit of accommodation and to\r\nfacilitate the process of election of the Asian candidates for\r\nmembership of the Economic and Social Council, has\r\ndecided to withdraw this year. It is our earnest expectation\r\nthat Member States will give favourable consideration to\r\nAfghanistan’s renewed candidature for 1995-1996.\r\nMr. SHAHEED (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): Notwithstanding the generous support for our\r\ncandidature to membership on the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, which we deeply appreciate, my delegation should\r\nlike to announce that it does not insist on its candidature for\r\nthis year and that it wishes to postpone it till next year out\r\nof a desire to maintain the unity of the Group of Asian\r\nStates and in response to the kind efforts exerted by the\r\nAsian Group’s Chairman to arrive at a list of candidatures\r\nthat agrees with the slate for the Group.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on the representative of\r\nZimbabwe, as Chairman of the Group of African States.\r\nMr. MUMBENGEGWI (Zimbabwe): My Head of\r\nState, President Robert Gabriel Mugabe, has already\r\nexpressed our pleasure at seeing you, Sir, preside over the\r\naffairs of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nAllow me, nevertheless, the honour and privilege, as\r\nChairman of the Group of African States for the month of\r\nOctober, to reiterate his sentiments.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council offers one of the best\r\nforums for constructive international dialogue and\r\ncooperation on the economic and social issues affecting our\r\nregions and peoples. The violent upheavals and conflicts\r\nthat bedevil nations and regions are often to a large extent\r\nmanifestations of more deeply embedded economic and\r\nsocial maladies. Thus, the interrelationship between peace\r\nand socio-economic well-being cannot be overemphasized.\r\nIt is our hope that the awaited report from the\r\nSecretary-General on an agenda for development will give\r\nthe necessary impetus to the promotion of international\r\ncooperation for social and economic advancement. The\r\nAfrican Group is ready to participate fully and constructively\r\nto that end in the General Assembly and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\nIt therefore gives me great pleasure to present the\r\ncandidatures of Egypt, Ghana, Senegal, the United Republic\r\nof Tanzania and Zimbabwe for election to the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. All these countries have been fully endorsed\r\nby the African Group. On behalf of the Group, I commend\r\nthose five countries to the General Assembly for its\r\nconsideration.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call upon the representative\r\nof Indonesia, as Chairman of the Group of Asian States.\r\nMr. WISNUMURTI (Indonesia): As Chairman of the\r\nAsian Group for the month of October 1993, having heard\r\nthe statements of the representatives of Afghanistan and the\r\nSyrian Arab Republic, I should like to inform the Assembly\r\nthat the following countries have decided to withdraw their\r\ncandidatures: Afghanistan, the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, the Syrian Arab Republic and the United\r\nArab Emirates.\r\n33rd meeting - Thursday, 21 October 1993 3\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that, despite the\r\ngracious gestures of the countries I have just mentioned, the\r\nAsian Group, regrettably, could not achieve an agreed slate.\r\nThe declared candidates from the Asian Group in the\r\nelections to the Economic and Social Council for the period\r\n1994-1996 are therefore as follows: Indonesia, Japan,\r\nKazakhstan, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nthe Russian Federation, as Chairman of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States.\r\nMr. VORONTSOV (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): As Chairman of the Eastern European\r\nGroup, I should like to inform the Assembly that the Group\r\nhas endorsed the candidacy of Bulgaria for membership of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council, in the post to be filled by\r\nour Group. We are convinced that Bulgaria’s participation\r\nwill enhance the practical effects of the work of the Council,\r\nwhich will be undertaking major tasks resulting from the\r\nnew geopolitical and economic realities.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nCuba, as Chairman of the Group of Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States.\r\nMr. ZAMORA (Cuba) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe Latin American and Caribbean Group has always\r\nattached great importance to the work of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. As Chairman of the Group for the month of\r\nOctober, I have the honour to inform the Assembly that for\r\nthe four positions to be filled from our region the Group has\r\nendorsed the candidacies of Chile, Costa Rica, Paraguay and\r\nVenezuela.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nNew Zealand, as Chairman of the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and Other States.\r\nMr. KEATING (New Zealand): I am very pleased, on\r\nbehalf of the Group of Western European and Other States,\r\nto advise the General Assembly that for the five positions to\r\nbe filled from our area on the Economic and Social Council\r\nfor the period beginning 1 January 1994 there are five\r\ncandidatures: France, Germany, Greece, Ireland and\r\nPortugal. These candidates have been fully endorsed by the\r\nGroup.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: In accordance with the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall proceed now to the election by secret\r\nballot, taking into account the statements made by the\r\nrepresentatives of Afghanistan, the Syrian Arab Republic,\r\nZimbabwe, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, Cuba and\r\nNew Zealand.\r\nBallot papers marked A, B, C, D and E will now be\r\ndistributed. I request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers and to write on them the names of the States for\r\nwhich they wish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the relevant\r\nregion than the number of seats assigned to it will be\r\ndeclared invalid. Should they appear on a ballot paper,\r\nnames of Member States which do not belong to that region\r\nwill not be counted at all.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Yahya (Brunei\r\nDarussalam), Mrs. Valle Camino (Cuba), Mr. Silis\r\n(Latvia), Ms. Iiyambo (Namibia) and Ms. Nicolaisen\r\n(Norway) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 12.10 p.m.\r\nMrs. Frechette (Canada), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A - African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 171\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 171\r\nAbstentions: 2\r\nNumber of Members voting: 169\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 113\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nEgypt 167\r\nGhana 166\r\nZimbabwe 166\r\nSenegal 165\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania 165\r\nZambia 1\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nGroup B - Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 171\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 171\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of Members voting: 171\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 114\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nJapan 149\r\nIndonesia 129\r\nPakistan 97\r\nKazakhstan 63\r\nPapua New Guinea 59\r\nGroup C - Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 171\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 2\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 169\r\nAbstentions: 8\r\nNumber of Members voting: 161\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 108\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBulgaria 161\r\nGroup D - Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 171\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 171\r\nAbstentions: 3\r\nNumber of Members voting: 168\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 112\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nVenezuela 166\r\nChile 164\r\nParaguay 158\r\nCosta Rica 155\r\nEcuador 1\r\nUruguay 1\r\nGroup E - Western European and Other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 171\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 171\r\nAbstentions: 2\r\nNumber of Members voting: 169\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 113\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nIreland 164\r\nFrance 161\r\nPortugal 160\r\nGreece 159\r\nGermany 156\r\nMalta 6\r\nNew Zealand 2\r\nSpain 1\r\nSweden 1\r\nThe following States, having obtained the required\r\ntwo-thirds majority, were elected members of the Economic\r\nand Social Council for a period of three years beginning\r\non 1 January 1994: Bulgaria, Chile, Costa Rica, Egypt,\r\nFrance, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Indonesia, Ireland,\r\nJapan, Paraguay, Portugal, Senegal, United Republic of\r\nTanzania, Venezuela, Zimbabwe.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I congratulate the States which\r\nhave been elected members of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil.\r\nSince one seat remains to be filled from among the\r\nAsian States, we shall now proceed to the first restricted\r\nballot.
