This item is new this year, added to the\r\nAssembly’s agenda at the initiative of Liechtenstein. I\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude\r\nto the Members of the United Nations for allowing us in this\r\nway to open up discussion on a matter which we believe to\r\nbe of great potential value in avoiding human suffering and\r\nmaintaining a more peaceful world.\r\nIn previous years we have put forward our ideas and\r\nsuggestions during the course of the general debate. This\r\nwas done first when I had the honour to address the\r\nforty-sixth session of the General Assembly in 1991, during\r\nthe second general debate in which Liechtenstein participated\r\nafter becoming a Member of the United Nations. The\r\nthoughts which I expressed on that occasion were amplified\r\nin the statement made the following year at the forty-seventh\r\nsession by the Head of Government of Liechtenstein,\r\nMr. Hans Brunhart. In those statements we explained the\r\nthinking underlying our suggestions. It is quite simple.\r\nWe see all around us that civil strife within States often\r\ninvolves great suffering and that, even though such strife\r\nmight have its root causes within a State, there is always the\r\ndanger that its impact will soon spread beyond its borders,\r\nthus threatening the security of a whole region or even\r\ninternational security more widely. None of us can sit back\r\nand accept all that with equanimity. But we also notice that\r\ncivil strife is often caused by the social tensions which build\r\nup when distinctive groups within States are not allowed\r\nadequate means through which to express their distinctive\r\nidentity. If we could only find the means whereby such\r\nself-expression could be encouraged, the occasion for civil\r\nstrife, with all its attendant dangers and suffering, could be\r\nmuch reduced and perhaps in some cases avoided altogether.\r\nAnd how much better would it be to put in place some\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86952 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.36\r\n11 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsuitable arrangements before tensions explode into conflict,\r\nrather than waiting until that has already happened and then\r\ntrying to pick up the pieces. The Secretary-General has\r\nreminded us all of the extreme importance of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, as distinct from the more usual reactive\r\ndiplomacy.\r\nAs we see it, the principle of self-determination, as\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and other\r\nimportant international legal instruments, still has unexplored\r\npotential which offers the possibility that progress might be\r\nmade in the directions we seek, and autonomy offers a\r\nparticularly helpful practical device which could be\r\ndeveloped within the broad scope of that principle.\r\nAll this led us to suggest that the international\r\ncommunity should explore the possibility of communities’\r\nhaving a degree of autonomy. This concept is very flexible\r\nand can be used constructively to cover different aspects of\r\nself-determination and thereby tailor the degree of\r\nself-expression enjoyed by communities to whatever is\r\nappropriate in their particular circumstances. We envisage\r\nsome minimal mechanisms and procedures being made\r\navailable to help States and communities in their search for\r\nsuitable models of autonomy which they might find\r\nappropriate to their needs.\r\nThat is the essence of our ideas and of the reasoning\r\nbehind them. Since they were first put before the Assembly\r\nin 1991 we have had the opportunity to listen to the very\r\nconstructive comments of a number of interested States. In\r\nparticular, we have had the benefit of the views expressed at\r\nthe informal meeting of experts which Liechtenstein had the\r\ngreat pleasure and privilege of hosting in Liechtenstein last\r\nMarch. Those comments and views, and our own further\r\nreflections, have enabled us to refine our thinking a little\r\nfurther. Now that we have come to a discussion of our ideas\r\nin the context of this agenda item, it is fitting that I should\r\nelaborate on them further. I should like to begin by drawing\r\nattention to four points which are basic to our suggestions.\r\nFirst, the initial impetus of the principle of\r\nself-determination has been in the field of decolonization.\r\nWhile that process is not yet completed, by far the greatest\r\npart of it has been achieved, and this Assembly can look\r\nwith satisfaction at the role it played. But self-determination\r\nis a principle of continuing value. Without in any way\r\ndiminishing its relevance to situations of colonialism or alien\r\ndomination which may still exist, our proposals look in a\r\ndifferent direction and seek to put renewed emphasis on that\r\nprinciple as a valuable factor in a new context.\r\nSecondly, self-determination is a very broad principle\r\nallowing for many forms of development, including\r\nindependence. Indeed, in the context of decolonization,\r\nindependence was usually the primary goal. In our\r\nperspective, however, independence is not the primary\r\nobjective; it would be wrong to exclude it in principle, but\r\nwe believe that the objective of finding ways of defusing\r\ndangerous tensions - an objective which I am sure is widely\r\nshared - is preferably to be achieved through the concept of\r\nautonomy. This, too, is a flexible concept, but essentially it\r\nis concerned with what may be called \"internal self--\r\ndetermination\". It allows for a degree of self-expression\r\nwhich can be sufficient to reflect a community’s sense of\r\nidentity. It also allows account to be taken of the particular\r\nand diverse circumstances which exist within many States.\r\nIt allows for development over time, as the circumstances\r\nmay warrant. And most important of all, it does not threaten\r\nthe fragmentation of States or the creation of numerous tiny\r\nindependent entities. The value of autonomy as a concept\r\nwhich may prove helpful will be evident to us all from\r\nrecent developments, particularly in the Middle East.\r\nThirdly, our emphasis on autonomy as the concept\r\nwhich offers the most hopeful way forward also underlies\r\nour belief that our concern should be with the position of\r\ndistinctive communities within States. It is the frustrations\r\nof such communities that so often lead to the kind of\r\ntensions, and then conflicts, we wish to avoid.\r\nFourthly, it is our belief that it is not enough just to\r\nexpress the right sentiments: we must add suitable\r\nprovisions that will serve to make the outcome one which\r\nwill prove effective in practice. By this we do not mean the\r\nconstruction of any elaborate and costly organizational\r\nstructure, but we envisage the introduction of simple\r\nmechanisms to ensure that whatever proposals are eventually\r\nagreed upon will be likely to work effectively in practice.\r\nLet me now look a little more closely at some of the\r\nmain elements in our thinking. It will be apparent from\r\nwhat I have already said that our concerns are with the\r\ntensions that arise between communities. \"Community\" is\r\na term which I believe we all generally understand, but\r\nwhich can sometimes be difficult to pin down with legal\r\nprecision. The classic formula often used by the United\r\nNations in some other contexts refers to groups having a\r\nlinguistic, religious, cultural or ethnic basis for their\r\ndistinctive identities. While we do not necessarily suggest\r\nthat that formula should be adopted in the present context,\r\nit does help to identify the sort of lines along which it may\r\nbe helpful to think.\r\n36th meeting - Monday, 25 October 1993 3\r\nI would, however, wish to emphasize that our concept\r\nof a \"community\" is not the same as a \"minority\". Much\r\nvaluable work has, of course, been done on the position of\r\nminorities, both within the United Nations - I refer\r\nparticularly to the Declaration on the Rights of Persons\r\nBelonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic\r\nMinorities, which was adopted last year - and in other\r\nbodies, such as the Conference on Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (CSCE), and most recently in the Council of\r\nEurope at its Summit meeting in Vienna. But although there\r\nmay be some overlap between the ideas of \"community\" and\r\n\"minority\", they are essentially different. The main thrust of\r\nour concerns is with the political and cultural aspirations of\r\ncommunities, which possess, in a way that many minorities\r\ndo not, a degree of territorial and social cohesion.\r\nWe believe that, within the broad principle of\r\nself-determination, such communities should be recognized\r\nas having legitimate aspirations to an appropriate degree of\r\nautonomy, which must be respected and secured. They\r\nshould be enabled, by the exercise of their own free choice,\r\nto give appropriate expression to their own political, social,\r\neconomic and cultural aspirations in accordance with the best\r\ninterests of their members.\r\nThese aims must, we believe, be pursued with\r\nconsiderable flexibility. The circumstances of each\r\ncommunity and of each State differ greatly. Their diversity\r\nmust be taken into account. As we see it, the way forward\r\ncan best be found through acknowledging varying degrees of\r\nautonomy to be enjoyed by communities. The forms of\r\nautonomy allow for very great flexibility; its many elements\r\ncan be combined in a multitude of different ways. But\r\nviewed overall, it is possible to see several broad levels of\r\nautonomy, each of which progressively adds to the degree to\r\nwhich the community conducts its own affairs.\r\nBut, at the same time, out of respect for the territorial\r\nintegrity of States, we do not consider it appropriate to\r\nsuggest that these successive levels of autonomy should\r\nfollow each other by some automatic or mandatory process.\r\nRather, they should be dependent upon the request of the\r\ncommunity concerned and the consent of the State in\r\nquestion, so that progress towards greater autonomy would,\r\nin effect, be through some kind of optional process.\r\nIn our view, the first, very basic, level of autonomy\r\nshould, however, be acknowledged for all communities\r\nhaving a sufficient degree of distinctive identity. This would\r\ncover only some very modest and basic requirements, such\r\nas non-discrimination and freedom for the community to\r\npractise and enjoy its distinctive community characteristics.\r\nIn certain areas of public administration community\r\nmembers should be guaranteed a proper role - for example,\r\nby participating in public affairs through voting in elections\r\nand standing for public office; at the local or national level,\r\nthere should be organs of public administration concerned\r\nwith matters affecting the community’s interests; and the\r\ncommunity should be involved in appropriate ways in the\r\ntaking of governmental decisions affecting its interests.\r\nThe particular circumstances might, of course, indicate\r\nthat something beyond those basic entitlements would be\r\nappropriate. This might be particularly likely with the\r\npassage of time, as a community grows in experience and\r\ndemonstrates its fitness to move on to autonomy in further\r\nareas. These developments would happen on a case-by-case\r\nbasis and would involve a progressive degree of\r\ndecentralization.\r\nBut let me repeat: the acknowledgement of any further\r\ndegree of autonomy beyond the very basic initial level\r\nwould, in our view, be a matter for specific acceptance by\r\nthe State concerned. Indeed, we envisage that at all levels\r\nof autonomy detailed implementing arrangements would\r\nneed to be worked out between the State and the community\r\nconcerned.\r\nWe do not suggest that there should be any hard and\r\nfast prescription of the elements that would comprise\r\nsuccessive levels of autonomy. As I have said, it is of the\r\nessence that the arrangements should be flexible, and hence\r\ncapable of helping in the infinitely variable circumstances\r\nthat are likely to arise. But, by way of illustration, let me\r\nsay that at a relatively early stage the community might be\r\nenabled, through its elected representatives, to administer\r\nfunds allocated for its benefit. The community could make\r\nits own direct contribution to the preservation of order and\r\nthe administration of justice within the State. There could\r\neven be provision for the community to administer schools\r\nin the community’s area, for use by members of the\r\ncommunity.\r\nAt more advanced levels of autonomy a community\r\ncould have various additional rights, such as the right to\r\nestablish a local representative legislature with certain\r\nlimited powers over the community. The community could\r\nalso be accorded certain rights with regard to the\r\nadministration of State functions within the community’s\r\narea, but, of course, excluding matters of foreign affairs or\r\ndefence.\r\nUltimately, and in our view relatively infrequently,\r\nindependence might be appropriate in certain cases where it\r\nis agreed by the State concerned. It would be for the State\r\nand the community to negotiate and agree the details\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nwhereby an orderly transition to independence might be\r\nachieved. It might nevertheless be appropriate, indeed, it\r\nmight be positively helpful to the parties concerned, to draw\r\nattention to certain considerations which would be relevant\r\nin this context - for example, that the community’s system\r\nof government should include safeguards for the proper\r\nobservance of democracy, and that the community should\r\nsubscribe to international human rights commitments.\r\nBut independence is not the primary objective of our\r\ninitiative; we are looking much more at the forms of what\r\nmay be styled internal self-determination than at processes\r\ndesigned to lead to the attainment of independence. As I\r\nhave said, these successive stages of autonomy - after the\r\nfirst - would be optional. In addition, it may prove desirable\r\nto include certain further safeguards for the position of\r\nStates. I have in mind such requirements as that any\r\nprogress by a community from one level of autonomy to the\r\nnext should be dependent upon its having satisfactory\r\nexperience of conducting its affairs at the preceding level,\r\nand that the rights to be enjoyed by a community at the\r\nvarious levels of autonomy would have to be exercised\r\nwithin the constitution and laws of the State.\r\nSome modest and basic forms of assistance should be\r\navailable, through independent procedures, to ensure the\r\neffective operation in practice of this pattern of flexible and\r\ngraduated degrees of autonomy. This might involve three\r\ncomponents.\r\nFirst, there should be a body with responsibility for\r\nensuring that the underlying policy is effectively\r\nimplemented, which could also, if necessary, be responsible\r\nfor regulating any financial aspects of its work.\r\nSecondly, there would need to be some authority\r\ncharged with an active and positive role in the practical\r\noperation of arrangements for the effective realization of the\r\nvarious levels of autonomy. This authority could offer\r\nassistance if there were any difficulties, for example, by way\r\nof good offices or mediation. Perhaps associated with that\r\nauthority’s functions there could be an international research\r\nand advice centre.\r\nThirdly, arrangements would be needed to provide for\r\nthe peaceful resolution of any differences that might arise.\r\nIt is our firm conviction that something along the lines\r\nthat I have outlined would advance, in a very practical way,\r\nthe fundamental principle of self-determination. Developing\r\nthe specific concept of autonomy would open up a further\r\narea in which the right of self-determination could be made\r\nmore effective in practice, without prejudice to all that has\r\nalready been achieved, and still remains to be achieved, in\r\nmore traditional areas. It would also, we believe, contribute\r\nto the avoidance of future conflicts that have their root\r\ncauses in the tensions between communities within States.\r\nRecent events have, tragically, shown us all that this is a\r\nmatter of urgency.\r\nIn my first statement to the General Assembly, at its\r\nforty-sixth session, I said that some scheme such as I have\r\noutlined could eventually be embodied in a convention. I\r\nrealize that this is an ambitious goal, but we believe that it\r\nis a possible way in which, in due course, progress could be\r\nmade.\r\nThat is not, however, our immediate object in bringing\r\nthis topic on to the agenda of the General Assembly. We\r\nrecognize that many aspects of our proposals are technically\r\ndifficult, politically sensitive or both. We are therefore very\r\nanxious to hear the views of the membership of the\r\nOrganization. We have already held in Liechtenstein the\r\ninformal meeting of experts to which I have referred. It was\r\nmost valuable, but, intentionally, the views of the\r\nparticipants were expressed only on a personal, expert basis.\r\nWe hope, therefore, that many delegations will now\r\nparticipate in the discussions in the Third Committee.\r\nWe shall, of course, study with the greatest care\r\nwhatever views are expressed here. While our underlying\r\nconcerns are unlikely to diminish, our thinking about the\r\nways in which those concerns might be met is very flexible.\r\nWe hope that the debate on which we are now embarking\r\nwill enable us to come forward next year with specific\r\nproposals to put before the General Assembly.\r\nConsequently, our immediate aim is simply to open up\r\ndiscussion on the problems we have identified and on our\r\nideas for helping to overcome them. We hope that the\r\nGeneral Assembly will agree to resume consideration of this\r\ntopic at the forty-ninth session, next year. We shall be\r\ncirculating a draft resolution seeking just that - and no\r\nmore - in the course of the coming days.\r\nThe problems that we are trying to address are very\r\nserious, not just for those of our fellow human beings who\r\nare suffering directly from the kind of conflict with which\r\nwe are concerned, but also for all of us. We believe that the\r\ninternational community must do everything it can - take\r\nevery opportunity, explore every possibility - to help\r\nalleviate that suffering. It is as a contribution to that end\r\nthat I have ventured to put before the Assembly ideas that\r\nmight - and we believe will - be helpful, and we look\r\nforward to the debate that will follow.\r\n36th meeting - Monday, 25 October 1993 5\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of State of the\r\nPrincipality of Liechtenstein for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Hans-Adam II of\r\nLiechtenstein was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have concluded this stage of\r\nour consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 108.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 8 (continued)\r\nADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ORGANIZATION\r\nOF WORK: FIFTH REPORT OF THE GENERAL\r\nCOMMITTEE (A/48/250/Add.4)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now draw the attention of\r\nrepresentative to the fifth report of the General Committee,\r\nwhich has been circulated as document A/48/250/Add.4.\r\nThe report concerns the request by a number of\r\ncountries for the inclusion in the agenda of the current\r\nsession of an additional item entitled \"Economic assistance\r\nto States affected by the implementation of the Security\r\nCouncil resolutions imposing sanctions against the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)\".\r\nThe General Committee decided to recommend to the\r\nGeneral Assembly that the item should be included in the\r\nagenda.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to include in\r\nits agenda this additional item?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The General Committee further\r\ndecided to recommend to the Assembly that the item should\r\nbe allocated to the Second Committee.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts this\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Chairman of the Second\r\nCommittee will be informed of the decision just taken.\r\nTENTATIVE PROGRAMME OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to inform members of\r\na change in the programme of work. On Tuesday,\r\n16 November, in the morning the Assembly will consider\r\nagenda item 26, \"Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\".\r\nThis agenda item had originally been scheduled for\r\nconsideration as the first item on Monday, 22 November, in\r\nthe morning.\r\nFurther, I should like to remind representatives that the\r\nPledging Conference for Development Activities will be held\r\non Tuesday, 2 November, and Wednesday, 3 November, in\r\nthe morning. The Conference will be opened by the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nI should also like to inform members that the\r\nannouncement of voluntary contributions to the 1994\r\nprogrammes of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees will take place on Wednesday,\r\n10 November, in the afternoon, and that the announcement\r\nof voluntary contributions to the 1994 programmes of the\r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine\r\nRefugees in the Near East will take place on Friday,\r\n3 December, in the morning.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 22\r\nUNIVERSITY FOR PEACE: DRAFT RESOLUTION\r\n(A/48/L.11)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly has before it draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.11.\r\nI call on the representative of Costa Rica to introduce\r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nMr. TATTENBACH (Costa Rica) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): For many years the delegation of Costa Rica has\r\nspoken on the item \"University for Peace\", as most members\r\nof the General Assembly will be aware. The impression\r\nmay even have been created that Costa Rica has\r\nappropriated - so to speak - the University for Peace for\r\nitself. But that is not the case. It is just that we appreciate\r\nthe University for Peace and have placed great hope in it,\r\nbecause peace is an ideal and a virtue deeply rooted in the\r\nsoul of Costa Rica.\r\nThe University for Peace is an institution of the United\r\nNations, and accordingly does not belong to any one\r\ncountry. This must be fully understood, because it creates\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsituations and establishes commitments that require\r\nacceptance.\r\nMoreover, we must understand that, as has been said\r\nrepeatedly, the way to attain the goal of the University is\r\nand always will be education. That is easy to say, but it\r\nentails a whole series of requirements.\r\nFirst, it is necessary to define what peace is. To say\r\nmerely that peace is not simply the absence of war, or to say\r\nthat another word for peace is development, is to speak the\r\ntruth, but it is an oversimplification of the truth. Our world\r\ntoday is extremely complex, so much so that the end of the\r\nbipolarity that had caused so many tensions resulted not in\r\na reduction of those tensions, but in an inexplicable increase.\r\nIt is inexplicable that people on the brink of famine, instead\r\nof rejoicing when they are offered relief, become\r\nindescribably indignant towards those who bring them food,\r\nor that peoples offered the restoration of democratic life\r\nreject it obstinately. Why? It is because the souls of people\r\nare complicated and must be fully understood, in depth,\r\nbefore action is taken. That is the objective of the\r\nUniversity for Peace. Its mandate is research on and study\r\nof the factors that mould the internal and external relations\r\nof peoples in all their myriad facets, which include law,\r\neconomics, history, sociology, anthropology, health,\r\nstatistics, psychology and even religion, not to mention the\r\nenvironment and climate.\r\nWith all these factors which affect society taken into\r\naccount - and my list may not be complete - there can be a\r\nvalid interdisciplinary analysis to understand what is going\r\non in the world.\r\nObviously, what I have outlined is far from the\r\nromantic, old-fashioned idea of peace. But peace is no\r\nlonger romantic; it is a reality and an extremely complex\r\nneed that must be examined in the light of efficient, modern\r\ncriteria.\r\nWhat I have said so far is more diagnostic than\r\nprescriptive of remedies, because knowing what is going on\r\ndoes not automatically mean that one knows what should be\r\ndone: in this case, who should be educated and how. But\r\ntoday education is, as it has always been, an immense need\r\nof peoples.\r\nI shall always remember the inscription on a monument\r\nin Paris to Danton, which says: \"After bread, the most\r\nimportant need of the individual is education\". And if at the\r\ntime of the French Revolution education was already so\r\nimportant for the individual, today it is important not only\r\nfor the individual, but also for peoples. One of the tasks of\r\nthe University for Peace is to discover who should be\r\neducated for peace - whether leaders, the middle class or the\r\npeople - and how, and at what cost. The immense\r\ncomplexity of using the mass media is a problem in and of\r\nitself requiring a whole chapter.\r\nLastly, we must think about the fact that peace, just like\r\nthe absence of peace, is today a global problem. There can\r\nbe no conception of stable peace in one part of the world\r\nwithout peace elsewhere. It would be like trying to imagine\r\nan infection in one part of the body that has no effect on the\r\nrest of the body. I mention this because I believe that the\r\nefforts to educate for peace should be supported by all the\r\nStates of the international community. That requirement,\r\nfortunately, is being met - but slowly.\r\nIn short, the concept of educating for peace is no longer\r\njust a good intention; it must, rather, be seen as a new, very\r\nmodern and complex discipline that is related to many\r\nexisting disciplines but that, by dint of its particular aim, is\r\ndifferent from all of them. I believe the day is not far off\r\nwhen ministries of peacemaking will replace ministries of\r\ndefence and when there are institutes of higher education for\r\npeace rather than the prestigious, but slowly becoming\r\nobsolete, military academies. With our University for Peace,\r\nwe are making a humble, modest attempt to take a first step\r\nin this endeavour.\r\nI shall now put abstract thoughts aside and report on\r\nthe work of the University for Peace over a period of more\r\nthan a year and a half, since January 1992. That very month\r\nthere was a seminar on family life and education for peace.\r\nAt the end of the month there was a Central American\r\nworkshop on protected border areas. In February 1992 the\r\nUniversity made a presentation before a plenary meeting of\r\nthe Central American Parliament. Also in February 1992 the\r\nDirector-General of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, Mr. Felipe Mayor,\r\nvisited the University. In April 1992 the Regional Institute\r\nof Labour Relations was established. From April to\r\nDecember 1992 an extensive programme on promoting\r\nhuman rights and on education for peace was carried out. In\r\nSeptember 1992 the Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, Mr. Maurice\r\nStrong, came on a formal visit. In October 1992 the United\r\nNations agreed to designate the University’s documentation\r\nand information centre a United Nations depositary library.\r\nIn December 1992 master’s courses in international relations\r\nand in ecology, natural resources and peace were concluded,\r\nhaving benefited a group of students from 32 different\r\ncountries.\r\n36th meeting - Monday, 25 October 1993 7\r\nIn February 1993 the World Meeting of Women was\r\nheld at the University for Peace. The same month the\r\nTeilhard de Chardin Cultural Association was established.\r\nIn March the German theologian Dr. Hans Küng paid a visit.\r\nThe same month a course was given on saving tropical\r\nforests by means of the use of non-wood products and\r\nservices. Also in March the University for Peace gave talks\r\nto the Nicaraguan army. In the same month, Quakers from\r\nthe United States lent their support to the University’s\r\neducational mission. In April the post-graduate specialist\r\ncourse in labour relations and human resources was initiated.\r\nAlso in April, courses were given on the management of\r\nbuffer zones. In May an agreement was signed with the\r\nCentral University of Venezuela and the Latin American\r\nWorkers Centre to\r\n\"make the great Latin American homeland a zone of\r\npeace, founded on democracies that are based on\r\nfreedom and social justice\".\r\nIn June there was an international forestry course. The same\r\nmonth a seminar on information management in crisis and\r\nemergency situations was organized. In July a series of talks\r\nwas given at the National Autonomous University of\r\nNicaragua to deal with the challenge of rebuilding the\r\nNicaraguan political system. In August an agreement was\r\nsigned between the Costa Rican Supreme Court of Justice\r\nand the University. Also in August short courses were\r\ninitiated for the training of indigenous leaders, this being the\r\nInternational Year of the World’s Indigenous People. In\r\nSeptember a course was initiated on the resolution of\r\nconflicts over the management of natural resources. This\r\nmonth a seminar/workshop is being held on economic\r\ndemocracy and civil society: towards a social and labour\r\nconsensus in Guatemala. Finally, on 15 October the first\r\npost-graduate specialist course in labour relations and human\r\nresources was concluded.\r\nAll the attention given these activities and events has\r\nnot detracted from the attention given the seven master’s\r\ncourses running from September 1991 to 1995. These\r\ncourses cover international relations, beginning on\r\n2 September 1991 and ending in June 1993, and natural\r\nresources, ecology and peace, beginning in October 1991 and\r\nending in June 1993. Other such courses will subsequently\r\nbe carried out in social concertation and programming,\r\neducation for peace and human rights. The last four courses\r\nare at present scheduled to begin in 1994.\r\nAs these courses are completed over the next six years\r\nthey will produce about 200 experts in each of the fields of\r\nstudy. Those professionals will be able to serve in their\r\ndifferent fields of knowledge and join various public\r\ninstitutions. In particular, they will be able to provide\r\ntechnical knowledge for the fulfilment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s \"Agenda for Peace\", for the prevention and\r\nresolution of conflicts and for peace-building. These fields\r\nof study can be expanded in the future.\r\nI also wish to tell the Assembly briefly about two\r\nbodies related to the University for Peace: the Gandhi\r\nCentre for Communications and Radio Peace International.\r\nThe Gandhi Centre was created through a programme of\r\ncooperation between the University for Peace and the Italian\r\nGovernment. At present it is responsible for preparing and\r\nsupervising production and programming plans for means of\r\ncommunication used for the training, education and\r\ninformation needed to fulfil the objectives of the University\r\nfor Peace. Its work in the last two years has been highly\r\nsatisfactory.\r\nIn 1987 the University for Peace and the World Peace\r\nUniversity in the State of Oregon, in the United States,\r\njoined forces to establish a means of communication for\r\nworld peace. Thus was the radio station born, as a not-for-\r\nprofit non-governmental organization, with a specific goal:\r\nto inform and educate, and create a culture for peace. It is\r\nfitting to note here that the Committee on Information\r\nrecognized in a report to the General Assembly the\r\nimportant work done by the University for Peace and its\r\nRadio Peace International in the dissemination of\r\ninformation on the work of the United Nations.\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.11, which we are introducing\r\nand which is sponsored by the delegations listed in the\r\ndocument, along with other delegations that will be listed in\r\nan addendum, is almost self-explanatory, as it follows the\r\nlines of the resolution adopted two years ago, the only\r\nalterations being those required by changed circumstances.\r\nWith regard to these changes, the financial contributions\r\nof Spain, Italy, Costa Rica and the Commission of the\r\nEuropean Communities, all of which have been extremely\r\nuseful to the institution, should be acknowledged.\r\nWe also note with satisfaction that Slovenia acceded to\r\nthe International Agreement for the Establishment of the\r\nUniversity for Peace on 6 June 1992. Other States Members\r\nof the United Nations are invited to do likewise and, thereby,\r\nto demonstrate their support for a world institution for peace\r\nstudies. I should make the point that accession to the\r\nInternational Agreement for the Establishment of the\r\nUniversity for Peace does not imply any financial\r\ncommitment whatsoever. Also, it should be remembered\r\nthat the budget of the University for Peace has no\r\nimplications for United Nations expenditure, as, by virtue of\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe expressed will of the States that established the\r\nUniversity, the United Nations does not contribute to its\r\nmaintenance.\r\nLastly, I wish to refer again, with gratitude, to the fact\r\nthat in 1991, under the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the Secretary-General established a Trust Fund\r\nfor Peace, financed through voluntary contributions, to\r\nprovide the University with the necessary means of\r\nextending its field of action to include the rest of the world.\r\nI hope that this draft resolution will receive enthusiastic\r\nsupport and be adopted by consensus, and I wish, in\r\nanticipation, to thank members for supporting it.\r\nMr. FULCI (Italy): Italy has consistently supported the\r\nUniversity for Peace since its foundation by the General\r\nAssembly 13 years ago. As has just been recalled by\r\nAmbassador Tattenbach, the University’s host country is the\r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, whose essential role, in proposing\r\nthe initiative and in making it a reality, we sincerely\r\napplaud.\r\nThe aim of this unique University for post-graduate\r\nstudies is to instil the ideal of peace in the hearts and minds\r\nof the younger generation. It promotes both research and the\r\ndissemination of knowledge, with the specific purpose of\r\ntraining young people to work for peace within the United\r\nNations system. I believe that there is no better explanation\r\nof the University’s mission than article 2 of its Charter:\r\n\"The University is established with a clear\r\ndetermination to provide humanity with an international\r\ninstitution of higher education for peace and with the\r\naim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of\r\nunderstanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to\r\nstimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen\r\nobstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in\r\nkeeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\" (resolution 35/55,\r\nannex to the Agreement)\r\nMr. Soh (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nA special Trust Fund for Peace was designated for the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme to enable the\r\nUniversity for Peace in Costa Rica to flourish and to help in\r\nspreading its message throughout the world.\r\nItaly strongly believes in the principle of the promotion\r\nof peace through education, training and research.\r\nTherefore, my Government has joined in this endeavour,\r\nright from the beginning, with a total financial commitment\r\nof $1.5 million.\r\nThe contributions of Costa Rica, the European\r\nCommunity, Italy and Spain have enabled the University to\r\ninitiate a series of research projects in the area of\r\ninternational relations. The focus of such projects is\r\neducation for peace: the study of methods of the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflicts, the promotion of human rights and\r\nthe production of radio and television programmes. One\r\ncannot underestimate how important these three areas of\r\nconcern are to United Nations activities. The first two relate\r\nto issues that are perpetually on our agenda, and the last\r\nrepresents an essential contribution to the life of the\r\nOrganization, which depends on the support of public\r\nopinion and, therefore, relies heavily on mass\r\ncommunications.\r\nThe implementation of \"An Agenda for Peace\"\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General can benefit, in concrete\r\nterms, from the work of the University for Peace. In fact,\r\nit is our profound conviction that educating individuals in\r\nrespect of the principles on which peace is based is, in the\r\nlong run, the surest way of preventing conflicts and of\r\npromoting the causes of peace, freedom and democracy.\r\nIn expressing again to the Government of Costa Rica\r\nand to its Permanent Mission in New York our\r\ncongratulations on the success already achieved, we are glad\r\nto be a sponsor of draft resolution A/48/L.11 and to\r\nrecommend that the General Assembly adopt it by\r\nconsensus.\r\nMr. ZUÑIGA (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nAs Members of the world Organization know, the University\r\nfor Peace, whose headquarters is in Costa Rica - a country\r\nwhich has close and friendly relations with Chile and which,\r\nin respect of this concept, sets an example to many other\r\ncountries - is an international institution devoted to the\r\nsearch for peace through education with humanistic\r\nobjectives, in accordance with the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights.\r\nThese goals, like the work carried out by the\r\nUniversity, have the full support of the Government of\r\nChile. The principles that led to the establishment of this\r\ninstitution could not have been more visionary. In the\r\ncurrent international situation, in which, fortunately,\r\nconfrontation has been replaced with cooperation and\r\nunderstanding between nations, the University’s principles\r\nare more relevant than ever. Accordingly, Chile resolutely\r\n36th meeting - Monday, 25 October 1993 9\r\nsupports the work of the University and, for that reason, is\r\na sponsor of the draft resolution on this subject.\r\nGenerally speaking, the University for Peace, as a\r\nprimary source of thought, research and study, faces a major\r\nchallenge. This challenge is a result of the great cultural\r\nchanges, the interrelationships and the profound\r\ntransformations in global society. The University for Peace\r\ncannot avoid this reality. Its intellectual tasks today must\r\nreflect the new types of conflict and the factors that give rise\r\nto the crises and tensions of today’s world.\r\nBut, as was stated by a number of delegations during\r\nthe general debate, peace is not simply the absence of war.\r\nPeace must also be a positive attitude characterized by\r\nharmony among individuals and nations, where the\r\nrelationship between peace and social development has\r\nbecome a special concern and a dedication to achieving the\r\nwell-being of peoples, thereby strengthening that peace for\r\nwhich we yearn so much.\r\nWithin these parameters, the University for Peace has\r\nmuch to contribute, since it is through the University that\r\nintellectuals and academics from different spheres of\r\nknowledge can participate in this tremendous task, to which\r\nthe leaders of such very different parts of the world are\r\ndevoted. The University’s endeavours should be aimed at\r\noffering a fresh perspective in providing appropriate\r\nsolutions in keeping with the needs of the governed and the\r\ngoverning in order to enable them to deal with their\r\nrespective problems.\r\nTherefore, we encourage the continuation of the\r\nconferences organized by the University, such as, for\r\nexample, the one held in July in Geneva, \"Peace Now -\r\nWhat can we do to achieve it?\", at which the causes of\r\nglobal conflict were analysed and a series of suggestions put\r\nforward by eminent personalities on the various fields of\r\naction to promote peace.\r\nWe fully support those suggestions, in particular the\r\none that indicates that:\r\n\"A central relationship exists between peace and\r\ndevelopment. Violence and war thrive on hunger and\r\npoverty, just as do the violation of human rights and\r\nthe absence of social justice. The University will\r\ntherefore include an analysis of development, human\r\nrights and social development problems. It will\r\nexamine in detail the relationship between peace and\r\ndevelopment.\"\r\nThis consideration and these analyses should give rise\r\nto conclusions which, inter alia, could contribute to the\r\npreparatory work for the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Copenhagen in March 1995.\r\nThe main problems to be taken up at this high-level meeting\r\nwill be poverty, unemployment and social disintegration,\r\nwhich have a direct bearing on efforts at securing world\r\npeace.\r\nIn addition, the University for Peace has an opportunity\r\nto play a key role in the development of the new tasks\r\nrequired by \"An Agenda for Peace\". In particular, methods\r\nof analysis and action for conflict prevention must be\r\nimplemented.\r\nThe programmes being carried out by the University for\r\nPeace will in the short term make it possible to integrate an\r\nimportant contingent of experts into the international public\r\nsector, into academic organizations and into other public and\r\nprivate institutions; and this, together with the activities\r\ncarried out by the University in a number of fields, deserves,\r\nin our opinion, to be more widely disseminated to the\r\ngeneral public. It is essential that all sectors be informed of\r\nthe principles of this programme and of the broad range of\r\nactivities being carried out, which, in the final analysis, are\r\nbut the application in practice of those principles.\r\nIn this context, the University for Peace, as an agency\r\ndedicated to the education and training of men and women,\r\nhas an important role to play so that, within the framework\r\nof the United Nations Charter, people can work for the\r\nbenefit of their societies and for justice and peace throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nThe University for Peace, in the spirit of its founding\r\nCharter, indicates that:\r\n\"Peace is the primary and irrevocable obligation of a\r\nnation and the fundamental objective of the United\r\nNations; it is the reason for its existence. However, the\r\nbest tool for achieving this supreme good for\r\nhumankind, namely education, has not been used.\"\r\n(resolution 35/55, annex to the Agreement, Appendix to\r\nthe Charter, para. 2)\r\nThe efforts the University for Peace has undertaken\r\nsince its foundation must not remain the University’s alone\r\nbut must also be taken up individually, by every State in the\r\nworld, to ensure that the establishment of peace is\r\nparamount; hence we shall be able to devote ourselves first\r\nand foremost to the well-being and the development of our\r\npeoples.\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Before proceeding to take action\r\non the draft resolution, I should like to announce that the\r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors of draft resolution\r\nA/48/L.11: Cuba, Romania, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.11.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.11?\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.11 was adopted (resolution\r\n48/9).\r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n22?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 23\r\nPROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE\r\nPEACE IN THE WORLD\r\nMrs. CASTRO de BARISH (Costa Rica) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): The head of my delegation earlier expressed\r\nto Mr. Insanally Costa Rica’s great pleasure at seeing him\r\npresiding over the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession. It is a pleasure for me as well to take advantage of\r\nthis opportunity personally to congratulate him, as I\r\nparticipate in the consideration of an item which is\r\nextremely important to Costa Rica, \"Programmes and\r\nactivities to promote peace in the world\".\r\nAs members are aware, this item was the result of the\r\nevolution of the Proclamation, during the fortieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, of 1986 as the International Year of\r\nPeace, which crowned the celebration of the fortieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations in 1985. That\r\nProclamation was the cornerstone of a series of activities and\r\nprogrammes which, as we can see from the report of the\r\nSecretary-General submitted to the forty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly (A/46/549), have been growing in number\r\nand, at the same time, generated an increased interest on the\r\npart of States Members of the United Nations,\r\nnon-governmental organizations, academic, scientific and\r\neducational institutions at all levels, as well as on the part of\r\nindividuals wishing to cooperate with and help the United\r\nNations in its efforts to attain one of its primary objectives,\r\nnamely, the promotion of peace in the world.\r\nIndeed, beginning this year, a number of events,\r\nprogrammes and activities have been held in many parts of\r\nthe world, as the result in practice of the Proclamation and\r\nof its observance. The General Assembly adopted a number\r\nof resolutions in sessions subsequent to 1986 on the item\r\nwhich subsequently became \"Achievements of the\r\nInternational Year of Peace\".\r\nThe succinct but complete information on the subject\r\ngiven in the \"Annotated preliminary list of items to be\r\nincluded in the provisional agenda of the forty-eighth regular\r\nsession of the General Assembly\" makes it clear that:\r\n\"the General Assembly took note with appreciation of\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General; expressed its\r\nsatisfaction at the many activities and programmes\r\ninspired by the guidelines prepared by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and by his designation of organizations and\r\ncities as \"Peace Messengers\", which had contributed\r\npositively to promoting peace through their sustained\r\ncooperation with the United Nations; welcomed the\r\nimportant role played by the Peace Studies Unit of the\r\nDepartment of Political and Security Council Affairs of\r\nthe Secretariat in promoting peace, encouraging\r\nactivities and exchanges of information on peace-related\r\nsubjects among the non-governmental organizations,\r\nacademic and scientific institutions and cities around\r\nthe world, and stimulating action to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations as an instrument for peace; welcomed\r\nthe important and peaceful changes that had taken place\r\nin many countries of the world in order to bring about\r\npolitical and social changes towards more democratic\r\nsystems of government; invited Member States,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and academic,\r\nscientific and educational institutions at all levels, as\r\nwell as individuals, to continue their efforts to assist the\r\nUnited Nations in promoting peace in the world; and\r\nrequested the Secretary-General to invite Member\r\nStates and organizations concerned to report to him on\r\ntheir activities and initiatives in pursuit of those ends\r\nand to submit a report thereon to the Assembly at its\r\nforty-eighth session (resolution 46/14).\" (A/48/100,\r\npara. 23, p. 66)\r\nThe report, of course, is to be submitted in fulfilment of the\r\ncited resolution.\r\nNotwithstanding all that is indicated in this document,\r\nwe have not been provided with the report requested in the\r\nresolution. The Peace Studies Unit was eliminated and the\r\nrelevant information was not requested of Member States as\r\nrequired in resolution 46/14, which was adopted without a\r\nvote by the General Assembly. It would mean much to\r\n36th meeting - Monday, 25 October 1993 11\r\nknow why the Unit was eliminated, given that the document\r\nprepared for the present session of the General Assembly\r\n\"welcomed the important role played by the Peace Studies\r\nUnit\", thus recognizing the importance of its activities.\r\nIt seems relevant to add that in addition to the activities\r\nlisted in the text of the document I have just quoted, a wide\r\nvariety of international conferences, seminars, round tables,\r\nand encounters at different levels have examined various\r\naspects of the promotion of peace. Some of them have\r\ncontinued their work each year since the proclamation of the\r\nInternational Year of Peace, while others are new initiatives,\r\namong which are the 1988 Ecoforo on peace and the\r\nenvironment, held in Bulgaria; the first world conference on\r\n\"Tourism: A Vital Force for Peace\" held in Vancouver,\r\nCanada, sponsored by the Tourism Canada, among others,\r\nand supported by the World Tourism Organization; the\r\nstudent peace festivals held each year in the city of\r\nYokohama, Japan, and the Youth Chess Festival for Peace\r\nsponsored by the World Chess Federation; and two seminars\r\nheld by the Muslim Congress, one on international peace and\r\nthe world’s children and the other on international peace and\r\nworld literature.\r\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) sponsored an international congress\r\non \"Peace in the Minds of Men\" in Yamoussoukro, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, from 26 June to 1 July 1989, in the context of the\r\nachievements of the International Year of Peace. The\r\ncongress, organized in cooperation with the Houphouët-\r\nBoigny International Foundation for Peace dealt with two\r\nprincipal items: peace among men and peace in the relation\r\nbetween man and the environment.\r\nEducation for peace, especially at the levels of primary\r\nand secondary education, has been integrated into many\r\neducational programmes. In Norway, a new official syllabus\r\ndrawn up in 1987 included an increase in references to peace\r\nand human rights; a training programme for teachers on\r\nthese subjects was also started with extremely positive\r\nresults. The National Permanent Committee of Peru on\r\nEducation for Peace, established during the International\r\nYear of Peace, undertook research on subjects related to\r\npeace and sponsored teacher-training courses with emphasis\r\non the \"Culture of Peace\" and \"Education for Peace\".\r\nSpecial emphasis has been placed on the role of educators as\r\nagents for peace. In Poland, an annual prize was established\r\nfor a professor of peace studies and for the best book on\r\nsubjects related to peace.\r\nNew institutions have been established to address\r\nspecific aspects of peace through research and discussion.\r\nAmong these are the Costa Rica Foundation for Peace and\r\nHuman Progress and the European Institute for bringing\r\ntogether East and West, a Greek initiative, so as to place it\r\nunder the auspices of the Council of Europe. The\r\nNorwegian Kornhaug Fredssenter was created to serve as a\r\nnational centre for peace. There are plans to create a\r\nEuropean university centre for research on peace, as well as\r\nfor an international centre for peace initiatives in Bombay,\r\nIndia. The Australian Government provided financial\r\nassistance for a research centre for peace at the National\r\nUniversity of Australia.\r\nIn June 1989, the University for Peace in Costa Rica\r\norganized on important event, held in my country’s capital,\r\nSan José. \"The Conference in Search of the True Meaning\r\nof Peace\" was one of the achievements of the International\r\nYear of Peace, attended by hundreds of participants of\r\nvarious nationalities, religious beliefs, political persuasions\r\nand professional standings. The well-known declaration\r\nentitled \"The Declaration of Human Responsibilities for\r\nPeace and Sustainable Development\" was adopted at that\r\ntime, affirming the need for individuals and Governments to\r\ncommit themselves to protecting the environment and\r\nresolving their differences and conflicts by peaceful means.\r\nSince this Declaration contains many of the postulates and\r\nprinciples already adopted in various forums and resolutions\r\nof the United Nations system, it was circulated in document\r\nA/44/L.16 in 1989, as part of the documentation on the\r\nachievements of the International Year of Peace.\r\nThe Declaration emphasizes that\r\n\"according to the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the\r\nequal and inalienable human rights of all members of\r\nthe human family is the foundation of freedom, justice\r\nand peace in the world\". (A/44/626, p. 4)\r\nAnd this fundamental principle leads to another which draws\r\nattention to the\r\n\"challenge posed by the growing imbalances in the\r\ndynamic relationship between population, resources and\r\nthe environment\". (ibid., p. 5)\r\nThe Declaration also calls attention to the\r\n\"urgent need for a greater awareness of the unity of life\r\nand the special character of each of the expressions of\r\nlife, and for a more profound human sense of\r\nresponsibility and a reorientation of human thoughts,\r\nfeelings and actions\". (ibid.)\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nBut now we must face a reality. The Peace Studies\r\nUnit, which, as the General Assembly recognized, was a\r\nvery important factor in promoting and initiating\r\nprogrammes and events to promote peace in the world, no\r\nlonger exists. Neither can we be sure of receiving the report\r\nrequested in the aforementioned resolution on this subject.\r\nIt is important to emphasize the obvious fact that the\r\nprogrammes and activities developed by the Peace Studies\r\nUnit did a great deal to motivate young people in all\r\ncountries where those programmes and activities were held -\r\nand there are many more than those I have mentioned\r\ntoday - as can be seen in the reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the subject, before 1991, which give an idea of\r\nthe repercussions of these events and the dissemination of\r\ninformation on them.\r\nHere there is very little coordination of activities that\r\nwould ensure a better orientation of what is being done in\r\nvarious forums, even during the same session of the General\r\nAssembly. While the Third Committee is expressing\r\nconcern about the need to promote positive and healthy\r\nactivities among young people which would help them to\r\nimprove their approach to behaviour and the moral values of\r\nhuman conduct, some of the very units of the Secretariat\r\nwhich have developed programmes and promoted many\r\nactivities of interest to young people in many countries, both\r\ndeveloping and developed, are, at the same time, being\r\neliminated.\r\nIn view of the new trend towards rationalization, as has\r\nbeen asserted, in order to achieve greater efficiency in the\r\nfunctions of the United Nations, my delegation has decided\r\nto present neither a draft resolution nor a draft decision on\r\nagenda item 23, \"Programmes and activities to promote\r\npeace in the world\", so that at the General Assembly’s forty-\r\nninth session this work may be continued. We shall leave\r\nit to the political will of the different delegations, if they\r\ndeem it relevant, to retain the item in future by making the\r\ncorresponding proposal, under either the same title or\r\nanother which might be considered more appropriate. We\r\nare certain that there will be other items that other\r\ndelegations will propose in order to keep alive the promotion\r\nof peace in the world, because either the next millennium\r\nwill be peaceful, or it will not be at all.\r\nMr. SHRESTHA (Nepal): A common theme running\r\nthrough the statements made in the general debate during the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly has been the\r\nobservation that international relations are passing through\r\nprofound and revolutionary transformations. The hopes for\r\na peaceful and stable world order raised by the end of the\r\ncold war have not yet been realized. Indeed, we are\r\nwitnessing new conflicts and contradictions. Despite these\r\ndifficulties, the Charter of the United Nations continues to\r\nembody the best hopes of mankind. There is no alternative\r\nbut to continue trying to make this world Organization a\r\ncentre for harmonizing the actions of nations for the\r\nattainment of the common ends set out in its Charter.\r\nOne of the most important developments in recent years\r\nhas been the world-wide peaceful revolution leading to the\r\nresurgence of faith in democracy and human rights. As the\r\nRight Honourable Prime Minister of Nepal stated in his\r\naddress to the forty-eighth session of the Assembly, there is\r\na direct correlation between the status of human rights, the\r\ndemocratic process and the evolution of a culture of peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes. My delegation, therefore, looks\r\nforward to sustained programmes and actions of the United\r\nNations aimed at enhancing the present trend towards greater\r\nrespect for democratic values.\r\nThe efforts to strengthen the United Nations as an\r\ninstrument of peace must continue in all seriousness. At the\r\nsame time, we would like to see more emphasis on activities\r\nfor the dissemination of information on peace-related\r\nsubjects. Closer coordination and cooperation with\r\nnon-governmental organizations and academic institutions\r\naround the world will facilitate the attainment of this\r\nobjective.\r\nEfforts to ensure peace and stability will not be able to\r\nmake much headway if the United Nations is not able to act\r\nas the forum for constructive and mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation between the developed and the developing\r\ncountries. Indeed, poverty and backwardness are permanent\r\nthreats to peace and stability. The need for assisting the\r\nleast developed countries in their efforts to promote human\r\nresources development and to alleviate the crushing burden\r\nof poverty are particularly urgent. One of the most welcome\r\nphenomena of the post-cold war era is the decrease in the\r\nglobal volume of military spending. The resources thus\r\nsaved could be utilized to help the least developed countries\r\nhelp themselves.\r\nThere is today greater public understanding of what the\r\nUnited Nations stands for than at any time during the history\r\nof this Organization. The primary purpose of the United\r\nNations is the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. However, it is now widely accepted that the threats\r\nto peace and stability cannot be understood merely in\r\nmilitary terms. The non-military threats to peace have\r\neconomic, social, environmental, ethnic and religious\r\ndimensions. The problems facing the world today are not\r\namenable to solutions through the actions of one or a few\r\npowerful States. They require the partnership of all members\r\nof the international community - big or small, rich or poor.\r\n36th meeting - Monday, 25 October 1993 13\r\nActivities to create a well-informed public opinion on the\r\nnature of problems and the potentials of the United Nations\r\nto find lasting solutions to them would greatly facilitate the\r\nwork of a rejuvenated United Nations.\r\nMr. LOPEZ (Philippines): At the outset, I would like\r\nto join previous speakers in extending to\r\nAmbassador Insanally our cordial felicitations on his election\r\nas President of the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Philippines takes pride in being a founding\r\nMember of the United Nations, and our Government, under\r\nPresident Fidel Ramos, would like to take this opportunity\r\nto acknowledge with deep appreciation the efforts of this\r\nworld body to respond to crisis situations, to put an end to\r\nconflicts and to restore peace in the world. Allow me,\r\ntherefore, to express the gratitude of my countrymen for this\r\nprivilege of addressing the General Assembly.\r\nWe are here to consider one of the primary objectives\r\nof the United Nations: the promotion of peace in the world.\r\nWe regret that the report of the Secretary-General requested\r\nin operative paragraph 6 of resolution 46/14 is not available\r\nfor consideration by the General Assembly. With the\r\nincreasing interest in the United Nations and its momentum\r\nin meeting the new challenges of a new and dynamic\r\ninternational environment, the Philippine delegation hopes\r\nthat this important report will be completed soon.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 46/14 states that:\r\n\"peace is not merely the absence of war and ...\r\ninterdependence and cooperation to foster human rights,\r\nsocial and economic development, disarmament,\r\nprotection of the environment and ecosystems and the\r\nimprovement of the quality of life for all are\r\nindispensable elements for the establishment of peaceful\r\nsocieties\". (resolution 46/14, fourth preambular\r\nparagraph)\r\nPreventive diplomacy is now becoming a vital tool for\r\npractical action for the promotion and maintenance of peace\r\nin the world. As the Secretary-General noted in his \"Agenda\r\nfor Peace,\" it includes efforts designed to prevent the\r\noccurrence of armed conflict through such measures as\r\nconfidence-building, early warning, fact-finding and\r\npreventive deployment. We are pleased to note the\r\nincreasing resort of the United Nations and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to the use of preventive diplomacy to address the\r\nmany conflict situations in our post-cold-war world.\r\nThe commitment of the Philippine Government to peace\r\nstarts in its own back yard. It is the concern of our\r\nGovernment, under President Ramos, to create an\r\nenvironment of peace and security, principally through social\r\nand political reforms so that development can be sustained.\r\nActually, the Philippines has sought to translate its firm\r\ncommitment to peace and the peaceful resolution of disputes\r\nby undertaking peace initiatives at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels. Under the leadership of\r\nPresident Ramos the advancement of peace and\r\nreconciliation has been one of the priorities of his\r\nAdministration. In July of last year, President Ramos signed\r\nProclamation 10-A establishing the National Unification\r\nCommission. That Commission has been given the task of\r\nformulating and recommending, after consultations with\r\nconcerned sectors of the society, a viable general-amnesty\r\nprogramme and peace process that will lead to a just,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace. Towards that end the\r\nCommission has undertaken exploratory discussions with\r\nauthorized representatives of the various armed rebel groups\r\naimed at getting input for the peace process and at laying the\r\ngroundwork for the holding of formal peace negotiations.\r\nAt the present time meetings between government\r\nrepresentatives and the representatives of two groups are\r\nscheduled to be held in different countries. It is hoped that\r\nthey will add further momentum to the peace process. We\r\nare grateful to the Governments of Indonesia and Viet Nam\r\nfor their generous assistance in agreeing to play host to those\r\nnegotiations.\r\nIn addition to its dialogue with representatives of armed\r\nrebel groups, the National Unification Commission has been\r\nconducting consultations with other sectors of the society at\r\nboth the national and local levels to generate among all the\r\ncitizenry, whether organized or not, an awareness of and\r\ninterest in peace issues, inter alia, and to mobilize their\r\nactive support for and participation in both the formulation\r\nand implementation of a peace process.\r\nOn the regional level the Philippines, together with its\r\npartners in the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), namely, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia,\r\nSingapore and Thailand, initiated the establishment of the\r\nASEAN Regional Forum to discuss regional security among\r\ncountries in the Asia-Pacific region and those that have\r\nstakes in the area - the ASEAN dialogue partners and\r\ncountries with significant influence and interest in this part\r\nof the world. The Philippines has also taken steps to explore\r\nareas of cooperation in the South China Sea with the\r\ninterested countries in the region.\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe Philippines also adheres to the principle enshrined\r\nin the Charter of the United Nations that the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security is a collective responsibility.\r\nTowards the fulfilment of this principle the Philippines has\r\ncontributed both human and material, military and civilian\r\nresources to the United Nations Transitional Authority in\r\nCambodia (UNTAC). In that regard we in the Philippines -\r\nas well, I am sure, as the other States that participated in\r\nUNTAC - are deeply satisfied that UNTAC has\r\naccomplished its primary mission of ushering in a new\r\nConstitution and a freely elected Government for Cambodia,\r\na Government based on the will of the Cambodian people.\r\nWe are proud to have been a part of this successful peace\r\nendeavour of the international community.\r\nThe Philippine Government reaffirms its unequivocal\r\nsupport for the efforts being made to find lasting peace in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, to restore the hope of the people of\r\nSomalia and to bring back democracy under a civilian\r\nGovernment in Haiti.\r\nThe current dangers to global peace require sustained\r\nvigilance and emphasis on the United Nations ability to\r\nfunction effectively. In further reaffirmation of our commit\r\nto world peace we call upon the international community to\r\ncontribute significantly to the dismantling of the remaining\r\nvestiges of the cold war. We are particularly disturbed by\r\nthe attempts to downgrade the importance of the nuclear-test\r\nban and to make nuclear inspection a painful exercise for the\r\nUnited Nations agencies concerned. We call upon the\r\nUnited Nations to find a way out of this problem.\r\nNo matter how critics view our world Organization we\r\ncontinue to have abiding faith in the ability of the United\r\nNations to arrest the escalation of those problems into crisis\r\nproportions. We believe that the United Nations has a key\r\nrole to play in the maintenance of global peace and the\r\npromotion of development. Let us anchor our sense of\r\nurgency on the premise that we owe world peace to our\r\nchildren.\r\nBetter yet, we should know that only a generation that\r\nwas able to establish a lasting basis for world peace may\r\nhave the right to look forward to and pray for a world of\r\nwhich succeeding generations can be truly proud. If we can\r\nshow them the way to peace, they will not only value what\r\nwe shall leave them. They too will learn where to stand\r\nwhen a choice is once more presented between war and\r\npeace.\r\nWe hope that through our initiatives today they do not\r\nhave to make a choice, because we have already chosen\r\npeace for them, and all they have to do is to keep it always\r\nburning in their hearts and minds.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item. May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n23?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 167\r\nBUILDING A PEACEFUL AND BETTER WORLD\r\nTHROUGH SPORT: DRAFT RESOLUTIONS\r\nA/48/L.8/Rev.1 AND A/48/L.9/Rev.1\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on the representative of\r\nEgypt to introduce the two draft resolutions under this\r\nagenda item.\r\nMr. ELARABY (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Egyptian delegation, which requested, in its capacity as\r\nthe current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU), the inclusion on the agenda of the forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly of an additional item\r\nentitled \"Building a peaceful and better world through sport\",\r\ntakes pleasure in introducing today the two draft resolutions\r\npresented under agenda item 167.\r\nThe first draft resolution, A/48/L.8/Rev.1, relates to the\r\nrequest made to the General Assembly to proclaim 1994 as\r\nInternational Year of Sport and the Olympic Ideal; the\r\nsecond, A/48/L.9, calls upon Member States to observe the\r\nOlympic Truce. The Council of Ministers of the OAU, at its\r\nfifty-eighth session held in June 1993 in Cairo, adopted a\r\nresolution, which the African summit meeting endorsed and\r\nthus endorsed the initiatives which are now contained in\r\nthese two draft resolutions. The main thrust of the two draft\r\nresolutions is to support the efforts deployed by the Olympic\r\nMovement towards building a better and peaceful world by\r\neducating and mobilizing the youth of the world through\r\nsport and culture with a view to promoting international\r\nunderstanding between the young in consonance with the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe International Olympic Committee, founded in 1894,\r\nwill be celebrating its centenary next year. That Committee\r\nis making sincere efforts to implement the Olympic ideals.\r\nThe appeal launched during the Barcelona 1992 Olympic\r\nGames to revive the ancient Greek tradition of the Olympic\r\nTruce was endorsed by 184 National Olympic Committees.\r\nIn that respect, the International Olympic Committee has\r\n36th meeting - Monday, 25 October 1993 15\r\nreceived letters of support from the Heads of States, Prime\r\nMinisters and Foreign Ministers of 120 States.\r\nIn fact, there is a very close link between the objectives\r\nof the United Nations and the Olympic Movement, which\r\nwas the first organization to voice concern over the policy\r\nof apartheid in the 1950s and which decided to suspend and\r\nisolate South Africa from membership in 1970, a decision\r\nwhich was not revoked until a non-racialist Olympic\r\nCommittee was set up in South Africa. Furthermore, the\r\nCommittee has allocated $2 million from its budget to\r\nfinance development programmes for the poor Black\r\ncommunities of South Africa. I should also like to highlight\r\nthe Committee’s assistance to the city of Sarajevo, site of the\r\n1984 Winter Olympic Games, and its cooperation with a\r\nnumber of States to sponsor Bosnian athletes. The\r\nCommittee has also cooperated with the United Nations\r\nfollowing the Rio Conference on the Environment.\r\nThis is the first time in the history of the United\r\nNations that the Olympic Movement has requested support\r\nfor its initiatives in the service of peace. Indeed, the drive\r\nto educate and mobilize youth in the service of peace is a\r\nnoble goal that deserves our full support. I should also like\r\nto point out that the International Olympic Committee will\r\nbe observing the International Year of Sport and the\r\nOlympic Ideal with the support of national and international\r\nOlympic and sports committees. This will entail no\r\nadditional financial burdens for the United Nations. For all\r\nof these reasons, I would ask the General Assembly to adopt\r\nthe draft resolutions contained in documents A/48/L.8/Rev.1\r\nand A/48/L.9 by consensus.\r\nI should like to make an oral revision to draft resolution\r\nA/48/L.9. I will speak in English.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn the first preambular paragraph, the words \"the\r\nNational\" should be replaced by the words \"one hundred\r\neighty-four\". The subsequent words \"of one hundred eighty-\r\nfour countries\" should be deleted. The revised paragraph\r\nwill therefore read as follows:\r\n\"Considering the appeal launched by the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee for an Olympic\r\nTruce, which was endorsed by one hundred eighty-four\r\nOlympic Committees and presented to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral,\"\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nAll of the sponsors of this draft resolution have\r\nendorsed this revision.\r\nMr. YAÑEZ BARNUEVO (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): This year the General Assembly thanks to the\r\ninitiative of Egypt, on behalf of the Organization of African\r\nUnity, has an opportunity to consider a very special issue.\r\nEver since the classical age, sport has served the lofty ideals\r\nof peace and brotherhood among peoples. Ancient Greece\r\ngave birth to an activity in which men competed not for the\r\nimmediate goal of power, but to exceed their own limits by\r\nmatching them with those of other competitors.\r\nIt has often been said that competition in sports results\r\nfrom men’s aggressive instincts and is merely a means to\r\nsublimate them. That may well be true; if so, the human\r\nrace has acquired a tool with which to transform the desire\r\nto fight into an urge to compete; the impulse to destroy into\r\na will to win; and the thirst to dominate others into a search\r\nfor self-discipline.\r\nThe universal social function of sports was stressed by\r\nHis Majesty King Juan Carlos of Spain on the occasion of\r\nthe last Olympic Games, held in my country, when he\r\npointed out that the Games today:\r\n\"have become associated with the ideals of peace,\r\ncooperation and communication between peoples, and\r\nthey accordingly have immense symbolic value. The\r\npolitical, economic, racial, religious or other differences\r\ndividing mankind become less significant. Tolerance\r\nthereby prevails and, with it, friendship\".\r\nMy delegation sponsored the draft resolutions on the\r\nproclamation of 1994 as International Year of Sport and the\r\nOlympic Ideal and on the Olympic Truce because we\r\nsupport the ideals underlying them. These initiatives help\r\nfoster understanding and dialogue between individuals and\r\npeoples and are directed towards ensuring that the Olympic\r\nspirit is disseminated more widely throughout the world by\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIn 1992 my country organized, at Barcelona, the Games\r\nof the twenty-fifth Olympiad of the modern era. There\r\nSpain welcomed athletes and visitors alike with open arms,\r\naware of the historic importance of what has become a\r\nmilestone in the contemporary history of the Olympic\r\nMovement. After a number of games in which not all\r\ncountries members of the Olympic Movement participated,\r\nBarcelona prompted participation by them all: they made\r\ncommon cause in sport, setting aside differences and\r\nconfrontations.\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe Barcelona Games were honoured by the presence\r\nat the opening ceremony of 36 Heads of State and of the\r\nChairman of the African National Congress of South Africa\r\n(ANC), the recent Nobel Prize laureate Nelson Mandela,\r\nwhose presence set a seal on the return of South African\r\nathletes to international sporting competition, thus helping\r\nput an end to the nightmare of apartheid.\r\nBarcelona was also the site of a procession of athletes\r\nwhose countries had been torn by tragic conflict; their\r\nparticipation helped fire the hope that one day the wounds -\r\nthen as now, open wounds - would be healed for the benefit\r\nof peace and human dignity.\r\nMayor Pasqual Maragall of Barcelona transmitted to the\r\nathletes and to the entire world the appeal for peace\r\ncontained in a message from the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\r\nThe International Olympic Committee, under the\r\npresidency of the Spaniard Juan Antonio Samaranch, has\r\nmade every effort to make sport more than an arena for\r\ncompetition between material interests and passions\r\ninconsistent with the spirit that should prevail in sport. Too\r\noften, professional sport has taken the path of\r\ncommercialism, placing the accent more on translating sport\r\ninto material terms than on the inner satisfaction gained\r\nthrough an athlete’s performance and on the spectator’s\r\naesthetic pleasure.\r\nThe International Olympic Committee seeks also to\r\nre-establish another basic dimension: sport as an aspect of\r\nculture and as a vehicle in the service of humanitarian ideals.\r\nThe first dimension is fully expressed in the declaration of\r\n1994 as the International Year of Sport and the Olympic\r\nIdeal on the occasion of the centenary of the modern\r\nOlympic Movement. The dissemination of the Olympic\r\nideal at the national and international levels should promote\r\nunderstanding and solidarity among individuals and peoples.\r\nThe second draft resolution, which revives the age-old\r\ntradition of an Olympic Truce, is aimed at instilling a spirit\r\nof brotherhood and understanding among peoples and at\r\ngiving them a reason to suspend their confrontations and an\r\nopportunity to reflect on ways to end them.\r\nI wish to conclude by expressing my delegation’s hope\r\nthat our words will be transformed into actions, conflicts into\r\ndialogue, and the Olympic Truce into a lasting peace. The\r\nenmity that fuels these conflicts will not disappear because\r\nwe say so; we cannot conjure up understanding with a\r\nmagical incantation. This is a difficult, long-term task that\r\nneeds all the energy and tenacity the international\r\ncommunity can bring to it.\r\nToday, the General Assembly has the opportunity to\r\nserve as a special instrument for these efforts aimed at\r\nmaking peace and harmony the expression of a renewed\r\ndetermination for understanding among people.\r\nMr. VAN DE CRAEN (Belgium) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): On behalf of the European Community and its\r\nmember States, I have the honour to speak on agenda\r\nitem 167, \"Building a peaceful and better world through\r\nsport\".\r\nIn 1994 the International Olympic Committee will mark\r\nits hundredth anniversary. A century ago, inspired by the\r\nOlympic Games of ancient Greece, Pierre de Coubertin made\r\nhis historic appeal for the modern revival of the Olympic\r\nGames. In antiquity and in modern times, Europeans have\r\nshown, by their presence and their active participation, their\r\nlively interest both in sport and in building the goals of the\r\nOlympic Movement.\r\nBeyond sport itself, we fully subscribe to the ideals of\r\nthe Olympic Movement, as proclaimed even during the\r\ngames in ancient Greece. Those ideals were aimed at\r\nhelping build a peaceful and better world by encouraging\r\nyoung people to practise sport free of discrimination, in a\r\nspirit of mutual understanding, friendship, solidarity and fair\r\nplay. All those ideals, indeed, further the purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nIn this context of sport, peace, humanism and tolerance,\r\nthe European Community and its member States welcome\r\nthe two draft resolutions before the Assembly.\r\nWe welcome the appeal made by the International\r\nOlympic Committee and endorsed by the Council of\r\nMinisters of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to\r\ndeclare 1994 the International Year of Sport and the\r\nOlympic Ideal. Through sport and culture, the Olympic\r\nideal promotes international understanding among world\r\nyouth; hence, we think it is proper and timely to link it with\r\nthe International Year of the Family, to be declared on\r\n7 December 1993. We therefore call on the International\r\nOlympic Committee, international sport federations and\r\nnational Olympic Committees to work together to coordinate\r\ntheir activities with the administrative structure already set\r\nup by the United Nations, in order to avoid duplication.\r\nThe European Community and its member States also\r\njoin in the International Olympic Committee’s appeal for the\r\nrevival of the Olympic Truce to be observed by all parties\r\n36th meeting - Monday, 25 October 1993 17\r\nto conflicts from the seventh day preceding the opening of\r\neach summer and winter Olympic Games to the seventh day\r\nafter the closing ceremony of the Games. The Ekecheria\r\nwas established in ancient Greece in the ninth century B.C.\r\nto enable athletes, artists and their families, as well as\r\npilgrims, to travel in safety. A commitment by Member\r\nStates, individually and collectively, to respect the truce\r\nwould contribute to the peaceful settlement of international\r\nconflicts.\r\nThe adoption of the two draft resolutions before us by\r\nthe broadest possible consensus would send an important\r\nmessage to the international community, and especially to\r\nyouth - which still embodies our hopes for a better world.\r\nMr. DUGAN (United States of America): It is in a\r\nspirit of building a peaceful and better world through sport\r\nthat my delegation is pleased to join in sponsoring the draft\r\nresolutions before the General Assembly today entitled\r\n\"Observance of the Olympic Truce\" and \"International Year\r\nof Sport and the Olympic Ideal\".\r\nIn 1889, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, himself but a\r\nyouthful 26 years of age, set for himself an Olympic-sized\r\ngoal: to build a better and peaceful world by educating the\r\nyouth of the world through sport and culture. To that end,\r\nhe conceived the idea of reviving the classical Olympic\r\nGames of ancient Greece, where the spirit of fair play\r\nprevailed.\r\nAt an international congress in 1894, he found support\r\nwhen he stated:\r\n\"Let us export our oarsmen, our runners, our\r\nfencers into other lands. That is the true free trade of\r\nthe future; and the day it is introduced ... the cause of\r\npeace will have received a new and strong ally ... so\r\nthat together we may attempt to realize, upon a basis\r\nsuitable to the conditions of our modern life, the\r\nsplendid and beneficent task of reviving the Olympic\r\nGames.\"\r\nThe International Olympic Committee was founded,\r\nindependent of Governments or any organizations, with the\r\nkey aim of collaborating with others to place sport at the\r\nservice of humanity.\r\nThe first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens\r\nin April 1896, with 13 nations sending nearly\r\n300 participants to 42 events involving 10 different sports.\r\nNow, over 170 nations send over 11,000 athletes to\r\nparticipate in more than 400 events involving more than\r\n41 different sports.\r\nIt has been my country’s honour to have hosted the\r\nOlympic Games in St. Louis, Los Angeles, Lake Placid and\r\nSquaw Valley - and, now, to welcome the world to Atlanta\r\nin 1996.\r\nDuring those years, the world has witnessed glory and\r\ntragedy on the playing field, but, more significantly, on the\r\nbattlefield. My delegation has joined in sponsoring today’s\r\ndraft resolution entitled \"Observance of the Olympic Truce\"\r\nto promote the peaceful settlement of all international\r\nconflicts as a visible symbol to the youth of the world.\r\nThe revival of the Olympic Games gave an impetus to\r\nsport that has gradually spread throughout the world, so that\r\nthe number of encounters between countries in various sports\r\nhas increased exponentially over the years. I refer not\r\nmerely to world championships in sports, but, far more, to\r\nthe interchange of individuals and of club and national\r\nteams, and to the sharing of their talents.\r\nMy country is therefore honoured today to join in\r\nsponsoring also the draft resolution entitled \"International\r\nYear of Sport and the Olympic Ideal\".\r\nMr. EXARCHOS (Greece): May I, in the first place,\r\nrefer to the statement just made by the representative of\r\nBelgium in his capacity as President of the European\r\nCommunity; I fully support that statement.\r\nThe Greek delegation welcomes, as is only natural, the\r\ninitiative undertaken, within the framework of our world\r\nOrganization, to observe the Olympic Truce. In this\r\ninstance, we are particularly pleased that the initiative is also\r\nbeing supported by the Organization of African Unity, as\r\nrepresented by the representative of Egypt, and that the draft\r\nresolution before us, namely, draft resolution\r\nA/48/L.9/Rev.1, has been so widely sponsored. This proves\r\nthat an idea and a practice that originated long ago in ancient\r\nGreece is expanding around the world within the framework\r\nof the modern Olympic Movement.\r\nThe origins of the Olympic Truce go back to the eighth\r\ncentury B.C., and its originators were Iphitos and\r\nKleosthenes, leaders of city-States in the region of ancient\r\nOlympia. It soon - and for a long time - became a generally\r\naccepted practice among the Hellenic city-states of the time.\r\nRefraining from military operations during the Olympic\r\nGames - the Olympic Truce - may, in our troubled times\r\ntoo, provide an opportunity in the quest for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes; such settlements, as experience has so\r\nfar, unfortunately, shown, are harder to seek in the heat of\r\nwarfare. This, as a matter of fact, is contained in the spirit\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nof Ekecheria, which, if we go back to its etymology, means\r\nholding back one’s hand - that is, the temporary cessation of\r\nhostilities.\r\nNeedless to say, we hope to see the draft resolution\r\nbefore us adopted unanimously; for the same reason, we\r\nhope that draft resolution A/48/L.8/Rev.1, on the Olympic\r\nideal, will also be adopted without a vote. This would\r\nindeed be an important and welcome message to the world,\r\na message in whose expression young people will have a\r\nprominent role to play.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now proceed to\r\ntake decisions on the draft resolutions before it, in\r\ndocuments A/48/L.8/Rev.1 and A/48/L.9/Rev.1, as orally\r\nrevised.\r\nI should like to announce that the following countries\r\nhave become sponsors of both draft resolutions:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Belarus, Bhutan,\r\nBrunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Canada, China,\r\nCosta Rica, El Salvador, Eritrea, Georgia, Germany,\r\nGuatemala, Hungary, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy,\r\nJapan, Nepal, New Zealand, Oman, Panama, the Republic of\r\nKorea, Seychelles, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan.\r\nFor draft resolution A/48/L.8/Rev.1 alone, the following\r\ntwo countries are additional sponsors: Latvia and Lithuania.\r\nFor draft resolution A/48/L.9/Rev.1 alone, Angola is an\r\nadditional sponsor.\r\nThe Assembly will first turn to draft resolution\r\nA/48/L.8/Rev.1, entitled \"International Year of Sport and the\r\nOlympic Ideal\".\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.8/Rev.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.8/Rev.1 was adopted\r\n(resolution 48/10).\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now turn to\r\ndraft resolution A/48/L.9/Rev.1, entitled \"Observance of the\r\nOlympic Truce\".\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.9/Rev.1, as orally revised?\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.9/Rev.1, as orally revised, was\r\nadopted (resolution 48/11).\r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n167?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.35 p.m.\r\n"
