"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n37th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nTuesday, 26 October 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 112\r\nINTERNATIONAL DRUG CONTROL\r\nHIGH-LEVEL PLENARY MEETINGS TO\r\nEXAMINE THE STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL\r\nCOOPERATION AGAINST THE ILLICIT\r\nPRODUCTION, SALE, DEMAND, TRAFFIC AND\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF NARCOTICS AND\r\nPSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES: DRAFT\r\nRESOLUTION (A/48/L.12)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I shall make a statement by way of\r\nintroduction to item 112, now before the General Assembly.\r\nThe global spread of drug abuse has emerged as a\r\nmajor international concern in the post-cold-war era.\r\nGovernments are finding that the foundations for peace and\r\nprosperity have been undermined by this insidious threat.\r\nThe international community’s success in controlling drug\r\nabuse will serve as a litmus test of its ability to respond to\r\nthe complex problems of the post-cold-war era. Can the\r\ninternational community effectively translate word into deed\r\nin the global campaign against illicit drugs? The answer to\r\nthis question will provide an indication of whether we can\r\ncross the threshold into a better world where nations can\r\ncooperate harmoniously for their common good.\r\nThese plenary meetings, held in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/99, coincide with a turning\r\npoint in the history of international relations. On the one\r\nhand, we see the global convergence of international society\r\nwith as much hope for peace as risk of conflict. On the\r\nother, we see the world-wide spread of drug abuse,\r\nevidenced by the proliferation of illicit markets and the\r\nincreasing prevalence of addiction. It may appear as though\r\nthese two trends are unrelated, but they may in fact be\r\ndriven by the same factors. A look at one or two\r\nmanifestations of this transitional period may reveal the\r\ndirection in which we must proceed at the multilateral level.\r\nLet us consider, for example, the formidable challenge\r\nfacing some of the new democracies. Economic reforms\r\nrequired a massive injection of capital into many of the\r\nburgeoning market-led economies. This need for capital is\r\nwitnessed at all levels of society. Governments are running\r\nbudget deficits. Consumers are finding it increasingly\r\ndifficult to afford the basic necessities. In this context, what\r\nis the illicit drug industry if not a source of abundant capital\r\nand employment? What are illicit drugs if not a highly\r\nlucrative commodity? Severe economic difficulties can at\r\ntimes overshadow the criminal dimensions of drug-related\r\nactivity. Some newly independent countries have established\r\nsafe-money havens as a way to attract urgently needed\r\nforeign capital - this, despite the detrimental impact of\r\nmoney-laundering on monetary stability. This type of\r\nresponse underlines the direct link between the needs\r\nushered in by the post-cold-war era and the potential\r\nworsening of drug-related crimes.\r\nYet another noteworthy aspect of the post-cold-war era\r\nis the new role of certain developing countries in the world\r\neconomy. Today, a growing number have the prospect of\r\nstable growth and integration into the world economy.\r\nForeign direct investment is changing the nature of their\r\ninternal markets. Governments have privatized a major\r\nproportion of inefficient State-owned industry. And\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86970 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.37\r\n12 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nflourishing stock-markets have sprouted up with\r\nunprecedented vigour.\r\nThese three changes - the increase in foreign direct\r\ninvestment, the wave of privatization, and the growth of\r\ndeveloping-country stock-markets - are positive at a time of\r\nslow growth in the global economy. But they also represent\r\na watershed opportunity for drug-trafficking syndicates and\r\ncriminal organizations. Drug syndicates can manipulate the\r\nflow of foreign direct investment to \"recycle\" their illicit\r\nrevenues in the guise of legal business. Privatization can\r\nshorten the regulatory reach of Governments, and thereby\r\nallow drug traffickers to operate in the face of fewer\r\nconstraints. And less official oversight in the pharmaceutical\r\nindustry can facilitate the diversion of precursors and\r\nessential chemicals into illicit channels.\r\nAnother group of developing nations still find\r\nthemselves in a desperate situation with little evidence to\r\nsuggest that their economic plight is over. The members of\r\nthis latter group far outnumber those of the prospering\r\ndeveloping countries. For these nations, the pre-eminent\r\ncharacteristic of this post-cold-war period is the extent to\r\nwhich their economies have been marginalized. Already we\r\nsee disturbing drug-related consequences. Some of these\r\ncountries have evolved into main trafficking channels\r\nthrough which illicit drugs are transported from producer to\r\nconsumer markets. Whereas economic dynamism may be a\r\ncause for drug abuse elsewhere, for many of these countries,\r\nstagnation and hopelessness are the driving forces behind the\r\nspread of drug-related trends.\r\nSo for those and many other reasons, the threat posed\r\nby illicit drugs is greater than ever before as we turn to a\r\nnew chapter in history. And it will continue to grow unless\r\nwe act together at the multilateral level. Indeed, I must\r\nemphasize that it is not only with regard to the new\r\ndemocracies and developing countries that we must ensure\r\nthe success of international drug-control efforts. Rather,\r\ngiven the global nature of illicit drugs, and given the rapid\r\nadvances in trade, telecommunications and travel, all\r\ncountries together face this spectre. And it is together that\r\nthey must respond.\r\nWe must recognize the multidimensional nature of drug\r\nabuse and the underlying factors that contribute to its\r\nworldwide dimensions. And we must achieve a globally\r\nbalanced approach in which illicit demand, supply and\r\ntrafficking are tackled as interconnected parts of a single\r\nglobal phenomenon.\r\nOnce drugs enter society, the upward spiral of illicit\r\nproduction, consumption and trafficking will follow. In this\r\ncontext, the drug menace is a common threat to all nations.\r\nThe concept of shared responsibility, so clearly emphasized\r\nat the 1987 International Conference on Drug Abuse and\r\nIllicit Trafficking, must serve as the basic principle behind\r\nour efforts.\r\nThe foundations for progress have been established.\r\nThe international drug-control conventions provide the legal\r\nbasis and the common language with which Member States\r\ncan respond to the emerging crisis of illicit drugs. The\r\nGlobal Programme of Action, which was adopted by this\r\nAssembly in 1990, outlines the necessary strategy which we\r\nmust endeavour to implement. And the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme ably serves as the\r\nfocal point for drug control efforts at the multilateral level.\r\nAs in the days ahead we advance our deliberations on\r\nhow best the international community might continue to\r\naddress the drug pandemic, let us remember the\r\ncommitments we have undertaken and proceed to their full\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe Secretary-General has asked me to convey his\r\napologies for not being with us this morning. He has\r\ncommunicated a message to the General Assembly, and I\r\nshall now call upon the Executive Director of the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme, Mr. Giorgio\r\nGiacomelli, to read out the Secretary-General’s message to\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. GIACOMELLI (interpretation from French): I\r\nshall now read out a message from the Secretary-General.\r\n\"Drugs are a scourge of our time, whose evil\r\nconsequences extend deep and far; they cause\r\ncorruption, destabilization, violence and suffering.\r\nDrugs are, sadly, a major cause of insecurity in the\r\nworld.\r\n\"We must therefore be under no illusion: drug\r\nabuse is now a global threat, on the same scale as\r\ndamage to the environment, the pandemic of acquired\r\nimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or poverty itself.\r\nIt is therefore our duty to respond to this threat with\r\ninternational solidarity.\r\n\"These four plenary meetings are clear proof of our\r\nresolve to tackle this question within a clear\r\ninternational framework. In fact, during the past seven\r\nyears, the international community has gradually\r\nbecome aware of the new dimension of drug-abuse-\r\nrelated problems.\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 3\r\n\"The International Conference on Drug Abuse and\r\nIllicit Trafficking, held at Vienna in 1987, stressed the\r\ncollective responsibility of all States in the struggle\r\nagainst drugs. The following year, the international\r\ncommunity strengthened decisively the array of legal\r\ninstruments at its disposal by adopting the Vienna\r\nConvention on illicit trafficking.\r\n\"In 1990, the General Assembly, at its seventeenth\r\nspecial session, took another decisive step forward\r\nwhen it adopted the Political Declaration and the\r\nGlobal Programme of Action, and gave the United\r\nNations a central role in the development of\r\ninternational cooperation in the fight against drugs.\r\nThese political, legal and operational measures should\r\nnow be completed by the implementation of the United\r\nNations System-wide Action Plan on Drug Abuse\r\nControl (SWAP).\r\n\"With the setting up in 1991 of the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), the\r\ninternational community has at its disposal an effective\r\nstructure and instrument to carry out its stated goals.\r\n\"Since its creation, UNDCP has undertaken an\r\nin-depth re-examination of international anti-drug\r\nstrategy, covering both the experience gained to date\r\nand the results. That analysis has enabled UNDCP to\r\nidentify new principles and new strategic directions and\r\npriorities, which have subsequently been submitted for\r\nconsideration to the intergovernmental organs. They\r\nand, in particular, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs,\r\nhave given their support to the new global action\r\nprogramme and strategy.\r\n\"This strategy, which rests - and I stress this point -\r\non a global approach, treats all aspects of the problem\r\nin a fair and balanced way, taking into account the\r\ncultural and social needs appropriate for each country\r\nand each region. The strategy is to be carried out at\r\nthree levels: national, subregional on regional and\r\nglobal.\r\n\"First, the country level: when drawing up and\r\nimplementing social and economic development\r\nprogrammes, each State should adopt a master plan to\r\ncombat drugs in line with national priorities. I cannot\r\noverstress the importance of legislative and institutional\r\nmeasures and the need to ensure their compatibility\r\nboth with the letter and with the spirit of international\r\ntreaties.\r\n\"At the same time, if cooperation and coordination\r\nare to be successful internationally, each country\r\ninternally should establish an effective mechanism,\r\nendowed with appropriate legal authority, to coordinate\r\naction against drugs in every aspect: education,\r\ninformation, health care, social reintegration, control\r\nmeasures, the administration of justice, and social and\r\neconomic development.\r\n\"Secondly, to ensure that they have the widest\r\npossible impact, these measures should be carried out\r\nin a regional or subregional framework based on\r\ninternational cooperation agreements, providing for,\r\ninter alia, the exchange of information, and also\r\nensuring that drug control measures and the promotion\r\nof broader common initiatives, especially in strategic\r\nsectors such as frontier zones, are effectively\r\nharmonized.\r\n\"The third and final level, that of action at the\r\nglobal level, should involve the rigorous and universal\r\napplication of international conventions; they provide\r\nthe fundamental legal framework and true common\r\ndenominator within which the national legislation of\r\neach State should be integrated.\r\n\"If we are to make our international efforts truly\r\nglobal, then it goes without saying that all relevant\r\ngroups within our societies must also be mobilized. I\r\nhave in mind here non-governmental organizations,\r\nprofessional and business organizations, the university\r\nworld, schools, the mass media, and sports movements.\r\nTogether, and with the support of local regional and\r\nnational authorities, we must set up more and more\r\nintegrated networks to forge a true partnership, thus\r\nensuring a clear link between all the actions undertaken.\r\nI also look towards the organizations of the system for\r\na sustained dialogue under the auspices of the UNDCP.\r\n\"At the same time, regional and international\r\ndevelopment bodies and, in particular, the development\r\nfinance institutions, should also take on an increasingly\r\nimportant role in the fight against drugs; indeed they\r\nshould make it a permanent factor in their development\r\npolicies and also coordinate their activities more closely\r\nwith those of the UNDCP.\r\n\"Today the international community has an\r\neffective arsenal at its disposal - a strategy, a field of\r\naction and an effective coordinating instrument. While\r\nof course improvements can always be made to that\r\narsenal, we should now shift the emphasis to action.\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\n\"If we are to rise to the challenge, we must ensure\r\nthat the means at our disposal are adequate to the task\r\nahead. We must also bear in mind two key aspects: on\r\nthe one hand, the speed with which the scourge\r\nspreads, with all of its consequences for society and\r\ncriminality; and on the other hand, the fact that civil\r\nsociety is showing increasing impatience, leading to\r\nsimplistic or defeatist solutions. More than ever,\r\nresolute action is needed at the level of the very planet\r\nitself. That is why it is essential that the international\r\ncommunity should take this opportunity to restate its\r\ncommitment to the fight against drugs. That is why\r\nthat commitment must be translated into meaningful\r\naction by a serious effort to mobilize the necessary\r\nresources world wide.\"\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to propose, if I hear\r\nno objection, that the list of speakers in the debate be closed\r\ntoday at 12 noon.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nI therefore ask those representatives wishing to\r\nparticipate in the debate to inscribe themselves on the list of\r\nspeakers as soon as possible.\r\nIn this connection I should like to remind members that\r\nthe General Assembly at its 30th plenary meeting, held on\r\n14 October 1993, decided that in view of the large number\r\nof member States already inscribed on the list of speakers,\r\nthe length of statements should be limited to 10 minutes. I\r\nshould like to inform members that a white flashing light\r\nwill be activated at the rostrum to let the speaker know that\r\nthe 10-minute limit has elapsed. Your cooperation in this\r\nregard is very kindly invited.\r\nI am now pleased to call on His Excellency, the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Social Affairs of Sweden,\r\nMr. Bengt Westerberg.\r\nMr. WESTERBERG (Sweden): There is an evident\r\nneed for public and political awareness of the health hazards\r\nof drug abuse, but there is also a need for awareness of the\r\nvery negative effects of narcotics on the development of our\r\nsocieties in economic, social and democratic terms. Drugs\r\nare not merely substances subject to abuse. They also lead\r\nto poverty, lack of faith in the future, violence, corruption\r\nand organized crime. Wherever narcotics are available we\r\nfind drug abuse. And wherever there is intravenous drug\r\nabuse we also have the problem of HIV infection. In certain\r\nEuropean countries the majority of those suffering from\r\nAIDS are drug addicts.\r\nWhen the drug problem was relatively new it was\r\nnatural to concentrate a high proportion of our resources on\r\nlaw enforcement, but we have now had sufficient\r\nexperience of this problem to realize that there are several\r\naspects to be taken into consideration. We have to attack\r\nthe drug problem at all levels, employing a balanced,\r\ncomprehensive and multidisciplinary approach.\r\nIn my own country there are some relatively\r\nencouraging indications of an improvement in the drug-abuse\r\nsituation. The proportion of young drug abusers is steadily\r\ndeclining. We believe that our restrictive drug policy has\r\ncontributed to this. Measures to deal with illicit drugs have\r\nbeen given high priority within the social and health sector\r\nand in the law-enforcement area.\r\nAll the measures employed should give the same\r\nmessage to our young people: we do not accept any use of\r\nillicit drugs; we will never approve of a distinction being\r\ndrawn between soft drugs and hard drugs. Cannabis is not\r\na harmless drug; there is considerable scientific evidence of\r\nits detrimental effects on mental health and its links with\r\nviolence.\r\nI should like to emphasize strongly that the main\r\nresponsibility for reducing drug abuse must rest on\r\ntraditional consumer countries. It is not acceptable to blame\r\nonly those countries in which production and trafficking take\r\nplace. Consequently, there is a need for policies and\r\nstrategies for the prevention of drug abuse that focus, in\r\nparticular, on reducing the demand for illicit drugs.\r\nAt the same time, however, I should like to stress that\r\nthe intensification of efforts to reduce demand must not\r\nmean any relaxation of our vigilance in regard to measures\r\nfor dealing with international drug crime. It is estimated that\r\nthe illicit-drug trade has an annual turnover corresponding to\r\n10 per cent of world trade. An increase in illicit narcotics\r\ncan be noted at all levels - cultivation, processing, trafficking\r\nand consumption.\r\nSome people are giving up the battle, claiming that the\r\nnarcotics problem is insurmountable. They refer to the fact\r\nthat we have been unable to solve the problem within the\r\nframework of existing legislation. But the conclusions they\r\ndraw are quite different from conclusions arrived at by the\r\nSecretary-General in his evaluation of the implementation of\r\nthe Global Plan of Action. The Secretary-General stressed\r\nthe importance of the reinforcement, by Member States, of\r\ntheir judicial and legal systems in the fight against drugs,\r\nwhile the defeatists consider that we should dismantle\r\ncontrols.\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 5\r\nI am convinced that a strategy of liberalization, and\r\nultimately of legalization, would make it impossible to solve\r\nthe narcotics problem. It would lead to an enormous\r\nexpansion of drug abuse and would cause untold drug-related\r\ndamage to public health and to society at large. As a result,\r\nthe international community has considerable responsibility\r\nin this matter. We must not surrender to the\r\nhead-in-the-sand policy advocated by the supporters of\r\nlegalization. On the contrary, we must face up to the\r\nproblem and recognize - not just in words but in deeds - that\r\ninnovative, multidisciplinary and long-term measures are\r\nrequired.\r\nThe entire United Nations system must be activated in\r\nthe fight against drugs. Last year, this forum decided to\r\ncreate a new tool for the coordination of United Nations\r\nfield activities: the United Nations Country Strategy Note.\r\nThis is to be a concerted strategy for United Nations\r\nactivities in each individual country, planned jointly with the\r\nrecipient Government. If United Nations operations to deal\r\nwith illicit drugs are to be effective, it is important that the\r\nUNDCP master plan be integrated into the United Nations\r\nCountry Strategy Note. The role that we have given the\r\nUNDCP, as a result of our decision in the General Assembly\r\nin December 1990, is that of a United Nations Centre of\r\nExcellence in the drug-control sphere. But the question is\r\nwhether we, as Member countries, have given the UNDCP\r\nrealistic opportunities to live up to this role. For several\r\nyears, voluntary contributions have amounted to\r\napproximately $80 million per year - a fraction of the total\r\nannual turnover of the international illicit-narcotics market.\r\nBut the question of resources cannot be discussed\r\nmerely in volume terms - it is also a matter of bearing a fair\r\nshare of the burden. Our grand statements referring to the\r\ncomplexity and scope of the issue, coupled with our\r\ncreation, three years ago, of new institutions to combat illicit\r\ndrugs, will sound somewhat hollow if expenditure continues\r\nto be low and unevenly distributed, even among so-called\r\nmajor donors. In many developed countries, the current\r\neconomic outlook is either poor or deteriorating, but this\r\nmust not be allowed to be an excuse for passiveness. The\r\nconsequences of inaction would be a threat to future\r\ngenerations. Efforts to stem the consumption of illicit drugs\r\nmust be stepped up.\r\nAs donor countries, we are responsible for contributing\r\nto a discussion of priorities. This means, in my view, that\r\nwe must jointly draw up the overall guidelines, rather than\r\nfocus on detailed project control. At a time when we have\r\nlimited funds at our disposal, it is even more important that\r\nthey should be employed in a strategic manner. The role of\r\nthe UNDCP as a catalyst is of vital importance in this\r\ncontext, particularly in the alternative development area\r\nwhere the involvement of other United Nations agencies is\r\nessential. This applies also to the role played by the\r\nfinancial institutions.\r\nAs one of the countries which initiated the process that\r\nled to the adoption of the Global Programme of Action, we\r\nare deeply committed to fulfilling our responsibilities. I\r\ntherefore consider that Member States have a duty to follow\r\nup and implement the Programme at the national and\r\ninternational levels. I am pleased that there is broad\r\nconsensus within the Assembly on this matter.\r\nA step in the right direction will therefore be the\r\nadoption, by this Assembly, of the draft resolution initiated\r\nby Mexico. The proposal includes several elements that\r\ncould strengthen the international struggle against narcotic\r\ndrugs. The deliberations at the coordination segment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in 1994 will provide a unique\r\nopportunity for discussion between all the relevant United\r\nNations bodies, with the object of achieving more effective\r\nimplementation of the Global Programme of Action. The\r\nproposal to be made to the high-level segment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in 1995 will result in\r\nappropriate adjustments of drug-control activities, where\r\nnecessary.\r\nThe inclusion of this issue on the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil’s agenda in 1994 and 1995 ensures that the\r\nnecessary commitment and momentum will be maintained.\r\nBut let me also stress the value of an ad hoc expert group,\r\nwhich is mentioned in the last paragraph of the draft\r\nresolution (A/48/L.12). A group of this kind is not a new\r\nmethod of working within the United Nations; it was used to\r\nimplement the decisions taken at the special session, for\r\nexample. This is an effective way of arranging for a\r\ncompetent and candid outsider to review our efforts. If the\r\nresult is total support for the present policy, all the better.\r\nFor a number of years now, we have been making\r\npolitical statements about the devastating effects of the\r\nnarcotics problem. In 1987 we convened the International\r\nConference in Vienna; in 1990 the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the World Summit in London. At the\r\nspecial session, we also agreed on substantial reforms of the\r\nstructures for dealing with illicit narcotic substances. We\r\nshould now ask ourselves if this is enough. Have our\r\ndecisions brought us any closer to a solution of the problem?\r\nCould we do more by adopting another approach?\r\nThere is a tendency - which we all share - to convene\r\nat high-level meetings, declaring our resolution and our\r\ncommitment to fighting the global problems of illicit narcotic\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ndrugs. Then we return home and occupy ourselves with\r\nother matters of importance. But the problem of illicit\r\nnarcotics must be fought back home, in our respective\r\ncountries. At the end of the day, responsibility rests with\r\neach of us and all of us gathered here today. It cannot be\r\ndelegated to somebody else.\r\nMr. BAI Jingfu (China) (interpretation from Chinese):\r\nIn February 1992, at its seventeenth special session, the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopted the Political Declaration and the\r\nGlobal Programme of Action, which defined the aim and\r\ndirection of international narcotics-control activities. In the\r\ncourse of past years a number of drug-control measures have\r\nbeen taken, and positive results have been achieved by\r\nindividual countries and international society to reduce the\r\nthreat of illicit drugs. We should bear in mind, however,\r\nthat the global trend of drug production, abuse and illicit\r\ntrafficking is still moving in the wrong direction.\r\nIn the consideration and discussion of the international\r\ndrug problem and in the designing of more effective\r\nstrategies and policies, full attention should be paid to two\r\nfactors which are both objective and decisive in the current\r\nillicit drug situation. One is the extensive illicit sources of\r\ndrugs, and the other is the international illicit-drug-\r\nconsuming markets. It is these two factors that seriously\r\nincrease the problem of illicit-drug trafficking and make\r\nnarcotics control an arduous and time-consuming task for the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nTherefore, in the implementation of the international\r\ndrug-control strategy, the questions of how to reduce illicit\r\nproduction, reduce the demand for narcotics and combat\r\nillicit drug trafficking effectively should be considered and\r\ndealt with as being of equal importance, with a view to the\r\nadoption of comprehensive measures. At the same time, the\r\nlevel of a country’s social and economic development must\r\nbe taken into account when it is preparing to launch its drug-\r\ncontrol campaign.\r\nThough we are facing a serious drug situation,\r\ncircumstances conducive to the elimination of the illicit-drug\r\nproblem are also emerging. I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to mention a few points regarding international\r\ndrug-control cooperation.\r\nFirst, such cooperation must be kept in accordance with\r\nthe objective reality of the general pattern of the global drug\r\nproblem with a view to formulating policies of international\r\nnarcotics-control cooperation and to planning UNDCP\r\nactivities. Full consideration should be given to the different\r\nareas. The subregional drug-control strategy pursued by the\r\nUNDCP in the Golden Triangle area is developing in an\r\nappropriate way, and it is practical to lay emphasis on the\r\nsubregional project designed both to reduce illicit opium-\r\npoppy cultivation by promoting comprehensive rural\r\ndevelopment and to eliminate illicit-drug trafficking by\r\nstrengthening drug-law enforcement. Coordination\r\ncooperation activities between neighbouring countries\r\nthrough the UNDCP is also a good method. These policies\r\nand activities should be reaffirmed and improved further.\r\nSecondly, more positive measures should be taken to\r\nencourage those countries which have not yet acceded to and\r\nratified the 1988 Convention to do so as soon as possible.\r\nThe States parties to the 1988 Convention should be urged\r\nboth to undertake the obligations set out therein and to\r\nimplement the Convention in all seriousness.\r\nThirdly, the Global Programme of Action is a principal\r\ndocument based on national experiences in narcotics control\r\nand adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth\r\nspecial session. All States should be encouraged to take\r\neffective action to implement it in their own circumstances.\r\nWhile efforts should be taken at the national level,\r\nimplementation also needs to be accelerated at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nFourthly, international cooperation on narcotics control\r\nshould be applied on the basis of mutual benefit and respect\r\nfor each other’s sovereignty.\r\nThe illicit-drug problem represents a great threat to the\r\nhealth of people everywhere and to the stability of a society.\r\nBecause of its geographical position and the policy of\r\nopening up, China is inevitably influenced by and suffering\r\nfrom the increasing invasion of activities relating to the\r\ntransit of illicit drugs. Constant efforts have been made by\r\nthe Chinese Government in past years to strengthen its\r\nnational narcotics-control measures.\r\nIn formulating and planning its domestic drug-control\r\npolicies, the Chinese Government took the Global\r\nProgramme of Action fully into consideration. The\r\nimplementation of the Global Programme of Action by the\r\nChinese Government is reflected in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General. However, I should like to speak briefly\r\nabout the important measures taken by the Chinese\r\nGovernment last year and the main successes achieved.\r\nStrict measures have been taken to suppress drug-\r\ntrafficking crimes relating to the transit of drugs. In 1992\r\nthe Chinese drug-law-enforcement agencies cracked 14,701\r\ndrug cases, with the seizure of 4,489 kilograms of heroin,\r\n2,660 kilograms of opium and 910 kilograms of cannabis.\r\nThe quantity of heroin seized during the year was 1.4 times\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 7\r\nas much as that seized in the previous year. During the first\r\nsix months of 1993, a total of 7,817 drug cases were handled\r\nby the Chinese drug-law-enforcement agencies, with the\r\nseizure of 1,945 kilograms of opium, 1,898 kilograms of\r\nheroin and 100 kilograms of cannabis. Those figures and\r\nfacts clearly show the trend of increasing illicit-drug-\r\ntrafficking activities through China and, on the other hand,\r\nthe determination and effectiveness of the Chinese\r\nGovernment’s drug-law-enforcement efforts.\r\nPublicity and education activities on narcotics control\r\nhave been further promoted. To raise social awareness,\r\ngovernment at all levels is mobilized to carry out extensive\r\npublicity activities on the danger of illicit drugs and on the\r\nnational drug laws and regulations through the various mass\r\nmedia, such as broadcasting, television programmes and\r\nnewspapers. Young people, especially middle-school\r\nstudents, are targeted for the main educational programme.\r\nReading materials on narcotics control are published by the\r\nNational Narcotics Control Commission and distributed\r\nnationwide. Various mass campaigns were carried out in the\r\nprovinces where illicit-drug problems exist, in accordance\r\nwith the programmes of the United Nations Decade against\r\nDrug Abuse and the observance of 26 June as International\r\nDay against Drug Abuse.\r\nEfforts for drug detoxification and rehabilitation have\r\nbeen promoted further. According to nation-wide statistics,\r\nthe total number of drug addicts is 250,000 at present; 252\r\ncompulsory drug-detoxification centres have been set up by\r\nlocal governments, and 46,000 drug addicts have gone\r\nthrough compulsory drug-detoxification programmes. A\r\ncommunity monitoring system has been formed, in an effort\r\nto keep the relapse rate at a lower level. The Chinese\r\nGovernment has given high priority to consideration of the\r\nprevention and treatment of AIDS deaths related to drug\r\naddiction.\r\nGreat steps have been taken in controlling the chemicals\r\nthat can be used for illicit drug production. Though it is\r\nrather difficult to control some of these chemicals effectively\r\nbecause of their extensive use in industry, the Chinese\r\nGovernment still respects the decision made by the United\r\nNations Commission on Narcotic Drugs and has enforced an\r\nexport-licence system, effective since 1 April 1993, to\r\ncontrol the 22 chemicals listed in the 1988 Convention. A\r\nspecial regulation has also been enacted and applied to\r\ncontrol effectively the production, distribution and\r\ntransportation of ephedrine, including such measures as\r\ndistribution strictly according to the national plan, licensed\r\npurchasing and the rule of one licence for one shipment.\r\nStrict measures have been imposed along the border areas in\r\nYunnan province to prevent any illicit exportation of\r\nchemicals that could be used for drug manufacture.\r\nThe Chinese Government has always been in favour of\r\nstrengthening international cooperation on narcotics control.\r\nIn order to fight the scourge brought on the international\r\ncommunity and China by external drug sources and drug\r\ntransit, China has supported and taken an active part in the\r\nsubregional drug-control strategy and cooperation\r\nprogrammes initiated by the UNDCP. The Subregional Drug\r\nControl Project signed between China, Myanmar and the\r\nUNDCP now in course of implementation. The Chinese\r\ndrug-law-enforcement agencies are playing an active role\r\nand taking a positive attitude in joint drug investigation and\r\ninformation exchange with neighbouring countries and other\r\nregions. Good relations have been maintained in this regard.\r\nThe Chinese Government highly commends the holding,\r\nat this forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, of these\r\nspecial plenary meetings on drug abuse and trafficking with\r\nthe aim of further enhancing international drug-control\r\ncooperation. It is our sincere hope that through the special\r\nmeetings, more Member States will accede to and ratify the\r\n1988 Convention and that multilateral cooperation on\r\nnarcotics control will subsequently be strengthened.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Melchior Wathelet, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Justice and Economic Affairs of Belgium.\r\nMr. WATHELET (Belgium) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): It is a great honour for me to speak in this\r\nprestigious Hall on behalf of the European Community and\r\nits Member States.\r\nIn welcoming the interesting guidelines on our work\r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s proposals, I should like\r\nfirst of all to emphasize that the assessment of the state of\r\ninternational cooperation in the fight against drug abuse is\r\neven more necessary and urgent than it was at the time of\r\nour last meeting, as all the data available to us indicate that\r\nthe scourge of drugs has continued to grow, thus spawning\r\na serious and continuous threat not only to the health of\r\nindividuals but also to the very fabric of our societies. It\r\nvery often jeopardizes the political and economic stability of\r\ncountries, as well as their security and their democratic\r\nstructure as a whole.\r\nGiven the diversification of that threat, which is now\r\nseverely affecting a growing number of countries, especially\r\nin Africa and Eastern Europe but in every other region of\r\nthe world as well, only an intensification of international\r\ncooperation on a global level will enable us to cope with this\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ndanger and present a sufficiently broad and effective front\r\nagainst it. That is our responsibility as political leaders, and\r\nwe must shoulder it fully and in a spirit of complete\r\nsolidarity.\r\nIn this connection it is the view of the European\r\nCommunity and its member States that the special meetings\r\nof the General Assembly we are devoting to this subject will\r\nenable us to evaluate the effects of the instruments,\r\nprogrammes and institutional structures we have acquired\r\nover time and to reaffirm our will to engage in joint\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe elimination of the traffic in illicit drugs entails high\r\npolitical, human, economic and social costs. It demands\r\nregional and international solidarity and a genuinely effective\r\nand concerted campaign of mobilization.\r\nMore specifically, a first answer designed to bolster the\r\nmeans of combating illicit drugs in all their forms is the\r\nadherence of all Member States of the Organization to\r\ninternational treaties on the subject, in particular the 1961\r\nSingle Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 Convention\r\non Psychotropic Substances and, especially, the 1988 United\r\nNations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs\r\nand Psychotropic Substances. The latter Convention was\r\nsigned by the European Community and its member States.\r\nThe Community and a large majority of its member States\r\nhave already ratified it, thereby reaffirming the relevance of\r\nits innovative provisions in such areas as confiscation of\r\nproperty and control of deliveries and trade in precursor and\r\nother essential chemical products.\r\nWe would also recall the great importance of rapid\r\nimplementation of the legislative and administrative\r\nmeasures necessary to make national judicial systems\r\ncompatible with the spirit and scope of international treaties.\r\nAs for countries not yet parties to those Conventions, they\r\nshould be encouraged to move to the interim application of\r\ntheir provisions.\r\nThe financial aspect of the illicit trade in narcotic\r\nsubstances and the involvement of banks and financiers in\r\nthe laundering of often colossal sums of money derived from\r\ndrug traffickers has become a major concern for States,\r\nwhich must take all the measures necessary to ensure that\r\nactivities of this type cannot be conducted from their\r\nnational territory.\r\nIn the view of the European Community and its\r\nmember States, the establishment this year of a single\r\nmarket without interior borders must not lead to such\r\nreprehensible activities as illicit drug trafficking and the\r\nmoney laundering that accompanies it. This is why a joint\r\nstrategy and a constant flow of information between the\r\nservices specializing in security and customs matters have\r\nbeen initiated to guarantee uniform and homogeneous control\r\nof the Community’s external borders.\r\nThe entry into force since on 1 January of this year of\r\nthe European directive on money laundering has provided\r\nthe Governments of the countries involved with a valuable\r\ntool in the struggle they are jointly waging to overcome the\r\ndrug scourge. Similarly, emphasis must also be placed on\r\nthe need for eligible States to ratify the Council of Europe\r\nConvention of 1990 on money laundering and the detection,\r\nseizure and confiscation of the byproducts of crime.\r\nThe opportunity of acquiring enormous illegal profits is\r\nan especially tempting lure for the criminal underworld,\r\nwhose activities adjust to the passions and ills of our society.\r\nThus, the European Community and its member States\r\nconsider that the optimum means should be found to\r\nestablish close links between the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme and the United\r\nNations Crime Prevention Programme in order to coordinate\r\nand amplify efforts in this area.\r\nReal progress has also been made since 1990 within the\r\nframework of international cooperation in preventing the\r\ndiversion for illicit purposes of precursor and other essential\r\nchemical products. Where the European Community is\r\nconcerned, this cooperation has led to the adoption of a body\r\nof regulations detailing steps to be taken to prevent the\r\ndiversion of certain substances to the illicit production of\r\nnarcotic drugs or psychotropic substances and of a directive\r\non the production and commercialization of precursors in the\r\nEuropean zone.\r\nThat progress has enabled us to support the resolution\r\nadopted last spring by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs,\r\nwhich was designed to follow up the recommendations of\r\nthe Action Group on Chemical Products of the Group of\r\nindustrialized countries and to assign a clear-cut role to the\r\nInternational Narcotics Control Board and the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme.\r\nOur efforts to cooperate within the Trevi Group,\r\ncomprising the Ministers of Justice and Interior of the\r\nCommunity’s 12 member States, and within the framework\r\nof the Mutual Assistance Group of Customs Authorities have\r\nalso been stepped up. As an example I would mention here\r\nthe June 1991 decision to create a European Police Office,\r\nknown as Europol. I hope that by 1 January 1994 the\r\nagreement signed in June of this year by the appropriate\r\nMinisters providing for the establishment of a Joint\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 9\r\nInformation Unit on Drugs, to be known as the Europol\r\nDrug Unit, will have been effectively implemented.\r\nAs emphasized in the Political Declaration and the\r\nGlobal Programme of Action adopted by the General\r\nAssembly in 1990, the fight against the scourge of drugs\r\nrequires joint international action. The European\r\nCommunity and its member States, for their part, have\r\nconcluded with third countries and with regions many\r\nagreements containing clauses calling for cooperation in\r\ncombating drugs. Here, I would defer to the statement to be\r\nmade by Commissioner Flynn of the Commission of the\r\nEuropean Community.\r\nThe European Community and its member States also\r\nreaffirm the importance of international efforts undertaken to\r\neliminate illegal drug crops. These meetings provide us with\r\nan opportunity to analyse and assess those efforts and to\r\nemphasize the solidarity required between consumer and\r\nproducer and transit countries. The European Community\r\nand its member States have already concluded cooperation\r\nagreements with many countries to assist them in identifying,\r\neradicating and replacing the illicit crops used to produce\r\ndrugs. They are prepared to consider other possibilities.\r\nThe Community and its member States are also\r\nparticipating fully in the activities of the Dublin Group,\r\nwhich is organizing informal consultations on drug-related\r\nproblems between the European Community and Australia,\r\nCanada, Japan, Norway, the United States of America,\r\nSweden and the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme. The Dublin Group has thus been able,\r\ninter alia, to hold a meeting at Cartagena to consider the\r\nassistance to be given the Colombian judicial system.\r\nMeetings devoted to Eastern Europe, Central Europe and the\r\nBalkans have also been held in order better to define and\r\norganize assistance to the countries of those regions. A\r\nmultilateral partnership is thus beginning to take shape on\r\nthe regional level.\r\nAs the Economic and Social Council again emphasized\r\nat its session last July, the reduction of demand is one of the\r\nkey objectives of the campaign against drugs and drug\r\nabuse. It has a central place in the implementation of the\r\nEuropean Plan against drugs adopted by the Council of\r\nEurope at Rome in 1990 and updated by the Council of\r\nEurope at Edinburgh in 1992.\r\nWe feel that a balanced approach to activities designed\r\nto reduce demand should be followed up by giving, within\r\na multidimensional approach, suitable priority to prevention\r\nand to the treatment, rehabilitation and social reintegration\r\nof drug addicts. As the available statistics indicate, drug\r\nabuse affects individuals of all social strata in all age groups,\r\nespecially the young and, to an increasing degree, women.\r\nInformation exchanges at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels on programmes and policies developed\r\nwithin the framework of reduction of demand would be\r\nparticularly appropriate. This should be carried out within\r\nthe framework of existing institutions, in particular the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme.\r\nThe European Community and its member States are\r\ntaking certain initiatives to this end. As an example I would\r\nmention the establishment of a European observation post to\r\nobtain objective, reliable and comparable data at the\r\nEuropean level on all the factors linked to the phenomenon\r\nof drug abuse and its often-tragic consequences. The\r\nobservation post will focus particular attention on demand\r\nand its reduction.\r\nThe European Community and its member States also\r\nwish to recall the important role played by non-governmental\r\norganizations, many of which are actively specialized in this\r\nsphere, and the contribution they can make in the drawing\r\nup and implementation of measures to be undertaken by\r\npublic authorities to reduce demand and combat drug abuse,\r\nparticularly in assisting those authorities in mobilizing public\r\nopinion and in disseminating messages of prevention, above\r\nall to young people.\r\nIf our joint struggle against the drug scourge can and\r\nmust be made more effective through determined action by\r\neach of us on the national level and by stepped-up regional\r\nand international cooperation, it will nevertheless remain\r\nfutile without coordination at the United Nations level.\r\nThe adoption of the Political Declaration and the Global\r\nProgramme of Action by the General Assembly in 1990\r\ncontributed greatly to shaping the international will. With\r\nthe establishment of the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme in 1991 the international community\r\ncreated the programmes, means and structures most\r\nappropriate to pursuing the path we have laid out for\r\nourselves. The assessment exercise in which we are engaged\r\ntoday affords us an opportunity to reiterate the great\r\nimportance we attach to seeing that our efforts at\r\ninternational cooperation are based on stable, effective and\r\noperational structures.\r\nThe European Community and its member States are\r\ndetermined to give their full support to the new approaches\r\nand methods of action now available to UNDCP for reacting\r\nquickly and flexibly to developments and to the\r\ndiversification of the drug problem throughout the world. In\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nparticular, they wish to emphasize the pivotal role assigned\r\nto UNDCP, which is entrusted with supervising and\r\ncoordinating action by the international community in its\r\ncampaign against drug abuse, identifying new trends,\r\nproposing creative solutions and mobilizing the actions\r\nundertaken by governmental, non-governmental, regional and\r\ninternational institutions.\r\nThe European Community and its member States also\r\nsupport the strategic guidelines of UNDCP, which are based\r\non a tripartite, integrated approach in which a consistent set\r\nof national programmes, regional and subregional approaches\r\nand international priorities neatly dovetail.\r\nThe European Community and its member States fully\r\nsupport the recent efforts of UNDCP to diversify its actions\r\nin the fight against drugs, particularly by devoting a greater\r\npart of its programmes to reducing demand. They also\r\nappreciate the precursor role of UNDCP in certain countries\r\nwhere the drug problem, in terms of production and transit,\r\nis extremely acute. In those cases, UNDCP is often the first\r\nand the only interlocutor of the authorities involved.\r\nWe attach great importance to the effective\r\nimplementation of the Global Programme of Action at the\r\nUnited Nations system level. It is of crucial importance to\r\nmaximizing the effect of the fight against drugs that the\r\nvarious organs of this body, including its financing agencies,\r\nbe called upon to take immediately, and in their respective\r\nspheres, appropriate drug-abuse measures and to include an\r\nanti-drug dimension in their policies, programmes and\r\nbudgets.\r\nIt is not, however, sufficient to encourage UNDCP to\r\nstep up its cooperation with international financial\r\ninstitutions. The Member States of our Organization must\r\nfor their part continually emphasize in the various directive\r\nbodies of these institutions the need to pool their efforts and\r\ntheir work, each one in its respective sector.\r\nThe role of coordination within the United Nations\r\nsystem to ensure the success of the Global Programme of\r\nAction devolves on UNDCP and its Executive Director, Mr.\r\nGiacomelli, for whom the European Community and its\r\nmember States reiterate their full support. The recent\r\ngranting to the Executive Director of greater autonomy\r\nconcerning the management of the services of UNDCP and\r\nthe staffs made available to him is a tangible sign of the\r\nhopes and the confidence our Organization is placing in the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme.\r\nAware that a consistent and balanced approach to the\r\nfight against drug abuse will bear fruit only if UNDCP is\r\ngiven adequate resources, the Community and its member\r\nStates fervently hope that controlling drug abuse will remain\r\none of the highest priorities in determining the regular\r\nbudget and the medium-term plan of the United Nations.\r\nWe urgently call on the international community to send a\r\nclear message along these lines. We also appeal for an\r\nincrease in voluntary contributions, on which UNDCP\r\ndepends to a great extent to cope with the growing needs\r\nwhich it must meet.\r\nThe Commission on Narcotic Drugs must remain the\r\nprimary decision-making organ of the United Nations in the\r\narea of drug control. It is that body which approves, on the\r\nbasis of proposals of the Executive Director, the programme\r\nbudget of the UNDCP Fund. It plays an extremely\r\nimportant role in the promotion and follow-up of the Global\r\nProgramme of Action. The European Community and its\r\nmember States welcome the advocacy by the Commission on\r\nNarcotic Drugs of an expansion of coordination on all levels,\r\nincluding that of operational activities in the field.\r\nDecision-makers must ensure, through assessment\r\nreports, lasting continuity and consistency in the programmes\r\nestablished to fight drug abuse. Measures should be\r\nimmediately taken to attain this objective. Once these\r\nconditions have been met, UNDCP and the Commission on\r\nNarcotic Drugs doubtless will be in a better position to carry\r\nout their mandate to exercise control over the\r\nimplementation of the Global Programme of Action.\r\nA large-scale meeting in 1997 to evaluate this\r\nProgramme should be considered. The year 1997 could be\r\nchosen because it marks the halfway point of the United\r\nNations Decade against Drug Abuse. That evaluation\r\nshould, in any case, also deal with the measures undertaken\r\nby Governments for the implementation of the Global\r\nProgramme of Action and of the international Conventions\r\nin the area of the fight against drugs.\r\nI should like to conclude by saying, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Community and its member States, that we are on\r\nthe eve of a new stage in the building of Europe. The\r\nMaastricht Treaty is about to enter into force. Within this\r\nframework, the new structures provide for the better\r\norganization of deliberations aimed at guaranteeing greater\r\nconsistency and stepping up cooperation links. The self-\r\nmotivated and multidisciplinary approach which the\r\nEuropean Community and its member States have always\r\nhoped to follow in the fight against drugs will only be\r\nreaffirmed by this.\r\nThe European Community and its member States once\r\nagain express their conviction that only concerted action\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 11\r\nbased on a sustained determination to step up regional and\r\ninternational cooperation can make it possible to reverse the\r\ntrend towards the heightening of the drug phenomenon. The\r\nglobal approach at the United Nations level will enable us to\r\ngive the concerted action of Member States the pluralistic\r\ndimension that is indispensable to the success of our joint\r\nstruggle. That is why the European Community and its\r\nmember States continue to support the efforts of UNDCP\r\nand its Executive Director. We hope that our discussions\r\nand the results of our meetings will fully reaffirm this\r\ndetermination on the part of the international community.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Enrique Krauss, Minister of the Interior of Chile.\r\nMr. KRAUSS (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nAllow me, first of all, to express the deep satisfaction of the\r\nGovernment of Chile at the decision taken by the General\r\nAssembly to devote four plenary meetings to reviewing the\r\ncurrent state of international cooperation in combating the\r\nproduction, consumption and illicit trafficking of drugs.\r\nThis is an important opportunity for us to analyse\r\nrigorously, in the highest and most qualified international\r\nforum, the various effects of illicit drug consumption in the\r\nworld. The clear gravity of this issue should prompt us to\r\nthink about how much we are doing, or failing to do, about\r\neliminating this breach of morality from our lives.\r\nMy country notes with concern that the drug problem,\r\nfar from diminishing, is growing in an alarming way in most\r\nof our countries. We know that we share this concern with\r\nthe international community. The priority which the\r\nInter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission has given\r\nto the study of new strategies to cope with this question is\r\nevidence of this. The important work of the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme is moving in the\r\nsame direction.\r\nChile is no stranger to this painful reality. In recent\r\nyears, drug abuse has increased in our society. To make\r\nmatters worse, the use of free-base cocaine has become\r\nparticularly prevalent, especially among young people, with\r\ndangerous effects on their health, as they easily become\r\naddicted.\r\nThe increase in drug trafficking can also be seen in our\r\ncountry, due not only to internal consumption but also to the\r\nuse of our territory as a transit country, particularly for\r\ncocaine, to Europe and North America.\r\nMoney-laundering and the smuggling of essential\r\nchemicals, although they are not major problems, are not\r\nforeign to our situation. Our country’s proximity - so\r\nwelcome for other reasons - to countries that produce\r\ncocaine makes us particularly vulnerable to cocaine\r\ntrafficking. Chile lacks the natural conditions for producing\r\ncocaine.\r\nMoreover, our country’s economic development, which\r\nhas led to a real increase in personal income, has\r\nparadoxically turned the country into a consumer market\r\nattractive to drug sellers. Our open economic system, which\r\nattracts large foreign investment and active foreign trade,\r\nalso attracts those seeking to hide the source of money from\r\ndrug trafficking.\r\nIn Chile, particularly since the installation of the\r\ndemocratic Government of President Aylwin, we have faced\r\nsquarely the fight against drugs.\r\nWe have ratified and promulgated as a law of the\r\nRepublic the 1988 United Nations Convention; we have set\r\nup a National Council for the Control of Illicit Drugs, which\r\ncoordinates the activities of all services related to the\r\nprevention of drug abuse and the repression of drug\r\ntrafficking; we have adopted a national policy of drug abuse\r\nprevention and control; we have presented to the national\r\nCongress a bill which adapts the regulations currently in\r\nforce to the 1988 Convention, a bill which will soon be\r\napproved by the Senate of the Republic; and we have\r\nincreased the budgets of the bodies responsible for\r\nprevention, control and rehabilitation, which has allowed\r\nimportant programmes to be developed and has increased the\r\nefficiency of the state apparatus.\r\nAt the international level, we have increased the level\r\nof our participation in specialized multilateral agencies and\r\nwe have signed bilateral conventions with countries in and\r\noutside of our region, making every effort to see that they\r\nbecome operative.\r\nWe know that a relationship exists between the abuse\r\nand trafficking of drugs and the quality of life of peoples.\r\nFor this reason, we see economic and social development as\r\nthe primary means of dealing with this scourge. Growth\r\nwith equity, the cornerstone of our Government, is for us the\r\nmost appropriate way to deal with the roots of the abuse and\r\ntrafficking of drugs: poverty, the lack of educational\r\nopportunities and the lack of hope. We have therefore\r\nenthusiastically supported the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment which the United Nations will hold in 1995.\r\nDrug abuse is not an isolated problem, and its\r\nconsideration from an ethical and social point of view shows\r\nthat criminalizing laws will not suffice to eliminate it. It is\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nessential to develop plans and programmes developed\r\nspecifically for the prevention of drug abuse and the\r\ntreatment of addicts, and to act resolutely and rigorously\r\nagainst the criminal organizations whose illegal activities\r\nendanger not only the health of the world’s peoples but also\r\nthe security, moral integrity, economy and even the\r\ninstitutions of our nations.\r\nIn the opinion of the Chilean Government, the efforts\r\nof each of our countries will have limited chances for\r\nsuccess without true international cooperation going far\r\nbeyond mere declarations of intent. We cannot view\r\ncooperation for development solely as economic assistance -\r\nthough that is undoubtedly essential for the most unfortunate\r\ncountries - but also and particularly as the removal of the\r\nimpediments standing in the way of free trade for the\r\nproducts of less developed countries, which is essential for\r\nthe growth that will enable us to bring social justice to our\r\ncommunities.\r\nHere, we find the most just and appropriate path for\r\ncooperation in the development of our nations. In addition,\r\nwe understand that the responsibility for the fight against\r\ndrugs, which debase individuals and corrupt nations, lies not\r\nonly with the producer countries but primarily with those\r\nwhose consumption is greatest, often developed nations\r\nwhich, unfortunately, tend to feel that their actions should\r\nfocus only on the supply, beyond their borders, rather than\r\non the demand expressed within their own territories.\r\nInternational cooperation should also be expressed\r\nthrough cooperation in the fight against narcotrafficking, in\r\nthe form of reciprocal legal cooperation, exchanges of\r\ninformation among the competent authorities of each\r\ncountry, concerted operations among the services responsible\r\nfor implementing the laws, and periodic meetings allowing\r\nfor an interchange of experiences and analyses, and other\r\nsimilar activities.\r\nIn my country’s opinion, cooperation in this field is still\r\ninsufficient. We see with concern that all too often the will\r\nmanifested in agreements is not reflected in real cooperation.\r\nIn the field of drugs, unfortunately, a great deal is written\r\nand said but not much is done.\r\nWe believe that true cooperation is expressed in the\r\nfree flow of information on drug trafficking activities which\r\ninvolve more than one country, in the speedy delivery of\r\njudicial records and evidence which will hinder the impunity\r\nof the branches of illegal organizations which act in a\r\ndifferent country from the one in which the judicial\r\nproceedings are carried out, in concertation between the\r\npolice and control services for specific operations, in timely\r\nresponses to requests for information on suspects, and in a\r\nflexible handling of extradition requests. Because the enemy\r\nis powerful and enormously wealthy, the response of those\r\nof us who, by mandate of our peoples, represent the\r\ncommon good should be effective, speedy and aggressive.\r\nIn our judgement, the undeniable political will of our\r\ncountries to cooperate in the control of drug trafficking\r\nshould be reflected in our daily action. The situation does\r\nnot call for sporadic and occasional gestures but for\r\npersistent and continuous operations.\r\nThe Chilean State is prepared to do this. As many\r\ncountries have observed, we are already cooperating with\r\nother nations and particularly with our neighbours in the\r\nmost expeditious and flexible way, both in connection with\r\ndrug trafficking itself and with the trade and contraband of\r\ndrug-processing products, as well as with money laundering.\r\nWith the sponsorship of the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme, we hope in the immediate future\r\nto crete regional programmes on these matters.\r\nIn our country’s opinion, no contradiction should exist\r\nbetween international cooperation and national sovereignty.\r\nIf the rule of law and the legitimate political authorities of\r\neach country are respected, cooperation between our States\r\ncan be increased. But, we insist, it is essential that in these\r\nactivities the political, administrative and professional\r\nsovereignty of our nations be respected.\r\nIn concluding my statement, I wish to reiterate the firm\r\ndetermination of the Chilean State and Government to\r\nparticipate resolutely in the international community’s\r\nconcerted efforts to confront the production, abuse and illicit\r\ntraffic of drugs, under the principle of shared responsibility\r\nand in the framework of the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme.\r\nI would like to emphasize the urgent need to act on this\r\ntragic problem. The deaths, the physical and moral\r\ndestruction, the delinquency resulting from drugs and the\r\nsocial marginalization of addicts - all affect our countries\r\nwhether they are producers, processors and sellers of drugs,\r\nor intermediaries for drugs, including drug-processing\r\nproducts.\r\nMr. Baltasar Garzón, delegate of Spain’s National Drug\r\nPlan, who I understand is present at this plenary session,\r\nrecently asked in a newspaper article, \"In the fight against\r\ndrugs, now what?\" He is quite right. \"Now what?\", we are\r\nasked by the sick, the young and the poor of our peoples.\r\nDrugs: now what? The answer is up to us.\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 13\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Vice-President of the Republic of Bolivia,\r\nMr. Victor Hugo Cardenas.\r\nMr. Victor Hugo Cardenas, Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Bolivia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Vice-President of the Republic of Bolivia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Victor Hugo Cardenas, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. CARDENAS (Bolivia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I am pleased indeed to address this plenary\r\nmeeting to consider aspects of international cooperation in\r\nthe control of narcotic drugs.\r\nThe presence of distinguished personalities from\r\nMember States highlights the importance of this forum; our\r\nOrganization seems at last to have resolved to deal in depth\r\nwith the question of international cooperation in the search\r\nfor solutions to the serious problems posed by the causes\r\nand effects of demand, consumption, production, and illicit\r\ntrafficking of narcotic drugs.\r\nThis is undoubtedly a difficult topic, especially for\r\ncountries like mine which suffer the consequences of drug\r\ntrafficking not by any will of their own but through the\r\ninfluence of those who, in other places, amass fortunes from\r\nthis reprehensible activity.\r\nAccordingly, we are discouraged to see that our efforts\r\noften do not prompt the solidarity from the international\r\ncommunity, which should be expressed by substantial\r\ncontributions to combating this evil.\r\nBolivia has a Master Plan for Prevention, Control of\r\nIllicit Drug Trafficking and Alternative Development.\r\nPrevention, control and development are the three\r\nfoundations for combating drug trafficking and its\r\nconsequences, and this threefold approach must be supported\r\nin every way if it is to yield results in the fight against drug\r\ntrafficking.\r\nI must acknowledge that, in my country, the policy of\r\nprevention is perhaps the weakest, owing to the shortage of\r\nhuman and financial resources to implement the new\r\nNational Plan for reduction of drug demand in Bolivia,\r\nadopted in 1993. However, some goals have been met with\r\nthe support of public and private Bolivian and foreign\r\norganizations addressing educational tasks and rehabilitation\r\nin specialized clinics in the country’s major cities.\r\nThe policy of illicit drug traffic control has probably\r\nbeen the most successful, for it has succeeded in containing\r\nthe growth of that activity. Over the last eight years we\r\nhave seized nearly 90,000 kilograms of illicit drugs at\r\nvarious stages of processing. Similarly, more than 400\r\nfactories have been destroyed, and the principal kingpins of\r\norganized drug crime have been detained, tried and\r\npunished.\r\nThe policy of alternative development, originally aimed\r\nat replacing surplus coca plantations with other crops, has\r\nbeen planned with a broader perspective, based on the need\r\nto transform a whole economy driven largely by coca and its\r\nderivatives into a different kind of economy, one based on\r\nnew lines of production that serve to generate jobs, incomes\r\nand foreign exchange, in a framework of balanced and\r\nsustained economic and social growth.\r\nIn order to replace the coca economy, it has been\r\nnecessary to supplement the concept of alternative\r\ndevelopment, gradually moving into other priority areas of\r\nthe national economy, that is, to expand the concept to one\r\nof sustainable development and human development.\r\nMore effective reduction of coca shrubs cannot be\r\nachieved only by means of law enforcement, nor has the\r\npromise of granting cash incentives for each hectare\r\ndestroyed been sufficient - witness the traumatic experience\r\nof my country, the second-ranking coca producer in the\r\nworld. After cutting surplus plantings by half, at a high\r\nsocial cost, we are discouraged to note that the increase in\r\nthe consumption of narcotics in the developed societies is in\r\nthe same proportion as the increase in the poverty of my\r\npeople.\r\nFor my country, a true solution must derive from a\r\nstrategy to eradicate the poverty that affects more than two\r\nthirds of the population, particularly those living in\r\nindigenous and rural areas and in city outskirts. That is the\r\ncontext in which the macroeconomic targets and social goals\r\nhave been defined by Bolivia’s new administration, whose\r\naim is to modernize the State while bringing about\r\nfar-reaching reform in institutional machinery. That reform\r\nseeks to strengthen and expand democracy, to preserve our\r\nhard-won economic stability, and to reduce poverty.\r\nRecently, President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada\r\nproposed a strategy under which surplus coca production\r\ncould be replaced, not through enforced eradication, but\r\nthrough the alternative means of sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment associated with productive diversification and\r\ngreater access to world markets, not only for agricultural\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nproducts but also for manufactured goods with greater value\r\nadded.\r\nPursuing those broad lines of action over the medium\r\nterm necessarily requires international cooperation with two\r\nobjectives: support for physical infrastructure works in\r\ncoca-producing areas, and vigorous support for\r\nagro-industrial development programmes in those areas.\r\nWe in Bolivia are convinced of the need to promote\r\nefficiency in social investment designed to reduce poverty.\r\nTaking that approach, we will forge ahead with a policy to\r\nfoster investments that enhance productive employment and\r\nthe commitment to bringing the most vulnerable strata of\r\nsociety into the mainstream.\r\nThe Rio Group, holding its seventh presidential summit\r\nin Santiago, Chile, expressed disappointment at the attitude\r\nof the great industrial Powers, which is further weakening\r\nthe multilateral trade system and affecting the delicate\r\nequilibrium of the trade balance of the countries concerned.\r\nThe Presidents reaffirmed their fight against illicit\r\nproduction, trafficking and consumption of narcotic drugs\r\nand psychotropic substances, as well as their condemnation\r\nof terrorism, because both constitute a systematic and\r\ndeliberate violation of human rights. In that same spirit,\r\nthey noted the need for increased international cooperation\r\nwithin a framework of responsibility shared between the\r\ncountries affected by production and those characterized by\r\nhigh drug use.\r\nI wish to refer also to other recent directions taken by\r\nthe major economic Powers.\r\nWe have noted answers and explanations that seek to\r\njustify the new policy of reallocating a part of the funds\r\nearmarked for this campaign, diverting them to other\r\npurposes in various parts of the world. This reallocation\r\ncould prompt a dangerous set-back, leading to the\r\nelimination of programmes that are under way. In that\r\nevent, instead of support for projects with indigenous peasant\r\ncommunities, providing technological resources and\r\neducation in order to achieve greater grass-roots\r\nparticipation, there could occur a negative backlash, as those\r\ncommunities could very well perceive commitments to\r\ncooperation as lacking in seriousness. That works to the\r\ndetriment of Bolivia and of all countries involved in this\r\nstruggle against the odds.\r\nAllow me to say that the damage will be greatest to\r\nindigenous peoples, whose International Year is being\r\nmarked in 1993, for it is they who are the first to suffer the\r\nimpact of these reductions. In this regard, I must report that\r\nthe Bolivian Government, together with others, is sponsoring\r\nthe declaration of the international decade of the world’s\r\nindigenous peoples, a period during which issues central to\r\ntheir future and progress should be addressed.\r\nIn my capacity as representative of Bolivia and of the\r\nfounding peoples of my country, I consider it a privilege to\r\nuphold before the conscience of the international community\r\nthe right of those peoples to recognition of their historical\r\nand cultural integrity as a fundamental and integral part of\r\nStates.\r\nIt is my duty to address an appeal to the conscience of\r\nthe most powerful countries that they not close their eyes to\r\nthat situation. Bolivia has assumed its share of\r\nresponsibility, with great effort and sacrifice, despite its\r\nshortage of resources. Since 1985 we have contributed\r\nsignificantly to international endeavours to combat drugs,\r\nthrough a model of our own based on protection of domestic\r\npeace, community participation, alternative development, and\r\ndemocratic stability.\r\nThe insufficiency and inadequate execution of many of\r\nthe programmes carried out on the demand side have meant\r\nthat the efforts exerted by countries like my own have lost\r\nthe effectiveness needed to achieve satisfactory overall\r\nresults.\r\nWe understand that there are problems in many parts of\r\nthe world which call for urgent assistance, but we are\r\nconvinced that priorities should be geared to consolidating\r\nand enhancing the efficiency of existing programmes and\r\nmachinery in the fight against drug trafficking.\r\nI cannot fail to mention the negotiations with the\r\nDublin Group of countries. We reiterate our appeal that the\r\nvaluable help, now hampered by slow and complex approval\r\nmachinery, be made more dynamic. Their aid is essential\r\nfor financial and technical support of anti-drug programmes\r\nin our countries.\r\nMy Government is convinced of the need to strengthen\r\nmultilateral mechanisms. We see the strengthening of these\r\nprogrammes as an outcome of this important event.\r\nMy Government expresses its gratitude and its support\r\nfor the important task that is being carried out by Mr.\r\nGiorgio Giacomelli, Executive Director of the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme.\r\nWe are faced with a great paradox: although mankind\r\nhas created unprecedented conditions for scientific and\r\ntechnological development, poverty and the inability to\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 15\r\ntackle the basic problems of four fifths of the world’s\r\npopulation are growing steadily. The illegality of the\r\nprocesses linked to the production, trafficking and\r\nconsumption of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances\r\nis contributing dangerously to that dramatic gap.\r\nThe time has therefore come for a careful review of the\r\norientation of the strategies and policies we have shared in\r\nrecent years. It is up to us to provide remedies to these\r\nevils and to shoulder our responsibility with optimism and\r\nresolve for our societies and future generations.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Bolivia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Victor Hugo Cardenas, Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Bolivia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Mrs. Simone Veil,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Social Affairs,\r\nHealth and Urban Planning of France.\r\nMrs. VEIL (France) (interpretation from French): We\r\nare gathered here for a meeting of extraordinary importance.\r\nThree years after the special session of the General\r\nAssembly in February 1990, we are taking stock of action\r\ntaken in an attempt to chart, in the light of that review, new\r\nways to make our action more effective if need be.\r\nAt first glance, the picture seems extremely gloomy. A\r\nFrench weekly recently had a headline on this subject that\r\nread \"Drugs: the lost war?\" Have we really reached that\r\npoint?\r\nI do not believe that it is possible to assert that the war\r\non drugs has already been lost and has therefore become\r\npointless, but I agree that it is indeed a war, which now has\r\nthe planet for its theatre and poverty as its prop. We used\r\nto speak in terms of very limited areas. That is no longer\r\nthe case. The consuming North was set against the\r\nproducing South. The situation has changed considerably.\r\nEveryone is affected now, and everyone bears a share of\r\nresponsibility, great or small. There are now countries of\r\nthe North producing cannabis, while in the South the\r\ngeography of production is in perpetual flux.\r\nThe scourge is also striking the transit countries,\r\nthemselves afflicted by the porosity inherent in these\r\nnetworks of corruption; the trade routes of drug trafficking\r\nfollow the lines of least political, economic and social\r\nresistance.\r\nMoreover, the range of narcotic drugs has expanded.\r\nHuge pharmaceutical laboratories offer a whole gamut of\r\nproducts, amphetamines or hallucinogens, which are illegally\r\nexported to the poor countries.\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThese realities highlight even more the destabilizing\r\nnature of the illicit traffic in drugs at the geopolitical level.\r\nThe inclusion of a country in the drug traffic network soon\r\nentails, the exacerbation of all types of social problems for\r\nthat country. In this respect, I should like to draw attention\r\nto the particularly alarming situation of Africa. That\r\ncontinent, where certain ports and airports serve as transit\r\npoints, is currently under the greatest threat, while the efforts\r\nof the major United Nations agencies trying to deal with the\r\nproblem are still concentrating too much on other parts of\r\nthe world. For Africa, the \"war on drugs\" must henceforth\r\nbe a part of all assistance and cooperation programmes\r\napproved or financed by the development agencies, whether\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the World\r\nBank or bilateral assistance programmes.\r\nThe increase in drug trafficking naturally implies a\r\ncorresponding increase in demand. The number of illicit\r\nconsumers of narcotic drugs continues to grow throughout\r\nthe world. It is expanding rapidly in the countries of the\r\nSouth, adding an additional evil to the social problems of\r\nevery type that already plague those societies. The tragic\r\nproblem of the spread of the AIDS pandemic is further\r\naggravated by drug addiction and inadequate prevention in\r\nthat area. It is no longer a question of a scourge limited to\r\nrich countries and populations seeking new thrills in\r\nresponse to society’s shortcomings; today, we are all\r\naffected. The result of this exacerbated situation is the\r\ndazzling wealth of the drug trade. The turnover, estimated\r\nat $500 billion, is over four times the gross national product\r\nof the 53 least developed countries.\r\nThe challenge is therefore global and the stakes are\r\nhigh. We are dealing with the very future of our societies,\r\nabove all because the main target of the drug trade\r\neverywhere is young people - and that target population is\r\nbecoming ever younger. In France the average age of the\r\ncannabis consumer is 22; of the heroin consumer, 26; and of\r\nthe cocaine consumer, 28. As if that did not make the\r\npicture bleak enough, it is further darkened by the ravages\r\nof AIDS among drug addicts. Indeed, we cannot\r\nunderestimate the importance of that factor in the spread of\r\nthe HIV virus.\r\nConsiderable energy, therefore, must be dedicated to\r\nthis struggle. Determination and unflagging effort are the\r\nkeys to success. They must be absolute. That is why we\r\nmust be extremely careful not to yield in a fight which some\r\nconsider already lost nor to give into the temptation to be\r\ndefeatist. The situation is too serious to throw up our hands\r\nin resignation.\r\nBut does this mean that we have done nothing in three\r\nyears, that the picture should make us despair? Some\r\nglimmers of hope exist. Let us review them.\r\nFirst, awareness of extent of the challenge has\r\nconsiderably increased. Some debates that were until\r\nrecently considered controversial now seem to be over - for\r\ninstance, the difference between the countries of the North,\r\nrightly obsessed with the question of supply, and the\r\ncountries of the South, inclined to consider that the problem\r\nwas above all one for the rich, and that it was up to them to\r\nsettle it. Some parts of the debate about sovereignty also\r\nseem obsolete. We have had to accept the reality of the\r\nworld of the drug dealers, who scorn national frontiers and\r\nlegislation.\r\nIt seems to me, therefore, that if we have yet to\r\nmeasure up to the challenge, we are better placed to do so,\r\nprimarily because we have acquired potentially very\r\neffective legal tools. At the national level, first, countries\r\nhave begun to react. In France, for instance, we have\r\nadopted an arsenal of regulations and legislation to deal with\r\nthe problem. In particular, we have acquired the means to\r\nfight money laundering. At the administrative level, we\r\nhave established an interministerial coordination body, the\r\nDelegation General for the War on Drugs and Addiction,\r\nunder my authority as Minister for Social Affairs and Health.\r\nEvery ministry involved is represented. We have also\r\nconsiderably increased the financial resources devoted to the\r\nwar on drug abuse.\r\nDrugs threaten the very existence of our societies. But\r\nit is wrong to imagine that repressive solutions alone will\r\nenable us to resolve such a complex problem, which though\r\nit very much concerns the public authorities, concerns no\r\nless the individual and his personal behaviour, his health and\r\nhis social and family relationships. This phenomenon,\r\nwhose consequences are tragic, is so complex that all its\r\ndimensions must be grasped if our preventive measures are\r\nto be truly effective.\r\nWe cannot ignore the pressures drug dealers put on\r\npotential consumers or the trap that closes on petty dealers,\r\nwho, having sought to make easy money, end up becoming\r\nconsumers themselves. But these things do not explain\r\neverything. We need to ask ourselves why young people\r\nseek in the high or the apathy induced by drugs a way to\r\nescape from reality. Is it a crisis of identity inherent in\r\nmodern societies; a loss of traditional values and taboos; a\r\nflight from a future darkened by economic crises and\r\nconstant social change?\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 17\r\nWhatever the cause, public authorities must make a\r\nspecial effort to adapt prevention to specific sectors of\r\nsociety. Experience teaches us that a message on prevention\r\nhas meaning only in terms of the target ages and groups. It\r\nmust be drawn up with the help of those who specialize in\r\nthe areas concerned: psychologists, sociologists and\r\nteachers. That has been France’s aim under my authority,\r\nwith the provision of better care for the sick in order to\r\nreintegrate the greatest possible number of them into society.\r\nOn the international level, the 1988 United Nations\r\nConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\r\nPsychotropic Substances has entered into force. Eighty\r\nStates have now ratified it. I appeal for the broadest\r\npossible ratification of the Convention.\r\nBut ratification is not enough. We must be stricter in\r\nensuring that we respect our commitments under the\r\nConvention. Through the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme (UNDCP), the United Nations is making\r\npraiseworthy efforts to promote full and comprehensive\r\nimplementation of the Convention and to create on the local\r\nlevel a climate favouring respect for those commitments.\r\nThe Organization is also engaged in improving the\r\nenvironment, including the legal and administrative\r\nenvironment, necessary for such cooperation to succeed.\r\nEven that is not enough. We expect UNDCP to be\r\nmore self-motivated on this essential subject. Each year, the\r\nExecutive Director of UNDCP should report fully on the\r\nProgramme’s activities: its successes and its failures alike.\r\nFor the benefit of countries that have made serious efforts to\r\nimplement the Convention, especially developing countries,\r\nit should also recommend positive measures in terms of\r\naccess to international credits from major international or\r\nregional development or financing agencies.\r\nBut we need to go further. I suggest that our experts\r\nget right to work on ways of strengthening means of\r\nmonitoring and implementing the 1988 Convention, possibly\r\nthrough a protocol that would establish a forum that could\r\nimpose penalties or, in the last resort, sanctions. This\r\nwould, of course, require a considerable but, in our view,\r\nnecessary broadening of the purview of the International\r\nNarcotics Control Board.\r\nUNDCP, founded only two years ago, aroused great\r\nexpectations among Member States and contributing States,\r\nand it continues to do so. Under the effective guidance of\r\nMr. Giacomelli, it is beginning to achieve results. But we\r\nare still far from the target. First UNDCP needs a\r\nsubstantial increase in the funds made available to it by\r\nStates.\r\nThe Programme must also act with determination and\r\nauthority in the areas of its competence; it must firmly\r\nreassert its purpose of coordinating activities carried out\r\nelsewhere, within and outside the United Nations system. It\r\nmust work on a more regular basis with the International\r\nCriminal Police Organization (INTERPOL); there has been\r\nmuch progress, but that cooperation must be made even\r\ncloser, while respecting the autonomy of both organizations.\r\nAbove all, we must avoid institutional proliferation,\r\nwhich can impair the effectiveness of our struggle. We must\r\ncut through the undergrowth of existing bodies, a task to\r\nwhich I hope the Commission on Narcotic Drugs will devote\r\nits attention. France will submit a document containing\r\nspecific proposals on this matter.\r\nUNDCP must also be ever ready for new fields of\r\naction, three of which I view as deserving special priority.\r\nThe first relates to investigating the financial networks\r\nused by drug traffickers: the fight against money laundering.\r\nSeveral States, including France, already have the legislative\r\nmeans to do this; very effective cooperation has been\r\nestablished within the framework of the Financial Action\r\nTask-Force on Money Laundering. Similar structures are\r\nbeing established in every region. Now is the time to ensure\r\noverall consistency, a task which could fall to UNDCP.\r\nUNDCP should also be responsible for the dissemination of\r\ntechnological expertise for early identification of zones of\r\nproduction and transit points. Surveillance by satellite and\r\nfinding means of monitoring more effectively the tens of\r\nthousands of containers that pass daily through the world’s\r\nports are interesting ideas, and France would consider\r\nproviding firm support and stepping up its cooperation.\r\nThe second field of action is the priority area of\r\nprevention. Too often, suppression and prevention are\r\nviewed as incompatible. But a policy for a war on illicit\r\ndrugs can be based only on both those two priorities. The\r\nFrench Government understands this complementarity and\r\nhas decided to set up a commission composed not of experts\r\nbut of \"wise men\" open to considering societal problems;\r\nthis commission is charged with studying the problems -\r\nsocial, economic and medical problems of course, but also\r\nbroader ethical and even philosophical problems - that the\r\nphenomenon of drug addiction raises for our country.\r\nThe same must be done, in a scaled-up version, on an\r\ninternational level. UNDCP must do more to collect data on\r\nthe most affected categories, on the motivations of those\r\ninvolved, and on experiments throughout the world to take\r\nimmediate action to increase awareness among children and\r\nyouth and to provide adequate treatment.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nWill those measures suffice? Clearly not. At best, we\r\ncan stem the evil more or less effectively. The situation\r\ndemands that we explore a third field of action. In some\r\ncountries, the fight against the production and trafficking in\r\nillicit drugs is a question of survival for the State - drug\r\ndealers have infiltrated too deeply and too widely - and has\r\ncaused too severe an institutional gangrene, especially among\r\nthe guarantors of the rule of law, such as the judiciary and\r\nthe police, for those countries to achieve a solution on their\r\nown, whatever their determination to do so. I am thinking\r\nof situations where drug trafficking circles have allied\r\nthemselves with terrorist movements which they equip and\r\nfinance an attempt to destabilize regimes that dare to oppose\r\ntheir domination.\r\nI propose that together, without excluding any\r\npossibilities, we think about creating specific machinery to\r\nfocus action on limited-duration bilateral and multilateral\r\nplans to solve the problem. Such exceptional action, of\r\ncourse, could take place only at the request of the country\r\ninvolved. It could include cooperation strengthened by the\r\nassignment of specialized police personnel, and should also\r\ninvolve the major international financial institutions and the\r\nmain organization of the United Nations system.\r\nOur struggle will not be won in a year or in five years.\r\nWe are talking about an entire decade. But it is urgent that\r\nwe move to respond, and that we put aside our differences,\r\ngiven the dimensions of the challenge before us all.\r\nI can affirm that France will always stand by the side\r\nof the international community in this struggle. In this\r\nmobilization, international and French public opinion will\r\nguarantee our victory. For the very foundations of our\r\nsocieties are at stake. In the nineteenth century, the\r\ninternational community managed to respond effectively to\r\npiracy. In a very different and perhaps even more difficult\r\ncontext, we need to find a common response commensurate\r\nwith this new and terrible challenge. I have no doubt that\r\nwe shall be able to do so.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call now on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Senator Antonino Murmura, Under-Secretary of\r\nState, Ministry of the Interior of Italy.\r\nMr. MURMURA (Italy) (spoke in Italian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): I am very pleased to address\r\nthe General Assembly on behalf of the Italian Government\r\nand the Minister of Interior of Italy on the occasion of these\r\nplenary meetings devoted to the drug problem, one of the\r\nmost serious evils affecting today’s society.\r\nI realize that there is no sure cure for a global and\r\ncomplex problem such as the one of drug abuse, and I am\r\nconvinced that there is an urgent need to devise operational\r\ntools and formulas in step with a fast-changing reality;\r\nnevertheless, I am equally aware that this discussion must be\r\nbased upon concrete matters: on the guidelines and on the\r\nmeans to be put to common use if our Government\r\ninstitutions are to give an adequate response to this common\r\nthreat.\r\nMy opinion is still that it is not enough to agree upon\r\ncooperation measures, by means of conventions, bilateral\r\nagreements, and political accords of a different nature, if\r\nsuch agreements are not coupled with consistent behaviour\r\nand a precise fulfilment of the obligations agreed upon.\r\nFor this reason, Italy has actively participated in the\r\ncreation of a common international drug legislation and has\r\nsigned all the relevant United Nations Conventions.\r\nItaly has been supporting the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), which it\r\nconsiders to be the natural forum effectively to combat\r\ndrugs. Lately, the UNDCP has improved its autonomy in\r\nthe management of financial and human resources with the\r\naim of achieving more successful results.\r\nIt is therefore necessary for the international community\r\nto afford to UNDCP all possible technical and financial\r\nresources so that the common goals claimed by the highest\r\nauthorities are not frustrated at the most crucial moments,\r\nthat is to say whenever we are to produce specific actions\r\nand tangible results.\r\nIt is now a common conviction that the only way to\r\nfight this phenomenon is through increased, consistent\r\ncooperation, particularly in two areas: the project against\r\nmoney laundering and the project against drug trafficking by\r\nsea.\r\nWith regard to money laundering, the 40\r\nrecommendations of the Financial Action Task Force must\r\nbe considered and adapted to various national legislations.\r\nTo this end we need to create a network of shared\r\ninstruments and of mutual investigative and legal assistance.\r\nThe suppression of drug-trafficking by sea is\r\nparticularly important for Italy, and we feel there is a need\r\nto establish, especially in these fields, effective cooperation\r\nwith other countries which share this opinion with us.\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 19\r\nFurthermore, a draft convention of the Council of\r\nEurope to implement article 17 is being studied by a panel\r\nof experts chaired by Italy.\r\nAlong the same lines, Italy is also setting up a\r\ncomputerized system to exchange information on drug\r\ntrafficking, the so-called Teledrug. Teledrug will operate\r\nuninterrupted around the clock and will enhance the\r\ncapabilities of drug enforcement in participating countries\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations Conventions.\r\nThe United Nations Conventions, the 1987\r\nComprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline, and the 1990\r\nGlobal Programme of Action are the cornerstones of Italy’s\r\ndrug law, which takes into equal consideration the need to\r\ncombat narcotic drug trafficking as well as drug abuse\r\nprevention, and treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts\r\nto whom we should be devoting more attention.\r\nI should like to make clear that, although the result of\r\nthe Italian referendum of 18 April has eliminated prison\r\nsentences for the possession of drugs for personal use, it has,\r\nhowever, upheld the principle that possession is illegal and\r\npunishable by administrative sanctions.\r\nItalians have shown their dislike for past legislation on\r\ndrugs but this absolutely does not imply the liberalization of\r\ndrug use or drug dealing.\r\nThe drug phenomenon should not be seen as an isolated\r\nphenomenon. We must not ignore the complex ties between\r\ndrug trafficking and other criminal activities, first and\r\nforemost, money laundering and, more generally, organized\r\ncrime. Moreover we must not ignore the connection\r\nbetween drug trafficking and arms smuggling.\r\nThe same strategy of international cooperation that must\r\nguide the war on drugs should also shape the methods we\r\nuse to fight money laundering and arms smuggling. We\r\nshall fight them equally energetically. Italy’s laws against\r\nthese phenomena are particularly severe and detailed. We\r\nhope other States will base their drug laws upon these\r\nprinciples in order to create a common front of law\r\nenforcement to combat the transnational activities of\r\norganized crime.\r\nThat is why I must express my concerns over the\r\ngrowing trend towards legalizing drugs and the fatalistic\r\nattitude that the war against drugs is a \"lost cause\". I\r\nbelieve these attitudes could be very dangerous because they\r\nmay weaken our commitment against narcotic drugs\r\ntrafficking and against the other problems I have already\r\nmentioned.\r\nOn the contrary, we should be addressing drug\r\ntrafficking, money laundering and arms smuggling as three\r\ndifferent aspects of the same criminal activity carried out by\r\ninternational organized crime which day by day is becoming\r\nmore relentless and ferocious.\r\nTherefore this should not be for us the moment for\r\ndiscouragement and disengagement, but rather it should be\r\nthe moment to renew and enhance our determination in this\r\nwar which should also be fuelled by the positive results\r\nachieved in recent times in drug suppression, thanks to\r\ncloser international cooperation between police forces and\r\njudicial authorities.\r\nIn Italy, better domestic coordination of law\r\nenforcement agencies, increased cooperation with the\r\nspecialized agencies of other countries, and the adoption of\r\nnew techniques envisaged by the new drug law, such as\r\ncontrolled deliveries and undercover purchases, have led in\r\nthe past three years to successful results which were never\r\npossible in the past.\r\nWe intend to continue along these lines, by\r\nstrengthening legal instruments, increasing the number of\r\ndrug liaison officers posted abroad, and enhancing controls\r\nto combat the diversion of precursor chemicals to illicit\r\nproduction.\r\nItaly also wishes to reiterate its confidence in the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, first, to UNDCP\r\nand its Executive Director, Ambassador Giacomelli, and\r\nexpresses its utmost dislike of those initiatives designed to\r\nlimit its autonomy, efficiency and management.\r\nFrom the very outset UNDCP has adopted a\r\nwell-balanced global strategy with which Italy fully agrees.\r\nIt is clear that only by working on the one hand to reduce\r\ndrug demand and supply and on the other hand to suppress\r\ndrug trafficking can we hope to obtain genuine results.\r\nItaly finds particularly interesting the initiative started\r\nby UNDCP to involve more actively the non-governmental\r\norganizations, the voluntary workers, the media, the private\r\nsector, local institutions and the international sports\r\nmovement in common action.\r\nIn particular, Italy hopes that international financial\r\ninstitutions will be involved in common efforts for an\r\nalternative development such as substituting the cultivation\r\nof drug crops because so far they have shown little interest\r\nin this social aspect of the drug problem.\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nTo the problem of alternative development as well as\r\nthe achievement of a common United Nations strategy to\r\ncombat drugs, we intend to direct our proposal, which I am\r\nhonoured to present on this occasion on behalf of the Italian\r\nGovernment, to organize in Italy a United Nations world\r\nconference on drugs with particular emphasis on heroin. It\r\nwill take place in the first half of 1996 and will be a\r\nfollow-up to the Conference that was held in London in\r\nApril 1990.\r\nWe said that there is no sure remedy to the drug\r\nproblem; so we should consider all the difficulties and\r\nproblems posed by illicit drug abuse to individuals,\r\ncommunities and Governments at all levels. This approach\r\nshould be based upon our great respect for life and for\r\nhuman beings.\r\nWithin this framework Italy believes we should work\r\nfor a common, deep and detailed study of the drug problem,\r\nto share experience, to make efforts at both domestic and\r\ninternational levels in a spirit of genuine solidarity and\r\nmutual assistance which Italy deems necessary to guarantee\r\nto us all, and especially to the generations of the young, a\r\nfuture of dignity and civilized progress as outlined in the\r\nCharter that established the United Nations.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on His Excellency,\r\nMr. Baltasar Garzón Real of Spain, delegate of the\r\nGovernment for the National Drug Plan.\r\nMr. GARZON REAL (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I wish to begin by congratulating you,\r\nMr. President, on the way in which you are conducting these\r\nhigh-level plenary meetings on drugs. For me, it is a great\r\nhonour to have the opportunity to speak at this rostrum.\r\nI wish to express my delegation’s support for the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Belgium on behalf\r\nof the States members of the European Community.\r\nThe United Nations is the most appropriate forum for\r\ndiscussion of an issue that affects so many countries and\r\nshould be approached from the perspective of its general\r\nimpact. The drug problem is a world-wide issue involving\r\nthe countries that produce drugs, those that process them,\r\nthose that operate as transit points and those in which drugs\r\nare consumed. Moreover, the issue is complex in terms of\r\nharmful effects: drugs destroy their victims, generate petty\r\ncrime and felonies, encourage the undermining of society\r\nand enable those who profit from them to dominate\r\nsegments of society and to gain power by buying or\r\ncorrupting free will.\r\nTo combat this world-wide and complex phenomenon,\r\nwe must abandon local solutions that underestimate the\r\nmagnitude of the problem and are based on the mistaken\r\nidea that drugs are produced by others and that we are the\r\nones who suffer. But we must not forget that, first, it is\r\nnecessary for States to coordinate their own efforts and\r\npolicies so that, once the structure is firm, we may be able\r\nto achieve wider coordination. Only a coordinated structure\r\nat the very basis will make it possible, with the support and\r\nleadership of the United Nations, to give the police and the\r\njudicial authorities more scope for action and make possible\r\nthe development of intelligent policies to deal with those\r\nengaged in organized crime whose main activity is drug\r\ntrafficking and laundering the profits thereof.\r\nThe need for our common determination to lead to\r\ncoordinated responses should pervade our cool thinking\r\nabout the current state of the problem. The time has come\r\nto pause and meditate on the solutions that should be\r\nadopted. I intend to advocate, in my country, the opening of\r\na general debate to evaluate what has been achieved and to\r\nthink about the future. We should come to this debate\r\nwithout any preconceived ideas or immovable dogmas. We\r\nmust be open to the exchange of ideas.\r\nA similar process of reflection, within and from the\r\nUnited Nations, would be appropriate. This proposal is\r\nbased on the conviction that the United Nations is the most\r\nappropriate forum and the optimum sounding-board for an\r\nexchange of ideas and for the adoption of decisions on new\r\nlines of action that would help us achieve our objectives. I\r\nshould like to stress here the role of the Commission on\r\nNarcotic Drugs, which is the main policy-making body of\r\nthe United Nations in the field of drug control.\r\nThe strategies to combat the production of and\r\ntrafficking in drugs should complement and be integrated\r\ninto programmes to reduce demand. Efforts in a single area\r\nof activity cannot be effective, as they result in our losing\r\nsight of the need for a global approach. Hence, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary that there be determined support for\r\ngeneral prevention programmes that engender an authentic\r\nculture of the rejection of drugs in their broadest sense. But\r\nit must not be forgotten that prevention has to include\r\navoidance of the dangers of organized crime - a problem that\r\nit is essential we combat resolutely and intelligently.\r\nOn the other hand, with regard to drug consumption, it\r\nmust be recognized that a drug addict should be regarded not\r\nas a criminal but as someone who is ill. Drug consumption\r\nshould therefore be dealt with by administrative penalty -\r\nnever by criminal action. Appropriate rehabilitation should\r\nbe made available to enable the addict to be reintegrated into\r\nsociety. My country applies this policy so that, with the\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 21\r\ncooperation of all the relevant public institutions and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, such recovery may be\r\nachieved. On this front, it is necessary also to have\r\ncoordinated policies that are as broadly based as possible.\r\nWe are developing a series of measures to ensure that drug\r\naddicts receive proper help from health and social services,\r\non an equal footing with other citizens. Throughout the country -\r\nat the regional and local levels - we have a network of\r\nassistance resources.\r\nSpain’s National Drug Plan incorporates these different\r\nlevels, and there is an input from public resources and from\r\nflexible and dynamic non-governmental organizations with\r\na view to achieving more positive results in the rehabilitation\r\nof drug addicts and of their families and social settings and\r\nto provide some solutions for those who are dependent on\r\ndrugs. In Spain, as in many other countries, the most\r\nserious health problems of drug consumers are those that\r\nresult from HIV infection. Preventive measures to reduce\r\nthe practice of injecting drugs are essential if the spread of\r\nthis infection is to be controlled. As drugs are a social\r\nscourge, it is essential that society be actively involved in\r\nsolving the problem. Otherwise, any policy will fail.\r\nImplementation of the Global Programme of Action in\r\nMember States requires ongoing encouragement at the\r\ninternational level and a firm commitment from every\r\ncountry. To this end, the recommendations contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report are an invaluable guide.\r\nMy country has been following actively the process of\r\nmodifying the United Nations structures in the field of drugs.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), as well as\r\nthe consolidation of an appropriate administrative structure.\r\nThis consolidation should enable UNDCP and its Executive\r\nDirector, to whom we again express our support and esteem,\r\nto discharge fully their function of coordinating international\r\nactivities in this field, while ensuring flexible and effective\r\nmanagement.\r\nThere remains the challenge of ensuring that the\r\ncatalyst of the UNDCP will penetrate the United Nations\r\nsystem. In the present decade, the involvement of other\r\nagencies and the cooperation of international financial\r\ninstitutions, including provisions in their programmes and\r\nactivities aimed at preventing the production of, trafficking\r\nin and consumption of drugs, are indispensable.\r\nThe need for new approaches in the fight against drugs\r\nmust extend to the control of drug trafficking. We must\r\nprovide ourselves with the most suitable legal instruments\r\nand the best human and material resources. The response to\r\nthe activities of organized crime must match the complexity\r\nof its schemes. We must consider resorting to collaborators,\r\ninformers, infiltrations, witness protection programmes, the\r\nmonitoring of deliveries and international police and judicial\r\ncooperation, and we must work towards adopting standards\r\nin this respect. Hence it will be necessary to improve\r\ncoordination between the UNDCP and the United Nations\r\ncrime prevention and criminal justice programme.\r\nHowever, success in the fight against drug trafficking\r\ncannot be bought at the cost of respect for fundamental\r\nrights. However complex the problem, Governments must\r\nnot resort to criminal activity as a justification for violating\r\nthe rules of democracy or the human rights of individuals.\r\nThere is no reason of State greater than the democratic\r\nreason of its citizens.\r\nMy country, as a member of the European Community\r\nand the Council of Europe, is prepared to cooperate now and\r\nin the immediate future because it understands the gravity of\r\nthe drug phenomenon. It will therefore actively support the\r\nCommunity’s policy and always promote policies devised in\r\nbroad consensus with other countries.\r\nThe Maastricht Treaty, which will soon come into\r\nforce, will require greater European cooperation in the fight\r\nagainst drugs. My country, as a member of the European\r\nCommunities, is prepared to cooperate actively towards the\r\nattainment of that objective. At the same time Spain will\r\npursue its efforts to cooperate with the countries of Latin\r\nAmerica and North Africa in facing up to such complex\r\nchallenges as those presented here, nurturing the right to free\r\nand democratic development and the establishment of more\r\njust and equitable international economic relations. We must\r\nnot forget that the countries affected must be offered\r\nalternative solutions and resolute support so that they can\r\nface the problem.\r\nThe results achieved at these meetings will have my\r\nGovernment’s attention, and I am sure that the Commission\r\non Narcotic Drugs will take into account the work that lies\r\nahead of us. The Commission on Narcotic Drugs must be\r\nthe forum in which the initiatives here identified - such as\r\nthe one most rightly proposed by Mexico - are developed,\r\nand in which all countries have the opportunity to express\r\ntheir concerns and receive a suitable response.\r\nThe magnitude of the drug problem, which is becoming\r\nquite clear in the course of this debate, demands the firm\r\nand concerted action of all members of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Torben Lund, Minister of Health of Denmark.\r\nMr. LUND (Denmark): First of all I should like to\r\nendorse fully the statement made earlier today by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Melchior Wathelet, Deputy Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Justice and Economic Affairs of Belgium,\r\non behalf of the European Community and its Member\r\nStates.\r\nLike other delegates I wish also to make a brief\r\nnational statement.\r\nThe fight against drug-related crime continues to be a\r\ntask of high priority for the Danish police. Considerable\r\nresources are used to fight drug crime at the national level,\r\nand the Danish police play an active role in the\r\ncomprehensive international cooperation which takes place\r\nboth within the European Community and outside it.\r\nBut in Denmark we are very much aware that law\r\nenforcement alone will not curb the increase in drug crimes.\r\nDecisive weight should be given to a coordinated and\r\nbalanced effort which comprises law enforcement and\r\ninitiatives in both the social sector and the health sector.\r\nDevelopments in the drug area over the past few years\r\ncall for a reconsideration of priorities. In Denmark we have\r\ndiscussed how best to use the considerable resources which\r\nare spent in the fight against illicit drugs.\r\nDevelopments over the past few years have shown that\r\neven a comprehensive law-enforcement strategy will not by\r\nitself solve the problem of illicit drugs. Moreover, police\r\ncampaigns have been seen to have certain adverse effects.\r\nAmong these are increased profits for the men behind\r\norganized drug crime and further degradation of life\r\nconditions among the people who are caught up in drug\r\nabuse.\r\nTherefore, I believe that we have reached the point\r\nwhere we must realize that there is a need for new\r\napproaches to the drug problem. I am not referring to the\r\nlegalization of the non-medical use of drugs. Regarding this\r\nquestion the Danish Government fully agrees with the views\r\nand conclusions against legalization expressed by the\r\nInternational Narcotics Control Board. In situations where\r\nborder controls are being reduced or abolished, the three\r\nUnited Nations Conventions which attempt to limit the use\r\nof drugs strictly to medical and scientific purposes are of\r\nspecial importance.\r\nThe Danish Government therefore wants to keep up the\r\npolice efforts against the men behind organized drug crime.\r\nBut at the same time we must consider a new approach to\r\nthe drug abusers. There may be a need to shift the focus of\r\nour efforts from law enforcement to prevention and\r\ntreatment. This change of priorities should be mirrored also\r\nin international cooperation.\r\nIn my view a change in our approach to drug abusers\r\nmay be carried out in a controlled way so as to benefit both\r\nthe drug abusers and society. In general, Danish prevention\r\nactivities rest on the premise that the most important\r\nmeasures are of a general nature: we must ensure that\r\nchildren and young people grow up with good conditions of\r\nlife and with free scope to develop their abilities.\r\nIn Denmark the information aspect is traditionally\r\nconsidered to be very important. The basic principles for\r\ninformation about drugs are to provide objective knowledge\r\nrather than to create fear and to increase awareness rather\r\nthan to moralize. It is important to initiate debate in the\r\nsocial groups where young people meet, as well as in society\r\nin general.\r\nA substantial part of prevention and education activities\r\nconcerning substance abuse is carried out at the local level.\r\nThe activities are run by public organizations, such as\r\nregional youth centres and schools, and by drug-abuse\r\ncounsellors. Coordination groups have been set up which\r\nconsist of representatives from the local schools, the social\r\nsector and the police. These efforts are supported at the\r\nnational level by coordination measures, professional advice\r\nand information material.\r\nIn Denmark the organization and implementation of\r\nsocial relief measures in relation to drug addicts are\r\ndecentralized. Responsibility lies with the counties and the\r\nmunicipal authorities. It is the task of the municipal\r\nauthorities to alleviate the general social problems of\r\nindividuals and families. The task of the counties is to\r\ncontribute in the case of individuals, such as drug addicts,\r\nrequiring special treatment.\r\nPublic services aimed at drug addicts are complemented\r\nby work undertaken by private or voluntary charity\r\norganizations. The Danish Government provides funding for\r\nthose organizations.\r\nTreatment measures focus on the actual addiction\r\nproblem as well as on the underlying reasons for addiction,\r\nand a variety of social remedies are made use of. Initiatives\r\ninvolve resocialization, rehabilitation and care. The overall\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 23\r\naim is to improve living conditions from both a social and\r\na health point of view.\r\nThe question of groups with severe social problems,\r\nincluding drug addicts, is given high priority by the Danish\r\nGovernment. The Minister for Social Affairs closely follows\r\nefforts in this field in order to ensure that adequate treatment\r\nand social-relief measures are available in counties and\r\nmunicipalities.\r\nFinally, I should like to confirm Danish support for\r\ncoordinated international action in the fight against illicit\r\ndrugs. In this respect the role of the United Nations, and\r\nespecially the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme, is crucial. Denmark expects that the\r\nProgramme will play a major role in future international\r\nefforts against drug abuse.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call upon Mr. James B.\r\nMoultrie, Permanent Representative of the Commonwealth\r\nof the Bahamas.\r\nMr. MOULTRIE (Bahamas): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the 12 States of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) that are States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nCARICOM States are deeply disturbed by the severity\r\nof the illicit drug problem, the devastating consequences of\r\nwhich are substantiated by the International Narcotics\r\nControl Board (INCB) and other competent bodies. The\r\nproblem continues unabated nearly a century after the\r\ninternational community began cooperative efforts for drug-\r\nabuse control at Shanghai in 1909. It persists\r\nnotwithstanding the rigorous and decisive action taken in\r\nrecent years to improve the institutions, rules and\r\nprogrammes of the international régime for controlling the\r\nillicit production and abuse of, and trafficking in, narcotic\r\ndrugs and psychotropic substances.\r\nThis is not to say that drug-abuse control efforts have\r\nnot yielded tangible, substantive and measurable results.\r\nThey have. Those results have, however, fallen far short of\r\nwhat is required for the control - and certainly for the\r\nelimination - of the illicit-drug problem. Consequently, the\r\nGeneral Assembly has challenged us to examine urgently the\r\nstatus of international cooperation in drug-abuse control and\r\nto strengthen and enhance that cooperation with a view to\r\npursuing and achieving key drug-control objectives at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels. The CARICOM\r\nStates are encouraged that this initiative focuses on the\r\ninternational drug-control system, which for nearly 50 years\r\nhas been centred in the United Nations. An examination of\r\nthe strengths and weaknesses of the system is essential to set\r\nin motion a process to increase its effectiveness.\r\nThe CARICOM States hold that the effectiveness of the\r\ndrug-abuse control system is dependent on the political will\r\nand commitment of States to take decisive action to make it\r\nwork. It is States that must ratify the international drug-\r\ncontrol treaties, which contribute significantly to the global\r\nfight against drug abuse and illicit trafficking. CARICOM\r\nStates realize, however, that the full impact of the treaties\r\nwill not be felt until all States ratify them and implement\r\ntheir provisions.\r\nThe Secretary-General reports that an increasing\r\nnumber of States are in fact ratifying the treaties.\r\nCARICOM States are among those that have ratified all the\r\ntreaties, and one CARICOM State, the Bahamas, was the\r\nvery first to ratify the 1988 Convention. We can therefore\r\njoin in launching an organized effort to encourage universal\r\nratification of the treaties and to give priority to the\r\nimplementation of or adherence to their provisions.\r\nCARICOM States are also among those that have\r\nadministrative measures for the control of both the illicit and\r\nlicit trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and\r\nthat are endeavouring to bring national legislation into line\r\nwith the provisions of the treaties.\r\nWhile we believe that preference should not be given\r\nto any one of the drug-control treaties, CARICOM States\r\nsupport efforts to implement the provisions of the 1988\r\nConvention that introduce new elements in the fight against\r\ndrug abuse and illicit trafficking. These include article 5, on\r\nconfiscation, article 7, on mutual legal assistance, and article\r\n12, concerning precursors and essential chemicals. There\r\nhas already been some experience within our subregion of\r\nmaterially cooperating with other States for the confiscation\r\nof the proceeds of drug trafficking. Those proceeds have\r\nbeen shared between the cooperating Governments. It is\r\nexperiences such as these that must serve as examples of\r\nenhancing international cooperation in drug-abuse control.\r\nArticle 10 of the 1988 Convention, on international\r\ncooperation and assistance to transit States, also suggests a\r\nnew strategy for counteracting the drug problem, a strategy\r\nthat is of particular importance to CARICOM States. We\r\nare all affected in varying degrees of severity by the illicit\r\ntransit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances\r\nfrom source and supply centres in South America to illicit\r\nmarkets in North America and Europe. Whether directly or\r\nindirectly, this illicit transit traffic has had an impact on the\r\npeople of all of our countries, subjecting or exposing them\r\nto the scourge of drug abuse. It has torn at the fibres of\r\nsociety in our small island developing States and has obliged\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nour Governments to divert scarce resources from\r\nsocio-economic development to wage costly battles against\r\nillicit trafficking networks and to put in place expensive\r\ntreatment and rehabilitation strategies.\r\nThrough our own efforts, subregional efforts and joint\r\nefforts with other countries, including the United States,\r\nCanada, the United Kingdom and France, we have achieved\r\nsome success in bringing this illicit transit traffic under\r\ncontrol, but it has been at a price that CARICOM\r\nGovernments can ill afford to continue to pay. We therefore\r\nurge major donors, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs\r\n(CND) and the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP) to give special attention to article 10\r\nin international efforts to implement the 1988 Convention.\r\nCARICOM States are directly in the maritime routes\r\nfrom South to North America. Virtually all smuggling\r\nnetworks into and through our subregion, including the\r\nfrequently used drug-drop method, involve some activity at\r\nsea. We therefore support and will participate to the extent\r\npossible in current CND and UNDCP efforts to implement\r\narticle 17 of the 1988 Convention on illicit traffic by sea.\r\nWe agree that initiatives in this area must take fully into\r\naccount international law and practice, particularly the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nPrimary responsibility for drug-abuse control rests with\r\nGovernments, which must accord it high priority. This is\r\nthe approach to which we agreed in the Global Programme\r\nof Action. CARICOM States believe that progress in\r\nachieving the objectives of the Global Programme of Action\r\ndepends on how we perceive it. We see the Programme as\r\nmuch more than a consensus product of the General\r\nAssembly. It is a landmark agreement, a blueprint setting\r\nout comprehensive courses of action for all aspects of drug-\r\nabuse control and an essential element in the global strategy\r\nfor drug-abuse control.\r\nThe master plan approach which the UNDCP promotes\r\nprovides a strategy for maximizing efforts to implement the\r\nProgramme. CARICOM States regard master plans not as\r\nproject documents, but as the articulation by Governments of\r\ntheir priorities and objectives in all areas of drug control and\r\nthe steps which they intend to take to implement them.\r\nMaster plans are nevertheless aids to international\r\ncooperation, providing a ready reference to the UNDCP, the\r\nUnited Nations system and the donor community of the\r\nareas developing country Governments have identified for\r\npriority action. CARICOM States can also support the\r\nimpetus to establish of national coordinating machinery for\r\ndrug-abuse control, since these make for more\r\ncomprehensive and coherent strategies at the national level.\r\nWe know that satisfactory progress has yet to be made\r\nin a number of important areas of the Programme. More\r\nmust be done in the demand-reduction area, particularly by\r\nmajor consuming countries. In this regard, we are heartened\r\nby the recent statement by President Clinton of the United\r\nStates.\r\nCARICOM States support balanced drug-control\r\nstrategies, which give appropriate priority to both primary\r\nprevention and treatment and rehabilitation. The\r\ndevelopment of drug-abuse assessment systems to monitor\r\nthe nature, extent and patterns of drug abuse, the\r\nintensification of education and public information\r\nprogrammes and the establishment of partnerships with\r\nnon-governmental organizations are all strategies we support.\r\nWe are also prepared to consider creative approaches to\r\ndemand reduction, including the creation of international\r\nobligations in this area.\r\nThere is an urgent need to think and act creatively to\r\nsupport strategies that stimulate socio-economic growth and\r\nreinforce alternative rural development in developing\r\ncountries where narcotic drugs are produced. CARICOM\r\nStates believe that the evident links between poverty and\r\ndeprivation and illicit drug production and trafficking in\r\ndeveloping countries must be fully explored. Priority must\r\nalso be given to restructuring international economic\r\nrelations to ensure that the international economic system\r\nresponds effectively to the efforts of developing countries to\r\nmove their people away from illicit narcotics production to\r\nalternative crops. The interest demonstrated by the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank in these\r\nareas is promising. Debt-for-drugs swaps are currently being\r\nconsidered. CARICOM States hope to see positive results\r\nin this area, results which take into account and include\r\nindebted transit States.\r\nThe UNDCP, created by the General Assembly to lead\r\nand coordinate international drug-abuse-control efforts within\r\nthe United Nations system and internationally, is to serve as\r\nthe crucible for forging new ideas and approaches. The\r\nUNDCP has shown great promise in its three short years of\r\noperation. We are anxious to see it attain its full potential.\r\nWe wish to emphasize here that while it is essential to give\r\na degree of flexibility to the UNDCP, it is, in the final\r\nanalysis, an instrument in the hands of Governments. It will\r\nmake a distinct and valuable contribution only if\r\nGovernments give it clear directives and the authority and\r\nprestige to carry them out. Diverse and equitable\r\nparticipation in the work of the UNDCP will provide the\r\ndepth of experience essential for formulating viable drug-\r\ncontrol strategies and policies to meet objectives in all\r\nregions of the world.\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 25\r\nRegional cooperation, which UNDCP advocates,\r\ncomplemented by international cooperation, provides an\r\nimportant line of defence against the drug menace. Channels\r\nof communication with non-governmental organizations will\r\nensure that UNDCP benefits from their hands-on, grass-roots\r\nexperience. For example, UNDCP stands to benefit in its\r\ndemand-reduction efforts from the World Conference on the\r\nRole of Non-Governmental Organizations in Demand\r\nReduction, scheduled to take place in 1994. The United\r\nNations Decade against Drug Abuse provides an important\r\ntime frame for intensified drug-control initiatives.\r\nCARICOM States believe, given these factors, that UNDCP\r\ncan and will meet our expectations.\r\nUNDCP must be assisted by the United Nations system\r\nin its effort to lead and coordinate an international response\r\ncommensurate with the global dimensions of the illicit-drug\r\ncrisis. We therefore support the System-Wide Action Plan\r\nDrug Abuse Control as an instrument for effective, system-\r\nwide cooperation. We urge the entities and agencies of the\r\nsystem to make determined efforts to formulate agency-\r\nspecific implementation plans which incorporate the Action\r\nPlan, and urge that Member States in oversight bodies keep\r\ntheir action for drug-abuse control fully under review. We\r\nalso support close cooperation between the UNDCP and the\r\nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on\r\ntransnational drug-related crime.\r\nThe Commission on Narcotic Drugs is the principal\r\npolicy-making body for drug-abuse control within the United\r\nNations system. It must determine the principles and\r\nprocedures for strengthening international cooperation,\r\naccelerating the pace of drug-control countermeasures and\r\nimproving its own functioning. This high-level session is set\r\nto pass on to the Commission a number of important tasks\r\nwhich will require penetrating analysis of leading\r\nsocio-economic, legal, political and security questions arising\r\nfrom the illicit-drug phenomenon. To carry out these tasks\r\neffectively, the Commission must function according to its\r\nmandate as a body of experts in the drug-related fields.\r\nCARICOM States believe it would be appropriate for the\r\nCommission to turn to a core group of experts from among\r\nits Member States to assist it in implementing the mandates\r\nof the high-level session, a task in which it should also be\r\nassisted by the Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement\r\nAgencies and the Subcommission.\r\nCARICOM States will also support the request to the\r\nEconomic and Social Council to give priority to the\r\nconsideration of drug-control issues. We intend to\r\nparticipate fully when the Council examines the coordination\r\naspects of drug-abuse control, as well as in its high-level\r\nreview of the drug problem.\r\nIt is impossible, in these times of shrinking resources,\r\nto consider international cooperation in drug-abuse control\r\nwithout examining the question of funding. We cannot\r\nexpect the UNDCP to implement its extensive mandate or to\r\nbe competent and influential without sufficient resources.\r\nBut there is another side to this resource question: the cost\r\nto developing countries, including those of CARICOM, of\r\nwaging a war against international drug traffickers, whose\r\nresources can exceed those of Governments themselves. The\r\nfinancial outlay constitutes a formidable obstacle to\r\ndevelopment. We therefore support the appeal that more\r\nresources should be allocated to the drug area and that States\r\nin a position to do so should increase contributions to the\r\nFund of the UNDCP to enable it to assist developing\r\ncountries better in their drug-control efforts.\r\nNo State can rely solely on its own efforts to control\r\nthe illicit production, trafficking and demand for narcotic\r\ndrugs and psychotropic substances. Each has an essential\r\nrole to play in enforcing global standards and norms to\r\ncontrol this transnational problem. The Declaration of the\r\nInternational Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit\r\nTrafficking said that drug-abuse control was the collective\r\nresponsibility of all States, a principle reiterated by the\r\nseventeenth special session of the General Assembly and in\r\nnumerous resolutions and decisions throughout the United\r\nNations system. Although boundaries should not constitute\r\ninsuperable obstacles to our collective efforts, CARICOM\r\nStates are unequivocal in their view that shared responsibility\r\nfor drug control must fully respect international law and\r\npractice, including the provisions of the United Nations\r\nCharter. This approach is essential if we are to prevent\r\ntensions from arising between countries which must be\r\npartners in the war against drugs.\r\nThis high-level session must be a catalyst for dynamic\r\nand effective cooperation in international drug control,\r\ngrounded in the progress we have made. Regional\r\norganizations and arrangements, including the\r\nInter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission and\r\nCARICOM are playing an essential role in making the drug-\r\ncontrol system truly global. The International Narcotics\r\nControl Board continues to maintain the high standards of its\r\ncritical work of monitoring implementation of the\r\ninternational drug-control treaties and ensuring that States do\r\nnot suffer from inertia in meeting their obligations under the\r\ninternational drug-control treaties. In its 1992 report, for\r\nexample, the Board effectively dispelled the notion that\r\nlegislation was an option for effective implementation of the\r\ndrug-control treaties, a position which CARICOM States\r\nfully support.\r\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nOur goals are attainable, but we must be willing to\r\nmake the fundamental policy adjustments necessary to\r\nconfront new and emerging manifestations of the illicit-drug\r\nproblem. A truly global response equal to the present-day\r\nchallenge of drug abuse and illicit trafficking demands\r\ntwenty-first-century solutions to this recurring twentieth-\r\ncentury scourge. There can be no erosion of the political\r\npriority for drug-abuse control. CARICOM States are fully\r\ncommitted to the strengthening of international cooperation\r\nin this critical area.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Mr. Louis Galea,\r\nMinister for Home Affairs and Social Development of Malta.\r\nMr. GALEA (Malta): We are gathered here today, this\r\ngreat family of nations, to consider once again at a global\r\nlevel the situation regarding drug abuse and illicit trafficking,\r\nto review the measures being adopted and the unstinting\r\nefforts required to deal with the problem effectively and to\r\nrenew our commitment to take all necessary action on this\r\nmatter, as a duty and service to mankind.\r\nIn its report for 1993 the International Narcotics\r\nControl Board describes the drug abuse and illicit trafficking\r\nsituation as grim. Undoubtedly, our primary duty is to\r\nfollow the Board’s exhortation to ensure our efforts are\r\ncontinuous and balanced, and are carried out in an\r\ninternationally concerted manner - and, may I add, in a\r\nnationally concerted manner - so that further positive results\r\nmay be achieved. We owe this to our children, our youth\r\nand future generations.\r\nIt is to be recalled that the Political Declaration adopted\r\nat the seventeenth special session of the General Assembly\r\nspecifically affirms that the fundamental responsibility to\r\ntake the necessary actions to combat the drug problem rests\r\nwith each State. Moreover, the Global Programme of Action\r\nappeals to States to take the necessary follow-up measures\r\nto promote and implement the Programme and to translate\r\nit into practical action to the widest possible extent. At the\r\nsame time, the struggle against drugs is recognized as a\r\nshared responsibility requiring action on a global scale\r\nthrough regional and international coordination and\r\ninitiatives.\r\nThe setting up of the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme (UNDCP) in 1990, with the exclusive\r\nresponsibility to coordinate all United Nations drug control\r\nactivities, promote the implementation of international\r\nconventions on the subject and provide effective leadership\r\nin international drug control, is a vivid example of putting\r\none’s beliefs into practice. The benefits of this measure are\r\nalready being reaped; UNDCP is working in close\r\ncoordination with United Nations specialized agencies, other\r\ninternational and non-governmental organizations and\r\nfinancial institutions, and is seeing to the execution of\r\nmultiple projects. My Government believes that UNDCP is\r\na dynamic institution, working with increased efficacy and\r\nstrength, and that it should be regarded as the spearhead of\r\ninternational drug control activities. I join preceding\r\nspeakers who had words of appreciation for the leadership\r\nand commitment that the Executive Director, Mr.\r\nGiacomelli, has brought to the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme.\r\nMalta, a small, developing nation at the crossroads of\r\nthe Mediterranean, an intercultural meeting place where\r\nNorth meets South and East meets West, has not been spared\r\nthe ravages of drugs. With its limited financial and human\r\nresources, it is trying to control the problem at the national\r\nlevel, and to contribute at a regional and international level\r\nin an integrated and comprehensive manner.\r\nIn August 1988 two structures were set up - an\r\nInter-Ministerial Committee to ensure the implementation of\r\nappropriate measures and a National Commission including\r\nexperts from the governmental and non-governmental sectors -\r\nwith the specific mandates of formulating recommendations,\r\nmaintaining international contacts and coordinating and\r\ndeveloping all necessary services. The master-plan approach\r\nwas adopted, with an analysis of the existing drug problems\r\nin the country, an assessment of existing drug control efforts\r\nand the identification of those activities needed for more\r\neffective control. Much has been achieved. But much more\r\nstill needs to be done.\r\nMr. Marker (Pakistan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nWhile there is a demand for drugs, there will always be\r\na supply. Demand reduction is therefore one of the\r\npriorities, in order to eliminate the illicit demand for narcotic\r\ndrugs and psychotropic substances. Prevention and\r\neducation, in whatever form, play a major role in this. Life\r\nskills and personal and social education programmes have\r\nbeen introduced in school curricula. Specific training\r\ncourses have been offered to life skills teachers and guidance\r\nand counselling teachers, with the assistance of foreign\r\nexperts. Other teachers have been awarded scholarships for\r\nthe purpose of receiving the appropriate training abroad.\r\nThe Chemical Abuse Awareness Unit within the Education\r\nDepartment and the Health Education Unit within the Health\r\nDepartment undertake programmes aimed at achieving\r\nproper behavioral roles. National anti-drug campaigns\r\nthrough the mass media are conducted by the National\r\nCommission which also publishes drug awareness and\r\ninformation literature directed at various strata of society.\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 27\r\nOur Commission is also developing a public information and\r\nresource centre on drug, alcohol and tobacco abuse, while\r\nthe Ministry for Youth and the Arts has set up an ongoing\r\n\"Youth Against Drugs\" campaign.\r\nOn the treatment side, we have two detoxification units,\r\none in Malta and one on the sister island of Gozo.\r\nRound-the-clock services are available at the units and in\r\ncommunity clinics. Drug abusers thus have access to the\r\ntreatment they may require. A residential drug dependence\r\nunit for long-term detoxification has been established, with\r\na separate hostel for female drug abusers who are\r\nundergoing the detoxification programme within the unit.\r\nDrug abusers seeking treatment are tested for hepatitis and\r\nHIV. Social workers and medical staff have received\r\ntraining abroad, and in-service training courses are provided\r\nfor those working with drug abusers. A Working Committee\r\nset up at the beginning of this year to evaluate the treatment\r\nservices in the fields of drug and alcohol abuse has\r\ncompleted its work, and its recommendations are being\r\nactively considered for implementation according to priority.\r\nThe Government firmly believes that non-governmental\r\norganizations can play a pivotal role in demand reduction\r\nactivities and non-medical treatment or rehabilitation of drug\r\nabusers. Caritas (Malta) has for many years been at the\r\nforefront, carrying out its prevention work through seminars,\r\nlectures and training courses for parents, teachers and the\r\ncommunity at large, and through its various publications. It\r\nalso runs its own structures which provide non-medical\r\nrehabilitation programmes for drug abusers. More recently,\r\nthe Independent Organization for Assistance and Solidarity\r\n(OASI), a non-governmental foundation, was set up to\r\nundertake prevention activities within the community of\r\nGozo and to undertake rehabilitation programmes for drug\r\nabusers and alcoholics. The Government concretely supports\r\nsuch organizations.\r\nThe issue of law enforcement is a crucial aspect that\r\nalso has to be given priority. Malta is not a producing\r\ncountry, but its strategic position, with a relatively long\r\nshoreline, with its yachting facilities, increasing air traffic,\r\never-expanding tourist industry and transshipment facilities\r\ncan make it an ideal location for transit traffic. But Malta\r\nrefuses to be a transit zone. Coordinated action between its\r\nlaw enforcement forces has already achieved modest\r\nsuccesses. Specialized courses have been run by foreign\r\nexperts for armed forces, customs and police personnel. The\r\nsetting up of a Customs Anti-Drug Squad was followed by\r\nthe formation of a sniffer dog section within the Squad.\r\nIn-service courses on drug awareness, search and\r\nidentification are being run by the Customs Department for\r\nall customs personnel. Police recruits at the Police Academy\r\nare being trained in, inter alia, search and investigation\r\ntechniques, drug identification and legislation. All three\r\nforces have acquired or are in the process of acquiring\r\nequipment to enhance their effectiveness and functionality.\r\nThe creation of the National Drugs Intelligence Unit,\r\npresently in its infancy, for the purpose of intelligence\r\ngathering and dissemination, is intended to enhance the\r\ncontrol of illicit traffic through cooperation and coordination\r\nbetween all three forces and with other national and\r\ninternational or regional units.\r\nRecognition must be given to UNDCP for a technical\r\nand financial agreement which has made possible the\r\nimplementation of a number of the measures I have outlined.\r\nMalta is committed to international cooperation. It is\r\na member of INTERPOL, the Customs Cooperation Council\r\nand the Pompidou Group. It participates in the sessions of\r\nthe Commission on Narcotic Drugs as well as in several\r\ninternational conferences and meetings. It has entered into\r\nbilateral agreements with other States with a view to\r\nconsolidating reciprocal efforts in controlling drug abuse and\r\ntrafficking. It will also be participating in the so-called\r\nTeledrug Operation, and the relevant treaty with the\r\nGovernment of Italy has been signed in this respect.\r\nMalta is a party to the Single Convention on Narcotic\r\nDrugs of 1961, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, and to the\r\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. Although\r\nnot yet a party to the Convention against Illicit Traffic in\r\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988, it is\r\nour declared intention to become a party to it as soon as the\r\nappropriate legislation is in place, and we are already\r\nabiding by the reporting requirements under this Convention.\r\nAt present a bill to amend our Dangerous Drugs Ordinance\r\nis before our Parliament, seeking to introduce in its provision\r\non, inter alia, money-laundering offenses, pre-trial financial\r\ninvestigations and controlled delivery. We intend to present\r\nother proposed legislation for consideration.\r\nUnscrupulously, drug traffickers take advantage of areas\r\nwith political, social and economic problems. The\r\ncorruption and violence associated with drug trafficking can\r\ndestabilize a whole country or a whole region. It can be a\r\nthreat to the security of any nation and of any region. For\r\ninstance, events in Central and Eastern Europe and the\r\nflexibility with which drug traffickers can alter their routes\r\nshould make us look upon drug trafficking as being a threat\r\nto the security of the Mediterranean region in the same way\r\nas it is a threat to other areas of the globe. This means that\r\njoint efforts should continue to be undertaken to strengthen\r\nthe operational efficacy of national and international law\r\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nenforcement bodies through provision of the requisite\r\nfinancial and technical resources.\r\nMalta renews its pledge to support fully the concerted\r\nefforts being made by the United Nations to control the\r\nworld drug problem. We commit ourselves to the Political\r\nDeclaration adopted by this Assembly at its seventeenth\r\nspecial session. We endorse the recommendations presented\r\nbefore us today and associate ourselves with the principles\r\nenunciated in the Tehran Declaration as we too firmly\r\nbelieve in the\r\n\"importance of human dignity and of human aspirations\r\nto a decent life based on moral, humanitarian and\r\nspiritual values in a healthy and safe environment\".\r\n(E/CN.7/1993/2, p. 9)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Mr. Alecos\r\nShambos, the Permanent Representative of Cyprus.\r\nMr. SHAMBOS (Cyprus): Over the past two decades,\r\nthe spread of illicit drugs has assumed unprecedented\r\nproportions. It has already reached every part of the globe.\r\nNo nation has remained immune to the devastating effects of\r\ndrug abuse. The magnitude of the problem was duly\r\nhighlighted by the General Assembly at the special session\r\nin 1990. The relevant United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme has done much to enhance the overall\r\nstructure and framework for drug-abuse control. The\r\nnarcotic plague is, however, still with us, without any sign\r\nof subsiding.\r\nWe have gathered here today, specialists and policy\r\nmakers together, to think of new ways of facing more\r\nresolutely the catastrophic manifestations of the evil of drugs\r\nin human society. Thus far, in the light of the universal\r\ncommitment to eliminate the curse of drug abuse, the\r\ndetermined approach of the United Nations to control drug\r\nproduction and trafficking has drawn considerable support\r\nand cooperation all over the world. The declared war on\r\ndrugs is indeed one of the ultimate priorities of the world\r\ncommunity, and that war cannot be won without concerted\r\ninternational cooperation and action. To further this end, the\r\npresent deliberations of the Assembly will hopefully add new\r\ndetermined efforts generating a greater impetus in the fight\r\nagainst drug abuse and new resoluteness in facing the\r\nchallenges lying ahead.\r\nCyprus remains fully committed to the cause of\r\ncombating the scourge of drugs through coordinated regional\r\nand international mechanisms which could yield effective\r\naction and results - the more so since my country is\r\ngeographically situated in a region considered to be one of\r\nthe major crossroads of heavy drug trafficking. I should\r\nemphasize, though, that, despite some indications that\r\nCyprus is being used as a transit point for smuggling\r\ntowards Western Europe, the United States, Canada and\r\nAustralia, the country itself does not have a serious problem\r\nof local drug consumption or drug abuse, and there is not a\r\nconsiderable subculture of drug addicts, as there is in some\r\nother countries. This is illustrated by the fact that cases of\r\nhard drug use are rare, and that there has never been a drug-\r\nrelated death. The authorities, however, always on the alert,\r\nare concerned that the danger is now more apparent than\r\never before, and that widespread use of drugs may grow in\r\nthe future. As a matter of fact, recent statistics show a\r\nsteady increase in the use of hashish and marijuana in\r\nCyprus. Almost all drugs consumed in my country are\r\nsmuggled either from neighbouring countries or through the\r\noccupied part of Cyprus.\r\nBelieving, as we do, that the problem can be effectively\r\ntackled only by drastic action and decisive international\r\ncooperation, we participate in various United Nations bodies\r\ncombating the spread of narcotic drugs. Moreover, we\r\ncooperate effectively with European organizations, such as\r\nthe Council of Europe, especially the Pompidou Group.\r\nThis participation is strengthened by our ratification of the\r\ninternational Conventions against drugs of 1961, 1971 and\r\n1988, and by bilateral agreements on drug control that we\r\nhave concluded with interested countries. Cyprus has also\r\nacceded to the Council of Europe Convention on\r\nLaundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the\r\nProceeds from Crime.\r\nOn a national level, legislation has recently been\r\npromulgated, providing heavier penalties such as life\r\nimprisonment and confiscation of proceeds from the\r\ntrafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.\r\nCyprus serves as host to full-time drug liaison officers and\r\ncooperates with INTERPOL and other agencies on\r\ninternational drug-trafficking cases. It is worth mentioning\r\nthat 14 liaison officers from various countries are posted in\r\nCyprus on a permanent basis. Through coordinated action,\r\nwe have steadily been successful in effecting significant\r\narrests and seizures both in Cyprus and in other countries.\r\nA serious impediment, however, to the combating of\r\ncrime by the police and enforcement agencies of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus is the fact that 37 per cent of our\r\nterritory has been under occupation since 1974. This\r\nunacceptable situation creates ideal conditions for drug\r\ntrafficking, as the illegally used ports and airports in the\r\noccupied areas are not under the supervision and control of\r\nthe Government.\r\n37th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 29\r\nRecently, the specially trained narcotics squads of our\r\npolice force have been reinforced and their technical\r\nequipment has been modernized. This, however, is not\r\nadequate, as advances in knowledge and technology cause\r\nrapid change. Consequently, the need arises for a constant\r\nexchange of information and intelligence, and we attach\r\ngreat importance to this exchange, as it enhances the drug-\r\nfighting process and enables Governments to achieve greater\r\nsuccess in suppressing drug abuse.\r\nPrevention, treatment and rehabilitation constitute a\r\nvery significant component of our strategy in the fight\r\nagainst drugs. In this connection, although we are not yet\r\nexperiencing a serious drug-abuse problem within our\r\ncountry, the prospect of this dire and fatal danger to our\r\npeople - especially the youth - is foremost in our minds.\r\nThis is why our newly reviewed national policy against drug\r\nabuse has a note of urgency and resolve. It involves\r\ncoordination of the efforts of Government agencies and the\r\nprivate sector through a national committee for the\r\nprevention of drug abuse and trafficking. In the first stage,\r\nour efforts concentrated on the precise extent of and trends\r\nin the drug-abuse problem and the categories and\r\ncharacteristics of drug abusers and sources of supply. The\r\nexperts supplemented these efforts with studies on the\r\nprevailing attitudes of various groups within the population\r\nvis-à-vis narcotic drugs.\r\nMeanwhile, the Government is following a policy of\r\nintroducing preventive programmes based on education and\r\nthe dissemination of information. The main purpose of this\r\npolicy is the training of such persons as teachers, parents and\r\nadministrators on a nation-wide basis to sever as the focal\r\npoints in increasing awareness on all levels and, above all,\r\nthe utilization of the strong structure of the Cypriot family\r\nagainst the use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic\r\nsubstances.\r\nThe National Information Committee is the body\r\nresponsible for offering advice and drug counselling. A\r\nspecial programme is now under review to reinforce the\r\nexisting related services. Similarly, in the field of treating\r\ndrug abusers, our target is to establish a special\r\ndetoxification centre. Rehabilitation is the other leg of our\r\npolicy. In our effort to reintegrate drug abusers into society\r\nand to provide a social infrastructure, we offer professional\r\ntraining to former drug addicts and encourage acceptance of\r\nthem by the public.\r\nFinally, I stress that resources are a very important\r\nelement in our fight against drugs. Cyprus, like other small\r\ncountries, has inadequate resources to combat effectively the\r\ntrafficking in and distribution of drugs. We hope that,\r\nthrough an internationally regulated assistance project aimed\r\nat securing improved education, training and equipment, the\r\nfight against drugs will eventually emerge as a considerably\r\nmore effective fight throughout the globe, for the benefit of\r\nthe present and future generations of mankind.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
