"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n38th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nTuesday, 26 October 1993\r\nat 3 p.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 112 (continued)\r\nINTERNATIONAL DRUG CONTROL\r\nHIGH-LEVEL PLENARY MEETINGS TO\r\nEXAMINE THE STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL\r\nCOOPERATION AGAINST THE ILLICIT\r\nPRODUCTION, SALE, DEMAND, TRAFFIC AND\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF NARCOTICS AND\r\nPSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES: DRAFT\r\nRESOLUTION (A/48/L.12)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The first speaker this afternoon is\r\nthe representative of the Czech Republic, on whom I now\r\ncall.\r\nMr. SLABÝ (Czech Republic): We are meeting at a\r\nunique moment in the complex history of the world, at a\r\ntime when many decades-old East-West barriers have\r\ncollapsed. At the same time, the world today is threatened\r\nby a global challenge to the stability of the international\r\ncommunity as well as to the democratic institutions of\r\nindividual countries. The illegal drugs trade is delivering\r\nnarcotics to approximately 100 million drug-addicted\r\npersons. From 1970 to 1985, Western European countries\r\nexperienced a real narcotics boom, with all the attendant\r\nhealth and social consequences. The drug problem has\r\ngrown into an epidemic of a kind never experienced by\r\nEurope before.\r\nIn the former communist and today’s post-communist\r\nStates of Central and Eastern Europe, developments have\r\nbeen less dramatic. Still, the problem existed, and it grew\r\nsignificantly during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. But thanks\r\nto the strong system of social control, the limited\r\npossibilities for foreign travel and the lack of freely-\r\ndisposable foreign currencies, neither demand nor supply\r\nreached the magnitude experienced in Western democracies.\r\nCommunist regimes used to be consistent in making the\r\nproblem of drugs a taboo; in the countries of Central and\r\nEastern Europe there was therefore little social awareness of\r\nthe drug problem as such or of ways to cope with it.\r\nDevelopments on the drug scene since 1990 in the\r\nformer Czechoslovakia and subsequently in the Czech\r\nRepublic have completely changed my country’s internal\r\nsituation in this respect. The opening up of borders, the\r\nliberalization of society, changes in values, and the transition\r\nof the country’s economy have all resulted in a sharp\r\nincrease in both the supply of and demand for drugs, in the\r\ncreation of a market for classic hard drugs, and indeed in the\r\nemergence of international organized crime. In 1991 there\r\nwere 6,590 registered addicts in the Czech Republic; yet the\r\nso-called grey zone, the number of addicted but not\r\nregistered persons, is estimated to have been 10 times that\r\nfigure. Lower age groups, including schoolchildren, are now\r\nbeing threatened. The situation in my country has been\r\ndescribed as \"a heroin epidemic at the gate\".\r\nThis new situation has led us to identify the abuse and\r\nillegal use of drugs as a grave domestic social problem, and\r\nhas challenged appropriate governmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations to deal with it.\r\nAt the end of 1991 the Government created an anti-\r\ndrug agency with decentralized regional offices, and in 1992\r\na national drug-information service. The Government\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86976 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.38\r\n16 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nemphasizes that the drug menace cannot be solved by\r\nisolated efforts, but only by the use of systematic and\r\ncombined measures in the fields of criminal prevention,\r\nemployment policy, education, health and social care,\r\nprotection of public health and other spheres. Shortly after\r\nthe division of Czechoslovakia, on 1 January 1993, the\r\nGovernment of the Czech Republic established an\r\ninterministerial anti-drug commission headed by the Minister\r\nof the Interior.\r\nHowever, international cooperation in the field of drugs\r\nis essential for us as well. It constitutes an inseparable part\r\nof the integration of the Czech Republic into European\r\nstructures and into the world community. In this respect let\r\nme stress how highly we appreciate the level of cooperation\r\nwith the specialized bodies of the United Nations, with the\r\nPompidou Group of the Council of Europe, the European\r\nCommunities, the World Health Organization (WHO) and\r\nother international bodies, and the assistance they are\r\nproviding to the Czech Republic. One example is the\r\nagreement recently concluded between the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and the\r\nCzech Republic relating to a programme of assistance in the\r\ncontext of the \"Balkan route\". The programme aims to\r\nstrengthen operational enforcement results in reducing the\r\nflow of illicit narcotics passing into and through the territory\r\nof the Czech Republic.\r\nThe decision to hold four high-level plenary meetings\r\nat the present session to urgently examine the status of\r\ninternational cooperation against the illicit production, sale,\r\ndemand and distribution of narcotic and psychotropic\r\nsubstances reflects the growing recognition by the\r\ninternational community that our common objectives will be\r\nachieved only through the pooling of our efforts. As many\r\nspeakers have already noted, the United Nations is adapting\r\nto an environment in which it has to handle many new and\r\ncomplex problems facing the international community,\r\nincluding drug abuse. The contours of a more efficient\r\nstruggle against drug abuse are taking more specific forms.\r\nMore and more States have acceded to international\r\nnarcotics-control treaties.\r\nThe establishment of the UNDCP, an integrated and\r\nspecialized United Nations body to combat narcotic drugs,\r\nwas the result of the international community’s recognition\r\nof the need for global efforts. We appreciate the UNDCP’s\r\ncrucial role in international drug-control activities. We have\r\nnoted with satisfaction encouraging signs of progress in\r\ncooperation between the UNDCP on the one hand and other\r\ninternational organizations, in particular international\r\ndevelopment and financial institutions, on the other. We\r\nalso regard the Global Programme of Action as extremely\r\nbeneficial for national anti-drug programmes, since it has\r\nprovided comprehensive guidelines for combating drug abuse\r\nand for coordinating anti-drug policies.\r\nThe Czech Parliament is in the process of formulating\r\nan overall anti-drug policy on the basis of a proposal by the\r\nGovernment. In accordance with the Global Programme of\r\nAction and the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of\r\nFuture Activities in Drug Abuse Control, we are preparing\r\nan action-oriented anti-drug plan under which we envisage\r\ntaking all possible measures to implement the\r\nrecommendations of those two documents. My\r\nGovernment’s basic aim is to create a social, political and\r\neconomic climate that would minimize the destructive\r\ninfluence of drugs. It would include protecting the citizen\r\nagainst drugs and support his individual decision to live a\r\ndrug-free life, while fully respecting his civil rights. Not\r\neven so-called soft drugs will be legalized in my country.\r\nTo this end the Government has already taken all\r\nnecessary measures to decrease the drug supply. The Czech\r\nRepublic has begun preventive actions at the national level\r\nand is involved in training health personnel. The\r\nGovernment has also declared its commitment to establish a\r\nsound legal and social system. Relevant legislation\r\ncontinues to be amended and other legislative changes are\r\nbeing prepared in order fully to implement international drug\r\ncontrol conventions. Steps have been taken to monitor and\r\nstop the illegal production of psychotropic substances. Many\r\naspects of this national anti-drug programme are still under\r\ndiscussion, including the replacement of the above-\r\nmentioned interministerial commission by a new\r\ngovernmental agency.\r\nMy country has concluded bilateral agreements with\r\nseveral countries on combating drug-related crime, in\r\nparticular drug trafficking, and has participated in European\r\nmeetings of the Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement\r\nAgencies (HONLEA). The effort to keep the country safe\r\nfrom drugs requires adequate resources. We therefore highly\r\nappreciate the invaluable international assistance that has\r\nbeen made available in providing expertise and equipment\r\nboth bilaterally and multilaterally.\r\nIn conclusion, let me assure the Assembly that the\r\nCzech Republic shares the belief that to succeed in the war\r\nagainst drugs the international community has to continue its\r\nconcerted efforts to combat all aspects of the drug menace.\r\nThe Czech Republic will be a part of it.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I am now pleased to call on\r\nMr. Michael Ausserwinkler, Minister for Health of Austria.\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 3\r\nMr. AUSSERWINKLER (Austria): The preamble to\r\nthe United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of\r\n1961 and the preamble to the United Nations Convention on\r\nPsychotropic Substances of 1971 both refer to the\r\nambivalent properties of narcotics and psychotropic\r\nsubstances. Administered in accordance with the state of\r\nmedical art they are indispensable, but if they are abused\r\nthey can lead to enormous human suffering, loss of social\r\nstatus and disastrous economic consequences. As a\r\nphysician and a government Minister of Health I am\r\nconfronted daily with this ambivalent situation of licit and\r\nillicit use and - like all representatives - I am well aware of\r\nthe urgent need for balanced global action in coordination\r\nwith the United Nations. I therefore consider it extremely\r\nimportant for us in this framework of high-level plenary\r\nmeetings to define our position on the world-wide drug\r\nproblem, decide on our further approach and agree on further\r\nmeasures to be taken. The adoption of the draft resolution\r\nbefore us reflects a broad consensus on the next steps to be\r\ntaken.\r\nHow to make use of the positive properties of some\r\ndrugs - the fact that often they help to stop intolerable pain\r\nand, if applied lege artis, at the right time and in the right\r\ndosage, lead to negligible addiction problems - is a subject\r\nto which the World Health Organization (WHO) has been\r\ndevoting itself for some time with a great sense of\r\nresponsibility. In accordance with the recommendations of\r\nWHO, we in Austria are planning to invest a great deal in\r\nthis area and we hope that the appeals from WHO will be\r\nlistened to throughout the world.\r\nThe other, negative side of the coin has been familiar\r\nto all of us for many years from the numerous examples of\r\nand experiences with drug addicts, dealers, criminals and\r\nlaunderers of drug money. As the International Narcotics\r\nControl Board points out in its 1992 annual report, the\r\nnumerous efforts made at the national and the international\r\nlevel have, unfortunately, not succeeded so far in checking\r\nthe world-wide abuse of, and illegal trafficking in drugs,\r\nwith their associated violence and corruption. This is still\r\ntrue despite three United Nations Conventions on drugs - the\r\nSingle Convention of 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic\r\nSubstances of 1971 and the United Nations Convention\r\nagainst Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\r\nSubstances of 1988.\r\nWhat I consider to be essential is that drug problems\r\ncan often be solved at their roots, that is to say, long before\r\nthey come to light, by educational, family, employment,\r\nhousing and social politics.\r\nThese facts are familiar to all of us and have been\r\nincorporated into the Declaration of the International\r\nConference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, held in\r\nVienna in 1987, and into the Comprehensive\r\nMultidisciplinary Outline of Future Activities in Drug Abuse\r\nControl. The call to ensure living conditions which prevent\r\nthe abuse of drugs is also part of the Global Programme of\r\nAction of 1990 and the final declaration of the World\r\nMinisterial Summit held in London in the same year.\r\nThe question then arises: What are we doing to put\r\nthese ideas into practice? With reference to the objectives\r\nof prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, I should like to\r\nreport briefly on the current situation in Austria.\r\nSince 1980 Austria has had a statutory system for\r\ncollecting data on drug abusers. As those data clearly show,\r\nthe situation in the area of illegal drugs was stationary in the\r\n1980s and moderate in comparison with other European\r\ncountries. It is only since 1991 that we have seen a marked\r\nrise, especially in the use of heroin by young people.\r\nThe recent alarming increase in heroin consumption by\r\nteenagers has prompted the Ministry of Health and the\r\nMinistry of Education to issue a teaching programme on\r\ndrug prevention for all schools. The programme requires\r\nthat attention be paid to these problems in the teaching of all\r\nschool subjects and it focuses on the discussion of habits and\r\nlifestyles which promote or reduce the individual’s well-\r\nbeing. These materials do not concentrate primarily on\r\ndrugs as such but concentrate on the question of a person’s\r\nneeds and how one can cope with difficult situations without\r\ntaking drugs.\r\nCurrently, the Ministry of Education, with support from\r\nmy Ministry, is working on a curriculum for basic and\r\nadvanced training for teachers in drug prevention. In\r\naddition to specific technical expertise in drug problems,\r\nteachers are to be given advice on how to exert pedagogic\r\ninfluence. The Ministry of Education has also commissioned\r\na research project to assess the efficiency, in terms of drug\r\nprevention, of various methods of organizing classroom\r\nwork.\r\nThe confusion created among young people who are led\r\nto believe that illegal drugs cannot be so dangerous if public\r\nopinion considers making them more easily accessible, is\r\nvery dangerous.\r\nWhile there are different views as to what themes drug\r\nprevention in education should stress, there is very broad\r\nconsensus that drug addicts are sick persons who are\r\nprimarily in need of treatment. Since 1980 the Austrian\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nDrugs Act has given every addict the choice of undergoing\r\ntreatment instead of a criminal sentence, provided, of course,\r\nthat he has not committed a serious crime. Under this law,\r\na number of in-patient and out-patient centres were created\r\nin the early 1980s, which provide assistance to more than\r\n5,000 persons every year and in addition give advice to a\r\nstill far larger number - family members, students, teachers,\r\nand so on. Treatment and advice are free as the centres are\r\nfunded entirely or in part by public authorities.\r\nWith the increasing menace of AIDS and in view of the\r\nfact that not all opiate addicts are able to go through with\r\nabstinence-oriented treatment, even with the best intentions,\r\nAustria made arrangements, in the late 1980s, for heroin\r\naddicts to undergo substitution treatment. So far, about\r\n2,500 patients have been treated under this programme. In\r\nthis context I should like to mention the manuals concerning\r\nthe detection and assay of heroin, cocaine, amphetamines\r\nand other drugs in biological specimens recently issued by\r\nthe Laboratory of the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme (UNDCP) in Vienna, and I am pleased\r\nto see that Austria’s support of this exercise has led to some\r\nbenefits for developed countries although it was originally\r\nintended primarily for developing countries.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to stress that we\r\nare very pleased to be the host country for UNDCP, with its\r\nvarious technical branches and units, with which many\r\ncountries have developed a wide range of fruitful and\r\npractical cooperation. Bearing in mind the importance that\r\nAustria attaches to the activities of the Programme, we have\r\nbeen increasing substantially our financial contribution to its\r\nwork. In this context, I should like also to express our\r\nappreciation to the UNDCP’s Director-General,\r\nMr. Giacomelli, and his staff for their work in implementing\r\nthe Programme.\r\nReturning to the substitution programme, I should like\r\nto stress that we have had favourable experience with regard\r\nto HIV prevention - there are hardly any new cases of\r\ninfection in this group - and the improved general medical\r\nand social status of the patients involved. One problem\r\nremains unsolved, however. I refer to the fact that many\r\nHIV-infected persons have little chance of social\r\nreintegration, and, given their AIDS problems, they tend to\r\nfail to develop their own future perspectives.\r\nRehabilitation must include occupational reintegration.\r\nFor many institutions that assist drug addicts, it has become\r\nstandard procedure to take appropriate action in this respect -\r\nby organizing training or retraining and by helping patients\r\nto find jobs. The employment service supports these\r\nactivities by providing financial aid to individuals and by\r\nfunding projects for a certain time. However, with the\r\ndeterioration in the labour-market situation and the rise in\r\nunemployment, it is becoming more and more difficult to\r\nfind work for cured drug addicts. Such people who cannot\r\nfind work receive monthly social-assistance payments, which\r\nhelp to meet their basic needs and include health insurance.\r\nThe drug problem is a multidisciplinary question. It\r\nrelates not only to public security, the fight against crime\r\nand crime prevention, but also to issues of health, social,\r\nyouth and family policy. The Austrian Federal Government\r\nis therefore promoting a coordinated approach to the causes\r\nof and the background to drug abuse and drug addiction.\r\nSocial policies, such as those relating to the fight\r\nagainst youth unemployment; family policies, particularly\r\nfinancial support for families with children; and education\r\npolicies, such as the policy of free access to pre-university\r\nsecondary schools and to higher education - these are\r\nregarded as being just as essential to drug prevention as are\r\nmeasures aimed at direct control of drugs and psychotropic\r\nsubstances.\r\nToday, there is broad agreement that the drug problem\r\nis not one just of supply, in the same way as it is not one\r\njust of demand. The drug problem reflects also the unsolved\r\nsocial conflicts and contradictions that exist in Austria, as\r\neverywhere else in the world.\r\nAlthough I, as a doctor, naturally consider the\r\npreventive approach and the treatment and reintegration of\r\ndrug patients as a priority concern in drug policy, I am\r\nconvinced that we cannot do without repressive action in\r\nsome areas. But I also know how difficult it is to fight\r\norganized drug crime and to take on powerful gangs, bearing\r\nin mind all the resources at their disposal.\r\nOf course, I also realize that a balanced drug policy can\r\nbe successful only if is supported on a global scale. Austria\r\nis not shirking its duty. We intend, in the very near future,\r\nto issue appropriate regulations on Annexes III and IV,\r\nwhich, so far, have not been implemented as required by the\r\n1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances and, thereby,\r\nto pave the way for our formal accession to this Convention.\r\nAnother essential step that is envisaged is the full\r\nimplementation of Article 12 of the United Nations\r\nConvention of 1988.\r\nBut international acts of solidarity are also needed\r\nurgently in respect of those activities that I have already said\r\nattack the deep roots of the drug problem. I refer to\r\nmeasures in the sphere of education, family, employment,\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 5\r\nhousing and social policy. Hence, all organizations of the\r\nUnited Nations family have a role to play in this field, to\r\npromote the well-being of the inhabitants of planet Earth.\r\nThat is why these organizations need our special support.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call Mr. Mauri Pekkarinen,\r\nMinister for Internal Affairs of Finland.\r\nMr. PEKKARINEN (Finland): The illicit production,\r\ntrafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs constitute an\r\nincreasingly difficult problem throughout the world. The\r\nwell-being and safety of large population groups, as well as\r\nthe implementation of their economic, social and other\r\nhuman rights, are threatened by the drug problem worldwide.\r\nThe drug issue has such global dimensions that there is\r\na clear need to intensify international co-operation. This\r\nought to be done by involving all relevant authorities and\r\ninternational organizations representing the education, social-\r\nwelfare, public-health, environment and law-enforcement\r\nsectors. The United Nations plays an important role in this\r\nwork. The United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP) has made commendable efforts to\r\ncoordinate the international struggle against drugs.\r\nEfforts have been made, through international\r\nagreements, to strengthen measures to prevent the\r\nproduction, sale, trafficking and distribution of narcotic\r\ndrugs. It is important that all States ratify all the United\r\nNations drug Conventions without delay.\r\nThere is wide agreement in the international community\r\nthat the drug problem cannot be prevented merely by efforts\r\nto restrict the supply of drugs. Accordingly, in recent years,\r\nthe question of demand reduction has been given increasing\r\nattention. We welcome the activities of the UNDCP in this\r\nmatter. We would give favourable consideration to the\r\ninclusion in international narcotics policies and legally\r\nbinding agreements of any measure aimed at reducing drug\r\ndemand.\r\nCombating drugs requires a comprehensive prevention\r\nstrategy, at both the international and the national levels.\r\nThe Global Programme of Action and the United Nations\r\nSystem-Wide Action Plan on Drug Abuse Control provide\r\na comprehensive framework for drug-control activities.\r\nThese programmes ought to be implemented in a systematic\r\nway. Information and education concerning the dangers of\r\ndrugs - whether to health or to social aspects of life -\r\ntogether with appropriate control systems, are essential\r\nelements of the fight against drugs. Preventive action can be\r\nsuccessful only if it is a part of an integrated programme\r\nthat takes account of all aspects of the problem and its\r\nunderlying causes.\r\nThe fight against drugs will be effective only if we are\r\nable to resolve the structural, social and economic factors\r\nthat result in the continued supply of and demand for drugs.\r\nDrug problems are linked to various criminal activities. The\r\ngrowth of drug-related violent crime is alarming. The\r\norganized drug brokers are running a large-scale business.\r\nProfits obtained through illegal deals are laundered by being\r\ninvested in legal business activities.\r\nIn order to keep organized drug-related crime in check,\r\nstrict control and legislative measures are necessary. In\r\naddition, means are needed to tackle the structures of the\r\nnarcotics trade in order to deprive this criminal business of\r\nits very foundation.\r\nThe problems related to drugs are global, cross-sectoral\r\nand ever-changing. As far as Europe is concerned, new\r\nproblems seem to be arising with the changing scene. We\r\nmust support the newly independent Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries in their fight against drugs. We must\r\nprevent, in time, the narcotics problem from expanding.\r\nSimultaneously, we have to build a system to prevent the\r\nnew flow of drugs from east to west and from west to east.\r\nTo accomplish this we need cooperation across boundaries\r\nat the regional and international levels. This is, of course,\r\ntrue with regard to other regions as well.\r\nIt is important that issues related to narcotic drugs be\r\ndiscussed at the highest international level with the aim of\r\npromoting peaceful, non-discriminatory and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. In view of the global nature of the drug\r\nproblem and the many issues relating to it, cooperation and\r\ngood coordination are extremely important. In this respect,\r\nI would welcome an examination by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council next year of the status of international\r\ncooperation within the United Nations system.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nnow call on His Excellency Mr. Jorge Carpizo, Attorney\r\nGeneral of the Republic of Mexico.\r\nMr. CARPIZO (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe come to this forum of the international community in the\r\nhope that our deliberations concerning the drug phenomenon\r\nwill contribute effectively to bringing peace to mankind,\r\nthanks to nations’ renewed expression of their will to\r\ncooperate in the responsible and shared task of eradicating\r\nthe drug trafficking and drug addiction that threaten their\r\nsafety and international coexistence. The danger of drug\r\ntrafficking can be summed up by saying that it is\r\nsystematically destroying things of great value that have\r\ntaken mankind centuries to build, such as health, freedom\r\nand justice.\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nImbued with that spirit of cooperation, we have come\r\nto ratify on behalf of Mexico the decision to redouble the\r\nefforts, in the framework of international solidarity fostered\r\nby the United Nations, to fight vigorously against the crimes\r\nthat derive from the various modalities of drug trafficking,\r\nto encourage actions by societies and Governments designed\r\nto reduce consumption and rates of addiction, to support\r\npreventive-education, care and treatment programmes and to\r\nstimulate scientific research and reflection in this field.\r\nNowadays, the most effective lesson that nations are\r\nbeing taught is that drugs spread when there is indecision,\r\ndisorganization and lack of coordination and cooperation\r\nbetween Governments. In order to stand up against such\r\nnegative conditions it is imperative constantly to update our\r\nknowledge of this changing phenomenon and anticipate its\r\ntrends. It is urgent, in the short term, to stop its spread and,\r\nin the long term, to eradicate it through reason and law.\r\nMexico participates actively in international efforts\r\nbeing made in this respect, and within our borders we are\r\nstrengthening more and more our organizational structures\r\nand programmes aimed at drug control, with strict\r\nobservance of legality and based on humanitarian principles\r\nof human protection and on the juridical, organic and\r\nfunctional solidity of national institutions.\r\nThe Mexican State sees mankind as the reason for and\r\ninspiration of its fundamental political decisions; that is\r\nprecisely why it bases its policy on drugs on the firm\r\nprinciple of human dignity.\r\nIn developing its public policies, the Mexican State\r\ndetermines its actions concerning drugs on the basis of the\r\nfollowing principles: First, there is the principle of\r\ncomprehensiveness, which consists of approaching the drug\r\nphenomenon as a whole and dealing with its basic causes\r\nand its infinite interconnections with other phenomena.\r\nSecondly, there is the principle of globality, because the\r\nproblem affects all nations; therefore, in order to bring it\r\nunder control, it must be approached multilaterally on the\r\nbasis of shared responsibility, within a framework of full\r\nrespect and cooperation, so that actions taken respond to\r\nhemispheric, regional, binational and local needs. Thirdly,\r\nthere is the principle of prevention, intended, through\r\neducation, to encourage critical thinking based on values\r\ncapable of fostering an attitude of rejection of drugs - an\r\nattitude strengthened by the combined efforts of society and\r\nthe educational and health sectors of government, and its\r\nscope of action is expanded through community mobilization\r\nprogrammes for drug-addiction prevention and care and\r\nrehabilitation for those who have suffered from addiction.\r\nFourthly, there is the principle of the quality of the legal,\r\ninstitutional and operational instruments aimed at stopping\r\ncrime in all its stages, uncovering any violation of human\r\nrights in the pursuit of criminals and providing treatment and\r\nsocial rehabilitation for criminals. And, fifthly, there is the\r\nprinciple of the active participation of society, both in the\r\nfight against drugs and in preventive programmes, and in the\r\nrejection of the drug culture and of coexistence with drugs,\r\nas well as in information strategies.\r\nIn the field of juridical-penal efforts, Mexico has\r\nachieved the following results in the last five years: More\r\nthan 2,300 tons of marijuana, more than 210 tons of cocaine\r\nand almost 2 tons of heroin and opium gum have been\r\nseized. At the same time, more than 60,000 hectares of\r\nmarijuana and almost 50 thousand hectares of poppies have\r\nbeen eradicated. We have also succeeded in dismantling\r\nmore than a dozen top-level criminal organizations linked to\r\ndrug trafficking and arresting 16 of their ringleaders; this has\r\nhad an impact at the continental level.\r\nFour months ago the President of Mexico created the\r\nNational Institute for the Fight against Drugs, whose mission\r\nis to give this problem specialized attention. The Institute is\r\nprovided with the most advanced technology to face up to\r\nthis scourge.\r\nMexico has come before the most representative body\r\nof the international community to stress the need to consider\r\nagain together, in a calm manner, the situation in which we\r\nfind ourselves and to redefine our actions in the drug-control\r\nfield. Only through immediate action can we achieve\r\nmedium-term or long-term solutions.\r\nIn an effort to promote international action in this area,\r\nthe purpose of the Mexican Government’s proposal that\r\nthese special meetings be held, we should like to advance\r\nsome concepts and priorities that, in our opinion, might be\r\nregarded as a basis for this exercise in international\r\nreflection.\r\nThe first is reducing demand. Since it is drug\r\nconsumption that generates production and causes drug\r\ntrafficking, reducing demand is the basic, albeit long-term,\r\nsolution. The most effective way to reduce production and\r\ntrafficking in drugs is gradually to reduce the number of\r\nconsumers. In designing new international strategies we\r\nshould consider developing integrated prevention\r\nprogrammes. Communities must be mobilized to discourage\r\nthe use of substances, especially the most addictive\r\nsubstances, through teaching in the schools and in\r\ncommunity education programmes, and to provide treatment\r\nbased on timely identification of the problem and on the\r\nrehabilitation and social reintegration of the addict.\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 7\r\nThe second concept concerns the efficacy of\r\ninternational efforts to eradicate illicit cultivation. Although\r\ndrugs are cultivated in many countries, whatever their degree\r\nof development, such cultivation is often concentrated in the\r\nleast developed countries, where an alternative to the\r\ncultivation of illicit crops might be created through\r\nimproving the living standards of those who, out of poverty,\r\nproduce and trade in drugs. Such an improvement could be\r\nachieved through rural development programmes based on\r\ninternational cooperation for development and on the\r\nprinciple of shared responsibility.\r\nThis is the traditional approach. In addition, we must\r\nrecognize that the so-called consumer countries are\r\nproducers of drugs, illegal chemical substances and large\r\nquantities of marijuana. There should be better\r\nadministrative control, and sanctions against producers and\r\nsuppliers should be rigorously applied.\r\nThirdly, we require the harmonization of national\r\nlegislation. Because the legal framework to curb drug\r\ntrafficking and related crimes is inadequate, we must\r\nharmonize national laws, in keeping with each country’s\r\ndomestic legislation, and make them compatible with\r\nexisting international instruments.\r\nSimilarly, it is essential to create new legal systems that\r\nare compatible at the international level and able to control\r\nthe vast resources that drug traffickers possess, while\r\nrecognizing that the huge profits play a central role in the\r\nsuccess and spread of drug trafficking. Therefore, both the\r\nmarket and the large flow of funds must be eliminated as a\r\nmatter of urgency. The legal systems must be able to\r\ncombat the financial machinery, tax evasion and money\r\nlaundering; confiscate the property of drug traffickers;\r\neradicate the networks used for the acquisition of weapons\r\nand explosives; prevent the transport of chemical precursors\r\nto clandestine laboratories; and, lastly, control the\r\nproduction, transportation and distribution of drugs.\r\nFourthly, there is the fight against organized crime.\r\nThe globalization of life in all its commercial, cultural,\r\ncommunication, transportation, economic and financial\r\nforms, as well as in many other aspects, has also made\r\npossible a more effective organization of criminal activities.\r\nWe must therefore review and update national and\r\ninternational legal instruments dealing with health, penal,\r\npenal-fiscal, financial and banking matters; encourage\r\nbilateral adherence to agreements on mutual legal assistance,\r\nextradition, sentencing and money laundering; ensure the\r\nexistence of adequate structures and systems of justice; and\r\nstrengthen strategic information-exchange mechanisms so as\r\nto deal more effectively with transnational criminal\r\nnetworks.\r\nFifthly, new financing machinery is required to\r\nimprove international cooperation. One of the obstacles to\r\nbetter methods of tackling the drug phenomenon is the lack\r\nof financial resources, both for the implementation of plans\r\nagreed within multilateral organizations and for national\r\nprevention and treatment and programmes to intercept drugs\r\nin transit and support rural programmes to discourage illegal\r\ncultivation. This lack of financial resources contrasts with\r\nthe vast amount of capital readily available to international\r\ndrug criminals, its easy transfer from one country to another\r\nand its almost complete freedom of use. If these\r\ncontradictions are not resolved, it is highly unlikely that\r\nUnited Nations, regional and national programmes can be\r\neffective.\r\nMultilateral credit institutions should, at the behest of\r\nthe General Assembly, support existing procedures under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme to revitalize priority national programmes. It is\r\nalso appropriate to make a firm but friendly appeal to the\r\nmost advanced countries to increase their commitment to\r\ncontribute to these goals through the Programme.\r\nThe scourge of drug trafficking must be fought with\r\ndetermination, appropriate strategies, the law, preventive\r\nprogrammes and rehabilitation programmes, better\r\norganization, technical training and perseverance. Above all,\r\nwe need international cooperation. One country alone\r\ncannot overcome this great disaster. In this field, as in few\r\nothers, cooperation, coordination and international solidarity,\r\nwith full respect for the sovereignty of States, are indispensable.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Before calling upon the next\r\nspeaker, I should like to make some announcements.\r\nFirst, I wish to express my appreciation for the\r\ncooperation of delegations in limiting their statements to\r\n10 minutes, in accordance with the Assembly’s decision in\r\nthis respect. As members know, there is still a very large\r\nnumber of speakers inscribed on the list for both today and\r\ntomorrow, and only with the continued support and\r\ncooperation of members can we ensure the smooth\r\ndiscussion of this subject matter in the time allotted.\r\nPROGRAMME OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should now like to make an\r\nannouncement in connection with an addition to our\r\nprogramme of work.\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nOn Monday, 15 November, in the afternoon, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will consider agenda item 32, \"Complete\r\nwithdrawal of foreign military forces from the territories of\r\nthe Baltic States\". The list of speakers for this item is now\r\nopen.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 112 (continued)\r\nINTERNATIONAL DRUG CONTROL\r\nHIGH-LEVEL PLENARY MEETINGS TO\r\nEXAMINE THE STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL\r\nCOOPERATION AGAINST THE ILLICIT\r\nPRODUCTION, SALES, DEMAND, TRAFFIC\r\nAND DISTRIBUTION OF NARCOTICS AND\r\nPSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES: DRAFT\r\nRESOLUTION (A/48/L.12)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on the representative of the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\nMr. RICHARDSON (United Kingdom): I should first\r\nlike to convey both to you, Mr. President, and to this\r\nA s s e m b l y , t h e v e r y s i n c e r e r e g r e t s o f\r\nMr. Mark Lennon-Boyd, the Minister in the Foreign and\r\nCommonwealth Office responsible for international drugs\r\nquestions. He had fully intended to be here today and was\r\nmuch looking forward to the occasion. Unfortunately,\r\nbecause of a last-minute illness, he had to cancel his travels\r\nand has instead asked me to make the speech that he would\r\nhave made had he been here.\r\nAt the special session of February 1990, the British\r\nForeign Secretary described the horrendous reality of the\r\ndrugs trade: the pain, misery and squalor of the addicts, the\r\ndebasement of the community, the associated violence and\r\ncriminality. He summed it up as the slave trade writ large.\r\nI cannot say that very much has changed.\r\nAfter that meeting three years ago, the World Summit\r\nin London endorsed a reorganization of those parts of the\r\nUnited Nations system concerned with drugs and the\r\nadoption of a Global Programme of Action. Other\r\ninternational initiatives have followed. At the instigation of\r\nthe leaders of the Group of 7, measures have been agreed\r\nand implemented in a number of countries to combat\r\nmoney-laundering and the illicit trading of precursor\r\nchemicals. Meetings of donor countries have done much to\r\ndevelop coordination of bilateral assistance. The Council of\r\nEurope’s Pompidou Group has taken forward cooperation\r\nbetween the two halves of the continent. I am glad to say\r\nthat the United Kingdom has been actively involved in all\r\nthese initiatives.\r\nThe Minister of Justice of Belgium has set out the great\r\nstrides taken internally by the European Community and its\r\nmember States, but perhaps I can say a few words about that\r\ntoo. The Maastricht Treaty provides something brand-new:\r\nan intergovernmental pillar to deal with interior and justice\r\nmatters, and another on the foreign and security policy side\r\nwhich operates by means of voluntary cooperation between\r\nCommunity member States to stand alongside the established\r\nEuropean Community way of doing business, in which the\r\nEuropean Commission proposes measures and the Council\r\nof Ministers decides on them. The interior and justice pillar\r\ndeals with a whole range of matters, and not just drugs. But\r\ndrug trafficking is one of the areas covered by this\r\nintergovernmental pillar, which is of most concern to our\r\ncitizens. European Community member States, working\r\nfreely together in the framework provided by this new\r\narrangement, will cooperate, through the European Police\r\nAgency - EUROPOL - and other means to combat this\r\nscourge.\r\nOn the bilateral level, we have also sought to give\r\npractical effect to this multilateral work: we have negotiated\r\nasset seizure agreements, established operational cooperation\r\nwith a wide range of countries, developed programmes of\r\ntraining and assistance in law enforcement, and provided\r\nexpert advice on demand reduction.\r\nRegrettably, however, the result of all these efforts has\r\nbeen disappointing. At a global level, the production of\r\ncocaine may have levelled off, but there are signs that even\r\nthis modest achievement may not last. In the case of heroin,\r\nwe cannot even claim a levelling off, as a continuing\r\nincrease in supply feeds a corresponding growth in demand.\r\nOne particularly pernicious aspect of this inexorable rise in\r\ndemand is a mushrooming addiction in countries where\r\ndrugs are produced and through which they pass.\r\nThis somewhat bleak picture is moreover replicated in\r\nour own experience at the regional and national levels. For\r\nexample, there is evidence of a significant increase in the\r\nimport of cocaine into Europe, as demand elsewhere has\r\nbeen met. In my own country, there is a particular concern\r\nabout the spread, particularly in urban areas, of the cocaine\r\nderivative known as crack.\r\nThere are wider political developments which have\r\nperversely added to the world’s drug problems. The end of\r\nthe cold war and the consequent liberalization of the\r\nsocieties and economies of Eastern Europe and the former\r\nSoviet Union are of course thoroughly welcome. But as old\r\nstructures of law enforcement have come down before new\r\nones have been fully established, a vacuum has been created\r\nin which drug trafficking, and indeed production, has flour-\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 9\r\nished. The result has been a further diversification of an\r\nalready highly diversified trade. A similar vacuum exists\r\nand is growing in parts of South-West Asia.\r\nBut the political sea change of the 1990s is not the\r\nwhole story. Elsewhere too the commitment called for from\r\nthe international community in 1990 has not emerged. Little\r\nprogress has been made against the uncontrolled production\r\nof heroin that we have seen for many years in parts of\r\nSouth-East Asia. Nearly five years after its adoption, barely\r\na half of the Member States are parties to the 1988 United\r\nNations Convention on narcotic drugs, and some of those\r\nstill lack the domestic legislation needed to fulfil its\r\nsubstantial obligations. Nor has nearly enough use been\r\nmade of the potential of the United Nations system to tackle\r\nthe drugs threat. We must all pay more than lip service to\r\nthe System-Wide Action Plan. The position is the same with\r\nthe Global Programme of Action. It will have meaning only\r\nif all countries play their part. It was particularly\r\ndiscouraging, therefore, that only 28 countries responded to\r\nthe United Nations International Drug Control Programme’s\r\n(UNDCP) questionnaire on implementation. As a\r\nconsequence, the key document before this session, the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/48/329), reflects the views and\r\nexperiences of less than one-sixth of the membership.\r\nThis all adds up to a situation that is no less stark than\r\nit was three years ago. I have heard it said in recent weeks\r\nthat we need to revamp the United Nations drug-control\r\nmachinery again and create new mechanisms. I do not\r\nagree. We have the machinery; we need now to make it\r\nwork better. In particular, we need a more solid\r\ninternational front in support of the 1988 United Nations\r\nConvention. This is an instrument with teeth, and we need\r\nto make it bite. The other half of the membership must sign\r\nup.\r\nWe also need a fuller realization of the role we have\r\nassigned to UNDCP as the focal point of international action\r\nagainst drugs. Although a new programme, it has shown\r\nwhat it can do. It deserves the fullest cooperation wherever\r\nit is engaged in front-line efforts against drugs. We should\r\ninvest in development of UNDCP rather than in new\r\ninitiatives. We should make sure that it has the autonomy\r\nit needs. It deserves full support more generally from\r\ninstitutions within and outside the United Nations system.\r\nWithin that system, and from the international financial\r\nbodies, we need a more substantial engagement of other\r\nagencies that can help. Much development activity takes\r\nplace against a background of drugs production or drugs\r\ntrafficking. Greater account needs to be taken of that\r\ndimension. This is as much in the interests of economic and\r\nsocial progress as for any narrower reason.\r\nElsewhere, we need to make a conscious effort to make\r\nfull use of the potential of the other mechanisms. In doing\r\nso we should bear in mind the consensus reached earlier that\r\nthe international effort must be properly balanced: balanced\r\nbetween producer, transit and consumer countries, and\r\nbalanced between supply reduction, law enforcement and\r\ndemand reduction. Neglect of any one of these components\r\nwill erode to a disproportionate extent the overall\r\neffectiveness of the strategy to which we have committed\r\nourselves and which these meetings will, we hope, re--\r\nendorse.\r\nBut, although international mechanisms can help, the\r\nprimary responsibility for action remains with national\r\nGovernments and parliaments. It is only they who can\r\ninitiate action to break up drug-trafficking networks,\r\neliminate drug production and reduce drug addiction. To do\r\nthis requires courage and commitment at the highest political\r\nlevel, reflected down through the layers of government and\r\nadministration. In practical terms, this means strengthening\r\nthe law of the land to cover, for example, asset seizure,\r\ncriminalization of money-laundering, and precursor-chemical\r\ncontrol, and then enforcing the law in some cases in the face\r\nof infiltration by criminal networks into the heart of\r\ndemocratic institutions. If we do not have the determination\r\nto take on the powerful interests behind the drugs trade, they\r\nwill entrench their positions in our societies, to the cost of\r\nus all.\r\nThe priority of this issue cannot be in doubt. The way\r\nwe tackle it has implications for future generations. The\r\npolitical circumstances of the 1990s give us an\r\nunprecedented opportunity to make cooperation between\r\nnations and across regions work and to create the wider\r\nunited front to which I have referred. But the precondition\r\nfor international success is will and effort at the national\r\nlevel. We owe it to each other to do what is necessary both\r\nin the global arena and at home.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Mr. Edward Lintner,\r\nNational Commissioner for Narcotic Drugs and\r\nParliamentary State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of the\r\nInterior of Germany.\r\nMr. LINTNER (Germany) (spoke in German; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): In my capacity as the\r\nGerman Government’s Commissioner for Drug Control, I am\r\ngratified that the United Nations, by means of these four\r\nplenary meetings of the General Assembly attended by\r\nhigh-ranking participants, again professes its determination\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nto proscribe drug abuse before the world’s public. This is\r\nthe objective we have to pursue jointly.\r\nThe Belgian Minister for Justice and Economic Affairs,\r\nMr. Melchior Wathelet, this morning presented major aspects\r\nof the international fight against drugs, as the joint position\r\nof the European Community and its member States. Please\r\nallow me to deal with some additional issues from the\r\nviewpoint of my country.\r\nThe scope of drug-related crime has markedly increased\r\nin Germany over the past few years. In 1992 alone the\r\nGerman enforcement authorities seized 5.9 tons of hard\r\ndrugs and more than 12 tons of cannabis products. In spite\r\nof this significant success, it is most deplorable that, as in\r\nthe previous year, we had to register in 1992 more than\r\n2,000 deaths from drug abuse. This year, there has been a\r\n20 per cent decrease in drug-related deaths so far. However,\r\none cannot speak of a downward trend, for there are too\r\nmany factors that might influence this development. It is true\r\nthat the number of first-time users of hard drugs is declining\r\nas well - above all with regard to heroin. But there is an\r\nalarming increase in first-time cocaine and amphetamine\r\nusers, a development we observe with great concern.\r\nOver the past 12 months, Germany has taken major\r\nsteps designed to optimize the fight against this scourge of\r\nhumanity. In addition to other legislative measures taken,\r\nmoney laundering was declared a punishable offence in\r\nSeptember 1992. A Money Laundering Act was adopted last\r\nmonth, providing the prosecuting authorities with an\r\nessential instrument for successfully countering money\r\nlaundering. The Act on the Control of Precursor Substances\r\nin the field of chemicals is about to be submitted to\r\nParliament.\r\nHowever, the emphasis of our anti-drug policy is not\r\nonly on repression. We consider it our most fundamental\r\ntask to convince people, especially the young, that it is better\r\nto lead a life without drugs and drug addiction in free\r\nself-determination. To this end, we have to start at an early\r\nage and appeal to those who are potentially at risk. One of\r\nour new concepts, which aims at reducing the death rate, is\r\nreaching out to drug addicts with no strings attached. A\r\npilot programme, started in 1990, seeks to address drug\r\naddicts by means other than formal counselling and therapy,\r\nwithout asking them to meet any prerequisites or make\r\nadvance concessions. The programme is designed to provide\r\nassistance in everyday life and end the calamitous cycle of\r\naddiction and impoverishment.\r\nFor the time being, more than 4,000 specialized places\r\nare available in long-term therapy centres. The development\r\nand extension of existing in-patient facilities for\r\ndetoxification and therapy, as well as the creation of new\r\nones, will be carried on in the future. Finally, we are\r\ncontinuing with other proven programmes for counselling,\r\ntreatment and follow-up care, such as assistance in\r\nrehabilitation and social and vocational integration.\r\nIn the field of demand reduction, campaigns in the mass\r\nmedia as well as prevention activities in areas with drug\r\nproblems have been successful. In particular, our drug\r\nprevention programmes at schools often entail local\r\nfollow-up activities. However, it is indispensable for\r\nsustained success in reducing the demand for drugs that drug\r\nprevention is seen as a challenge to the entire society. This\r\nis why I am at present seeking to establish an association\r\nfunded and run by industrial sponsors and committed social\r\ngroups which will implement various and, above all, long-\r\n-term action for anti-drug education programmes.\r\nAs regards measures to reduce the cultivation of\r\nnarcotic drug plants - another essential element of our\r\nanti-drug policy - we primarily rely on the multifaceted\r\ninstrument of development aid, which is designed to provide\r\nalternatives for earning a living other than by cultivating\r\nplants for the production of drugs. We are all well aware\r\nthat a multitude of difficulties have to be overcome before\r\nan acceptable and income-producing market will have been\r\ncreated for appropriate licit produce.\r\nThe formerly popular concept of crop substitution is no\r\nlonger viable; it can no longer be our objective simply to\r\nsubstitute licit plants for illicit crops. Instead, the aim\r\nshould also be to improve the social environment by means\r\nof development policy approaches, in order to reduce the\r\nacceptance of the cultivation of illicit crops.\r\nAs holds true in the field of drug problems in general,\r\nthe fight against the abuse of narcotic drugs is an\r\ninternational task which can only be coped with through the\r\njoint responsibility of all States. The United Nations\r\nConventions on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,\r\nthe Global Programme of Action and the United Nations\r\nSystem-Wide Action Plan on Drug Abuse Control constitute\r\na sound and comprehensive basis for drug control activities.\r\nWhat is needed now is a consistent implementation of these\r\nmeasures.\r\nIn this context let me underline the central importance\r\nof the United Nations International Drug Control Programme\r\n(UNDCP). Under the management of Executive Director\r\nGiacomelli, UNDCP has made encouraging progress in the\r\nvarious fields of international drug control. I wish to point\r\nout two focal areas to which Germany, now as before,\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 11\r\nattaches special importance: UNDCP’s national master plan\r\nconcept, which has been revitalized and further developed,\r\nand technical assistance for States in the field of legislation,\r\nwhich has been intensified. In this field particularly, the\r\nStates of Central and Eastern Europe and of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) have special\r\nneeds. These countries have to establish effective anti-drug\r\nlegislation and enforcement authorities. This is of very\r\nspecial concern to us, and we would appreciate it if more\r\nStates would join in and actively engage in providing\r\nassistance to this region.\r\nWe can also thank UNDCP for essential progress in\r\nsharpening the awareness that demand reduction cannot be\r\nthe responsibility of the respective Governments alone but\r\nmust be seen as a task to be tackled by the whole society.\r\nThis means that non-governmental organizations must be\r\nincreasingly involved at the national and international levels,\r\nand the same applies to other United Nations agencies in this\r\nfield, such as the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF), the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the\r\nWorld Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural\r\nDevelopment (IFAD). The German Government will\r\ncontinue to support UNDCP’s important coordination function.\r\nThe German Government will complete the ratification\r\nof the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic\r\nin Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances within the\r\nnext few days by depositing the instrument of ratification\r\nwith the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Against\r\nthis background, I should like to underline that I consider it\r\nextremely important that all countries, irrespective of how\r\nthey are affected by the drug problem, should also ratify this\r\nConvention.\r\nHowever, appeals alone are no longer sufficient. The\r\nfight against drugs must not be fought in an overly\r\nadministrative and bureaucratic manner. It is not enough to\r\nset up just another subcommittee, to keep on preparing\r\nanalyses the results of which have long been known, to\r\nidentify ever new ifs and buts - because the outcome of all\r\nthat will be that drug control will continue to be dealt with\r\ninadequately.\r\nThe determination to combat drugs in the producer and\r\ntransit countries as well as in the consumer countries must\r\nbe maintained and developed. We do not want simply to\r\nstick to our repressive tools for combating illicit drugs; we\r\nare also determined to apply them in practice. Germany will\r\ntherefore continue to treat dealing in illicit soft and hard\r\ndrugs as a punishable criminal offence. Furthermore, our\r\ncapacity to interrupt effectively the influx and trafficking\r\nroutes of narcotic drugs must not be kept at the present\r\nlevel, but must be enhanced.\r\nI believe that we do have a chance of reducing the drug\r\nproblem. However, this will require that we attack the\r\nproblem with even greater determination. To this end we\r\nmust cooperate and mobilize all national and international\r\nefforts. Everybody is invited to join in.\r\nT h e P R E S I D E N T : I n o w c a l l o n\r\nMr. Vitor Feytor Pinto, High Commissioner for \"Project\r\nLife\" - National Plan for Drug Control.\r\nMr. FEYTOR PINTO (Portugal) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): It is a great honour for me to represent my country\r\nas High Commissioner for \"Project Life\" - National Plan for\r\nDrug Control - and to address the Assembly to report on the\r\nrole played by Portugal in all United Nations efforts to\r\ncombat illicit trafficking in and abusive consumption of\r\ndrugs.\r\nIn a society dominated by success, money and power,\r\nit is urgent to instill the values of solidarity, sharing and\r\nservice, not only to combat the exploitation of the human\r\nbeing caused by drug trafficking but also to free all those\r\nwho have fallen victim to it and who wish, often in vain, to\r\nbe able to live a life worthy of the human person.\r\nIndeed, with regard to the drug problem, the\r\nineffectiveness of the system of control and surveillance that\r\nhas been established is giving rise to great concern on the\r\npart of the international community - hence this opportunity\r\nto evaluate results and to introduce possible adjustments into\r\nintervention strategies, so as not to dash the hopes raised at\r\nthe time of its adoption by consensus in 1990.\r\nIn this regard, I am very pleased to convey Portugal’s\r\ngratitude for the growing effort in this field on the part of\r\nthe United Nations and the General Assembly, and to\r\nexpress the wholehearted support of my country for this\r\nundertaking.\r\nThis leading role - a necessity, given the complexity of\r\nthe phenomenon and its truly world-wide dimensions, and a\r\nmajor factor in providing the cooperation required at the\r\nworld and regional levels - will thus guarantee the\r\neffectiveness of measures to be adopted and encourage\r\naction by all local and national leaders who share\r\nresponsibility in the vital struggle to overcome the drug\r\nproblem.\r\nWith greater determination and courage the Assembly\r\nis today tackling the delicate but decisive task of evaluating\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe results of earlier initiatives, particularly the adoption of\r\nthe Global Programme of Action and other elements in the\r\nPolitical Declaration approved at the seventeenth special\r\nsession in 1990.\r\nWe wish here to congratulate the Secretary-General on\r\nhis important report on the implementation of the Global\r\nProgramme of Action by various Member States and to\r\nexpress our support for the recommendations contained\r\ntherein.\r\nWe recognize that the drug situation throughout the\r\nworld has continued to deteriorate; and we believe that it is\r\nour duty to express our admiration for and solidarity with\r\nthose States that have with such determination taken bold\r\nmeasures in the areas of prevention and the treatment of\r\naddicts and with regard to illicit trafficking, as well as within\r\nthe system of control and curbing supply.\r\nRegionally and domestically, Portugal has striven to\r\napply the measures in the Global Programme of Action, and\r\nwe are now attempting to evaluate the extent of\r\nimplementation.\r\nWithin the framework of the European Community, of\r\nwhich it is a member, Portugal has contributed to the\r\nelaboration of concerted strategy in the European Programme\r\nfor Drug Control, which, by giving pride of place to\r\nreducing demand, is advocating the strengthening of police\r\nand customs structures, providing for cooperation and\r\nsupport instruments at the international level, particularly\r\nwith the producer countries, and taking legislative measures\r\nto prevent the laundering of proceeds from illicit trafficking.\r\nInasmuch as the statement of the Belgian Minister of\r\nJustice made on behalf of the European Community has\r\nreported on the Community’s achievements and strategies, I\r\nshall confine myself to endorsing wholeheartedly the views\r\nexpressed therein.\r\nStill at the regional level, within the broader framework\r\nof the Council of Europe, Portugal shares in the\r\nachievements of the Council’s Pompidou Group, whose work\r\nis an important contribution to realizing measures adopted by\r\nthe various countries in Europe.\r\nIn strictly domestic terms, in 1990 Portugal updated its\r\nNational Drug Programme in keeping with the Global\r\nProgramme of Action, and this updating dealt with\r\nlegislation and control structures, including direct action.\r\nIn the legislative realm, after the ratification of the 1988\r\nConvention, we adopted national legislation making it a\r\ncrime to launder the proceeds from illicit trafficking,\r\ninstituting precursor control and providing machinery for\r\njudicial cooperation.\r\nWith regard to the structures, modifications are\r\nreflected in the creation of an Inter-Ministerial Coordination\r\nCommission presided over by the Prime Minister and\r\ndesigned to make control much more effective.\r\nAs to direct action, we have strengthened the action\r\nmodels of the public services entrusted with reducing\r\ndemand - health and education - and with the control of\r\nsupply - police and customs - and we have enhanced the\r\nparticipation of community non-governmental organizations,\r\nwhose work in the prevention of drug use and the treatment\r\nof addicts is now receiving increased State aid.\r\nIn such a strategy, preventing drug use among young\r\npeople, which is a priority area of action, has been addressed\r\nthrough systematic activity focused on schools within the\r\neducational system, with the participation of students,\r\nteachers, parents and the surrounding community.\r\nThe results have been particularly encouraging in that\r\nfirst-time drug use among young people within the school\r\nsystem has seen no increase and remains at what can be\r\nconsidered to be low levels - below 10 per cent for first-time\r\nuse.\r\nIn the area of treatment, all efforts have been\r\nconcentrated on expanding the network of assistance centres\r\nto respond to current demand. The low rate of success of\r\navailable therapeutic models, the growing number of addicts\r\nseeking help and the increase of HIV carriers are causes for\r\nconcern and require that greater investment in this area,\r\nimmediately and in the short term, be made within the\r\nframework of the National Health System.\r\nAs to the question of the control and suppression of\r\nillicit trafficking, pressure is constantly rising owing to\r\nincreased use of sea routes by traffickers - it must not be\r\nforgotten that Portugal is a port of entry into the European\r\nCommunity - and efforts have focused on strengthening the\r\npolice and customs systems and increasing regional and\r\ninternational cooperation. So long as the current imbalanced\r\nconditions remain, ever-increasing means and the allocation\r\nof new though necessarily limited resources will be the only\r\noptions available to us.\r\nIf the international community is to succeed in\r\ncontrolling the production, distribution and use of drugs by\r\nthe end of this decade, it will be essential for Member States\r\nand the United Nations to redouble their efforts effectively\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 13\r\nto implement the Global Programme of Action. As for\r\nPortugal, it will pursue its efforts to implement the\r\nProgramme’s measures and will intensify them in the areas\r\nwhere intervention has proven less effective - particularly in\r\nthe area of the rehabilitation and social reintegration of\r\naddicts in general and prisoners in particular, and in the\r\nrealm of the prevention and suppression of illicit trafficking.\r\nIt will continue its participation at the regional level in the\r\nEuropean Community and within the Council of Europe - in\r\nthe Pompidou Group - stepping up international cooperation\r\nso as best to achieve the desired goals.\r\nFor us, it is essential that the United Nations pursue its\r\nrole as a mobilizer of public opinion in general and among\r\nMember States in particular by encouraging and supporting\r\npractical implementation of the Programme’s measures. It\r\nis also vital that the Programme of Action be more actively\r\npursued within the United Nations system and that it benefit\r\nfrom a more clear-cut contribution from the relevant\r\norganizations, particularly the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, the World Health\r\nOrganization and the International Labour Organization in\r\nimplementing the measures contained therein. Lastly, the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme must\r\ncontinue to guide the work of the United Nations in this area\r\nat the operational level with the dynamism it has always\r\nshown, and it must receive the resources necessary to carry\r\nout its work.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Mr. Lee P. Brown,\r\nDirector of the Office of National Drug Control Policy of\r\nthe United States of America.\r\nMr. BROWN (United States of America): It is my\r\npleasure, on behalf of the United States, to address this\r\nAssembly on the subject of narcotics.\r\nWe have arrived here today from many corners of the\r\nglobe. We come from many different nations and cultures.\r\nAnd yet we face a common threat: the international drug\r\ntrade and the international criminal organizations involved in\r\ndrug production and trafficking around the world. The\r\nthreat endangers our countries, our communities, ourselves\r\nand our children, generating in its wake crime, violence,\r\ncorruption, environmental degradation, social decay and\r\nimmense personal misery.\r\nToday, I would like to tell the Assembly about the\r\nnature of the drug situation we now face in the United\r\nStates. On the positive side, the number of Americans who\r\nuse drugs occasionally has declined markedly. In 1979,\r\n24 million individuals had used some illicit drug at least\r\nonce in the previous 30 days; last year, however, only\r\n11.4 million did so. And the number of Americans who\r\nused cocaine on a current basis dropped from 5.8 million in\r\n1985 to 1.3 million in 1992 - a remarkable decline of nearly\r\n80 per cent over a seven-year period.\r\nBut other data give us cause for real concern. Drug use\r\nby hard-core users has remained essentially unchanged for\r\nthe past seven years, resistant to all efforts to reduce the\r\nnumber of users. In fact, the use of cocaine seems to be\r\nconstant or increasing. Our country’s chronic users also\r\nappear to be getting sicker. New data show a 10 per cent\r\nnationwide increase in drug-related hospital visits between\r\n1991 and 1992. There was an 18 per cent increase in\r\nhospital visits due to cocaine; heroin-related episodes showed\r\nan even more dramatic increase of 34 per cent.\r\nThe new data indicate to us that the drug epidemic that\r\nbegan in the late 1970s is becoming increasingly\r\nconcentrated among the nation’s heaviest users. Clearly, we\r\nhave a long way to go before we can claim success in our\r\nfight against drug use.\r\nLast week, we released our response to the drug threat:\r\nthe Interim National Drug Control Strategy. This Strategy\r\nhas been designed to give new direction to and reinvigorate\r\nour national efforts to combat the drug problem. The\r\nInterim Strategy differs from past strategies in a number of\r\nimportant ways. It seeks to deter new, high levels of\r\nfirst-time drug use by aiming prevention programmes at\r\nhigh-risk populations. It targets hard-core drug users for\r\ntreatment to reduce their drug use and its consequences. It\r\nemphasizes the importance of community drug- and\r\nviolence-control activities. It promotes the certainty of swift,\r\nappropriate punishment for drug offenders. It supports\r\nresearch, and programmes that research proves to be\r\neffective.\r\nThe Strategy maintains a commitment to certain basic\r\nprecepts. One is that we must continue to fight drugs\r\ncomprehensively with programmes that attack both the\r\nsupply of drugs to and within the United States as well as\r\nthose that address our domestic drug demand. Our support\r\nfor the efforts of countries that demonstrate the political will\r\nto end drug production and trafficking will continue.\r\nAnother is that the possession and use of illicit drugs will\r\nremain acts subject to appropriate punishment by criminal\r\nlaw. The legalization or decriminalization of the use of\r\ndrugs would entail more users and even more severe\r\nconsequences. That is unacceptable.\r\nIn the end, our national goal remains the reduction of\r\nthe overall demand for drugs in America. Our Interim\r\nStrategy will proceed along four basic tracks.\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nFirst, it concentrates on demand reduction. Its\r\ncentre-piece is an aggressive drug treatment strategy with\r\nhard-core drug use as its primary target.\r\nSecondly, it focuses on the reduction of drug-related\r\nviolence and the control and prevention of crime. We will\r\npursue a comprehensive approach to criminal violence and\r\nseek innovative solutions that can be shown to be effective,\r\nincluding in particular those that involve our communities.\r\nThirdly, it supports the empowerment of our\r\ncommunities. We believe it is fundamentally important to\r\nhave communities resist drug trafficking and use.\r\nFourthly, it calls for the United States to continue\r\ninternational leadership in and support for international drug-\r\ncontrol actions. We believe that the international drug trade\r\nis a direct threat to the United States, undercutting our\r\ndomestic efforts to reduce drug supply and demand.\r\nTo respond to the drug threat, we will build and\r\nstrengthen the enforcement and judicial institutions needed\r\nto defeat it. With regard to interdiction, the United States\r\nwill focus more on efforts in the source countries, rather\r\nthan on tracking and seizing drugs in transit.\r\nFinally, we will emphasize the need to attack the drug-\r\ntrafficking organizations themselves.\r\nIn short, we will use every available means to reduce\r\ndrug supply and demand within the United States, and to\r\nbuild strong, cooperative relationships with other countries\r\nthat demonstrate the will to fight drugs. A strong\r\nmultilateral approach is needed if we are to get the job done.\r\nThe narcotics cartels do more than simply buy and sell\r\ndrugs. They can buy and sell and terrorize Governments\r\ntoo. They are sophisticated, highly adaptive, multinational\r\norganizations. We must attack the narcotics cartels from\r\nstrong regional and multilateral defences.\r\nAnd, given the fiscal constraints that all nations face, it\r\nis imperative that we coordinate our efforts and our\r\nresources, and make the most of what we have.\r\nMr. Bull (Liberia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nWe recognize that much has been done already, and\r\nthat the foundation is in place from which to build further\r\ncooperation. The United Nations, principally through the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme\r\n(UNDCP), but increasingly through other agencies, is a vital\r\npartner in combating the global threat. Under its Executive\r\nDirector’s leadership, UNDCP has become the linchpin of\r\ninternational drug-control efforts.\r\nWe have a responsibility to sustain the high-level\r\ninternational commitment and resources for drug control on\r\nboth national and international levels. My own Government\r\nbelieves in action, not just words; and therefore we are\r\ndoubling our 1993 contribution to UNDCP: our 1993\r\ncontribution is $6.2 million.\r\nThere is an increasingly important need for a strong\r\nUnited Nations system. The United Nations agencies with\r\nrelated responsibilities cannot ignore the impact of narcotics\r\nproduction, trafficking and use. The United Nations is not\r\njust a peace-keeping or peacemaking body: it also is a\r\nforum for calling attention to the enemies of democracy and\r\ncalling for action against them. Let us make it an effective\r\nforum.\r\nI ask several things of this series of meetings: first,\r\nthat we leave here today resolved to condemn international\r\ndrug trafficking, to seek full ratification of the 1988 Vienna\r\nConvention, and to go beyond that to help all nations enact\r\nthe legislation and develop the institutions that will achieve\r\nthe Convention’s goals; secondly, that we intensify the attack\r\non the trafficking organizations by targeting our efforts at\r\nthe kingpins that head them; thirdly, that we urge increased\r\nemphasis on targeting the profits and the money-laundering\r\noperations of traffickers, developing and executing effective\r\nuniform maritime interdiction procedures, and enforcing\r\nchemical controls; fourthly, that we resolve to intensify our\r\nmultilateral and regional approaches, to share our resources\r\nand to coordinate our assistance; and, finally, that all\r\nGovernments resolve to support efforts further to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations System-Wide Action Plan on Drug Abuse\r\nControl. The scope of the drug problem is so vast that we\r\nmust energize the entire United Nations system. We must\r\nalso urge the international financial institutions to play a\r\ngreater role in stopping the drug trade.\r\nIn this post-cold-war era, our countries are no longer\r\nhaunted by the threat of nuclear destruction. And yet this is\r\nno time for complacency. With the end of the cold war, the\r\nsecurity of nations is threatened by other insidious and\r\npowerful enemies of democracy and freedom. Narcotics\r\ntrafficking and other global crimes corrupt and undermine\r\nthe basic institutions that underpin democracy and promote\r\npolitical freedom: the rule of law and free and open\r\neconomies.\r\nThe United States will not shrink from its leadership\r\nrole in the attack against international drug and crime\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 15\r\nsyndicates. We call upon the community of nations to stand\r\nup to this threat collectively.\r\nWith the international community’s renewed and\r\nsustained commitment to the rule of law, we will prevail.\r\nIndeed, as this is an issue of simple responsibility - to\r\nourselves and to our children - we have no other choice.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call next on His Excellency\r\nMr. Shozo Azuma, Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Japan.\r\nMr. AZUMA (Japan): I wish first of all, on behalf of\r\nthe Government and the people of Japan, to convey my\r\nheartfelt congratulations to Ambassador Insanally, who is\r\ncarrying out the important task of presiding over the General\r\nAssembly at this session, including these plenary meetings\r\nof the Assembly that have been convened to consider the\r\nquestion of narcotic drugs. I am confident that his wealth of\r\nexperience and his keen insight will ensure that these will be\r\nvery productive meetings. For its part, the Japanese\r\ndelegation will be unstinting in its cooperation as\r\nAmbassador Insanally carries out his solemn responsibilities.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nToday narcotic drugs are found in all parts of the world\r\nand are therefore a worldwide problem, threatening the\r\nhealth and well-being of people everywhere. In recent years,\r\nthe number of drug addicts has been rising rapidly in the\r\nproducing countries, the transit countries, and the consuming\r\ncountries alike. This gives rise to a very serious situation\r\nthat puts down deep roots in the lives of people. The\r\nproblems of narcotic drugs cannot be solved by one country,\r\nwhether it be a producing, consuming or transit country; the\r\nproblems are universal, and if an effective solution is to be\r\nfound the participation of all countries in the quest for a\r\nsolution is required. In order to build a new international\r\ncommunity in this post-cold-war era that can enable us to\r\nstrengthen the foundations of peace, we must give greater\r\nimportance to promoting international cooperation to solve\r\nthe drug problem.\r\nIn that connection, the Global Programme of Action\r\nadopted at the special session of the General Assembly held\r\nin 1990, devoted to the question of narcotic drugs, is\r\nimportant and significant, for it provides a common base for\r\nsuch an international effort. It is the duty of each State\r\nMember of the United Nations to do its best to implement\r\nthe Programme.\r\nJapan understands how important it is for Member\r\nStates to strengthen balanced measures against narcotic drugs\r\nin the areas of law enforcement and reduction of supply and\r\ndemand. For this reason, Japan has exerted every effort to\r\nmake the adjustments in its legal system necessary to\r\nimplement the Global Programme of Action.\r\nIn October 1991 the Government of Japan passed two\r\nlaws to facilitate ratification of the United Nations\r\nConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\r\nPsychotropic Substances, which was adopted in December\r\n1988. In June 1992 Japan duly ratified the Convention.\r\nSince that time, with the help of its dedicated law\r\nenforcement authorities, Japan has proceeded steadily to\r\nimplement the provisions of the Convention.\r\nFurther, this year as part of the United Nations Decade\r\nagainst Drug Abuse, which is one of the proposals embodied\r\nin the Global Programme of Action, Japan launched an\r\neducation and public information campaign called: \"No,\r\nabsolutely No!\". Japan is also actively participating in the\r\nUnited Nations fund campaign against drugs in order to\r\ncontribute to non-governmental organizations that have\r\nundertaken programmes in this area.\r\nAlthough Japan has been relatively fortunate in the\r\nextent of its drug problem, in recent years the smuggling of\r\ncocaine into the country from Latin America is a cause of\r\ngrowing concern. If international trafficking in drugs is to\r\nbe controlled more effectively, Japan recognizes that each\r\ncountry must not only pursue greater efforts to interdict such\r\ntraffic at the point of entry but also contribute to\r\ninternational efforts to stem illegal drug activities in the\r\nproducing and transit countries. From this perspective, I\r\nsincerely urge all Member States to promote the\r\nimplementation of the Global Programme of Action and\r\nthereby strengthen international cooperation.\r\nJapan considers that it is imperative to establish an\r\neffective international cooperation system through which the\r\ninternational community as a whole can combat this drug\r\nmenace and, for its part, Japan is prepared to continue to\r\ncontribute to this endeavour commensurate with its status in\r\nthe world community.\r\nTo achieve the aims of the Global Programme of\r\nAction, Japan is also pursuing other measures.\r\nFirst, it will share its experience and expertise in the\r\narea of drug control with other nations. As it believes that\r\nhuman resources development in the area of law\r\nenforcement is particularly important effectively to control\r\nillegal drug-related activities, Japan has invited people in this\r\narea from all regions of the world to participate in seminars\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nin Japan on the handling of drug-related offences and will\r\ncontinue to do so in the future.\r\nSecondly, Japan has recognized that it is necessary to\r\nstrengthen the support it provides to the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), which, as\r\nthe organization responsible for drug control activities within\r\nthe United Nations system and the international community,\r\nhas played such an important role in the war against drugs.\r\nJapan has strengthened its support for this Programme.\r\nIn this regard, considering the importance of taking\r\neffective action at the subregional level, Japan advocated the\r\nformation of a subregional centre for drug control at the\r\nTokyo Meeting of Senior Officials on Drug Abuse Issues in\r\nAsia and the Pacific held in February 1991. As a result, the\r\nUNDCP Regional Centre duly commenced operation in\r\nBangkok in March last year. This Centre has already\r\ncontributed, for example, to the creation of a subregional\r\nstrategy to coordinate anti-drug activities in the area known\r\nas the Golden Triangle and in China by helping to secure the\r\nsignatures of the Governments of Thailand, Myanmar and\r\nChina on bilateral agreements relating to the control of\r\ndrugs. Japan will continue to support the UNDCP, including\r\nthis Regional Centre.\r\nThirdly, Japan believes that economic and social\r\ndevelopment is indispensable to reduce the supply of drugs\r\nfrom the producing countries, and it has, accordingly,\r\nextended support for development programmes related to\r\nachieving a supply reduction in areas such as Asia and Latin\r\nAmerica. Japan will continue to contribute to efforts to\r\nstrengthen alternative development programmes in the\r\nproducing countries so as to improve the economic and\r\nsocial environment and lessen their dependence on drug\r\nproduction.\r\nI should now like to suggest several measures that\r\nMember States might take to turn the tide against illegal\r\ndrug trafficking.\r\nFirst, in concert with the non-governmental\r\norganizations, we must strengthen our efforts to reduce\r\ndemand through education and public information activities\r\nagainst drug abuse. In recent years drug use has increased\r\nnot only in the consuming countries but also in the\r\nproducing and transit countries, and a strengthening of such\r\neducation and public information activities is vital. Japan\r\nbelieves that government-related activities are not sufficient,\r\nand it considers collaboration with the private sector\r\nindispensable. In fact, the educational campaign called \"No,\r\nabsolutely No!\", to which I referred earlier, was launched\r\nand sponsored by the Drug Abuse Prevention Centre, a\r\nJapanese non-governmental organization. This campaign has\r\nproven to be very successful, thanks to the support of this\r\nnon-governmental organization and the public. In like\r\nmanner, Japan urges the Governments of all Member States\r\nto mobilize their resources and those of their\r\nnon-governmental organizations to mount stronger and even\r\nmore effective campaigns.\r\nSecondly, a subregional approach, which I cited a\r\nmoment ago, should be pursued, with UNDCP regional\r\ncentres established around the globe. Our anti-drug struggle,\r\nparticularly if it is to be fought within regions that also\r\nencompass producing and transit countries, requires not only\r\nthe individual efforts of each State but also the cooperation\r\nof neighbouring States with common borders. If we are to\r\nmake progress in this area, each Member State must promote\r\nsuch subregional and regional cooperation, including the\r\nestablishment of UNDCP regional centres, as we have done\r\nin South-East Asia.\r\nThirdly, I should like to emphasize the need for\r\nimproved communication and closer consultation and\r\ncooperation between the Member States. At present, the\r\nonly global policy-making forum on narcotic drugs in which\r\nMember States participate is the annual session of the\r\nCommission on Narcotic Drugs. Japan therefore suggests\r\nthat the role of this Commission as a policy-making body be\r\nstrengthened through the establishment of an ad hoc group\r\nof narcotic-control experts to guide us with their valuable\r\nknowledge.\r\nFourthly, we need to build a stronger international base\r\nfrom which to prosecute our war against narcotic-drug abuse\r\nand illicit trafficking. The ratification and implementation\r\nof the 1988 United Nations Convention is not proceeding as\r\nit should. This is due, in large part, to defects in the\r\nregulatory systems of certain countries. Japan therefore\r\nurges all Member States that have not yet done so to make\r\nevery effort to adopt and implement a national regulatory\r\nsystem and then to ratify the Convention so that better\r\nprogress may be made towards achieving our common goal.\r\nI hope that we shall be able to make great and speedy\r\nprogress in our endeavours to solve this problem.\r\nThese plenary meetings provide us with a unique\r\nopportunity to discuss the implementation of the Global\r\nProgramme of Action and to formulate real measures that we\r\nare willing to pursue together. My delegation hopes that we\r\nshall achieve this goal and, in so doing, reaffirm our\r\ndetermination to gain the upper hand in our struggle against\r\nthree evils: the illicit production of, trafficking in and abuse\r\nof narcotic drugs.\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 17\r\nT h e P R E S I D E N T : I n o w c a l l\r\nMr. Chandrashekara Murthy, Minister of State for Finance\r\nof the Government of India.\r\nMr. MURTHY (India): I am pleased to participate in\r\nthese high-level plenary meetings of the forty-eighth session\r\nof the General Assembly to examine the status of\r\ninternational cooperation against the illicit production, sale,\r\ndemand, traffic and distribution of narcotics and\r\npsychotropic substances. The purpose of the meetings is to\r\naddress comprehensively the global menace of drug abuse\r\nand its consequences. India has been a victim not only of\r\ntraders, who have used it as a transit route for drugs from\r\nthe Golden Crescent and the Golden Triangle, but also of\r\nrecent virulent forms of the drug menace, such as\r\nnarco-terrorism. International cooperation in this area is\r\nimperative, as the problem is global and demands global\r\nsolutions.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on the implementation\r\nof the Global Plan of Action is a comprehensive guide for\r\naction by Member States. My delegation endorses the\r\nrecommendations therein - particularly those relating to licit\r\nproduction, the tackling of precursors, multilateral and\r\nregional arrangements and measures to deal with terrorist\r\nand insurgent groups.\r\nIndia is a party to all the international Conventions on\r\ndrug- abuse prevention. We are also a party to the South\r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\r\nConvention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\r\nof 1990 - a regional Convention on the subject, which came\r\ninto force in 1993. We cannot overemphasize the need to\r\ncheck the drug menace, as it undermines the very\r\nfoundations of organized society. While it may be easy to\r\ncriticize those who fall victim to drug abuse, it is even more\r\nimportant to deal with the people and organizations that\r\nmake it possible for drugs to be peddled across the globe to\r\nsatisfy their base instincts and their lust for profit. It is\r\nsignificant that evidence of the close nexus between\r\nnarcotics, gun-running and terrorism is surfacing. Unless\r\nthere is a determined effort on the part of countries,\r\nirrespective of political ideologies and differences, this\r\nmenace cannot be tackled effectively. I therefore give an\r\nassurance that India will spare no effort in extending to the\r\ninternational community full cooperation in all possible steps\r\nto enforce the United Nations Conventions.\r\nThe Government of India, in pursuance of the United\r\nNations General Assembly’s resolution S-17/2 of\r\n23 February l990 and the Global Programme of Action, has\r\nundertaken a series of measures to implement the relevant\r\nrecommendations. In order to eradicate the illicit production\r\nof narcotic drugs, a country-wide action plan has been\r\nformulated, and appropriate instructions have been issued to\r\nall law-enforcement agencies under the Federal and state\r\nGovernments. We are making vigorous efforts to identify\r\nand destroy drugs being illicitly cultivated.\r\nIn order to ensure total safety for the licit production of\r\nopium, a number of measures have been taken in the current\r\nyear to prevent leakage. The Government has increased the\r\naverage yield to be tendered by farmers. The cooperation of\r\nagriculture universities has been enlisted. They are to\r\nconduct scientific experiments, in fields selected at random,\r\nfor the purpose of estimating average yield with a view to\r\ndetermining the level up to which the Government should\r\ninsist that farmers must tender. It has also been decided that\r\nthe number of points for the transfer of opium after its\r\ncollection should be reduced.\r\nModern methods of storage and transport are being\r\nemployed for the purpose of eliminating leakage while\r\nopium is in the process of transit and transfer. Scientific\r\ninstruments are being designed and developed so that the\r\nmoisture content of opium may be determined, and its\r\nweight accurately measured, actually in the farmer’s field.\r\nIt is expected that these instruments will be commissioned\r\nduring the ensuing crop season. We have also decided to\r\nstrengthen the security measures that are taken during the\r\nextraction season in all opium-growing areas of the country,\r\nto prevent traffickers from exploiting innocent farmers. The\r\nNarcotics Control Bureau will be turned into a strike force\r\nto intercept drug traffickers within the country and those\r\ncoming from outside. We are also cooperating closely with\r\ncertain affected countries for the purpose of joint detection\r\nof the kingpins of drug trafficking.\r\nThe Government has also solicited the cooperation of\r\nindustry to prevent the misuse of precursor chemicals. The\r\nNarcotics Control Bureau has advised every producer\r\nindividually of the international responsibility to ensure that\r\nthese precursor chemicals are sold only to authorized\r\npersons. Similarly, the assistance of the chambers of\r\ncommerce and industry has been sought. They have been\r\nasked to give their members advice about ensuring the safety\r\nof chemicals and about their proper sale to authorized\r\npersons. My Government is taking steps to amend and make\r\nmore stringent the laws governing confiscation and forfeiture\r\nof property of people involved with narcotic drugs. We\r\nhope that the series of preventive measures that have been\r\ntaken recently by the Government and the close cooperation\r\nwe are maintaining with affected countries will result in an\r\neffective check on the spread of the narcotics menace.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nRecently, we have also been holding bilateral\r\ndiscussions with neighbouring countries, and I am happy to\r\ninform the Assembly that these meetings have produced an\r\nexcellent response by way of close cooperation in this area.\r\nWe have entered into bilateral agreements with several\r\ncountries, and negotiations with 10 others, with a view to\r\nconcluding such bilateral agreements, are in progress.\r\nIn the social sector, we have formulated a three-point\r\nstrategy comprising awareness-building, community-based\r\nrehabilitation and the training of functionaries. A quick\r\nsurvey in 33 Indian cities has revealed easy availability, an\r\nincreasing variety of drugs, increasing use of intravenous\r\nsyringes and the spread of HIV linked to the use of infected\r\nneedles. The number of registered addicts has risen at an\r\nalarming rate. While the regulatory and suppressive\r\nmeasures have shown increasing efficiency, more emphasis\r\nmust be placed on the question of demand reduction.\r\nWe have mounted a continuous multi-media barrage,\r\nand considerable awareness of the evil effects of drug\r\naddiction has been generated. We recognized from the start\r\nthat the success of drug-abuse prevention schemes depended\r\non community-based rehabilitation and the association of\r\nvoluntary organizations. We have 254 counselling,\r\nde-addiction and after-care centres, all run by\r\nnon-governmental organizations. Under our programme of\r\ntraining professionals, 4,400 doctors, paramedics, social\r\nworkers, police and prison officials have been given\r\norientation in drug-abuse and prevention programmes.\r\nWe have increased the allocations for these programmes\r\nfourfold during the last two years. Substantially higher\r\nallocations will be required for tackling the problem\r\nadequately in the future. UNDCP’s assistance has been\r\nuseful, and there is a need to increase the assistance to cover\r\nthe establishment of de-addiction and rehabilitation centres.\r\nI should like to pay a tribute to the efforts of UNDCP for\r\nrecommending bold and pragmatic measures to fight the\r\ndrug menace and for making recommendations for\r\nharmonizing national legislations in this regard.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to\r\nreaffirm my country’s strong determination to combat, with\r\nthe cooperation of the international community, this scourge\r\nof drug abuse and the menace of drug trafficking. We\r\nshould also like to express our appreciation to those who\r\nhave taken the initiative to negotiate a comprehensive draft\r\nresolution to be adopted at the conclusion of these high-level\r\nplenary meetings. I trust that the measures identified in the\r\ndraft resolution will facilitate effective international\r\ncooperation in dealing with drug abuse and related problems.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Mr. Aad Kosto, State\r\nSecretary, Ministry of Justice, of the Netherlands.\r\nMr. KOSTO (Netherlands): There is every reason for\r\nthe problem of drugs to be high on the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. Drug trafficking\r\nand drug use are undermining internal order in numerous\r\ncountries throughout the world, and international criminal\r\norganizations use methods which constitute a direct threat to\r\nliberty and the rule of law for the people of the States\r\nrepresented here. The Netherlands Government believes\r\ninternational cooperation is necessary to reduce both the\r\nsupply of and the demand for drugs and to destroy the\r\ncriminal networks which traffic in drugs. I should like to\r\ntake this opportunity to outline a number of new initiatives\r\ntaken by my Government in this area.\r\nI should also like, on behalf of the Government of the\r\nNetherlands, to express my great respect for the major\r\ncontribution to efforts to combat drug use and drug\r\ntrafficking made in recent years by the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), led by\r\nMr. Giacomelli, its Executive Director. May I also pay\r\ntribute to the role played in this work by the Commission on\r\nNarcotic Drugs as the relevant policy-making body.\r\nThe Conventions concluded within the framework of\r\nthe United Nations, together with the Global Programme of\r\nAction and the United Nations System-Wide Action Plan,\r\nform a comprehensive framework for drug-control activities\r\non the part of Member States and international organizations.\r\nIt therefore gives me great pleasure to be able to state that\r\nthe Netherlands recently acceded to the 1971 Convention on\r\nPsychotropic Substances and the 1988 Vienna Convention\r\nagainst Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\r\nSubstances. In other words, the Netherlands is now bound\r\nby all the relevant United Nations Conventions.\r\nI would also draw attention to the introduction by the\r\nUNDCP of master plans which form the basis for the\r\nimplementation of its projects and programmes. The\r\nessential element of such plans is a multidisciplinary\r\napproach, both to reducing trafficking and supply and\r\ndemand and to social and development problems at the\r\nregional and subregional level. This has led to significant\r\nimprovements in the way in which the drug problem is\r\ntackled in a wider context.\r\nOne example is the important role assigned by the\r\nDublin Group to the UNDCP in the Task Force on\r\ncoordination of drug control assistance to Eastern Europe,\r\nnot only in coordinating activities in the various countries of\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 19\r\nEastern Europe but also in formulating recommendations and\r\npriorities for the various regions.\r\nThe Netherlands is aware of the problems that drug\r\nabuse, illicit drug production and trafficking create for\r\ndeveloping countries. In some countries the drug issue even\r\nthreatens to impede normal and sustainable development.\r\nWe recognize that the drug problem forms part of a complex\r\nset of forces that may include social, economic and even\r\ncultural elements. We also believe that isolated efforts that\r\ndo not take all these elements into account are doomed to\r\nfail. The development of an integrated strategy is therefore\r\nneeded to eliminate illicit drug production, as well as\r\ntrafficking and demand.\r\nThe Netherlands has previously committed itself to\r\nUNDCP programmes in Pakistan, Colombia, Bolivia,\r\nSuriname and the Netherlands Antilles.\r\nDespite all these estimable initiatives, we in the\r\ninternational community must, of course, never lose our\r\ncritical attitude. We must continue to seek ways of\r\neliminating the weaknesses in the system. To this end, the\r\nNetherlands supports proposals, on the one hand, to request\r\nthe Economic and Social Council to examine the status of\r\ninternational cooperation within the United Nations system\r\nin order to recommend ways and means of improving such\r\ncooperation and, on the other, to ask the Commission on\r\nNarcotic Drugs, with the support of the UNDCP and in\r\ncollaboration with the International Narcotics Control Board,\r\nto monitor and evaluate action at the national and\r\ninternational level to implement international drug-control\r\ninstruments, with a view to identifying areas of satisfactory\r\nprogress and areas of weakness and to recommend\r\nappropriate adjustments to drug-control activities wherever\r\nrequired.\r\nThe central aim here is the evaluation of the\r\nimplementation of international conventions and the\r\nresolutions adopted in recent years. It is essential that the\r\nmaster plans drawn up by the UNDCP be included in this\r\nprocess so that it can be established whether the\r\nrecommendations made in the plans are being carried out at\r\nthe regional level.\r\nWe in the Netherlands, like those in other countries, are\r\nfully aware of the need for critical monitoring to determine\r\nwhether the objectives of drug policy are being achieved in\r\npractice and whether parts of the policy require amendment.\r\nThe Dutch Government established the principles of its drug-\r\nabuse policy in 1976. The reduction of demand for drugs is\r\na basic goal of that policy. Over the years, we have\r\nconstantly striven to integrate demand reduction into our\r\neducation, health and social-services systems.\r\nThe facilities provided are nationwide and are available\r\nto all drug addicts. The various services involved, such as\r\nthe police, the judiciary and the social services, work\r\ntogether within our integrated-policy approach in a manner\r\nwhich I would venture to describe as excellent. Plans to\r\nexpand the provision of treatment, particularly for problem\r\naddicts who cause trouble in our cities, are now being\r\nprepared. I need hardly point out the close connection\r\nbetween addiction and crime, given the fact that a large\r\nproportion of the prison population are drug addicts. The\r\nGovernment and Parliament of the Netherlands therefore\r\nbelieve that coercive policy within the judicial system should\r\nbe tightened.\r\nIn addition, however, international drug traffickers have\r\nbecome more professional over the past few years, and the\r\nNetherlands is among the countries that have devised\r\nappropriate responses to professional crime. A large-scale\r\nreorganization of the police force has taken place in the\r\ninterests of greater efficiency and improved cooperation\r\nbetween the various investigative services. One very\r\nimportant point I should like to mention is the recent\r\nenactment of legislation expanding the scope for\r\ninvestigating organized crime. The Acts of Parliament to\r\nwhich I refer cover the seizure of assets purchased with the\r\nproceeds of crime, the combating of money laundering, the\r\ninterception of telecommunications and the protection of\r\nwitnesses. They have increased our potential for striking at\r\nthe heart of organized drug crime. It is not enough to arrest\r\ncouriers and other minor figures: we must direct our efforts\r\nat the key figures of criminal organizations. The new\r\napproach by the Dutch police and judicial authorities has\r\nalready led to a number of successes.\r\nInvestigations reveal trails leading to other countries,\r\nand that is why international cooperation in this area is vital.\r\nScope for such cooperation should be increased by a number\r\nof recent conventions, chief among which - in addition to the\r\n1988 Vienna Convention - is the 1990 Strasbourg\r\nConvention on laundering, tracing, seizure and confiscation\r\nof the proceeds of crime. The Netherlands has not only\r\nratified those Conventions but has also incorporated them\r\ninto national legislation. It is now possible under Dutch law,\r\ntherefore, to use financial means to tackle organized crime\r\nand to seize all illegally obtained advantage on behalf of the\r\nState. A number of ongoing investigations have yielded\r\ntheir first results and have led to major drugs hauls and the\r\nseizure of large sums of money and quantities of goods.\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe Netherlands is lending its assistance to the drafting\r\nof similar legislation in the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba\r\nand has signed a treaty with the United States, which will\r\nenter into force throughout the Kingdom as a whole, aimed\r\nat improving cooperation between our countries, with\r\nprovision for the sharing of assets. The Netherlands and the\r\nUnited Kingdom recently signed a bilateral treaty which\r\nbuilds upon the European conventions in this field.\r\nCooperation in practical matters with our immediate\r\nneighbours in Belgium, Germany, France and Luxembourg\r\nis being stepped up to a significant degree.\r\nHowever, the Netherlands has not only set its sights on\r\ncombating the international drug trade. Our \"coffee-shop\r\npolicy\", as it is called, derived from the belief that it would\r\nbe the least of all evils if in-house dealers, who were\r\ntolerated and monitored, helped to ensure that users of small\r\nquantities of soft drugs never came into contact with such\r\nhard drugs as heroin and cocaine, which have much more\r\nserious effects on a person’s health. However, this original\r\nobjective has been obscured by the sharp increase in the\r\nnumber of such coffee shops. As more and more coffee\r\nshops have opened for business in certain cities, they have\r\nattracted more and more customers, mainly from abroad.\r\nThis has to be stopped. Once the number of coffee shops\r\nhas been reduced - and the Dutch judicial authorities are\r\nactively pursuing such a policy as I speak - the distortion of\r\nthe original objectives will come to an end, and with it the\r\ndrug tourism.\r\nThe Schengen Agreement affords excellent\r\nopportunities for us to join forces with neighbouring\r\ncountries in Europe to combat drug tourism. Indeed, joint\r\naction is the key to all efforts to stop drug trafficking.\r\nWithin the European Community, therefore, the Netherlands\r\nis a firm advocate of facilitating extradition procedures and\r\nthe exchange of information. EUROPOL, which is to be\r\nresponsible for pooling resources in Europe, is another\r\nindispensable element in efforts to tackle the international\r\ndrug trade.\r\nNevertheless, we in Europe must not forget the\r\nimportance of a multidisciplinary approach to the drug\r\nproblem. The important thing is to reduce demand as well\r\nas supply. The establishment of the European Drug\r\nMonitoring Centre could lay the basis for this process by\r\ndisseminating information on the treatment of drug addicts\r\nwithin Europe and hence improving their treatment.\r\nI should therefore like to conclude by stressing once\r\nagain that cooperation at the European Community level,\r\ntogether with the know-how possessed by the United Nations\r\ndrug-control agencies in Vienna, is essential if we are to\r\ntackle the drug problem. My Government is always\r\navailable for such cooperation.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call upon\r\nMr. Kyung-Shik Joo, Vice-Minister of Health and Social\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. JOO (Republic of Korea): I have the honour to\r\nmake a few remarks concerning international drug control,\r\non behalf of the Government of the Republic of Korea.\r\nNo one doubts that the unabating situation of drug\r\nabuse and illicit trafficking remains a major concern in\r\ntoday’s world. Despite the whole framework for\r\ninternational cooperation and a wide range of efforts by the\r\ninternational community, an increasing number of people are\r\nstill languishing under the yoke of drug abuse. Large\r\nquantities of chemicals have been illicitly diverted to the\r\nunlawful manufacture of drugs, and new forms of illicit\r\ndrugs have been developed. Trafficking methods are\r\nbecoming increasingly complicated and diverse.\r\nWhile the end of East-West confrontation has provided\r\na rare opportunity for prosperity, the accompanying political\r\nand economic upheavals in various parts of the world have\r\nalso provided new opportunities for illicit traffickers,\r\nenabling them to penetrate regional boundaries more easily.\r\nCriminal drug organizations can effectively expand their\r\nareas of operation, entering into collusion with other\r\ninternational criminal groups such as illegal arms dealers and\r\nterrorists. This certainly poses a formidable threat to the\r\nsecurity of the international community. The global situation\r\nof drug abuse remains grim. Drug-producing countries are\r\nstill producers. Consumer countries remain consumers.\r\nThere is a proliferation of the number of transit countries.\r\nMoreover, illegal drug-trafficking organizations have\r\nruthlessly contaminated transit areas.\r\nNo single formula based on supply and demand can\r\neffectively cure this pernicious disease. It is also obvious\r\nthat the threat of drug abuse and illicit trafficking cannot be\r\neffectively eliminated by the efforts of a single country.\r\nIllicit traffickers have demonstrated their ability to adapt to\r\nchanging circumstances. In this regard, the firm will and\r\ndetermination of Governments to do the job properly and\r\ncooperation between Governments at the regional and\r\ninternational level are required.\r\nOur frustration easily leads us to accept that widespread\r\ndrug abuse is an incurable disease, with an unbelievable\r\nability to transform itself constantly and immediately,\r\nmaking medicines or vaccines ineffective and useless against\r\nit. However, drug abuse is curable if we use the right\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 21\r\nmedicines or vaccines. For this reason, we are compelled to\r\nreview the strategies and policies that have been adopted to\r\nfight drug abuse.\r\nThe blueprint for drug abuse control was presented in\r\nthe forms of the Global Programme of Action, the\r\nComprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Future activities\r\nin Drug Abuse Control and the System-Wide Action Plan on\r\nDrug Abuse Control. They provide a very comprehensive\r\nframework for effective measures to control drug abuse.\r\nThe commitment of the international community to\r\neliminate drug abuse has also been clearly demonstrated by\r\nthe conclusion of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic\r\nDrugs, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances and\r\nthe 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in\r\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Many States\r\nhave become party to the international drug control treaties,\r\nand even non-party States have endeavoured to implement\r\nthe treaties’ terms.\r\nThe principle of shared responsibility is now widely\r\naccepted by the international community, as the scope of\r\ninternational cooperation expands to include various aspects\r\nof the drug problem. In particular, approaches such as the\r\nintroduction of a drug dimension into the lending and\r\nprogramming policy of international financial institutions and\r\ninto the financing of alternative development activities\r\nrightly reflect the perception of the international community\r\nthat the drug problem cannot be solved by narrowly focusing\r\non its socio-pathological aspect and that we need a\r\nmultidisciplinary approach duly taking into account social,\r\ncultural and economic factors in order to ensure a truly drug-\r\nfree world.\r\nWhat, then, have we missed? We may simply blame\r\nthe multilateral systems for the worsening situation. Or we\r\nmay use the excuse that international drug-control treaties\r\nhave become too rigid to reflect rapidly changing realities.\r\nStill, we cannot escape the fact that the victims of drug\r\nabuse are our own people - our own neighbours and our own\r\nchildren.\r\nWe believe that international cooperation has been\r\ncarried out very staunchly and systematically. What we\r\nneed most at this juncture is to shake off our chronic sense\r\nof helplessness. We should once again muster our wisdom\r\nand revitalize our commitment. We should demonstrate our\r\nwillingness to implement what we have agreed upon.\r\nThe situation in the Republic of Korea has greatly\r\nimproved following intensified interventions to reverse the\r\ngrowing trend towards drug abuse. My country has made\r\ngreat progress in eradicating the manufacture of\r\nmethamphetamine through a continued crackdown on the\r\nmanufacture of illicit drugs and through awareness\r\ncampaigns.\r\nIn early 1989 methamphetamine produced in Korea\r\naccounted for 70 per cent to 90 per cent of the volume of\r\nmethamphetamine smuggled into Japan. By the end of that\r\nyear the percentage had plunged to 12 per cent, and no\r\nsmuggling of methamphetamine from the Republic of Korea\r\nhas since been detected. The Global Programme of Action\r\nhas served as a model framework for my Government in\r\nwaging the war against drug abuse. The Government of the\r\nRepublic of Korea has adopted a comprehensive and\r\nmultidisciplinary approach. Policy tools have ranged from\r\na forceful clamp-down on the manufacture, supply and\r\ntrafficking of illicit drugs, through public-awareness\r\ncampaigns to reduce the demand for illicit drugs, to the\r\ntreatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts. As a result of\r\nthese multisectoral efforts, the number of those perpetrating\r\ndrug-related offences has substantially decreased.\r\nMy country, aware of the urgency of bilateral and\r\nmultilateral cooperation in the fight against drug abuse, has\r\nactively joined the efforts of the international community\r\naimed at combating drug abuse and illicit trafficking. For\r\ninstance, the Republic of Korea has collaborated with the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme\r\n(UNDCP)in the latter’s Goodwill Ambassadors initiative,\r\nwhich was formally launched as part of the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations Decade against Drug Abuse, in 1992, with\r\nthe appointment of the Chung Trio as the first anti-drug\r\nambassadors.\r\nIn the Republic of Korea, the Goodwill Ambassador\r\nevents received nationwide coverage by the media, thus\r\nsuccessfully disseminating the information that drug abuse\r\ncan threaten the future of mankind. In this context, my\r\ndelegation wishes to recall General Assembly resolution\r\n47/102, which called upon Governments to cooperate with\r\nUNDCP in expanding the Goodwill Ambassadors initiative\r\nto combat drug abuse.\r\nThe Republic of Korea, as a party to the Single\r\nConvention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention\r\non Psychotropic Substances of 1971, has stepped up its\r\nefforts to harmonize its national legislation with the 1988\r\nUnited Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic\r\nDrugs and Psychotropic Substances to make possible early\r\nadherence to the Convention.\r\nIn an effort to provisionally apply Article 12 of the\r\n1988 United Nations Convention, the Government of the\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nRepublic of Korea has prepared legislative measures to\r\nprevent 22 listed chemicals from being diverted into illicit\r\ndrug manufacturing, by requiring drug manufacturers and\r\ntraders to keep records of all transactions.\r\nIn addition, a draft statute concerning asset forfeiture\r\nand controlled delivery is being prepared. With respect to\r\nmoney laundering, the Government in August introduced\r\nnew legislation that requires all financial transactions to be\r\nconducted in the transactor’s real name. This legislation will\r\nmake money laundering virtually impossible.\r\nIn connection with international cooperation to combat\r\nillicit trafficking of drugs, the Republic of Korea hosted the\r\neighteenth meeting of the Heads of National Drug Law\r\nEnforcement Agencies in Asia and the Pacific region, from\r\n13 to 17 September this year, in Seoul. The discussions at\r\nthe meeting were very lively, and the exchange of views and\r\nexperiences among participants was extremely useful and\r\ninformative.\r\nWe should not tolerate the current grim situation with\r\nrespect to the abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic\r\nsubstances. If this worsening trend is not stopped now, the\r\nfuture of the human race will be in grave danger. I firmly\r\nbelieve that only a common response and a reaffirmed\r\ncommitment to act at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels can guarantee a drug-free world.\r\nT h e P R E S I D E N T : I n o w c a l l o n\r\nMr. Christo Koulishev, Deputy Minister of Finance of\r\nBulgaria.\r\nMr. KOULISHEV (Bulgaria) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): The dramatic increase in illicit activities related\r\nto narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, threatening\r\nthe well-being of the individual and of society as a whole,\r\nis becoming one of the most urgent international issues of\r\nglobal significance.\r\nThe magnitude of this rising trend requires a prompt\r\nand adequate response from the international community\r\nthrough the relevant United Nations bodies, which have\r\nalready proved to be efficient in combating drugs.\r\nThe decision taken by the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-seventh session to dedicate two days of high-level\r\nplenary meetings to an urgent examination of the status of\r\ninternational cooperation against drugs re-emphasized the\r\nconcern and responsibility of the United Nations in this\r\nregard. Recognizing the leading role of the United Nations\r\nin providing policy guidance in the fight against drugs, the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Bulgaria considers its own\r\nparticipation in international cooperation against the illicit\r\nproduction, sale, demand, traffic and distribution of narcotic\r\ndrugs and psychotropic substances a matter of priority for\r\ntwo reasons: firstly, the geographical position of Bulgaria at\r\nthe natural crossroads between Europe and the Middle East\r\nand the current economic difficulties facing the country in its\r\ntransition to a market economy, which heighten the risk of\r\nan increase in drug-related criminal activities within the\r\ncountry, worsening the situation not only inside but outside\r\nits borders; and secondly, our awareness that efficient and\r\ncomprehensive drug control is beyond the power of a single\r\nState and that adequate coordination at the regional and\r\ninternational levels is necessary.\r\nFully aware of the negative impact of this social\r\nscourge, Bulgaria was among the first countries to sign and\r\nratify the existing international legal instruments in the field\r\nof drugs. The 1988 United Nations Convention against\r\nIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\r\nentered into force for Bulgaria in December 1992. This\r\nyear, Bulgaria acceded to the Council of Europe Convention\r\non Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the\r\nProceeds from Crime. With the support of the Legal Affairs\r\nDivision of the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP), the Bulgarian authorities have\r\nembarked upon the process of bringing national legislation\r\ninto line with these Conventions.\r\nBulgaria attaches great importance to the improvement\r\nof the national capacity for facing drug-related problems,\r\nwhich it considers a prerequisite for successful international\r\ncooperation. In July 1993, the Government set up an\r\nInterministerial Committee as the administrative structure for\r\ncoordinating the activities of all State bodies involved in\r\ndrug prevention and control. The Committee will implement\r\nthe national strategy and master plan in combating drugs.\r\nIn 1991, the Bulgarian Government created a special\r\nbranch of the police service at the Ministry of the Interior\r\nfor combating organized crime. The branch has operational\r\nlinks with INTERPOL and other national agencies.\r\nTechnical assistance, including equipment and training,\r\nespecially for law enforcement agencies, is considered to be\r\nof paramount importance for the building of national\r\ncapacity and the strengthening of control on the borders and\r\nwithin the national territory. We hope that fruitful\r\ncooperation with the bilateral donors and UNDCP in this\r\nsphere will be further developed and will be of mutual\r\nbenefit. We welcome the creation of the United Nations\r\nSystem-Wide Action Plan on Drug Abuse Control and we\r\nhope it will contribute to the successful implementation of\r\nthe Global Programme of action.\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 23\r\nWe highly appreciate the positive role of the\r\nInternational Narcotics Control Board as an independent\r\norgan for observing the application of the international\r\nConventions on drugs. In June 1993, an expert mission\r\nfrom the Board visited Bulgaria and provided assistance in\r\nidentifying and eliminating some deficiencies in our drug-\r\ncombating policy and related operational activities. We hope\r\nthat cooperation with the Board will continue because it is\r\nof mutual interest.\r\nFor the time being, transit trafficking remains\r\nBulgaria’s major drug-related problem. As further evidence\r\nof this, the main seizures of narcotics made by the Bulgarian\r\nCustoms authorities have taken place at the borders of the\r\ncountry. Last year the authorities made 36 seizures of\r\nsmuggled narcotics, for a total amount of 246 kilograms; 28\r\nof those seizures were of heroin, amounting to a total of 159\r\nkilograms. From 1 January to 21 October of this year, the\r\nCustoms authorities have made 46 seizures of illicit\r\nnarcotics, amounting to a total of 460 kilograms, among\r\nwhich were 40 seizures of heroine with a total amount of\r\n457 kilograms.\r\nAccording to the statistics of the Zollkriminalamt in\r\nCologne, Germany, the Bulgarian Customs administration\r\noccupies first place in amounts of heroin seized along the\r\nBalkan route. Despite the fact that new diversionary\r\nbranches of the Balkan route are being created, according\r\nto the available United Nations data, about 70 per cent of the\r\nillicit trafficking in heroin to the target countries, mainly in\r\nWestern Europe, is being carried out through the classic\r\nBalkan route. Once again, this underscores the crucial\r\nimportance of control of the Bulgarian southern border.\r\nThe war in former Yugoslavia and the embargo\r\nimposed on that country have forced most of the\r\ntransportation vehicles to move in the direction of our\r\nnorthern border on the Danube river, where the first 13\r\nseizures of smuggled narcotics have been made. Along with\r\nthat development has come the initial process of establishing\r\na domestic illicit market for psychotropic substances.\r\nMoreover, heroine is expected gradually to replace the\r\ntraditionally used psychotropic substance on the market. The\r\nlast two years have seen individual cases of illegal\r\ncultivation of opium poppy and cannabis.\r\nDuring the first two quarters of this year, the specially\r\nestablished Central Office seized two illegal laboratories for\r\nthe production of amphetamines, located deep within the\r\ncountry. Seizures have been made of 11 kilograms of\r\namphetamines, 7 kilograms of phenitiline, 3.5 kilograms of\r\nphenobarbital, 3.1 kilograms of codeine, 154 litres of\r\nbenzyl-methyl-ceton, 9 kilograms of heroin and 4 kilograms\r\nof opium.\r\nThe Republic of Bulgaria attaches particular importance\r\nto the international cooperation in the field of the control of\r\nnarcotics and psychotropic substances. The participation of\r\nthe Bulgarian Customs authorities in international efforts to\r\nstop the trafficking in narcotics began in 1969. The Police\r\nand Customs authorities have signed or will be signing\r\nbilateral agreements for cooperation with many European\r\ncountries and the United States of America.\r\nIt is clear that illicit activities connected with narcotic\r\ndrugs and psychotropic substances are directly linked with\r\neconomic and social conditions in the counties affected by\r\nthem. The economic liberalization and privatization of the\r\npharmaceutical industry which are part of economies in\r\ntransition contribute to the development of negative trends in\r\nthe field of control, including the precursor control. The\r\ncontinuing traffic results in the dissemination of narcotic\r\ndrugs and psychotropic substances, which in turn means the\r\ncreation of national illicit markets and increases in illicit\r\ndemand, trade and distribution. Drug abuse could become\r\na significant medical and social problem which will\r\nadversely affect Bulgarian society. Taking into account the\r\nconsiderable drop in the gross domestic product during the\r\npast three years and the rise in unemployment resulting from\r\nthe readjustment of the national economy, the losses\r\nsustained by Bulgaria from strict implementation of United\r\nNations sanctions against former Yugoslavia and the heavy\r\nburden of the foreign debt, it is obvious that the State\r\npossesses limited funds and means for dealing with the\r\nsituation with respect to drugs.\r\nIn this regard the understanding and assistance of the\r\ninternational community and most donors in helping us face\r\nup to specific economic problems in countries with\r\neconomies in transition, especially those of them\r\neconomically affected by the application of the United\r\nNations sanctions against former Yugoslavia, should help\r\nthem to tackle with the drug-related problems in a more\r\nappropriate way.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 3208 (XXIX) of 11 October 1974, I\r\nnow call on the Commissioner of the European Community,\r\nMr. Padraig Flynn.\r\nMr. FLYNN (European Community): In his capacity\r\nas Chairman of the European Community’s Council of\r\nMinisters, my distinguished friend Minister Wathelet has\r\nindicated to the Assembly how seriously the European\r\nCommunity and its Member States regard the drug problem.\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nAs the Member of the European Commission responsible for\r\ndrugs policy, I have the honour and the privilege of\r\ndescribing to the Assembly the role and the activities of the\r\nEuropean Community in fighting this plague in our societies.\r\nNever before, in all of history, has there been such a\r\nseeping sense of helplessness, such a sense that any action\r\ncan be subverted, any process eroded, any campaign vitiated\r\nby the forces of evil. The European Community is well\r\naware of this, and more.\r\nThe European Community has long recognized the\r\nparticular responsibilities of industrialized countries and\r\nregions in this fight. The Community has also been\r\nincreasingly conscious of the extent to which the dynamics\r\nof European integration, the creation of a single market\r\nwithout internal frontiers and the decisive steps we are\r\ntaking towards European union present us with new\r\nchallenges. The initiatives taken at Community level\r\nindicate the seriousness with which the Community views\r\nthe drug problem and the growing recognition within the\r\nCommunity of the need to take action at that level.\r\nThe Community also knows that the European ideal of\r\npeace and prosperity requires substantial, real and\r\nmeasurable progress to be made in this fight. The more\r\nimportant of the actions to that end in recent years include:\r\nthe creation in l989 of the European Committee to Combat\r\nDrugs (CELAD), bringing together National Drug\r\nCoordinators from each member State and the Commission;\r\nthe subsequent adoption by the Council of Ministers of the\r\nEuropean Community meeting in Rome in 1990 of the first\r\nEuropean Plan to combat drugs, which provides a\r\ncomprehensive framework for measures in the field of\r\ndemand reduction, law enforcement and international\r\ncooperation and which was updated at the Edinburgh\r\nmeeting of the Council of Ministers of the European\r\nCommunity last December; the ratification by the\r\nCommunity - the only regional economic organization to\r\nhave done so - of the 1988 United Nations Convention\r\nagainst Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\r\nSubstances; the adoption at Community level of legislative\r\nmeasures governing trade in precursors both within the\r\nCommunity and with third countries; the adoption of a\r\nDirective on money laundering and a Regulation providing\r\nfor the establishment of a European Monitoring Centre for\r\nDrug Abuse as a result of Commission proposals; the\r\norganization of the first European Drug Prevention Week in\r\n1992, involving the widespread participation of both\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations\r\nthroughout the Community.\r\nThis is a world-wide problem. It is a threat that speaks\r\nall languages, a commerce that accepts all currency, a killer\r\nwhich makes no distinction of race, creed or nationality; and\r\nit can be fought only through cooperation, intensified\r\ncoordination and international solidarity. Recognizing this,\r\nwe have long believed that the United Nations provides a\r\nnecessary focal point in the global fight against all aspects\r\nof illicit drugs. We reaffirm the importance we attach to the\r\nrole of the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP) in providing coordination and\r\neffective leadership for all United Nations drug-control\r\nactivities, and we are glad to acknowledge its achievements.\r\nI am particularly pleased, therefore, to note that the excellent\r\nworking relationships which exist between the Commission\r\nand the UNDCP were strengthened earlier this year by the\r\nconclusion of a liaison agreement. When the European\r\nCommunity talks about solidarity and cooperation, we do not\r\nmean it in an empty or a passive way.\r\nWithin the framework of the Group of 7, the\r\nCommunity and its member States have played an important\r\npart in the establishment and subsequent work of the\r\nChemical Action Task Force. The Community also\r\nparticipates actively in the Financial Action Task Force.\r\nThe North-South cooperation programme of the\r\nEuropean Community is directed to supporting the efforts of\r\ndeveloping countries to reduce demand largely through\r\nprevention measures. Community support has been provided\r\nto Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru through alternative\r\ndevelopment projects and trade preferences. The\r\nCommission has also recently submitted proposals for a\r\nmajor programme to support alternative development\r\nprojects in areas of illicit cannabis cultivation in the\r\nNorthern Provinces of Morocco. Close interregional links in\r\nprecursor control are envisaged via an agreement currently\r\nbeing prepared between the European Community and the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations. Furthermore, in\r\norder to exploit fully the new provisions under the Lomé IV\r\nConvention to assist countries of the African, Caribbean and\r\nPacific Group in their fight against drugs, a general\r\nassessment is being undertaken to identify their concrete\r\nneeds.\r\nAt the European level, a new East-West emphasis is\r\nprogressively being added to our international drugs\r\ncooperation. Operational programmes are already being\r\nimplemented in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and the Czech Republic, and these programmes will\r\nshortly be extended to other countries in the region. More\r\ngenerally, the Commission will continue to put emphasis on\r\ndrugs cooperation in the Community’s external relations by\r\n38th meeting - Tuesday, 26 October l993 25\r\ncontinuing to identify it as a priority in its cooperation\r\nagreements with third countries.\r\nI have spoken about some of the initiatives which are\r\nbeing taken by the European Community. We are at a\r\ncrucial point in the rapidly developing history of Europe.\r\nOnly a few days now separate us from the important date of\r\n1 November, when the Treaty on European Union will enter\r\ninto force, marking a new stage in the process of European\r\nintegration. The Treaty identifies drugs as a priority issue\r\nand creates important new opportunities for action. The\r\nproblem of drug dependence is singled out in the new\r\nprovision which the Treaty makes for cooperation in the area\r\nof public health, and this will allow the Community to\r\nconsolidate and build on its work on drug prevention.\r\nCombating drug addiction and unlawful drug trafficking have\r\nalso been identified as priority issues for cooperation in the\r\nfields of justice and home affairs. Likewise, drugs have\r\nbeen identified by the European Heads of State and\r\nGovernment as a priority of the common foreign and\r\nsecurity policy of the European Union.\r\nThe range of possibilities which the Treaty now offers\r\nfor action will represent important new weapons for the\r\nCommunity in the fight against the scourge of drugs in the\r\ncoming years. The Commission intends to ensure that this\r\nnew legal basis for action at Community level should be\r\nexploited to the full in order to promote the highest possible\r\nlevel of coordination and cooperation within the Community\r\nand to enable the Community to address the global drug\r\nphenomenon in a comprehensive way. More must be done,\r\nand more will be done.\r\nAs a first step in that process, the Commission is\r\norganizing a European scientific and technical seminar on\r\nstrategies and policies to combat drugs, which will be held\r\nin early December this year. That seminar is intended to\r\nprovide an opportunity for a discussion of the broader policy\r\nissues involved and an exchange of views on how the\r\nCommunity response can be improved in the context of the\r\nnew possibilities provided by the Treaty on European Union.\r\nI envisage that the findings of the seminar will provide a\r\ngood basis on which to draw up an up-to-date,\r\ncomprehensive and balanced European strategy covering\r\ndemand, supply and trafficking - an objective to which I am\r\npersonally entirely committed.\r\nThat is where the United Nations plays such a vital\r\nrole, because this strategy will work only if it is integrated\r\ninto a wider coordinated global strategy. That is where the\r\nUnited Nations has its great role, and I have been very glad\r\nof the opportunity to participate in the proceedings of these\r\nhigh-level plenary meetings, which are making such an\r\nimportant contribution to furthering world-wide cooperation\r\nin the fight against drugs.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
