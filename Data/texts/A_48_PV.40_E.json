"1United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n40th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nWednesday, 27 October 1993\r\nat 3 p.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 112 (continued)\r\nINTERNATIONAL DRUG CONTROL\r\nHIGH-LEVEL PLENARY MEETINGS TO EXAMINE\r\nTHE STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\r\nAGAINST THE ILLICIT PRODUCTION, SALE,\r\nDEMAND, TRAFFIC AND DISTRIBUTION OF\r\nNARCOTICS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES:\r\nDRAFT RESOLUTION A/48/L.12\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The first speaker is Ms. Wilma\r\nZafra Turbay, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of Colombia,\r\non whom I now call.\r\nMs. ZAFRA TURBAY (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Colombia attaches the greatest importance to\r\nthese high-level plenary meetings on international drug\r\ncontrol, which are being held within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly. We are pleased to have\r\nactively promoted this event at precisely the time when\r\ninterest in the subject appeared to be declining.\r\nUndoubtedly, this is the proper platform for the\r\ngeneration of effective and decisive responses from the\r\ninternational community to the implacable challenge that the\r\nillicit traffic in narcotics and psychotropic substances\r\nrepresents.\r\nDrug trafficking has acquired new dimensions and ever\r\nmore sophisticated mechanisms, demanding a clear and\r\neffective response from all States in order that we may\r\ntogether eradicate its harmful effects on world society.\r\nColombia views with concern the indications of\r\nincreased illicit consumption and production of and\r\ntrafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances. We\r\nare also alarmed by the growing incidence of drug-related\r\ncrimes, such as narco-terrorism, arms and explosives\r\ntrafficking, the diversion of precursor chemicals and money\r\nlaundering.\r\nDespite the significant efforts of the international\r\ncommunity, we can say - calmly, but with concern - that\r\ndrugs are as great a problem as ever; the problem is made\r\nworse by the indolence of some and the inadequate\r\napplication of the strategies to which we have all committed\r\nourselves at the international level.\r\nMy country has made a special effort to strengthen its\r\njudicial system through institutional reform, including new\r\ninvestigative mechanisms and indictment procedures. Today\r\nwe have more robust institutions that facilitate the strict\r\napplication of justice within the framework of the State’s\r\nmodernization process.\r\nAt the international level, Colombia has participated\r\nactively in the strengthening of cooperation. We have made\r\navailable to the international community such areas and\r\nmeans as we can, as well as the best of our human, financial\r\nand technical resources, in order to achieve a greater\r\nexchange of information and experience. In this context, I\r\nam pleased to give the Assembly confirmation of the\r\nColombian Congress’s approval in August of the United\r\nNations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs\r\nand Psychotropic Substances, adopted in Vienna in 1988.\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86988 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.40\r\n17 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe scope of drug-related phenomena is so vast that\r\ninternational instruments alone are not enough to overcome\r\nthis scourge. Each State must adopt and implement them\r\ninternally, showing genuine commitment. The outcome of\r\nthis struggle will remain in doubt as long as there is\r\ntolerance for such things as the free trade in and diversion\r\nof chemical precursors; the existence of tax and financial\r\nhavens for laundering illegal profits; and arms and\r\nexplosives trafficking linked to drugs.\r\nIn order to dismantle the financial apparatus of the\r\ncriminal organizations involved, international action must be\r\ngeared towards enabling financial systems and enforcement\r\nagencies swiftly to exchange information on suspicious\r\ntransactions.\r\nAlthough only a small amount of illicit capital enters\r\nthe Colombian economy, measures have been implemented\r\nto detect money laundering. Thanks to the joint initiative of\r\nthe private sector and the State security and investigative\r\nbodies, the detection of money laundering has been made\r\neasier, both inside and outside the country, in collaboration\r\nwith other Governments.\r\nThere is a clear link between illicit trafficking in arms\r\nand explosives and the violence associated with drug\r\ntrafficking. The failure to control the sale and export of\r\narms in some countries, in addition to the enormous\r\nresources of the criminal organizations, has made this one of\r\nthe most profitable businesses.\r\nThe environmental degradation caused by illegal\r\ncultivation, through the indiscriminate destruction of forests,\r\ncontinues to cause irreparable damage to the Andean and\r\ntropical ecosystems. Furthermore, the erosion caused by this\r\ncultivation has a drastic effect on water resources, a subject\r\nof vital importance on the international agenda.\r\nI must also mention the grave problem of the use and\r\nconsumption of narcotics and psychotropic substances. My\r\ncountry views with particular concern the sustained rise in\r\ndemand throughout the world. The international community\r\nmust promote an overall evaluation of demand-control and\r\ndemand-prevention policies in order to develop renewed\r\nstrategies. Active cooperation between States,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and private sector groups is\r\nindispensable for achieving the objectives of preventing drug\r\naddiction and treating and rehabilitating addicts.\r\nWe must reinforce the legal and financial mechanisms\r\nso that international cooperation will be more efficient in its\r\nvarious spheres of action. These include cooperation\r\nbetween judiciaries to exchange information and evidence to\r\nexpedite the indictment and trial of drug-traffickers; the\r\nharmonization of legislation so that there will be efficient\r\naction in matters of control and prevention and a real\r\ndecrease in criminality; and technical cooperation to make\r\npossible the dissemination and standardization of strategies\r\nand mechanisms aimed at preventing and curbing such\r\nactivities.\r\nI suggest to the Assembly that the United Nations\r\nCommission on Narcotic Drugs should meet at the highest\r\nlevel to make the necessary evaluations; adopt\r\nrecommendations and specific measures; and design new\r\nstrategies to bring greater efficiency to the attainment of the\r\nproposed goals and encourage States to show the firmest,\r\nclearest political will to implement the proposed actions.\r\nColombia is pleased to announce that in order to\r\npromote research in this field and put at the service of\r\ncountries affected by this curse the experience Colombia has\r\nacquired over recent years, the creation of a Centre for\r\nInternational Studies and Research on Drug Trafficking,\r\nwhere we hope, with other interested countries, to enhance\r\nknowledge and improve strategies for combating this sinister\r\nscourge of humanity.\r\nI should like to take advantage of this important\r\noccasion to express the Colombian Government’s recognition\r\nof the work being done by the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme (UNDCP), which is the\r\ncoordinating body for international cooperation within the\r\nUnited Nations system. However, we also want to\r\nemphasize the importance of endowing that Programme with\r\nthe resources necessary to ensure its timely and effective\r\noperation. The current level of its budget allows only for\r\nthe carrying out of pilot programmes in certain areas and\r\ncountries, whereas the problem calls for universal attention.\r\nOnce again, in this battle in which we are all engaged\r\nwe exhort all Governments to express their political will,\r\nrealistically and with tangible commitment. What is at stake\r\nis the well-being and survival of mankind. We must devote\r\nourselves with determination to building a society founded\r\non the human being as a rational, creative and feeling entity\r\nwho seeks to approach the new millennium in peace and\r\nharmony.\r\nOur hopes and the future of our children depend on the\r\nresponsibility with which we act in the present.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call upon the representative\r\nof Myanmar.\r\nMr. MIN (Myanmar): I should like to begin by\r\nexpressing the satisfaction of the delegation of Myanmar at\r\nseeing you, Sir, preside over the high-level plenary meetings\r\nof the General Assembly on drug-abuse control. In your\r\nopening address to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 3\r\nsession you rightly emphasized the need for a collective\r\nvision to turn individual dreams into reality. In no other\r\nhuman endeavour is there a more compelling need for such\r\nvision than in our efforts to rid the world of the scourge of\r\nillicit drugs.\r\nIn the past two decades the use of illicit drugs has\r\nspread at an alarming rate, affecting the individual, the\r\nfamily, the community and society in nations around the\r\nglobe. The illicit production, distribution and consumption\r\nof drugs have become a most serious problem, one that\r\nrepresents a global challenge requiring a global response. It\r\nis therefore encouraging to note that there is today a growing\r\nawareness in the international community of the need to take\r\na firm stand to overcome the threat posed to mankind by the\r\ndrug problem. The holding of these high-level plenary\r\nmeetings is a manifestation of that awareness and the\r\nleadership role that the United Nations plays in the field of\r\ndrug-abuse control. My delegation is confident that these\r\nmeetings will give us an opportunity to evaluate the\r\nimplementation of the Global Programme of Action adopted\r\nby the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session\r\nin 1990 as well as to enhance international cooperation.\r\nMyanmar believes that concerted action will be required\r\nat the international and national levels to meet the challenge\r\nposed by illicit drugs. In this regard, Myanmar has been\r\nshouldering its responsibilities both at home and abroad. In\r\nparallel with the anti-narcotics campaigns being carried out\r\nwithin the country, we have also been participating actively\r\nin international forums dealing with illicit drugs, from the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to narcotic\r\ndrugs to the World Ministerial Summit to Reduce Demand\r\nfor Drugs and to Combat the Cocaine Threat. As earnest of\r\nour commitment, we acceded to the 1988 Convention against\r\nIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\r\nin June 1991. Subsequently, in January 1993, the Myanmar\r\nGovernment enacted the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\r\nSubstances Law, which harmonizes its statutes with the\r\nmajor international treaties to which it is a party. It also\r\neliminates loopholes in earlier statutes with respect to\r\ncorruption, asset seizure and conspiracy.\r\nIn keeping with the 1990 Global Programme of Action,\r\nMyanmar has been cooperating with the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and\r\nneighbouring countries to expand activities aimed at reducing\r\nthe supply of illicit drugs and eventually eliminating opium\r\ncultivation in the country completely. In June 1992 the\r\nMyanmar Government took the initiative of signing\r\nagreements with the People’s Republic of China and the\r\nUNDCP, as well as with Thailand and the UNDCP, in order\r\nto collaborate in addressing the problems of illicit\r\nproduction, trafficking and abuse. The Governments of\r\nMyanmar and Laos have also agreed to cooperate in this\r\nregard. As delegations are aware, the Governments of\r\nMyanmar, China, Laos and Thailand yesterday signed here\r\nin New York a Memorandum of Understanding with the\r\nUNDCP. Myanmar also signed a drug-control agreement\r\nwith India in April of this year and aims to work out a\r\nsimilar agreement with Bangladesh.\r\nWe are confident that those cooperative efforts at the\r\nsubregional level will result, not only in the effective\r\nelimination of opium cultivation and trafficking in narcotic\r\ndrugs and chemicals used in the refining of heroin and the\r\nproduction of other illicit drugs, but also in reducing the\r\ndemand for local consumption and concurrently addressing\r\nthe problem of HIV-AIDS infection associated with\r\nintravenous drug abuse.\r\nMyanmar has been unrelenting in its war against the\r\nillicit production, trafficking and consumption of drugs since\r\nit regained its independence in 1948. In recent years efforts\r\nhave been stepped up, and my Government has been\r\nimplementing a nation-wide drug-suppression programme.\r\nWe realize that the illicit-drug problem is complex and that\r\nit must be addressed comprehensively. Accordingly, our\r\nnational programme is multifaceted and covers the whole\r\ngamut of drug-control activities, from law enforcement and\r\neducation to crop substitution and medical treatment.\r\nIn the past it has been our strategy to focus mainly on\r\nthe destruction of poppy fields, sometimes carried out\r\nmanually and at other times by aerial spraying of herbicides.\r\nWhile such efforts have had some success in addressing\r\nproduction and trafficking problems, the practice of shifting\r\ncultivation and drug production along and across border\r\nareas, coupled with the rough terrain and mountainous\r\ntopography, makes effective control difficult, with the result\r\nthat the overall impact of these measures has been limited.\r\nThe situation has been aggravated by the presence of heavily\r\narmed drug-trafficking groups in the drug-producing border\r\nareas.\r\nWith the advent of the State Law and Order Restoration\r\nCouncil, a new approach was adopted. Recognizing that the\r\ndrug problem cannot be divorced from the problem of\r\npoverty, my Government launched, in 1989, a new\r\nprogramme to raise the living standards of the national races\r\nin the border regions in order to narrow the gap between the\r\ncity dweller and the rural folk. The new approach is aimed\r\nat winning the hearts and minds of the local populace by\r\nraising their awareness of the insidious effects of drug abuse\r\nand the human misery and suffering that opium and other\r\nillicit drugs leave in their wake. The cornerstone of the new\r\napproach is the provision of alternative sources of income to\r\nthe farmers who depend entirely on the cultivation of the\r\nopium poppy for their livelihood. Accordingly, emphasis is\r\nnow being placed on programmes designed to generate\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nalternative incomes, such as crop substitution, livestock\r\nbreeding, trade promotion and mineral exploration.\r\nIn parallel with its anti-narcotic-drug programmes, the\r\nGovernment has been implementing since March 1989, on\r\na priority basis, a programme for the development of border\r\nareas and national races. A separate Ministry was\r\nestablished in 1992 to ensure the development of the border\r\nareas and to eradicate poppy cultivation.\r\nThe new approach of the Myanmar Government is in\r\nkeeping with the strategy recommended by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report on the implementation by Member\r\nStates of the Global Programme of Action. It provides for,\r\namong other things, the stimulation of rural development in\r\nopium-producing areas as another key element of the opium-\r\nelimination strategy. As stated in the report, one common\r\nfeature of the producing areas is that they are relatively\r\nremote, mountainous and not well integrated into the\r\nmainstream of national economic and social development.\r\nThe aim of the rural development programmes is to reduce\r\nthe isolation of such communities in those areas by\r\nimproving the transport and communication infrastructure\r\nand social services, as well as by introducing alternative\r\ncrops for their livelihood. The Myanmar Government has\r\nbeen implementing just such a programme, with the\r\nobjective of improving the transport and communication\r\ninfrastructure in the Shan, Kachin, Rakhine, Chin and Kayah\r\nstates and in the Sagaing division, which are the constituent\r\nunits of the Union of Myanmar bordering on neighbouring\r\ncountries.\r\nThe two parallel programmes of my Government - one\r\non narcotic drugs and the other on development -\r\ncomplement each other. Significant results have been\r\nachieved. As a result of the constructive measures taken by\r\nthe authorities, and reflecting their complete trust and\r\nconfidence in the policy of national reconciliation espoused\r\nby the State Law and Order Restoration Council and in its\r\ngoodwill and sincerity, 10 armed groups have now returned\r\nto the legal fold. They are now cooperating with the\r\nGovernment in promoting peace and prosperity in their\r\nrespective regions.\r\nRepresentatives of the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme (UNDCP) and other visitors to\r\nMyanmar have been given the opportunity to acquire\r\nfirsthand knowledge of the illicit-drug problem in the\r\ncountry. United States Congressman Charles B. Rangel,\r\nChairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics\r\nAbuse and Control, and a number of his colleagues from\r\nboth the United States Senate and House who visited\r\nMyanmar in the course of the current year saw for\r\nthemselves recent Myanmar Government achievements in the\r\nfield of narcotics control. I have already mentioned some of\r\nthose achievements, but, given their significance, allow me\r\nto repeat them.\r\nMyanmar signed drug-control agreements with China\r\nand UNDCP, and also with Thailand and UNDCP, in 1992.\r\nIn April 1993, Myanmar signed a drug-control agreement\r\nwith India and has already agreed to sign one with Laos.\r\nYesterday, here in New York, a Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding was signed between the Governments of\r\nMyanmar, China, Laos and Thailand and UNDCP. The\r\nmain objectives of the agreement are to eliminate opium-\r\npoppy cultivation through economic-and-social-\r\ndevelopment programmes, eliminate trafficking in narcotic\r\ndrugs and chemicals used in refining heroin, and reduce the\r\ndemand for and local consumption of narcotic drugs.\r\nIn cooperation with international partners, the Myanmar\r\nGovernment arrested 12 alleged traffickers earlier this year\r\non a conspiracy charge under its new statute. The\r\nGovernment enacted a new drug law in January 1993 to\r\nharmonize its statutes with the major international treaties to\r\nwhich it is a party. Drug task forces in the country have\r\nbeen increased from 5 in 1988 to 16 in 1992. Additional\r\ntask forces will be formed as required. Statistics for 1992\r\nshow that seizures of heroin by the authorities rose by nearly\r\n50 per cent while opium seizures rose by more than 35 per\r\ncent over the previous year’s totals. Seizures of heroin are\r\nnearly the same as those reported from Thailand,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the United States has placed\r\nMyanmar on the list of countries decertified as a\r\nnon-cooperating country in the fight against narcotics\r\ntrafficking.\r\nThe Myanmar Government and the United States Drug\r\nEnforcement Administration (DEA) have carried out an\r\nopium-yield study based on samples taken from\r\nrepresentative areas of the country. This is the first study of\r\nits kind in the country. Regarding cooperation between the\r\nMyanmar authorities and the United States DEA, I should\r\nhere like to quote the following passage from the report of\r\nthe head of the DEA Country Office in Yangon:\r\n\"During the entire period of DEA presence in\r\nMyanmar, there is not a single instance in which a\r\ncooperative DEA/Government of Myanmar\r\ninvestigation has been compromised. There are very\r\nfew countries in which DEA agents are assigned that\r\ncan make such a claim\".\r\nThe Myanmar authorities have responded fully to DEA\r\nrequests for investigative assistance. In this regard, the same\r\nofficial states:\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 5\r\n\"In some instances, the Government of Myanmar\r\nprovided more information than was actually requested\r\nin the first place\".\r\nThe endeavours of the Government of Myanmar to\r\ndevelop border areas are registering significant progress.\r\nOne manifestation of such progress is the return to the legal\r\nfold this month of the Kachin Independence Organization,\r\none of the largest armed groups in the country.\r\nSignificantly, representatives of the Kachin nationals stated\r\nat a press conference held at United Nations Headquarters on\r\n14 October that they are resolved to end poppy cultivation\r\nin their state by 1995.\r\nFrom what I have stated, it should be quite evident that\r\nthe Myanmar Government has taken serious measures to\r\naddress the problem of drug abuse and illicit trafficking. A\r\nhead start has been made. However, we are aware that only\r\nthrough concerted international efforts can the world\r\novercome the challenge posed by illicit drugs. The untold\r\nsuffering and misery that drug addiction wreaks upon our\r\nsocieties and nations demand that we work together to put\r\nan end to drug abuse and illicit trafficking.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Venezuela\r\nMr. TAYLHARDAT (Venezuela) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP) represents the concerted efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations and its Member States to combat the\r\nproduction, sale, demand for, traffic in and illicit distribution\r\nof drugs and psychotropic substances.\r\nIt will be possible to appreciate the full scope and value\r\nof the global strategy of international action, which is given\r\nconcrete form in the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme, only with the passing of time and to the\r\nextent that all States incorporate in their legislation and\r\ninternal policies the general guidelines laid down in the\r\ninstruments adopted in recent years. I refer in particular to\r\nthe Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Future\r\nActivities of 1987 and to the Global Programme of Action\r\nof 1990. Unquestionably, the full implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic\r\nDrugs and Psychotropic Substances, which was initiated by\r\nmy country, is a central element of this action.\r\nVenezuela approves of the important work being done\r\nby the United Nations, and particularly by the Executive\r\nDirector of the UNDCP, Mr. Giorgio Giacomelli, in the fight\r\nagainst drugs.\r\nIt is a fact that the harmful effects generated and\r\npropagated by the consumption of and illicit trafficking in\r\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related\r\nactivities have heightened social and economic problems and\r\nincreased violence within many of our countries.\r\nOur awareness of the fact that, far from improving, this\r\nsituation is growing more serious requires us to continue\r\nexamining its causes and its effects on the socio-economic\r\norder of our peoples so that we may take the most\r\nappropriate corrective measures.\r\nThe geographical situation of Venezuela - its\r\nadvantageous position on the sea, extensive border areas and\r\nmeans of communication - continually exposes it to the risk\r\nof being used by drug trafficking organizations as a transit\r\ncountry.\r\nTransit operations are not confined to the use of our\r\nterritory as a connecting point in international drug traffic.\r\nBecause of the capacity of drug traffickers for offence,\r\ntransit operations also undermine border security, the\r\nintegrity of foreign trade, the stability of the financial\r\nsystem, the civic and moral integrity of our officials and\r\ncitizens and our public health, as well as national\r\nsovereignty in its fullest context.\r\nThe so-called transit countries are not only used for the\r\ntransport of illegal drugs; they are also used in the transport\r\nof the chemicals employed in the clandestine manufacture of\r\ndrugs and in the transfer of the capital generated by such\r\nactivities, which, once it is rendered legitimate, is returned\r\nto the State where the criminal organization is based.\r\nIn spite of the dangerous implications of this, the\r\nspecial situation of transit countries has been an aspect of\r\nthe general problem of drug trafficking that is rarely\r\nconsidered by the international community. To ensure a\r\nmore effective worldwide struggle against drug trafficking,\r\nwe must analyse and examine in depth the situation of these\r\ncountries and the turmoil they experience as a result of the\r\nnegative impact of the drug problem on their social and\r\neconomic structures.\r\nFor these reasons, Venezuela believes that the problems\r\nof transit countries must be viewed in a broader context.\r\nWe are pleased that the draft resolution we will be adopting\r\nat the end of this debate takes this concern into account.\r\nVenezuela’s awareness of its position has prompted us\r\nto extend our efforts at prevention, control, supervision,\r\ninvestigation and full international cooperation to the\r\nmultiple phases of international drug traffic in transit, and to\r\nassociate the problem with security and national defence.\r\nInternal drug trafficking operations cannot be\r\nconsidered entirely independently of the situation generated\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nby transit traffic. The largest drug seizures continue to be\r\nmade from operations on international drug routes. This\r\ndoes not allow us to draw any conclusions about the internal\r\nsituation, particularly not if we take into account that the\r\nvarious operations taking part in the transit process do not\r\nalways correspond to the levels of criminal organization\r\nbased within the territory. These operations may be dictated\r\nby attempts to avoid repressive activities in a given region.\r\nAs a result of intensified vigilance along our borders,\r\ninvestigations of certain commercial activities in\r\nneighbouring States and of the transit of persons, among\r\nother actions carried out by the police, have made it possible\r\nto intercept certain international connections which sought to\r\nuse our territory to transfer illegal capital outside of the\r\ncountry.\r\nThis investigation, which is being carried out now and\r\nis still at a confidential stage, is an important precedent for\r\nthe establishment of the crime which doctrine and the new\r\nVenezuelan law identify as the legitimation of capital, and\r\nfor the definition of a more precise outline of illegal drug\r\ntransit operations.\r\nOn the basis of our past experience, we believe it\r\nimportant that, within the activities of prevention and\r\ncommunity mobilization, a place be made for the\r\nre-education of drug users who are being rehabilitated, with\r\na view to increasing their job skills as an effective means of\r\nreducing the demand for illicit drugs.\r\nThe attraction of trafficking in narcotic drugs and\r\npsychotropic substances lies in the possibility of obtaining\r\nlarge profits in a short amount of time. The two columns on\r\nwhich this business is founded are supply and demand,\r\nwhich are so closely related that it is almost impossible to\r\nconsider the problem and its consequences without taking the\r\nimportance of both into account.\r\nIn recent years, national and international actions have\r\nfocused primarily on combating supply. This has, to some\r\nextent, diverted attention away from effective policies for\r\nputting an end to illicit demand. In numerous international\r\nmeetings and forums, the growth of that essential element of\r\nthe problem has been noted, as well as the preference of\r\ntraffickers for importing and distributing drugs in those\r\nplaces where their market value is highest.\r\nThis disturbing picture reminds us of the need to\r\npromote large-scale strategies to prevent the clandestine\r\nmovement of drugs in those States where there is a great\r\ndemand for illegal drugs. A shrinkage of the market would\r\nbe effective, since without profitable places to sell the\r\nproduct there would be no incentive to produce and cultivate\r\nit. At the same time, this would alleviate the situation of the\r\ntransit countries.\r\nThis key aspect of the problem demands that we take\r\ninto account paragraph 4 of article 14 of the 1988 United\r\nNations Convention against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic\r\nDrugs and Psychotropic Substances (the Vienna Convention)\r\nand give priority to those programmes aimed at eliminating\r\nor reducing illicit demand.\r\nTo prevent the diversion towards unlawful uses of\r\nchemicals and precursors legally used by industry, Venezuela\r\nhas, since 1985, been implementing an administrative regime\r\nof supervision and control of the commercial operations\r\nwhich import and export these products.\r\nThe recent reform of the special drug law of 1984 was\r\napproved by the Venezuelan legislature to improve and\r\nexpand the earlier regime, adapting it to the stipulations of\r\nthe 1988 Vienna Convention and to the guidelines contained\r\nin the model law drawn up by the Inter-American Drug\r\nAbuse Control Commission and approved by the\r\nOrganization of American States. In accordance with this\r\nlegislative reform, import and export operations must be\r\nregistered and must obtain a special permit. The procedure\r\nby which these authorizations are granted is subject to the\r\nguidelines set out in the Vienna Convention.\r\nTo ensure the effectiveness of the import control\r\nestablished by the country, exporters must, in turn, exercise\r\ngreater vigilance and supervision over their exports and must\r\nalso speed up the system of exchange of information on\r\ncommercial operations involving these products.\r\nIn general, we would consider the expansion of the\r\nvoluntary system of estimating quantities required for\r\nindustrial use - similar to the system established for narcotic\r\ndrugs and psychotropic substances - a significant stride\r\nforward in drug-abuse control.\r\nThe drug problem should not be considered solely from\r\nthe individual points of view of producer, transit, consumer\r\nor money-laundering countries nor yet exclusively in a\r\nglobal or universal way. A regional orientation is also\r\nrequired, which would take advantage of the capacity for\r\ncooperation among the countries of a given region affected\r\nby this scourge and of the potential for coordination in\r\ndefining joint policies and actions.\r\nOne step in this direction could be, for example, for the\r\ncountries of the American continent and the Caribbean to\r\nagree on the objective of converting the region into a drug-\r\nfree zone by the first decade of the next century. We realize\r\nthat this is an ambitious objective, but if all those\r\nconcerned - producer, consumer, transit and money-\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 7\r\nlaundering countries - were to define a joint plan, even if we\r\nhad not achieved the objective by the date mentioned, at\r\nleast we would have made considerable progress by\r\ndeveloping a concerted and coordinated programme to\r\ncombat the problem of drugs in all its dimensions. Similar\r\ninitiatives in other regions of the world would also be\r\nbeneficial.\r\nMy country is firmly convinced of the essential role of\r\ninternational cooperation in the fight against the drug\r\nproblem. Venezuela resolutely supports all initiatives and\r\nactions the international community has undertaken along\r\nthese lines.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Before calling on the next speaker\r\nin the debate, I should like to inform the Assembly that, in\r\nview of the large number of Member States whose names\r\nare still inscribed on the list of speakers, the plenary meeting\r\nthis afternoon will go beyond 6 p.m., until at least 7.30 p.m.,\r\nas an extraordinary measure and thanks to additional\r\nconference services made available to these high-level\r\nmeetings. Once again I appeal to delegations to try to stick\r\nto the limits prescribed.\r\nThe General Assembly will continue and conclude the\r\ndebate on this item tomorrow afternoon.\r\nI now call on Mr. Zainuddin Abdul Bahari, Director of\r\nthe Anti-Drug Task Force of Malaysia.\r\nMr. BAHARI (Malaysia): Our meetings here mark yet\r\nagain the international community’s common resolve to\r\naddress collectively the scourge of drug abuse and illicit\r\ntrafficking. This series of meetings is significant and timely\r\nas the war against this scourge is far from over.\r\nAccording to reports from the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme (UNDCP), the Commission on\r\nNarcotic Drugs (CND) and the International Narcotic\r\nControl Board (INCB), the situation remains grim and we\r\nare fighting losing battles in certain regions. Our meetings\r\ntherefore provide the opportunity to take stock of these\r\ndevelopments and to dedicate ourselves to the onerous tasks\r\nahead of all of us. To achieve decisive results, efforts to\r\ncombat drug abuse and illicit trafficking require a\r\ncomprehensive, continuous, balanced and multidisciplinary\r\napproach.\r\nMy delegation shares the belief that the status of\r\ninternational cooperation to combat drug abuse and illicit\r\ntrafficking needs to be re-evaluated. The profusion of\r\nmultilayered, interrelated issues and participants has made\r\nthe fight against drug abuse and illicit trafficking an\r\nextremely difficult and complex undertaking. We need to\r\nbetter coordinate our work in order not to lose sight of our\r\nobjectives, priorities and strategies while maintaining our\r\ncohesiveness in fighting this menace. In this regard, the\r\nUnited Nations System-Wide Action Plan on Drug Abuse\r\nControl and the Global Programme of Action should be\r\ncontinuously reviewed and updated.\r\nIt is imperative that the United Nations take the lead\r\nrole in rationalizing the work to avoid duplication and\r\nensuring coordination and complementarity. The report of\r\nthe Secretary- General on \"Implementation of the United\r\nNations System-Wide Action Plan on Drug Abuse Control\"\r\n(A/48/329) mentions only a few agencies such as the World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO), the International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO), the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO). Obviously other\r\nagencies need to take an active part in this fight.\r\nUNDCP was formed to fulfil the need to address the\r\ndrug menace collectively, with the United Nations playing a\r\ncentral role of coordination. In playing that role, the United\r\nNations must make its activities consistent with and\r\ncomplementary to the efforts and commitments of national\r\nGovernments. The UNDCP should endeavour to cooperate\r\nwith, and optimize the activities and actions of, States rather\r\nthan doing the job for them. The UNDCP should also take\r\nits guidance from the CND, the main policy-making body.\r\nThe CND itself, which has been expanded, should now be\r\nmore active and effective.\r\nThe development of national master plans to implement\r\nthe Global Programme of Action is a good starting point for\r\ninternational cooperation in this area. To be effective, the\r\nProgramme should be implemented in tandem with national\r\npolicies and strategies. Malaysia commends the UNDCP for\r\nits initiatives at regional and subregional levels to assist\r\nnations in the implementation of the Programme, particularly\r\nin the development of national master plans. Malaysia\r\ndeveloped a sectoral master plan for anti-narcotics measures\r\nas early as 1985, and we reiterate our readiness to render the\r\nnecessary assistance to the UNDCP in formulating strategies\r\nin developing such master plans.\r\nIn conjunction with international and national strategies,\r\nsocieties must be sufficiently well informed and sensitized\r\nso that they can respond positively to these initiatives.\r\nMalaysia supports the thrust of the approach envisaged by\r\nthe Global Programme of Action for an international strategy\r\nencompassing the reduction of illicit supply of narcotic drugs\r\nand psychotropic substances; the curb on demand through\r\nprevention of drug addiction and treatment; rehabilitation and\r\nsocial reintegration of addicts; the suppression of illicit\r\nmanufacture of and trafficking in drugs; and the regulation\r\nof the international market in drugs for medical and\r\nscientific purposes.\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nPrevention is a key element in the fight against drug\r\nabuse. The Secretary-General’s report mentions two\r\nimportant principles relating to demand reduction. The first\r\nprinciple involves the question of a demand-reduction\r\nprogramme which requires the involvement of all sectors of\r\nsociety and the international community. The second\r\nprinciple focuses on specific vulnerable target groups.\r\nSufficient and relevant legislation must be enacted and\r\nadequate resources must be allocated as prerequisites to any\r\nsustainable implementation of demand-reduction\r\nprogrammes.\r\nMalaysia’s own experience confirms that drug-demand\r\nreduction measures have an important role in the war against\r\nthe scourge of drugs abuse and illicit trafficking. We are\r\nalso convinced that for these measures to be effective the\r\ncommitment of national Governments is required. The\r\nprovision of legislation for the screening of suspected drug\r\naddicts enables us to estimate the magnitude of the drug-\r\nabuse problem. This provides a sound basis for the\r\nformulation of demand-reduction strategies. It is equally\r\nimportant that confirmed drug addicts be subjected to\r\nmandatory treatment and rehabilitation. Compulsory and\r\neffective treatment can make a substantial contribution to\r\nreducing the demand for illicit drugs.\r\nThese measures demand substantial financial\r\nallocations, which may be beyond the financial capability of\r\nmany countries. Our review should therefore look into\r\nalternative financing for these activities, particularly the\r\nquestion of the involvement of the private sector and\r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nInstitutionalizing collaborative efforts in demand\r\nreduction at the regional levels is important as well.\r\nMalaysia strongly believes that the establishment of a\r\nmechanism to deal with demand-reduction issues is long\r\noverdue. In this connection, it is recommended that the\r\nUNDCP establish regional meetings structured along the\r\nlines of the Meetings of the Heads of National Law\r\nEnforcement Agencies (HONLEA).\r\nThe recent Asian HONLEA meeting in Seoul brought\r\nto the fore a disturbing observation. There appears to be a\r\ndecline in the focus on drug issues among national\r\nGovernments. It is ironic that this should be so, particularly\r\nin view of the growing emergence of drug-related problems\r\nsuch as the transmission of the HIV virus, AIDS, and money\r\nlaundering. The international community should show\r\ngreater commitment to and determination in enforcing\r\nmeasures to control and prevent the drug problem.\r\nThe eradication of illicit drug production is another area\r\nrequiring early international action, given the general\r\nacceptance of the linkage between poverty and drug\r\nproduction. The issue is not as simple as that relating to\r\ncrop substitution, as it involves the question of social\r\ndevelopment, cultural particularity and the security of the\r\npoor peasants who are forced to cultivate coca or opium.\r\nUntil and unless the enormous scale and implications of this\r\nproblem are appreciated, all well-intended measures will\r\nprove to be ineffective.\r\nThe cornerstone of the United Nations effort to\r\neradicate drug production should be based on providing a\r\npractical alternative means of subsistence to drug growers.\r\nOne interesting proposal by the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme (UNDCP) calls for debt swap,\r\nwhereby part of the official debt payment of heavily\r\nindebted countries would be set aside for alternative\r\ndevelopment activities. In welcoming this proposal, we wish\r\nto emphasize the need for clear guidelines to ensure that the\r\nobjectives are met.\r\nThe suppression of illicit drug trafficking is another\r\nrelevant aspect in the fight against drug abuse.\r\nUnfortunately, over the years, there has been an\r\noveremphasis on and an inequitable allocation of resources\r\nto this particular aspect. Most countries in their initial\r\nefforts focused primarily on law enforcement and\r\ninterdiction. The United Nations itself has been and remains\r\ninfluenced by this line of thought, which has manifested\r\nitself in its overemphasis on drug-law-enforcement measures.\r\nThis has perhaps been inevitable because of the initial\r\nperception that if the flow of drugs can be stopped, the drug\r\nproblem can be eradicated. The truth, however, is that\r\nsuppression of drug trafficking and distribution is not the\r\npanacea to the drug problem. Today, no country can claim\r\nto have succeeded in reducing the inflow of drugs. There\r\nhas been no reduction in the illicit production, manufacture\r\nand consumption of and trafficking in drugs. Indeed, on the\r\ncontrary, there has been an increase in the production of\r\ndrugs. There is thus a need for a balanced and equitable\r\napproach by UNDCP in its programmes and activities,\r\nwithout veering predominantly towards law enforcement.\r\nWe agree with the observation in the reports of the\r\nCommission on Narcotic Drugs, the International Narcotics\r\nControl Board and UNDCP on the need for member\r\ncountries to show their commitment to the fight against drug\r\nabuse by ratifying and acceding to the three major\r\ninternational instruments on this matter: the Single\r\nConvention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, the Convention on\r\nPsychotropic Substances of 1971, and the United Nations\r\nConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\r\nPsychotropic Substances of 1988. Participation will ease\r\nnational control efforts and enable countries to participate in\r\ninternational activities. This is vital in the case of the newly\r\nindependent countries, whose non-participation in these\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 9\r\ninstruments will make them targets for drug traffickers.\r\nMalaysia ratified the 1988 Convention early this year.\r\nNational laws need to be updated in compliance with\r\ninternational drug treaties. It goes without saying that\r\ncountries should have an adequate legal framework to deal\r\nwith the drug problem because the lack of basic drug laws\r\nwould impede international cooperation. This is particularly\r\nrelevant to the newly independent States, such as those in\r\nEurope and the former Soviet Union.\r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies, including UNDCP\r\nand the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention\r\nand Criminal Justice, and international law-enforcement\r\norganizations need to interact and share, and collaborate in\r\nefforts to cope with organized-crime organizations and their\r\ninvolvement in terrorism and gun-running financed by\r\nrevenues they obtain from the illegal drug trade. Malaysia\r\nhas always advocated the need to standardize the treatment\r\nof drug-related offences. No criminal should have the\r\nliberty to seek refuge or safe haven in countries that impose\r\nminimal punishment for crimes related to drugs, whether it\r\nbe for illicit trafficking or for money laundering. There\r\nmust be a commonality of penalties that are meted out,\r\nallowing for sufficient deterrence of the perpetrators.\r\nMalaysia has the harshest of penalties, which is a reflection\r\nof our strong commitment to working towards a drug-free\r\nsociety while demonstrating our equally strong abhorrence\r\nof drug-related offences.\r\nBefore I conclude, allow me to reiterate Malaysia’s\r\nposition that we need to continuously review our joint efforts\r\nin fighting this menace. The threat from drug abuse and\r\nillicit trafficking is constantly changing in form and in\r\nintensity. We must be ahead of the criminals in our\r\nenduring task to defeat them. We must continue to hold on\r\nto our beliefs and principles. We must resist the temptation\r\nto engage in unilateral action to change the shape of the\r\nproblem by considering the legalization of drugs or their\r\nclassification as soft or hard drugs. Finally, we must\r\nstrengthen our collective international determination and\r\nefforts to fight this scourge against humanity successfully.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\non Mr. Carlos Larreategui, Attorney-General of Ecuador.\r\nMr. LARREATEGUI (Ecuador) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Before I begin my statement, I should like to\r\nexpress to the representative of Panama my delegation’s\r\nsorrow at the passing of his Foreign Minister, Mr. Julio\r\nLinares.\r\nEcuador has come to this great gathering - in which we\r\nconsider it a great privilege to participate - convinced that\r\nwe have a singular opportunity to meet, together, the\r\nchallenge posed by drug trafficking, which, together with\r\nterrorism, violence and corruption, threatens social peace and\r\ndemocracy and seriously jeopardizes the future of our\r\npeoples.\r\nIt is possible that at this stage of the proceedings\r\neverything, or almost everything, has already been said on\r\nthe subject. Perhaps all that will be new in my words will\r\nbe the way I speak them. Thus, and in order to comply with\r\nyour recommendation, Sir, that we be brief, I shall confine\r\nmyself to setting forth in broad terms what my country is\r\ndoing and plans to do on the subject that has brought us\r\ntogether and what it expects from the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMy country’s geographic situation has, regrettably,\r\nmade it a link in the chain of the illicit transit of drugs\r\nbetween South America and the United States and Europe.\r\nIn our region, Ecuador is a bridge between the producers of\r\ncoca and the processing and distribution centres. At the\r\nsame time, the chemical precursors used in refining centres\r\npass through Ecuador and return via the same route with\r\nprocessed drugs on their way to consumer markets.\r\nMoreover, my country is an important locus for the\r\nlaundering of illicit money.\r\nMy country’s complex position notwithstanding, the\r\nnational Government has responded firmly and soberly to the\r\ncriminal activities threatening not only the moral fibre of\r\nsociety but the integrity of its legal, social and public-order\r\ninstitutions. The reaction of our competent authorities to\r\nthese challenges has been swift and harsh. At the level of\r\npolice action, we have imprisoned the main perpetrators of\r\nthese crimes and seized their property - of which they have\r\na great deal. In the past year, we have confiscated some\r\n7,079 kilos of cocaine, 306 kilos of coca paste and 216 kilos\r\nof marijuana. At the administrative level, we have set up a\r\nNational Council for the Control of Narcotic and\r\nPsychotropic Substances, over which I have the honour to\r\npreside. This autonomous and independent body is\r\nresponsible for the prevention of the manufacture and the\r\ncontrol and inspection of chemical precursors and, through\r\nthe Ministry of Health, the rehabilitation of drug users.\r\nFurthermore, the Government of Ecuador, under\r\nMr. Sixto Durán Ballen, has adopted a firm and resolute\r\npolicy in its tireless fight against illicit drug trafficking.\r\nThis position was reiterated at the recent summit meeting of\r\nthe leaders of the Rio Group held in Santiago de Chile. To\r\nthat end, we have mobilized all the human, technical and\r\nmaterial resources available to the nation.\r\nThis year, we have adopted a five-year national plan to\r\nprevent and control the use of drugs, with the following\r\nobjectives: to reduce supply and demand; to make total\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nprevention a daily exercise in order to make our population\r\nphysically, psychologically and socially sound; to include\r\npreventive education in the normal and remedial educational\r\ncurriculums, backed up by a wide-ranging plan for training\r\nteachers; to protect each Ecuadorian as the greatest and best\r\nsource of intellectual, material, historical and cultural wealth;\r\nto commit ourselves to involving the voluntary sector,\r\nparticularly non-governmental organizations, in programmes\r\nand projects combating drug abuse; to coordinate actions\r\nwith specialized bodies in order to buttress, at the technical\r\nand operational levels, the agencies that are implementing\r\nthe national plan; to adopt programmes to promote\r\nalternative crops and for industrializing and marketing\r\nbeneficial products that can counteract drug production,\r\nconsumption and traffic; and to rescue ethical and moral\r\nvalues in the individual, the family and society.\r\nIn the legal field, Ecuador has signed and ratified many\r\nmultilateral instruments to do with drugs, and I should like\r\nto point out that Ecuador was one of the first countries to\r\nratify the 1988 Vienna Convention against Illicit Traffic in\r\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which has been\r\nincorporated into the Law on Narcotic and Psychotropic\r\nSubstances that Ecuador promulgated on 17 September 1990.\r\nOn the bilateral level, Ecuador has signed a number of\r\nconventions with the countries of the Andean area and with\r\nArgentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico, and also with\r\nGermany, the United Kingdom and the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Organization’s initiative of\r\nholding these high-level meetings in order to alleviate the\r\nconcern felt by many countries that the subject of\r\ninternational cooperation in the war on drugs would be put\r\non the back burner. In this regard, we agree with\r\nMr. Giorgio Giacomelli, Executive Director of the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme, who\r\nreminded us yesterday that drugs are a world-wide threat at\r\nleast as great as any other of the ills that are afflicting\r\nhumankind at this time of crisis.\r\nIn this connection, Ecuador is convinced that this\r\ndifficult enterprise requires States to stand shoulder to\r\nshoulder in solidarity. For its part, my country will continue\r\nto be assiduous in adopting internal measures to combat the\r\nmanifold adverse and corrupting manifestations of the drug\r\ntraffic.\r\nAlong these lines, we also believe that there should be\r\nan equal degree of commitment on the part of the consuming\r\ncountries, which must view this great crusade as a great\r\ncampaign in which the principle of equal responsibility is\r\nunequivocally recognized. This is why it is becoming ever\r\nmore urgent for enough resources and international\r\nassistance to be allocated to help us fulfil the obligation to\r\neradicate this ignominious scourge, an obligation that our\r\nsacred duty towards the future of our peoples imposes on us.\r\nAs many other speakers have emphasized, the war on\r\ndrugs requires resolute and coordinated action by all the\r\nworld’s peoples, and in which there is no room for\r\nindifference. My country will continue undaunted in the\r\nstruggle it has begun, and will offer its cooperation to other\r\nStates, in so far as we can, in order to ensure that the\r\nobjectives we are determined to achieve are indeed fulfilled.\r\nThe moment demands less rhetoric and more action.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on General El Sayed\r\nLotfi Gheith, Assistant Minister of the Interior of Egypt.\r\nMr. GHEITH (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): It\r\nis my great pleasure and honour to participate in this high-\r\nlevel meeting on behalf of General Hassan El Alfy, Egyptian\r\nMinister of the Interior, who sends the Assembly his sincere\r\ncompliments and best wishes for this General Assembly\r\nmeeting.\r\nThis meeting reflects the international community’s\r\ndetermination to continue its all-embracing struggle against\r\nthe narcotics evil. It also demonstrates the sincere desire of\r\nour peoples and Governments to expand our drug combating\r\nactivities and to devise more effective techniques in dealing\r\nwith this problem, which continues to be one of the gravest\r\nissues both at the national and international levels. We are\r\nconfident that this meeting will be able to formulate\r\neffectual recommendations which, when implemented, will\r\ncontribute to the cause of peace and security the world over.\r\nEgypt was one of the first States to recognize the\r\ngravity of the problem of narcotics. To Egypt’s credit is the\r\nfact that it was the first State in the world to enact the first\r\nlaw to criminalize hashish cultivation and importation, in\r\n1879 and the first to establish a law enforcement agency, in\r\n1929, specializing in combating illicit drugs, namely the\r\nAnti-Narcotics General Administration, over which I now\r\nhave the honour of presiding.\r\nEgypt has participated effectively in promoting\r\ninternational efforts to combat and control drugs through\r\naccession to various international conventions in this respect.\r\nEgypt has continued to play an active role in the\r\nCommission on Narcotic Drugs since its inception in 1946,\r\nand is also a member of its subcommission for the Near and\r\nMiddle Easts.\r\nAt the regional level, Egypt plays a vital role in both\r\nthe Arab and the African spheres. It focuses on cooperation\r\nand coordination with the various States concerned in\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 11\r\ncombating the illicit traffic in drugs in our region as well as\r\nthe transit trafficking targeting other regions of the world.\r\nEgypt has organized and/or participated in numerous\r\nconferences for Heads of Arab and African drug law-\r\nenforcement agencies, and our joint efforts have resulted in\r\nprosecution of a number of significant international cases in\r\nEgypt as well as in a number of other States.\r\nIn the area of training, Egypt contributes greatly to\r\ntraining officers of Arab and African drug law-enforcement\r\nagencies, and participates in implementing United Nations\r\nstrategy for training in the region. Our efforts in this\r\ndirection have received a considerable boost when Cairo was\r\nchosen, in 1990, as the headquarters for the first United\r\nNations Regional Training Centre established in Africa.\r\nAt another level, we also cooperate with a number of\r\nfriendly States, particularly Federal Germany, in organizing\r\njoint courses for African officers.\r\nWithin the parameters set by the principal goal of this\r\nmeeting, namely the assessment of our efforts and\r\nachievements in the area of international cooperation over\r\nthe past few years, I should like to present Egypt’s views\r\nand efforts, primarily in respect of the implementation of the\r\n1988 United Nations Convention and the Global Programme\r\nof Action.\r\nIn the field of criminalization and punishment, Egypt\r\nenacted in 1989 a new law, for which the 1988 Convention\r\nwas the main source of many of its provisions.\r\nConcerning the confiscation of narcotics assets,\r\nEgyptian legislation permits confiscation of the proceeds of\r\ndrug related crimes, and of any land or means of\r\ntransportation used in committing such crimes. Egyptian\r\nauthorities accord a high priority to cooperation with all the\r\nStates concerned in this field within the framework of\r\ninternational conventions and national legislation. We hope\r\nto benefit, in the near future, from the training and\r\nconsultative services as well as from the technical assistance\r\nthat will be provided by the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme to Member States in the context of\r\nthe efforts aimed at implementing the Global Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nIn the area of extradition, Egypt cooperates with other\r\nStates, both in terms of extradition and also in the exchange\r\nof prisoners, in consonance with the norms of international\r\nlaw, with the reservation concerning extradition of foreign\r\nprisoners in drug related cases, namely that extradition\r\nshould take place after service in Egypt by such prisoners of\r\nthe full sentence passed by Egyptian courts.\r\nEgypt sometimes allows drug consignments to enter its\r\nterritory or to transit under surveillance by its law\r\nenforcement agencies. We have used this method\r\nsuccessfully in arresting traffickers and in prosecuting\r\nseveral significant international cases, in cooperation with\r\npolice and customs authorities of a number of Arab, Asian\r\nand European States, as well as the law enforcement\r\nagencies of the United States of America.\r\nWith respect to the control of precursors, chemicals and\r\nsolvents used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and\r\npsychotropic substances, we have put several such\r\nsubstances under customs and security controls with the\r\nultimate aim of controlling all other substances listed in\r\ntables I and II of the 1988 Convention.\r\nIn connection with transit traffic in narcotics, Egypt\r\ncooperates with friendly States in joint programmes to fight\r\nnarcotics transit traffic operations; those programmes make\r\nuse of a detailed and accurate database.\r\nThe delegation of Egypt appeals to the United Nations\r\nand all its Member States to take urgent and effective steps\r\nto support combating activities in Africa and to redouble\r\ntheir contribution to that effort - which, so far, has not\r\nexceeded 6 per cent of United Nations drug-control outlays\r\nin 1992, a very modest contribution indeed given the grave\r\nindications that Africa is being increasingly targeted in the\r\narea of transit trafficking. I should also like to stress the\r\nimportance of extending assistance to Africa in alleviating\r\nthe effects of certain problems that exacerbate the drug\r\nsituation in the continent, such as unemployment,\r\nindebtedness, drought and desertification. Such problems\r\nshould be addressed through the creation of better\r\nopportunities for development in Africa and through opening\r\nthe markets of affluent States to Africa’s products.\r\nWith respect to detection and eradication of illicit\r\ncultivation, Egyptian law enforcement agencies continue to\r\nvigorously deploy efforts aimed at detecting and eradicating\r\nillicit drug cultivations with the help of the assistance\r\nextended to us under the long-term United Nations\r\nprogramme scheduled to run until 1995. We have signed the\r\nlatest of the relevant conventions of that programme in Cairo\r\non 28 September.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, I wish to convey our\r\nsincere appreciation to the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme (UNDCP) and its Executive Director,\r\nMr. Giorgio Giacomelli, for the active support that has\r\nenabled us to strengthen our efforts aimed at reducing the\r\narea of illicit cultivation and to limit the flow of drugs into\r\nEgypt and other countries.\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nOn the other hand, we hope that, in coordination with\r\nthe competent United Nations organs and with developed\r\ncountries, the UNDCP will adopt an international programme\r\nthat uses advanced technology for the accurate and timely\r\ndetection and eradication of illicit cultivation in various\r\nregions. Such a programme should be devised in\r\nconsultation with producer States and must embody restraints\r\nthat would safeguard the national security and sovereignty of\r\nsuch States while taking into account environmental and\r\npopulation safety considerations.\r\nOur aspiration after a drug-free world will be realized\r\nneither through good intentions, no matter how sincere, nor\r\nthrough country-specific efforts, no matter how effective\r\nthey may be. The attainment of that goal requires a sincere\r\ndedicated collective effort through the mechanisms created\r\nby international instruments, in a new spirit that transcends\r\nformalities and narrow interests and that opts decisively for\r\ncarrying through the much needed international struggle\r\nagainst this horrific scourge.\r\nI seize this opportunity to appeal to the General\r\nAssembly to call upon world leaders to intensify their\r\nmutual cooperation in facing up to all the threats and\r\nchallenges that confront the international community,\r\nespecially those posed by drug trafficking and terrorism.\r\nCreative action in this respect is certainly the best legacy we\r\ncan bequeath to our children and grandchildren - and to all\r\nmankind, which yearns for a better, brighter, more secure\r\nand prosperous world.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call next on His Excellency Mr.\r\nGeorge Ioan Danescu, Minister of the Interior of Romania.\r\nMr. DANESCU (Romania) (spoke in Romanian;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): I wish on behalf\r\nof the Romanian Government to convey our best wishes to\r\nall participants in these important meetings of the General\r\nAssembly devoted to the problem of drug abuse and drug\r\ntrafficking. We are most favourably impressed by the\r\ninternational community’s efforts and by the firm\r\ncommitments by Heads of State or Government to expand\r\nthose efforts into coordinated activities and to set priorities\r\nin the international fight against the illicit production,\r\nconsumption and trafficking of drugs.\r\nAs a result of the political, economic and social changes\r\nachieved during the transition period in Romania, the\r\ninstitutions of the rule of law have been created; hence,\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms are fully observed\r\nand respected, without discrimination, according to\r\ninternational standards.\r\nThe new direction recently promoted in our society in\r\nthe fields of law, the economy and politics have been\r\nperceived in various ways. For the majority of the\r\npopulation, these began a process of genuine freedom, but\r\nfor some people they represented new possibilities for\r\ncriminality, with drug-related crime holding a prominent\r\nplace.\r\nThe opening of our borders led to an enormous growth\r\nin the number of persons and vehicles and the quantities of\r\ngoods entering and leaving Romania. That opportune\r\nsituation has been exploited by networks of drug traffickers\r\nwho use Romania as an important bridge linking East and\r\nWest.\r\nIn addition to Romania’s special geographical position,\r\nwe must also consider the present situation in the former\r\nYugoslavia. Owing to the ongoing conflict in that country,\r\nthe hard core of drug trafficking has shifted to the second\r\nsegment of the \"Balkan route\", as it has been called - which\r\nincludes Romania. That is how criminal organizations avoid\r\nlosing large quantities of drugs that net them substantial\r\nsums of money.\r\nIn that connection, I must note that the huge sums of\r\nmoney generated by drug trafficking attract Romanian\r\ncitizens as well. Foreign criminal organizations send\r\nrepresentatives to try to make connections among Romanian\r\ncriminals; this promotes the organization and\r\ninternationalization of drug trafficking.\r\nAnother category of Romanians involved in this kind of\r\ncrime are individuals who left the country many years ago\r\nand settled abroad. Some have been recruited by\r\ninternational networks, and serve as their couriers or\r\nintermediaries. Over the years, they have accumulated large\r\nsums of money which, after December 1989, they invested\r\nin Romania, where they returned to live. The mafia-like\r\norganizations to which these people belong are stretching out\r\ntheir tentacles to our country; there are indications that some\r\nof the dirty money produced by drug trafficking is being\r\nlaundered in Romania.\r\nBut in spite of all that, we may safely say that no\r\nmarket for drugs has been created in Romania, and that\r\nRomania remains free of drug addicts. The only individuals\r\nidentified as drug addicts have been foreign residents or\r\nforeigners in Romania for one reason or another.\r\nGiven such considerations we may assert that Romania\r\nis merely a transit country for drugs bound for Western\r\nEurope, while at the same time it is being used as a turn-\r\nround point for the cocaine coming from South America.\r\nApart from what I have mentioned so far I should like\r\nto add that the Romanian legislation on drugs which\r\nregulates the activity of the competent authorities was\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 13\r\nadopted in 1969, a fact which somewhat hinders their\r\nactivity. A new draft law on narcotics has been worked out\r\nand submitted for discussion and passage to Parliament. We\r\ncan also say that we have taken an important step forward\r\nby ratifying the United Nations Convention against Illicit\r\nTraffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, the\r\nVienna Convention of 1988.\r\nFully aware that good results in the fight against drug\r\nabuse and drug trafficking can be achieved only on the basis\r\nof close cooperation with similar authorities in other\r\ncountries, we have made efforts to secure such cooperation\r\nwith organizations from Europe, America and Asia.\r\nThe exchange of information and the material support\r\ngranted by the United Nations and other organizations from\r\nthe above-mentioned continents were of the utmost help to\r\nus in the struggle against drug trafficking in our country.\r\nAs to the amount of seizures in Romania, they range\r\nbetween seizures of several grams and seizures of several\r\ntons. While in 1991, 35.82 kilograms of drugs were seized,\r\nin 1992 the amount was 30.521 kilograms, and since January\r\n1993 the amount of drugs seized has been\r\nll,396.165 kilograms. Among the most frequent drugs seized\r\nin 1993 we should mention cannabis, with a capture of\r\nll,183.160 kilograms.\r\nWe are also witnessing an intensification of the\r\nactivities carried out by criminal organizations from South\r\nAmerica, which are diversifying their methods of introducing\r\ninto Romania cocaine bound for Western Europe, with the\r\nparticipation of criminals from Canada, the United States of\r\nAmerica and Romania.\r\nAs to the licit production and the legal trafficking in\r\nnarcotic substances and products and of precursors and\r\nessential substances, strict controls operate both in the\r\ninstitutions that produce medicine containing narcotic\r\nsubstances and in those producing opium poppies for\r\nmedical use. All these steps that have been taken jointly by\r\ninterested bodies and organizations from Romania explain\r\nwhy there have been no cases of the diversion to criminal\r\nactivities of drugs and precursors from licit production\r\nsources. For the same purpose, measures have been taken\r\nby interested ministries to authorize the importation and\r\nexportation of the chemical essentials and precursors that\r\ncould be used for the illicit manufacturing of drugs.\r\nGiven this package of regulations we can firmly state\r\nthat in Romania there are no clandestine laboratories; and no\r\nsynthetic drugs have been discovered so far.\r\nAlthough we have no drug addicts among Romanian\r\ncitizens and therefore no deaths from overdose - at least not\r\nrecorded lately - the Romanian authorities have been\r\nconfronted with a relatively new phenomenon that is\r\nspreading fast. This is the inhaling by some young children\r\nand teenagers of volatile substances, which are not drugs in\r\nthe proper sense of the term, but which, in our opinion,\r\ncould lead to the taking of genuine drugs. With respect to\r\nsuch persons educational steps have been taken in\r\nconjunction with educational bodies, teachers, charitable\r\norganizations, schools and medical institutions.\r\nThe quite striking proportions of the drug problem\r\nrequire the elaboration of new strategies, new objectives and\r\ninternational cooperation mechanisms which, while\r\nrespecting and observing the sovereignty of States, should\r\nact more efficiently against the international trading\r\noperations of those persons who make fortunes by means of\r\nillegal drug trafficking and who endanger the stability of\r\nmany societies of the world.\r\nRomania, a signatory of all United Nations programmes\r\nand resolutions aimed at developing international cooperation\r\nin the fight against drug abuse and trafficking, intends to put\r\ninto effect the recommendations and conclusions of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly so as to limit the effects of\r\nthis scourge as much as possible.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Jorge Ramón Valdés, Attorney-General of\r\nPanama.\r\nMr. VALDES (Panama) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMr. President, the delegation of the Republic of Panama\r\nwishes to pay its respects to you and hopes that your\r\npresidency will be successful.\r\nSeen as a socio-economic phenomenon, drug\r\nconsumption has been reflecting growing tendencies that are\r\nextremely disquieting, and our children, our youth and our\r\nnational identity have been deeply affected by this dreadful\r\nscourge, in spite of the efforts to combat it.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Panama, at all\r\nlevels, has resolutely undertaken the implementation of a\r\npolicy aimed at putting into practice measures to prevent,\r\ncombat and curb drug abuse, narcotrafficking and the use of\r\nour financial and trade system for money-laundering, while\r\nat the same time making efforts to prevent the legitimization\r\nof activities arising out of narcotrafficking.\r\nWe are convinced that through preventive education we\r\nshall be able to combat this dreadful scourge and steal a\r\nmarch on crime, and that by educating youth and adults we\r\nshall achieve a deeper betterment of the human being and\r\nenhance self-esteem, thereby creating true social awareness\r\nagainst drugs by erecting a cultural barrier that will protect\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nour population from the harmful consequences of drug\r\ntrafficking.\r\nWe have also designed new national strategies, taking\r\ninto account primarily the development of integrated\r\nprevention policies by mobilizing our communities through\r\nmassive education of students at primary, secondary and\r\nuniversity levels. We have also developed programmes for\r\nspecialized training for civil servants, members of civic clubs\r\nand the staff of private enterprises throughout the country.\r\nWith regard to activities aimed at curbing the illicit\r\ndrug traffic and related crime, we would point out that the\r\nPublic Ministry - in an effort to strengthen the activities of\r\nthe Specialized Secretariat for Drug-Related Crimes in the\r\nAttorney-General’s Office, the offices in charge of summary\r\nproceedings and the Judicial Technical Police, which under\r\nthe law now comes under the Ministry’s supervision -\r\ncreated and installed in all judicial districts throughout the\r\ncountry specialized sub-secretariats for drug-related crimes.\r\nThese entities are responsible for any activity with regard to\r\nsummary proceedings, including issuing search warrants, for\r\ndrug-related crimes. Their work has already produced\r\nresults throughout the country, especially in the provinces\r\nwhich, because of their geographical peculiarities and the\r\ndevelopment of economic activities, are choice locations for\r\ndrug-processing.\r\nKnowing full well that for an effective fight against this\r\nscourge it is necessary to have international cooperation, the\r\nnational authorities have carried out a considerable number\r\nof operations jointly with the anti-drug agencies of the\r\nUnited States, INTERPOL and the German police, among\r\nother agencies, and have succeeded in confiscating large\r\nquantities of drugs and other items connected with this\r\ntraffic.\r\nWith regard to international legislation, we must make\r\nspecial mention of the fact that the 1988 United Nations\r\nConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\r\nPsychotropic Substances (the Vienna Convention) was\r\nrecently submitted to our legislative assembly for ratification\r\nand is being debated. Thus Panama continues to reaffirm its\r\npolicy of international cooperation with a view to the\r\neradication of drug trafficking and the consumption of illicit\r\nsubstances.\r\nWe wish to point out that the treaty between the\r\nRepublic of Panama and the United States of America on\r\nmutual legal assistance in penal matters was ratified by\r\nPanama by law 20 of 22 July 1991 and we hope it will enter\r\ninto force when it is ratified by the Congress of the United\r\nStates and formalized by an exchange of notes for the\r\nmutual benefit of our two countries. At the time of a\r\nrevision of the Special Law on Drugs, we concluded that it\r\nwas necessary to reform some of its articles and to\r\nincorporate new types of crime with a view to regulating\r\nillicit conduct not envisaged in the current legislation.\r\nIn view of all this, the Public Ministry, making use of\r\nthe legislative initiative granted to the Attorney-General of\r\nour country, has submitted to our parliament a draft law\r\ndesigned to reform the current legislation on drugs. The\r\ndraft makes provision for restructuring the penal standards\r\nin the field of international drug trafficking. We have\r\nincorporated provisions with regard to aggravating\r\ncircumstances in the purchase, sale and transshipment of\r\ndrugs; regulation of the procedure for the delivery of drugs\r\nunder surveillance and undercover operations. It is intended\r\nthat goods seized because of a connection with drug-related\r\ncrimes be used in campaigns for the prevention of crime,\r\nrehabilitation, and the suppression of drug trafficking. In\r\naddition, we have established two offices of the public\r\nprosecutor which specialize in drug-related crimes and which\r\nwould have competence and jurisdiction throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\nAll these changes are aimed at the formulation of a\r\nspecial law on drugs, the fundamental purpose of which is\r\nmaintenance of the struggle against drug trafficking through\r\nthe preventive functions of the penal law.\r\nAs regards the laundering of drug-related money, we\r\ncan see that every day we are confronted by new methods\r\nused by drug dealers to separate their income from illicit\r\nsources from their principal source, through the creation of\r\ncomplex financial transactions which give the appearance of\r\nlegitimacy to their funds. To deal with this situation, the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Panama has in its judicial\r\nsystem a number of measures for enforcing the controls for\r\nthe prevention of the laundering of money derived from drug\r\ntrafficking. Under the special law on drugs there is\r\nprovision for sanctions against all those who, in one way or\r\nanother, participate in the crime of money laundering.\r\nAnother measure taken by the Government to curb this\r\nactivity is Cabinet decree No. 41 of 1990, which requires\r\nbanks to obtain proper identification of their clients and to\r\nhave them provide information about the sources of deposits\r\nand the purposes of cash withdrawals amounting to more\r\nthan $10,000.\r\nOur Supreme Court has issued various rulings and\r\njudicial orders imposing on the people involved in these\r\noperations an obligation to supply all the required\r\ninformation to the penal authorities on a given bank account\r\nwhile making it clear that our country respects the\r\nconfidentiality of certain bank accounts. However, this has\r\nnothing to do with the concept of secret accounts.\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 15\r\nTo this end and in order to maintain a salutary financial\r\ncentre, the members of the national banking community have\r\nissued a number of agreements concerning the identification\r\nof financial transactions involving cash, cheques, travellers\r\ncheques and other payment orders with blank endorsements.\r\nThe Bankers’ Association of Panama, which brings together\r\nalmost all the banks in the country, has laid down rules that\r\nprevent members from making improper use of its services.\r\nThe Republic of Panama, which is based on the\r\nprinciples of protecting life, strict legality, respect for legal\r\ninstitutions, both basic and operational, both national and\r\ninternational, is determined to use whatever means are\r\navailable to put an end to the terrible scourge of drug\r\ntrafficking.\r\nIn the face of this phenomenon, which is changing\r\nconstantly, the objectives of the Republic of Panama may be\r\nstated as follows: first, our primary responsibility is to\r\nprotect the physical, mental and emotional state of the\r\npeople affected by chemical substances; secondly, we must\r\nprotect the national political, social, economic and financial\r\nstructures against organized crime, whose participants try to\r\nuse our geographical position and our financial and trade\r\nsystem for their own purposes; thirdly, we must strengthen\r\nthe links of cooperation and international solidarity through\r\nbilateral and multilateral conventions to curb drug trafficking\r\nin all its manifestations.\r\nWe should like to sum up the position of Panama in\r\nthis great struggle by the civilized world against the\r\nincreasing threat of drug trafficking, in the words: Panama\r\nis fighting! And it is fighting despite the fact that the drug\r\nbarons are trying to use the country, because of its location,\r\nas a springboard for their deadly cargoes. But we are not\r\ndaunted by economic limitations or transitory political\r\nchanges. Panama is organizing. We are legislating and are\r\nperfecting our police and investigation activities. We have\r\nstrict regulations against money laundering. All our efforts\r\nare directed against drugs. We are complying literally with\r\nconventions and treaties, and we are beginning to see\r\npositive signs which should be an example and model for\r\nother nations that have to contend with similar problems. It\r\nis with pride that we say that Panama is fighting and is\r\nachieving its goals.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Mr. Roan Perera,\r\nSecretary to the Legal Committee of the National Dangerous\r\nDrugs Control Board of Sri Lanka.\r\nMr. PERERA (Sri Lanka): The delegation of Sri\r\nLanka welcomes the convening of these high-level plenary\r\nmeetings on international drug control to examine the status\r\nof international cooperation against drug abuse and drug\r\ntrafficking. The according of special importance to the\r\nsubject and this stocktaking exercise by the international\r\ncommunity are timely. The question of international drug\r\ncontrol does indeed demand high priority, given the political,\r\neconomic and social dimensions of the problem and the\r\ngrave threat that it poses to the health and life of our people,\r\nparticularly the youth of our countries.\r\nMoreover, new and alarming dimensions of drug\r\ntrafficking have emerged in the post-cold-war period. The\r\nramifications of the nexus between narcotics peddlers,\r\nterrorists and the illicit arms trade now go beyond the\r\nsocio-economic sphere and pose an ever-increasing threat to\r\npeace and security within and between nations in many parts\r\nof the world. The residue of the excessive armament\r\ninventories of the cold-war era has resulted in open arms\r\nbazaars. All types of armed groups, including powerful\r\ncommercial interests that drive the illicit drug trade, have\r\naccess to this sophisticated military hardware. Drug\r\npeddlers, terrorists and gun runners seem to have joined\r\nforces to create elaborate international networking\r\narrangements to provide the funding and the logistics for this\r\ndeadly trade in illicit drugs and arms.\r\nThe results of this self-sustaining cycle of violence and\r\nsocial disintegration are only too evident in the increasing\r\nnumber of terrorist and drugs-related conflicts around the\r\nworld. International preventive diplomacy and efforts in the\r\narea of national political reconciliation will not be fully\r\nsuccessful so long as the flows of illicit arms and of illicit\r\ndrugs support each other. These act as a formidable\r\ncounterforce to political efforts, at national and international\r\nlevels, towards the prevention or resolution of conflicts. The\r\nterrorists will have no incentive to turn away their financiers\r\nand enter the democratic process of political expression, and\r\nthe drug dealers will have no incentive to discard their\r\n\"valued customers\", unless the international community takes\r\nconcerted and integrated action against this twin evil of\r\nnarco-terrorism and the illicit arms trade.\r\nMr. Kabir (Bangladesh), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe growing complexity and the multifaceted\r\ndimensions of the problem of drug abuse and drug\r\ntrafficking therefore require a carefully coordinated policy\r\nand a plan of action at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nThe Government of Sri Lanka recently adopted a\r\nnational plan on drug abuse and drug control which takes\r\ninto account the national, regional and international aspects\r\nof this question. At the national level, the National\r\nDangerous Drugs Control Board is the principal agency in\r\nSri Lanka dealing with the question of drug control. The\r\nfunctions of the Board relate to all aspects of prevention and\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nreduction of drug abuse, the control of the supply of drugs\r\nand the treatment, rehabilitation and social reintegration of\r\ndrug addicts. The Police Narcotic Bureau, which is a\r\nspecialized unit within the police department, deals with\r\nsuppression of illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and\r\npsychotropic substances.\r\nOn the aspect of demand-reduction programmes, the\r\nNational Dangerous Drugs Control Board has taken a series\r\nof measures focusing on special target groups such as\r\neducational institutions. We are conscious of the need to\r\nimplement demand-reduction programmes in a supportive\r\nenvironment with the active support of parents and\r\ncommunity leaders. At the regional level, during the first\r\nweek of this month Sri Lanka hosted a regional seminar,\r\nunder the auspices of the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC), to work out modalities for\r\nthe prevention and reduction of drug abuse in the South\r\nAsian countries.\r\nWith regard to the treatment, rehabilitation and social\r\nreintegration of drug addicts, the Dangerous Drugs Control\r\nBoard implements a programme of treatment, rehabilitation\r\nand reintegration in close cooperation with non-governmental\r\norganizations which are active in the field of drug control.\r\nDraft legislation has also been finalized by the Board’s\r\nlegislative committee to provide a comprehensive legal\r\nframework for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug\r\noffenders. The law envisages treatment and rehabilitation of\r\ndrug offenders through institutions managed by the Board as\r\nwell as through private institutions which are subject to\r\nsupervision by the Board. The draft legislation also provides\r\nfor a court order for treatment and rehabilitation in lieu of a\r\npenal sentence, in appropriate cases. It also provides for\r\nvoluntary submission to treatment and rehabilitation.\r\nIn the field of international drug control, Sri Lanka is\r\na State party to the principal international legal instruments.\r\nSri Lanka recently ratified the United Nations Convention\r\nagainst Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\r\nSubstances of 1988 and also the 1971 Convention on\r\nPsychotropic Substances. At the regional level, Sri Lanka is\r\na party to the SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs and\r\nPsychotropic Substances, which was adopted in 1991 and\r\nwhich entered into force on 15 September 1993. The\r\nSAARC Convention reaffirms and supplements at the\r\nregional level the principal international legal instruments in\r\nthe field of drug control.\r\nA coordinated programme of international cooperation\r\nis essential for dealing with the problem of narcotic drugs,\r\ngiven the transboundary dimensions of this problem. The\r\n1988 United Nations Convention provides a comprehensive\r\nlegal regime to combat the problem through the\r\nestablishment of drug offences as grave criminal offences,\r\nthe incorporation of the \"extradite or prosecute\" principle\r\nand the related concept of universal jurisdiction in relation\r\nto drug offences and measures to promote international\r\njudicial cooperation to address such acts of criminality. We\r\nalso note that the draft statute for the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal court formulated recently by the\r\nInternational Law Commission covers the offences under the\r\n1988 United Nations Convention, although further\r\nelaboration is required on some elements of the matter\r\nrelating to the Court’s jurisdiction.\r\nA legal workshop for South Asian countries on the\r\nimplementation of the 1988 United Nations Convention,\r\nsponsored by the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP), is currently being held in Colombo.\r\nWe are very grateful to UNDCP for sponsoring this\r\nworkshop in Sri Lanka; it will no doubt benefit the Asian\r\ncountries. A well-coordinated programme of cooperation at\r\nthe regional level would undoubtedly supplement and\r\nstrengthen measures of international drug control.\r\nThe development of mechanisms for the exchange of\r\ninformation and intelligence related to drug offences forms\r\nan important part of the international strategy to combat the\r\nproblem. Sri Lanka took the initiative within the SAARC\r\nforum for the establishment of a mechanism for enhancing\r\nthe effectiveness of law-enforcement action in the region and\r\nfor maintaining channels of communication for the secure\r\nand rapid exchange of information between the concerned\r\nagencies of Member States. A Regional Drug Offences\r\nMonitoring Desk has now been established; it is located at\r\nthe Sri Lanka Police Narcotic Bureau. A directory of\r\nnational focal points of concerned agencies of SAARC\r\ncountries has also been finalized. These measures for\r\nmutual assistance already implemented in the SAARC region\r\ncould form the basis for wider cooperation, as envisaged\r\nunder the United Nations Convention.\r\nSri Lanka, for its part, stands ready to enter into\r\ncooperative arrangements with countries of other regions on\r\nthe question of drug trafficking. Only a comprehensive\r\nnetwork of arrangements at the bilateral, regional and\r\ninternational levels could meet the threat posed by\r\ninternational drug trafficking, which, unless effectively\r\ncountered through a well-coordinated global plan of action,\r\nwould end the political, economic and social fabric of all\r\nnations.\r\nSri Lanka is therefore pleased to support the draft\r\nresolution on international drug control, which provides a\r\nframework for enhanced international cooperation in drug\r\ncontrol and the fight against drug abuse.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nGuatemala.\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 17\r\nMr. MARTINI HERRERA (Guatemala) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): Before taking up the subject before us, I\r\nshould like to express, on behalf of the Central American\r\nCommunity, our deepest sympathy to the people, the\r\nGovernment and, especially, the Mission of Panama, and to\r\nthe family of His Excellency the late Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Panama, Mr. Julio Linares, who\r\ndied early this morning in this city, where he had come to\r\ntake part in these meetings of the Assembly.\r\nThe Central American countries of Costa Rica, El\r\nSalvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama have\r\ndecided to participate jointly in dealing with in one of the\r\nmost important aspects of international relations, one that has\r\nnegative effects on the social and economic development of\r\nall the nations of the world, be they industrialized or\r\ndeveloping.\r\nThe impact of drug crime, its scope and its invasion of\r\nour societies upset and erode our basic social, economic,\r\ncultural, political and legal structures, thus endangering the\r\nvery political stability of nations and bringing about an\r\nunbridled increase in violence, corruption and insecurity.\r\nThe seventeenth special session of the General\r\nAssembly was devoted to the international fight against the\r\nabuse of and illicit trafficking in drugs, and it culminated in\r\nthe adoption of the Political Declaration and the Global\r\nProgramme of Action on international cooperation against\r\nthe production, supply, demand, and illicit trafficking in and\r\ndistribution of narcotics and psychotropic substances. Last\r\nyear the General Assembly decided to devote four plenary\r\nmeetings this year to an evaluation of the progress made.\r\nThe Central American countries believe that the\r\nactivities of the international community in the struggle to\r\neradicate this problem have been effective, albeit of limited\r\nscope. On the one hand, sophisticated monitoring and\r\ncommunications systems have made possible seizures of\r\nsuch substances worldwide. On the other hand, the\r\nunderlying causes of production and unlawful trafficking in\r\ndrugs have not been properly tackled.\r\nThe poverty, destitution and despair of large portions of\r\nthe population, particularly in rural areas, create a fertile\r\nfield in which the cartels and other organized groups can\r\ndevote their substantial profits to the production of illicit\r\ncrops. This has a negative impact on the environment\r\nbecause of land clearance and the use of herbicides and\r\nother chemical substances that find their way into rivers and\r\nlakes, or stay in the soil.\r\nMany countries have been adversely affected by\r\npolitical conflicts, geopolitical changes, pandemics,\r\nrecessions and economic restructuring, all of which have\r\nupset the usual harmony of society. Drugs have come to be\r\nviewed as promising a temporary escape. Worse still, the\r\nproduction of and traffic in illicit substances are the major\r\nsource of funds for armed groups seeking political power\r\nthrough fratricidal wars.\r\nThe unfavourable international economic situation plays\r\na preponderant role in increased drug production. The\r\nprevailing theory of supply and demand and free-market\r\ntrends in international trade have led to a drastic fall in the\r\nprices of legal export products. In Central America, for\r\nexample, the drastic drop in the price of export commodities\r\nhas caused a deep economic recession. The industrialized\r\ncountries have begun to implement trade measures that\r\nrestrict the import of bananas into their markets. Some of\r\nour countries have been threatened by the application of\r\nforeign labour laws, to the detriment of our legal production.\r\nThe countries involved are also the market par excellence\r\nfor our drugs, for, again in accordance with the law of\r\nsupply and demand, consumers in the industrialized countries\r\nare prepared to pay excessive sums for narcotics, but do not\r\nwant to pay a fair price for lawful products. A long-term\r\nresponse to the problem of drug trafficking would be to\r\nincrease the productivity of and income from conventional\r\nagriculture. We must promote dynamic agricultural\r\ndevelopment on the basis of viable international agreements\r\nguaranteeing fair, remunerative and stable prices for the\r\nproducers of licit goods. This is a topic the General\r\nAssembly must now take up seriously.\r\nThe Central American countries have tackled the\r\nproblem of narcotics in the businesslike manner it demands.\r\nThe Central American Presidents have referred to the need\r\nto promote international as well as subregional cooperation\r\nin the fight against drug trafficking. They are well aware of\r\nthe special geographical position of Central America, which\r\ninternational cartels have taken advantage of, using the\r\nregion as an air and maritime bridge for drugs en route to\r\nnorthern markets. They know that the region’s technological\r\nand financial resources are too limited to carry out more\r\ncareful monitoring of drug trafficking. It is time people\r\nunderstood the immense seriousness of the problem.\r\nNevertheless, the Central American region has increased\r\nthe financial resources it devotes to the international effort\r\nand has initiated plans and programmes on prevention,\r\ninvestigation, intelligence gathering and information. We are\r\nalso putting in place systems to monitor, control and register\r\nair, sea, land, lake and river traffic. Efforts are being made\r\nto locate clandestine landing areas, aircraft refuelling points,\r\nwarehouses and raw materials. We are working to locate\r\nand destroy poppy and marijuana crops, as well as other\r\nsimilar crops for which Central America provides fertile soil.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe Central American countries have cooperated with\r\ninternational agencies and organs and have held seminars on\r\nthe technical assistance the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme can provide. They have\r\nparticipated with other interested countries, particularly the\r\nUnited States of America, in efforts to combat drug\r\ntrafficking, in strict compliance with the principles of\r\ninternational law respecting the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of all States, and have signed extradition\r\nagreements that make it possible to apprehend and try drug\r\nlords. Central America rejects, however, the extraterritorial\r\napplication of the laws of other countries on its territory and\r\nany attempt to pursue such policies, whether within or\r\noutside the region.\r\nCentral America believes the international community\r\nmust reaffirm the priority given in the Global Programme of\r\nAction to the prevention and reduction of the illegal use of\r\nnarcotic substances, for which purpose sufficient resources\r\nmust be allocated. At the same time, we consider that much\r\nmore information and additional financing are required to\r\nhelp the region wage more energetically the war against\r\nillegal drug production and trafficking.\r\nThe sophistication of international cartels and the\r\noverall international economic situation have resulted in\r\nlimited achievements for the Global Programme of Action\r\nand national and subregional programmes. Crop substitution\r\nprogrammes have not been effective enough. Governments\r\nin the North seem to be concentrating on attempting to\r\npersuade Governments in the South to halt the cultivation\r\nand processing of drug-related crops and to prevent their sale\r\nabroad. That approach, however, ignores the fact that the\r\ndriving force behind the drug trade is its enormous\r\nprofitability, owing to the increased demand in the North.\r\nThat problem has not been effectively tackled.\r\nThe Central American countries are parties to the\r\ninternational drug-control instruments, including the United\r\nNations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs\r\nand Psychotropic Substances of 1988. Their Governments\r\nhave received for consideration a plan to establish a Central\r\nAmerican standing commission on the eradication of the\r\nproduction, trafficking, consumption and use of narcotics and\r\npsychotropic substances, which was drawn up at the ninth\r\nSummit meeting of Central American Presidents, held in\r\nPuntarenas, Costa Rica, in December 1990.\r\nIt is hoped that the proposed Central American\r\ncommission will begin to function at an early date, because\r\nwe are convinced that its activities could significantly\r\npromote cooperation between the countries of the region in\r\nthis struggle. The convention creating the commission is to\r\nbe signed at the fourteenth Summit meeting of Central\r\nAmerican Presidents, to be held in Guatemala at the end of\r\nthis month.\r\nLast February an anti-drug conference attended by\r\nCentral American Heads of Government was held in Belize\r\nCity to consider coordinating regional efforts to combat the\r\nillicit production, trafficking and consumption of drugs. In\r\nits Final Declaration it deplored the drug scourge and\r\nreaffirmed the commitment to make every effort to prevent\r\nthe region’s being used for such purposes. It expressed the\r\nconviction that only through regional efforts could a solution\r\nbe found to the problem created by the use of the region for\r\nillegal production, trafficking and consumption.\r\nThe Central American Governments reaffirmed on that\r\noccasion the importance of coordinating their efforts with the\r\nInter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, with the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme and\r\nwith the United Nations Latin American Institute for the\r\nPrevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders in\r\nCosta Rica.\r\nThe Central American Presidents who met in Panama\r\nstated:\r\n\"We reiterate our vigorous condemnation of the\r\nproduction of, trafficking in and illicit consumption of\r\ndrugs. We reaffirm our commitment to make every\r\npossible effort to prevent our countries from becoming\r\na base for drug trafficking, as this leads to actions\r\nperpetrated against society and violates the fundamental\r\nhuman rights of individuals. At the same time, we\r\nagree to intensify regional cooperation and international\r\ncooperation to eradicate this scourge\".\r\nDomestic legislation has been improved in each country\r\nwhere this was needed, and in some cases new legislation\r\nhas been enacted. In Costa Rica, a National Drug Council\r\nwas established, and the Ministry of Justice adopted a drug\r\nprogramme. The Assembly of El Salvador enacted a law\r\ngoverning drug-related activities, thus introducing certain\r\nchanges into older legislation. In September, the anti-drug\r\ndivision of the civilian national police was instituted. It has\r\nestablished relations based on cooperation and exchange of\r\ninformation with the countries in the area: Colombia,\r\nMexico and the United States.\r\nIn Guatemala, a Commission Against Drug Addiction\r\nand Illicit Trafficking was created. A law on drug-related\r\nactivities has been enacted, allocating more resources to this\r\nproblem, and norms, methods and procedures were adopted\r\nto implement justice speedily and efficiently. In Nicaragua,\r\na National Drug Commission has been created. The\r\nNational Assembly has already received for study a draft\r\nlaw, on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 19\r\npenal legislation on this subject does not allow the release on\r\nbail of any criminals involved in drug trafficking.\r\nThe Central American region is well aware of the need\r\nto adopt programmes and measures, on a regional basis, in\r\norder to treat, rehabilitate and bring about the social\r\nreinsertion of persons affected, particularly young people,\r\nand is also aware of the need for adequate educational\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe Central American countries are convinced that\r\nwithout an improvement in the economic conditions of the\r\nregion, their efforts to combat drugs will have only a very\r\nlimited effect. And that is why we would emphasize once\r\nagain the need to enhance international cooperation and\r\nestablish an ongoing programme in our countries, including\r\nprogrammes to deal with the production and marketing of\r\nalternative agricultural products. We need an improvement\r\nin terms of trade, we need investments that help our\r\neconomies, a reduction in our debt, and we need support for\r\nour economic and social development, respecting all the\r\nwhile the environment and the culture of our peoples.\r\nThe international community, and in particular the\r\nUnited Nations, must serve as a central forum to promote\r\ncooperation and improve general living standards. The fight\r\nagainst narcotics must be given top priority. It must move\r\nahead and in this way, our planet can be shared in a peaceful\r\nand healthy way by one and all.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Police General\r\nChavalit Yodmani of Thailand.\r\nMr. YODMANI (Thailand): It is a great pleasure and\r\nhonour for me to address the Assembly today.\r\nThese special meetings of the General Assembly\r\nreaffirm the priority that the United Nations attaches to\r\ninternational drug control. Our task as high-level\r\nrepresentatives of various Governments is to review the\r\nprogress made to date and inject the process with the\r\npolitical will that is so essential to the movement towards\r\neradication of the problem.\r\nThe problem of the abuse and illicit trafficking of\r\ndrugs, as we all are aware, has dramatically increased in\r\nscope and complexity. Despite drug-control measures, the\r\ndemand for and illicit production and trafficking of drugs\r\ncontinue to rise. It is painfully clear that serious problems\r\nrelated to the use of drugs have emerged, among them HIV\r\nand AIDS resulting from intravenous drug use and violent\r\ncrimes caused by drug addiction and the drug trade. The\r\ndiversity of the drug problem is also reflected in the\r\ndiversion of chemicals used for the illicit production of\r\ndrugs, and its complexity is due to the huge profits possible\r\nin the illicit drug trade.\r\nThailand has fully committed itself to the fight against\r\nthis drug menace. What we have done is self-explanatory.\r\nThailand is a Party to the 1961 Convention amended by the\r\n1972 Protocol, and also to the 1971 Convention. Even\r\nthough we have not yet acceded to the 1988 Convention, we\r\nhave already put many of the measures provided in the\r\nConvention into action. We are proud to say that much of\r\nwhat we have done is in line with the strategies outlined in\r\nthe Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline and the Global\r\nProgramme of Action. We have set our priorities within the\r\ncontext of a clearly defined and achievable national strategy\r\nwhich provides the proper balance between the demand for\r\ndrugs and a reduction in the drug supply.\r\nThailand would like to commend the United Nations for\r\nits adoption of the Global Programme of Action, which\r\noutlines the integrated strategies on drug abuse control.\r\nHowever, the implementation of the Global Programme of\r\nAction can be achieved only through the concerted efforts of\r\nevery nation in translating the words of the Global\r\nProgramme of Action into concrete action. We are of the\r\nview that to help implement the Global Programme of\r\nAction, technical assistance and financial support from the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme\r\n(UNDCP), in cooperation with other United Nations\r\nspecialized agencies, should be provided to the relevant\r\ncountries, particularly the developing ones, for the drafting\r\nof their master plans on drug control. The necessary support\r\nand the provision of adequate resources would enable the\r\ncountries to effectively implement their programmes.\r\nThe subregional concept initiated by UNDCP is another\r\nlaudable example of international cooperation in the fight\r\nagainst the scourge of drugs. Thailand fully supports\r\nUNDCP’s initiative, because we believe that one country\r\nalone cannot effectively overcome the problem. Countries\r\nthat belong to the same geographical region should join\r\nhands and work together to eliminate this pervasive evil.\r\nIn this belief, Thailand has been working closely with\r\nall the member countries of the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) in a concerted effort to fight\r\nagainst drugs. Thailand also initiated the First Ministerial\r\nConference on Cooperation on Drug Abuse Control between\r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and\r\nThailand in March 1992, which resulted in a Joint\r\nDeclaration of the three countries stating their firm\r\ncommitment to alleviate the drug problem. To strengthen\r\ncooperation between the three countries and to translate the\r\nDeclaration into practical action, a Three-Year Narcotics\r\nControl Assistance Plan was drawn up by the Royal Thai\r\nGovernment to provide training in the fields of both supply\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nand demand reduction to officials from the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic and Myanmar. The implementation of\r\nthis Plan will begin next year.\r\nMoreover, Thailand participates actively in the UNDCP\r\nsubregional project between Myanmar and Thailand, and\r\nyesterday we signed the Memorandum of Understanding\r\nbetween the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar,\r\nthe People’s Republic of China, Thailand and UNDCP,\r\nwhich will serve as a cooperative framework on narcotics\r\ncontrol in that subregion. This will open a new chapter of\r\nconcerted efforts between all parties concerned.\r\nThe war against drugs will never be won if demand\r\nreduction efforts are overlooked; new kinds of drugs will\r\nalways arise to replace old ones. Sometimes substances that\r\nare not even narcotic drugs are used, such as glue and other\r\nvolatile substances. Thus, the problem lies mainly with the\r\nindividual. Demand reduction should help the individual\r\nresist those destructive habits and encourage him or her to\r\nlive a healthy and useful life in society. Most importantly,\r\nthis effort should be supported by the people, as they are the\r\nones who know and face the problem. The Royal Thai\r\nGovernment has tried to encourage greater participation by\r\nthe people in our anti-narcotics programmes, and the results\r\nare quite satisfactory.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would like to say that we have\r\ncome a long way and still have many roads to travel and\r\nhills to climb, but the knowledge that we are not alone\r\nmakes this journey much easier. So I would take this\r\nopportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the countries\r\nthat have cooperated with us and helped us in our narcotics-\r\ncontrol efforts. I would also like to reiterate Thailand’s firm\r\npolicy against drugs. We pledge to do our best and stand\r\nready to work with all countries to keep the momentum\r\ngoing, because if we are to defeat this global menace, we\r\nmust be united in purpose and act together.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Mr. Eamonn\r\nDoherty, Senior Drugs Coordinator of Ireland.\r\nMr. DOHERTY (Ireland): Let me begin by saying that\r\nI fully support the speech made by the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister of Belgium on behalf of the European Community.\r\nLet me also say what a signal honour it is for me to be\r\npresent here at these high-level plenary meetings of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on drugs. I strongly believe that by\r\nadopting a Political Declaration and a Global Programme of\r\nAction in February 1990 we gave an important impetus to\r\nthe international community to take positive action in the\r\nfight against a major scourge which threatens the very fabric\r\nof all our societies, a disease which threatens the future of\r\nour young people and thus the future of mankind.\r\nDuring Ireland’s presidency of the European\r\nCommunity in 1990 I had the privilege of chairing the first\r\nmeetings of the European Community’s senior coordinators\r\nin the fight against drugs. This group was composed of the\r\npersonal representatives of the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the twelve member States of the European\r\nCommunity, and its coming into being underlined the\r\nseriousness with which these senior political figures viewed\r\nthe problem of drugs. During the first half of 1990 we drew\r\nup and presented to the European Council in Dublin the draft\r\nof the European Plan to Combat Drugs. This Plan was\r\nfinalized in December 1990 under the Italian presidency, and\r\nforms the cornerstone of European policy in the fight against\r\ndrugs.\r\nUnder the Irish presidency we also put in place a very\r\nimportant group in the fight against drugs, one which I am\r\nhappy to say carries the name of the Dublin Group. In\r\nbringing together the United States, Canada, Australia,\r\nJapan, Norway and Sweden with the European Community\r\nand its member States and the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Prograame (UNDCP), it provides a forum for\r\ninformal consultations which play an important role in\r\ndirecting the policies and actions of the countries involved.\r\nIn order to respond positively to situations in different parts\r\nof the world, regional groups and within them mini-Dublin\r\ngroups were established in major capitals in order to analyse\r\nand respond effectively to the drug problem in different\r\nregions and to enhance the overall understanding of the\r\nproblem.\r\nHowever, I believe that, despite the important role\r\nwhich we can play in the European Community and through\r\ngroupings such as the Dublin Group, in the fight against\r\ndrugs we need to coordinate our activities on a world-wide\r\nbasis through the United Nations if we wish our efforts to\r\nwork effectively towards the eradication of a problem which,\r\nthough it may take different forms in different countries and\r\nregions of the world, still remains a problem we must all\r\nface in common. The drug problem is a classic example of\r\na global challenge. Despite the efforts we have all made\r\nnationally, regionally and internationally, and despite our\r\nmany successes, I do not believe we can say that we have\r\nseen any major improvement in the drug-abuse problem.\r\nWhilst we have been fortunate, insofar as the drug\r\nproblem in Ireland is small by international standards - due\r\nin small part to the close family structure of our society - it\r\nis a matter which has always been accorded a high priority\r\nby successive Irish Governments. Both enforcement and\r\nrehabilitation measures are kept under constant review, and\r\nwe have seen an increase in seizures of drugs and in the\r\nnumber of people charged with drug offences, particularly\r\nimportation and trafficking. In 1992 there was an increase\r\nof 13 per cent in the number of people charged under the\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 21\r\nMisuse of Drugs Acts. At the same time, there was an\r\nincrease of 20 per cent in the number of drug seizures.\r\nHowever we are very conscious at all times that arrests and\r\nseizures will not by themselves provide the answer to the\r\nproblem; for that reason we pay close attention to the\r\nimportant issues of health care and rehabilitation.\r\nDespite all these measures, we in Ireland have seen a\r\ngradual deterioration in the level of abuse, particularly of\r\ncannabis resin. In line with our priorities we are at this\r\npoint in time critically examining the national policy on all\r\naspects of the problem including the adequacy of the\r\nresources available to the various enforcement, education and\r\nother agencies involved.\r\nWhilst we will continue to enhance our national\r\nprogramme, it is only through a concerted international effort\r\nthat we can hope to make any impact on the scale of the\r\nproblem facing us. It is a problem which is so widespread\r\nthat we regularly find further areas into which its tentacles\r\nhave reached. We must not look to the problem of\r\nproduction alone but to the reasons for production. We must\r\nnot look to the problem of consumption alone but to the\r\nreasons for this consumption.\r\nWe must take account of the economic and social\r\nfactors which play an important role in many of the producer\r\ncountries. When we talk of alternative development and\r\ncrop substitution, we must ensure that what we are offering\r\nis a real alternative and a substitute crop for which there is\r\na real market. We must also look to how we deal with the\r\ntraffickers, who have great wealth and power and who have\r\na vested interest in ensuring the production of the illicit\r\ncrops which have made them so powerful.\r\nWe, in determining our actions, must take account of\r\nthe fact that drug trafficking, from the patterns which we\r\nhave seen, appears to consist of tightly knit, highly organized\r\nnetworks that span across countries and regions throughout\r\nthe world. Seizures which have taken place appear to\r\nrepresent only a small percentage of what is being trafficked\r\nas evidence suggests that they rarely affect market prices.\r\nThis is a clear indication of the enormity of the problem\r\nwhich faces us.\r\nWhen we turn to the problem of consumption, we must\r\nturn our attention to the underlying socio-economic factors.\r\nIn our Western world we find drug addiction problems both\r\namong the poor and socially deprived of our populations and\r\namong the relatively well off. We must try to understand\r\nand come to terms with the broader deprivations of our time\r\nthat give rise to the drug abuse problem in the different\r\nstrata of society. Above all we must emphasize the\r\nimportant and central role of drug awareness education.\r\nThis education needs to take place in the home as well as in\r\nthe school and, I believe, it must begin at a very early age\r\nif we are to enable children to resist the pressures of peer\r\ngroups and be alert to the dangers which are facing them.\r\nWe must pay attention to the problems of drugs and crime\r\nand the relationship between them. We must look at all\r\ntimes to the relevance and efficacy of programmes for the\r\nrehabilitation of drug abusers.\r\nHowever, while we must tackle the problems caused by\r\nconsumption in our societies, we must also tackle the root\r\ncause of the problems. To do this we must tackle the\r\nproblems of drug trafficking and drug pushing. We can\r\nsucceed in this area only through ensuring effective\r\ncoordination and cooperation between our law enforcement\r\nagencies and between our criminal justice systems. In this\r\nendeavour the United Nations has an important role to play\r\nin helping to bring about the best possible conditions to\r\nenable this cooperation to exist on a broad international\r\nscale. Within Europe we are seeking to improve this\r\ncoordination and cooperation through the establishment of\r\nEUROPOL. We must never lose sight of the fact that we\r\nare engaged in a battle against organizations which operate\r\non a multinational basis and which have huge financial\r\nresources. The structure of these organizations, and in\r\nparticular their ability to launder money in major money\r\nmarkets, needs to be tackled comprehensively.\r\nAs I said at the beginning of my intervention, we are\r\nfacing up to a global problem which threatens the very\r\nfabric of our society. In this endeavour, unless we pool our\r\ninformation, our technology, our research, our understanding\r\nand our resources to deal with it effectively, we may stand\r\nguilty of leaving a pernicious heritage to generations yet\r\nunborn. Despite the obstacles we may encounter, we can\r\nnever afford to give up the fight. A huge burden has been\r\nplaced upon us and we must, each of us, find the courage\r\nand the strength to challenge it and to win.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Brigadier General\r\nBenny Arad, Executive Director of the Anti-Drug Authority\r\nof Israel.\r\nMr. ARAD (Israel): On behalf of my delegation, I have\r\nthe honour of addressing the General Assembly on a topic\r\nthat unites us all: the global fight against drug abuse.\r\nDuring the last decade, narcotics consumption has\r\nbecome one of the most serious threats against our society,\r\nendangering our most valuable national resources: our\r\ncommunity members and our youth.\r\nIsrael’s drug-fighting policy, like that of many\r\ncountries, strives to balance the vast demands of the struggle\r\nwith the limited resources of the national budget. In spite of\r\nrestricted resources, efforts are being made to address the\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsocial issues confronting Israeli society, amongst them the\r\ndrug problem.\r\nThe Anti-Drug Authority (ADA), as the national bureau\r\nfor planning, coordination and promotion of activities, deals\r\nwith a subject of an interdisciplinary nature, while our main\r\nfocus is on reduction of drug supply and demand. The\r\nAuthority’s mandate includes formulating comprehensive\r\nnationwide policies in all areas of the fight against drug\r\nabuse and promoting and expanding the network of\r\nintervention services in the various areas of this battle.\r\nThese are coupled through the coordination of all the efforts\r\nof Israel’s governmental, non-governmental and public\r\nagencies in the campaign against drug abuse.\r\nDuring the period of its existence, the ADA has\r\nformulated a national strategy against drug abuse based on\r\nbroad interministerial coordination and cooperation.\r\nIsrael, through the ADA, has invested great efforts in\r\nthe improvement of interdiction methods along the borders\r\nand at the points of passage along them. The ADA is\r\npromoting the application of more severe sentences for drug\r\noffenders and especially drug dealers. There is also an\r\nincrease in the number of prosecutions of such offenders.\r\nPrevention programmes are already conducted in a growing\r\nnumber of schools, and the intention is to reach all schools\r\nand all grades in the future. Many activities have been\r\ninitiated and implemented in the field of public education.\r\nThe treatment and rehabilitation infrastructure has been\r\nimproved. Research on drug abuse problems is encouraged,\r\nand many academic programmes for the training of skilled\r\npersonnel to combat all aspects of drug abuse are under way.\r\nDespite Israel’s limited resources, the ADA, under clear\r\ninstructions from the Prime Minister, continues tirelessly to\r\nwage the war against illicit drugs, and in this spirit, the\r\nGovernment of Israel has each year since 1989 increased its\r\nbudget allocation for ADA’s activities.\r\nThe need to fight the drug menace is haunting Israel as\r\nwell as many other countries. Prevention, treatment and law\r\nenforcement all require not only great efforts but also huge\r\nresources. The drug users and hard-core addicts need the\r\nright combination of facilities, treatment, rehabilitation and\r\nother resources that it is our duty to provide.\r\nIsrael is located in a region known as a centre of world\r\ndrug trafficking. Indeed, there is no production of illegal\r\ndrugs of any kind in Israel itself. However, in our part of\r\nthe world, the intensive drug activities along our borders,\r\ntogether with drugs imported to Israel from other countries,\r\npose a tremendous threat to the fabric of our society.\r\nWhile the prime responsibility in fighting illicit drugs\r\nlies with each State, it is also a point of departure for\r\nbinational, regional and multinational cooperation. The\r\nunique balance of strength and weaknesses that exists in\r\neach country’s war on drugs correlates with the adequacy of\r\nits national policies and programmes in the functional\r\ndisciplines of treatment, prevention, law enforcement and\r\ninterdiction. These elements, which lend themselves to the\r\nposition of contributor or beneficiary on the international\r\nlevel, are interrelated with decisions taken by the United\r\nNations and thus catalyse the work of development and\r\nprogress in terms of global cooperation and striking a\r\nbalance in the allocation of resources.\r\nIsrael is ready to cooperate with every nation in its\r\nregion and outside it in the fight against narcotics and other\r\ndrugs. Such cooperation is especially vital considering that\r\nIsrael and its neighbouring countries are situated so closely\r\nto the drug- production centres and their smuggling routes.\r\nIsrael and its neighbours are being used not only as drug-\r\ntransit countries, but also as drug-trade and\r\nlocal-consumption targets.\r\nAs the prospects for peace in the Middle East grow, we\r\nhave to remember that peace is made not only between\r\nGovernments but also between people. The time has come\r\nto establish lasting cooperation and information exchange\r\nlinks between neighbouring countries in every aspect of drug\r\nwarfare, along with frequent exchanges of operational\r\ninformation leading to successful drug interdiction by\r\nrespective drug-enforcement entities.\r\nWe call on our neighbours and the world community to\r\nunite with us in the campaign against narcotic drugs as part\r\nof the efforts to promote peace in our region and all over the\r\nworld. We urge our neighbours to establish a regional\r\ncommittee, open to all countries of the Middle East region,\r\nto combine resources, efforts and expertise and present a\r\nunified front against drug abuse and its implications.\r\nIsrael is eager to participate in the implementation of\r\nprogrammes that will reduce demand and inhibit the supply\r\nof narcotic drugs. Only by combining and coordinating our\r\nefforts can we create the conditions essential to eradicating\r\nthis global scourge. It is our responsibility to reduce the\r\nseverity of this plague, which crosses all national boundaries,\r\nand the untold suffering it causes.\r\nWe share the view that drug enforcement alone cannot\r\nprovide the ultimate solution to the drug problem. However,\r\nalong with other long-term measures for demand reduction,\r\ndrug-law enforcement through effective interdiction will play\r\na key role in the immediate, short- and medium-term drug\r\nwarfare as long as disruption of the drug-trafficking routes\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 23\r\nremains a major means of cutting down the supply of drugs.\r\nIsrael is a party to the Single Convention on Narcotic\r\nDrugs of 1961 and its amendment. Israel is also a party to\r\nthe Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. We\r\nhave taken all the necessary steps to implement these\r\nConventions. We are also proceeding to amend our\r\ndomestic legislation to ratify the 1988 Convention as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nThe State of Israel has made sincere efforts to establish\r\ninternational cooperation on a binational as well as a\r\nmultinational level. Since 1991 we have signed a\r\nMemorandum of Understanding and agreements of\r\ncooperation with the United States of America, France and\r\nChile. We are trying to activate an existing agreement with\r\nItaly. Likewise, we hope to promote such agreements with\r\nother countries to stimulate binational cooperation and\r\nexchange of information on methods against drug abuse.\r\nIsrael invites the international community to share the\r\nknowledge it has accumulated in all the domains of the fight\r\nagainst drugs.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations should adopt a\r\nstricter approach to the use of heroin, which is the main\r\ndrug threat in most countries. We encourage the\r\nestablishment of a central data system in each country to\r\nkeep track of intervention methods and list individuals who\r\nare known as drug users or offenders. In addition, we\r\nrecommend the establishment of an international information\r\ncentre for exchanging information on intervention methods\r\nthat are applied in the various aspects of fighting drug abuse.\r\nSince ADA’s establishment, we have cooperated with\r\nthe United Nations drug-fighting bodies and taken all the\r\nnecessary steps to achieve the drug-fighting goals set by the\r\nUnited Nations. Since 1990, representatives of the United\r\nNations programmes - starting with the former Director of\r\nthe United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control and the\r\nPresident and representatives of the International Narcotics\r\nControl Board - have visited Israel and gained first-hand\r\nknowledge of our commitment to preventing and fighting\r\ndrug addiction and trafficking. These representatives had the\r\nopportunity to see at first-hand the drug-fighting scene in\r\nIsrael and to learn about our methods and special\r\nprogrammes. They were impressed by Israel’s intervention\r\nprogrammes and the high quality of our professionals. We\r\nare looking forward to establishing mutual working relations\r\nwith the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme and to giving professional assistance to other\r\nnations.\r\nThe Government of Israel wishes to stress its total and\r\nunwavering commitment to fighting the drug scourge and to\r\nparticipating fully in all international efforts with each and\r\nevery State.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Mrs. Katalen Szomor\r\nMolnar, Executive Secretary of the Interministerial Drug\r\nCommittee of Hungary.\r\nMrs. SZOMOR MOLNAR (Hungary): I am honoured\r\nto participate on behalf of the Government of the Republic\r\nof Hungary in these high-level meetings of the General\r\nAssembly dealing with the global problem of drug abuse and\r\nthe ways and means to enhance the coherence of the\r\nsystem-wide activities in this field.\r\nWe are convinced that implementing a comprehensive\r\nmultidisciplinary strategy at each level of society is the only\r\nway to guarantee success in the worldwide fight against drug\r\nabuse. Also, as has been stated in United Nations forums -\r\nfirst at the International Conference on Drug Abuse and\r\nIllicit Trafficking in 1987 in Vienna - and laid down in the\r\nComprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline, in various\r\nresolutions of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the\r\nGeneral Assembly and, most importantly, in the Global\r\nProgramme of Action, a well-balanced approach to drug\r\ndemand and supply reduction has to be implemented on\r\nglobal, regional, national and local levels.\r\nBecause of the international and highly sophisticated\r\nnature of drug criminality, and also because of the global\r\nnature of the epidemic of drug misuse of our age - well-\r\ncoordinated international control and preventive actions\r\nbased on the policy prepared and approved by the competent\r\nUnited Nations bodies are called for to give guidance to\r\nGovernments in implementing their national drug strategies\r\nand in carrying out a drug policy under the guidelines of the\r\nGlobal Programme of Action.\r\nHungary is party to the 1961 and 1971 United Nations\r\ndrug Conventions and by the end of this year, following the\r\nadoption of the necessary legislative measures, we are going\r\nto ratify the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic\r\nof Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988.\r\nThe Hungarian Government established an Inter-\r\nministerial Drug Committee in 1991, in which the\r\nrepresentatives of 18 ministries and national agencies are\r\ntaking decisions on our drug strategy and coordinating its\r\nimplementation. The Committee is supported by working\r\ngroups whose tasks are the drawing up of draft legislation\r\nand professional guidelines, strategic planning, evaluation of\r\nactivities, and so on, in the areas of precursors,\r\nmoney-laundering, treatment as an alternative to prison,\r\ntreatment in prison, national training plans, national\r\nprevention policies, epidemiology and drug-testing\r\nlaboratories.\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nAs a result of the war in former Yugoslavia, the main\r\ntransit line of the Balkan drug trafficking route is now\r\ntraversing Hungary and my country must cope with the\r\nincreased problems arising there from illegal transit,\r\nincreased illegal marketing, alarming trends of growing drug\r\nabuse and its interaction with the problems of social\r\nmarginalization of larger groups, together with a shift in\r\ndrug using habits from softer to harder drugs, including\r\nabuse of poppy.\r\nAs a country with a well-developed pharmaceutical and\r\nchemical industry, we are striving to prevent diversion of\r\npsychotropic substances and precursors into illegal channels.\r\nOur legislation on precursors, in effect since 1990, now\r\ncovers all the 22 substances.\r\nWe are aware of the importance of preventing money\r\nlaundering by legal means as well as by establishing a\r\nvoluntary reporting system within financial institutions. The\r\nrelevant legislation is to be taken up by the Parliament at the\r\nend of this year.\r\nA newly emerging problem in our region is the\r\nadvocacy of the so-called advantages of legalizing soft, and\r\nhard, drugs. Radical groups are trying to get the support of\r\nthe mass media to achieve this objective. This problem\r\nwould require a more active involvement by the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) in\r\norder to counter these negative tendencies.\r\nThe Government of Hungary has responded to these\r\nchallenges by establishing the necessary institutional\r\narrangements. The national police have established a crime\r\nand drug prevention network on national and county levels,\r\nand the public health service has national, county and city\r\nlevel medical officers who deal with the various aspects of\r\nthe drug problem. We have 130 health education institutions\r\ndisseminating information on the dangers of substance abuse.\r\nHungary has already taken innovative steps to establish\r\na well-functioning system of multisectoral national and\r\ncounty level bodies entrusted with organizing prevention\r\nactivities.\r\nThese steps show that we have done a lot, nationally,\r\nto prevent any aggravation of the drug abuse situation. At\r\nthe same time, we should like to count on continuing\r\nguidance and support from UNDCP and from other\r\nmultisectoral international organizations, such as, for\r\nexample, the Pompidou Group.\r\nWe encourage UNDCP to continue its efforts to\r\nharmonize the various levels of international cooperation\r\nagainst drug abuse in order to allow for the maximum use of\r\nresources and eliminate overlap and duplication of efforts.\r\nWe fully support the demand reduction resolution from\r\nthe Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its thirty-sixth session\r\ninviting international organizations, governments and\r\nnon-governmental organizations to formulate strategies in the\r\ndrug demand reduction field through defining target groups\r\nand developing special prevention programmes adapted to\r\nlocal social and cultural environments, to develop expertise\r\nthrough training and also to outline damage reduction\r\nprogrammes and programmes to prevent the spread of\r\nhuman immunodeficiency virus epidemics.\r\nIn the light of the global importance of demand\r\nreduction, UNDCP should further develop its research\r\nactivities with a view to providing Governments with\r\nprimary prevention programmes that have undergone\r\nscientific evaluation in UNDCP, thereby minimizing adverse\r\neffects.\r\nHungary, after 25 years of membership in the\r\nCommission on Narcotic Drugs, is fully aware of the\r\nimportance of well-balanced supply and demand reduction\r\npolicies and the need for innovative approaches and adequate\r\nfunding in the primary prevention field, and fully supports\r\nthe leading and coordinating role of UNDCP in the\r\nworld-wide action against drug abuse. We are ready to\r\ncontribute our share to our common endeavours in this\r\nimportant area.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on Mr. Devi Prasad\r\nOjha, Member of Parliament of Nepal.\r\nMr. OJHA (Nepal): The menace of drug trafficking\r\nand abuse has emerged as a major challenge confronting\r\nmankind. The illicit use of and traffic in narcotics and\r\npsychotropic substances have become a social plague\r\nafflicting both the developed and the developing countries.\r\nThat humanity could be so deeply mired in the commerce of\r\ndegradation and death is indeed a sobering thought.\r\nAs the criminal organizations running this trade have no\r\nrespect for international frontiers, no State on its own is in\r\na position to counter the problem. Concerted actions and\r\ncooperation at the international level are the only weapons\r\nagainst this scourge.\r\nIt is now commonly agreed that the one law the drug\r\ntraffickers do not break is the law of supply and demand.\r\nSo long as there is demand for substances and the money to\r\npay for them, the traffickers will find a way of meeting that\r\ndemand. The war against drugs will be won or lost on the\r\nability of the international community to restrict the supply\r\nand at the same time reduce demand for narcotic drugs.\r\nThe global menace of drugs calls for a global response,\r\nand the United Nations offers the best forum for this kind of\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 25\r\ncoordinated action. An effective international response\r\nwould depend a great deal on close coordination and reliable\r\nfunding of the multidisciplinary programme of action. What\r\nis required is more extensive cooperation between national\r\nlaw enforcement agencies in interdiction and narcotic\r\nintelligence.\r\nThere is also an urgent need to further strengthen\r\nincentives for the cultivation of substitute crops within the\r\nframework of a comprehensive rural development\r\nprogramme. Assurances of a steady market for substitute\r\nproducts are an essential step towards reducing the illicit\r\nproduction of raw materials. A global programme also\r\ncannot overlook the social and humanitarian aspects of the\r\nproblem.\r\nThe adoption in 1990 by General Assembly at its\r\nseventeenth special session of the Political Declaration and\r\nGlobal Programme of Action reflects the determination of\r\nthe international community to coordinate its efforts in the\r\nfight against drugs. The declaration of the 1990s as the\r\nUnited Nations Decade against Drug Abuse has given\r\nexpression to the sense of urgency within a time-frame for\r\naction. This has led to an intensification of actions at the\r\nnational and inter-State levels.\r\nAlthough the problem of drugs has not reached\r\nepidemic proportions in Nepal, we have initiated a series of\r\nmeasures in keeping with the Global Programme of Action.\r\nAt the apex is the coordination committee under the\r\nchairmanship of the Home Minister. A master plan has been\r\nformulated with the assistance of UNDCP.\r\nWithin our resource constraints, we have been giving\r\nincreasing emphasis to treatment, rehabilitation and\r\nreintegration of drug offenders and abusers. Increasing\r\nattention is being given to education and public information\r\ncampaigns to generate awareness among the masses. We are\r\ntrying to establish a nationwide network aimed at mobilizing\r\nbasic community-level forces and the private sector in the\r\nfight against drugs. There is an active campaign to interdict\r\ntrafficking in illicit drugs and to counter their production.\r\nTo this end, the Government’s enforcement department is\r\nbeing steadily strengthened.\r\nAt the regional level, we are active partners with other\r\nmembers of the South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation (SAARC) in pursuing drug-control activities.\r\nSAARC has already carried out several major programmes\r\ninvolving policy makers, law enforcement agencies and\r\nprofessionals in the field of demand reduction. We now\r\nhave in our region a SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs\r\nand Psychotropic Substances, which will help us coordinate\r\nour efforts in this area at the regional level.\r\nOver the past four decades, the United Nations has\r\ntaken important steps in the fight against drugs at the\r\ninternational level. The Single Convention on Narcotic\r\nDrugs of 1961, its 1972 Protocol, the 1971 Convention on\r\nPsychotropic Substances and the United Nations Convention\r\nagainst Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\r\nSubstances of 1988 constitute a comprehensive system of\r\ninternational control and a framework for cooperation against\r\ntrafficking.\r\nThe United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP) is the single drug control programme,\r\ncreated by the General Assembly in 1990. Lack of adequate\r\nfinancial and human resources and administrative bottlenecks\r\nshould not be allowed to hamper the mandate of that\r\nimportant Programme. The General Assembly has to ensure\r\nthat the resources allocated to the Programme are\r\ncommensurate with the heavy demands on it. In that\r\ncontext, I wish to refer to the valuable assistance provided\r\nby UNDCP in our national drug-control efforts. We also\r\ncommend the quality of the workshops and expert-group\r\nmeetings held under the auspices of the UNDCP within the\r\nframework of the Decade against Drug Abuse. My\r\ndelegation urges greater efforts by the agencies of the United\r\nNations system to incorporate and coordinate drug-related\r\nactivities in their programmes, in keeping with the\r\nSystem-wide Action Plan on Drug Abuse Control.\r\nThe war against drugs is one that mankind cannot lose.\r\nMy delegation hopes that the review of the implementation\r\nof the Global Programme of Action at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will intensify international cooperation to\r\nend this nightmare.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call next on the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Alounkeo Kittikhoun.\r\nMr. KITTIKHOUN (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic) (interpretation from French): The convening of\r\nhigh-level plenary meetings to examine the status of\r\ninternational cooperation against the illicit production, sale,\r\ndemand, traffic and distribution of narcotics and\r\npsychotropic substances is a clear reflection of how seriously\r\nthe international community is approaching this important\r\nquestion. My delegation welcomes these plenary meetings,\r\nand hopes they will give new impetus to international\r\ncooperation in this sphere.\r\nDespite vigorous efforts by countries at the local,\r\nregional, bilateral and multilateral levels, and despite certain\r\nencouraging developments, the overall world situation with\r\nrespect to drug abuse and illicit trafficking continues to\r\ndeteriorate. Unfortunately, there is no sign that this alarming\r\nsituation will improve in the near future. In conformity with\r\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe Declaration and the United Nations System-Wide Action\r\nPlan on Drug Abuse Control adopted by the International\r\nConference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, and with\r\nthe Political Declaration and the Global Programme of\r\nAction adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth\r\nspecial session - all of which remain fully valid - the\r\ninternational community is called upon to take the necessary\r\nmeasures and to do everything possible to eliminate the\r\nscourge of drug abuse and illicit trafficking. It is in the\r\ninterest of countries throughout the world, producers and\r\nconsumers alike, to work together in this difficult struggle,\r\nfor without effective, sincere cooperation, we are all doomed\r\nto be the losers. And if we all lose the battle, the big\r\nwinners will be the traffickers.\r\nThe fight against drug abuse and illicit trafficking is a\r\ndifficult and complex undertaking. We think it must be\r\nwaged in strict conformity with the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and international law, in particular those\r\nregarding respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity\r\nof States and the inadmissibility of the threat or use of force\r\nin international relations. These are sacrosanct principles\r\njealously defended by our peoples; they must be observed\r\nwhen we promote international cooperation in this sphere.\r\nLike many other countries, the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic knows the disastrous consequences of drug abuse.\r\nWe all understand the scope of the problem and that we\r\nmust do everything to fight this scourge. Proceeding from\r\nthat premise, my country took the important decision to\r\naccede to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961\r\nand has participated in international conferences, seminars\r\nand forums on the problem of drug abuse, all in the hope of\r\nmaking our modest contribution to the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to eradicate this problem. We note\r\nthe complexity of the 1988 Vienna Convention against Illicit\r\nTraffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances; it\r\ninvolves a number of obligations requiring thorough analysis.\r\nSerious consideration of the Convention by the competent\r\nauthorities is under way in my country.\r\nIn 1990 we established a national commission for\r\ncontrol and monitoring of drugs under the chairmanship of\r\na Vice-Minister. It is an independent body with the\r\ninvolvement of several relevant ministries; its permanent\r\nsecretariat is at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Its main\r\ntask is to coordinate all activities relating to drugs. It\r\ninitiates programmes, plans new activities, follows up\r\nongoing operations and collects data on production, traffic\r\nand abuse of drugs. The commission is still in its youth and\r\nneeds international assistance in many areas if it is to be\r\nable to shoulder its weighty responsibilities.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic is one of the\r\nSouth-East Asian opium-producing countries. One of our\r\nethnic minorities, the Hmongs, has cultivated opium for\r\ngenerations. In order to reduce opium production the Lao\r\nGovernment currently has four integrated rural development\r\nprojects under way. Three of these projects receive technical\r\nassistance from the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme (UNDCP) and financial contributions in\r\nthe form of grants from Germany, Japan, Norway and\r\nSweden. Just as important, the International Fund for\r\nAgricultural Development (IFAD) contributes with loans on\r\nconcessional terms. The fourth project is entirely financed\r\nby the United States of America. On behalf of the Lao\r\nGovernment and people I should like to take this opportunity\r\nto express our most sincere thanks to UNDCP, IFAD and the\r\nGovernments of those friendly countries for their important\r\nassistance.\r\nThe main objective of these development projects is to\r\noffer opium producers viable alternatives on the economic,\r\nsocial and ecological levels. We are pleased that the results\r\nare fairly encouraging so far. A large number of Hmong\r\nvillagers have voluntarily abandoned the growing of opium.\r\nThese development projects have given them hope in their\r\nefforts to raise their standard of living, and many of them\r\nfeel that their way of life now is much better than it has\r\nbeen for several generations. The report (A/48/286) of the\r\nSecretary-General on the implementation by Member States\r\nof the Global Programme of Action, recognizes that opium\r\nproduction in Laos has fallen considerably. Similarly, the\r\nUnited States State Department said in a 1993 report:\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n\"Laos, the world’s third largest opium-producing\r\ncountry, is the only one of the top three to reduce its\r\npotential opium production in each of the past three\r\nyears (estimated production declined 13 percent in 1992\r\nfrom 1991)\".\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn this fight against drug abuse the Lao Government\r\nalso emphasises suppression. In 1992, 77 people in\r\npossession of cannabis, heroin and opium were arrested and\r\nprosecuted under the law. In 1993, the number was 99. We\r\nintend to continue our efforts resolutely so that we can make\r\nour modest contribution to international cooperation in this\r\narea. At the regional level the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic attaches great importance to its cooperation with\r\nthe People’s Republic of China, the Kingdom of Thailand\r\nand Myanmar, with assistance from the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme. The Memorandum\r\nof Understanding which we have just signed here in New\r\nYork with our partners, the People’s Republic of China,\r\nThailand, Myanmar and the UNDCP, offers an important\r\nframework for effective cooperation in the future. With firm\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 27\r\nresolve and with multifaceted and sincere cooperation we\r\nhope to be able to attain our objectives.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nBenin.\r\nMr. KPAKPO (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nAs the Secretary-General has emphasized in his message on\r\nthe occasion of these two days of special debate, drug abuse\r\nand illicit trafficking in drugs have become a real scourge,\r\nwhich is constantly expanding.\r\nThe very large number of speakers on this subject\r\nshows the constant concern felt by the international\r\ncommunity in the face of the disaster that drugs represent for\r\nour societies. The unanimous determination to fight such a\r\ndisaster is a source of encouragement for our delegation.\r\nIn Africa the drug phenomenon, which has been\r\nsteadily growing worse since the 1980s, constitutes an\r\nadditional social problem for a number of countries already\r\ntormented by so many ills. Indeed, the African continent\r\nhas become the very crossroads for illicit drug trafficking of\r\nall kinds because of the extremely limited material and\r\nfinancial resources available to our countries to fight this\r\nphenomenon.\r\nThe devastating consequences of drug abuse and the\r\nillicit trafficking in drugs are everywhere the same:\r\nincreased crime, more violence, more juvenile delinquency\r\nand a worsening social situation in general. That is why the\r\nongoing debate is particularly important to us.\r\nMrs. Hassan (Egypt), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meetings devoted to the matter give the\r\ninternational community an opportunity to reaffirm the\r\npriority it attaches to the problem of controlling narcotic\r\ndrugs.\r\nAt its seventeenth special session the General Assembly\r\nadopted on 23 February 1990 resolution S-17/2, containing\r\na Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action in\r\nwhich it spells out its objectives and the measures to attain\r\nthem. The General Assembly also proclaimed the period\r\n1991-2000 the United Nations Decade against Drug Abuse.\r\nIn this connection Benin congratulates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the major report he has submitted on the\r\nimplementation by Member States of the Global Programme\r\nof Action, and gives its support to the recommendations in\r\nit.\r\nIt is important to note that, in pursuit of the goals of the\r\nGlobal Programme of Action, the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) was\r\nestablished in 1990. It is only right to emphasize here the\r\nvery positive contribution that that Programme has made at\r\nthe national level as it seeks to help the developing countries\r\nin particular to build up their ability to fight drug abuse and\r\nillicit trafficking in narcotic drugs.\r\nWe are happy to note that progress has already been\r\nmade, particularly in West Africa, Central Africa and East\r\nAfrica, in consolidating the regional cooperation that is\r\nnecessary so that collectively we can cope with the scourge\r\nof drugs in Africa.\r\nTo help developing countries meet their obligations, the\r\nUnited Nations must give more priority to technical\r\ncooperation in monitoring, preventing and reducing drug\r\naddiction so as to eliminate the still growing illicit demand\r\nfor narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.\r\nWe shall be able to put an end to drug abuse and the\r\ncrime it causes only by prevention efforts based on\r\ninformation, education and action campaigns.\r\nMember States should encourage the executive bodies\r\nof the specialized agencies of the United Nations to attach\r\ngreater priority to their drug control activities. Such priority\r\nwill have to be backed by allocations of additional resources\r\nto these bodies, particularly the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme.\r\nAt another level, the measures aimed at controlling\r\nnarcotic drugs adopted by the international community\r\ncannot be successful unless all States parties abide\r\nscrupulously by the provisions of international treaties\r\nregulating the growing, producing, manufacturing, trading\r\nand use of narcotic drugs. That is why Benin, which has\r\nalready ratified the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of\r\n1961 and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances,\r\nis taking further steps to accede to the United Nations\r\nConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\r\nPsychotropic Substances of 1988. These international\r\nConventions represent basic legal instruments which each\r\ncountry must draw upon in drafting its own national\r\nlegislation.\r\nIn conclusion, I repeat that the delegation of Benin is\r\ndeeply convinced that only the adoption of effective and\r\nsustained measures at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels to promote the implementation of the Global\r\nProgramme of Action will allow us to win the fight against\r\ndrug abuse and the illicit trafficking in drugs. We hope to\r\nsee our deliberations result in a strengthening of the\r\ninternational community’s determination to wage a fierce\r\nstruggle against one of the most disastrous scourges\r\nhumanity has ever faced.\r\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Arabic): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Lebanon.\r\nMr. MAKKAWI (Lebanon) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): Drug abuse is a grave scourge that afflicts all\r\nhuman societies. It has had serious adverse effects on the\r\nsocial and economic life of large groups of people.\r\nCombating that scourge has required and continues to\r\nrequire concerted action by all nations and by international\r\norganizations. The United Nations has played a crucial role\r\nin the development of a global strategy against this growing\r\nmenace.\r\nRecognizing the magnitude of this threat and assuming\r\nits responsibilities towards the world community, Lebanon\r\nhas spared no effort, even during the darkest days of the\r\nbloody years of the strife that devastated its territory, in\r\ntrying to curb the cultivation of narcotic plants and the\r\nprocessing of and trafficking in illicit drugs. To this end, as\r\nthis Assembly is aware, our national efforts have persisted\r\ndespite our extremely limited resources, the decline of the\r\nrule of law and the weakness of governmental organs due to\r\nthe general conditions that prevailed in the country.\r\nFurthermore, Lebanon has continued to be an active member\r\nof the United Nations International Drug Control Programme\r\n(UNDCP) and has maintained close and effective\r\ncooperation with the International Criminal Police\r\nOrganization (Interpol) even throughout that period.\r\nLebanon’s geographical location - at the crossroads\r\nbetween the East and the West, between the centres of illicit\r\ndrug-production and drug-consumption markets - has made\r\nit, on the one hand, a transit route for opium and hashish\r\nsupplies exported to Europe and, on the other, a trade route\r\nfor cocaine shipments originating in Latin America. In\r\naddition, the extremely difficult living conditions of\r\nLebanese farmers and the disruption of licit crop production\r\nand export activity for an extended period of time during the\r\ncivil war, inclined some toward the cultivation of narcotic-\r\ndrug plants. The lure of ready markets was too strong to\r\nresist especially in view of the virtual absence of central\r\ngovernment authority and the weakness of local government\r\nlaw-enforcement agencies.\r\nThe difficult internal security situation afforded drug\r\ntraffickers good opportunities for increasing their production.\r\nThus, the land area used for cultivation of illicit narcotic\r\nplants was expanded to 16,000 hectares in 1987. In\r\naddition, manufacturing facilities were built, trafficking\r\nnetworks were organized and expanded and illegal seaports\r\nwere developed and operated for illicit purposes.\r\nAgainst this backdrop the Lebanese Government,\r\nfollowing the re-establishment of its authority through the\r\nTaif national reconciliation pact, made it one of its top\r\npriorities to launch a firm and relentless drive against all\r\naspects of illicit drug activity: cultivation, production,\r\ndistribution and trafficking.\r\nOver the past three years, all fields of narcotic-drug\r\nplants in the Beka’a Valley have been eradicated. In fact,\r\nthe last two hectares of such plants, grown in rugged terrain,\r\nwere destroyed this year. The fact that Lebanon is now\r\ntotally free of such plantings is cause for celebration and a\r\nsource of pride. I repeat: Lebanon today is totally free of\r\nsuch plantings. Thanks to the combined efforts of the\r\nLebanese Internal Security Forces, the army and the customs\r\nservice, sizeable amounts of narcotic drugs have been seized\r\nand large numbers of traffickers have been arrested. The\r\nfollowing figures are quite illustrative: in 1990 588\r\nkilograms of hashish were seized, along with 33 kilograms\r\nof heroin and 17 kilograms of cocaine. In addition, 372\r\ntraffickers were arrested. In 1993, on the other hand, up to\r\n30 September, some 13,700 kilograms of hashish had been\r\nseized, along with 45 kilograms of heroin and 263 kilograms\r\nof cocaine, while 858 traffickers had been arrested.\r\nThe Drug Control Division of the Judiciary Police has\r\nbeen reinforced with officers and equipment, and four new\r\nbranch offices have been added in major cities, despite our\r\nscarce resources. Also, all illegal seaports that were used for\r\ndrug smuggling have been destroyed.\r\nThe Lebanese drug-control and law-enforcement\r\nagencies have maintained extensive and close cooperation\r\nwith their counterparts in Europe and the United States. The\r\nwide scope of cooperation, which included 30 operations of\r\ncontrolled delivery under surveillance has yielded remarkable\r\nresults. Several international smugglers and traffickers have\r\nbeen arrested and their clandestine operational networks\r\ndismantled. Considerable amounts of narcotic drugs have\r\nalso been seized.\r\nThe Lebanese Government pursues a very stringent\r\npolicy towards those who farm and traffic in drug plants.\r\nTo a large extent, it has succeeded in eliminating the\r\ndomestic distribution networks which constitute, as in other\r\ncountries, the most formidable of the global strata of\r\nproduction, shipment and consumption of illicit drugs. At\r\nthe same time, the Lebanese Government is in the process\r\nof enacting new legislation to stiffen punishment of those\r\nconvicted of drug-related crimes. A High Inter-Ministerial\r\nCommittee, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, has been\r\nset up to develop and define the general policy parameters\r\nof combating drugs.\r\nThe international missions which recently visited\r\nLebanon have expressed satisfaction over the efforts made\r\nby the Lebanese Government to combat illicit drugs and the\r\neffectiveness of the measures it has taken in this regard.\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 29\r\nThe international observers have also verified that, as a\r\nresult of the Government’s policy of eliminating illicit\r\nplantings,\r\n\"some 500,000 Lebanese civilians living in 240\r\nvillages in the north-eastern Beka’a region, who up to\r\nthat point had relied on opium and hashish for their\r\nlivelihoods, are now forced to seek new and alternative\r\nmeans of earning a living.\"\r\nLebanon has emerged from its long, painful plight with\r\na devastated infrastructure and severely disrupted basic civil\r\nservices. The Lebanese administration is seriously hampered\r\nby enormous shortages in its operational resources, with\r\nnegative implications for the operational functions of the\r\npolice and security apparatus, including the drug-control\r\nmachinery. In sharp contrast, drug traffickers and smugglers\r\nhave access to state-of-the-art technology, which they exploit\r\nin expanding their illicit activities and transactions.\r\nLebanon has duly sought to discharge its obligations in\r\nthe area of combating the illicit cultivation, manufacture and\r\ntrafficking of narcotic drugs. Therefore, it expects to receive\r\nfrom the Governments of friendly countries, especially those\r\nwhose societies suffer from widespread drug-related\r\nproblems, material and technical assistance towards the\r\ndevelopment of a substitute economy in the Lebanese areas\r\nwhich, for many years, have depended on narcotic drugs as\r\na major economic and financial source of revenue. The\r\nLebanese Government is in need of external aid for its\r\ndevelopment projects in remote areas and for the creation of\r\nsubstitute crops that would ensure adequate and licit\r\nlivelihoods for the farmers, with a view to discouraging them\r\nfrom engaging in illicit cultivation. We also hope that the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies will make\r\neffective contributions towards that goal.\r\nI take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Executive\r\nDirector of the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme, Mr. Giacomelli, for the interest he has shown\r\nin the needs of Lebanon. In this context, may I draw\r\nattention to the fact that Lebanon’s share of the United\r\nNations offerings in this area has been limited to a single\r\nmultifaceted programme whose value did not exceed\r\n$1,129,000. We sincerely hope that future assistance to\r\nLebanon will be commensurate with its actual and urgent\r\nneeds.\r\nThe concepts of global interdependence and solidarity\r\nshould unite us in our common struggle against this scourge,\r\nwherever it appears and in all its aspects. However, we feel\r\nthat confronting this problem in its first stage, namely the\r\nstage of cultivation of narcotic plants, is perhaps the most\r\ncost-effective method. A \"nip it in the bud\" approach would\r\nbe most appropriate in dealing with this scourge.\r\nFurthermore, Lebanon is in need of assistance to\r\nestablish clinical facilities and counselling programmes to\r\ntreat and rehabilitate the victims of this serious social\r\nproblem. In this context, Lebanon is now seeking to\r\nestablish, with the cooperation of the Arab Ministers of the\r\nInterior, a pan-Arab rehabilitation centre in Lebanon to treat\r\ndrug addicts from Arab and Middle Eastern countries.\r\nLebanon, which has traditionally played a leading role\r\nin the cultural and economic life of the entire region,\r\ncontinues to have the potential and fervent desire to maintain\r\nits creative and pioneering role in its immediate region and\r\nin the world at large. However, under the present\r\ncircumstances, Lebanon is in need of support and assistance\r\nfrom friendly Governments and international organizations\r\nin order to help the Government enhance its effectiveness\r\nand carry out reconstruction and development programmes\r\nthroughout the country. Our current economic and social\r\nplans focus on the development of our human resources and\r\nthe revitalization of our national institutions.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on The Honourable\r\nPhandu Skelemani, Attorney-General of Botswana.\r\nMr. SKELEMANI (Botswana): By now, we all know\r\nthat the problem of the illicit production, sale, demand and\r\ndistribution of narcotics and psychotropic substances has\r\nbeen with us for a very, very long time. The nations of the\r\nworld have individually, regionally and internationally tried\r\nto grapple with this problem, with varying degrees of\r\nsuccess. There is no doubt in my mind that, in order to\r\nachieve any reasonable measure of success in the war\r\nagainst drug abuse and drug trafficking, greater practical\r\ninternational cooperation is necessary.\r\nI am sure that by now we have all realized that,\r\nalthough it is necessary to bring the nations of the world\r\ntogether every now and then and to sign treaties, meaningful\r\nprogress can be achieved only when individual States do all\r\nwithin their power to help each other.\r\nThe causes of illicit drug trafficking are many and\r\nvaried. Poverty, greed and decadence are, in my view, some\r\nof the primary causes. It therefore appears to me that we\r\nshould pay greater attention to the identification of the\r\ncauses of illicit drug trafficking, because it is only when we\r\nclearly understand why our people engage in illicit drug\r\ntrafficking that we can come up with solutions likely to have\r\nan impact. If there is no crop substitution for a peasant who\r\ngrows as a lucrative cash crop plants from which drugs are\r\nmade, what hope is there of dissuading that peasant from\r\ngrowing such plants?\r\nI am aware that resolution 47/99 of 16 December 1992\r\ncalls for introspection. I also believe that the actions we\r\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ntake in the fight against illicit drug trafficking will invariably\r\nreflect our perception of what the root causes of the problem\r\nare. Consequently, Botswana, although it has not yet acceded\r\nto the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic\r\nin Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, has taken\r\nwhat we consider to be the primary practical steps necessary\r\nfor the implementation of that Convention, among others.\r\nIn 1990, Botswana enacted the Mutual Assistance in\r\nCriminal Matters Act. As that Act states, its object is to\r\nfacilitate the provision, and obtaining by Botswana, of\r\ninternational assistance in criminal matters. Under this Act,\r\nwe are able to help other countries to obtain evidence,\r\nidentify witnesses and suspects in Botswana. We can\r\nexecute requests for search and seizure and confiscation of\r\nproperty in respect of offences. Thus we have enabled\r\nourselves to make the necessary applications to our courts on\r\nbehalf of other States or authorities. The State also has the\r\npower to send to other States persons required as witnesses,\r\neven if such persons are prisoners, as long as the usual\r\nsafeguards are given by the other State.\r\nWe have also enacted the Proceeds of Serious Crime Act\r\n1990, which also allows the State where a person has been\r\nconvicted of a serious crime to apply to court for a\r\nconfiscation order in respect of proceeds of that crime. A\r\nserious crime is an offence punishable by not less than two\r\nyears’ imprisonment. This definition does not apply in the\r\ncase of the enforcement of a foreign confiscation order,\r\nwhich, I might add, will be enforced whatever the minimum\r\npunishment in the other country. This Act also allows us to\r\napply for a restraining order - ex parte - to ensure that the\r\nprobable proceeds of serious crime are not dissipated before\r\na trial is concluded.\r\nThe aim of those pieces of legislation is to ensure that\r\ndrug traffickers, among others, do not benefit from their\r\ncriminal activities. They should know that their ill-gotten\r\ngains will not be safe in Botswana, as the legal framework\r\nnow exists which allows for such gains to be followed and\r\nconfiscated.\r\nAlthough Botswana is not a producer of any of the\r\nillicit narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, save a\r\nsmall amount of marijuana - or dagga - we have\r\nnevertheless deemed it necessary to punish severely those\r\nwho traffic in those substances. Even though as a lawyer\r\none does not want the executive to dictate to the courts what\r\npunishment to give in any given case, we have had to\r\nprovide for minimum sentences of 10 years’ imprisonment\r\nfor traffickers. This minimum sentence has obviously had\r\nsome effect, as the number of persons caught with illicit\r\ndrugs has dropped significantly.\r\nI should also mention our 1990 Extradition Act. Such\r\nlaws, we believe, are important in any international fight\r\nagainst drug traffickers. On the basis of reciprocity, we are\r\nwilling to extradite even our nationals for trial or sentencing\r\noutside our jurisdiction. There are very few exceptions to extradition -\r\nand these are universally accepted - such as that the offence\r\nis punishable by death in the other country whereas it is not\r\nso punishable in Botswana. But the accused may still be\r\nextradited if agreement is reached that the death penalty will\r\nnot be imposed.\r\nLet me turn finally to those areas where it is not within\r\nour power to legislate or easily find an effective solution. A\r\nfew of our nationals have as a result of either poverty or greed -\r\nor both - become involved in illicit trafficking in habit-\r\nforming drugs. We have tried and continue to try to\r\naccelerate rural development. We have received help from\r\nmany of our friends through bilateral arrangements and,\r\nindeed, from the United Nations. A lot remains to be done\r\nand a lot can be achieved only through international\r\ncooperation.\r\nPractical cooperation between investigating and\r\nprosecuting agencies can be improved. We have to realize\r\nthat it is not much use catching only the small fish: it is the\r\ndrug barons we must aim for. We need stricter legislation\r\non both corruption and money-laundering. Banks should not\r\nsimply accept unexplained huge deposits. Greater access to\r\nbanking records should be possible. Indeed, people ought to\r\nbe required to explain life styles beyond their known\r\nlegitimate means. I am pleased to say that we in Botswana\r\nare busy preparing legislation to deal with this kind of\r\ncorruption.\r\nThe success of small jurisdictions like ours will depend\r\nto a very large extent on the help we can get from the\r\ninternational community. Our law enforcement agencies\r\nneed greater training. For example, we need police\r\naccountants to go through the accounts of suspects. We\r\nneed help also to mount educational programmes against the\r\nevils of drug abuse and the corruption associated therewith.\r\nWe are clearly very far from producing drug-free societies,\r\nand we probably will never be able to achieve a\r\n100 per cent cleansing. Yet we must continue to fight with\r\ngreater vigour, especially in the face of the sophisticated\r\nmethods used by drug traffickers the world over.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Arabic): I call\r\nnext on the Director-General and Chief Executive of the\r\nNational Drug Law Enforcement Agency and Assistant\r\nInspector-General of Police of Nigeria, His Excellency\r\nMr. Bappah Jama’are Muhammad.\r\nMr. MUHAMMAD (Nigeria): My delegation is pleased\r\nto be participating in these high-level meetings to review the\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 31\r\nstatus of international cooperation against the illicit\r\nproduction, sale, demand, traffic and distribution of narcotics\r\nand psychotropic substances, especially since the adoption of\r\na Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action at\r\nthe seventeenth special session of the General Assembly,\r\nheld in February 1990.\r\nThe escalation of drug abuse and illicit trafficking\r\ncontinues to endanger the health of individuals and to\r\nthreaten the very fabric of society, particularly with respect\r\nto national security, economic stability and social welfare.\r\nThe Political Declaration’s proclamation of the United\r\nNations Decade against Drug Abuse, 1991-2000, was a\r\nrecognition of the need for effective national, regional and\r\ninternational action to promote the Global Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nMy delegation has risen to the challenge, particularly at\r\nthe national and regional levels. Our National Drug Law\r\nEnforcement Agency has been strengthened and reorganized.\r\nIn that connection, six operational zones have been created;\r\ninterdiction and investigation activities are coordinated from\r\nthese zones. Each zone has the mandate to monitor closely\r\nthe international airports, sea ports and land borders. The\r\nAgency has also established a Narcotics Communications\r\nInitiative Committee charged with the close study of the\r\nmodes of operation of drug traffickers. In addition, it is\r\nhoped that its training school in Jos, Plateau state, will be\r\nupgraded by the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP) to a regional training centre to service\r\nanglophone West African countries.\r\nNigeria was one of the first Member States to ratify the\r\nUnited Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic\r\nDrugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988. It has also\r\nentered into bilateral agreements with many countries in the\r\nareas of drug trafficking and abuse, and has prescribed stiff\r\npenalties against drug offenders. In view of my country’s\r\nacknowledgement of the role of controlled delivery systems,\r\nwhich make for greater harmony and mutual trust between\r\ncountries, Nigeria has successfully put into practice a\r\ncontrolled delivery system with the British Government.\r\nMy delegation acknowledges the role of the UNDCP,\r\nthe International Narcotics Control Board and the\r\nCommission on Narcotic Drugs in the fight against the drug\r\nscourge. The UNDCP, in particular, has played a major role\r\nin this regard since its establishment. Through its\r\norganization of seminars and workshops, and particularly\r\nthrough its support for the activities of the Heads of National\r\nDrug Law Enforcement Agencies (HONLEA), the UNDCP\r\nhas been playing a major role in the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to eradicate the drug menace.\r\nHowever, the UNDCP needs the resources to implement its\r\nlaudable policies and programmes. We therefore hope that\r\nthe international community will continue to extend much\r\nneeded resources to the UNDCP.\r\nThere is also a need to complement the efforts of\r\neconomically disadvantaged States by providing them with\r\nthe necessary resources. In this respect we reiterate the need\r\nto give serious consideration to the sharing of proceeds\r\nconfiscated from convicted drug traffickers with the States\r\nwhere they are domiciled. This is especially necessary\r\nwhere such States have materially assisted in investigations\r\nby providing a direct, timely and unimpeded flow of\r\ninformation leading to the arrest of the traffickers and the\r\nconfiscation of the proceeds of their crime. The availability\r\nof such resources will certainly complement the efforts of\r\nthe relevant drug-enforcement agencies by making them\r\nmore proactive in combating the drug menace. We also call\r\nfor an upward review of the present sum of $3.3 million\r\nallocated to more than 50 States in Africa for technical\r\ncooperation in drug matters, out of the total appropriation of\r\n$57.7 million.\r\nIt is the view of my delegation that to facilitate the\r\nmonitoring and rapid interception of drug traffickers\r\noperational information should be readily exchanged at the\r\nappropriate levels. To achieve this, we call for the\r\nestablishment and maintenance of focal points for the\r\nexchange of such information by Member States.\r\nMy delegation supports draft resolution A/48/L.12,\r\nwhich provides that the services of experts could be engaged\r\nby the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in its policy-making\r\nrole, where necessary. We believe that such an arrangement\r\nwould allow for the injection of new and viable ideas into\r\nthe operations of both the Commission on Narcotic Drugs\r\nand the UNDCP. Because of the importance we attach to\r\nthem, we also agree with the suggestion in the draft\r\nresolution that such issues be further discussed by the high-\r\nlevel segment of the Economic and Social Council next year.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to reiterate its\r\nconviction that international cooperation is the main\r\nrequirement for effectively combating the drug nightmare.\r\nThe fight against drug trafficking and drug abuse also\r\nrequires constant imaginative ideas to match the\r\nsophistication of drug traffickers. I am convinced that, given\r\nthe constant threat of this deadly scourge, we can no longer\r\nrely on mere ineffective clichés, but must take positive\r\naction.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Arabic): The\r\nnext speaker is Major-General Salahuddin Tirmizi, Director-\r\nGeneral of the Anti-Narcotics Task Force of Pakistan, upon\r\nwhom I now call.\r\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMr. TIRMIZI (Pakistan): It is my honour and privilege\r\nto deliver this statement on behalf of my country on this\r\nimportant agenda item dealing with the control of narcotic\r\ndrugs.\r\nI should like to begin by expressing my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to the President of the General Assembly for his\r\nimportant statement on international drug control. I should\r\nalso like to thank the Secretary-General for his reports under\r\nthis item and for his statement, which was read out by Mr.\r\nGiorgio Giacomelli, Executive Director of the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP).\r\nMy delegation is deeply alarmed by the magnitude of\r\nthe escalating trends in drug abuse, the illicit trafficking,\r\ndemand, production, supply and distribution of narcotic\r\ndrugs and psychotropic substances. Those activities pose a\r\ngrave and persistent threat to the health and well-being of\r\nnations and a challenge to the political, economic, social and\r\ncultural structures of all societies. They affect the lives and\r\ndignity of millions of human beings, most especially young\r\npeople. The proliferation of narcotic drugs not only\r\naccounts for an upsurge in crime, violence and corruption,\r\nbut is a constant drain on human, financial, intellectual and\r\nother resources, thus impairing the capacity of countries in\r\ntheir efforts to achieve social and economic development.\r\nThe extraordinarily high level of illicit consumption,\r\ntrafficking and production of narcotic drugs and psychotropic\r\nsubstances necessitates a comprehensive approach to\r\ninternational cooperation in drug-abuse control and\r\ncounter-offensives at the international, regional and national\r\nlevels. The universal concern and determination to take\r\neffective, coherent and concerted efforts against the drug\r\nproblem culminated in the adoption by the General\r\nAssembly at its seventeenth special session in 1990 of the\r\nPolitical Declaration and Global Programme of Action.\r\nSince its creation in 1991 the UNDCP has been doing an\r\nadmirable job to coordinate all United Nations drug-control\r\nactivities and to implement the Programme of Action\r\nadopted at the seventeenth special session.\r\nNo strategy to control this scourge can succeed without\r\naddressing all aspects of the problem in all its\r\nmanifestations. Production and supply of illicit narcotic\r\ndrugs are inextricably linked to demand. Until recently the\r\ninternational efforts to curb the menace were rather lopsided,\r\nconcentrating mainly on supply reduction. My delegation is\r\nhappy to note that due recognition is now being given to the\r\nimportance of reducing demand. In his message on the\r\noccasion of the International Day against Drug Abuse and\r\nIllicit Trafficking earlier this year, the Secretary-General\r\nstated that:\r\n\"While there must be no lessening of efforts in the\r\nother areas of drug control, the emphasis must now\r\nshift to demand reduction.\"\r\nWe also share the view that demand reduction should be part\r\nof a comprehensive and balanced approach to the long-term\r\ngoal of eliminating drug abuse.\r\nThe Government of Pakistan attaches high priority to\r\nthe eradication of the drug menace from the country. Our\r\nefforts are aimed at various aspects of the problem,\r\nparticularly supply-reduction programmes and curbs on illicit\r\ndrug trafficking. Those initiatives include programmes for\r\nthe eradication of the production of narcotic substances, the\r\nelimination of processing and trafficking, the treatment and\r\nrehabilitation of addicts and community intervention on drug\r\nabuse.\r\nA number of important administrative and legislative\r\nmeasures have been taken in the recent past to control the\r\nproblem. These include the establishment of the\r\nAnti-Narcotics Task Force, which, like the existing agencies\r\ndirectly involved in drug control, investigates cases of drug\r\ntrafficking and prosecutes the criminal under the law. The\r\nAnti-Narcotics Task Force Ordinance empowers the Force to\r\nsearch, investigate and arrest those involved in the drug\r\ntrade. In order to deal quickly with crimes related to drugs,\r\nsuch cases are being referred to special courts for speedy\r\ntrials.\r\nIn December 1991, the Government of Pakistan\r\npromulgated an Ordinance amending the relevant law to\r\nprovide for the destruction of seized narcotics. As a result,\r\nhuge quantities of seized narcotics have since been\r\ndestroyed. In September this year, the Dangerous Drug Act\r\nof 1930 was amended to the effect that courts may order\r\nforfeiture of the assets of a person sentenced to\r\nimprisonment for a term of two years or more. The\r\nprevious law provided for such a forfeiture if an accused\r\nwas sentenced to life imprisonment. Also in September,\r\nrelevant provisions of law have been amended to include the\r\ndeath penalty in case of certain serious offences relating to\r\ndrug trafficking. Also, through a Presidential Ordinance,\r\nlegal lacunae regarding the definition of opium have been\r\nremoved from the relevant laws.\r\nPakistan has made significant progress in curbing the\r\nproduction of narcotics. Since the crop season of 1978-79,\r\nthe acreage under poppy cultivation has been reduced from\r\n80,500 acres to about 15,000 acres in 1992-93. The\r\nproduction of opium has been reduced from 800 tons in\r\n1978-79 to about 150 tons in 1992-93. This has been\r\npossible through the implementation of a variety of\r\ncrop-substitution and area-development schemes and the\r\nprovision of economic incentives and alternate means of\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 33\r\nincome to the traditional poppy growers. The Government\r\nhas also undertaken infrastructural development projects by\r\nbuilding new roads, schools and irrigation channels to ensure\r\nsocio-economic development in such areas.\r\nAs a result of intensified interdiction measures, the law\r\nenforcement agencies seized 3,378 kilograms of opium,\r\n3,129 kilograms of heroin and over 160,000 kilograms of\r\nhashish during the first 8 months of this year. Our law\r\nenforcement agencies are also maintaining a close liaison\r\nwith their counterparts in other countries as well as with\r\nINTERPOL in order to exchange information about drug\r\ntraffickers and to take legal action against them.\r\nTogether with preventive measures through effective\r\nand rigorous law enforcement, education provides the\r\npossibility of keeping people away from drugs. In Pakistan,\r\na programme is under implementation to educate the masses\r\nand the target groups about the ill effects of drug abuse.\r\nAttention is also being given to training persons in the field\r\nof prevention throughout the country so that they in turn will\r\ntrain community workers.\r\nGovernments and intergovernmental organizations alone\r\ncannot resolve this problem. Therefore, every effort is being\r\nmade to utilize available resources at the local level among\r\nfamilies, teachers, social workers, religious leaders and\r\nhealth-care workers and to mobilize non-governmental\r\norganizations to combat this scourge.\r\nIn the regional context, the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) is pursuing drug control\r\nactivities through a technical committee on the prevention of\r\ndrug trafficking and drug abuse. Between 1988 and 1992,\r\nthis committee carried out 20 major subregional programmes\r\ninvolving key policymakers and other professionals in the\r\nfield of law enforcement and demand reduction. Pakistan is\r\na party to the SAARC Convention on narcotic drugs.\r\nSimilarly, the 10-member Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization has also established anti-narcotics committees,\r\nthus providing another important regional framework for\r\ncooperation in combating drug trafficking.\r\nThe Global Programme of Action focuses on several\r\nareas of cooperation in the multilateral context. These\r\ninclude the increased involvement of specialized agencies,\r\nother United Nations bodies and international financial\r\ninstitutions in prevention activities and alternative-\r\ndevelopment and crop-substitution programmes.\r\nSignificantly, the International Monetary Fund has singled\r\nout the drug problem as one of five global priorities. In\r\ndeveloping countries, drug trafficking is linked to poverty.\r\nThe programmes of international financial institutions\r\nrelating to poverty eradication therefore have great bearing\r\non eliminating the drug menace. It is important that\r\ninternational financial institutions provide generous\r\nassistance to developing countries, especially those that have\r\nlaunched a crusade against illicit drugs.\r\nMy delegation also accords high priority to the need for\r\nallocating the necessary financial, personnel and other\r\nresources for drug control activities within the United\r\nNations system. It is therefore essential to provide a greater\r\namount of resources to the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme both through the regular budget\r\nand through voluntary extrabudgetary contributions in order\r\nto enable it to respond effectively to the needs and\r\nrequirements of developing countries in combating the drug\r\nproblem.\r\nIn the context of economic assistance, we believe that\r\npriority should be given to farmers in the poppy-growing\r\nareas and that industrial units should be established to\r\ngenerate alternative income sources and employment\r\nopportunities. The cultivators of substitute crops must also\r\nget better access for their products in the international\r\nmarkets. Here, international cooperation assumes\r\nfundamental importance. Furthermore, law enforcement\r\nagencies involved in drug control programmes in developing\r\ncountries are in need of modern equipment to enhance their\r\nprofessional skills and effectiveness. The developed\r\ncountries can play an important role in the provision of such\r\nequipment, meeting high operational costs and training the\r\npersonnel of the enforcement agencies.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the scourge\r\nof drug abuse can only be tackled by effective international\r\ncooperation. A clear strategy is in place in the resolutions\r\nand decisions of the seventeenth special session. Let us\r\nrenew our resolve to make the Global Programme of Action\r\na success by concerted action on the international, regional\r\nand national levels. For its part, Pakistan remains resolutely\r\ncommitted to taking all possible actions to eliminate and\r\neradicate the narcotics problems. In this context, it is\r\npertinent to bring to the notice of the Assembly that the\r\nPrime Minister of Pakistan, Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, in her first\r\ncabinet meeting held yesterday, identified the eradication of\r\nthe narcotic drug problem as one of the six priority areas of\r\nher Government.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Arabic): I call\r\non Mr. Jean-Marie Kacon Gervais, Permanent Representative\r\nof Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nMr. GERVAIS (Côte d’Ivoire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Over the past two decades and especially since\r\n1980, the abuse and illicit trafficking of drugs have grown\r\nat a frightening pace, sparing no national borders and\r\nwithout regard to the socio-economic development of\r\ncountries around the globe. Hence, this phenomenon has not\r\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nbypassed Africa any more than it has bypassed any other\r\ncontinent.\r\nAlready weakened by an unprecedented economic crisis,\r\nand without having been forearmed, our countries have\r\nfound themselves in the grip of a complex criminal and drug\r\nproblem with all the social consequences it entails. We had\r\nto start from scratch in learning about this new threat, which\r\nis bound to the no-less delicate question of\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nWe had to learn very quickly that eliminating this\r\nglobal scourge required steadfast political will and fortitude\r\nin mobilizing major human and material resources on the\r\nnational, regional and international levels. With that\r\nawareness, most African Governments have shown their\r\npolitical will by acceding to international legal instruments\r\nrelating to the fight against drug abuse and illegal trafficking\r\nin narcotics and psychotropic substances. They have\r\nlikewise made praiseworthy endeavours to try to stop the\r\ngrowth in, or even diminish trafficking in and consumption\r\nof, drugs. Despite their modest means, they continue today\r\nto confront the threat.\r\nYet all these efforts seem not to have borne fruit. The\r\ndimensions and complexity of the phenomenon exceed all\r\npredictions, and the rudimentary means available to our\r\nStates are far from being able to respond to a global\r\nproblem. Though not the main victim, Africa today seems\r\nto have become integrated into this vast illegal enterprise as\r\na fulcrum of activity.\r\nHow did this come about? Why this explosion of drug\r\ntrafficking and narcotics use in our countries? The causes\r\nare many, but relate principally to Africa’s current\r\nsocio-economic situation, which is illustrated by several\r\nfactors.\r\nThe first is poverty. The continuing impoverishment of\r\nAfricans is a major factor in the increased trafficking in and\r\nproduction and abuse of drugs.\r\nSecondly, the low prices of our export products make\r\nour peasants turn, under the influence of traffickers, to\r\nclandestine cultivation of cannabis or to other kinds of\r\nunorthodox agricultural enterprises; the profits may be\r\nillegal, but they are far greater than those generated by\r\ntraditional crops. It is true that we have not yet reached that\r\npoint, but persistent low export prices and the ongoing\r\nimpoverishment of the rural masses make us fear that we\r\nshall.\r\nThirdly, the economic crisis, with its attendant\r\nmarginalization, layoffs, unemployment and school-leaving,\r\nencourages drug abuse, previously unknown in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica but now on its way to becoming a way for people to\r\nforget their harsh living conditions.\r\nFourthly, civil war, famine, natural disaster and drought\r\nwith their attendant poverty, violence, corruption and\r\ncommunity destabilization also encourage the spread of\r\ndrugs in our countries, at least in terms of their production\r\nand sale as substitute resources.\r\nFifthly, our borders are porous, owing to insufficient\r\ntrained customs and police personnel and to a lack of\r\nfunding for surveillance and control. Before we knew it,\r\nAfrica gradually was becoming a favourite site for\r\ntraffickers: a transit area without major risks for contraband\r\nfrom many sources. Statistics show that the quantity of hard\r\ndrugs seized in Africa in 1991 was six times that reported in\r\n1990. This is exponential growth. How can we fail to be\r\naghast?\r\nObviously, Africa alone cannot allocate the considerable\r\nresources needed for an effective fight against a phenomenon\r\nof these dimensions. International cooperation is\r\nindispensable if we are to dismantle the networks in our\r\ncapitals, which have become drug-transit strongholds.\r\nIn that connection, I cannot fail to pay a well-deserved\r\ntribute to the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP), whose sustained assistance to our\r\nGovernments is helping us strengthen our machinery in the\r\nfight against drugs. There is no need here to speak of\r\nUNDCP’s crucial role in its sphere of activity. Faced with\r\nthe complexity and seriousness of drug-related questions, it\r\ncoordinates activities to avoid wasted effort and useless\r\noutlays. It redounds to the Secretary-General’s honour that\r\nhe conceived of coordinating anti-drug activities through a\r\nmore rational allocation of responsibilities.\r\nWe are pleased that the UNDCP regional office\r\norganized a seminar, held from 15 to 19 March 1993 at\r\nAbidjan, for foreign-affairs officials of States members of\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States and the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States, to inform\r\nand train them on the drug problem. The participants, from\r\n27 countries members of those subregional economic-\r\nintegration organizations, recommended measures aimed at:\r\nratification by all States of the Conventions of 1961, 1971\r\nand 1988 and harmonization of their national legislation to\r\nstrengthen the anti-drug struggle; further building of\r\nsubregional and regional cooperation through the\r\nestablishment of a subregional and regional anti-drug\r\nstructure; further intensification of international cooperation;\r\nprovision of basic and advanced training for officials\r\nresponsible for the prevention, repression, treatment and\r\nsocial reintegration of addicts; bolstering of measures against\r\nlaundering drug money; and recognition of the need to\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 35\r\nincrease assistance to Africa, the most vulnerable of the\r\ncontinents. They also recommended UNDCP assistance in\r\nthe areas of prevention, repression and social reintegration.\r\nThose recommendations were ratified at the Cairo summit\r\nmeeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which\r\ndeclared the anti-drug struggle to be a high priority for\r\nAfrican States.\r\nTurning to my own country, Côte d’Ivoire, I need\r\nhardly remind members that we were the first in Africa to\r\nestablish a ministry for the anti-drug struggle; this reflected\r\nour keen awareness of the dangers of the drug phenomenon.\r\nHad it not been for the deep economic crisis we are facing,\r\nthat department would have continued to exist and to\r\ncoordinate our efforts in the fight against the production, sale\r\nand use of narcotics. None the less, my Government\r\nremains convinced of the soundness of current programmes,\r\nwhich are coordinated by an interministerial committee for\r\nthe anti-drug struggle.\r\nBut alas, faced with the size of the job, our needs are\r\nimmense and our available means are modest indeed. In\r\norder to eradicate this phenomenon, we will require the\r\nmeans to inform and sensitize our peoples on the real danger\r\nof drugs. In order to put an end to the production of drugs,\r\nother sources of income must be found or our traditional\r\ncash crops must be made profitable enough to discourage\r\nunlawful agricultural speculations involving drugs and\r\npsychotropic products.\r\nIn an excellent report produced by the United Nations\r\nSecretariat, mention is made, in substance, of the fact that\r\ndrug-produced revenues are at the very heart of the\r\neconomies in crisis. It must thus be feared that our rural\r\npopulations, discouraged by excessively low prices for\r\nproduction and export, will only exacerbate this danger.\r\nAny positive result in the fight against drugs must depend on\r\nour economic growth. Only by promoting development will\r\nit be possible to put an end to this phenomenon, spawned by\r\npoverty and the impoverishment of rural and urban masses.\r\nFrom this perspective, the eradication of poverty would\r\nappear to be one of the first measures to be taken. At the\r\nsame time, the international community should agree to\r\nmobilize substantial funding to enable the UNDCP to\r\ndispose of the means without which the Programme cannot\r\nhope to attain its objectives.\r\nMoreover, the frozen assets of drug traffickers should\r\nserve to strengthen cooperation, not only on the bilateral\r\nlevel between consumer and producer countries, as has been\r\nthe case until now, but also among transit countries such as\r\nour own. It is from the need to eliminate this scourge that\r\nthe notion of shared responsibility invoked by General\r\nAssembly resolution 47/102 takes its full meaning.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Arabic): I now\r\nrecognize Colonel Saleh Mohammed Al-Sheikh, Assistant\r\nUnder-Secretary of the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Interior in\r\ncharge of humanitarian affairs.\r\nMr. AL-SHEIKH (Saudi Arabia) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): The narcotic trade is expanding on an international\r\nscale. Therefore the competent agencies engaged in\r\ncombating drugs are intent upon alerting the world to the\r\nthreat posed by the unprecedented spread of that trade. The\r\nprices of certain drugs, such as heroin, have actually dropped\r\nin some regions due to availability and excess supply, yet\r\nthe profits realized are abundant and vary from place to\r\nplace, on the long road from the producing countries to the\r\ndistribution and consumption areas.\r\nDrugs are smuggled by the most effective methods of\r\ncamouflage, sometimes by resorting to bribery and the\r\ntemptation of material gain and, if the need arises, by force\r\nand coercion. Consequently, it has become much more\r\ndifficult to combat the international drug trade in general,\r\nespecially now, in view of the increasing tendency of\r\ntraffickers to launder their ill-gotten gains through the\r\ncollusion of networks of middlemen. Some countries and\r\nfinancial centres are now known to be places where money\r\nlaundering operations are carried out without difficulty or\r\nhindrance. The task of drug combating agencies, therefore,\r\nhas become much more difficult and complex. Drug\r\ntrafficking is no longer the trade of small-time pushers; it\r\nhas become big business and the preserve of huge\r\ninternational and regional cartels which use the most modern\r\nmethods of smuggling, distribution and money laundering.\r\nSome studies indicate that the financial returns of the drug\r\ntrade have outstripped by far the revenues of the petroleum\r\ntrade in its entirety.\r\nIt is no wonder then that the drug problem has become\r\nthe source of serious concern for the international\r\ncommunity as a whole because of its dangerous effects and\r\nthe medical, security and economic problems it causes. It is\r\na scourge that threatens the very existence of humanity and\r\ncould lead to the disintegration of the family and the\r\ndisruption of any country’s social fabric. We in the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia consider the danger posed by\r\ndrugs to be more lethal than the most destructive weapons\r\nof modern warfare.\r\nThe Kingdom, having witnessed the vast and dangerous\r\nspread of drugs in many countries, did not wait for this\r\nlethal scourge to attack it. Saudi Arabia has taken all\r\npossible steps and precautions to prevent an internal drug\r\nproblem from arising. The Kingdom continues to deploy all\r\npossible efforts at every local, regional and international\r\nlevel. It has signed international agreements to fight the\r\nspread of narcotics and psychotropic substances; it has\r\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nenacted legislation to combat the smugglers and pushers of\r\nthese poisons; and it has encouraged bilateral agreements\r\nand signed quite a number of them.\r\nDrug combating efforts will not succeed except through\r\ntotal and close cooperation and coordination between all the\r\nagencies and authorities involved in drug combating\r\nactivities in every country. Such cooperative efforts have\r\nsuccessfully forestalled many attempts to smuggle drugs.\r\nThe war against drugs and the criminal organizations which\r\ntraffic in them will not be effective without joint action by\r\nall concerned parties. That is why the Arab countries,\r\nincluding the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, have agreed on\r\nconcerted strategies to ensure cooperation in the war against\r\ndrugs by sharing information in order to forestall attempts to\r\nsmuggle drugs into any Arab territory.\r\nThe 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit\r\nTrafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\r\ncalls on the parties to the Convention to enact laws in\r\nconformity with its provisions. The Convention represents\r\nthe most effective means of combating the drug trade\r\nthrough the revitalization of international cooperation and\r\nmutual assistance, and by seeking the means of preventing\r\ndrug smugglers from reaping the benefits of their illicit\r\nactivities. It encourages the enactment of legislation to\r\ncriminalize money laundering, and aims at preventing\r\ninternational borders from becoming barriers that hinder\r\nefforts to bring offenders to justice, since drug trafficking\r\nrecognizes no boundaries.\r\nIn response to the Convention, the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia has entered, through its competent authorities, into\r\nagreements for the extradition of criminals and the exchange\r\nof legal assistance, criminalized money laundering\r\noperations, and prepared a new anti-drug law, now in the\r\nfinal stages of formulation, which conforms to the 1988\r\nConvention. The Government of Saudi Arabia will thus be\r\nenacting the most modern laws in the fight against the drug\r\ntrade.\r\nThe delegation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wishes\r\nto remind the distinguished delegates that in addition to the\r\naforementioned steps taken to prevent the spread of drugs,\r\nwe must concentrate on the local priorities such as informing\r\nthe public on the moral, medical, social and economic\r\ndangers of drug abuse; enacting stringent laws against drug\r\ntraffickers; making treatment available to the victims of the\r\ndrug trade; and setting up effective anti-drug agencies\r\nequipped with the latest technologies.\r\nI wish to reaffirm that Saudi Arabia resolutely supports\r\nevery international effort to combat the drug trade through\r\ncooperation and constructive dialogue founded on a deep\r\nrespect for the experiences of States and peoples and their\r\nparticular cultural heritage.\r\nSaudi Arabia’s interest in supporting the United Nations\r\nprogrammes and the international cooperation mechanism\r\ndoes not stem from the scope of this scourge in the\r\nKingdom, but rather from a sense of international\r\nresponsibility, on the one hand, and from our conviction, on\r\nthe other, that drug trafficking does not recognize\r\ninternational borders. Our reading of the direction the drug\r\ntrade is taking, on the international level, in the 1990s gives\r\nus cause for concern because of its expanding scope and the\r\nincreasing sophistication of its methods. Such a situation\r\npresents the international community with major challenges\r\nat a time when it is striving to promote ethical behaviour\r\nand to fight drug pushers by every possible means.\r\nOur Government views with satisfaction the\r\ninternational efforts now being deployed with a view to\r\nstrengthening cooperation in the area of security at the\r\nregional and international levels. Saudi Arabia particularly\r\nappreciates the efforts of the United Nations and its Member\r\nStates to create the appropriate climate for strengthening\r\ninternational efforts in the area of combating drugs.\r\nI should like to emphasize the need to formulate a\r\ncomprehensive strategy that would combine theory and\r\npractice as well as prevention and enforcement. To achieve\r\nsuch an objective, we have to cooperate as States, agencies\r\nand organizations toward the creation of a world community\r\nthat would be able to live in security, safety and prosperity.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mohammed Taryam, the Director\r\nGeneral of Security Affairs in the Ministry of the Interior in\r\nthe United Arab Emirates.\r\nMr. TARYAM (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): At the outset, I should like to pay tribute to\r\nthe tireless efforts and the constructive contributions of the\r\nCommission on Narcotic Drugs, the International Narcotics\r\nControl Board and the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme. I would like to reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to carrying out the functions and tasks\r\ncontained in the Global Programme of Action on\r\ninternational cooperation against drugs, in the context of the\r\nUnited Nations Decade against Drug Abuse.\r\nThe problem of drugs is undoubtedly one of the most\r\nimportant and pressing issues that affect the security and the\r\nvery future of mankind, given its grave consequences. In\r\naddition to its local aspect, it is a global problem, because it\r\nimpacts the economic, social, political and security\r\nconditions of most countries of the world. We are\r\nconvinced that this problem cannot be effectively addressed\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 37\r\nat the local level alone or by local thinking alone. The\r\nproblem of drug abuse is not confined within the national\r\nborders of any one country, but transcends those borders and\r\nimpacts other countries. Herein lies the global aspect of the\r\nproblem. We cannot claim or delude ourselves that there is\r\none single country on this planet that could consider itself to\r\nbe immune to the pernicious evils of drugs that endanger\r\nmankind as a whole and whose gravity is exacerbated from\r\none year to the next.\r\nThe development of new kinds of drugs and the\r\ncontinued efforts by drug traffickers to promote these new\r\ndrugs throughout the world despite international efforts to\r\ncombat their endeavours have combined in making the\r\nproblem more complex and intractable.\r\nMankind has made enormous progress since the\r\nconclusion of the first Convention on drugs in Shanghai in\r\n1908. Since then many international conventions and\r\nprotocols have been concluded in an attempt to realize the\r\naspirations of the world community after a formula whereby\r\nthe problems of supply, demand and trafficking of illicit\r\ndrugs may be brought under control. So far we have 15\r\nsuch conventions and protocols. Most important are the\r\nSingle Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, as amended\r\nby the 1972 Protocol, the Convention on Psychotropic\r\nSubstances of 1971, and the United Nations Convention\r\nagainst Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\r\nSubstances of 1988. All of these instruments represent\r\nresolute international efforts over a long period of time to\r\nrationalize world action and strategy at the national, regional\r\nand international levels against the illicit use of drugs.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has developed a local\r\nstrategy based on the global strategies developed by\r\ninternational and regional organizations and on the Arab\r\nstrategy developed by the Pan-Arab Bureau for Drug\r\nControl. In deference to the international conventions in this\r\nregard to which my country is a party, we try to harmonize\r\nour local conditions accordingly. Competent authorities in\r\nthe United Arab Emirates try to harmonize our national\r\nlegislation on combating drugs with the provisions of those\r\nconventions. We are also drafting a law on the laundering\r\nof proceeds from crime with particular emphasis on drug-\r\nrelated crimes.\r\nOur strategy focuses on the reduction of demand and\r\nthe prevention of drug use by developing an approach that\r\ntakes into account the need for increasing awareness,\r\ntreatment, rehabilitation side by side with law enforcement\r\nmeasures. This is supervised and followed up by a higher\r\nnational committee against drugs whose efforts are directed\r\ntowards prevention of the entry of these toxic substances\r\ninto our country. Regional and international cooperation and\r\nexchange of information are essential in this respect.\r\nIn promotion of international action, we continue to\r\nwork with the United Nations Development Programme, the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme, the\r\nInternational Narcotics Control Board, the Commission on\r\nNarcotic Drugs of the Economic and Social Council, and the\r\nnarcotics branch and other international organizations and\r\norgans. The diffusion and exchange of information as well\r\nas participation in seminars and training programmes offered\r\nby these organs are of vital importance.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates hosted on 3 October 1992\r\nthe World Conference of Experts in Drug Control.\r\nThirty-one States and nine international organizations\r\nparticipated in that Conference which, at the conclusion of\r\nits work, made comprehensive and important\r\nrecommendations calling for consolidation of all efforts by\r\nStates and for cooperation by international organizations in\r\nconfronting this menace which endangers all mankind by\r\nexchanging information and expertise and by organizing\r\nlocal, regional and international meetings. While there is\r\ngood faith in promoting international cooperation to confront\r\nthese problems, we call for an expansion of this cooperation\r\non the basis of the United Nations Convention against Illicit\r\nTraffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of\r\n1988. This Convention provides a good legal basis for such\r\ncooperation. In this context, we urge those countries that\r\nhave not acceded to and/or ratified that Convention to do so\r\nwithout delay. We also call for training programmes under\r\nthe United Nations International Drug Control Programme to\r\nbe stepped up in both quantity and quality, especially with\r\nregard to the training of police and customs agents who are\r\nin charge of law enforcement in combating drugs.\r\nBeneficiary countries should contribute their own inputs and\r\ntheir assessment to such programmes so that they may\r\ncontinue to be improved.\r\nWith regard to the question of paying compensation to\r\nfarmers in the producing countries and the development of\r\nsubstitute crops, my country supports the recommendations\r\nof international conferences on combating drugs.\r\nWe feel that the United Nations, with its specialized\r\nagencies, is the world body most qualified to implement\r\nthose recommendations and translate them into realities in\r\norder to promote international cooperation in the area of\r\nsubstitutive rural development, and put an end to the dangers\r\nto the environment that arise from illicit cultivation. In\r\norder to avoid economic and social dislocation in the\r\nproducing countries, the international community should\r\nprovide technical, economic and financial assistance to those\r\ncountries with a view to promoting substitutive development,\r\nwhile combating trafficking across the transit countries and\r\ndiminishing the capability to satisfy the demand for drugs in\r\nthe consuming countries. My delegation also calls for\r\nstringent measures in the area of monitoring the returns of\r\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ndrug trafficking and for the international criminalization of\r\nthe practice of money laundering.\r\nCombating the abuse of and trafficking in drugs is part\r\nand parcel of the need to comprehensively address the\r\neconomic and social problems that beset the countries of the\r\nworld in a manner that would enable those countries to\r\nachieve sustainable development and political stability. It is\r\nself-evident that the political upheavals, situations of\r\neconomic recession and the natural disasters that afflict\r\nmany countries have very serious consequences that tend to\r\naugment the numbers of those who take refuge from\r\nadversity by giving in to the temptation of drug abuse and\r\naddiction.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm that combating\r\ndrugs is not merely a national or regional question, but also\r\nan international issue that must be addressed in the interests\r\nof all mankind.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Arabic): I now\r\ncall on Dr. Isaac Barreto Ribeiro, President of the Federal\r\nDrug Council of Brazil.\r\nMr. BARRETO RIBEIRO (Brazil) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The subject of drugs belongs to a class of\r\nproblems about which two things can be said with certainty.\r\nThe first is that we recognize the global scope of the\r\nproblem. The second is that we are aware that any proposed\r\nsolutions require broad international cooperation.\r\nFor this reason, both the clear political will of States, as\r\nshown by the implementation of international agreements,\r\nand the effective implementation, by common accord, of\r\nmeasures to deal with the problem might seem to give us\r\nsufficient reason to imagine a future in which drugs,\r\nalthough still a cause for concern, would no longer be a\r\nserious threat to the very survival of society.\r\nYet it is rather surprising that recent reports on the\r\nproblem give the impression that, despite all that has been\r\ndone, the drug situation is in many respects the same as it\r\nwas some years ago. That is certainly not because of inertia\r\nor lack of action.\r\nThe drugs division of the Federal Police, in trying to\r\nstamp out drugs, is currently carrying out 11 programmes.\r\nFirst, there is the cannabis eradication programme. In\r\n1992 more than 2 million cannabis plants were uprooted.\r\nThe same year about 19.5 tons of consumption-ready\r\ncannabis were confiscated. This year we have already\r\nuprooted more than 2.1 million cannabis plants. Rural\r\nfarmland used for illegal planting can be confiscated and\r\nreturned to the State.\r\nSecond, there is the programme to eradicate epadú, also\r\nknown as Brazilian coca. As a result of the activities of the\r\nFederal Police, the amount of land used to cultivate epadú\r\nis diminishing year by year.\r\nThird, we have a programme to combat organized\r\ncrime. This involves exchanging information on drug\r\ntraffickers between various specialized agencies that deal\r\nwith combating drugs.\r\nFourth, we have a programme to combat the cartels.\r\nAs proof of the success of this programme, the Federal\r\nPolice have been able to prevent almost 7,000 tons of\r\ncocaine from coming onto the consumer market.\r\nFifth, there is a programme to control precursor\r\nchemicals and derivatives used in manufacturing drugs.\r\nUsing computers, we have been able to achieve better\r\ncontrol over the flow of substances under international\r\ncontrol.\r\nSixth, we have a programme employing trained sniffer\r\ndogs to interdict illicit drugs.\r\nSeventh, we are running a programme of symposiums\r\nto raise awareness of the dangers of drugs.\r\nEighth, there is a programme to monitor our rivers and\r\ncoasts.\r\nNinth, we have a programme to intercept radio\r\ncommunications in the Amazon region.\r\nTenth, we have a programme to interdict drugs in our\r\nports and airports.\r\nEleventh, we have a computerization programme so that\r\nwe can set up a data bank.\r\nThese are the main activities currently being carried out\r\nby the Federal Police in trying to stamp out illicit drugs.\r\nIn the area of prevention and rehabilitation, the Federal\r\nNarcotics Council, the central body responsible for national\r\ndrug policy in Brazil, has approved a national drug plan,\r\nwhose guidelines include systemizing the available\r\ninformation on the drug situation, training drug prevention\r\nagents, mobilizing the community and improving the\r\nrelevant legislation.\r\nIn order to achieve the goals of our national drug\r\npolicy, we have identified the following strategies: first,\r\ndevelopment of an epidemiological census so that we can\r\nview the problem from all aspects in as much detail as\r\npossible; secondly, setting up a national system of\r\nprevention; thirdly, together with the press, the carrying out\r\n40th meeting - Wednesday, 27 October l993 39\r\nof consciousness-raising and prevention campaigns; fourthly,\r\ntraining experts in drug prevention; fifthly trying to raise\r\ncommunities’ awareness so that they will support campaigns\r\nto prevent and treat drug abuse and to rehabilitate addicts;\r\nsixthly use of the education system as the primary\r\nprevention mechanism; and, seventhly, adapting the basic\r\nhealth care system to treat drug users.\r\nBrazil has always tried to contribute to the international\r\ncooperative effort to combat drugs. Similarly, it has always\r\ntried to increase the means available to meet this challenge\r\non the domestic front.\r\nSince taking office President Itamar Franco has\r\nimpressed on the Government the importance of respecting\r\nethical principles. The fight against drugs must be a fight\r\nfor ethics, waged ethically. It must also be a struggle that\r\ndoes not lose sight of the principles of law and, above all,\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8 p.m.\r\n"
