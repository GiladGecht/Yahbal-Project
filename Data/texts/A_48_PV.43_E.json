"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n43rd\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nFriday, 29 October 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 3 (continued)\r\nCREDENTIALS OF REPRESENTATIVES TO THE\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION OF THE GENERAL\r\nASSEMBLY\r\n(b) FIRST REPORT OF THE CREDENTIALS\r\nCOMMITTEE (A/48/512)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The draft resolution recommended\r\nby the Credentials Committee in paragraph 12 of its first\r\nreport (A/48/512) reads as follows:\r\n\"The General Assembly,\r\n\"Having considered the first report of the\r\nCredentials Committee and the recommendation\r\ncontained therein,\r\n\"Approves the first report of the Credentials\r\nCommittee.\"\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider the draft resolution\r\nrecommended by the Credentials Committee in its first\r\nreport.\r\nBefore I call on the first speaker in explanation of vote\r\non the recommendation of the Credentials Committee, may\r\nI remind delegations that explanations of vote are limited to\r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. SHAHREZA (Islamic Republic of Iran): My\r\ndelegation wishes to express its reservations regarding\r\nparagraph 4 of the first report of the Credentials Committee,\r\ndocument A/48/512, on the credentials of Israel. For this\r\nreason, and in line with the position of the Government of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran on the issue, my delegation\r\nwishes to dissociate itself from the parts of the said report\r\nreferring to the approval of the credentials of Israel.\r\nMr. AMER (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): At a time when the General Assembly\r\nintends to approve the first report of the Credentials\r\nCommittee, document A/48/512, the approval of my\r\ndelegation of this report does not mean at all recognition of\r\nthe credential papers of Israel. Despite the latest\r\ndevelopments on the question of Palestine we do not think\r\nthat this is an overall, comprehensive solution to this\r\nquestion. The solution would be the full recognition of all\r\nthe rights of the Palestinian people and, especially their\r\nrights of return to their homeland, self-determination and the\r\nestablishment of their own independent State.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We shall now take action on the\r\nrecommendation of the Credentials Committee contained in\r\nparagraph 12 of its first report (A/48/512).\r\nThe Committee adopted the draft resolution without a\r\nvote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do the\r\nsame?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 48/13).\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have thus concluded this stage\r\nof our consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 3.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 15 (continued)\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-87012 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.43\r\n22 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nELECTIONS TO FILL VACANCIES IN PRINCIPAL\r\nORGANS\r\n(a) ELECTION OF FIVE NON-PERMANENT\r\nMEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The General Assembly will now\r\nproceed to the election of five non-permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council to replace those members whose term\r\nof office expires on 31 December 1993.\r\nThe five non-permanent outgoing members are the\r\nfollowing: Cape Verde, Hungary, Japan, Morocco and\r\nVenezuela. These five States cannot be re-elected and\r\ntherefore their names should not appear on the ballot papers.\r\nApart from the five permanent members, the Security\r\nCouncil will include in 1994 the following States: Brazil,\r\nDjibouti, New Zealand, Pakistan and Spain. The names of\r\nthose States, therefore, should not appear on the ballot\r\npapers.\r\nOf the five non-permanent members which will remain\r\nin office in 1994 two are from Africa and Asia, one is from\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean and two are from the\r\nGroup of Western European and other States.\r\nConsequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963,\r\nthe five non-permanent members should be elected according\r\nto the following pattern: three from Africa and Asia, one\r\nfrom Eastern Europe and one from Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.\r\nIn accordance with the established practice there is an\r\nunderstanding to the effect that of the three States to be\r\nelected from Africa and Asia, two should be from Africa\r\nand one from Asia.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the number\r\nof candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled,\r\nreceiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds\r\nmajority of those present and voting will be declared elected.\r\nIn the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will\r\nbe a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have\r\nobtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that\r\nprocedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: In accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot,\r\nand there shall be no nominations.\r\nDoes any Member wish to speak before we proceed to\r\nthe election?\r\nI now call on the representative of Zimbabwe as\r\nChairman of the Group of African States.\r\nMr. MUMBENGEGWI (Zimbabwe): Africa has\r\nendorsed the candidature of Rwanda from the central Africa\r\nregion to fill one of the two non-permanent seats in the\r\nSecurity Council to be vacated on 31 December 1993.\r\nHowever, the same cannot be said for the west Africa\r\nregion. Hence both Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria are\r\ncandidates to fill the other non-permanent seat in the\r\nSecurity Council to be vacated on 31 December 1993.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nIndonesia as Chairman of the Group of Asian States.\r\nMr. WISNUMURTI (Indonesia): In my capacity as\r\nChairman of the Asian Group for the month of October 1993\r\nI have the honour to inform the Assembly that the Asian\r\nGroup has endorsed the candidature of the Sultanate of\r\nOman for election to a non-permanent seat in the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nthe Russian Federation as Chairman of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States.\r\nMr. VORONTSOV (Russian Federation)(interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): As Chairman of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States for the month of October I have the honour\r\nto announce that for the one seat for a non-permanent\r\nmember of the Security Council allocated to the Group of\r\nEastern European States there are two candidates, Belarus\r\nand the Czech Republic.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nCuba as Chairman of the Group of Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States.\r\nMr. REMÍREZ DE ESTENOZ (Cuba) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): As Chairman of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, I have the honour of\r\ninforming the General Assembly that the Group supports and\r\nendorses Argentina as the single candidate from our region\r\n43rd meeting - Friday, 29 October l993 3\r\nfor the corresponding seat on the Security Council. We\r\ncommend to the Assembly the candidature of the Republic\r\nof Argentina, confident that Argentina will make a valuable\r\ncontribution to the work of this important organ.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: In accordance with the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall proceed to the election by secret ballot,\r\ntaking into account the statements made by the\r\nrepresentatives of Zimbabwe, Indonesia, the Russian\r\nFederation and Cuba.\r\nBallot papers marked \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" will now be\r\ndistributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot papers\r\nthat have been distributed and to write on them the names of\r\nthe five States for which they wish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing the names of more States\r\nfrom the relevant region than the number of seats assigned\r\nto it will be declared invalid. Names, on a ballot paper, of\r\nMember States that do not belong to that region will not be\r\ncounted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Suziedelis\r\n(Lithuania), Ms. Jonsvik (Norway) and Mr. Berguido\r\n(Panama) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nTRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF MELCHIOR\r\nNDADAYE, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF\r\nBURUNDI\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Before suspending the meeting for\r\nthe counting of ballots, I propose that the General Assembly\r\npay a tribute to the memory of the late President of the\r\nRepublic of Burundi, His Excellency Mr. Melchior Ndadaye.\r\nJust over three weeks ago the General Assembly had\r\nthe honour to hear President Ndadaye’s eloquent, thoughtful\r\nand profound address. In the course of his statement he\r\ninformed us that on 1 June 1993 Burundi had held free, open\r\nand fair general elections for the first time. He believed that\r\nthe path of democracy was the only way to resolve the\r\nproblems of power that affected the Republic.\r\nLast week’s attempted military coup against his\r\nGovernment, in which the President was assassinated, was\r\na serious blow to Burundi’s progress and a personal shock\r\nto all of us who retain very vivid memories of this respected\r\nleader.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly I should like to\r\nconvey our heartfelt condolences to the Government and the\r\npeople of Burundi, and to the bereaved family.\r\nI invite representatives to stand and observe a minute of\r\nsilence in tribute to the memory of the late President of the\r\nRepublic of Burundi.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a\r\nminute of silence.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on the representative of\r\nZimbabwe.\r\nMr. MUMBENGEGWI (Zimbabwe): I should like to\r\nbegin by thanking you, Mr. President, for the tribute that has\r\nbeen paid at this meeting to the memory of the late President\r\nof the Republic of Burundi, His Excellency Mr. Melchior\r\nNdadaye.\r\nAllow me, on behalf of the African Group, to express\r\nto our colleagues in the delegation of Burundi and, through\r\nthem, to the bereaved people of their country our sincere\r\nsympathy and condolences on the very untimely death of\r\ntheir President.\r\nWe in the African Group received the tragic news of\r\nthe assassination of President Ndadaye with great shock and\r\npersonal grief. We had had the singular honour and\r\nprivilege only three weeks earlier of welcoming President\r\nNdadaye to the United Nations, and I as Chairman of the\r\nAfrican Group enjoyed the privilege of presenting him to the\r\nGroup.\r\nMrs. Frechette (Canada), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nHis address to the Group, just like his earlier address to\r\nthe General Assembly that same morning, was most\r\nprofound and inspiring.\r\nBrutally murdered in the very prime of his young life\r\nand at the pinnacle of his political leadership and\r\nstatesmanship, President Ndadaye had dedicated his life to\r\nthe promotion of democracy and the general well-being of\r\nhis people. He had gained deserved recognition in Africa as\r\na courageous fighter for democratic principles and peaceful\r\ncooperation between peoples and nations. It was in\r\nrecognition of his courage and leadership qualities that, in\r\nBurundi’s first democratic elections on 1 June this year, the\r\npeople of Burundi overwhelmingly mandated Mr. Ndadaye\r\nto lead the country as President.\r\nThe tragedy that has befallen the people of Burundi is\r\nenormous. The bloody and senseless attempted coup and the\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nbrutal and despicable assassination of President Ndadaye and\r\nother democratically elected national leaders are not only\r\nsetbacks for democracy, but have also brought the peace-\r\nloving people of that country perilously close to the brink of\r\ncivil war. The highest tribute we could ever pay to the late\r\nPresident, as well as the most fitting solace we could offer\r\nthe grieving nation of Burundi, would be for the\r\ninternational community to stand solidly behind the people\r\nof Burundi as they close ranks at this tragic hour behind the\r\nlegitimately elected Government to preserve their hard-won\r\ndemocratic gains.\r\nIn that regard, we note with appreciation the dispatch\r\nby the United Nations Secretary-General of a Special Envoy\r\nto Burundi, as well as the efforts of the Secretary General of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity to consult with\r\nneighbouring Heads of State on the best way to restore the\r\nauthority of the legitimate Government of Burundi. We also\r\nnote with appreciation the rapid response of the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World\r\nFood Programme and other relief agencies to the\r\nhumanitarian needs of the people of Burundi.\r\nI should like, therefore, on behalf of the Group of\r\nAfrican States, to reiterate our grief and sorrow at this tragic\r\nloss and to convey to the bereaved families of the President\r\nand the others who lost their lives in this tragedy our deepest\r\nsympathy and condolences.\r\nFinally, I wish to thank Mr. Insanally for allowing us\r\nthis opportunity to share our grief with the people of\r\nBurundi over their irreparable loss, and to pay homage to\r\nthat fine son of Africa, the late President Melchior Ndadaye.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nIndonesia, who will speak on behalf of the Asian Group of\r\nStates.\r\nMr. WISNUMURTI (Indonesia): I have the sad duty\r\nto state, on behalf of the Asian Group of States, that the\r\nmembers of our regional Group have learned with a\r\nprofound sense of sorrow and grief of the passing of\r\nPresident Melchior Ndadaye.\r\nHis untimely death under tragic circumstances has cut\r\nshort a promising career in the service of his country and of\r\nthe continent of Africa. From the early years of his life, he\r\nsaw it as his duty to place himself at the service of his\r\ncountry. Because of his unshakeable faith in freedom,\r\nprogress, democracy and human rights, he enjoyed the\r\nesteem and admiration of his people. He will undoubtedly\r\nleave his mark as a man who served his country with\r\ndevotion and dedication.\r\nOn behalf of the Asian Group, I convey to the\r\nGovernment and people of Burundi and the bereaved family,\r\nthrough the intermediary of the Burundi delegation, our\r\nsincere condolences.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nthe Russian Federation, who will speak on behalf of the\r\nGroup of Eastern European States.\r\nMr. VORONTSOV (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): On behalf of the members of the Eastern\r\nEuropean Group of States, I would like to pay tribute to the\r\ndeceased President of Burundi, Mr. Melchior Ndadaye, who\r\nfell victim to the military coup against the democratically\r\nelected Government of Burundi.\r\nThe criminal acts of violence committed by the\r\nperpetrators of the coup have been unanimously condemned\r\nby the international community.\r\nI ask the delegation of Burundi to convey to the family\r\nof the deceased President and the Government and people of\r\nBurundi our sincere condolences. It is our sincere hope that\r\ndemocracy and constitutional rule will be promptly restored\r\nin Burundi.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on the representative of\r\nCuba, who will speak on behalf of the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean Group of States.\r\nMr. REMÍREZ DE ESTENOZ (Cuba) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): The members of the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean Group of States learned with profound sorrow of\r\nthe death on 21 October of the President of the Republic of\r\nBurundi, Mr. Melchior Ndadaye, and of prominent members\r\nof his Government as a result of a bloody coup d’état in that\r\nfraternal African country.\r\nMay I today, on behalf of the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean Group, express the heartfelt condolences of our\r\nmembers to the people and Government of Burundi, the\r\nmembers of the President’s family and all those others who\r\nwere close to him. We hope that the country can continue\r\nalong the path freely and in a sovereign manner chosen by\r\nits people towards progress, development and well-being.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I next call on the representative of\r\nNew Zealand, who will speak on behalf of the Group of\r\nWestern European and Other States.\r\nMr. KEATING (New Zealand): It was with great\r\nsadness and regret that the delegations of the Group of\r\nWestern European and Other States learned of the tragic\r\ndeath of the President of Burundi, Mr. Melchior Ndadaye.\r\n43rd meeting - Friday, 29 October l993 5\r\nWe recall that just 25 days ago President Ndadaye, the\r\nleader of a democratically elected Government, stood before\r\nthe Assembly at this very podium and offered us his vision\r\nof a peaceful and prosperous Burundi. President Ndadaye\r\nwas a young man, and the vision he offered was a young\r\nman’s vision, of hope, unity and dignity for all people in his\r\ncountry.\r\nHis untimely death, just when real political progress\r\nwas being made in Burundi, leaves us all with a sense of\r\nloss and outrage. We condemn those responsible for the\r\ndeaths of the President and his compatriots, and we hope\r\nthat they will be brought to justice.\r\nOn behalf of the Group of Western European and Other\r\nStates, I should like, on this solemn occasion, to convey our\r\nmost sincere condolences to the bereaved families, to the\r\npeople and the Government of Burundi, and to our\r\ncolleagues in the Burundi delegation.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nthe United States of America as the host country, Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Madeleine Korbel Albright.\r\nMrs. ALBRIGHT (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States, as host country, joins the world in\r\ncondemning the murder of President Ndadaye and other high\r\nGovernment officials. This reprehensible action violates the\r\nmost fundamental principles of law and morality. We\r\nextend our sincere condolences to the late President’s wife\r\nand family and to the families of all those who were killed\r\nor injured, or who have disappeared.\r\nWe are shocked and deeply saddened by the violence\r\nand mounting casualties in Burundi. We urge all sides to\r\nrefrain from violence and to respect the authority of the\r\nelected Government.\r\nThe United States reiterates its demand that those\r\nresponsible for perpetrating the action against the\r\ndemocratically elected Government of Burundi reveal the\r\nwhereabouts and fate of all Government officials and others\r\nwho may have been taken prisoner or who disappeared\r\nduring this action. We support the Government’s right to\r\nprosecute to the fullest extent of the law those responsible\r\nfor murder, rebellion and other offences against the\r\nGovernment and people of Burundi.\r\nWe salute the freely elected Government and the people\r\nof Burundi, who remain committed to consolidating their\r\ncountry’s democracy. The international community is\r\nunanimous in its support of Burundi’s democratic transition\r\nand will condemn any attempt to reverse it.\r\nWe are encouraged by the recent signs that the coup\r\nattempt is collapsing. Prime Minister Kinigi and other\r\nmembers of the cabinet have taken important measures to\r\nreassert control over the country. We applaud the bravery of\r\nthe Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and other\r\nGovernment officials who have persevered throughout the\r\ncrisis and are now working to consolidate the Government’s\r\ncontrol over the situation.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of\r\nBurundi, His Excellency Mr. Therénce Sinunguruza,\r\nPermanent Representative of Burundi.\r\nMr. SINUNGURUZA (Burundi) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The tragic circumstances that so recently brought\r\nsorrow to my country lead me to speak today in this forum,\r\nwhere you have just paid a final tribute to a man who, only\r\nthree weeks ago and from this very rostrum, conveyed to\r\nyou a message of peace, unity and democracy from the\r\npeople of Burundi.\r\nI should like in turn to carry out that duty. But before\r\nso doing, may I first of all thank most sincerely, on behalf\r\nof the people of Burundi, of my Government and on my\r\nown behalf, all those who have supported us and continue to\r\nsupport us during the tribulations forced upon us by a\r\nmilitary group intent on achieving their own self-interest by\r\nany means possible.\r\nYes, indeed! The Assembly stood together in silence\r\njust now to condemn this putsch and the assassination of our\r\nPresident, and the people of Burundi are deeply grateful for\r\nthis tribute.\r\nI thank most particularly those who spoke on behalf of\r\ntheir organizations and of their Member States for the\r\nsympathy and support they expressed to my people, who are\r\ngoing through a very difficult period. I also thank the\r\nSecurity Council for the swiftness with which it reacted to\r\nthe situation in my country and for its crystal-clear\r\ndeclaration to those who were usurping the sovereignty of\r\nour people. We are certain that assistance from the\r\ninternational community will help us quickly to restore peace\r\nand stability in Burundi.\r\nThe enemies of peace have struck, and they have struck\r\nwith great force. His Excellency Mr. Melchior Ndadaye\r\nwas the first President of the Republic of Burundi\r\ndemocratically elected by the people. The Assembly has just\r\npaid a final tribute to him, and for this I should like to thank\r\nthe Members wholeheartedly. His most earnest desire was\r\nthat the people of Burundi might finally be shielded from\r\nethnic confrontation, so that not one more drop of blood\r\nmight be shed. But alas, he did not know that the enemies\r\nof peace, unity and democracy were going to begin by\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nshedding his own blood and that this brutal and outrageous\r\nact would entail great loss of human life.\r\nBy sacrificing himself, he has become a martyr for\r\ndemocracy. \"Never again\" - the phrase he spoke from this\r\nrostrum only 17 days before his tragic passing - will give\r\npause to many peace-loving Burundians for a long time.\r\nAnd today, I say, \"Enough of this!\" We must finally put an\r\nend to the cycle of tragedies which have struck my country.\r\nIndeed, the consequences of this putsch were such that\r\nthe old demons of division have arisen again just when we\r\nthought that they had finally been relegated to the trash heap\r\nof history. Ethnic violence is currently ravaging the\r\ncountryside of Burundi. People are seeking refuge in\r\nwretched and unsafe areas, and a great many of them have\r\nfled to neighbouring countries. The number of displaced\r\npersons and refugees is now estimated at 400,000.\r\nThough irreparable harm has already been done, the\r\ninternational community must now help us put a stop to this\r\ncarnage. This requires the restoration and protection of the\r\nconstitutional order resulting from the June elections.\r\nMy Government, which is prepared to take things in\r\nhand once again, nevertheless requires a minimum of\r\nsecurity. Indeed, it can no longer trust its army, which rose\r\nup one fine morning to shoot down an innocent President\r\nwithout any apparent reason. That is why the international\r\ncommunity must understand the appeal made by my\r\nGovernment for an international force to come to Burundi to\r\nensure the security of political and democratic authorities, to\r\nrestore peace and security to our population and to help in\r\nthe return and resettlement of displaced persons and\r\nrefugees. We have no doubt that this community, already\r\naware of the situation in my country, will not fail to give us\r\nits full support.\r\nWe also would like to avail ourselves of this\r\nopportunity to appeal to all States Members of the United\r\nNations, to international organizations and to\r\nnon-governmental organizations to lend my country\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance for displaced persons and\r\nrefugees.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ndadaye has just been assassinated\r\non the battlefield of democracy. He therefore deserves to be\r\ncalled a hero of democracy in Burundi.\r\nFor all those who wish to address their written\r\ncondolences to my people, our Permanent Mission has\r\nopened a register for that purpose. To all those who have\r\nalready done so, I would like to convey my gratitude.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 11.25 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11.50 a.m.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The result of the voting for the\r\nelection of five non-permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil is as follows:\r\nGroup A - African and Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 176\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 176\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of Members voting: 176\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 118\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nOman 174\r\nRwanda 153\r\nNigeria 99\r\nGuinea-Bissau 82\r\nBurundi 2\r\nGroup B - Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 176\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 176\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of Members voting: 175\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 117\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nCzech Republic 113\r\nBelarus 62\r\nGroup C - Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 176\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 175\r\nAbstentions: 5\r\nNumber of Members voting: 170\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 114\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nArgentina 169\r\nHonduras 1\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority, the\r\nfollowing States were elected non-permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council for a two-year period beginning\r\n1 January 1994: Argentina, Oman and Rwanda.\r\n43rd meeting - Friday, 29 October l993 7\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I congratulate the States which have\r\nbeen elected non-permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nSince two seats remain to be filled, one from the\r\nAfrican and Asian States and one from the Eastern European\r\nStates, we shall now proceed to the first restricted ballot.\r\nThis second round of balloting shall be restricted to\r\nthose two States from among the African and Asian States\r\nthat were not elected but obtained the largest number of\r\nvotes in the previous ballot, namely Guinea-Bissau and\r\nNigeria; and to those two States from among the Eastern\r\nEuropean States that were not elected but obtained the\r\nlargest number of votes in the previous ballot, namely\r\nBelarus and the Czech Republic.\r\nThis is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of\r\nprocedure.\r\nBallot papers marked \"A\" and \"B\" will now be\r\ndistributed.\r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers\r\nmarked \"A\", for the African and Asian States, the name of\r\nthe State for which they want to vote, and to write on the\r\nballot papers marked \"B\", for the Eastern European States,\r\nthe name of the State for which they want to vote.
