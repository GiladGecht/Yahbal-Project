In my statement to the General \r\nAssembly last year I noted that we are at last moving into \r\na world in which fewer resources will be used for miIitaty \r\npurposes, including nuclear arsenals. Even though many \r\nnew and serious problems face mankind - for instance, \r\nenvironmental threats - we seem to stand on the threshold \r\nof an era in which “Atoms for Peace” can at last achieve \r\nits full meaning: an era in which many nuclear techniques \r\nmay be ,disseminated, especially for the benefit of the \r\ndeveloping world; an era in which a wider use of nuclear \r\npower may help to reduce some of the environmental \r\nthreats to mankind; an era in which we may even begin to \r\nthink seriously about how to organize a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free world. \r\nLet me develop these themes, The objective of \r\nsustainable development was endorsed by the Rio \r\nConference on Environment and Development, and \r\noutlined in Agenda 2 1. Nuclear techniques have much to \r\ncontribute to this objective. The IAEA, as the central \r\nintergovernmental mechanism in the nuclear sphere, can \r\nplay an important role - and not only in the areas of safe \r\ngeneration of energy and the safe disposal of radioactive \r\nwaste, It can also facilitate the transfer of nuclear \r\nThis record is subject to correction. \r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned \r\nlvilhin one lveek of /he dclfe ofpubkafion to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section, \r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record. \r\nDistr. GENERAL \r\nAf4XIPV.45 \r\n22 November 1993 \r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum, \r\n93-87036 (E) ENGLISH ‘5 \r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session \r\ntechniques to promote health, to ensure greater availability \r\nof tiesh water and to secure important data on the \r\natmosphere and the seas. \r\nThe IAEA is the only organization in the United \r\nNations system operating its own laboratories, which have \r\nresearch and analytical capabilities that can be used - and \r\nare used - for environmental protection and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, Thus our laboratory in Seibersdorf, outside \r\nVienna, is helping institutes in Africa to use nuclear \r\ntechniques for conducting element analysis in air, water, \r\nsoil and biological samples. Our Marine Environment \r\nLaboratory in Monaco, inter aliu, supports and helps \r\nmarine laboratories in developing countries by providing \r\nexpertise and training. This work forms an integral part of \r\nthe Oceans and Coastal Areas Programme of the United \r\nNations Environment Programme. \r\nAgenda 21 recognizes that although energy is vital for \r\ngrowth, its generation and use can be sources of \r\nenvironmental degradation. The Agenda therefore calls for \r\nthe design aud implementation of environmentally sound \r\nenergy strategies. This task will not be an easy one. All \r\nforms of energy generation and use entail some risks to \r\nhealth and to the environment. We shall need to aim at a \r\nmix of energy sources and ways of using them that \r\nminimize these risks. In the context of the Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, Governments are now \r\nstarring to make commitments to stabilize carbon dioxide \r\nemissions, which are linked to the uses of all fossil fuels. \r\nHowever, we are still far from formulating national and \r\ninternational energy policies that take into account all the \r\nimplications of various energy choices. \r\nTo start with, we need more hard data about these \r\nimplications. To obtain such data, the IAEA has for some \r\nyears been engaged with other organizations in a project on \r\ndatabases and methodologies for the comparative \r\nassessment of the health and environmental consequences \r\nof different ways of generating electricity. The IAEA also \r\ncontributes towards the process in which the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (1PCC) is \r\nassessing the potential of nuclear power for mitigating \r\ngreenhouse emissions. It is worth noting that most of the \r\nscenarios for fbture energy policies which lead to \r\nsubstantial reductions in global carbon-dioxide emissions \r\ncontain a significant component of nuclear power. \r\nAgenda 21 devotes a whole chapter to the \r\nenvironmentally sound management of radioactive wastes, \r\nreflecting the importance which the international \r\ncommunity attaches to this issue. Agenda 21 encourages \r\nsupport for the IAEA’s activities in this regard, especially \r\nin strengthening the capacity of developing countries in the \r\nfield of sound nuclear-waste management. Much is being \r\ndone within the IAEA to promote safe disposal of nuclear \r\nwastes - for instance, information exchange, expert \r\nassistance, advice and services in specific cases and work \r\non establishing international norms. While non-binding \r\nradioactive-waste safety standards already exist, work is \r\nexpected before long on a binding convention on the safe \r\nmanagement and disposal of radioactive wastes. \r\n? \r\nLet me also mention in this connection that under the \r\nso-called London Dumping Convention the IAEA provides \r\nthe technical basis for norms relating to the disposal of I \r\nradioactive materials at sea. A moratorium on such \r\ndisposal was recommended in 1985, and next month the ’ \r\nContracting Parties to the Convention will take a decision :I \r\non whether to replace that moratorium with a complete \r\nban. \r\nAs is well known, some sea disposal of radioactive \r\nwaste has occurred despite the recommended moratorium ’ \r\nand has caused concern. During 1992 and 1993 the IAEA 2 \r\ntook various initiatives to evaluate the potential impact of ,. \r\nand possible remedial action with regard to 3 \r\nradioactive-waste dumping in the Kara and Barents Seas. G \r\nIn cooperation with the Governments of Russia and \r\nNorway, the Agency, through its Monaco Marine i \r\nLaboratory, took part in the sea expeditions organized by \r\nthese two countries. An analysis of the environmental \r\nsamples collected to date indicates that the present levels \r\nof radioactivity in the area of the dump sites are low. AS \r\na follow-up, the Agency initiated the International Arctic \r\nSeas Assessment Project to make a full evaluation of the \r\npossible health and environmental impact of radioactive :- \r\nwastes dumped in the shallow waters of the Arctic. The \r\nIAEA has declared that it is also ready to help assess the \r\npotential impact of the radioactive waste dumped in the \r\nNorth Pacific, including the Sea of Japan. The latest of \r\nthese dumping actions took place very recently. \r\nI should like to turn now to the safety of nuclear \r\npower. The efforts of the IAEA to develop not only \r\nrecommendations but legally binding safety standards for \r\nnuclear-power plants have continued. I am glad to report \r\nto the Assembly that there is now a consensus about the \r\nstructure and main contents of a nuclear safety convention. \r\nThe scope of the convention would be limited to civil r \r\nnuclear-power reactors. An important feature would be an i. \r\nobligation of the parties to report at agreed intervals to a \r\nmeeting of contracting parties on the national application i \r\nof safety principles laid down in the convention. That \r\nreporting would be linked to a system of international peer \r\nreview. It is hoped that the convention will be approved \r\nwithin the next year. ? \r\nThe IAEA continues to assist in seeking to mitigate @’ \r\nthe consequences of the disaster at Chernobyl in 1986. It I \r\nk \r\n45th meeting - Monday, 1 November 1993 3 \r\nparticipates in the Inter-Agency Task Force established by \r\nthe United Nations under the chairmanship of \r\nUnder-Secretary-General Eliasson. One very successful \r\nproject has been to give cattle in the area affected by the \r\nnuclear fall-out from the Chernobyl accident a compound \r\ncalled Prussian blue, which radically and safely reduces \r\nradio-caesium contamination in meat and in milk. In \r\naddition, since the accident - and as a result of far-reaching \r\nchanges in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe - \r\nmajor efforts are under way to upgrade the safety of \r\nnuclear installations in this region. Assistance is offered \r\nby the G-24 Group of countries members of the \r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development \r\n(OECD), by the Commission of the European Communities \r\nand by the World Association of Nuclear Operators. The \r\nIAEA focuses its assistance on implementing consistent \r\ninternational safety assessments and on making \r\nrecommendations regarding the most urgently needed \r\nsafety improvements. Some improvements in the safety of \r\nthese facilities are now achieved as a result of the \r\nconsiderable work undertaken by all concerned - mostly, of \r\ncourse, by the countries in the region themselves. \r\nIn conjunction with the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP), the IAEA has taken a further \r\ninitiative to strengthen radiation protection and nuclear \r\nsafety infrastructures in the States of the former Soviet \r\nUnion. \r\nI should now like to discuss how the IAEA can meet \r\nseveral new challenges it may be asked to take on in the \r\nfield of security in the post-cold-war period. \r\nIn his message to the thirty-seventh General \r\nConference of the IAEA the Secretary-General noted that, \r\nalthough the post-cold-war world is in some respects a \r\nsafer one, it is also considerably more complicated. There \r\ncould be a development that eventually leads all nations to \r\ndo away with nuclear weapons, but there are also some \r\nnew risks for a development in the opposite direction, that \r\nis to say, a spread of such weapons to further countries. \r\nThe most important measures to prevent horizontal \r\nproliferation lie in the fields of security policy, in the \r\ncreation of international and regional relations such that the \r\nincentive to acquire nuclear weapons disappears, It is, \r\nfurther, of crucial importance that the renunciation of \r\nnuclear weapons by each State be reliable. If it is not so \r\nperceived, there may remain incentives for other States to \r\nacquire such weapons. It is to give the greatest possible \r\nassurance that non-proliferation commitments are respected \r\nand reliable that IAEA verification safeguards are \r\ndemanded and accepted by non-nuclear-weapon States. \r\nIn a world of nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation, a world of fewer nuclear weapons, there \r\nis need to feel confident both that non-nuclear-weapon \r\nStates are not violating their non-proliferation \r\ncommitments and that States legally committed to \r\ndismantle nuclear weapons do not secretly produce new \r\nweapons. The key to confidence-building is full nuclear \r\ntransparency. The IAEA safeguards, particularly when \r\napplied to a State’s complete nuclear-fuel cycle, are an \r\ninstrument to create such transparency. Not surprisingly, \r\nconsidering the political and security significance of the \r\nreliability of non-proliferation commitments, some of the \r\nAgency’s safeguards and verification activities have been \r\nat the forefront of political and media attention during the \r\npast year. I shall describe these activities in a moment. \r\nHowever, no rational assessment of the Agency’s \r\nsafeguards system or activities is possible without a \r\nrealistic understanding of what they can and cannot do. \r\nSafeguards inspectors are not a supranational police \r\nforce that can parachute into a country and stop \r\nproliferation. They are inspectors who verify the \r\ncorrectness and completeness of State declarations about \r\nnuclear material and installations. Their reports, if \r\nreassuring, may create confidence and detente. If alarming, \r\nthey may trigger action by the international community. \r\nPower to take collective action - diplomatic, economic or \r\nmilitary - is vested in the Security Council, and it is to that \r\nbody, in accordance with its Statute and its llelationship \r\nAgreement with the United Nations, that the IAEA will \r\nhave to turn if its safeguards verifications point to acts of \r\nproliferation or if there is non-compliance with safeguards \r\nobligations. \r\nThe revelations about Iraq’s undeclared nuclear \r\nactivities highlighted the fact that in practice safeguards \r\nactivities had been limited to declared nuclear material and \r\ndeclared installations. Following the experience of Iraq, \r\nthe international community aIso looks for assurance about \r\nthe non-existence of undeclared nuclear material and \r\ninstallations in States that have comprehensive safeguards. \r\nIt looks to the IAEA safeguards to provide such assurance, \r\nin so far as it is possible. This has led to considerable \r\nefforts in the IAEA to strengthen the Agency’s capacity to \r\ndetect nuclear material and installations that should have \r\nbeen, but were not, declared. \r\nInspectors cannot go in blind search of undeclared \r\nnuclear material and installations. They must have \r\ninformation about where to go and what to ask. The \r\nsingle most important factor for building a capacity to find \r\npossibly existing non-declared material and installations is \r\nfor the Agency to have access to information. \r\nAccordingly, measures are taken to strengthen the \r\nAgency ’ s information base - for instance, regarding \r\nexports and imports of nuclear material and relevant \r\nequipment. iHowever, all available safeguards-relevant \r\n4 General Assembly I Forty-eighth session \r\ninformation must be scrutinized and analysed critically. \r\nThere exists much erroneous information, and the Agency \r\nmust seek to avoid false alarms, It is obvious that the \r\nmore thorough and comprehensive the Agency’s \r\nverification activities are, the more confidence and \r\nassurances they can provide. Fortunately, several new \r\ntechniques and approaches, such as environmental \r\nmonitoring, are emerging that may be used to give \r\nsafeguards the greater detection capacity now asked for. \r\nThese techniques and approaches will need to be tested, \r\nassessed thoroughly and accepted before they can be \r\nbroadly used and relied on. \r\nThe central safeguards issue relating to the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea is that IAEA verification \r\nactivities in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nsuggest that some nuclear material exists there which has \r\nnot been reported to the Agency. Hence, the Agency \r\ncannot verify the correctness and assess the completeness \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s report of \r\nmaterial subject to safeguards. The Agency has not \r\nasserted that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is \r\ndiverting nuclear material for weapons development. \r\nHowever, until such time as the inconsistency between the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea’s report and the \r\nAgency’s findings is satisfactorily resolved through \r\nadditional information and visits to additional locations, the \r\npossibility that nuclear material has been diverted cannot \r\nbe excluded. \r\nOne would expect that a Government faced with \r\nquestions relevant to safeguards implementation would go \r\nout of its way promptly to provide the IAEA with \r\nclarification. Regrettably, so far, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea has instead been seeking to restrict \r\nIAEA safeguards verification, thereby reducing \r\ntransparency. Thus, the area of non-compliance with the \r\nComprehensive Safeguards Agreement has been widening, \r\nAs a result, a number of verification measures of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea’s declared nuclear \r\nactivities have become overdue and the continuity of some \r\nsafeguards-relevant data has been damaged. \r\nThe longer the Agency is precluded from conducting \r\ninspection, the more safeguards-related data deteriorate and \r\nthe less assurance safeguards can provide that even the \r\ndeclared facilities are used exclusively for peaceful \r\npurposes. For its part, the Agency is ready to conduct \r\ninspection of the nuclear installations and material which \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has declared \r\nand submitted to safeguards, However, the inspection \r\nactivities are an integral whole. They are not a set of \r\nactivities from which an inspected State can pick and \r\nchoose. The Agency is also ready to consult with the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea on all outstanding \r\nsafeguards issues, including the question of the inspection \r\nof non-declared sites and additional information. \r\nTo conclude my comments on the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, only the practice of full \r\nnuclear transparency, including full implementation of \r\nIAEA safeguards, can create the confidence that the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear activities \r\nare devoted exclusively to peaceful purposes. I \r\nWhen a State joining the safeguards system has many \r\nnuclear installations and much nuclear material, it is ? \r\nalways difficult to verify that everything has been I \r\ndeclared. However, the Agency’s activities in South \r\nAfrica show that such difficulties can be successfully i \r\ntackled through the sustained efforts of the IAEA and a \r\nhigh degree of cooperation and transparency by the \r\ninspected party. Since September 1991, when South i \r\nAfrica concluded its Comprehensive Safeguards i \r\nAgreement with the IAEA, 22 IAEA safeguards missions ! \r\nhave visited South Africa, Many apparent discrepancies ’ \r\nand inconsistencies which were earlier identified have ‘5 \r\nbeen resolved. No reason has been found to doubt the { \r\nveracity of South Africa’s initial declaration. \r\nA new dimension was added when President De Klerk ! \r\ndeclared that South Africa had developed a nuclear- \r\nweapons capability but had destroyed it totally before \r\nacceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons. The Agency was invited to examine that the \r\nprogramme had in fact been terminated and that all the \r\nnuclear material had been placed under safeguards. A \r\nteam of Agency staff and nuclear-weapons experts visited 1. \r\nSouth Africa for these purposes in April, June and August \r\nthis year. It found no indication casting doubt on South \r\nAfrica’s statement that all the highly enriched uranium \r\nfrom weapons had been reported in its initial declaration, \r\nFor the past two and a half years, the IAEA has \r\ndevoted much effort to fulfilling the mandate laid down in \r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991) relating to Iraq, \r\nSome 21 inspection missions sent by the IAEA and \r\nconsiderable staff work in Vienna have enabled us to \r\nconclude that, in all essential aspects, Iraq’s clandestine \r\nnuclear-weapons programme has been mapped and either \r\ndestroyed or neutralized. Declared, non-irradiated highly \r\nenriched uranium was removed from Iraq in November I \r\n1991 and a schedule has been established for the removal , \r\nof declared, irradiated highly enriched uranium, When this \r\nactivity is complete, no highly enriched uranium and no ’ \r\ncapacity to produce it should remain in Iraq. \r\nf \r\nThere are still some gaps in our knowledge of Iraq’s $ \r\nnuclear supply and procurement channels and about k \r\n45th meeting - Monday, 1 November 1993 5 \r\nsources of scientific and technical information We hope \r\nthat, on the basis of documentation very recently made \r\navailable by Iraq, the last pieces of this picture will soon \r\nbe clarified in a way which will contribute towards full and \r\neffective long-term monitoring. This will be essential to \r\ngive assurance that Iraq does not seek to reacquire \r\nproscribed nuclear capability. In recent discussions in New \r\nYork with the Iraqi side, the IAEA and the United Nations \r\nSpecial Commission have clarified how ongoing \r\nmonitoring and verification are to be pursued. Such \r\nmonitoring will not, of course, preclude the Agency from \r\nusing the extensive rights of inspection in Iraq approved \r\nby the Security Council, should it need to do so. \r\nOn the basis of preparations carried out over the past \r\nyear, the Agency has phased in, on a de facto basis, \r\ncertain elements of its ongoing monitoring and verification \r\nplan provided for in Security Council resolution 715 \r\n(199 I), a mandatory resolution that is automatically \r\nbinding on all Member States. The approach which has \r\nbeen followed will allow the Agency to move into full and \r\nformal implementation of the plan at an early stage and \r\nthus accelerate the implementation of the Security Council \r\nresolutions, in so far as they relate to Iraq’s nuclear \r\ncapacity, \r\nHowever, as I reported recently to the Security \r\nCouncil, before the IAEA can report that, in its view, Iraq \r\nhas complied with the requirements of paragraphs 11, 12 \r\nand 13 of section C of resolution 687 (1991), Iraq must \r\nformally acknowledge its obligations under Security \r\nCouncil resolution 715 (1991) and the plan approved \r\nthereunder, and the IAEA must satisfy itself that it is in a \r\nposition tilly to implement the plan. The IAEA must also \r\nverify to its satisfaction recent information provided by \r\nIraq on suppliers. \r\nI will now touch on some areas in which we’can be \r\nsure that IAEA safeguards activities will expand and on \r\nsome others where such expansion is possible. A good \r\nexample of mutual openness and confidence-building in \r\nnuclear activities has been set by Argentina and Brazil. \r\nIncreasing cooperation in the nuclear sphere between the \r\ntwo countries over the past decade culminated in 1991 in \r\nthe Guadalajara Agreement on the Exclusively Peaceful \r\nUtilization of Nuclear Energy. This Agreement was \r\nsupplemented by a quadripartite safeguards agreement \r\nwhich was signed in Vienna in December 1991 between \r\nArgentina, Brazil, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for \r\nAccounting and Control of Nuclear Materials and the \r\nIAEA. \r\nUnder this latter agreement, comprehensive IAEA \r\nsafeguards will be implemented in the two countries. I am \r\npleased to note that the Argentine parliament approved the \r\nsafeguards agreement last year, and the Lower House of \r\nthe Brazilian Congress has recently approved it. The \r\napplication of comprehensive IAEA safeguards will by no \r\nmeans raise any obstacles to peaceful nuclear development \r\nin the two countries. Rather, it is likely to remove some \r\nobstacles to wider international cooperation. \r\nIt could also soon lead to the entry into force of the \r\nTreaty of Tlatelolco. Latin America’s becoming \r\neffectively a nuclear-weapon-free zone would be a major \r\nevent, and would strengthen nuclear non-proliferation \r\nefforts generally. \r\nI have already spoken about the Agency’s verification \r\nactivities in South Africa. The positive developments in \r\nSouth Africa may also lead to the conclusion of a Treaty \r\nmaking the whole African continent a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone. The Agency is working closely with the United \r\nNations-Organization of African Unity Group of Experts \r\nentrusted with the drafting of an African \r\nnuclear-weapon-free-zone treaty. \r\nIn the Middle East, the peace process has passed a \r\ndifficult hurdle. If the process accelerates, the prospects \r\nfor a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other \r\nweapons of mass destruction may increase. Support by the \r\nparties to the peace process for the concept of such a zone \r\nis firm. \r\nAgainst the background of the many past conflicts and \r\nthe deep distrust between the parties in the Middle East, \r\nthere is naturally much interest in considering how, and by \r\nwhat means, effective verification of a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone can be achieved and how guarantees can be created \r\nfor early warning of any violations, should they occur. \r\nThere appears to be a general understanding, between the \r\nregional parties, of the need for comprehensive and \r\nfar-reaching verification in a future nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone. \r\nAnother important confidence-building measure would \r\nbe the development of active cooperation between the \r\nparties, in the nuclear field, in an open and transparent \r\nmanner, \r\nIn pursuance of a mandate placed upon me by a \r\nresolution of the IAEA’s General Conference, I have been \r\nconsulting States of the Middle East region with a view, \r\ninter ah, to facilitating the early application of full-scope \r\nAgency safeguards to all nuclear activities in that region. \r\nIn a further resolution, the General Conference added the \r\nrequest that the Director General should provide whatever \r\nassistance might be requested by the parties in the Middle \r\nEast in support of the multilateral efforts of the peace \r\nprocess. I shall certainly respond to any such request. \r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session \r\nIn his statement to the General Assembly of the \r\nUnited Nations on 27 September this year, President \r\nClinton spoke about steps to control the materials needed \r\nfor nuclear weapons production, to address issues related \r\nto growing global stockpiles of plutonium and highly \r\nenriched uranium, and to encourage all nuclear weapon \r\nStates to refrain from nuclear testing and to begin \r\nnegotiations towards a comprehensive test-ban treaty. In \r\nareas such as these, roles may be assigned to the IAEA \r\nwhich, while consistent with its mandate, would go beyond \r\nits traditional safeguards functions. \r\nCurrent nuclear disarmament measures, as well as \r\ncurrent reprocessing of spent civilian nuclear fuel, will lead \r\nto substantial quantities of plutonium and highly enriched \r\nuranium - that is to say, materials usable for nuclear \r\nweapons -which will have to be safely and securely stored \r\nbefore they are put to peaceful use or otherwise disposed \r\nof. Concerns about the safety and security of such \r\nmaterials might be alleviated by devising specific \r\nconfidence-building measures which States could enter into \r\neither unilaterally or multilaterally. The IAEA has initiated \r\nsome preliminary work in seeking to identify some of the \r\nproblems and possible methods for managing plutonium \r\nand highly enriched uranium. \r\nA verified cut-off for the production of plutonium and \r\nhighly enriched uranium for weapons or other explosive \r\npurposes has been under international discussion for many \r\nyears. However, the present international climate gives \r\ngrounds for hope that that discussion could lead to an \r\nagreement involving all States on an equal basis. The \r\nverification arrangements needed to underpin such an \r\nagreement would entail great challenges, having necessarily \r\nto focus on the largest and most complex of nuclear \r\ninstallations, that is to say, enrichment and reprocessing \r\nplants. \r\nMethods and techniques of verification exist, but \r\nmight have to be further developed. Should IAEA \r\nsafeguards be applied to the operation or dismantling of all \r\ninstallations capable ofproducing weapons-usable material, \r\nthe added verification workload - and the resources needed \r\nfor it - would be significant. The value of a cut-off \r\nagreement would also be very significant. \r\nAmong the arms control measures now under \r\ndiscussion is an agreement on a complete ban on any kind \r\nof nuclear explosive testing. It has been suggested that the \r\nIAEA might be given a central role in verifying \r\ncompliance with such agreement, including the \r\nmanagement of an international data centre and the conduct \r\nof on-site inspections. The Agency has some experience \r\nand expertise in the field of seismic measurements, the \r\nmain verification method under consideration, as well as in \r\nother relevant areas. I am confident that, with some added \r\ncapacity, the IAEA would be able to perform verification \r\ntasks under a test-ban treaty, if entrusted with so doing, \r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, in \r\n1995, will also mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT). The NPT continues to provide a solid framework \r\nfor global nuclear non-proliferation endeavours, side by \r\nside with the other multilateral treaties on the subject. \r\nIn the presidential statement made at the Summit \r\nMeeting of 31 January 1992, the Security Council \r\nemphasized, inter \u0026a, the integral role of effective IAEA \r\nsafeguards in the implementation of the non-proliferation \r\nTreaty: There is little doubt that the most important \r\ncontributions which the Agency can make to the NPT are \r\nto continue to strengthen the effectiveness, efficiency and \r\ncredibility of the safeguards applied under the Treaty, to \r\ncontinue to facilitate the transfer of nuclear technology for \r\npeaceful purposes as prescribed by the Treaty, and to \r\nextend safeguards effectively to the new Parties to the \r\nTreaty. \r\nIn anticipation of the adherence of States of the \r\nformer Soviet Union to the NPT, much preparatory work \r\nhas been undertaken for the introduction of comprehensive \r\nsafeguards in those States. Individual States members of \r\nthe IAEA and the IAEA secretariat have helped to provide \r\ninformation and equipment to facilitate the establishment \r\nof effective national systems of nuclear accountancy and \r\ncontrol. Actual implementation of safeguards must, \r\nhowever, await, the conclusion of formal safeguards \r\nagreements. To date, only one such agreement has come \r\ninto force, namely, with Lithuania. \r\n.I should like to conclude with some brief comments \r\nrelating to the Agency’s finances, programme and \r\npersonnel. The Agency’s financial situation remains \r\nprecarious. Crises have been avoided only because \r\nsubstantial shortfalls in budgetary contributions to our \r\nactivities have been met by curtailing or deferring some \r\nactivities. When resources are so scarce, it is particularly \r\nimportant that they be used in a way which reflects the \r\nAgency’s dual functions in a balanced and equitable \r\nmanner. \r\nThe community of States must not lose out by default \r\non this era of opportunity and challenge. The IAEA stands \r\nready to perform a verification role in a number of vital \r\narms-control and disarmament measures which may now \r\nbecome possible. However, the Agency must be given \r\nadequate resources to perform new tasks. Without such \r\nreSOWCeS, limits will inevitably be placed on its ability to \r\nmatch UP to the high expectations that are placed upon it. \r\n45th meeting - Monday, 1 November 1993 I \r\nAustria is an excellent host to all the international \r\norganizations located in Vienna, and I should like to finish \r\nthis statement by expressing before the Assembly the \r\nthanks of the IAEA to the Government of Austria. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I thank Mr. Blix for his \r\nintroduction to the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency, and I congratulate him on his \r\nreappointment as Director General of the Agency. \r\nI now call on the representative of Australia to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/48/L.13 and Corr.1. \r\nMr. O’SULLIVAN (Australia): I would like to \r\nintroduce, on behalf of a wide and representative group of \r\nsponsors, draft resolution A/48/L. 13 and Corr.1, adopting \r\nthe annua1 report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA). The sponsors are Afghanistan, Albania, \r\nArgentina, Australia, Belgium, Bhutan, Bulgaria, Canada, \r\nColombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, \r\nDenmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Fiji, Finland, France, the \r\nGambia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, \r\nJapan, Lesotho, Liberia, Luxembourg, the Marshall Islands, \r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia, the Netherlands, New \r\nZealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Papua New Guinea, \r\nPoland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the \r\nRussian Federation, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, \r\nSolomon Islands, Spain, Sweden, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine, the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United \r\nStates of America and Venezuela, Australia, which has the \r\nhonour of chairing the IAEA Board of Governors this year, \r\nis introducing the draft resolution in accordance with the \r\ntradition that a representative of the Board of Governors \r\nBureau introduces the draft resolution on the report of the \r\nIAEA in the General Assembly, \r\nI note that it is the understanding of the sponsors of \r\nthe draft resolution, which is traditionally developed in \r\nVienna before being forwarded to the General Assembly, \r\nthat it is not the role of delegations in New York to amend \r\nwhat has been agreed in Vienna. In line with this role, in \r\norder not to compromise the negotiating efforts of our \r\ncolleagues in Vienna and to avoid opening a Pandora’s box \r\nof conflicting suggestions, the sponsors believe that \r\namendments to the draft resolution should not be accepted, \r\nsince none were agreed in Vienna. That is, the sponsors \r\ndo not wish to assume a negotiating role independent of \r\nthe Vienna structures. Were we to do so, we would make \r\na complex and sensitive situation even more difficult. \r\nTurning now to the report of the IAEA itself, 1 should \r\nlike to express appreciation to the Director General, Mr. \r\nHans Blix, for his detailed and comprehensive statement \r\nintroducing the annual report on the operation of the \r\nAgency in 1992. \r\nAs one of the founding members, Australia has long \r\nbeen an active supporter of the Agency, which remains an \r\norganization of critical importance to the international \r\ncommunity. In the new world situation, the IAEA \r\ncontinues to play a vital role in fostering global peace and \r\nsecurity and in promoting cooperation on the peaceful uses \r\nof nuclear energy. \r\nThe Director General and his staff deserve to be \r\ncommended for their tireless efforts and personal devotion \r\nto the tasks of adapting the Agency to the fundamental \r\nchanges and of responding adequately to the new \r\nchallenges of our time. \r\nAustralia considers the annual report of the IAEA as \r\na successful attempt to present a comprehensive and \r\nwell-balanced analysis of the Agency’s activities in 1992. \r\nThe report clearly demonstrates that the Agency has \r\ncontinued to fir181 its responsibilities, as provided for in its \r\nstatute and in the resolutions of the General Conference \r\nand the Board of Governors. \r\nAustralia participated in the process of detailed \r\nconsideration and adoption of decisions related to IAEA \r\nactivities during the period covered by its report. My \r\ndelegation endorses this report, as it faithfully reflects the \r\nAgency’s efforts to strengthen its safeguards system, to \r\nimprove the scope and the effectiveness of its \r\nnuclear-safety and nuclear-cooperation programmes, and to \r\nserve as a major source of technical assistance to Member \r\nStates. \r\nThe past year has been an important one for the \r\nIAEA, New developments in disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation have had, and will continue to have, \r\nsignificant ramifications for the Agency: South Africa, in \r\nabandoning its nuclear-weapon status, has given a number \r\nof important verification tasks to the Agency; there are \r\nstrong positive indications that Latin America and Africa \r\nmay soon become nuclear-weapon-free continents; progress \r\nin the Middle East peace process may increase the \r\nprospects of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that region; and \r\nthe development of agreements on a comprehensive \r\ntest-ban treaty and an a cessation of the production of \r\nfissionable material for weapons purposes could have \r\nimplications for the IAEA in terms of possible \r\ninternational verification mechanisms, \r\nWe are pleased also that the General Assembly \r\nlaunched the preparatory process for the 1995 Conference \r\non the Extension of the Treaty with the first meeting ofthe \r\nPreparatory Committee in May this year. \r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session \r\nWhile responding effectively to new and positive \r\ndevelopments, it is clear from the report just introduced by \r\nthe Director General that the Agency faces continuing \r\nchallenges relating to the dismantling of Iraq’s near-nuclear \r\nweapons capacity, the existence of nuclear weapons in \r\nsome States of the former Soviet Union and North Korea’s \r\nnon-compliance with its IAEA safeguards obligations. \r\nThe Agency’s safeguards system, together with the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \r\nconstitute the principal international assurance of the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. The safeguards system is \r\nnot only fundamental to nuclear non-proliferation but it \r\nalso underpins nuclear trade and cooperation. The efforts \r\nof the IAEA in the past few years to strengthen and \r\nimprove the effectiveness and transparency of its \r\nsafeguards system are commendable: action has been \r\ntaken to reaffirm the Agency’s right to undertake special \r\ninspections, to obtain earlier provision of design \r\ninformation on nuclear facilities and to establish a more \r\ncomprehensive reporting system on nuclear imports and \r\nexports. New measures have also been proposed by the \r\nStanding Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation \r\n(SAGSI) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the \r\nsafeguards system. \r\nNuclear safety remains a key area of the IAEA’s \r\nwork. Nuclear-safety standards are constantly being \r\ndeveloped and upgraded by the Agency, not least in \r\nresponse to public perceptions concerning the benefits and \r\nrisks associated with nuclear energy. Considerable efforts \r\nhave been devoted in the past year to this field, both in the \r\ndomestic and international spheres. Work has been \r\nundertaken in particular in the former Soviet Union and in \r\nEastern and Central European countries to upgrade the \r\nsafety of nuclear installations, with a specific intiative \r\ntaken by the Agency, together with the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, to strengthen radiation protection \r\nin the States of the former Soviet Union. Also welcome is \r\nthe development of a consensus on the structure of the \r\nmain contents of a nuclear-safety convention. \r\nThe past year has also seen important developments \r\nin the Agency’s technical assistance and cooperation \r\nactivities, with new approaches being followed to increase \r\nthe effective use of the resources available for the \r\nAgency’s technical assistance programme. \r\nTurning now to this year’s drawl resolution, we note \r\nthat it is substantially the same as the resolution adopted \r\nby the General Assembly in 1992. Operative paragraph 4 \r\nwould emphasize the centrality of strengthened safeguards \r\nto international security, regional security and technical \r\ncooperation; operative paragraph 6 wouId highlight the \r\nAgency’s actions in strengthening technical assistance and \r\ncooperation activities; operative paragraph 7 would draw \r\nattention to the impartial efforts of the Director General \r\nand the Secretariat in seeking to implement the safeguards \r\nagreement still in force between the Agency and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, and the \r\nimportance of fill implementation of the safeguards \r\nagreement; and operative paragraph 8 would emphasize \r\nthat the Agency is continuing to do very valuable and \r\ndangerous work in Iraq which, we believe, requires \r\nrecognition by the General Assembly, and that effective \r\nfulfilment of Security Council resolutions is essential for \r\nthe continued effectiveness of the non-proliferation regime \r\nand the assurances that the regime provides to all members \r\nof the international community. \r\nWe commend this draft resolution to delegations. It \r\nhas attracted a broad sponsorship. It is a balanced text and \r\nseeks to be responsive to the needs and interests of all \r\nIAEA members. Importantly, the efforts of the negotiators \r\nin Vienna have been respected through the maintenance of \r\nlanguage adopted by the Board of Governors and by the \r\nGeneral Conference. Above all, we all have a common \r\ninterest - to see the maintenance and strengthening of the \r\nAgency and the protection of its activities which promote \r\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. To support this \r\ndraft resolution is to support that objective. \r\nMr. SUCHARIPA (Austria): As representative of the \r\ncountry that has hosted the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) since its establishment over 36 years ago, \r\nI believe it is appropriate at the outset of my remarks to \r\npay a tribute to the Agency for its continuing excellent \r\nrecord. I also wish to recognize the major contribution the \r\nAgency’s competent and dedicated staff are making to the \r\nhigh profile of the IAEA. \r\nOf course, I avail myself of this occasion also to \r\ncongratulate the Director General, Mr. Hans Blix, on his \r\nreappointment for a fourth term of office, approved by the \r\nrecent session of the Genera1 Conference, We offer him \r\nour best wishes. for further success in his work during the \r\ncoming years. I should also like to express our \r\nappreciation to the Director General for his comprehensive \r\nand forward-looking statement this morning. \r\nSweeping winds of change are starting to penetrate the \r\ntraditional patterns of our post-Second-World-War \r\nthinking. International organizations such as the United \r\nNations, and also those of a more technical character like \r\nthe IAEA, have entered a process of readapting their \r\nagendas to new realities. The margins for resorting to \r\nblueprint solutions have narrowed. This situation poses \r\nnew problems and challenges; it also provides us with \r\nfresh opportunities, which we must seize. \r\n45th meeting - Monday, 1 November 1393 9 \r\nWith those preliminary remarks of a more general \r\nnature in mind, I shal1 now briefly address a number of \r\nissues relating to the work of the Agency from my \r\nGovernment’s perspective. \r\nNuclear safety, including the safe disposal of nuclear \r\nwaste, has been and will continue to be an issue of high \r\npriority for countries such as Austria, which, in the absence \r\nof any significant nuclear activities of their own, \r\nnevertheless see their populations threatened by the \r\nprospect of suffering unbearable damage originating from \r\nthe operation of unsafe nuclear facilities in their immediate \r\nor wider neighbourhood. The bitter lessons learned from \r\nthe Chernobyl accident have, however, taught countries \r\noperating nuclear-power plants that nuclear power is \r\nunlikely to survive a second event of a comparable scale, \r\nThat accident appears to have sharpened safety \r\nconsciousness worldwide. \r\nAt the same time, we note that political changes have \r\nprompted a new level of openness and of sensitivity to \r\nmatters of nuclear safety in the Central and Eastern \r\nEuropean countries, including Russia and the newly \r\nindependant States, While we are filly aware of their \r\npresent economic constraints and their pressing energy \r\ndemands as they head towards market-oriented economies, \r\nwe appeal to these Governments of those countries \r\nseriously to consider non-nuclear power options when \r\nmaking their intermediate- and long-term energy policy \r\nchoices. \r\nIn the meantime, concern among our public remains \r\nhigh with regard to possible hazards, particularly from the \r\ncontinued operation of considerable numbers of reactors of \r\nolder design that are still far from meeting acceptable \r\nmodem safety standards. \r\nIn that context, we acknowledge the major efforts \r\ntowards upgrading the safety of these installations exerted \r\nnationally by operator States. The services offered and the \r\nadvice and assistance given by the IAEA in this context \r\ncontinue to be essential and indispensable. We also hope \r\nthat the substantial coordinated technical and financial \r\nassistance provided by the Governments of leading safety \r\ntechnology holders, bilaterally and multilaterally, will \r\nfurther accelerate the process of redressing the situation. \r\nWe have also taken note with great interest of the \r\nvarious important tasks undertaken by the Agency in \r\nconnection with the implementation of Agenda 21, as \r\noutlined this morning here by the Director General. \r\nProgress recently achieved, after extensive preparatory \r\nexpert work under the leadership of the Agency, towards \r\na nuclear-safety convention gives rise to optimism that a \r\nconvention containing binding safety provisions, although \r\nlimited in scope to civil nuclear-power reactors, could be \r\nagreed upon in 1994. Austria greets this development on \r\nthe understanding that such a step would be followed \r\nwithout delay by negotiations for extending binding safety \r\nprovisions to further sections of the nuclear fuel cycle. \r\nTo our regret, the status of ongoing negotiations for \r\nan improved liability regime for nuclear damage is fw,less \r\npromising, owing to still widely differing views among the \r\ninterested parties. \r\nAustria strongly supports the IAEA’s efforts further to \r\nstrengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the \r\nsafeguards system. Results attained so far, such as the \r\nreassertion of the Agency’s authority to conduct special \r\ninspections and the acceptance of broadened access to \r\nsafeguards-relevant information to give greater assurance \r\nagainst the existence of undeclared nuclear activities are \r\nencouraging steps in the right direction, Further measures \r\nfor reinforcing the system will have to be studied. None \r\nof them, however, can be a substitute for truly universal \r\nadherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and the bonafzde execution of its \r\nfull-scope safeguards provisions by all States. \r\nThe Agency’s safeguards system has proved to be an \r\nimportant verification tool contributing to international \r\narms control efforts, In this regard an expanded role for \r\nthe Agency’s verification functions, extending to areas \r\nwhich only recently have come under substantive \r\ndiscussion, might, as indicated by the Director General in \r\nhis statement, soon become reality - as for example in the \r\ncontext of a future comprehensive test-ban treaty - in the \r\nsafeguarding of fissionable material recovered from \r\nwarheads in the course of the implementation of the \r\nSTART I and START II agreements and in eventual \r\narrangements for a verified end to production of fissionable \r\nmaterial for weapons purposes to complement \r\nnuclear-arms-reduction agreements. \r\nAs we approach the 1995 NPT review and extension \r\nconference, I am gratified to note that, apart from the fact \r\nthat all nuclear-weapon States are now parties, a substantial \r\nnumber of additional non-nuclear-weapon States have in \r\nthe more recent past acceded to the Treaty, bringing it a \r\nstep closer to universality. \r\nWe have noted the decision of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea not to put into effect its earlier \r\nintention to withdraw from the Treaty. With others, we \r\nstrongly appeal to the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea to maintain that position and urgently to resume full \r\ncooperation with the Agency in the execution of the \r\nsafeguards agreement and in resolving outstanding \r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session \r\nsafeguards issues, for its own benefit as well as in the \r\ninterest of security and stability in the region and in the \r\nworld. In that context we want to assure the Agency of \r\nour full confidence in its impartiality and integrity in the \r\nperformance of its safeguards obligations under the statute. \r\nTechnical asistamx and cooperation Constitute one Of \r\nthe key elements of the Agency’s activities. From the \r\nstandpoint of my Government’s support for that part of the \r\nprogramme, it is reassuring to note that the predominant \r\nportion of requests from Member States relate to \r\nnon-power applications of nuclear technologies, notably in \r\nthe fields of human health, food and agricuhure, industry, \r\nphysical and chemical sciences, and radiation protection. \r\nWe also appreciate that particular emphasis is now being \r\nplaced on the actual requirements as seen by the recipient \r\ncountries and on infiastructural improvements, taking into \r\naccount policies of sustainable development. \r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming my Government’s_ \r\ncommitment to its role as the host country of the Agency, \r\nand Austria’s continued high regard for the efficiency of \r\nthis important member of the United Nations family. I \r\nalso thank the Director General most warmly for his very \r\nkind remarks in that respect. \r\nMr. LAMAMXA (Algeria) (interpretation from \r\nFrench): Allow me first of all to thank Mr, Hans Blix, \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), for his very cogent presentation to the \r\nGeneral Assembly of the thorough and many-faceted IAEA \r\nreport, Mr. Blix has skilfully directed the Agency \r\nactivities referred to in the report and has also contributed \r\ngreatly, over the past 12 years, to the consolidation of the \r\nIAEA’s authority and efficacy, thus renewing the \r\nconfidence Member States have in him and leading to his \r\nreappointment. It is therefore a special pleasure for me to \r\nexpress to him, once again, warm congratulations from the \r\nAlgerian delegation and from me personally. \r\nIn the sphere of IAEA activities, the period covered in \r\nthe report before us has been a vigorous one \r\ninternationally, even though in this particular domain, as in \r\nso many others, efforts to strengthen multilateral action for \r\ndevelopment seem doomed to advance only imperfectly \r\nand incompletely. AS in the case of many other \r\nintergovernmental organizations, the adverse effect of \r\nshrinking financial resources is slowing down the Agency’s \r\nimpetus and unfortunately narrowing its field of activities, \r\nwhile at the same time mankind’s ingenious breakthroughs \r\nin mastering the forces of nature seem to be constantly \r\nexpanding the range of practical applications of nuclear \r\ntec~ob in the service of the human race and its \r\nwell-being. At a time when there are both promises and \r\nhazards inherent in the awakened interest of a number of \r\nnations that are giving nuclear energY a greater de, the \r\nIAEA, whose management and secretariat have f”‘r \r\ngrasped the meaning and importance Of this major trend% \r\nmust now, more than ever, be the crucible of strengthened \r\ninternational cooperation that embodies a fair b,a’ancc \r\nbetween the Agency’s raison d’gtre, which Is the \r\npromotion of scientific, economic and social WWess to \r\nrespond to the growing needs of the entire i~te~ntional \r\ncommunity, and its statutory obligation to monitor the \r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons through its safeguards \r\nsystem. \r\nThe annual report of the IAEA gives US R vet?’ \r\naccurate account of the Agency’s multifaceted offotQ over \r\nthe past year, This far-reaching undertaking has a number \r\nof positive impacts on the economies and the daily lives of \r\ncertain developing countries that receive technical \r\nassistance from the Agency. These positive impacIs, \r\nmodest but none the less appreciable, can be seen in the \r\nvaluable support of nuclear technology for such projects as \r\nthe irradiation of foodstuffs in countries struggling either \r\nagainst famine or for nutritional self-sufficiency. “ItWe is \r\nalso potential for considerable positive impact, through \r\nincreased output and improved cost-effectiveness, in a \r\nnumber of fields of activity, such as agriculture, public \r\nhealth, industry or the use of locally produced \r\nradio-isotopes. \r\nIn addition to all that the IAEA, if given the proper \r\nresources, could do in contributing to sustainable economic \r\nand ecological development, it also has an important role \r\nto play in the vast area of human security, whose \r\ninterrelated dimensions include the legitimate and \r\nwidespread public apprehension regarding the devastating \r\neffects of nuclear disasters, This role is inherent in the \r\nAgency’s fundamental responsibility for the safety of \r\nnuclear facilities in that it requires measures for practical \r\ncooperation and regulated output. \r\nIt is fitting here to underline the importance that is so \r\nnaturally attached to the efforts that the Agency’s directors \r\nshould continue to make in order to achieve n dynamic \r\nbalance between monitoring activities and promotional \r\nactivities. In this regard, providing adequate, reliable and \r\npredictable financial resources for the Agency’s technics1 \r\nassistance and technical cooperation activities should \r\nbecome an essential obligation for all States that desire to \r\nmake it possible for the IAEA to carry out its mission to \r\nthe fullest. \r\nIn this light, the universal influence of the IAEA and \r\nits Prestige in the developing countries and in public \r\nopinion would be better and more lastingly served bp \r\nconcrete and significant achievements in the areaS of \r\ntechnical assistance and nuclear safety, At the Same time. \r\n45th meeting - Monday, 1 November 1993 11 \r\nthe very limited number of instances of safeguards-related \r\nproblems that the Agency has dealt with, calmly and in the \r\nspirit of finding appropriate .solutions, should result not in \r\nhampering the transfer of nuclear technology for the \r\nbenefit of the developing countries but, rather, in providing \r\nreassurance regarding the IAEA’s ability to assume its till \r\nrole vz’s-d-vis the rights and obligations of parties to the \r\nsafeguards agreements. \r\nAgainst the dual backdrop of the IAEA’s influence \r\nand the consensual nature that prevails in its relations with \r\nStates, one of the aspects of the General Assembly’s \r\nconsideration of the Agency’s annual report should be, we \r\nbelieve, to promote the widest possible interest in the \r\nAgency on the part of the international community and to \r\ncontribute to encouraging all States to join it so that its \r\nmembership can keep pace with the progress of the United \r\nNations towards universality. Furthermore, the changes \r\nunder way regarding the composition of the United Nations \r\nbodies having restricted membership should be quickly \r\ntaken up by the IAEA so that it can enhance the \r\nrepresentativeness of its Board of Governors by means of \r\nan expansion that would do justice to the desire for \r\nparticipation and would reward the deserving progress of \r\ncertain developing countries in the area of peaceful uses of \r\natomic energy. \r\nAlgeria has every reason to be pleased about the \r\nrelations it has developed with the IAEA, These \r\nflourishing relations go back many years, and through the \r\nyears they have involved a great range of projects for \r\ntechnical cooperation, which have benefited from IAEA \r\nexpertise and financing, These relations have also \r\ninvolved Algeria’s voluntary submission of its two research \r\nand radio-isotope-production reactors to the Agency’s \r\nsafeguards system. \r\nFrom a more general standpoint, Algeria has spared \r\nno effort to make its contribution to the proper functioning \r\nof the Agency and its main organs. We welcome the fact \r\nthat, in return, the member States of the Agency conferred \r\nupon me, and, thus, on Algeria, the presidency of the \r\nBoard of Governors for the period covered by the report \r\nthe General Assembly now has before it, \r\nMr. UNNIKRISHNAN (India): At the very outset, I \r\ncongratulate Mr, Hans Blix, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on his \r\nreappointment for a fourth term, with the unanimous \r\napproval of the recent General Conference of the Agency. \r\nDuring the last 12 years Mr. Blix has served the Agency \r\nwith distinction and wisdom, and we have every \r\nconfidence that he will continue to provide effective \r\nleadership to the IAEA in the new and varied tasks before \r\nit, \r\nWe have carefully perused the IAEA report and have \r\nalso listened to the statement of its Director General with \r\ngreat interest. India has been a member of the IAEA since \r\nits inception in 1956. We have attached great importance \r\nto the objectives and activities of the Agency, as outlined \r\nin its Statute, and have been active participants in the \r\nIAEA from the beginning. The Agency’s primary \r\nobjective, as clearly spelt out in its Statute, is to accelerate \r\nand enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, \r\nhealth and development throughout the world, \r\nWe must also remind ourselves, when it becomes \r\nnecessary, that its primary objective remains the promotion \r\nof the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In recent years, for \r\na number of political reasons, the Agency’s “safeguards” \r\nrole has come to acquire public prominence. We in India \r\nhave always reaffirmed the importance of safeguards and \r\nhave supported the Agency’s activities in this area, At the \r\nsame time, we attach importance to the Agency’s \r\npromotional role in the fields of power, agriculture, \r\nmedicine and other areas, The vast majority of the \r\nAgency’s members, particularly the developing countries, \r\nhave expectations of the IAEA and its role in the transfer \r\nof technology and in scientific and technical cooperation. \r\nWe note that these issues came up for discussion \r\nduring the recent General Conference. The resolution \r\nadopted on the strengthening of the main activities \r\n(GC(XXXVfI)IRESI618) asks the Agency to present new \r\ninitiatives, particutarly with regard to technical cooperation \r\nactivities aimed at enhancing the scientific and \r\ntechnological capabilities of developing countries in the \r\npeaceful applications of nuclear energy. We look forward \r\nto the Agency’s initiatives in response to this resolution. \r\nA specific initiative in this regard over the last year is the \r\nproposal on practical utilization of food irradiation in \r\ndeveloping countries. We welcome the General \r\nConference resolution (GC(XXXVII)IRESI616) on this \r\nsubject, and hope that further work will be done in this \r\narea, as a concrete and visible example of how the IAEA \r\ncan assist developing countries, \r\nThe Agency’s so-called failure todetect weaponization \r\nprogrammes in some countries has been referred to. In \r\nrecent years the Agency has been criticized by some \r\nsections of the media on this score. In our view, such \r\ncriticism stems from a misunderstanding of the Agency’s \r\nproper role and functioning. The Agency cannot be a \r\npoliceman on the prowl. It cannot be expected to go \r\nlooking for bombs in every basement. Its role is to apply \r\nsafeguards, essentially as a confidence-building measure in \r\nterms of the safeguards agreements that Member States \r\nvoluntarily enter into with it. We believe that it will be \r\nuseful for the Agency to explain the nature of its activities \r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session \r\nto the public and the media so that such miSCOncePtions \r\ncan be removed. \r\nReferences have been made to the Non-Proliferation \r\nTreaty (NPT). India has always unequivocally supported \r\nall efforts at non-proliferation which are universal and \r\nnon-discriminatory. However, I would like to repeat that \r\nwe cannot subscribe to a Treaty or an attitude that divides \r\nthe world into nuclear “haves” and “have-nets”, with an \r\ninherently inequitable set of responsibilities and obligations \r\nfor the two. 1 hope the NPT Review and extension \r\nconference in 1995 will be an opportunity for States Parties \r\nto ponder over how it can be made into an instrument \r\nleading to genuine non-proliferation. In this context, I \r\nLvould also reiterate our commitment to the goal of general \r\nand complete disarmament. The safeguards the IAEA \r\nimplements flow from the agreements that Member States \r\nvoluntarily enter into with it. This does not make the \r\nIAEA the secretariat of the NPT. The safeguards can also \r\nflow from other bilateral or multilateral arrangements, \r\nvoluntarily entered into by sovereign States. \r\nIndia is one of the founder signatories of the chemical \r\nweapons Convention. It has been suggested that the IAEA \r\ndraw upon the provisions of the verification mechanism \r\nunder this Convention to bring about modifications in the \r\nAgency’s safeguards system, In this context, it should be \r\nrecognized that the chemical weapons Convention is \r\nuniversal and non-discriminatory. Moreover, it is still at \r\na nascent stage, and therefore rushing to copy its \r\nprovisions before it has even come into effect would not be \r\nprudent. \r\nReferences have been made to the implementation of \r\nthe safeguards agreements between the Agency and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. This is a \r\nsubstantive and complex issue that has been under \r\ndiscussion at the IAEA and elsewhere for months. Our \r\nposition has been that a solution to the issue should be \r\nfound through patient negotiations and discussions, Any \r\nother avenue will not achieve the desired results. It is for \r\nthis reason that we have in the past urged patience and \r\nperseverance. It is also for this reason that we have had to \r\nabstain on some of the resolutions on this subject at the \r\nIAEA. Despite reservations on some wording in the \r\nPresent draft resolution, we would go along with it in the \r\nhm%t Of consensus, while urging both the IAEA and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to persevere in \r\ntheir efforts to cooperate and fully implement the \r\nsafeguards agreement. We also urge others concerned to \r\ncontinue to support such efforts. \r\nBefore I conclude, allow me to reiterate the need for \r\nthe Agency to redouble its efforts in the promotion of the \r\npeaceful application of nuclear energy and to initiate \r\nlarge-scale public awareness programmes. The safeguards \r\nsystem should be streamlined to be both productive aad \r\ncost-effective. For our part, we will render our full and \r\nactive support and cooperation to the Agency ia \r\nsuccessfully achieving these aims. \r\nMr. WLOSOWICZ (Poland): At the outset I should \r\nlike to express Poland’s deep appreciation of the work of \r\nthe Director General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) and its highly competent staff. This has \r\nbeen a particularly challenging year, in which the IAEA \r\nhas performed very well. The exemplary manner in which \r\nthe Director General, Mr. Hans Blix, has been conducting \r\nthe work of his Agency merits our gratitude and respect, \r\nIt therefore gives me great satisfaction to convey to the \r\nDirector General my delegation’s heartfelt congratulations \r\non his reappointment to another term of office. \r\nThe delegation of Poland considers the annual report \r\nof the IAEA and the introductory statement by the Director \r\nGeneral, Mr. Hans Blix, to be a successful attempt to \r\npresent a comprehensive and well-balanced analysis of the \r\nAgency’s activities in 1992. The overall activity of the \r\nAgency has remained faithful to the objectives enshrined \r\nin its statute: to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy and, through its safeguards activity, to serve the \r\ncause of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. \r\nThe latest developments in international relations have \r\nonce again demonstrated the important role the Agency \r\nplays in the sphere of international security, economic \r\ndevelopment, nuclear safety and the human environment. \r\nThese developments open new prospects for the Agency \r\nand, at the same time, pose new challenges to it. \r\nSome events seem to indicate that the role of the \r\nAgency may be further expanded in the future to cover \r\nnew verification tasks both in nuclear non-proliferation and \r\nin the process of nuclear disarmament. As we see it, an \r\nexpanded verification function for the IAEA in respect of \r\nnuclear material released from a reduction in nuclear \r\nweapons would no doubt help the cause of nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and world-wide public acceptance of \r\nnuclear-power plants. \r\nr \r\nThe Agency should be praised for its continued efforts \r\nin Iraq in fulfilment of Security Council resolution \r\n687 (1991). Iraq’s non-compliance with its \r\nnon-proliferation Treaty obligations exposed an urgent 1 \r\nneed for IAEA safeguards to be strengthened, 1 \r\nThe Agency’s intensive safeguards activities in South \r\n1 \r\nb \r\nAfrica as well as in verifying the termination of its past i \r\nnuclear-weapons programme, has made credible that ! \r\ncountry’s integration into the international nuclear : \r\n45th meeting - Monday, 1 November 1993 13 \r\nnon-proliferation regime and is contributing to the process \r\nof the denuclearization of Africa. \r\nWe also welcome the news from Latin America, \r\nwhere the quadripartite agreement between Argentina, \r\nBrazil, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and \r\nControl of Nuclear Materials and the IAEA is close to \r\nimplementation, and the Treaty of Tlatelolco will, it is \r\nhoped, soon come into force and cover all countries of the \r\ncontinent. \r\nRecent progress in the peace process in the Middle \r\nEast opens up brighter prospects for a future nuclear- \r\nweapon-free zone in that area with corresponding IAEA \r\nsafeguards as part of the agreement. \r\nWe view all these positive developments in the \r\ncontext of the preparations for the 1995 review and \r\nextension Conference of the non-proliferation Treaty. We \r\nsupport the indefinite extension of the Treaty, which we \r\nbelieve remains indispensable for the security of its States \r\nparties and the world at large. We also see the need for a \r\nthorough and meaningful discussion of the Treaty’s \r\nimplementation, including the articles on nuclear \r\ndisarmament and assistance in the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy. Expected progress in the negotiation of a \r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty and in the provision by all \r\nnuclear Powers of security assurances to \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States should help to ensure the \r\nsuccess of the Conference. \r\nIn the context of extending and strengthening the \r\nnon-proliferation Treaty, we remain concerned about the \r\nquestion of the implementation of the safeguards agreement \r\nbetween the IAEA and the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea. At the recent IAEA General Conference we \r\njoined others in urging the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to comply fully with its non-proliferation Treaty \r\ncommitments and safeguards obligations. \r\nThe IAEA activities aiming at the application of \r\nsafeguards in the newly independent States with substantial \r\nnuclear programmes which emerged from the former \r\nSoviet Union are closely followed by and have the firm \r\nsupport of Poland. We urge all States which still remain \r\noutside the non-proliferation Treaty and the IAEA \r\nsafeguards system to accede to them at an early date. \r\nNuclear-power plants operated or constructed in \r\ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe, the majority of \r\nthem neighbours of Poland, have during 1992 and 1993 \r\nbeen subject to review and an assessment of their safety \r\nfeatures. Improvements have been and still are being \r\nintroduced in order to remedy the shortcomings identified \r\nin nuclear-power plants and in national nuclear regulatory \r\nsystems. We are grateful to donor countries, to \r\ninternational organizations and, above all, to the IAEA for \r\nthe assistance that has already been provided under this \r\nprogramme, in which Polish experts also participate. \r\nPoland supports the Agency’s work on preparing a \r\nnuclear safety convention. As regards the issue of liability \r\nfor nuclear damage, we commend the substantial progress \r\nmade by the Standing Committee on Liability for Nuclear \r\nDamage in preparing a revision of the Vienna Convention. \r\nPoland traditionally supports the Agency’s Technical \r\nCooperation Programme, being both a beneficiary of and \r\na contributor to it. International cooperation has been vital \r\nfor the development of our nuclear industry, research and \r\neducation. \r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate our appreciation to \r\nthe Director General of the IAEA, Mr. Hans Blix, and our \r\nsupport for the Agency’s goals. That support finds its \r\nreflection in our co-sponsoring of the draft resolution on \r\nthe report of the IAEA. \r\nMr. MALIK (Iraq) (‘interpretation from Arabic): The \r\ndelegation of Iraq participates once again in the discussion \r\non the agenda item on the report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which appears on the \r\nagenda on an annual basis, Every time the delegation of \r\nIraq emphasizes that it is necessary not to pol’iticize the \r\nwork of the IAEA and to protect the technical nature of its \r\nwork. \r\nThe politicization of the work of the Agency is very \r\ndangerous in both the short term and the long term. Hence \r\nwe must all be objective, clear and take into consideration \r\nthe real interests of member States. In this way we could \r\navoid the narrow interests which push some countries into \r\nthe dangerous path of politicization. \r\nI have brought to this meeting copies of two \r\ndocuments. The first of these is the report submitted by \r\nMr. Rolf Ekeus, the Executive Chairman of the United \r\nNations Special Commission, to the President of the \r\nSecurity Council. This report, which is contained in \r\ndocument S/26571, dated 12 October 1993, includes the \r\nminutes of the discussions that took place in Baghdad in \r\nOctober 1993. Paragraph 14, which is in the section of the \r\nreport dealing with Iraq’s nuclear programme, reads as \r\nfollows: \r\n“IAEA is confident that the essential elements of \r\nIraq’s nuclear weapons programme are understood and \r\nhave been dismantled. The remaining outstanding \r\nissues for compliance with paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 \r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session \r\nof Security Council resolution 687 (1991) relate to \r\nprocurement and official acceptance of the ongoing \r\nmonitoring and verification plan approved by Security \r\nCouncil resolution 715 (1991).” (S/26571, Appendix, \r\npara. 14) \r\nParagraph 15 reads as follows: \r\n“Iraq has now provided IAEA with critical \r\ninformation regarding suppliers of prohibited and \r\nother materials and sources of technical advice. The \r\ninformation appears to be complete and verifiable. \r\nThis information will be verified in the course of the \r\nnext few weeks. With the provision of this \r\ninformation, Iraq has now complied with all disclosure \r\nrequirements concerning its previous nuclear weapons \r\nprogramme as contained in resolutions 687 (1991) and \r\n707 (1991).” (ibid., para. 15) \r\n; Paragraph 16, which relates to implementation of the \r\nmonitoring and verification plan, reads as follows: \r\n“IAEA has phased in elements of its plan over \r\nthe last 15 months. Iraq is aware of all the elements \r\nof this plan.” (ibid., para. 16) \r\nParagraph 18 reads as follows: \r\n“IAEA is satisfied that the plan has so far been \r\nimplemented properly and will add or subtract \r\nelements as conditions require.” (ibid, para. 18) \r\nThe second document of which I have brought a copy \r\nis a Security Council report - document S/26584, dated 14 \r\nOctober 1993 -containing the text of a letter from the \r\nDirector General of IAEA, Mr. Hans Blix, to the United \r\nNations Secretary-General. This letter says: \r\n“As you can see from the Joint Report, the IAEA \r\nhas received the long requested critical information \r\nregarding suppliers of prohibited and other material \r\nand sources of technical advice, Subject to the \r\nverification of this information for accuracy and \r\ncompleteness, Iraq would be regarded to have \r\ncomplied with all disclosure requirements. concerning \r\nits nuclear activities as provided for in resolutions \r\n687 and 707 (1991). This is similar to the \r\nconclusions of the Special Commission with regard to \r\nthe disclosure by Iraq of the information relevant to \r\nits proscribed programmes in the ballistic and \r\nbiological areas.” (S/26584, p. 2) \r\nMr. Blix has confirmed that, fact this morning. \r\nThese testimonies of the two officials directly 1 \r\nresponsible for the implementation of Part C of Security ) \r\nCouncil resolution 687 (1991) constitute crystal-clear \r\nevidence of the positive progress achieved recently, of the j \r\nfull cooperation of the Iraqi authorities at the highest level I \r\nwith the various inspection teams, and of Iraq’s full / \r\ncompliance with the said resolution. \r\nAny objective reader of the two Security Council \r\ndocuments from which I have just quoted - the one \r\ncontaining the Special Commission’s report, and the other \r\ncontaining the letter from the Director General of the \r\nIAEA - would not fail to recognize the positive atmosphere \r\nof and the great progress that has been made in the \r\nrelations between Iraq and those bodies. \r\nThe General Assembly should encourage this \r\napproach, rather than put obstacles in the way of the \r\npositive and constructive actions that Iraq has taken so far, \r\nThere are those who insist on attacking Iraq, on \r\nmanipulating the facts for political ends and on fabricating \r\njustifications for continuing the inhuman economic \r\nblockade against the people of Iraq, which has led to the \r\ndeath of hundreds of thousands of men and women - \r\nincluding old people - and children. \r\nIraq has discharged all its obligations under Part C of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991), and it expects the \r\nSecurity Council to end the economic embargo on its \r\nexports, in accordance with paragraph 22 of the same \r\nresolution. The Council’s resolution which has been \r\ndescribed as binding, must be binding to all parties, \r\nincluding the Security Council members. \r\nHaving said this concerning the binding nature of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991), I should like to \r\nrefer to paragraph 14 thereof, in which the Council: \r\n“Takes nole that the actions to be taken by Iraq \r\nin paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the present I \r\nresolution represent steps towards the goal of \r\nestablishing in the Middle East a zone free from \r\nweapons of mass destruction”. (Security Council \r\nresolution 687 (1991), para. 14) \r\nIt is worth observing that none of the representatives who \r\nhave spoken so far has mentioned this paragraph or saw tit \r\nto call upon all the States of the region to work seriously \r\ntowards its implementation, by adhering to the \r\nnon-proliferation Treaty and accepting an effective \r\nsafeguards system. I \r\nI should like, in conclusion, to comment on draft F j \r\nresolution A/48/L.13. The eighth preambular paragraph 1 \r\nhas become anachronistic indeed as it does not reflect the 1 \r\n45th meeting - Monday, 1 November 1993 15 \r\npresent realities, to which the Executive Chairman of the \r\nSpecial Commission and the Director General of IAEA \r\nhave attested. According to the testimonies of those two \r\ngentlemen, Iraq has been cooperating and has abided by \r\nthe provisions of Security Council 687 (1991). \r\nConsequently, the eighth preambular paragraph of the draft \r\nresolution should read as follows: \r\n“Noting the statements and actions of the Agency \r\nconcerning Iraq’s compliance with its \r\nnon-proliferation obligations.” \r\nConsequently, this preambular paragraph in A/48/L. 13 \r\nas it stands now contradicts the reports of the president of \r\nthe Special Commission and the Director General of the \r\nIAEA, and cannot be considered as it is correct. We \r\ncannot agree to it. \r\nAs for operative paragraph 8, it fails to mention the \r\ndiscussions that took place in Baghdad in July, in New \r\nYork in September and again in Baghdad in October of \r\nthis year. These important and constructive talks took \r\nplace between Iraq and the Special Commission and an \r\nIAEA team. Consequently, this paragraph does not reflect \r\nthe real facts, which have become known to everybody \r\nhere. \r\nFor all these reasons, the delegation of Iraq would \r\nrequest separate voting on the aforementioned paragraphs \r\nand on the resolution as a whole. \r\nBefore I conclude my statement, I cannot but say that \r\nit is really ironic and paradoxical that Israel is one of the \r\nsponsors of this draft resolution. \r\nMs. MASON (Canada): At the outset, let me echo the \r\nsatisfaction which others before me have expressed to the \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), Mr. Hans Blix, for his detailed and \r\ncomprehensive statement. \r\nCanada is very pleased to sponsor draft \r\nresolution A/48/L. 13 and Corr. 1 on the annual report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, It is most \r\nappropriate at this time to acknowledge the range of work \r\nof this important United Nations agency. \r\nNow more than ever, we are aware of the vital role \r\nthat the IAEA plays in supporting the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation Treaty and the global nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime as a whole, given the Agency’s \r\nparamount role as the custodian of international safeguards \r\narrangements. The IAEA is also key in ensuring the safe \r\nuse of nuclear energy and in promoting the peaceful \r\napplications of nuclear technology. \r\nIn the past year, the Agency has faced some \r\nnew - and, unfortunately, disquieting - challenges to the \r\nintegrity of the international system it supports, challenges \r\nposed especially by developments in Iraq and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, both of which are \r\nreferred to in the draft resolution. However, these \r\ndevelopments have also proved that the Agency is the best \r\nforum to deal with such problems. The Government of \r\nCanada remains concerned about non-compliance by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea with its safeguards \r\nagreement and continues to urge that country to meet its \r\nobligations. We also want to take this opportunity to \r\nreiterate that the Agency fimctions to advance the interests \r\nof all Member States and thus acts on behalf of the \r\ninternational community as a whole. \r\nI want to use this opportunity to share briefly some \r\nCanadian thinking about the orientation of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency. In our statement to the recent \r\nGeneral Conference, we proposed that the basic mission of \r\nthe Agency be refocused to consist of three pillars: \r\nsafeguards, safety, and technology transfer. \r\nThe purpose of safeguards is to ensure that an \r\neffective and efficient system is implemented and \r\nmaintained. Study is now being given to how to \r\nstrengthen and streamline safeguards. Canada believes that \r\nAgency safeguards should evolve from a purely \r\nquantitative system, based on material balance accounting, \r\nto one which includes the detection of undeclared activities \r\nand facilities. There are several alternative safeguards \r\nmodels which are capable of doing this. The reform of \r\nsafeguards will require the marshalling of our collective \r\npolitical will, to ensure that our joint efforts to promote \r\nnuclear non-proliferation are as effective and efficient as \r\npossible. \r\nSafety is another key function of the Agency, since \r\nbeing able to demonstrate the safety of all nuclear activities \r\nis one’ of the keys to furthering public acceptance of \r\nnuclear energy. For many countries, nuclear power will \r\nbecome an increasingly important source for meeting \r\ngrowing energy demands. It also offers some \r\nenvironmental benefits. We therefore look forward to the \r\nearly conclusion of the negotiation on the nuclear safety \r\nconvention, which will be an important international \r\ninstrument in this field. \r\nTechnology transfer is another key activity of the \r\nAgency, It permits the appropriate applications of nuclear \r\ntechnology in meeting the needs of Member States in the \r\nfields of food and agriculture, human health, water \r\nresources, environmental studies, industrial applications \r\nand, of course, energy. \r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session \r\nIn Canada’s view, each of these three pillars is \r\ninterrelated with and interdependent on the other. Taken \r\ntogether, we believe that this three-pronged approach can \r\nlead to a good balance - and, I might say, a mutually \r\nreinforcing balance - among the Agency’s activities. \r\nIn conclusion, the Canadian delegation is pleased to \r\nco-sponsor this draft resolution, and, along with the \r\nAustralian delegation, which introduced it, Canada \r\ncommends it to all delegations as an expression of the \r\ncommitment we have all made to the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy and to nuclear non-proliferation. \r\nMr. HOU Zhitong (China) (interprefation from \r\nChinese): The Chinese delegation listened carefully to the \r\nstatement of Mr. Blix, .Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and has taken note of its \r\nannual report. Over the past year, the Agency has done a \r\ngreat deal of work and exerted active efforts in such major \r\nfields as safeguards, peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and \r\nnuclear safety. For this, we wish to express our \r\nsatisfaction. \r\nMr. Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), Vice-Presideni, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\nThe Chinese delegation warmty congratulates Mr. Blix \r\non his reappointment as Director General of the Agency. \r\nInternational cooperation for the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy is an important task confronting the \r\nAgency. Nuclear energy, as a clean and reliable alternative \r\nenergy source, has brought prospects for development. \r\nMany countries, especially the developing countries, \r\nurgently need nuclear energy for their economic \r\ndevelopment and environmental protection. The \r\ninternational community expects the IAEA to make further \r\nefforts and contributions in this regard. \r\nAnother important task facing the IAEA is to \r\nimplement safeguards that. will prevent the proliferation of \r\nnuclear weapons, including nuclear explosive devices, \r\nOver the years, the Agency has accomplished a lot and \r\naccumulated wide experience in this regard, The \r\nsafeguards regime is a universally accepted measure for the \r\nprevention of nuclear proliferation. In order to ensure that \r\ninternational cooperation on nuclear energy will serve \r\npeaceful purposes, the acceptance of IAEA safeguards \r\nshould be the prerequisite for such cooperation. \r\nIn the past year, the IAEA, as an intergovernmental \r\norganization, has played a unique role in international \r\ncooperation for the development of peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy. But, it should be noted that current \r\ninternational cooperation for the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy is far from satisfactory, and is faced with numerous \r\ndifficulties and problems, The attempt to monopolize \r\nnuclear science and technology and, under the pretext of \r\npreventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to restrict \r\nand undermine the legitimate rights and interests of the \r\ndeveloping countries in regard to the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy will facilitate neither international \r\ncooperation for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy nor the \r\ninternational endeavour to prevent nuclear proliferation. \r\nThe Agency is faced with the challenge of how to \r\nstrike an equitable balance between efforts to promote \r\ninternational cooperation in nuclear energy and those being \r\nmade to strengthen the safeguards regime, The Chinese \r\ndelegation is of the view that equal importance should be \r\nattached to both of those IAEA functions without prejudice \r\nto either. China supports the Agency’s efforts in its \r\nsafeguards activities and believes that they should be aimed \r\nat preventing nuclear proliferation rather than at impeding \r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy by developing \r\ncountries. Should disputes arise in this connection, they \r\nshould be solved by the parties directly involved through \r\nconstructive consultations and negotiations and not by the \r\nimposition of pressure or even sanctions. Practice has \r\nshown that neither pressure nor sanctions will help to solve \r\nthe problem. \r\nI should like to reiterate that the Chinese \r\nGovernment’s policy has always been against advocating, \r\nencouraging or engaging in nuclear proliferation and \r\nagainst assisting other countries to develop nuclear \r\nweapons. China’s nuclear-export policy has always been \r\nbased strictly on three principles, namely, that such exports \r\nare intended for peaceful purposes, that IAEA safeguards \r\nhave been accepted and adhered to and that there will be \r\nno transfer of material to any third country without China’s \r\nprior consent. China will, as always, continue to \r\ncontribute to and make efforts towards achieving \r\ninternational cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy in order to realize greater benefits for mankind \r\nderived from nuclear energy. \r\nMr. GUfLLA UME (Belgium) (interpretation from \r\nFrench): It is my honour to speak today on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Community and its member States. \r\nThe Assembly has before it today the report of the \r\nIntemationaI Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) drafted by its \r\nDirector General, Mr. Blix, whose mandate has just been \r\nrenewed for four more years. Before beginning \r\nconsideration of the report, I should like, on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Community and its member States, to take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate the Director General for his \r\nwork, to thank him for the able manner in which he has \r\nconducted the work of the Agency for the past 12 years \r\n45th meeting - Monday, 1 November 1993 17 \r\nand to convey to him our warmest wishes for the years \r\nahead, years that will be decisive for the policy of non- \r\nproliferation, in particular, in which his is a crucial role. \r\nAt the outset, I should like to speak about the \r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons, an area in which the \r\ninternational community and the Agency have had to deal \r\nwith major developments during the past year. \r\nThe most serious problem was the non-implementation \r\nof the safeguards agreement between the Agency and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. The European \r\nCommunity and its member States remain deeply \r\nconcerned at the fact that, notwithstanding the international \r\ncommunity’s forbearance, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea has not yet fulfilled the commitments \r\ninto which it has entered; they solemnly urge the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to reaffirm its \r\nunconditional adherence to the Treaty on the Non- \r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to implement in \r\ngood faith the full-scope safeguards agreement entered into \r\nwith the IAEA on 30 January 1992 and to agree to \r\ninspection of the two sites designated by the Agency. \r\nFurthermore, the European Community and its member \r\nStates keenly regret that in the course of recent \r\nconsultations with an IAEA delegation at Pyong Yang the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Korea expressed no readiness to \r\nhonour its commitments but, on the contrary, sought to \r\nlimit the scope of the consultations and even to set \r\nconditions for their continuation, which is unacceptable. \r\nHowever, we hope that the consultations can resume \r\nwithout preconditions and in a constructive spirit. \r\nThe European Community and its member States \r\nthank the Director General and his secretariat for the \r\ndiligence, professional skill and impartiality they have \r\ndemonstrated throughout this delicate period, and we \r\nwould ask them to continue their activities with vigour. In \r\naddition, we would request the Agency’s Director General \r\nto keep the Security Council and States members of the \r\nAgency informed of any major development in this \r\nconnection. \r\nIn addition, the European Community and its member \r\nStates hope for resumption of the dialogue between the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and South Korea \r\nthat will in the near future, in keeping with the Joint \r\nDeclaration signed on 3 1 December 1991, lead to the \r\ncreation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone on the Korean \r\npeninsula. \r\nThe European Community and its member States wish \r\nalso to express their concern at the situation in the former \r\nSoviet Union. We welcome, of course, the accession of \r\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Belarns, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania \r\nand Uzbekistan to the NPT. They also appreciate the \r\nsecretariat’s efforts to prepare for the implementation of \r\nsafeguards in other States of the former USSR. We urge \r\nthose countries, especially Ukraine and Kazakhstan, to \r\naccede to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States. More \r\n‘generally, we urge those two States to apply, without \r\ndelay, the commitments contained in the Lisbon Protocol. \r\nThe European Community and its member States hope that \r\nthe agreement reached between the Russian Federation and \r\nUkraine on 3 September 1993 concerning the return to \r\nRussia of those nuclear warheads located in Ukraine will \r\nbe implemented without delay. \r\nAnother source of major concern is the situation in ; \r\nIraq. The European Community and its member States _ \r\nregret that that country has not yet implemented the \r\nprovisions of Security Council resolutions 687 (1991) and \r\n707 (1991). They urge Iraq to provide the’ IAEA with all \r\nthe necessary data on its nuclear programme that is not yet \r\navailable. \r\nThe European Community and its member States \r\nrequest the Director General to implement without delay \r\nthe provisions of the plans for future ongoing monitoring \r\ncalled for in Security Council resolution 71.5 (1991) while:: \r\ncontinuing, as provided in resolution 687 (1991), to seek \r\nout the constituent elements of Iraq’s clandestine \r\nprogramme that have not yet been disclosed. \r\nAnother major development concerning non- \r\nproliferation was, of course, the South African \r\nGovernment’s acknowledgement of the fact that nuclear \r\nexplosive devices had been developed in South Africa \r\nduring the 1980s and that they had been dismantled prior \r\nto South Africa’s accession to the NPT. The European \r\nCommunity and its member States welcome that \r\ntransparency, which demonstrates that the renunciation of \r\na clandestine nuclear programme is possible and that it can \r\nbe done at the will of the country in question. We also \r\ntake note of the Director General’s report on the Agency’s \r\nverification activities in South Africa. \r\nIn that connection, the European Community and its \r\nmember States welcome the substantial progress made over \r\nthe past year in the negotiations on the creation of a \r\ndenuclearized zone in Africa, \r\nThe European Community and its member States \r\nwelcome the progress towards peace in the Middle East. \r\nRecent developments justify the hope that conditions for \r\nthe creation of a denuclearized zone in that region and \r\nimplementation of the full-scope safeguards system in the \r\nMiddle East can soon be realized. \r\n18 \r\nGeneral Assembly - Forty-eighth session \r\nThe European Comm.uniw and its member States hope \r\nthat the process of ratification of the quadrtparttte \r\nagreement signed by Argentina, Brazil, the Brazihan- \r\nArgentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear \r\nMaterial and the IAEA will soon be completed. \r\nTo conclude with the subject of non-proliferation, the \r\nEuropean Community and its member States welcome with \r\nsatisfaction the recent accessions of countries to the NI’T, \r\nwhich constitute important steps towards the universality \r\nof the non-proliferation regime, and we strongly urge all \r\ncountries that have not yet done so to accede to the Treaty \r\nfor an indefinite period. This was reaffirmed at the first \r\nsession of the Preparatory Committee held at New York \r\nlast May. We would recall that the NF’T is the only \r\ncomprehensive framework for the prevention of the spread \r\nof nuclear weapons. Thus, the European Community and \r\nits member States are prepared to assume their full \r\nresponsibilities and to spare no effort that can contribute to \r\nthe success of the preparatory process for the 19% \r\nConference, \r\nof exports and imports of nuclear material and exports of \r\nsome non-nuclear equipment and material. It should be \r\nrecalled that the purpose of this machinery is to give the \r\nsecretariat an overview of nuclear transfers and production \r\nthroughout the world. If we wish to achieve that aim, all \r\ncountries must participate in this machinery and \r\ncommunicate the relevant information. With respect to the \r\nEuropean Community and its member States, such \r\ninformation is now being regularly communicated to the \r\nDirector General. \r\nOn 10 August, the Conference on Disarmament in \r\nGeneva adopted by consensus a decision giving the Ad \r\nHoc Committee on a Nuclear Test Ban a mandate to \r\nnegotiate a comprehensive test-ban treaty. A multilateral \r\nnegotiation will soon begin, with a view to achieving a \r\nuniversally applicable treaty providing for an effective \r\nverification regime. The European Community and its \r\nmember States welcome this decisive step, which will \r\ncontribute to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. \r\nWe have noted in recent months some encouraging \r\ndevelopments which will certainly have a positive effect on \r\nthe question of a nuclear-test moratorium. Even if the \r\nTwelve cannot be indifferent to the recent test in China, \r\nthe first in a year, the recent decisions of some nuclear- \r\nweapon States to suspend their nuclear tests are an \r\nimportant development. We must welcome this further \r\nprogress in the struggle against nuclear-weapons \r\nproliferation. Moreover, we should recall the commitment \r\nundertaken by the United States and the four members of \r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States that signed the \r\nLisbon Protocol to reduce significantly their nuclear \r\narsenals; this constitutes another step in the same direction, \r\nThe Twelve hope that the parties concerned will soon be \r\nable to overcome my obstacle in the way of \r\nimplementation of the Protocol. \r\nThe European Community and its member States are \r\npleased that the proposals they made two years ago to \r\nstrengthen the Agency’s safeguards system were adopted \r\nby the Board of Governors and that the measures necessary \r\nfor their application are being gradually implemented, For \r\ninstance, machinery has been set in motion for notification \r\nThe strengthening of the Agency’s safeguards is not \r\nyet complete. Substantial efforts remain to be made to \r\ndeal with the real dangers of proliferation. In this respect, \r\nthe European Community and its member States are \r\npleased that the General Assembly adopted the draft \r\nresolution submitted at the Twelve’s initiative. \r\nThe study conducted by the Standing Advisory Group \r\non Safeguards Implementation on strengthening the \r\neffectiveness and improving the efftciency of the \r\nsafeguards system provided a useful working basis for the \r\nsecretariat to review the safeguards system more \r\nthoroughly. The purpose of this exercise is to make \r\npossible better detection of anomalies indicative of \r\nclandestine activity, even though it is difficult to SIX how \r\nthe Agency will ever be able to guarantee with any \r\ncertainty the absence of clandestine activities world kk. \r\nFurthermore, while we cannot ignore the need to \r\nreduce the cost of inspection missions, we must ensure that \r\nthis requirement does not hinder the development of a \r\nconsistent plan that can ensure the overall efficiency of the \r\nAgency’s safeguards, taking into account in a balanced \r\nway the actual risks of proliferation. The European \r\nCommunity and its member States listened with great \r\ninterest to the Director General’s report on the measures \r\ntaken to strengthen and improve the Agency’s safeguards \r\nsystem and look forward to the concrete proposals he will \r\nmake on this subject to the Board of Governors in \r\nDecember on the basis of the findings of the Standing \r\nAdvisory Group and the deliberations of the Board of \r\nGovernors in June, \r\nThe ongoing negotiations to achieve a partnership \r\nbetween the Agency’s inspection teams and EURATOM \r\nhave made substantial progress over the past year, \r\nEnhanced cooperation has already had beneficial effects on \r\nthe Agency’s budget. The European Community and its \r\nmember States welcome this. However, the full benefit \r\nanticipated from this agreement remains subject to many \r\ncontingencies, \r\nThe commitment of the two teams of inspectors to \r\naPPlY the partnership principles is indispensable. The \r\n45th meeting - Monday, 1 November 1993 19 \r\nEuropean Community and its member States request the \r\nDirector General to pursue discussions with a view to \r\nputting this partnership fully into effect as soon as \r\npossible. In the discussions on the partnership, one of the \r\nmost important elements of the progress achieved in recent \r\nmonths has been the confirmation of EURATOM as a \r\nregional safeguards system for ensuring that nuclear \r\nmaterials are not diverted to uses other than those declared \r\nby the States members of the European Community. \r\nEURATOM thus exercises functions that cannot in any \r\nway be exercised by a national monitoring system. \r\nToday, EURATOM is the sole example of an \r\norganization that makes possible the full implementation of \r\nsafeguards while adhering to five essential elements: a \r\nconstitutional framework for political cooperation; a well- \r\ndefined legal and regulatory framework; a transparent \r\nbudgetary and financial framework; an operational \r\nframework providing for the possibility of imposing \r\nsanctions; and, lastly, several decades of experience in the \r\neffective implementation of safeguards. \r\nThe status of regional safeguards system could be \r\nconferred on other regional institutions, provided that \r\ncertain clearly defined conditions were met. That is why \r\nthe European Community and its member States urge the \r\nDirector General to consider and submit to the Board of \r\nGovernors a document on the conditions that must be met \r\nby a regional organization if it is to negotiate a partnership \r\nagreement with the Agency. This document should \r\nprecisely stipulate the conditions for cooperation with \r\nrespect to safeguards. \r\nThe European Community and its member States are \r\ndeeply committed to the nuclear-export-control systems \r\nand, more specifically, to the guidelines adopted by the \r\nNuclear Suppliers Group. The European Community and \r\nits member States appeal to the supplier countries that have \r\nnot yet acceded to the export-control guidelines to do so as \r\nsoon as possible. We wish to contribute to the success of \r\nthe regime for controlling the export of nuclear material \r\nand technology of dual use which entered into force in \r\nJanuary 1993. All the members of the Nuclear Suppliers \r\nGroup have decided to require the application of full-scope \r\nIAEA safeguards to all nuclear activities, present and \r\nfuture, as a condition for new significant commitments to \r\nsupply non-nuclear-weapons States. \r\nHaving spoken of non-proliferation and the safeguards \r\nsystem, I should now like to touch on the activities of the \r\nAgency in the sphere of nuclear safety, protection against \r\nradiation and technical cooperation. \r\nThe benefits of the Agency’s activities in areas where \r\nnuclear technology is not being used for energy purposes \r\nare often underestimated and poorly understood. I should \r\nlike to speak first of nuclear safety, a sector in which the \r\nAgency plays a primary role. \r\nThe European Community and its member States \r\nwelcome the substantial progress made by the group of \r\nexperts that is to prepare a convention on nuclear safety. \r\nIn fact, we were the promoters of the convening of the \r\nConference on nuclear safety which decided to initiate the \r\nprocess of negotiating that international convention. We \r\nbelieve that the convention is a necessary instrument to \r\nimprove world wide, the safety system on the one hand \r\nand the cohesion of the basic safety principles on the other. \r\nThat is why the European Community and its member \r\nStates invite all States - particularly those with nuclear \r\nreactors on their territory - to participate actively in the \r\npreparatory work for the convention. \r\nWe can say that a clear consensus is emerging on \r\nlimiting the scope of the convention, for now, to power \r\nreactors. A diplomatic conference should be able to \r\nfmalize the text of the convention as early as possible in \r\n1994. \r\nAs regards a progressive approach to establishing an \r\ninternational nuclear safety regime, we welcome the fact \r\nthat the last General Conference provided an opportunity \r\nfor the international community to express its desire to \r\nstart work as soon as possible on preparing a convention \r\non the safety of radioactive waste management,’ once the \r\nwork now under way of developing basic principles for \r\nmanaging these wastes has achieved a broad international \r\nconsensus. \r\nThe Twelve recognize the usetilness of more \r\nadvanced technical research into the safety of other parts \r\nof the nuclear cycle, and also recognize that this work may \r\nin due course facilitate the future development of existing \r\ninternational instruments and of those to come. The \r\nEuropean Community and its member States introduced a \r\ndraft resolution on the subject at the IAEA General \r\nConference. \r\nThe European Community and its member States \r\nattach particular importance to nuclear safety in the \r\ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe and of the former \r\nUSSR, and, recall the Community countries’ substantial \r\ncontributions both in a strictly Community context - \r\nPHARE and TACIS - and in the Group of 24 and the \r\nmultilateral nuclear safety funds. We commend the \r\nAgency on its important role in this regard. \r\nThe Operational Safety Review Teams and \r\nAssessment of Safety Significant Events Teams missions, \r\nas well as the programmes for problem reactors, have \r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session \r\ncontinued to provide useful reference information for the \r\nactivities of the Group of 24. New initiatives, such as the \r\njoint activities of the IAEA and the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme to strengthen radiation protection \r\ninfrastructures and nuclear safety infrastructures in the \r\ncountries of the former USSR, and the International Arctic \r\nSeas Assessment Project, are adding to the Agency’s \r\ninvolvement in improving nuclear safety. \r\nFor some time, the IAEA Standing Committee on \r\nLiability for Nuclear Damage has been reviewing the \r\nVienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage \r\nand preparing a new convention on supplementary \r\nfinancing. Substantial results have been achieved. The \r\nCommunity and its member States attach great importance \r\nto the new drafts; we sincerely hope that the ongoing \r\ndiscussions will make it possible to arrive quickly at \r\nsolutions satisfactory to all concerned and that a diplomatic \r\nconference will be able to meet as soon as possible to \r\nfinalize the draft conventions. \r\nThe European Community and its member States view \r\nproviding technical assistance as one of the Agency’s \r\nessential tasks. We support the efforts along these lines \r\nmade by the IAEA secretariat. We feel that the peaceful \r\napplications of nuclear energy, whether medical, \r\nagricultural, industrial or for power production, should be \r\naccessible to all States. The Agency has a central role to \r\nplay in accelerating and facilitating this trend, while \r\nensuring that the development of nuclear activities goes \r\nhand in hand with observance of the highest levels of \r\nsafety and radiation protection, The Twelve States \r\nmembers of the European Community are ready to lend the \r\nAgency their support in this area, to the extent that \r\nbudgetary considerations permit, \r\nThe European Community and its member States \r\nregret having to express their concern, as they did last \r\nyear, about the Agency’s financial situation, In the \r\ninterests of the Agency’s proper finctioning, we appeal to \r\nall member States to pay their contributions to the \r\nAgency’s budget on time. \r\nWe appreciate the efforts of the Director General and \r\nhis colleagues to ensure that the Agency can fimction in \r\nthese difficuh conditions. In this context, the ‘Twelve are \r\nthe more appreciative of the exercise recently begun’by the \r\nsecretariat to study the efficiency of the Agency’s \r\nprogrammes in greater depth. The Agency must more than \r\never be able to concentrate on its essential tasks and \r\nterminate activities of secondary importance. \r\nMr. ERDbS (Hungary): The annual report for 1992 \r\nthat the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has \r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly, together with the \r\nsupplementary oral report and the introductory statement \r\nby the Director General, Mr. Hans Blix, reflect very well \r\nthe multifaceted activity of the Agency and the results \r\nachieved. The Agency’s work, carefully balanced between \r\nthe main fields of its activity, deserves the recognition of \r\nthe Member States, as expressed at the thirty-seventh \r\nsession of the Agency’s General Conference, held only a \r\nshort time ago. \r\nReiterating that evaluation, I wish to express the \r\nHungarian Government’s appreciation of the skilful and \r\nfully committed work carried out by the Agency’s staff in \r\norder to promote the peaceful application of nuclear energy \r\nworldwide, enhance the safety of the nuclear facilities in \r\noperation, and provide verifiable assurances for the \r\ncommunity of nations about the non-diversion of nuclear \r\nmaterial for non-peacetil purposes. \r\nOn behalf of the Hungarian delegation, and also on \r\nmy own behalf, I wish to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Blix on his recent reappointment for \r\nanother texm of office, and assure him of our continued \r\nsupport and cooperation in discharging his important and \r\nresponsible duties. \r\nDespite some discouraging signs, the positive trend \r\ntowards attaining our common goal, the establishment of \r\na genuinely universal nuclear non-proliferation regime, has \r\ncontinued during the period under review. We are pleased \r\nto note that all nuclear-weapon States are now Parties to \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT); South Africa has abandoned its nuclear weapons \r\nprogramme; and Latin America as well as Africa may soon \r\nemerge as nuclear-weapon-free continents. In view of the \r\n1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, these facts \r\nshould be considered very promising. \r\nHowever, international efforts should be redoubled to \r\nprevent and finally eliminate the threat of nuclear \r\nproliferation, and also to strengthen the nuclear non- \r\nproliferation regime in all its aspects. Pursuing its fully \r\ncommitted non-proliferation policy, the Hungarian \r\nGovernment continues to take an active part in this \r\nendeavour and once again urges all those States that have \r\nnot yet done so to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty \r\nas non-nuclear-weapon States, and also to conclude full- \r\nscope safeguards agreements with the IAEA. \r\nThe IAEA safeguards system, a key element of the \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime, has always played a \r\ncrucial role in preventing the use of nuclear energy for \r\nother than peaceful purposes. We are appreciative of the \r\nwork done so far by the Agency to improve the efficacy of \r\nthe existing safeguards system. The purpose is clear: to \r\nmake the safeguards system more capable of covering both \r\n45th meetine - Mondav. 1 November 1993 21 \r\ndeclared and undeclared activities, thus providing \r\nsufficiently convincing assurances for all States about the \r\nexclusively peaceful nature of the nuclear programmes of \r\nother States. The Hungarian Government supports the \r\nongoing work in that field, and once again reiterates its \r\nreadiness to make all its facilities available to the IAEA to \r\ncarry out the related tests and trials. \r\nIt is regrettable that the international community has \r\nagain been compelled, in the period under review, to deal \r\nwith problems endangering the integrity of the nuclear non- \r\nproliferation regime. In addition to the case of Iraq’s non- \r\ncompliance with its safeguards obligations, attention has \r\nhad to be paid to the ambiguous attitude of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea towards the Non-Proliferation \r\nTreaty and the safeguards agreement it concluded with the \r\nIAEA. \r\nI should like to express our appreciation to the \r\nAgency for all its work and efforts in the implementation \r\nof the Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq. We \r\nare convinced that the IAEA will soon be able to MiI its \r\nremaining tasks, including ongoing long-term monitoring \r\nand verification. \r\nThe Hungarian Government is gravely concerned at \r\nthe lack of progress in the implementation of the \r\nsafeguards agreement between the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the Agency. We deeply regret that \r\nthe IAEA has not yet been able to clarify the discrepancies \r\ndiscovered in the initial inventory of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. All the efforts made by the \r\nDirector General on the basis of the respective resolutions \r\nof the Board of Governors, including the requested access \r\nto additional locations and information, have so far not \r\nbeen successful. \r\nThe Hungarian Government continues to support the \r\nDirector General’s efforts to maintain the continuity of the \r\nAgency’s safeguards over the declared nuclear activities of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and to carry \r\nout consultations with it aiming at the full implementation \r\nof all the relevant resolutions. We expect the Government \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to f3fil its \r\nTreaty obligations without any preconditions and to \r\nrespond favourably to repeated appeals by the world \r\ncommunity to provide full transparency of all its nuclear \r\nactivities. We believe that such developments would \r\ncontribute, not only to the strengthening of the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime and to easing tensions and \r\nimproving security in the East Asian region, but also to the \r\nsecurity of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nitself. \r\nStrenuous efforts should lead - in the not-too-distant \r\nfuture, we hope - to a new international agreement on a \r\ncomprehensive ban on all nuclear explosions, The cut-off \r\nof the production of all weapon-grade fissile materials, \r\nsuch as plutonium and highly enriched uranium for \r\nweapons or other explosive devices, which has been \r\ndiscussed for many years, should also be achieved soon. \r\nSuch developments, as well as the expected release of the \r\nfissionable material from dismantled nuclear weapons and \r\nthe ever-growing amount of plutonium from the ongoing \r\nreprocessing of spent civilian fuel, require an effective \r\ninternational verification mechanism. \r\nIn our view, the Agency’s professional and technical \r\nknowledge and the experience it has accumulated during \r\nthe last 25 years in the field of verification-related \r\nsafeguards activity are of great value to the world \r\ncommunity, When searching for real solutions to the \r\nemerging new verification tasks of a nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation nature, such values should be properly \r\nand fully utilized. \r\nThe Hungarian Government appreciates the Agency’s \r\nwork in providing safety-related technical assistance to \r\nEastern and Central European countries. Its programme \r\nrelated to the safety of water-cooled and moderated reactor \r\nplants is truly of great importance to the safety- \r\nenhancement programme of our own nuclear power plant \r\nin Hungary. At the same time, taking into account the \r\ninternationally recognized good operational-safety record \r\nof that nuclear-power plant, the experience and knowledge \r\nof the Hungarian institutions could well be utilized in \r\ninternational efforts aimed at enhancing the safety of \r\nSoviet-designed reactors. \r\nWe also commend and support the Agency’s activity \r\non strengthening and improving the legal basis of nuclear \r\nsafety, including efforts to conclude the preparatory work \r\non a convention on nuclear safety, which is to be adopted \r\nat a diplomatic conference in 1994. \r\nBeing at the same time a recipient and a donor \r\ncountry, Hungary attaches great importance to the \r\nTechnical Assistance and Cooperation Fund of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. For the time being, \r\nour country is receiving technical assistance in matters of \r\nsuch fundamental importance for the Hungarian nuclear \r\nindustry as the evaluation of the earthquake resistance of \r\nour nuclear power plant and the implementation of our \r\nlong-term complex strategy for the management and final \r\ndisposal of radioactive wastes. On the other hand, the \r\nHungarian nuclear facilities are open, through the IAEA’s \r\ntraining and fellowship programme, to representatives from \r\ndeveloping countries in order to share with them \r\n22 Genernl Assembly - Forty-eighth session \r\nknowledge and experience in the peaceful application of \r\nnuclear energy. \r\nOur nuclear power plant continues to have great \r\neconomic, technical and social impact on the whole \r\ncountry, as almost one half of Hungary’s total net \r\nelectricity production is generated there, Ten years ago, \r\nHungary received significant assistance from the IAEA to \r\ndevelop the required technical, scientific and operational \r\nknow-how necessary for safe nuclear-power production. \r\nSince then, the Agency and its internationally recognized \r\nexperience have continued to be the most important \r\nprofessional source we can rely on in realizing our \r\npeaceful nuclear programme. \r\nMr. SHERBAK (Russian Federation) (interpretation \r\nfrom Russian): The delegation of the Russian Federation \r\nwould like to join the other delegations which have already \r\nexpressed their support for the annual report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for 1992. \r\nWhile commending what is being done by the Agency, we \r\nassociate its success particularly with what has been done \r\nby Mr. Hans Blix, who, as Director General of the IAEA, \r\nhas already proved himself to be a skilful organizer and an \r\nexperienced administrator. Russia supported the \r\nrecommendation of the Board of Governors to appoint him \r\nto this responsible and important post for an additional \r\nfour-year rerm. We wish him every possible success in his \r\nfurther work. \r\nThe world stepped from the cold war into a new era. \r\nPartnership is now replacing confrontation The quest for \r\npolitical solutions is becoming more and more consolidated \r\nas the only acceptable way of resolving both new and old \r\nconflicts. There are increasing possibilities for constructive \r\ncooperation between States in guaranteeing security and in \r\nresolving economic, scientific and technological problems. \r\nThere has been a tangible increase in the role of, and \r\npractical opportunities available to, international \r\norganizations, and, first and foremost, organizations such \r\nas the IAEA. The Agency, quite justifiably, is in the \r\nforefront of those who are seeking to resolve the general \r\nproblems facing mankind in satisfying its growing energy \r\nneeds and at the same time to provide safeguards to ensure \r\nthat these efforts, including international cooperation, are \r\ndirected to peaceful purposes. \r\nThe focal point in the whole range of nuclear \r\nproblems facing the human race is the finding of means to \r\nfurther strengthen the international regime relating to the \r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Of paramount \r\nimportance here is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. The Treaty has proved its effectiveness \r\nand efficacy in the reduction of nuclear weapons and is \r\nhaving a positive impact on political stability in the world. \r\nWe are convinced that those participating in the Second \r\nReview Conference on the Treaty, to be held in 1995, will \r\ntake the historic decision to extend it for an indefinite \r\nperiod. Russia will do everything it can to convert the \r\nTreaty into a genuinely universal international legal \r\ndocument, and it is confident that the Agency will make a \r\nnoteworthy contribution to constructively preparing for this \r\nmeeting. \r\nWe welcome the growing number of parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT), particularly Armenia, Belarus and other countries \r\nmembers of the Commonwealth of Independent States that \r\nhave recently acceded to the Treaty. We hope that other \r\ncountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, first \r\nand foremost Kazakhstan and Ukraine, will soon accede to \r\nthe NPT and place all their nuclear activities under IAEA \r\nsafeguards. \r\nOn the other hand, I must note the Treaty’s recent \r\ntribulations. The world community was deeply concerned \r\nby the decision of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. \r\nThat decision has now been suspended, which is a step in \r\nthe right direction. It is important that a complete review \r\nof the decision follow and that everything be done to \r\nenable the Agency to exercise full supervisory functions \r\nunder the NPT, as outlined in the current safeguards \r\nagreement between the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea and the IAEA. \r\nRadical changes on the international scene and \r\ngrowing trust between the nuclear States has made it \r\npossible not only to seek agreement on considerable \r\nreductions in nuclear weapons, but also to take \r\nqualitatively new steps in that direction, \r\nRussia has been and remains committed to the goal of \r\nbanning nuclear-weapon tests. We are pleased that the \r\nConference on Disarmament has at last reached agreement \r\non a decision in principle to commence multilateral talks \r\non a comprehensive test-ban treaty. \r\nRussia has been listening very carefully to new ideas \r\nput forward at this session concerning the cessation of \r\nproduction of fissionable materials for weapons purposes. \r\nMany of these are in basic accord with the Russian \r\nposition. We propose the commencement of focused talks \r\nat the Conference on Disarmament with a view to drafting \r\na multilateral agreement on the supervised cessation of \r\nproduction of fissionable materials for weapons purposes. \r\nWe consider that in the context of such an agreement all \r\nnuclear-weapon States would have to agree to place \r\nweapons-grade materials resulting from the destruction of \r\nthe eliminated nuclear weapons under international control \r\n45th meetine - Mondav. 1 November 1993 23 \r\nunder the auspices of the IAEA. In the interests of \r\ntratlspwency, Russia is prepared to exchange information \r\nin accordance with what has already been agreed \r\nconcerning the quantities of materials and the facilities in \r\nwhich they are stored. We are certain that agreement on \r\nthese matters would make. a great contribution to \r\nstrengthening the non-proliferation regime. \r\nIn Russia, we no longer manufacture weapons-grade \r\nuranium; a programme to cease production of weapons- \r\ngrade plutonium is now under way. \r\nAn outstanding feature of our new era is the real \r\nprogress that has been achieved in the field of nuclear \r\ndisarmament. Tens of thousands of warheads are now \r\nscheduled for dismantlement, and the fissionable material \r\nthus generated will amount to hundreds of tonnes. Without \r\nunderestimating the importance of international supervision \r\nof the storage of nuclear materials, we think it important \r\nthat such materials be used effectively, for constructive \r\npurposes. We in our country see tremendous potential in \r\nthe use of such materials to further the achievement of the \r\nfollowing priority tasks: nuclear disarmament and \r\nconversion; improving the safety of nuclear-power plants; \r\nsolving ecological problems; and supporting economic \r\nreform, \r\nRussia attaches special significance to the Agency’s \r\nefforts to enhance further its supervisory functions and its \r\nsafeguards system. IAEA supervision is an effective \r\ninternational confidence-building measure, and can provide \r\nstable conditions for the development of cooperation in the \r\npeaceful use of atomic energy. It is important for the \r\nIAEA to enjoy the unwavering support of the international \r\ncommunity in that endeavour. For our part, we shall \r\ncontinue consistently to favour continued enhancement of \r\nthe effectiveness of IAEA safeguards, including enabling \r\nthe Agency to carry out unannounced inspections. \r\nRussia has been actively cooperating with the Agency \r\nin another important sphere of activity: nuclear power, \r\nThe future of nuclear power in Russia must be viewed in \r\nthe context of our overall energy policy, which is currently \r\naligned with the new economic conditions in our country. \r\nThe Russian Federation also attaches great importance \r\nto promoting cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic \r\nenergy, particularly with other countries of the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States. As members know, \r\nthe Russian Federation has been working under the Minsk V \r\nAgreement to ensure safe management and international \r\nlegal regulation of existing peaceful nuclear facilities in \r\nRussia and in other States of the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States. We are particularly interested in the \r\nproposal to merge those efforts with similar IAEA efforts \r\nin the Commonwealth countries; here, in our view, the \r\nAgency could serve as coordinator. \r\nThe success of multilateral cooperation between the \r\nIAEA, Russia and the new States of the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States could be based on a common \r\nunderstanding by Commonwealth States of the economic \r\nsignificance of the use of nuclear energy, on a wish to \r\ncooperate in enhancing the safety of nuclear power, and on \r\nan awareness of their responsibility to the international \r\ncommunity with respect to resolving problems relating to \r\nnuclear power, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, \r\nthe environment, and nuclear and radiological safety. \r\nLike last year, we note with satisfaction that the IAEA \r\nhas successfully contended with its responsibilities in the \r\nfields of providing safeguards, promoting the development \r\nof peaceful uses of atomic energy, and furnishing technical \r\nassistance. I reaffirm that Russia will continue fully to \r\nsupport this important and authoritative international \r\nagency in all areas of its activities. \r\nMr. MARUYAMA (Japan): First of all, I would like \r\nto congratulate Mr. Hans Blix, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on his \r\nreappointment. I would like also to express my \r\ndelegation’s appreciation for the statement Mr, Blix made \r\nthis morning, in which he explained the major activities of \r\nthe Agency. \r\nIn our view, the draft resolution before the Assembly, \r\nof which Japan is a sponsor, reflects concisely and in a \r\nbalanced manner the basic tasks of the Agency as well as \r\nthe main issues currently pending. As the preambular part \r\ndescribes well, safeguards and nuclear safety are essential \r\nfor the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It is also \r\nappropriate to mention that developing countries have \r\nspecial needs for technical assistance, The individual \r\npriority areas are identified, in accordance with the \r\ntradition of the Agency, in the form of General Conference \r\nresolutions. The operative part of the draft resolution \r\nhighlights some of the current issues. \r\nI should like to take this opportunity to state our \r\nposition briefly on some points in connection with the draft \r\nresolution. \r\nFirst, on safety issues, my delegation notes with \r\nsatisfaction that the Agency provided, in a very timely \r\nfashion, safety assistance for the countries of the former \r\nSoviet Union and Eastern Europe. We attach importance \r\nto the drafting work, organized by the Agency, for a \r\nnuclear-safety convention, which is expected to enhance \r\nthe level of nuclear safety world-wide. I also wish to \r\nexpress our concern over Russia’s ocean dumping of \r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session \r\nradioactive waste. My delegation looks forward to the \r\nAgency’s contribution to tackling this problem. \r\nSecondly, on safeguards, we underline the Agency’s \r\neffort to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the \r\nefficiency of the safeguards system. In particular, the \r\nrecent cases of Iraq and the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea deserve special attention. The very credibility of \r\nthe safeguards system is at stake. I reiterate my \r\nGovernment’s firm support and appreciation for the \r\nAgency’s strenuous and painstaking efforts in this regard. \r\nMy Government, together with many others, strongly urges \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to retract \r\nimmediately its decision to withdraw from the \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and to implement frilly the \r\nsafeguards agreement. with the Agency and the Joint \r\nDeclaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean \r\nPeninsula. \r\nThirdly, as to technical assistance, it is my \r\nGovernment’s established policy to promote cooperation \r\nwith developing countries. The nuclear field is no \r\nexception. \r\nTo conclude, my delegation wishes to express its \r\nexpectation and sincere hope that the Agency will meet the \r\nchallenges it faces today and that it will continue to play \r\na significant role in the important field of furthering the \r\napplication of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \r\nMr. ELARABY (Egypt) (interpretation fom Arabic): \r\nIt gives me pleasure to welcome Mr, Hans Blix, Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), and to congratulate him both on his re-election \r\nand on the Agency’s achievements over the past year. \r\nThose achievements bear witness to the important and \r\nenhanced role the Agency plays in assisting the \r\ninternational community to deal with the nuclear threat \r\nand, in making it possible for all countries to benefit from \r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy, \r\nThe international order continues to undergo changes \r\nand developments that follow upon one another and \r\nprovide propitious opportunities for promoting \r\nnuclear-disarmament efforts and enhancing international \r\npeace and security. There is no doubt that the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, which must continue \r\nto assume more and more responsibilities, will take \r\nadvantage of the positive aspects of those international \r\ndevelopments while warding off any negative elements \r\nwhich may be involved. \r\nWith the review and extension conference of the \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) pending, we must redouble \r\nour efforts at the international level to ensure the \r\nuniversality of the Treaty. We must ensure the \r\ncommitment to renouncing the nuclear option by those \r\nStates that have not yet acceded to the WT. There can be \r\nno doubt that applying the Agency’s safeguards in the case \r\nof those States is an essential prerequisite of confidence- \r\nbuilding and the containment of the tensions that arise \r\nfrom the nuclear-arms race. \r\nEgypt welcomes South Africa’s openly declared \r\nrenunciation of the nuclear option and its readiness to \r\naccept IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities. This \r\nconstructive development in South Africa’s stance on the \r\nissue has gone hand in hand with progress now being made \r\ntowards a comprehensive political settlement and the \r\ndismantling of the apartheid regime, developments which \r\nwill ultimately lead to South Africa’s reintegration into the \r\nAfrican and international communities. \r\nThis gives rise to hope that similar progress may be \r\nachieved in the Middle East where efforts towards a \r\npolitical settlement are beginning to bear fruit. In this \r\nconnection, Egypt wishes to state that political progress \r\nmust be accompanied, if not preceded, by similar progress \r\ntowards a commitment by all States of the region to \r\nrenounce the option of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nespecially nuclear weapons. This will be achieved only \r\nthrough accession by all States of the region to the NPT or \r\nthrough the application of the IAEA safeguards to all such \r\nStates, without exception, as a prelude to their accession to \r\nthe Treaty. Undoubtedly, this will have a direct effect on \r\nthe promotion of mutual confidence and will strengthen the \r\nefforts now being deployed towards the establishment of \r\npeace. \r\nEgypt urges all States of the region to respect the \r\nresolution adopted by General Conference of the Agency \r\non 1 October last year regarding the application of the \r\nsafeguards regime in the Middle East. I take this \r\nopportunity to express Egypt’s deep appreciation of the \r\nAgency’s role in this context, a role which will continue to \r\nreceive our support. \r\nI also wish to express Egypt’s recognition of the \r\nAgency’s invaluable role in advising the African experts \r\nengaged in the drafting of a treaty on the denuclearisation \r\nof Africa at their last meeting in Harare. Egypt hopes that \r\nthe treaty will be adopted at the next session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nWhile such positive developments may give rise to \r\nhope, there are other international developments that \r\ncontinue to remind us of the perils of nuclear proliferation \r\nand of the need to strengthen the NPT regime without \r\ndelay, as well as the need to remedy its shortcomings- \r\nReasons for optimism include the Conference on \r\n45th meeting - Monday, 1 November 1993. 25 \r\nDisarmament’s decision last August to give its Ad Hoc \r\nCommittee a negotiating mandate for a comprehensive \r\nnuclear-test-ban Treaty. Egypt hopes that nuclear tests, be \r\nthey open or clandestine, will come to a complete halt. \r\nThere can be no doubt that the Agency will play a leading \r\nrole in providing the necessary technical assistance and \r\nadvice to the Conference, both in the areas of reviewing \r\nadherence to the Convention and of reviewing subsequent \r\nimplementation of its provisions. The approaching NPT \r\nReview Conference provides us with an opportunity to \r\nremedy the current shortcomings of the non-proliferation \r\nregime in order to encourage the Treaty’s c,ontinuance in \r\nforce and to dispel any fears on the part of Member States \r\nthat have renounced the nuclear option and yet continue to \r\nfeel threatened by the very weapons they have renounced. \r\nWe call upon all the States that have not done so yet, \r\nto accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Its universality \r\nand the guarantees it provides to non-nuclear-weapon \r\nStates against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons \r\nagainst them are likely to lead to the realization of its \r\nobjectives. We also call upon the States parties to the \r\nTreaty to continue to respect their commitments and to \r\nstrictly abide by them. \r\nIn recent years, we have clearly seen that the NPT \r\nregime with which the Agency is entrusted needs to be \r\nimproved and strengthened in order to ensure that the \r\nAgency’s tasks are seriously conducted. My delegation \r\npays tribute to the Agency’s endeavours in this respect, \r\nalthough, in the final analysis, it is the will of the \r\ninternational community which can make it possible to \r\nextend and strengthen provision of the Agency’s services \r\nto all without discrimination, \r\nFinally, I wish to conclude by voicing the hope that \r\nthe Agency will continue to make further achievements and \r\nwill receive from Member States their full support and \r\nsufficient resources that would enable it to discharge its \r\nweighty tasks. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m \r\n"
