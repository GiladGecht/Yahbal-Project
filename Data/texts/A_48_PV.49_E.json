"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n49th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nThursday, 4 November 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 16\r\nELECTIONS TO FILL VACANCIES IN SUBSIDIARY\r\nORGANS AND OTHER ELECTIONS\r\n(d) ELECTION OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH\r\nCOMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES: NOTE BY\r\nTHE SECRETARY-GENERAL (A/48/568)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: By its resolution 45/319 of\r\n21 December 1990, the General Assembly, on the proposal\r\nof the Secretary-General (A/45/890), elected\r\nMrs. Sadako Ogata as United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees for a three-year term of office beginning on\r\n1 January 1991.\r\nBy its resolution 47/104 of 16 December 1992, the\r\nGeneral Assembly decided to continue the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for a\r\nfurther period of five years from 1 January 1994.\r\nIn conformity with established procedure, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral proposes to the General Assembly that the term of\r\noffice of Mrs. Sadako Ogata as United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees be extended for a period of five\r\nyears, beginning on 1 January 1994 and ending on\r\n31 December 1998.\r\nMay I consider that the General Assembly approves that\r\nproposal, contained in document A/48/568?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like on behalf of the entire\r\nAssembly sincerely to congratulate Mrs. Sadako Ogata of\r\nJapan on the extension of her appointment as United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees for a period of five years,\r\nbeginning on 1 January 1994 and ending on\r\n31 December 1998.\r\nWe also wish to compliment the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees on the excellent\r\nwork it is doing in the area of servicing the needs of\r\nrefugees.\r\nMr. HATANO (Japan): On behalf of the Government\r\nand the people of Japan, I express my sincere\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, and to Mrs. Sadako Ogata on the occasion of\r\nMrs. Ogata’s nomination to a new five-year term as United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees.\r\nSince Mrs. Ogata assumed office three years ago the\r\ninternational situation has undergone dramatic change. The\r\neruption of conflicts and civil strife in many parts of the\r\nworld has resulted in unspeakable human suffering. The\r\nproblem of refugees has become one of the greatest threats\r\nto world peace and stability, and is thus one of the most\r\ndaunting challenges facing the United Nations. Throughout\r\nthis difficult time Mrs. Ogata has provided the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\r\nwith outstanding leadership, and my Government commends\r\nher for the excellent work she has done. We extend our best\r\nwishes for her future work.\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-87068 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.49\r\n24 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe Government of Japan also pays high tribute to the\r\nUNHCR for its efforts to address the refugee problem. I am\r\npleased to reaffirm our continued support for its\r\nhumanitarian activities.\r\nMr. ELARABY (Egypt): On behalf of the Government\r\nof Egypt, I would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations\r\nto the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,\r\nMrs. Sadako Ogata. Her unanimously approved nomination\r\nto a further term of five years is a tribute to the efforts she\r\nhas been exerting over the past three years. My delegation\r\nwould like to pay a high tribute to her dedication and total\r\ncommitment and to the work of the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\r\nOf late, conflicts have erupted in various parts of the\r\nworld. The numbers of refugees have no doubt doubled in\r\nthe past few years. I think that the whole international\r\ncommunity is fortunate to have Mrs. Ogata undertaking her\r\nvery important tasks.\r\nI would like to reiterate once more the heartfelt\r\ncongratulations of the Government of Egypt to Mrs. Ogata\r\non her unanimously approved nomination.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: That concludes our consideration\r\nof agenda item 16 (d).\r\nPROGRAMME OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have an announcement to make\r\nin connection with agenda item 15 (c), \"Election of five\r\nmembers of the International Court of Justice\", which the\r\nAssembly is scheduled to consider on Wednesday,\r\n10 November.\r\nI should like to draw the Assembly’s attention to the\r\nrelevant documents. First, document A/48/432, dated\r\n27 September 1993, sets out the composition of the Court\r\nand the procedure for the election in the General Assembly\r\nand in the Security Council. Secondly, document A/48/440,\r\ndated 14 October 1993, contains the curricula vitae of the\r\ncandidates. Thirdly, document A//48/433, dated\r\n27 September 1993, contains the list of candidates submitted\r\nwithin the required time for submission. Finally, documents\r\nA/48/555 and A/48/555/Add.1, dated 27 October 1993 and\r\n3 November 1993 respectively, contain additional\r\ninformation received after 31 August 1993, the required date\r\nfor submission.\r\nParagraph 1 of document A/48/555 contains additional\r\nnominations by national groups. Paragraph 2 of the same\r\ndocument indicates that the Tunisian National Committee has\r\nwithdrawn its nomination of Mr. Mohamed Lejmi.\r\nDocument A/48/555/Add.1 further indicates that\r\nMr. Bola Ajibola has withdrawn his candidature. Any\r\nadditional information that may be received will be issued in\r\na further addendum to the document.\r\nIn order to facilitate the preparation and conduct of the\r\nelection procedure, it would seem desirable that the\r\nAssembly have before it, as it has had in the past, a\r\nconsolidated and updated list of candidates. Accordingly, if\r\nthere is no objection, I shall request the Secretariat to issue\r\na consolidated and updated list of candidates so as to reflect\r\nall information received since the issuance of the original\r\nlist, thus facilitating the election process for all\r\nrepresentatives.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 24\r\nUNITED NATIONS NEW AGENDA FOR THE\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF AFRICA IN THE 1990s\r\n(a) REPORTS OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL\r\n(A/48/334, A/48/336 and Corr.1)\r\n(b) NOTE BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL\r\nTRANSMITTING A REPORT BY THE FOOD\r\nAND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE\r\nUNITED NATIONS (A/48/335 and Add.1)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to propose that the\r\nlist of speakers in the debate on this item be closed today at\r\n11 a.m.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I therefore request representatives\r\nwishing to participate in the debate to inscribe their names\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nMr. ELARABY (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI am honoured to speak here today, on behalf of the\r\nPresident of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), on\r\nthis important new agenda item, which entails a preliminary\r\nevaluation of the implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nThe exacerbation of the economic and social problems\r\nof Africa was the reason behind adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations Programme of Action for\r\nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development\r\n(UNPAARED), which was meant to be fully implemented\r\nover the period from 1986 to 1990. In September 1991 a\r\nfinal review of the progress achieved in that direction\r\nshowed that the implementation of the Programme had not\r\nrisen to the level of the international community’s\r\n49th meeting - Thursday, 4 November 1993 3\r\nexpectations, in general, or to that of Africa’s aspirations, in\r\nparticular.\r\nThe faltering international effort in facing up to the\r\npersistence and aggravation of the problems of African\r\ndevelopment led the General Assembly to adopt\r\nresolution 46/151, by consensus, on 18 December 1991. The\r\nresolution, which included the New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, was adopted in\r\nreaffirmation of the international community’s and the\r\nAfrican countries’ commitment to promote Africa’s social\r\nand economic development in the course of this decade,\r\nwithin the framework of the concepts and principles of\r\nshared responsibility and international partnership. The\r\nadoption of that resolution also highlighted the high priority\r\naccorded by the United Nations to the question of economic\r\nrecovery in Africa and to African development in general.\r\nMy delegation wishes to commend the three reports\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General under item 24 and to\r\nmake special mention of his efforts aimed at the full\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda. We hope that the\r\nimplementation of that Agenda will be stepped up so that, by\r\nthe end of the century, UN NADAF will have achieved all\r\nthat UNPAARED failed to achieve in the 1980s.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the Panel of\r\nHigh-level personalities on African development, and call for\r\nregular meetings by that consultative body and for the\r\ntransmittal of its conclusions and recommendations to the\r\nMember States.\r\nEgypt also welcomes the establishment, in\r\nimplementation of the recommendation by the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination (CPC), of a special\r\ncoordination unit that focuses on Africa and the least\r\ndeveloped countries. We call for providing the unit with all\r\nthe capabilities that would enable it to perform its role in\r\nfollowing up the implementation of the New Agenda. We\r\nalso welcome the establishment of a working group for\r\ninter-agency coordination under the chairmanship of the\r\nExecutive Secretary of the Economic Commission for\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe United Nations system has a long way to go yet\r\nbefore the new priorities embodied in the New Agenda\r\nbecome concrete realities. In the context of policies and\r\nstrategies pursued by a variety of agencies and funds\r\nthroughout the United Nations system, operational activities\r\nwithin the United Nations, as well as those pursued by the\r\nspecialized agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nmust all be geared towards the establishment of concrete\r\nprogrammes and projects, with the aim of implementing the\r\nNew Agenda and providing the required financial resources\r\nfor its proper functioning. In this connection, we stress the\r\nimportance of the roles performed by the Administrative\r\nCommittee on Coordination (ACC) and the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination (CPC), in strengthening the\r\noverall role of the United Nations in the implementation of\r\nthe New Agenda.\r\nIn addition to that major role of the United Nations\r\nsystem, I should like to call to mind the role played by the\r\nAfrican States in particular and the international community\r\nin general, in the context of the New Agenda commitments\r\nwhich call upon the African countries to continue to\r\nintensify their own development efforts. The African\r\ncountries have spared no effort in shouldering their own\r\nresponsibility for economic and social development in\r\nAfrica. Many African States are engaged in implementing\r\nmajor economic and political structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes aimed at democratization and effecting the\r\ntransition to market economies. Those same States have\r\nupheld human rights while strengthening the private sector,\r\nparing down public-sector expenditures seeking to ensure\r\nhuman development, and working for the protection of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nOver 30 African countries have committed themselves\r\nto carrying out structural-adjustment and economic-transition\r\nprogrammes. This endeavour, however, has generated\r\nadverse social effects that hit their peoples very hard and\r\nexceeded their ability to contain or mitigate the resultant\r\ndifficulties on their own. The efforts of the international\r\ncommunity thus far have not risen to the level of the\r\ncommitments outlined in the New Agenda or the aspirations\r\nof African countries, notably with regard to the target figure\r\nof 4 per cent set out in the New Agenda for aid that should\r\nbe channelled to Africa.\r\nAfrica is the only continent that suffers from declining\r\nflows of financial resources in the 1990s. In addition, there\r\nis the continued worsening of its external debt burden side\r\nby side with plummeting commodity prices, the inability of\r\nits products to penetrate the markets of the industrial\r\ncountries, the inability to diversify those products, the\r\ninadequacy of aid provided by the international community\r\nin the fight against the epidemic spread of various diseases\r\nsuch as malaria and AIDS as well as the spread of drought,\r\ndesertification, soil deterioration and the devastation caused\r\nby the plague of locusts. All these negative factors combine\r\nin seriously hampering the development efforts of African\r\nStates.\r\nWhile the international economy moves steadily towards\r\nintegration and the emergence of international trading blocs,\r\nAfrica is finding it very difficult to gain access to any of the\r\nnew groupings that are taking shape in the international\r\neconomy. The major challenge now facing Africa is the\r\nneed to achieve rates of economic growth that would qualify\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nit to catch up with the rapid pace of the international\r\neconomy so that it may become an active part of that\r\neconomy in the 1990s and thereafter. This will depend in\r\nlarge part on the increase of financial resource flows to\r\nAfrica, as called for by the New Agenda. Unfortunately,\r\nwhat we have now is the reverse. Those flows have\r\ndeclined from $18 million in 1990 to about $14 million in\r\n1992.\r\nThere is also a decline in Official Development\r\nAssistance (ODA) to Africa, notably in terms of what the\r\nmajor donors are providing. They are providing only\r\n0.33 per cent of their gross national product instead of the\r\n0.7 per cent target level. This goes hand in hand with the\r\nfeeble response of foreign capital to the enabling policies\r\nwhich many African countries have pursued with the aim of\r\ncreating a better climate for foreign investment. This is\r\ncompounded by the feeble brokerage role played by African\r\nbanks and insurance companies in mobilizing savings and\r\ninvestment capital. That role is insignificant indeed in\r\ncomparison with the role played in Asia, for instance, by\r\nAsian banks and insurance companies.\r\nAfrica’s worsening debt problem cannot be addressed\r\nin isolation from the need to increase the flows of financial\r\nresources to the continent. Africa’s growing external debt\r\nburden is one of the major obstacles blocking the required\r\nincrease in direct foreign investment. Consequently, the\r\ninternational community should accord a high priority to\r\naddressing that problem in a manner that would make it\r\npossible to rechannel the financial resources which are\r\nabsorbed by debt servicing to financing economic and social\r\ndevelopment in Africa. The debt problem must be dealt\r\nwith creatively and boldly. In so doing, we have to come to\r\ngrips with all the bilateral, multilateral and commercial debt\r\nproblems faced by the continent.\r\nThe delegation of Egypt wishes to highlight the\r\nnegative effects of deteriorating terms of trade and falling\r\ncommodity prices on the African countries. The resultant\r\ndecline in Africa’s export earnings has had a deleterious\r\neffect on Africa’s development efforts. Consequently, we\r\nsupport the suggestion in the relevant report by the\r\nSecretary-General to set up a diversification facility for\r\nAfrican commodities for an initial period of three to four\r\nyears, with resources of $US 50-75 million, although the\r\nfigures suggested seem modest enough, especially that the\r\nAmsterdam Fund has not managed to do for Africa as much\r\nas was hoped for. However, that Fund may still play a\r\nmajor role in providing financing for this new facility which\r\nwill not constitute a new bureaucratic structure as we\r\nsuggest that it should be set up within the framework of the\r\nAfrican Development Bank.\r\nWe also support the call for African States to set up\r\ncouncils for the diversification of their products at the\r\nnational level. Representatives of the Governments and the\r\nprivate sectors of those countries should participate in the\r\nproposed councils with a view to proposing diversification\r\nplans that may be incorporated in the overall diversification\r\nprogrammes.\r\nHaving spoken of the problems of trade, commodity\r\nprices and diversification, I should like to speak on one of\r\nthe important issues on the New Agenda, namely that of\r\nregional and subregional cooperation and integration in\r\nAfrica.\r\nAfrica has shaped its vision and aspirations in this\r\nrespect in the Abuja Agreement on the setting up of the\r\nAfrican economic community. The realization of that\r\nambition requires a great deal of efforts on the part of the\r\nAfrican countries and a great deal of support from the\r\ninternational community especially in the area consolidating\r\nthe economic and social infrastructures and strengthening the\r\ncapabilities of the African countries.\r\nEgypt has followed with a great deal of appreciation\r\nJapan’s initiative to convene an international conference on\r\nAfrican development. That initiative was launched in this\r\nvery Hall in November two years ago, in 1991. On 5 and\r\n6 October 1993, the Conference was held in Tokyo and we\r\nconsider that the declaration adopted contains a very strong\r\npolitical commitment on the part of Africa, to continue to\r\nwork for reform and development and on the part of the\r\ninternational community to continue to support Africa’s\r\nefforts in that direction. We call for follow up on the\r\nconclusions of the Tokyo Declaration, the implementation of\r\nits recommendations and for further initiatives along the\r\nsame lines with the participation of as many interested\r\nparties as possible.\r\nWe are at the threshold of the 21st century. We have\r\nbut a few years left in which the international community\r\nmust come to Africa’s assistance so that it may fall in step\r\nwith the other continents in their march toward the new\r\n21st century. All African States, and indeed all the members\r\nof the international community are urged not to miss that\r\nopportunity.\r\nEgypt, as the Chairman of the current session of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, calls upon the members of\r\nthe international community and upon international financial\r\ninstitutions, to set up their support for the development of\r\nAfrica for the few remaining years of the 1990s and urges\r\nthem all to meet their commitments made in the context of\r\nthe New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s, both in spirit and letter.\r\n49th meeting - Thursday, 4 November 1993 5\r\nI wish to conclude my statement by underscoring the\r\nfruitful ongoing cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Organization of African Unity. That cooperation gives\r\nconcrete form to the partnership we are calling for between\r\nregional and subregional organizations in implementing the\r\nNew Agenda. The African group is now engaged in drafting\r\na resolution on this important item that will be put before\r\nthe General Assembly at a later date, at which time we hope\r\nit will be adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. JARAMILLO (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for me to participate in this\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly, on behalf of the 130\r\ncountries members of the Group of 77 and the People’s\r\nRepublic of China, to discuss an issue of great importance\r\nto the third world, namely, the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nThe deepening economic and social crisis in Africa led\r\nthe General Assembly to adopt the New Agenda by\r\nconsensus in December 1990. The United Nations\r\nrecognized the need to give the subject of Africa a\r\npre-eminent place among its priorities for the decade. It\r\nrecognized the urgent need to create new mechanisms and\r\ngive new directions to secure the international support\r\nneeded to deal with the dramatic situation facing that\r\ncontinent. At the time it was expected that the New Agenda\r\nfor Africa would serve as a political catalyst to encourage\r\ngreater support among the international community.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly affords us a\r\nvaluable occasion to draw the world’s attention once again\r\nto the critical economic and social situation which the vast\r\nmajority of African countries continue to face. The\r\ncircumstances that prompted the adoption of the New\r\nAgenda continue to exist. If the persistent trends in that\r\nregion are not reversed, any prospect for the rehabilitation\r\nand development of its peoples will be out of the question.\r\nOn the contrary, the world will continue to witness privation,\r\nhunger and war, with all their painful consequences.\r\nThe economic and social conditions of the majority of\r\nAfrican countries have worsened in recent years. Their\r\nheavy debt burden, their excessive dependence on a few\r\ncommodities, the rapid population growth, the serious\r\ndeterioration of nutrition indices, the environmental\r\ndeterioration caused by recurring problems of drought and\r\ndesertification, the political instability and explosive internal\r\nconfrontations are only a sampling of the prevailing chronic\r\nsituation and the serious repercussions created by the\r\nincreasing marginalization of those countries in the world\r\neconomy. That sombre picture is even more alarming in\r\nsub-Saharan Africa. There, poverty and human suffering\r\nhave reached dimensions unknown in any other part of the\r\nworld.\r\nIt has been established that the number of malnourished\r\npeople in Africa could reach 250 million by the year 2000,\r\nthat is, a figure equivalent to 30 per cent of the population\r\nprojected for that region by that year. Even if the 6 per cent\r\naverage annual economic-growth target set by the Agenda\r\nfor Africa were achieved, 25 years would still be needed to\r\nreach an acceptable level of unemployment.\r\nAgainst this dramatic and complex situation the African\r\ncountries are taking their own action to implement the\r\ncommitments embodied in the New Agenda. Policies of\r\neconomic reforms, the promotion of subregional and regional\r\ncooperation, the quest for democratic processes, agricultural\r\ndevelopment and the establishment of suitable environmental\r\nand demographic policies are but a few examples of the\r\nchallenges with which those countries are grappling. The\r\ninternational community, however, has no less a\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe heavy and unbearable external debt burden of\r\nAfrican countries has led to a paradoxical situation in which\r\nthose same countries have become net exporters of capital to\r\ndeveloped countries and multilateral financial institutions.\r\nIn other words, the world’s poorest countries are transferring\r\ntheir scarce resources to finance the development of the\r\nrichest countries. The total value of production of the\r\nAfrican economies would barely be enough to cover the\r\namount of their indebtedness. In the sub-Saharan countries\r\nnot even three years’ worth of exports would cover the\r\namount of their debt. That situation has been aggravated by\r\nthe tangible drop in commodity prices and insufficient\r\ninvestment flows that have further affected the capacity of\r\nthose countries to meet their financial obligations and to go\r\nforward with their development programmes. Vast sectors\r\nof the African population continue to be deprived of a large\r\nvolume of resources that could otherwise be channelled to\r\nmeeting their urgent social needs. The definitive solution to\r\nAfrica’s debt problem should be an urgent priority in the\r\nagenda of the international community for that region.\r\nThe transformation and diversification of the African\r\neconomies constitute an indispensable condition for their\r\neffective integration into the world economy, for reducing\r\ntheir vulnerability and for launching a self-sustained process\r\nof growth. In turn, the diversified economic development of\r\nAfrica constitutes a fundamental prerequisite for achieving\r\na durable solution to its social problems and internal\r\nconflicts and for achieving a real and stable peace in that\r\nregion. The Secretary-General has submitted to this session\r\na study on the need for and feasibility of the establishment\r\nof a diversification fund for African commodities.\r\nUnfortunately, the late submission of the document may\r\naffect its discussion. We hope, however, that the\r\nrecommendations contained in the study will be given\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nextensive and serious consideration by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAnother area in which the African continent must be\r\nsupported by the international community is regional and\r\nsubregional integration. The African countries must join\r\nefforts to improve their own competitiveness in an age like\r\nour own, with its enlarged markets and increasing\r\nglobalization. The majority of the African economies are\r\nsmall in size. Their infrastructure and production facilities\r\nshould be shared in order to achieve greater competitiveness.\r\nRegional cooperation efforts and the strengthening of\r\ninstitutional capacity in this area must involve the United\r\nNations system, the Economic Commission for Africa and\r\nthe development banks.\r\nFull implementation of the New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa and adoption of the necessary\r\nmeasures by the international community - in particular, by\r\nthe developed countries, the United Nations and the\r\nmultilateral financial and development institutions - are\r\nindispensable if the agreed strategies are to be given a\r\ndecisive impetus. There should be constant follow-up to,\r\nand assessment of, the various instruments that have been\r\nagreed upon. An early review is necessary to ensure that all\r\nthe envisaged institutional machinery is functioning\r\nadequately and that the requested financial resources have\r\nindeed been allocated as scheduled and in the amounts\r\nrequired.\r\nAfrica is a continent of enormous potential. Its\r\ndiversity, wealth and human resources offer a glimmer of\r\nhope. We must reaffirm our confidence in the peoples of\r\nAfrica and help them to build their own future. The\r\ninternational community must share this responsibility\r\nthrough tangible commitments and specific measures. The\r\nimmense political significance of this undertaking should be\r\nexpressed in the form of a clear resolve on the part of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its reaffirmation that in the years to\r\ncome such problems be the central focus of attention of the\r\nmain multilateral forums. The full solidarity of the United\r\nNations is a fundamental need if the peoples of Africa will\r\nsee hope reborn.\r\nMr. LAMAMRA (Algeria) (interpretation from French):\r\nI should like first to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nexcellent report on the implementation of the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nThe useful and relevant information that it contains makes\r\na valuable contribution by setting the stage for our current\r\ndeliberations, as do the statements that have just been made\r\nby the representative of the current Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and by the Chairman\r\nof the Group of 77, whose views the Algerian delegation\r\ncompletely supports.\r\nThe inclusion of the economic recovery and\r\ndevelopment of Africa as one of the five major priorities set\r\nout in the medium-term plan of the United Nations and the\r\nadoption of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s mark a new beginning.\r\nFollowing a decade of dishonoured promises and clear-cut\r\nfailures, and taking account of the lessons learned from the\r\ndisappointing results of the United Nations Programme of\r\nAction for African Economic Recovery and Development\r\n1986-1990 (UNPAAERD), the New Agenda reflects the\r\ninternational community’s commitment to the building of a\r\npartnership of a new type to promote economic growth and\r\nlay the foundations for the continent’s lasting development.\r\nBased on an objective evaluation of the factors\r\nunderlying the failure of UNPAAERD, the New Agenda is\r\nmeant to be an unprecedented starting point in international\r\ncooperation for development by defining - this time very\r\nclearly - the shared, but differing, responsibilities and\r\ncommitments of the African countries themselves and the\r\ninternational community, within the framework of the\r\ncommon endeavour to revitalize the African economies.\r\nAnxious to be involved in the process of transition\r\nunder way in the world, and aware that all development\r\nstrategies must, above all, be based on self-reliance, and that\r\nthe support of the international community, however\r\nimportant, cannot be regarded as indispensable, the African\r\ncountries have undertaken to embark on a bold programme\r\nof political and economic reforms, often at extremely high\r\nsocial cost.\r\nAt the political level, efforts have been made to\r\npromote an orderly and steady transition to more democratic\r\nforms of government, a greater degree of mass participation\r\nand upgrading of human resources. At the continental level,\r\nthe recent establishment of machinery for the prevention and\r\nmanagement of conflicts arises from the will of the peoples\r\nof Africa to eradicate sources of tension and conflict, which\r\nare particularly detrimental to the continent’s economic\r\nrecovery.\r\nOn the economic front, profound transformations have\r\nbeen made for the purpose of promoting growth and lasting\r\ndevelopment. Ambitious but painful structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes have been initiated, primarily through the\r\nestablishment of frameworks for macroeconomic regulation,\r\nwith a view to encouraging the revival of growth and the\r\npromotion of investment and employment. Various\r\nmeasures designed to restore economic equilibrium and\r\nfinancial stability have already produced results in the shape\r\nof a reduction in the budget deficit, which dropped from\r\n12 per cent of gross national product in 1987 to 5 per cent\r\nin 1991. This trend continued in 1992, in spite of the\r\n49th meeting - Thursday, 4 November 1993 7\r\ndiversion of a considerable portion of internal resources to\r\nthe servicing of external debt.\r\nAt the same time, Africa has been striving to promote\r\nregional cooperation and economic integration. The Treaty\r\nthat created the African Economic Community, which was\r\nsigned in Abuja in June 1991, represents a most solemn\r\nexpression, at the highest level, of the will of the African\r\ncountries to take control of their own destinies by exploiting\r\nthe continent’s capacities and talents. The Treaty is well on\r\nthe way to being ratified by sufficient countries to come into\r\nforce.\r\nIt should be pointed out that this continental endeavour\r\nis just a continuation of the work begun at the subregional\r\nlevel, where integration machinery has existed in some cases\r\nfor several decades and in others for just a few years. It is\r\ntrue that the achievements of these instruments of\r\nsubregional cooperation remain modest, but the dynamic to\r\nstrengthen their capacity to act has now been unleashed\r\nthrough a review of their statutes with a view to more\r\neffective functioning and a better adaptation to the new\r\nobjectives given them as pillars of the undertaking to bring\r\nabout continental integration.\r\nThus many gains have been registered in the Maghreb\r\nregion since the foundation of the Arab Maghreb Union. A\r\nnumber of sectoral cooperation protocols have been signed,\r\nand institutional machinery has been set up and has now\r\ncome into operation. This has all helped to give the Arab\r\nMaghreb Union the status of a partner recognized and valued\r\nby the other African regional institutions and by the\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nThe Southern African Development Coordination\r\nConference, the preferential trade zone of central and eastern\r\nAfrican countries and the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States are other means of support for Africa in its\r\ndetermination to exploit subregional complementarities as\r\npart of the process of building the African Economic\r\nCommunity.\r\nBecause they are being made in a particularly\r\nunfavourable international economic environment, and\r\nbecause consistent external assistance is lacking, the efforts\r\nof the African countries, however praiseworthy, have not in\r\nthemselves proved sufficient to reduce, or at least mitigate,\r\nthe multidimensional crisis affecting the continent. In spite\r\nof the enormous sacrifices that have been made, the African\r\neconomy in the first two years of this decade grew at\r\nscarcely more than 2 per cent, and per capita income\r\ndecreased in 1992, as it did every year since the beginning\r\nof the 1980s.\r\nThe total African debt went up to $288 billion in 1992,\r\nwhich represents an increase of 2.5 per cent on average\r\nbetween 1990 and 1992, and 7.7 per cent for the\r\nsub-Saharan region alone. Africa, which has the highest\r\nratios of debt to levels both of gross national product and of\r\nexports, continues to devote more than 30 per cent of its\r\nexport earnings to servicing external debt.\r\nThe Secretary-General had estimated that a minimum of\r\n$30 million in public assistance for development would be\r\nnecessary in 1992 if the African countries were to achieve\r\nand maintain in the 1990s the relative growth of 6 per cent\r\nset down as the target by the New Agenda. However, the\r\ncombined total of net financial resources flowing towards the\r\ncontinent remained below the $20 billion level, and the net\r\ntransfer of resources, which had in recent years become\r\npositive in other developing regions of the world, had a\r\nnegative record of $1.6 billion in 1992 with regard to Africa.\r\nThe stagnation, imbalances and uncertainty\r\ncharacteristic of international trade bring into greater relief\r\nthe growing marginalization of Africa, which is due not only\r\nto the continuing decline in primary commodity prices but\r\nalso to the restrictions imposed on access to the markets of\r\nthe countries of the North.\r\nCommodity prices, which represent about 90 per cent\r\nof African exports, have indeed experienced an appreciable\r\ndrop of 4 per cent in 1992 in comparison to 1991, and\r\nexports have stagnated. This all has led to a reduction in\r\nAfrica’s share in international trade.\r\nWhile the African countries have, to a large extent,\r\nshouldered an important share of their responsibilities and\r\nremain determined to continue and intensify their\r\ndevelopment efforts, the international community must for its\r\npart redouble its efforts to make up for lost time and see to\r\nthe rapid materialization of its commitments.\r\nWithout the substantial contribution of additional\r\nfinancial resources adequate to the tasks at hand, the\r\neconomic reforms and adjustment programmes under way\r\nwill necessarily be longer and more difficult, and ultimately\r\nliable to exacerbate even further economic imbalances and\r\ndangerously fuel social and political tensions in a number of\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nIt is the duty of the international community, therefore,\r\nto promote innovative and bold action within the framework\r\nof a lasting and global solution such as effectively to resolve\r\nthe African continent’s external debt crisis. The measures\r\ncontemplated in the New Agenda, which advocate\r\ncancellations and/or substantial reductions in both public and\r\ntrade debt as well as the interest on it, should be taken\r\nimmediately. In this context, the proposal to hold an\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ninternational conference on African external debt, although\r\nlongstanding, is just as relevant as ever, as it would be likely\r\nto promote a better overall understanding of the phenomenon\r\nof African external debt and to promote appropriate\r\nsolutions.\r\nTo help African countries, whose external earnings\r\ncontinue to depend on a small number of basic commodities,\r\nand to revitalize their export sectors, resolute action should\r\nbe taken to bring about a greater diversification of their\r\neconomies as well as to establish concerted machinery\r\npromoting more remunerative prices and an orderly\r\nregulation of the evolution of these prices. The\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General with regard to the\r\nestablishment of a diversification fund for African\r\ncommodities, as advocated by the New Agenda, should in\r\nthis regard be followed up rapidly. It is important, therefore,\r\nfor the General Assembly to take the decision at this session\r\nto create this modest and pragmatic machinery, which is\r\ndesigned to act as a catalyst in mobilizing resources from all\r\npossible sources. The Assembly would thus be registering\r\nits determination to see to it that the New Agenda embarks\r\non the road to implementation.\r\nThe developed countries should feel it their duty to\r\nimprove the access of African exports to their markets by\r\nagreeing to eliminate a number of tariff and other barriers to\r\nmore equitable trade relations. This goal necessarily requires\r\na rapid conclusion to the Uruguay Round negotiations, and\r\nwe hope that these will pave the way for the establishment\r\nof an open and non-discriminatory international trade system\r\nand promote the effective integration of African countries\r\ninto the world economy.\r\nThe international community should also adopt rapidly\r\nthe necessary measures to encourage direct foreign\r\ninvestment in African countries and also to support the\r\nefforts of the African countries to create sufficiently\r\nencouraging legislation.\r\nThe New Agenda for the Development of Africa is a\r\ncontract of solidarity between the international community\r\nand Africa. This New Agenda calls for sacrifices on the\r\npart of all. The United Nations and all the agencies in the\r\nsystem cannot remain outside the concerted effort to bring\r\nabout true economic recovery in Africa. The establishment\r\nby the Secretary-General of a Panel of High-level\r\nPersonalities on African development demonstrates the\r\ncommitment of our Organization to the cause of the\r\ndevelopment of the continent and also its determination to\r\nharmonize all the energies of the specialized agencies within\r\na coherent endeavour to implement the New Agenda.\r\nThe Economic Commission for Africa has in this regard\r\nan important role to play both in educating the international\r\ncommunity as to the priority to be given to the needs of\r\nAfrica and in the coordination of the activities of the\r\nrelevant institutions that are involved in the work of\r\ndevelopment throughout the African continent. Greater\r\ninteraction is also expected between the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa and the Organization of African\r\nUnity, particularly in terms of assistance for the methodical\r\nimplementation of the Abuja Treaty.\r\nWith this in mind, it is important for the General\r\nAssembly to invest more of its authority in this vast project\r\nand for the programme budget it will examine shortly to\r\ndistinguish, in terms of priority and resources, the many and\r\nvaried activities called for by the need to make the efforts to\r\nimplement the New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nmore dynamic.\r\nMr. MONGBE (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s is for us Africans\r\none of the chief items on the agenda of this, the forty-eighth,\r\nsession of the General Assembly, which you, Sir, have been\r\npresiding over with great competence and skill since work\r\nbegan on 21 September.\r\nBefore I share with you some thoughts my delegation\r\nhas to offer in the context of this debate, I should like to say\r\nthat we support the statements delivered by the\r\nrepresentative of the current Chairman of the Organization\r\nof African Unity, Ambassador Elaraby, of Egypt, and by the\r\nPresident of the Group of African States for the month of\r\nNovember, Ambassador Lamamra of Algeria. Finally, I\r\nwould, like on behalf of my country, to convey our profound\r\ngratitude to Ambassador Jaramillo, of Colombia, who has\r\njust expressed from this rostrum the sincere and unqualified\r\nsupport of the Group of 77, this group of 130 countries, for\r\nthe legitimate request of African States for better\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda.\r\nLast year, in the course of the forty-seventh session of\r\nthe General Assembly, the African delegations voiced their\r\ndisquiet and their concern at the lethargy that characterized\r\nthe launching of the implementation of the New Agenda\r\nsince its establishment under resolution 46/151 of\r\n18 December 1991.\r\nJust a few days after the suspension of the forty-seventh\r\nsession, the Secretary-General presided over the first meeting\r\nof the Group of High-Level Personalities on the\r\nDevelopment of Africa, which he convened and which was\r\nheld in Geneva on 28 December 1992. That first meeting\r\nwas followed by a second, with Rome as its venue, on 17\r\nand 18 April 1993.\r\n49th meeting - Thursday, 4 November 1993 9\r\nAt these gatherings the focus was on the following\r\nissues: Africa’s external debt; diversification of the African\r\neconomies; regional and subregional economic integration in\r\nAfrica; improvement in the coordination of activities of\r\nnon-governmental organizations at the level of governments,\r\nand activities within the United Nations system for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the fact that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral did indeed heed the appeal made by the African\r\ndelegations at the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly in the course of the general debate by convening\r\nand directing in person the two Meetings of the Group of\r\nHigh-Level Personalities for the Development of Africa.\r\nMy delegation also appreciates the importance of the\r\nother four key issues addressed at these two meetings.\r\nHowever, we feel that the picture would have been more\r\ncomplete still had the matters of food security, human\r\nresources training and the strengthening of national\r\ncapacities also been examined there.\r\nWe note with great concern that outside the holding of\r\nthese two meetings and the publication of the New Agenda\r\nas a document, no other step was taken until this, the forty-\r\neighth, session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe three documents submitted to us for analysis at this\r\nsession - the report of the Secretary-General (A/48/334) on\r\nthe preliminary consideration of the implementation of the\r\nNew Agenda, the study on the need for and feasibility of the\r\nestablishment of a diversification fund for Africa’s\r\ncommodities (A/48/335 and Add.1), and the special study on\r\nfinancial flows to Africa (A/48/336 and Corr.1) - were\r\npublished so late that it was impossible to solicit the views\r\nand the observations of our capitals, which would have\r\nenhanced the contributions our African delegations are able\r\nto make to the implementation of the New Agenda.\r\nMy delegation would like at this point to offer some\r\ncomments and suggestions.\r\nWe wish to lend our support to the concept of setting\r\nup a diversification fund for Africa’s commodities within the\r\nAfrican Development Bank in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, for an\r\ninitial period of three to four years, and endowing it with an\r\ninitial allotment of resources amounting to $50 million to\r\n$75 million, for the purpose of helping African countries\r\nwork out diversification programmes and projects for their\r\ncommodities.\r\nBenin would also like to support the proposal\r\nconcerning the creation within each African country of a\r\nnational diversification council, whose functions could\r\ninclude the elaboration and evaluation of diversification\r\nprojects, taking into account the structural and institutional\r\nsituation as well as available infrastructure and human\r\nresources.\r\nHowever, we must emphasize that the effectiveness and\r\nthe success of such a commodity diversification fund will\r\nhinge on the progress made in solving existing problems in\r\ncertain crucial areas, such as Africa’s external debt,\r\nincreasing official development assistance, providing fresh\r\nadditional resources, increasing direct foreign investment,\r\npromoting small- and medium-scale industries and\r\nbusinesses, and the transfer and adaptation of technology for\r\nthe processing of commodities, supported by the\r\nestablishment or the strengthening of existing research and\r\ndevelopment structures guaranteeing in the long term the\r\nsuccessful diversification of African economies.\r\nSuccess in diversification also depends on the measures\r\nto be envisaged in political, geographical and structural\r\nterms to change the current patterns of trade in Africa which\r\nare impeding South-South trade cooperation in general and\r\nintra-African trade cooperation in particular.\r\nThe special study on the flow of finances to Africa\r\nshows the inadequacy of direct foreign investment in Africa\r\nin general, and in sub-Saharan Africa in particular, the\r\nweakness in the mobilization of national resources, both\r\npublic and private, the low level of savings and the drop in\r\nofficial development aid.\r\nThe political and economic reforms undertaken by\r\nAfrican States are not enough to bring about a lasting\r\nsolution. By adopting General Assembly resolution 46/151\r\non 18 December 1991 the international community\r\ncommitted itself to supporting the efforts made by Africa to\r\nspeed growth and to achieve lasting, sustainable development\r\nfocused on people. This support should now translate into\r\nspecific, visible and tangible actions, measures and\r\nachievements like those carried out in other hard-hit regions\r\nof our planet.\r\nFinancial resources in adequate amounts were to be\r\nprovided to Africa so that its gross national product might\r\nreach an annual growth rate of 6 per cent, for which a net\r\namount of $30 billion in official development assistance\r\nwould have been required in 1992, along with a rise in the\r\ngrowth rate to an average of 4 per cent per annum,\r\naccording to the New Agenda (General Assembly resolution\r\n46/151, annex, part II, para. 29). Unfortunately, such\r\nresources still have not materialized even today, as 1993 is\r\ndrawing to a close. This situation is oddly reminiscent of\r\nwhat happened to the United Nations Programme of Action\r\nfor African Economic Recovery and Development, whose\r\ncrushing failure - caused by the lack of financial resources\r\nand also by its faulty conception - prompted us to negotiate\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s.\r\nWithin the United Nations system, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/48/334) on the preliminary examination\r\nof the implementation of the New Agenda shows that no\r\nlarge-scale measures have been launched for some two years\r\nnow. Indeed, the Bureau of the United Nations Special\r\nCoordinator for Africa and the least developed countries is\r\ncontinually suffering from a lack of financial and human\r\nresources needed to fulfil its task of following up on and\r\neffectively implementing the New Agenda, even though the\r\nGeneral Assembly clearly declared that the development of\r\nAfrica was one of the five United Nations priorities for the\r\n1990s.\r\nFaced with the alarming situation caused by the United\r\nNations system in the implementation of the New Agenda,\r\nas a result of the markedly late launching of its\r\nimplementation, my delegation wishes urgently to call on the\r\nSecretary-General to invite all the bodies, agencies, and\r\nlevels of authority throughout the United Nations system to\r\nincorporate the priorities of the New Agenda into their\r\nrespective mandates as soon as possible, and to allocate the\r\nresources required to implement these priorities in\r\naccordance with the concept of additionality, which is the\r\nunderpinning of this Agenda, and keeping in mind the five\r\nUnited Nations priorities for the 1990s.\r\nThe incorporation of these priorities and the allocation\r\nof adequate resources by the United Nations system will\r\nmake possible some progress, which can be built upon and\r\nimproved both by the recommendations emerging from the\r\nhigh-level Economic and Social Council debate in 1995 to\r\nbe devoted to implementation of the New Agenda and by the\r\ndecisions and resolutions to be adopted in 1996, when the\r\nGeneral Assembly will proceed to a mid-term review of the\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda.\r\nBeyond that, in the context of the implementation and\r\nfollow-up work to be carried out by the United Nations\r\nsystem and by Africa, the Bureau of the Special Coordinator\r\nfor Africa and the Least Developed Countries should in 1994\r\norganize seminars and workshops on the priorities spelled\r\nout in the New Agenda, at the level of each of the five\r\nsubregions within Africa. Implementing these priorities for\r\nthe economic recovery and development of Africa will thus\r\npass from a pious hope to the level of reality. These\r\nseminars and workshops should be organized in close\r\nconcert with the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the\r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA),\r\nand the subregional economic communities: the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States (ECCAS),\r\nthe Central African Customs and Economic Union\r\n(CACEU), the Southern Africa Development Community\r\n(SADC), the Preferential Trade Area of Eastern and\r\nSouthern African States (PTA) and the Arab Maghreb Union\r\n(AMU).\r\nWe hardly wish to harbour illusions. The New Agenda\r\nwill not attain the expected success if adequate resources are\r\nnot mobilized, if the international community does not\r\nhonour its commitment and if the United Nations system\r\ndoes not play its role correctly. At the same time, Africa\r\nmust pursue its own political and economic reforms and\r\nensure the effective functioning of the follow-up, monitoring\r\nand evaluation mechanisms of the New Agenda.\r\nThe end of the cold war and the prospect of building a\r\nmore effective and efficient United Nations in the realm of\r\neconomic and social development gives us reason to hope\r\nthat the New Agenda can achieve success. Africa has the\r\nright and the duty to enter the twenty-first century on an\r\nequal footing with the rest of the world and not lagging\r\nbehind, as might be predicted on the basis of the current\r\nsituation, which we all deplore and which together we must\r\nresolutely correct.\r\nMr. SEYDOU (Niger) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe consideration of agenda item 24, \"United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\", gives\r\nmy delegation a new opportunity to contribute to the work\r\nof the forty-eighth session.\r\nMy delegation wholeheartedly endorses the statement on\r\nthis subject made on behalf of Africa by\r\nAmbassador Elaraby, representing the current Chairman of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity. It would also like to\r\ncongratulate and thank the Ambassador of Colombia, who\r\noffered the support and contribution of the Group of 77 to\r\nthe efforts of the international community.\r\nHowever, I join previous speakers in expressing my\r\nconcern and anxiety over the evolution of the\r\nimplementation of this new programme for Africa. It will\r\nbe recalled that at the end of the application of the United\r\nNations Programme of Action for African Economic\r\nRecovery and Development 1986-1990, the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-sixth session adopted resolution 46/151\r\non the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s.\r\nIn paragraph 43 of part II of the annex, the resolution\r\ncalls for a preliminary consideration of the implementation\r\nof the New Agenda during the forty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Two years after the adoption of this text\r\nand the new commitment made by the international\r\ncommunity, we cannot help but note how slow\r\nimplementation has been.\r\n49th meeting - Thursday, 4 November 1993 11\r\nIt is true that spectacular results could not have been\r\nachieved so quickly. Nevertheless, a few decisive initiatives\r\nwould at least have assured us of the new interest of the\r\nworld in the socio-economic difficulties which continue to\r\nafflict the African countries.\r\nUnfortunately, the situation in Africa has not changed\r\nover the last two years. It is hardly necessary to remind the\r\nAssembly that the New Agenda was adopted because of the\r\nexternal debt crisis, the steady decline in commodity prices,\r\nthe consequences of structural adjustment reforms, the\r\ndeterioration of the environment, the reduction by more than\r\n80 per cent of capital flows to Africa, and natural\r\ncatastrophes.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 3 of resolution 46/151,\r\nthe African countries have adopted bold measures to\r\nimprove the management of their economies. They have\r\nembarked upon a process of democratization, which is still\r\nunder way in certain countries and which has been\r\ncompleted in others. The human dimension of development\r\nis being taken into account more than ever in all decisions\r\ntaken by African leaders. Questions of environment,\r\npopulation, self-sufficiency in food, development of human\r\nresources and improvement of the living conditions of the\r\nmost vulnerable sectors of society are at the very heart of\r\nthe priorities adopted by African Governments.\r\nIt still remains, however, for the international\r\ncommunity to support Africa’s efforts to accelerate growth\r\nand ensure development which is focused on the human\r\nbeing, in a lasting and sustained fashion. The African\r\ncountries would have been much encouraged by the\r\nassistance of the international community in the\r\nimplementation of three priority areas defined by the\r\nSecretary-General following the high-level meeting in\r\nGeneva last December: external debt, regional and\r\nsubregional integration and diversification of the economies\r\nof African countries.\r\nOf course, there have been some positive actions which\r\nwe cannot overlook. Thus we welcome the international\r\nconferences and high-level meetings organized by the United\r\nNations in an attempt to refocus the attention of the\r\ninternational community on Africa. We welcome the\r\nConference on the development of Africa organized by the\r\nJapanese Government on 5 and 6 October last. This\r\nConference was an opportunity for Japan and the\r\ninternational community to undertake to improve the rate of\r\nofficial development assistance. The forum to be organized\r\nin Indonesia in 1994, which will bring together\r\nrepresentatives of African countries and foreign investors,\r\nagain upon the initiative of the Japanese Government, is a\r\nfurther aspect of this welcome progress. We also welcome\r\nthe feasibility study report on a diversification fund for\r\nAfrica’s commodities which has just been presented to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nNiger also welcomes all the actions the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has taken through the Bureau of the Special\r\nCoordinator for Africa and the Least Developed Countries to\r\nkeep Africa at the centre of United Nations concerns\r\nthroughout the Decade.\r\nBut we consider that much remains to be done: we are\r\nfar from achieving the goals of the New Agenda for Africa.\r\nWe firmly believe that without an integrated approach to\r\nresolve Africa’s multisectoral problems, the region will\r\ncontinue to encounter serious obstacles to the achievement\r\nof its objectives.\r\nThe measures set out in the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s are\r\nmore relevant than ever before. Niger appeals to the\r\ninternational community to begin implementing its own\r\ndecisions. Niger calls on the developed countries to devote\r\na portion of the resources freed by the reduction of military\r\nexpenditures to the growth and socio-economic development\r\nof the African countries. The international financial\r\ninstitutions too can contribute to these efforts by increasing\r\ntheir financial support for the African countries on\r\nfavourable terms.\r\nWe would like to see greater involvement by\r\nnon-governmental organizations, and the organization of\r\nseminars in Africa and elsewhere with a view to increasing\r\npublic awareness. In that connection we appeal to the\r\nSecretary-General to enable the Bureau of the Coordinator\r\nto take action to educate the peoples of Africa and of the\r\ndeveloped world on the need to implement the New Agenda\r\nfor Africa.\r\nLet me conclude, Mr. President, by congratulating you\r\non the remarkable skill, ability and intelligence with which\r\nyou are guiding the work of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. CHEN Jian (China) (interpretation from Chinese):\r\nBoth the report of the Secretary-General and the speeches\r\ndelivered by the representatives of many African countries\r\ntoday, and in particular the statement made on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China by the representative of Colombia,\r\ncurrent Chairman of that Group, have shown clearly that in\r\nthe past two years the countries and peoples of Africa have\r\nmade tremendous efforts in implementing General Assembly\r\nresolution 46/151. They have carried out adjustments and\r\nreforms in line with their national conditions, and have\r\nshown a vigorous spirit of seizing the opportunity for\r\ndevelopment.\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nRegrettably, as is pointed out by the Secretary-General\r\nin his report, most African countries remain in a perilous\r\nsituation marked by rising indebtedness, rapid population\r\ngrowth, stagnant exports, a long-term fall in per capita\r\nincome and a sharp deterioration in the nutritional situation.\r\nThe implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s is still faced with\r\nnumerous challenges. One of these is diversification of\r\nexport commodities, aimed at strengthening food security,\r\nimproving the sustainability of production, increasing export\r\nearnings and promoting development.\r\nThe report has also helped us see that in the course of\r\nimplementing the New Agenda there has been a sharper\r\ncontrast between the unremitting efforts of the African\r\ncountries and the lack of powerful support from the\r\ninternational community. This is indicated particularly by\r\nthe fact that the request for stabilizing the prices of export\r\nproducts in African countries has yet to be met; the trade\r\nprotectionism practised by the developed countries is still on\r\nthe rise; financial flows to Africa have decreased; and the\r\nreduction and exemption of the debts of African countries\r\nare far below the expected level.\r\nThe developed countries’ failure to fulfil their\r\nobligations and commitments and the increasingly\r\ndeteriorating world economic environment have undermined\r\nthe endeavours of the African countries and offset the\r\nbenefits produced by the New Agenda. That situation must\r\nbe changed. Development in Africa must be achieved\r\nthrough the concerted efforts and sincere cooperation of the\r\nAfrican people and the international community. It needs\r\nboth a strong driving force within the African countries and\r\na powerful impetus from outside. Economic restoration and\r\ngrowth in Africa not only has a direct bearing on long-term\r\nstability in African countries, but also affects the stable and\r\nhealthy development of the entire world economy.\r\nIn order further to implement the New Agenda, we\r\nbelieve, first, that the international community, and\r\nespecially the developed countries, should attach more\r\nimportance to the New Agenda, and that their commitments\r\nto the implementation of the New Agenda should be\r\ntransformed from words into practice. In particular, they\r\nshould mobilize adequate external resources and fulfil their\r\nobligations in such fields as commodity, trade and debt.\r\nSecondly, we believe that the constructive\r\nrecommendations in the Secretary-General’s report in favour\r\nof the African countries’ efforts to implement the New\r\nAgenda, including the recommendation to set up a\r\ndiversification facility for African commodities within the\r\nAfrican Development Bank, should receive active support\r\nand an active response.\r\nThirdly, we believe that, while it is true that the\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda is not going to be plain\r\nsailing and cost-free, backward economies and weak\r\nfoundation have made the African countries fairly vulnerable\r\nwith respect to withstanding the risks and pressures resulting\r\nfrom rapid change. As we support the African countries in\r\nachieving the objectives of the New Agenda, we must fully\r\nunderstand their different national conditions, respect their\r\nchoices of development strategies and policies, avoid or\r\nreduce as much as possible the turbulence and negative\r\neffects that might be produced by certain measures, reduce\r\nthe social costs of reforms and achieve the best\r\ncomprehensive economic and social returns.\r\nFourthly, we believe that the United Nations system\r\nshould play a positive role in implementing the New\r\nAgenda; the relevant United Nations organizations and\r\nspecialized agencies should formulate and implement\r\nprojects related to the New Agenda, inject adequate financial\r\nresources, provide strong support to regional and subregional\r\neconomic and technical cooperation in Africa, supervise\r\nmore closely the implementation of the New Agenda and\r\nimprove the quality of evaluation.\r\nThe Government and the people of China attach great\r\nimportance to economic development and social progress in\r\nAfrican countries. Strengthening unity and cooperation with\r\nthird-world countries, including African countries, is the\r\ncornerstone of China’s foreign policy. We will, as always,\r\ncontinue to strengthen exchanges and various forms of\r\ncooperation with African countries in the economic, trade\r\nand technical fields, and contribute, to the best of our ability,\r\nto the achievement of the objectives of the New Agenda.\r\nMr. MARUYAMA (Japan): First of all, my delegation\r\nwould like to express its appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the reports he has prepared on this very\r\nimportant issue. Among the extensive and valuable\r\ninformation they present is background on the adoption of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s, descriptions of the past and current\r\npolitical, economic, and social situation of African countries,\r\nand an assessment of the progress of efforts to implement\r\nthe New Agenda at the national, regional, and international\r\nlevels, as well as at the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation has nothing to add to this information,\r\nand I should therefore like to limit my remarks to the subject\r\nof the Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment. The Conference was hosted by the Japanese\r\nGovernment, with the United Nations and the Global\r\nCoalition for Africa as co-organizers. It concluded\r\nsuccessfully with the adoption of the Tokyo Declaration on\r\nAfrican Development, entitled \"Towards the 21st Century\".\r\nCopies of the Declaration, which have already been provided\r\n49th meeting - Thursday, 4 November 1993 13\r\nto the Second Committee, may be obtained from the\r\nJapanese Mission.\r\nThe Conference was attended by some 400 participants\r\nfrom 48 African countries, 13 major donor countries and 10\r\ninternational organizations. In addition, more than 30\r\ncountries and international organizations were present as\r\nobservers. Some African countries were represented by\r\nHeads of State, and many countries were represented at the\r\nministerial level. On behalf of my Government, I should\r\nlike to take this opportunity to reiterate my deepest gratitude\r\nto all of them for their contributions to the success of the\r\nConference.\r\nThe Declaration, which contains sections on political\r\nand economic reforms, economic development through\r\nactivities of the private sector, regional cooperation and\r\nintegration, emergency relief and development, Asian\r\nexperience and African development, international\r\ncooperation and follow-up, fully reflects the discussions that\r\ntook place in the course of the two-day gathering. Because\r\nof time constraints, I shall not attempt to summarize them\r\nhere. However, there are three points I should like to make.\r\nFirst, the discussions at the Conference were undertaken\r\nin a very constructive manner and in a spirit of partnership.\r\nAt the opening session, His Excellency Sir Ketumile Masire,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Botswana and Co-Chairman of\r\nthe Global Coalition for Africa, noted that African countries\r\nwere fully conscious of their responsibility for formulating\r\nand implementing political and economic reform\r\nprogrammes that would put them on the path of sustained\r\nand equitable growth, and he called on development partners\r\nto support these reform efforts on the basis of a new and\r\nstrengthened partnership. Similar views were expressed by\r\na number of participants from African countries and their\r\npartners. This spirit of partnership is emphasized throughout\r\nthe Tokyo Declaration, including in the last sentence of the\r\npreamble, which states,\r\n\"We, therefore, solemnly adopt the present Declaration,\r\nin the firm belief that it will serve to strengthen an\r\nemerging new partnership for sustainable development\r\nof Africa based on self-reliance of African countries\r\nand the support of Africa’s development partners.\"\r\nSecondly, I should like to comment on the new\r\ndimension the Conference gave the subject of African\r\ndevelopment by discussing it in conjunction with Asian\r\nexperience. Under this agenda item, case studies of\r\nIndonesia and Thailand were presented by two prominent\r\nguest speakers from those countries, and opinions and\r\nanalyses were offered by other participants. Although it was\r\nnoted at the Conference that no model of development can\r\nsimply be transferred from one region to another, it was\r\nacknowledged that some of the Asian experience is relevant\r\nto African development, such as the value of appropriate\r\nlong-term development strategies, a functional government\r\nadministration and the strong commitment of both a\r\ncountry’s leadership and its people to the achievement of\r\neconomic prosperity. Opportunities for South-South\r\ncooperation between Asia and Africa are growing, and I\r\nshould like to note that many countries participating in the\r\nConference showed an interest in exploring this area.\r\nMr. Martini Herrera (Guatemala), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nLastly, I should like to refer to the Japanese\r\nGovernment’s statements delivered at the Conference by\r\nPrime Minister Hosokawa and Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nForeign Minister Hata, which may be summarized as\r\nfollows:\r\nFirst, Japan will endeavour to contribute to enhancing\r\npolitical processes in Africa, extending assistance to\r\ndemocratization efforts, both bilaterally and through\r\nparticipation in the international efforts undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations and other organizations.\r\nSecondly, Japan will continue actively to assist\r\neconomic reform in Africa. It will, for example, extend\r\nnon-project-type grant assistance totaling $650 million to\r\n$700 million over the three Japanese fiscal years from 1993\r\nto 1995, mainly to those African countries that are pursuing\r\nsuch reform programmes. We also strongly urge\r\ncontinuation of the Special Programme of Assistance for\r\nAfrica (SPA) and a new facility to succeed the present\r\nEnhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).\r\nThirdly, Japan will actively assist in human-resources\r\ndevelopment. We are starting an African Youth Invitation\r\nProgramme so that young individuals may come from Africa\r\nto Japan, and we are attempting to hold an Asia-Africa\r\nseminar next year, in cooperation with other interested\r\ncountries and organizations.\r\nFourthly, Japan will pay further attention to\r\nenvironmental problems in Africa, in line with its earlier\r\ncommitment to expand substantially its global\r\nenvironment-related official development assistance to\r\nbetween $7 billion and $7.7 billion over the next five years.\r\nIt has also formulated a project to develop underground\r\nwater resources and water supplies in various parts of\r\nsub-Saharan Africa and will provide grant aid of\r\n$250 million to $300 million for this purpose over the next\r\nthree years.\r\nFinally, Japan’s official development assistance will\r\nemphasize effectiveness and efficiency and take into account\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\neach country’s stage of economic development, in\r\naccordance with the principles set forth last year in Japan’s\r\nofficial-development-assistance charter. To this end, we\r\nintend to strengthen policy dialogue with African countries\r\nand send more frequent economic cooperation missions to\r\nthe region.\r\nIn order to help African countries achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment, it is necessary to take a comprehensive\r\napproach that addresses issues including trade, investment,\r\ndebt, environment, and population. The United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s sets\r\nforth the principles that must guide us in formulating such\r\nan approach. I believe that the Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development made a major\r\ncontribution to the successful implementation of the New\r\nAgenda, and the Japanese Government will cooperate fully\r\nwith other countries and organizations, especially the United\r\nNations and the Global Coalition for Africa, in undertaking\r\nfollow-up activities.\r\nMy delegation would like to conclude its statement by\r\nexpressing Japan’s firm commitment to continuing and\r\nstrengthening its partnership with African countries as they\r\nstrive to achieve sustainable development and, by so doing,\r\nenter a new era of prosperity and security.\r\nMr. NOTERDAEME (Belgium) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the honour of speaking on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Community and its member States.\r\nI wish first of all to thank the Secretary-General for the\r\nvarious reports which he has submitted to the General\r\nAssembly and which form the basis for our debate today.\r\nWe see in this confirmation of the Secretary-General’s\r\npersonal interest in Africa’s economic problems.\r\nWe would also like to thank the Special Coordinator for\r\nAfrica, Mr. Ould Abdallah, for his contribution to our work.\r\nYear after year we are presented with the picture of an\r\nAfrica in crisis. Over the past 10 years we have seen\r\nspectacular growth in a whole group of developing countries\r\nin other parts of the world. For Africa, on the other hand,\r\nthe talk is of a lost decade. We must not give way to\r\nfatalism, however, but must look for the true causes of the\r\nproblems. The recent Tokyo Conference enabled us to make\r\nprogress in that quest.\r\nBut we should not generalize too much. There have, it\r\nis true, been some positive events on the continent. Since\r\nthe end of the 1980s we have seen in Africa a tremendous\r\nmovement of social, political and economic reform which\r\ncan lay the foundations for societies that are more open and\r\nmore capable of managing their own destinies. We must\r\npay a tribute to the African peoples and politicians that have\r\ncourageously embarked upon the path of democracy.\r\nHowever, despite a better international political context\r\nand substantial international assistance, the African\r\neconomies have not got off the mark. We must try to find\r\nthe reasons for that failure. When we bring the question\r\ndown to its more concrete dimensions, we can see a number\r\nof direct causes.\r\nFirst, in Africa the very concept of development has\r\nbeen for too long a notion imposed from above, unconnected\r\nwith the actual potential of these societies. Their lack of\r\ncommitment explains the abandonment of the agricultural\r\nsector, the low level of savings, the flight of capital and the\r\nbrain drain.\r\nSecondly, the demographic factor has always prevented\r\nany improvement in living standards. At whatever cost, this\r\nspiral in which all economic growth is nullified by\r\npopulation growth must be halted.\r\nThirdly, Africa is perhaps the continent where the\r\nhuman potential for development has been the most\r\nunderestimated. There has been a tragic waste of life and of\r\na spirit of initiative. Donor countries and African countries\r\nhave often taken the wrong road together by promoting\r\ndevelopment based on major infrastructures rather than\r\ntaking as their point of departure the fundamental elements -\r\neducation, health, the vital role of women and the\r\nencouragement of the societies’ human potential.\r\nAt the same time, we must concede that the world\r\neconomic situation has not been favourable to the recovery\r\nof African economies. This remark applies to the level of\r\ncommodity prices, international interest rates and the\r\nmovement of private investment. We have no decisive\r\ncontrol over all these factors, but we are still aware of the\r\nneed to create a better international economic climate to\r\naccompany the efforts of the African countries, particularly\r\nin respect of the liberalization of trade and access to\r\nmarkets.\r\nIt is with this in mind that we should evaluate the\r\nchances of success for the New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa. In many respects the Agenda is an ambitious\r\ndocument. This applies in particular to the figures for\r\neconomic growth and transfers of resources. The experience\r\nof previous programmes, in particular the United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery and\r\nDevelopment 1986-1990, has taught us that operational\r\nfollow-up is as important as the selection of targets.\r\nInternational assistance, if it is to contribute effectively\r\nto growth, must be accompanied by an effort to improve\r\n49th meeting - Thursday, 4 November 1993 15\r\npublic financing. Only in that way will the international\r\nfinancial community and private investors find their way\r\nback to Africa. However, the international community has\r\nnot abandoned Africa to its fate. Indeed, both in absolute\r\nand in per capita terms, more international aid went to\r\nAfrica during the 1980s than to other continents.\r\nAs to the European Community and its member States,\r\nI wish to reaffirm here our traditional links of solidarity with\r\nAfrica. We cannot agree that indifference towards Africa\r\nprevails. Indeed, Africa remains the largest beneficiary of\r\nthe aid which the Community and its member States extend\r\nthrough the Lomé Conventions. A fund of about\r\n100 million ECUs was set up by the Community last May.\r\nIn addition to this Community aid there has been substantial\r\nbilateral assistance from individual member States of the\r\nCommunity. Thanks to these actions at various levels, the\r\nCommunity and its member States are the primary donors to\r\nand the primary trading partners of the African continent.\r\nAmong the specific problems facing African countries\r\nwe would like to highlight two in particular: debt and\r\ndiversification.\r\nAs to external debt, we recognize the urgency of taking\r\nappropriate steps within the framework of the international\r\nstrategy, while placing debt-servicing within the broader\r\ncontext of capital flows. The member States of the\r\nCommunity have continued, in the Paris Club, to take\r\nmeasures to help the poorest countries which are so deeply\r\nin debt, and we urge the other creditors to do so.\r\nThe Community and its member States are also\r\ncognizant of the problem of the indebtedness of certain\r\nAfrican countries with income at the intermediate echelon of\r\nthe lower level. They hope that these can be given, on a\r\ncase-by-case basis, more favourable treatment, particularly\r\nby the Paris Club. However, we stress that the debt\r\nproblems cannot be solved solely by international action.\r\nThe countries themselves bear the responsibility for adopting\r\nsound policies within the framework of structural adjustment.\r\nEconomic diversification is a priority, since the\r\nvulnerability of African economies is often a direct\r\nconsequence of the lack of diversity. This applies\r\nparticularly to countries which are heavily dependent upon\r\ncommodity exports. These exports must find outlets but, at\r\nthe same time, an economic environment more favourable to\r\ndiversification must be created. While we recognize this\r\nproblem, we must see it in the broader framework of the\r\npromotion of alternative investments and the stabilization of\r\nexport earnings. Above all, we must avoid the unrealistic\r\napproaches of the past. The possibilities that exist in the\r\nmultilateral system to promote diversification should be\r\nexploited to the utmost, avoiding the creation of new\r\nstructures which would result in duplication.\r\nWe are speaking here of Africa as a whole, but we\r\nshould not overlook the fact that this vast continent does not\r\nlend itself to stereotypes. Our efforts must be sufficiently\r\nflexible for regional and even subregional differences to be\r\ntaken into account. The possibilities of regional and\r\nsubregional cooperation in Africa are not being sufficiently\r\nexploited. In the implementation of the New Agenda a\r\nrevitalized economic commission for Africa could play a\r\nprimary role. We urge the establishment of an African\r\neconomic community in accordance with the Abuja Treaty,\r\nand we will most willingly share with our African partners\r\nthe experience accumulated in the course of the process of\r\neconomic integration within the European Community.\r\nSubregional cooperation is irreplaceable in a number of\r\neconomic sectors. Indeed, the concept of sustainable\r\ndevelopment has directed attention to problems which, by\r\ntheir very nature, transcend borders and require common\r\napproaches. Drought and desertification, the focus of the\r\nRio follow-up debate, are merely the most striking examples.\r\nWe reaffirm the importance to be given Africa in drawing\r\nup an international convention on the subject.\r\nAfrican development cannot be isolated from the ups\r\nand downs of the world economy. However, if we can\r\nsucceed in creating healthy and efficient national economies\r\nin the African countries they will find a way of integrating\r\nthemselves into the global economy.\r\nThe European Community and its member States\r\nwholeheartedly subscribe to the notion of shared\r\nresponsibility and partnership, as defined by the eighth\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We\r\nare convinced that the cycle of poverty can be broken and\r\nthat, thanks to national and international efforts, Africa will\r\ncome to take its proper place in our world.\r\nMr. KARUKUBIRO KAMUNANWIRE (Uganda): I\r\nshould like at the outset to express my delegation’s sincere\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the excellent\r\nreports he has presented on this agenda item, including that\r\non the need for and feasibility of the establishment of a\r\ndiversification fund for Africa’s commodities and that on\r\nfinancial and resource flows to Africa, specifically requested\r\nin the context of the implementation of the New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. These two areas\r\nare deemed critical and necessary for the successful\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda. We are grateful for the\r\nconcrete proposals contained in the two reports.\r\nThe African countries cannot for ever continue to rely\r\non one or two export commodities for their export earnings.\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThere is a need for them to strive to diversify their primary\r\ncommodities and to add value through increased processing.\r\nOnly in that way can they expect to achieve stability and an\r\nincrease in their export earnings.\r\nWe support the suggestion in document A/48/335 that\r\na diversification fund be established within the framework of\r\nthe African Development Bank. The main purpose of that\r\nfund, it has been made very clear, is to assist in the\r\npreparation of commodity diversification projects. To do\r\nthat, the report recommends the formation in Africa of\r\nnational diversification councils, which would draw up such\r\ndiversification projects in close cooperation with the fund.\r\nThis arrangement should make it possible to address\r\nanomalies that might arise in project preparations. This is an\r\ninitiative that should be viewed as giving new impetus to the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s.\r\nWe should also support the suggestion that the fund be\r\nestablished on the basis of voluntary contributions and that\r\nit make grant allocations for pre-investment activities. To\r\nensure financing for such a fund the international community\r\nand multilateral financing institutions must make generous\r\ncontributions to meet the targets set for its establishment.\r\nThe question of adequate financial and resource flows\r\nis particularly crucial at this stage of the political and\r\neconomic transformation in which many of the countries of\r\nAfrica are now seriously engaged.\r\nOur developed partners quite often suggest domestic\r\nsavings as a source of needed financial resources. It should,\r\nhowever, be noted that only improved terms of trade could\r\nenhance Africa’s capacity for domestic savings. As has been\r\nindicated, a quick look at the ridiculous prices African\r\ncommodities have been fetching in the international markets\r\nover the years shows us why this has not been possible.\r\nCoffee prices, for example, have fallen from a high of over\r\n$3 in 1978 to as low as 40 cents, or even less, in 1992.\r\nThus countries like Uganda, which in 1978 earned more than\r\n$400 million in coffee exports alone, are now earning less\r\nthan $100 million for export volumes that have more than\r\ndoubled. The same story can be told of cocoa, tea, timber\r\nand a number of Africa’s other agricultural and mineral\r\nproducts.\r\nThe point must therefore be made that for most African\r\ncountries the ability to achieve savings is dependent upon the\r\nperformance of their export sector. The drop in prices of\r\nmajor primary commodities results in loss of revenue,\r\nleading to a serious decline in income as the taxable base is\r\neroded.\r\nIn the absence of such capacity to save, external support\r\nis imperative. Our demand, therefore, should be to obtain\r\nfair remuneration for our commodities and unimpeded access\r\nto outside markets for our products.\r\nThere is a need now, more than ever before, to put\r\ngreater emphasis on commercial loans to countries of the\r\nregion than on the continued resort to existing forms of\r\nexternal financing. This is because most of the resources\r\nbeing made available through official development assistance\r\nhave tended to be inadequate; they do not cater for long-\r\nterm transformation. Africa needs resources that are large\r\nenough and can be used to address the inadequate physical,\r\ninstitutional and social infrastructures and the problems of a\r\nweak productive base. Long-term lending should be possible\r\nfor those countries that are embarking on fundamental\r\neconomic restructuring and that can demonstrate returns on\r\ninvestment. That is possible if the projects financed are\r\nviable.\r\nThe change in the form, mode and volume of external\r\nfinancing is important, because there is little to show for all\r\nthe official development assistance that has been allocated to\r\nthe continent over the years. The reasons for this are not far\r\nto seek. The bulk of the bilateral and multilateral aid flow\r\nto Africa so far has gone to finance technical assistance and\r\nimport support, and very little, if any, has gone to productive\r\ncapital. That is why there is now a need to focus on\r\nphysical, institutional and social infrastructures.\r\nIn many cases the failure of development projects is\r\nerroneously thought to be associated with the domestic\r\npolicies of the recipient Governments. What is often\r\noverlooked, however, is that many of the development plans\r\nand their failed projects, which are often blamed on the\r\npolicies of the recipient developing countries, were in fact\r\ndesigned, put in place and executed on the advice and with\r\nthe close involvement of the donor countries and multilateral\r\nfinancing institutions.\r\nA closer study of the background of these plans and\r\nprojects would reveal that, for most of them, the consultants,\r\ncontractors or those charged with implementing them were\r\nselected and approved by the donors and financing\r\ninstitutions themselves. Because of low capacity in project\r\ndesign and execution in many African countries, our\r\ncountries had little alternative but to rely on them for advice.\r\nRegrettably, many of these projects turned out to be too\r\nill-designed or poorly executed to achieve the desired results.\r\nThis was due to the fact that outside advisers and support\r\npersonnel failed to appreciate the local conditions in\r\nrecipient countries and the effect of those conditions on\r\nprojects. And yet their accountability in this regard has\r\nnever been brought to the fore - so far.\r\n49th meeting - Thursday, 4 November 1993 17\r\nThe atmosphere prevailing in international relations\r\nappears to be more propitious now than ever before. Many\r\nAfrican countries have taken the necessary hard decisions\r\nand have put in place policies and programmes for\r\nadjustment, sustainable development and transformation.\r\nGovernance and accountability, for example, have become\r\naccepted practice without undue external pressure. The time,\r\ntherefore, has now come to show what money is being spent,\r\nwhere, for what purpose and to whose benefit, and to show\r\nthe effectiveness of these expenditures in terms of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s.\r\nAny strategy for financial flows to Africa that does not\r\naddress the debt problem will be self-defeating. The present\r\nmechanism and format for handling the problem need to be\r\nsubstantially reviewed in order to provide both short- and\r\nlong-term relief to the beneficiaries. We must continue to\r\npress for cancellation for severely indebted low-income\r\ncountries. The essential elements of any initiative should\r\ninclude cancellation or a substantial reduction in the debt\r\nstock.\r\nDebt owed to multilateral creditors should not for ever\r\nremain sacrosanct and thus exempt from the kind of flexible\r\ntreatment being offered through various menus of options,\r\nsuch as cancellation, reduction, rescheduling, conversion, and\r\nso forth. By their actions, the multilateral financial\r\ninstitutions, rather than subtracting from the debt burden of\r\nincapacitated indebted low-income countries, are adding to\r\nit. Scarce concessional resources are now being used to\r\nservice these debts instead of applying them to development\r\npurposes. The net effect of this is simply to convert a\r\npayment crisis into a chronic problem the end of which does\r\nnot seem to be in sight.\r\nThe multilateral financial institutions are urged to\r\nconsider canceling, reducing or rescheduling the debts owed\r\nthem by the severely indebted countries of Africa, in order\r\nto provide much-needed relief at this time of their socio-\r\neconomic transformation. Furthermore, the commitment by\r\nthe international community in the context of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s to give full and tangible support to the African effort\r\nhas yet to materialize. During the United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery and\r\nDevelopment 1986-1990, the international community\r\ncommitted itself to assisting Africa to engineer the process\r\nof recovery during the period 1986 to 1990. The\r\ninternational community was expected to transfer $9 billion\r\nannually for that purpose, over and above official\r\ndevelopment assistance. It is a sad commentary that very\r\nlittle ever happened during that period. Thirty billion dollars\r\nin net official development assistance was set for 1992 for\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s, and it was agreed that subsequent\r\nofficial development assistance would grow in real terms at\r\nthe rate of 4 per cent annually. We have yet to see the\r\ncommitment of the international community materialize in\r\nthis regard.\r\nThe point must be made that Africa needs special\r\ntemporary measures. African countries are not in a position\r\nto compete effectively in the financial markets of a world\r\nthat has become more competitive. The weakness of the\r\nindustrial base and social and political problems have made\r\nAfrica less competitive. The support of the international\r\ncommunity is therefore critical in this regard.\r\nLet me conclude by taking this opportunity to thank,\r\nmost sincerely, the Government of Japan for the recent\r\nimportant and significant initiative which it undertook in\r\nconvening the successful Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development. The Global Coalition for Africa and\r\nthe office of the United Nations Coordinator for Africa and\r\nthe least-developed countries are also to be commended for\r\ntheir support and their efforts in organizing that Conference.\r\nThe Conference succeeded in focusing international attention\r\non Africa. The African participants reiterated their\r\ncommitment to self-help and regional integration, and\r\nexpressed the hope that the international community would,\r\nin turn, focus its attention on support for African endeavors.\r\nAs with most conferences of this nature, the most important\r\nelement remains that of follow-up action to make good on\r\nthe commitments that were entered into. It is our earnest\r\nhope that all concerned will come to live by these\r\ncommitments.\r\nMr. SAMASSEKOU (Mali) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): My delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his pertinent reports on the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and for\r\nthe various actions he has undertaken towards confronting\r\nthe problems of the continent and making the international\r\ncommunity more aware of the need to help solve them.\r\nBefore commenting on the item before the Assembly,\r\nmy delegation wants to state that it fully endorses the views\r\nexpressed by the representatives of Egypt and Algeria, who\r\nspoke on behalf of the current President of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) and the current Chairman of the\r\nAfrican Group at the United Nations. We also thank the\r\nrepresentative of Colombia, current Chairman of the Group\r\nof 77, for the Group’s support in the search for a solution to\r\nAfrica’s concerns.\r\nThe General Assembly’s adoption in 1991 of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s raised great hopes both among the Governments and\r\nthe peoples of Africa.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nBased on the principle of shared responsibility and real\r\npartnership between Africa and the international community,\r\nthe New Agenda differs from the United Nations Programme\r\nof Action for African Economic Recovery and Development\r\n1986-1990 in that it hinges on precisely defined objectives\r\nto be attained during the 1990s. These include, among\r\nothers, an average annual growth rate of gross domestic\r\nproduct in Africa of at least 6 per cent, and a minimum of\r\n$30 billion in net official development assistance in 1992, a\r\nsum that is to grow at an average rate of 4 per cent per\r\nannum.\r\nIn addition to these goals, the New Agenda clearly\r\ndefines the respective responsibilities of Africa, the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations system. In\r\nthat respect, it asks the African countries to implement the\r\neconomic reforms necessary for sustainable growth and\r\ndevelopment; it asks the international community to seek a\r\nsolution to the debt problem, supply additional resources and\r\nsupport efforts towards diversification and economic\r\nintegration; and it asks the United Nations system to play a\r\nmajor role in carrying out specific programmes compatible\r\nwith the goals of the New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica.\r\nDespite the specific nature of the New Agenda’s goals,\r\nthe level of achievement remains below the minimum\r\nexpected by Africa. Prospects for an economic rebound in\r\nAfrica seem less and less promising, due to the excessive\r\nburden of external debt, the fall in commodity prices and the\r\ndecline of financial flows. During the New Agenda’s\r\nimplementation period, African growth rates have so far\r\nranged from 1 per cent to 3.8 per cent, depending on the\r\nsubregion. The various rates remain well below the goal of\r\n6 per cent set by the New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica. As to resource flows, generally speaking the amount\r\nof financial assistance given to Africa has declined. The\r\navailable funds are below the annual volume foreseen within\r\nthe New Agenda. In connection with commodities, the\r\nSecretary-General notes in document A/48/334 that exports\r\nfrom sub-Saharan Africa have fallen by 15 per cent in the\r\n1990s and that the value of these exports is barely higher\r\nthan it was in 1990.\r\nWithin the framework of the burning question of\r\ncommodities, my delegation believes that special attention\r\nshould be given to the conclusions and recommendations in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General (A/48/335) entitled \"Need\r\nfor and feasibility of the establishment of a diversification\r\nfund for Africa’s commodities\". My delegation welcomes\r\nthe recommendation to establish a diversification fund for\r\nAfrica’s commodities and national diversification councils.\r\nWhile urging African countries to establish these councils as\r\nquickly as possible, we urgently appeal to the international\r\ncommunity that it implement the recommendation that the\r\nnecessary resources be made available for this fund. It is\r\ndesirable for the fund to become operational by\r\nDecember 1993.\r\nWithin the framework of international solidarity and the\r\nties of cooperation that link Africa to the rest of the world,\r\nparticular attention should be given to this continent because\r\nof the specificity and gravity of its problems. Indeed, Africa\r\nin its development efforts remains the most handicapped of\r\nany region. It still has the lowest standard of living in the\r\nworld, and extreme poverty continues to grow there. Africa\r\ndevotes a third of its export earnings to servicing a debt that\r\nis the heaviest per capita in the world and the total volume\r\nof which amounted to $225 billion in 1992. Currently, its\r\nshare in international trade is tiny, amounting to less than\r\n2 per cent of world merchandise exchange.\r\nThe many programmes and plans for Africa drawn up\r\non the national, subregional, regional and international levels\r\nshould be tangibly put into practice. The New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa makes it possible to gauge\r\nprogress made towards African development in each of the\r\nareas I have addressed.\r\nThat is why my delegation appeals to all the members\r\nof the international community effectively to implement the\r\ncommitments they have undertaken in order to realize the\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa. I take this\r\nopportunity to extend my delegation’s congratulations and\r\nthanks to the Japanese Government, which has recently\r\nhosted an International Conference on African Development.\r\nThe effective implementation of the Declaration made at that\r\nConference deserves the special attention of all participants.\r\nMore than ever, the African countries need the\r\ncooperation of the rest of the international community. It is\r\nvital that we initiate a process of true partnership. We\r\nbelieve that Africa, like other regions of the world, is ready\r\nto receive investments. It would be useful to establish\r\nrelations of mutual trust with investors. In that regard, we\r\nare aware that a share of responsibility falls on the recipient\r\ncountries. In most of our countries, the conditions for\r\nguaranteeing investments have been met. Considerable\r\nefforts have been exerted towards that end. But we also ask\r\nthe source countries for these potential investments to take\r\nmeasures to encourage investment and to guarantee them\r\nwith commitments to the recipient countries if need be.\r\nWith the implementation in several countries of bold\r\nprogrammes of economic reform and structural adjustment,\r\nalong with the establishment of democracy, Africa has\r\nreached a decisive stage in its history. The international\r\ncommunity will have to help pursue the process under way.\r\n49th meeting - Thursday, 4 November 1993 19\r\nMr. BILOA TANG (Cameroon) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Beyond what the representatives of Algeria, Egypt\r\nand Colombia have already said on behalf of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the Group of 77, I should\r\nlike at the outset to express our appreciation and gratitude to\r\nthe Secretary-General for the steps he has taken to\r\nimplement the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. These steps include in\r\nparticular the establishment of a Panel of High-level\r\nPersonalities on the development of Africa and the naming\r\nof a Special Coordinator for Africa and the Least Developed\r\nCountries.\r\nI should also like to express our satisfaction with the\r\nSecretary-General’s reports on the implementation of the\r\nNew Agenda, the study on the feasibility of establishing a\r\ndiversification fund for African commodities, and resource\r\nflows for African development.\r\nIn the 1960s, following accession to independence by\r\nAfrican countries, voices were raised against the French\r\nagronomist René Dumont, who had dared to write in a\r\nhenceforth notorious work that Black Africa had started off\r\non the wrong foot.\r\nThree decades later, Africa still gives the impression not\r\nonly of having started out on the wrong track but of not\r\nhaving started at all, as a result of the succession and\r\nconcatenation of unfortunate events that have made it\r\nimpossible for it to achieve economic lift-off. This is what\r\nMr. Ferdinand Leopold Oyono, Minister of Foreign\r\nRelations and Head of the Cameroonian delegation, had in\r\nmind in his statement on 8 October last to the Assembly\r\nwhen he described the situation as follows:\r\n\"A victim of flagrant injustices that constitute\r\ngrave violations of human dignity, Africa, more than\r\nany other developing region, has the characteristics of\r\na continent adrift. It is toiling under an intolerable\r\nburden of debt in a situation exacerbated by an overall\r\ntrend towards disinvestment, a decline in official\r\ndevelopment assistance and a steady deterioration in the\r\nterms of trade as a result of the continuing fall in\r\ncommodity prices.\" (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-eighth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n22nd meeting, p. 9)\r\nAs if that were not enough, environmental degradation,\r\nnatural disasters, endemic diseases, famine, illiteracy and\r\ngalloping population growth have made Africa a continent\r\nwhere life is not pleasant. Faced with this situation, which\r\nis neither more nor less than disastrous, in June 1986 the\r\ninternational community decided to seek ways and means of\r\nsaving Africa, through the United Nations Programme of\r\nAction for African Economic Recovery and Development\r\n1986-1990.\r\nCourageous and even bold measures were recommended\r\nand adopted, but, as ever where Africa is concerned, there\r\nwas agreement on the diagnosis and the therapy but there\r\nwas no follow-up action. So, as far as Africa’s critical\r\neconomic situation is concerned, one can understand why\r\none hears talk of a lost decade.\r\nAfrica and the international community, faced with this\r\nfailure - and in an unprecedented upsurge of\r\nsolidarity - once again adopted what was described as a\r\nworld partnership for African development. Firm and\r\nspecific commitments were made by both sides.\r\nAfrica undertook far-reaching and difficult reforms\r\ndesigned to speed up the process of democratization,\r\npromote human rights and ensure economic, social and\r\ncultural development in an atmosphere of transparency and\r\nwith the active participation of all positive forces - and,\r\nwhile so doing, stressing the creation of attractive conditions\r\nfor investment, developing the potential of our human\r\nresources, applying structural adjustment programmes and\r\npursuing and consolidating economic integration through\r\nsubregional, regional and international cooperation.\r\nFor its part, the international community undertook to\r\nsupport these efforts, specifically by seeking a lasting\r\nsolution to the debt problem, providing substantial additional\r\nfinancial resources and supporting economic diversification,\r\nto name but a few. However, while Africa has been\r\nresolutely striving to honour its commitments under the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s, at the cost of enormous sacrifices, the\r\ninternational community’s enthusiasm, on the other hand,\r\nappears to have waned. This is why we are afraid that we\r\nwill see the New Agenda suffer the same sad fate that befell\r\nthe Programme of Action.\r\nMy delegation therefore joins all those others that have\r\nalready stressed the urgent need for there to be an effective\r\nand rapid implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nWith this in mind, my delegation also attaches great\r\nimportance to the role of the Bureau of the Special\r\nCoordinator, and would wish for suitable steps to be taken\r\nto strengthen its ability to intervene. In the same vein, we\r\nwelcome and support the proposal to establish a\r\ndiversification fund for Africa’s products under the auspices\r\nand with the support of the African Development Bank.\r\nCameroon, which already possesses diversification\r\nstructures, notes with keen interest the proposal to establish\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nnational diversification committees, as spelt out in the report\r\nof the Secretary-General.\r\nWhether the issue is one of establishing these new\r\nstructures or of economic recovery, Africa needs new,\r\nadditional financial resources: Africa is cruelly short of\r\nthem. Of course Africa needs a diversification fund; but it\r\nalso, and most of all, needs funds to finance its development\r\nin general. In this connection, suffice it to mention my\r\ndelegation’s assessment of the Tokyo Conference.\r\nWe note that substantial spontaneous and generous\r\nefforts have been undertaken to the benefit of the so-called\r\n\"countries in transition\", and, even more recently, to the\r\nbenefit of recovery and reconstruction in the Middle East.\r\nCould not Africa too, for its development, be a beneficiary\r\nof the same spontaneity and generosity, which, in the final\r\nanalysis, are the tangible expression of real political will?\r\nIt is this political will we call for.\r\nMr. OUEDRAOGO (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Most of the speakers before me this morning\r\nhave put forward essentially the same points of view held by\r\nthe delegation of Burkina Faso. I shall therefore confine\r\nmyself to making just a few comments.\r\nIn speaking today on the item on the agenda, we are\r\nbitterly reminded of the failure of the United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery and\r\nDevelopment. As the representative of Burkina Faso said\r\nduring the general debate at the forty-seventh session,\r\n\"The rewards of the tireless efforts of the African\r\ncountries have not been commensurate with the\r\nsacrifices we have made. The promises of the North\r\nremain promises, just as the United Nations Programme\r\nof Action for African Economic Recovery and\r\nDevelopment has not been truly implemented, except by\r\nAfricans themselves. A new page has been turned with\r\nthe new programme for the 1990s, but that page\r\nremains blank.\" (A/47/PV.21, p. 88)\r\nEven today, two years after the adoption of the New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa, we cannot fail to note that\r\nlittle progress has been made in implementing it.\r\nWhile we can welcome the establishment of the Panel\r\nof High- level Personalities on African Development and the\r\nfact that it has held two meetings under the chairmanship of\r\nthe Secretary-General of our Organization, we can also\r\nwonder what the content and the results of those meetings\r\nhave been. Indeed, it seems that the only information about\r\nthe meetings that we have had made available so far has\r\nbeen in the press releases covering the Secretary-General’s\r\nstatements about them.\r\nOn the institutional level, the New Agenda falls within\r\nthe province of the Bureau of the Special Coordinator for\r\nAfrica and the Least Developed Countries; the resources and\r\nthe capability of the Bureau should, in our view, be\r\nstrengthened.\r\nHowever, we do have some grounds for satisfaction and\r\nencouragement following the issuance of report A/48/335 on\r\nthe need for and feasibility of the establishment of a\r\ndiversification fund for Africa’s commodities. In the report,\r\nthe Secretary-General puts forward valuable arguments in\r\nfavour of diversification, together with specific and balanced\r\nproposals.\r\nA diversification fund for Africa’s commodities is an\r\nurgent, imperative necessity, because one of Africa’s major\r\neconomic difficulties is the fact that it is dependent on a few\r\nexport products that are constantly declining in price. My\r\ndelegation therefore supports the establishment of a\r\ndiversification fund. We hope that all the parties concerned\r\nand interested in African development will also support it.\r\nAlongside the establishment of the fund, other\r\naccompanying measures will have to follow. Thus,\r\ndiversification should cover products that will find a market\r\nin Africa and internationally; African products ought to have\r\nbetter access to the world market - and here we believe that\r\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations\r\nmust be concluded with the interests of all the categories of\r\ndeveloping countries taken into account equally - and there\r\nmust also be a price stabilization system for our export\r\nproducts. If these points are not taken into account in the\r\ndiversification process, the efforts made towards that end are\r\nlikely to be insignificant and unfruitful.\r\n49th meeting - Thursday, 4 November 1993 21\r\nThe success of the New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa depends also on other key areas; these are\r\nindustrialization, transport and communications and the\r\nsettlement of the foreign debt question. The resolutions on\r\nthe Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa and\r\nthe Second Transport and Communications Decade in Africa\r\nmust therefore be put rapidly into effect. It is also a matter\r\nof urgency for us to see results from the promise that an\r\ninternational conference on foreign debt can be held, as\r\nprovided for in paragraph 28 of the New Agenda for African\r\nDevelopment in the 1990s.\r\nIn conclusion, and so that what I have just said should\r\nbe something more than a simple wish list, we should like\r\nhere to express our conviction that the success of the New\r\nAgenda for Africa cannot be ensured unless it is followed up\r\nwith specific actions. The provisions of the agreement are\r\nprecise and clear, and all that is needed is for each of the\r\nparties to put them into full effect. Africa, for its part, is\r\nalready working on them.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment at its eighth session and the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development have\r\nproclaimed a new era of cooperation and partnership. The\r\nsuccess or failure of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nAfrican Development in the 1990s will show whether we are\r\ncapable of honouring our solemn commitments. Also, we\r\nbelieve that, in this regard, our word is our bond. Our work\r\nlies before us, and it is our actions that will speak.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
