The terms of office of the following\r\nJudges expire the previous day: Mr. Shigeru Oda,\r\nMr. Ni Zhengyu, Mr. Jens Evensen, Mr. Bola Ajibola and\r\nMr. Géza Herczegh.\r\nIn connection with the election, I should like to bring\r\nthe following matters to the attention of the members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFirst, in accordance with General Assembly resolution\r\n264 (III), a State which is a party to the Statute of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice but not a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations shall participate in the General Assembly in\r\nelecting the members of the Court in the same manner as the\r\nStates Members of the United Nations. Therefore, on this\r\noccasion the representatives of Nauru and Switzerland may\r\nparticipate in the election.\r\nSecondly, I should like to confirm that at this time the\r\nSecurity Council, independently of the General Assembly, is\r\nalso proceeding to elect five members of the Court. This\r\nprocedure is in accordance with Article 8 of the Statute of\r\nthe Court, which provides that\r\n\"The General Assembly and the Security Council\r\nshall proceed independently of one another to elect the\r\nmembers of the Court.\"\r\nAccordingly, the results of the voting in the General\r\nAssembly will not be communicated to the Security Council\r\nuntil five candidates have obtained the required majority in\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nFinally, I should like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to the documents relating to the election. The list\r\nof candidates which have been nominated by national groups\r\nis to be found in document A/48/433/Rev.l-S/26490/Rev.1.\r\nThe curricula vitae of the candidates are to be found in\r\ndocument A/48/440-S/26497 and Corr.l. The Assembly also\r\nhas before it document A/48/432-S/26489 containing a\r\nmemorandum by the Secretary-General on the present\r\ncomposition of the Court and the procedure to be followed\r\nin the Assembly and in the Security Council with regard to\r\nthe election.\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-87117 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.51\r\n12 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the\r\nStatute of the Court, those candidates who obtain an absolute\r\nmajority of votes both in the General Assembly and in the\r\nSecurity Council shall be considered as elected.\r\nThe consistent practice of the United Nations has been\r\nto interpret the words \"absolute majority\" as meaning a\r\nmajority of all electors whether or not they vote or are\r\nallowed to vote. The electors in the General Assembly are\r\nall 184 Member States together with the two non-member\r\nStates which are parties to the Statute of the Court, namely\r\nNauru and Switzerland, for a total of 186 electors.\r\nAccordingly, for the present election, 94 votes constitute an\r\nabsolute majority in the General Assembly.\r\nThe General Assembly will now proceed to a secret\r\nballot. If on the first ballot fewer than five candidates obtain\r\nan absolute majority it will be necessary to proceed to other\r\nballots until five candidates have obtained that majority.\r\nPursuant to the decision taken by the General Assembly at\r\nits 915th meeting, on 16 November 1960, these ballots shall\r\nbe unrestricted.\r\nI should like to remind representatives that, pursuant to\r\nrule 88 of the rules of procedure:\r\n\"After the President has announced the beginning of\r\nvoting, no representative shall interrupt the voting\r\nexcept on a point of order in connection with the actual\r\nconduct of the voting.\"\r\nTherefore, any announcements such as those concerning\r\nwithdrawals of candidatures should be made prior to the\r\ncommencement of the voting process, that is to say, the\r\ndistribution of the ballot papers.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly agrees to the\r\nprocedures I have just outlined? I see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Ballot papers will now be\r\ndistributed and I ask members to take their seats to allow for\r\ntheir smooth distribution.\r\nThe voting process has now begun.\r\nRepresentatives are requested to use only the ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed. Only those candidates\r\nwhose names appear on the ballot papers are eligible.\r\nRepresentatives will indicate the five - I repeat, five -\r\ncandidates for whom they wish to vote by placing crosses at\r\nthe left of their names on the ballot papers. Ballot papers on\r\nwhich more than five names are marked will be considered\r\ninvalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names\r\nappear on the ballot papers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Yahya (Brunei\r\nDarussalam), Mrs. Valle Camino (Cuba), Ms. Lehto\r\n(Finland), Mr. Suziedelis (Lithuania) and Ms. Iiyambo\r\n(Namibia) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10:55 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 12:20 p.m.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 179\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 179\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 178\r\nRequired majority: 94\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Shigeru Oda (Japan) 163\r\nMr. Carl-August Fleischhauer (Germany) 152\r\nMr. Jiuyong Shi (China) 147\r\nMr. Géza Herczegh (Hungary) 76\r\nMr. José Luis Jesus (Cape Verde) 72\r\nMr. Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra Leone) 68\r\nMr. Samuel K. B. Asante (Ghana) 39\r\nMr. Alexander Yankov (Bulgaria) 33\r\nMr. Krzysztof Skubiszewski (Poland) 32\r\nMr. Rodger M. A. Chongwe (Zambia) 24\r\nMr. Volodymyr A. Vassylenko (Ukraine) 22\r\nMr. Andronico O. Adede (Kenya) 18\r\nMr. Nasrat Mounla Hayder (Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic) 15\r\nMr. Francis M. Ssekandi (Uganda) 7\r\nMr. Enrique P. Syquia (Philippines) 6\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The following three candidates\r\nhave obtained an absolute majority in the Assembly:\r\nMr. Carl-August Fleischhauer, Mr. Shigeru Oda and\r\nMr. Jiuyong Shi.\r\nThe Assembly will have to proceed to another\r\nunrestricted ballot to fill the remaining two vacancies.\r\nBefore proceeding to hold another round of balloting,\r\nI should like to advise representatives that I have been\r\ninformed that Mr. Volodymyr Vassylenko of the Ukraine\r\n51st meeting - Wednesday, 10 November l993 3\r\nwishes to withdraw as a candidate. His name has therefore\r\nbeen deleted from the ballot paper.\r\nI would also like to advise representatives that I have\r\nbeen informed that Mr. Francis M. Ssekandi of Uganda\r\nwishes to withdraw as a candidate.\r\nOnce again, I should like to remind representatives that\r\npursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,\r\n\"After the President has announced the beginning of\r\nvoting, no representative shall interrupt the voting\r\nexcept on a point of order in connection with the actual\r\nconduct of the voting.\"\r\nTherefore, any announcement such as those concerning\r\nwithdrawals of candidature should be made prior to the\r\ncommencement of the voting process, that is to say, the\r\ndistribution of the ballot papers. If there are any such\r\nannouncements, now is the time to make them; otherwise we\r\nwould have to go through the entire process of revising the\r\nballot papers.\r\n* * *\r\nBallot papers will now be distributed. The voting\r\nprocess has now begun.\r\nAll the candidates whose names appear on the ballot\r\npaper are eligible. The names of the three candidates who\r\nhave already obtained an absolute majority of votes,\r\nMr. Carl-August Fleischhauer, Mr. Shigeru Oda,\r\nMr. Shi Jiuyong, and the names of the two candidates who\r\nhave withdrawn their candidatures, Mr. Francis Ssekandi and\r\nMr. Volodymyr Vassylenko, have been deleted from the\r\nballot paper.\r\nOnce again I would remind delegations that only the\r\nnames of two candidates should be marked with a cross.\r\nAny ballot paper on which more than two names are marked\r\nwill be declared invalid. Votes may only be cast for those\r\nwhose names appear on the ballot papers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Yahya (Brunei\r\nDarussalam), Mrs. Valle Camino (Cuba), Ms. Resch\r\n(Finland), Mr. Suziedelis (Lithuania) and Ms. Iiyambo\r\n(Namibia) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nORGANIZATION OF WORK\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Before suspending the meeting for\r\na short while, I should like to inform members of a change\r\nin the programme of work of the General Assembly.\r\nThe introduction of agenda item 41, \"Emergency\r\ninternational assistance for peace, normalcy and\r\nreconstruction of war-stricken Afghanistan\", originally\r\nscheduled for tomorrow morning is postponed to\r\nWednesday, 24 November, in the morning, as the second\r\nitem.\r\nTomorrow morning the Assembly will instead take up\r\nagenda items 16 (a), \"Election of twenty-nine members of\r\nthe Governing Council of the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme\"; 16 (b), \"Election of twelve members of the\r\nWorld Food Council\"; and 16 (c), \"Election of twenty\r\nmembers of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination\"; and agenda item 17 (g), \"Appointment of\r\nmembers of the Committee on Conferences\".\r\nI should also like to announce, concerning agenda\r\nitem 53, \"Revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly\", that I have been conducting consultations in\r\norder to determine how best to continue work started at\r\nprevious sessions, and am now in a position to say that we\r\nwill be establishing an informal open-ended working group\r\nwith a view to carrying out the tasks set forth in resolution\r\n47/233, in order to seek a consensus text before the\r\nconclusion of the current session.\r\nIn order to ensure continuity, I have requested the\r\nPermanent Representative of Sri Lanka and the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Uganda to serve as co-chairmen of this\r\ninformal open-ended working group and thus assist me in\r\nthe task of advancing our work towards the revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 1.30 p.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 15 (continued)\r\nELECTIONS TO FILL VACANCIES IN PRINCIPAL\r\nORGANS:\r\n(c) ELECTION OF FIVE MEMBERS OF THE\r\nINTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE\r\n(i) MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY-\r\nGENERAL (A/48/432-S/26489)\r\n(ii) LIST OF CANDIDATES (A/48/433/Rev.1-\r\nS/26490/Rev.1)\r\n(iii) CURRICULA VITAE (A/48/440-S/26497 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 178\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 177\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of Members voting: 176\r\nRequired majority: 94\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra Leone) 93\r\nMr. Géza Herczegh (Hungary) 87\r\nMr. José Luis Jesus (Cape Verde) 78\r\nMr. Alexander Yankov (Bulgaria) 32\r\nMr. Samuel K. B. Asante (Ghana) 22\r\nMr. Krzysztof Skubiszewski (Poland) 14\r\nMr. Rodger M. A. Chongwe (Zambia) 9\r\nMr. Andronico O. Adede (Kenya) 5\r\nMr. Nasrat Munla Hayder (Syrian Arab Republic) 4\r\nMr. Enrique P. Syquia (Philippines) 2\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Since no candidate has obtained an\r\nabsolute majority in this round of balloting, the Assembly\r\nwill proceed to another unrestricted ballot to fill the\r\nremaining two vacancies. However, in view of the lateness\r\nof the hour, I propose that the next round be postponed until\r\n3.30 p.m.\r\nI should like once again to remind representatives that,\r\npursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure, after the\r\nPresident has announced the beginning of voting, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting, except on a point of\r\norder in connection with the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nTherefore, any announcements such as those concerning the\r\nwithdrawal of candidatures should be made prior to the\r\ncommencement of the voting process - that is, the\r\ndistribution of the ballot papers. This should facilitate the\r\nelection process.\r\nI call on the representative of Kenya.\r\nMr. MUTHAURA (Kenya): I wish, on behalf of my\r\ndelegation, to thank very much all those delegations that\r\nvoted for Mr. Adede of Kenya.\r\nWe put forward the candidature of Mr. Adede because\r\nwe felt very strongly that there was a need to balance the\r\nrepresentation in the International Court of Justice to reflect\r\nour various legal systems. In that regard, we were\r\nconcerned about the representation of the common law in\r\nAfrica.\r\nAs we did not obtain the number of votes that would\r\nhave secured Mr. Adede’s election to the Court, and as we\r\nare still very far below the required minimum, we have\r\ndecided, in consultation with Mr. Adede, to withdraw his\r\ncandidature in the interest of securing consensus on a\r\ncandidate of the type that we should like to have - that is,\r\none able to reflect the common-law concerns in Africa.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I take it from the statement of the\r\nrepresentative of Kenya that the candidate\r\nMr. Andronico O. Adede is withdrawing.\r\nI call on the representative of Ghana.\r\nMr. DANKWA (Ghana): I wish to express the Ghana\r\ndelegation’s gratitude to those who voted for\r\nMr. Samuel K. B. Asante.\r\nThe candidature of Mr. Asante was put forward for the\r\npurpose of creating an opportunity for a more effective\r\ncontribution to the Court - particularly in terms of\r\nrepresentation of the various legal systems. We are all in\r\nagreement about the impeccable credentials of Mr. Asante.\r\nHowever, having taken part in the process, the delegation of\r\nGhana has come to the conclusion that Mr. Asante’s\r\ncandidature should be withdrawn with a view to enhancing\r\nthe prospect of equitable representation on the Court. It is\r\nour pleasure to facilitate the achievement of that end.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I take it from the statement of the\r\nrepresentative of Ghana that the candidate\r\nMr. Samuel K. B. Asante is withdrawing.\r\nI call on the representative of Zambia.\r\n51st meeting - Wednesday, 10 November l993 5\r\nMr. MUSUKA (Zambia): Zambia put forward the\r\ncandidature of Mr. Rodger M. A. Chongwe, a lawyer who\r\nis distinguished not just in our country or in southern Africa\r\nbut in the entire continent of Africa and who has served well\r\nin many international organizations.\r\nThe International Court of Justice was set up to secure\r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes in such a\r\nmanner as to ensure that litigants are satisfied that justice as\r\nthey know it has been done. Like the delegation of Kenya,\r\nwe put up a candidate because we knew that the seat being\r\ncontested was a common-law seat.\r\nWe feel that as the results stand we should support the\r\ncandidate who will be able to serve the legal culture which\r\nGhana, Kenya and Zambia fully support.\r\nWe want to thank sincerely all those who have\r\nsupported our candidate, Mr. Chongwe, and to assure you,\r\nMr. President, of our full support for the candidate who will\r\nbe elected, because we know that he will serve the interests\r\nof the common law and bring about balance within the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nWe beg to withdraw the name of our candidate,\r\nMr. Chongwe.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I take it from the statement made\r\nby the representative of Zambia that Mr. Rodger Chongwe\r\nis withdrawing his candidature.\r\nFrom that statement and the others that have just been\r\nmade we have gathered that Mr. Samuel K. B. Asante,\r\nMr. Rodger Chongwe and Mr. Andronico Adede have\r\nwithdrawn. Those names should therefore be deleted from\r\nthe ballot paper.\r\nTo allow time for the preparation of new ballot papers,\r\nI shall now suspend the meeting until 3.30 p.m., when we\r\nshall resume the balloting process.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 1.45 p.m. and resumed\r\nat 3.50 p.m.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: In accordance with the\r\nannouncement I made this morning, since no candidate has\r\nobtained an absolute majority in the last round of balloting,\r\nthe General Assembly will have to proceed to another\r\nunrestricted ballot to fill the remaining two vacancies.\r\nI call on the representative of Bulgaria, who wishes to\r\nmake an announcement.\r\nMr. LOZANOV (Bulgaria): The Bulgarian delegation,\r\nwith the consent of Mr. Alexander Yankov, Bulgarian\r\ncandidate for election as a member of the International Court\r\nof Justice, and desiring to facilitate the election process and\r\nthe proceedings of the current meeting, is announcing the\r\nwithdrawal of his candidature.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to express, on\r\nbehalf of my Government and Mr. Yankov, our most sincere\r\nthanks and appreciation to all delegations which have lent\r\ntheir support to the Bulgarian candidate.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Representatives have heard the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Bulgaria. The name\r\nof Mr. Alexander Yankov will therefore be deleted from the\r\nballot paper. Once again I remind representatives that,\r\npursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure:\r\n\"After the President has announced the beginning of\r\nvoting, no representative shall interrupt the voting\r\nexcept on a point of order in connection with the actual\r\nconduct of the voting.\"\r\nTherefore, any announcements such as those concerning the\r\nwithdrawal of candidatures should be made prior to the\r\ncommencement of the voting process and the distribution of\r\nballot papers.\r\nBallot papers will now be distributed.\r\nThe voting process has now begun.\r\nAll the candidates whose names appear on the ballot\r\npaper are eligible. The names of the four candidates who\r\nhave withdrawn their candidatures, namely\r\nMr. Andronico Adede, Mr. Samuel K. B. Asante,\r\nMr. Rodger Chongwe and Mr. Alexander Yankov, have been\r\ndeleted from the ballot paper.\r\nAgain I remind delegations that the names of only two\r\ncandidates should be marked with a cross. Any ballot paper\r\non which more than two names are marked will be\r\nconsidered invalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose\r\nnames appear on the ballot papers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Yahya (Brunei\r\nDarussalam), Mrs. Valle Camino (Cuba), Ms. Lehto\r\n(Finland), Mr. Suziedelis (Lithuania) and Ms. Iiyambo\r\n(Namibia) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 4 p.m. and resumed at\r\n5.05 p.m.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 175\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 175\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of Members voting: 174\r\nRequired majority: 94\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra Leone) 120\r\nMr. Géza Herczegh (Hungary) 111\r\nMr. José Luis Jesus (Cape Verde) 81\r\nMr. Krzysztof Skubiszewski (Poland) 19\r\nMr. Nasrat Mounla Hayder (Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic) 5\r\nMr. Enrique P. Syquia (Philippines) 0\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Since Mr. Géza Herczegh and\r\nMr. Abdul Koroma have obtained the required majority, the\r\nfollowing five candidates have now received an absolute\r\nm a j o r i t y i n t h e G e n e r a l A s s e m b l y :\r\nMr. Carl-August Fleischhauer, Mr. Géza Herczegh,\r\nMr. Abdul Koroma, Mr. Shigeru Oda and Mr. Jiuyong Shi.\r\nI have communicated the result of the vote to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, and I have received from\r\nthe President of the Council the following letter:\r\n\"I have the honour to inform you that at the 3309th\r\nmeeting of the Security Council, held on\r\n10 November 1993 for the purpose of electing five\r\nmembers of the International Court of Justice for a\r\nterm of office beginning on 6 February 1994,\r\nMr. Carl-August Fleischhauer, Mr. Géza Herczegh,\r\nMr. José Luis Jesus, Mr. Shigeru Oda and\r\nMr. Jiuyong Shi obtained an absolute majority of\r\nvotes.\"\r\nAs a result of the voting which has taken place\r\nindependently in the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil, the following four candidates have obtained an\r\na b s o l u t e m a j o r i t y i n b o t h b o d i e s :\r\nMr. Carl-August Fleischhauer, Mr. Géza Herczegh,\r\nMr. Shigeru Oda and Mr. Jiuyong Shi. They are therefore\r\nduly elected members of the International Court of Justice to\r\nserve for a nine-year term commencing 6 February 1994. I\r\ntake this opportunity to extend to them the congratulations\r\nof the Assembly on their election.\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of article 11 of the\r\nstatute of the Court, it will be necessary to hold a second\r\nmeeting to fill the remaining vacancy. I propose that this\r\nmeeting should be adjourned and that the second meeting\r\nshould be held immediately to vote on the remaining\r\nvacancy.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.15 p.m.\r\n"
