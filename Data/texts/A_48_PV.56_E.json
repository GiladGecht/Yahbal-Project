"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n56th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nTuesday, 16 November 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 46\r\nQUESTION OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS\r\n(MALVINAS)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: With regard to this item I wish to\r\ncall the attention of the General Assembly to document\r\nA/48/266, which contains a Joint Statement issued in Buenos\r\nAires and London on 12 July 1993 by the Governments of\r\nthe Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Northern Ireland.\r\nSimilarly, taking into account General Assembly\r\ndecision 47/408 of 10 November 1992, I wish to inform\r\nrepresentatives that, following consultations on item 46,\r\n\"Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)\", it is proposed\r\nthat the Assembly decide to postpone consideration of this\r\nitem and to include it in the provisional agenda of its forty-\r\nninth session.\r\nMay I take it therefore that the General Assembly,\r\ntaking into account decision 47/408, wishes to take note of\r\ndocument A/48/266, to which I have referred, and that it is\r\nalso the wish of the General Assembly to postpone\r\nconsideration of the item and to include it in the provisional\r\nagenda of the forty-ninth session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The General Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded its consideration of agenda item 46.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 26\r\nCOOPERATION BETWEEN THE UNITED NATIONS\r\nAND THE CONFERENCE ON SECURITY AND\r\nCOOPERATION IN EUROPE\r\n(a) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL\r\n(A/48/549)\r\n(b) DRAFT RESOLUTION (A/48/L.18)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on the representative of\r\nSweden to introduce draft resolution A/48/L.18.\r\nMr. OSVALD (Sweden): I have the honour to speak\r\nboth in my capacity as Permanent Representative of Sweden\r\nand as representative of the Chairman-in-Office of the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\r\nIt is my pleasure to introduce draft resolution A/48/L.18\r\non Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Before\r\nI continue my statement I wish to make two announcements.\r\nFirst, to the list of sponsors in the printed version of the\r\ndraft resolution, the following names should be added:\r\nBelgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Hungary,\r\nIreland, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Malta,\r\nPortugal, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation,\r\nSan Marino, Slovenia, Spain, Tajikistan, Turkey, Ukraine\r\nand the United States of America.\r\nI also wish to announce that in the English version of\r\nthe draft resolution, in the third preambular paragraph, there\r\nis a typing error. Reference is made to Chapter VII of the\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-87189 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.56\r\n26 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nCharter. That should be Chapter VIII of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThis draft resolution is one reflection of the need jointly\r\nto develop the elements of what has been called interlocking\r\ninstitutions of European security. The challenges ahead, the\r\nnew possibilities given and the complex problems we are\r\nfacing in the CSCE region require us to adjust old structures\r\nand interrelationships and complement them with new\r\ninitiatives.\r\nWhen Sweden assumed responsibility as Chairman of\r\nthe CSCE one year ago the central task was to develop the\r\nCSCE as an instrument in the quest for peace. We therefore\r\nwanted to consolidate the community of values, we wanted\r\nto put emphasis on preventive diplomacy and crisis\r\nmanagement, and we wanted to improve cooperation with\r\nother international organizations and continue to strengthen\r\nCSCE structures.\r\nThe role of the CSCE as an instrument for conflict\r\nprevention and resolution makes increased cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the CSCE not\r\nonly desirable but necessary. Pragmatic and effective work\r\nin the field is necessary in order to prevent conflicts from\r\narising or at least from turning into armed ones and to\r\ncontribute to the resolution of ongoing conflicts.\r\nIt is in this spirit that Sweden during its tenure as\r\nChairman-in-Office of the CSCE has sought to assist in\r\nfinding new ways for this concrete cooperation. The\r\nframework for cooperation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat and the CSCE that was signed in\r\nMay this year by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of\r\nthe CSCE Council, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nSweden, is therefore an important expression of the\r\ncontinuing development of our relations.\r\nThe recent decision by the Assembly to grant observer\r\nstatus to the CSCE will also enable us to develop closer ties\r\nbetween the two organizations to the benefit of the\r\ndevelopment of cooperation in the long run and facilitating\r\nour daily work. This arrangement also means that the\r\nSecretary-General of the CSCE, Mr. Wilhelm Höynck, will\r\ntoday address this Assembly for the first time.\r\nPolitical support from the United Nations, not least\r\nfrom the Security Council, to CSCE activities is an essential\r\ncontribution to United Nations-CSCE cooperation and in\r\nparticular to concrete conflict resolution activities. The\r\nCSCE is consequently developing the means to provide\r\nrelevant information and support to the United Nations and\r\nits decision-making bodies through appropriate channels.\r\nInteraction between the CSCE and the Security Council\r\nenhances a common strategy for common purposes.\r\nIn accordance with the framework on cooperation and\r\ncoordination the two sides now hold consultations on a\r\nregular basis and uphold the frequent exchange of\r\ninformation on relevant issues. Furthermore, close contact\r\nis maintained with developments in each specific undertaking\r\nin order to ensure coordination and complementarity and to\r\navoid duplication. Consultation on joint missions and\r\nexamination of the possibility of joint reports are other\r\nimportant parts of the cooperation under way.\r\nThe need for mutual assistance in the field is an\r\nimportant element of the framework. Cooperation on the\r\nground is of course essential and much time and effort have\r\nbeen invested in order to find ways to implement this\r\nprovision in various conflict areas.\r\nCooperation and coordination have just started. More\r\ncould and should be done. In the field, as well as between\r\nheadquarters, political will should be transformed into\r\ncooperative action.\r\nWhen discussing cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE, it is important to bear in mind that\r\nthe two organizations have different competences and\r\ndifferent comparative advantages. Mutual support and\r\ncoordination should therefore, in our mind, be the guiding\r\nprinciples for such cooperation.\r\nIn practice, this cooperation and coordination can take\r\nand are taking different forms: in one conflict the two\r\norganizations might each tackle separate but coordinated\r\ntasks, while in another, one of them might take the lead,\r\nrelying on political back-up from the other.\r\nThis concept, aimed at a common strategy, flexibility\r\nand the avoidance of duplication of work, is well described\r\nin numerous resolutions and statements issued by this\r\nAssembly, by the Security Council, and by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277).\r\nI would especially like to draw attention to the\r\nstatement made by the Security Council on 28 January 1993\r\ninviting regional arrangements to study ways and means of\r\nfurther improving the coordination of their efforts with those\r\nof the United Nations. The Council stressed that this\r\ninteraction should be flexible and adequate to each specific\r\nsituation.\r\nAllow me to give a few examples of the way in which\r\nthis flexibility is carried out by the CSCE and the United\r\nNations in the CSCE region.\r\nLet me first mention the importance the CSCE attaches\r\nto the implementation of the United Nations sanctions\r\nagainst the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and\r\n56th meeting - Tuesday, 16 November l993 3\r\nMontenegro). The coordinating role played by the CSCE,\r\ntogether with the European Community, in monitoring the\r\nsanctions should be regarded as an active and effective\r\ncontribution to the world community’s efforts to come to\r\ngrips with the tragic situation in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe CSCE is also preparing to take an active part in a\r\ncomprehensive restructuring and rehabilitation programme in\r\nformer Yugoslavia, to be implemented as soon as a peace\r\nagreement is reached.\r\nIn The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the\r\nlong-term spillover mission of the CSCE and the\r\nUNPROFOR/Macedonia command are cooperating closely\r\nto achieve their common goal of preventing the conflict in\r\nformer Yugoslavia from spreading to that Republic.\r\nIn Georgia, the efforts of the United Nations and the\r\nCSCE are increasingly coordinated, on the ground as well as\r\nin the ongoing endeavours to find a peaceful settlement of\r\nthe conflicts. The invitation to the CSCE to participate in\r\nthe future peace talks on Abkhazia organized by the United\r\nNations, and vice versa on South Ossetia, are important\r\nsteps. Mutual liaison in observer missions is a possibility to\r\nbe considered.\r\nIn Tajikistan, the United Nations and the CSCE can in\r\njoint action play mutually supporting roles in trying to help\r\nthat country emerge from its present plight.\r\nThe efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in\r\nand around Nagorny Karabakh within the CSCE Minsk\r\nprocess is being strengthened by political support from the\r\nSecurity Council, manifested once again last week with the\r\nadoption of resolution 884 (1993).\r\nA trilateral discussion on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations, the CSCE and the Council of Europe\r\nregarding human rights and the human dimension was\r\ninitiated by the CSCE this summer with the aim of\r\npromoting human rights and democratic values.\r\nIt is a great challenge, for both the United Nations and\r\nthe CSCE, to try to develop new forms of cooperation and\r\ncoordination in this volatile period in the CSCE region. The\r\nGeneral Assembly can make a contribution to this work here\r\ntoday by unanimously adopting draft resolution A/48/L.18.\r\nMr. SHUSTOV (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): First of all, I would like say that we share\r\nthe hope of the representative of Sweden that draft resolution\r\nA/48/L.18, which we are discussing, will be adopted\r\nunanimously. On behalf of my own delegation, I hope we\r\nwill act in this fashion because what is being discussed here\r\ntoday will be discussed in Vienna on Thursday at the Vienna\r\nForum of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE).\r\nThe Russian Federation believes in the development of\r\nclose and multifaceted cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE. We view the CSCE as the leading\r\npan-European organization, one which plays a priority role\r\nwith respect to other European associations. We are\r\nconvinced that the CSCE is an institution that plays a unique\r\nrole in the strengthening of security and stability on the\r\nEuropean continent and in the Asian countries of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and in the\r\nprevention and settlement of ethnic and other conflicts. The\r\nRussian Federation believes in the active development of\r\ncollective mechanisms to be used by the CSCE for the\r\nprevention and settlement of crises and for a substantial\r\nincrease in its peace-keeping potential; we feel that this\r\nyoung international organization should be able to make\r\nmore active use of the experience, both positive and\r\nnegative, accumulated by the United Nations in conducting\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nThe Russian Federation believes that mutual support\r\nand interaction in promoting peace and stability should\r\nbecome the central element of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE. At the same time, it seems\r\nquite important that the role and potential of the United\r\nNations Security Council will increase as a result of the\r\ndevelopment of active cooperation with the growing potential\r\nof the CSCE.\r\nIt is also our belief that the CSCE, as a regional\r\nagreement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the United\r\nNations Charter, is the major partner of the United Nations\r\nin the area of peace-keeping in the European and Atlantic\r\nregion. That is why we will, together with other member\r\nStates of the CSCE, continue in our efforts to strengthen the\r\nlegal and organizational basis of the CSCE as a regional\r\nassociation. We hope the time will come when the CSCE\r\nwill change its name from the \"Conference\" to the\r\n\"Organization\" on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\r\nIn this area, we have already taken some important\r\nsteps, and on behalf of my delegation I would like to follow\r\nthe representative of Sweden in welcoming here to this\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly the Secretary-General of\r\nthe CSCE, Ambassador Wilhelm Höynck.\r\nThe experience of peacemaking activities in former\r\nYugoslavia, Nagorny Karabakh, Abkhazia, South Ossetia,\r\nTransnistria and other conflict areas has shown that the\r\nefficiency of the efforts of members of the international\r\ncommunity depends largely on the measure of coordination\r\nand the sharing of responsibility between different\r\ninternational and regional structures.\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn this process, it is important to act gradually and\r\nrealistically. A simplistic and one-sided approach is out of\r\nplace. Experience has shown that the combination of efforts\r\nby regional organizations with United Nations activities must\r\nbe flexible and must correspond to specific situations.\r\nFor that reason, without diminishing the importance of\r\nother issues, it is important to pay particular attention to a\r\nrational distribution of functions between the United Nations\r\nand the CSCE in their anti-crisis actions.\r\nThe Russian delegation believes that the CSCE could\r\nassume more solid political responsibility for peace-keeping\r\nactivities within its geographic zone. We would welcome\r\nthe eventual broader competence and structural\r\nreinforcement of the CSCE in decision-making and planning,\r\nand in conducting peace-keeping operations and exercising\r\ncontrol over them. At the same time, the present concept of\r\nCSCE peace-keeping activities continues to impose certain\r\nlimitations that exclude the elements of peace enforcement.\r\nHowever, at this stage it may actually be an advantage in\r\nterms of a division of labour between the two organizations.\r\nIt would be appropriate to focus the interaction between\r\nthe United Nations and the CSCE in the area of peace-\r\nkeeping on establishing a dialogue on doctrinal aspects and\r\nthe exchange of information, and on conducting joint actions,\r\nincluding the establishment of joint United Nations-CSCE missions -\r\nfor example, observation or fact-finding missions. In\r\naddition, it would be appropriate to provide both for the\r\npossibility of including individual representatives of one of\r\nthe organizations in the missions of the other and for the\r\nestablishment of full-fledged joint missions with a single\r\nmandate and under common leadership. At the same time,\r\nthe Security Council in its resolutions could confirm and\r\nsupport the decisions of the CSCE and also give instructions\r\nto the CSCE, which is a regional organization.\r\nThe issue of cooperation between the CSCE and the\r\nUnited Nations in mutually ensuring the security of mission\r\npersonnel is becoming ever more topical. This idea could be\r\nimplemented in practice at this stage through, for example,\r\nthe conclusion of an agreement between the United Nations\r\nforces stationed in the territory of The Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia and the CSCE mission deployed\r\nthere on the inclusion of CSCE representatives in United\r\nNations evacuation plans in case of emergencies.\r\nIn our view, it would be advisable for the CSCE in\r\ncoming years to consolidate its orientation towards early\r\nwarning and the use of preventive political and diplomatic\r\nmeans of influence, without trying, for the time being, to\r\ncreate within its framework the material base for peace-\r\nkeeping operations. The task of the CSCE should consist\r\nfirst of all in detecting, localizing and seeking to avert crises,\r\nestablishing a dialogue between parties in conflict, and\r\nensuring observance of cease-fires.\r\nThe CSCE could consider the specific issue of\r\nassuming certain responsibilities in post-crisis settlement in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, thus supplementing the efforts of the\r\nEuropean Community and releasing the United Nations from\r\nits long-standing involvement in the rehabilitation of this\r\nregion. I must say that a very interesting proposal in this\r\nregard was submitted to the CSCE by the delegation of\r\nSweden. Incidentally, this could be a gesture towards those\r\ncountries that have shown concern about the particular\r\nattention apparently paid by the United Nations to the\r\nYugoslav crisis.\r\nWe are just beginning to comprehend the issue of the\r\nrational distribution of responsibilities between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE in the settlement of crises and\r\nconflicts throughout the territory of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States. It may be precisely in this area that we\r\nshould test by practical experience the idea of joint United\r\nNations-CSCE missions. To start, we could try to apply this\r\nidea in Tajikistan. Such a mission could, in particular,\r\npromote dialogue between the Government and the\r\nopposition, contribute to the solution of the refugee problem\r\nand launch the development of guarantees of the rights of all\r\nethnic groups.\r\nIn the context of possible interaction between the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE in the area of early warning,\r\nideas have been put forth concerning the establishment,\r\nunder the auspices of the CSCE, of its own peace-keeping\r\nforces along the lines of the future stand-by forces of the\r\nUnited Nations. In our opinion, we could discuss at this\r\nstage a formula for joint use of the future stand-by forces on\r\nthe understanding that the United Nations could promote the\r\nuse for CSCE purposes of contingents that were idle at any\r\ngiven moment. At any rate, all these ideas deserve to be\r\ndiscussed by the United Nations and the CSCE.\r\nPeace-keeping, which I have discussed in some detail,\r\nis the central but not the only sphere of cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the CSCE. There is a perceived\r\nneed to develop closer links between the CSCE Warsaw\r\nOffice for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the\r\nUnited Nations Centre for Human Rights, in particular to\r\nensure a more rapid exchange of information between them.\r\nSuch cooperation will undoubtedly stimulate the activities of\r\nboth organizations in the establishment of democratic values\r\nand human rights.\r\nWe feel that the strengthening of interaction between\r\nthe CSCE Economic Forum and the United Nations\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe - with a view to\r\n56th meeting - Tuesday, 16 November l993 5\r\nproviding assistance to CSCE member States in carrying out\r\ntheir economic reforms - also has good prospects.\r\nThe establishment of a regular exchange of opinions\r\nand information between the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Chairman-in-Office of the Council of the\r\nCSCE, as well as the CSCE Secretary-General as the\r\nrepresentative of the Chairman-in-Office, has acquired a\r\ngreat importance. In this connection, we attach particular\r\nimportance to the document entitled \"Framework for\r\ncooperation and coordination between the United Nations\r\nSecretariat and the Conference on Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe\". We hope that the provisions contained in this\r\ndocument will be further developed.\r\nWe are certain that the adoption by the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session of the draft resolution\r\nentitled \"Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\" and\r\nco-sponsored by the Russian Federation, will, as the\r\nAmbassador of Sweden has said, lend new impetus to the\r\nstrengthening of interaction between these two organizations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that the discussion\r\nof this problem in the General Assembly is of great practical\r\nimportance, since it is taking place on the eve of the meeting\r\nin Rome of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the 53 CSCE\r\nmember States, which will serve as an important landmark\r\nin the development of the CSCE as an effective international\r\norganization. On behalf of our delegation, I should like to\r\nask the Secretary-General, Mr. Höynk, to report to the\r\nVienna Forum of the CSCE on the discussion of the draft\r\nresolution at the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. BOTEZ (Romania) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe formal coordination of the activities of the United\r\nNations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE) is a new subject that undoubtedly deserves\r\nto be inscribed on the evolving agenda of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nHowever, I feel that in fact such coordination did not\r\nbegin with the adoption by the General Assembly at its last\r\nsession of resolution 47/10, which opens the chapter of\r\ninstitutional contacts and joint action. Rather, it seems to\r\nme that this resolution gives formal expression to a structure\r\nthat has been coming into closer harmony since the mid-\r\n1970s, when first the spirit and then the process which we\r\nhave come to call the \"Helsinki\" spirit and process were\r\nestablished in the geographical space that generated the two\r\nmajor conflagrations of this century. I believe that the world\r\ntoday cannot be understood in isolation from the history of\r\nthe harmonization between the United Nations and the\r\nCSCE.\r\nIndeed, the international situation following the end of\r\nthe cold war gives us a different view of the past. To cite\r\nBorges, every great writer discovers or even invents a line\r\nof predecessors that justifies him. In today’s world we\r\nunderstand even better than we did in 1975 the importance\r\nof the United Nations and the Helsinki process for the\r\nEurope today and for mankind as a whole. From among the\r\nills of recent decades, it is their spirit that should be kept as\r\nthe precursor of the realities of 1993. But this new reading\r\nof history also suggests a sort of distribution of roles which\r\nwas not noticed in the past but which can, I believe, be\r\nsustained from our present viewpoint.\r\nI would say, at the risk of didactic oversimplification,\r\nthat, at least for us in Europe, the United Nations and the\r\nHelsinki Conference play complementary roles. In the\r\nUnited Nations the main issue was safeguarding peace, in an\r\nattempt to reduce as much as possible the risk of\r\nconfrontation between States or groups of States. We could\r\nthus speak of a scope embracing external, international\r\nstructures of peace and security. In our view at least, the\r\nHelsinki spirit also related to internal or intra-national\r\nstructures of peace and security. There is no need to repeat\r\nthat respect for human rights in prosperous and stable\r\ndemocracies diminishes the risk of confrontation.\r\nAllow me, as a representative of a country that\r\nslumbered under dictatorship for almost half a century, to\r\nmention here, for example, the immense role played by the\r\nfamous \"third basket\" concerning human rights for the\r\nprotection of anti-totalitarian dissent and for the development\r\nof civilian society in Central and Eastern Europe, phenomena\r\nin the absence of which the anti-communist revolutions of\r\n1989 cannot be explained. \"Solidarnose\" in Poland,\r\nCharter 77 in Czechoslovakia and the Free Trade Union in\r\nRomania, to give but a few examples, are all expressions of\r\nthe Helsinki spirit, and the new Europe remains extremely\r\ngrateful to those who embarked on and followed up this\r\nprocess.\r\nThe collapse of communism in Central and Eastern\r\nEurope opened up a new chapter in the history of the United\r\nNations, in the evolution of the spirit and process of\r\nHelsinki, and also in their possible relationships. The United\r\nNations, hindered for decades by the cold war, can finally\r\nbegin to shoulder its planetary responsibilities.\r\nThe Helsinki process has also gathered new momentum.\r\nDifferences between external and internal structures of peace\r\nseem to be disappearing in a Europe where dictatorship has\r\ndisappeared and where, theoretically, at least, pluralistic\r\ndemocracy and market economies have triumphed. Even\r\nmore clearly than before, the United Nations and the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)\r\nmust be seen as different political expressions of the same\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nspirit, marked by understanding, diversity and cooperation.\r\nAt the Helsinki Summit in July 1992, participating States\r\ndeclared that the CSCE was a regional arrangement in the\r\nsense of the United Nations Charter and that as such it\r\nprovided an important link between European and global\r\nsecurity. The cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe CSCE and with any other regional structure is on two\r\nessential levels: first, a conceptual and theoretical level\r\nwhere an attempt is made to define the fundamental political\r\nmeaning of such cooperation and, secondly, a level of means\r\nand practical action, from a pragmatic and operational\r\nperspective.\r\nTheoretically, the scope of the possibilities for\r\ncooperation is remarkable. Suffice it to mention here the\r\npotential of regional organizations in the discharge of\r\nfunctions such as preventive diplomacy, the maintenance of\r\npeace, the restoration of peace and the consolidation of\r\nstability and peace after conflicts, as pointed out in the\r\nexcellent report \"An Agenda for Peace\" of His Excellency\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. But this\r\ntheoretical scope of cooperation must be explored and\r\nutilized. Our task here is that of creating the institutional\r\nframework for such action.\r\nFrom the standpoint of means and practical actions, the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/48/549) of 2 November 1993\r\non cooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE\r\npaints a stimulating and promising picture. Suffice it to\r\nmention by way of example the determination and\r\npromptness with which the CSCE, upon the request of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova and in coordination with the United\r\nNations, got involved in the settlement of the grave situation\r\nfacing the Government of the Republic of Moldova in the\r\neastern part of the country, where the troops of a foreign\r\narmy are still to be found.\r\nAs we can all see, cooperation and interaction between\r\nthe United Nations and the CSCE is under way. In\r\nresolution 48/5 the CSCE was granted observer status in the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly. The exchange of letters,\r\nin May 1993, between the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations and the Chairman-in-Office of the Council of the\r\nCSCE was also a significant step in this cooperation. It is\r\na duty, not merely an honour and a pleasure, to pay a special\r\nt r i b u t e h e r e t o t h e S e c r e t a r y - G e n e r a l ,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and Mrs. Margaretha af Ugglas,\r\nForeign Minister of Sweden and current Chairman-in-Office\r\nof the CSCE, for their personal contribution to this process.\r\nIn the present era, saturated with holistic, systemic and\r\nglobalistic approaches, there is no longer any need to repeat\r\nthat the whole is not merely the mechanical sum of its parts\r\nand that the part is not reducible to a mere fragment of the\r\nwhole. The world as a whole, which is the scope of the\r\nUnited Nations, and Europe, or the Euro-Atlantic space, on\r\nwhich the CSCE focuses, cannot, hence, be seen from the\r\nstandpoint of simple inclusion, as a mathematician might\r\nsay. There exists a globalist spirit and a European or Euro-\r\nAtlantic spirit. There is a new awareness, evolved over\r\nrecent decades, that makes it possible to understand that\r\npeoples, countries and regions can be and remain different\r\nwithout any loss of pride or standing. This prospect of\r\ntolerant globalization and constructive regionalization must,\r\nI believe, dominate relations between the United Nations and\r\nthe CSCE. With this approach their cooperation becomes a\r\nproject to be defined rather than a decision to be taken.\r\nIt is often said that for a problem to be solved it must\r\nfirst be correctly formulated. But it is a commonplace that,\r\nparticularly in the world of politics, the formulation of\r\nproblems is the domain of dialogue. Draft resolution\r\nA/48/L.18, prepared with remarkable diligence by the\r\nSwedish delegation, assures us that such a dialogue will\r\ncontinue next year. As a sponsor of this draft resolution, we\r\nexpress the hope that it will be adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. SUCHARIPA (Austria): Austria fully concurs with\r\nthe Secretary-General’s view, expressed in \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\", that\r\n\"regional arrangements ... in many cases possess a\r\npotential that should be utilized\". (A/47/277, para. 64)\r\nOver the last year we have witnessed a considerable\r\nincrease in cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional arrangements such as the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), the Organization of American States (OAS)\r\nand the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(CSCE). This positive trend finally brought about an\r\nimplementation of the principle of complementarity, which\r\nis, of course, an underlying idea of Chapter VIII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe participating States of the CSCE reaffirmed in the\r\nFinal Act signed at Helsinki in 1975 their\r\n\"full and active support for the United Nations and for\r\nthe enhancement of its role and effectiveness in\r\nstrengthening international peace, security and justice\".\r\n(CSCE, Final Act, 1975, \"Declaration on principles\r\nguiding relations between participating States\", third\r\npreambular paragraph)\r\nThey also explicitly declared at the Helsinki Summit in 1992\r\nthat the CSCE is a regional arrangement in the spirit of\r\nChapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, and, as such,\r\nthat it provides an important link between European and\r\nglobal security.\r\n56th meeting - Tuesday, 16 November l993 7\r\nConsequently, last year, in resolution 47/10, the General\r\nAssembly had already stressed the need for enhanced\r\ncooperation and coordination between the CSCE and the\r\nUnited Nations. A month ago, it granted observer status to\r\nthe CSCE with the adoption of resolution 48/5. We\r\ntherefore have the pleasure today to welcome\r\nAmbassador Höynck, Secretary-General of the CSCE, as\r\nobserver.\r\nFree of regulatory restrictions, the CSCE has been able\r\nin a relatively short period of time to elaborate a\r\ncomprehensive set of political instruments for conflict\r\nprevention and conflict resolution. Those already applied in\r\npractice have proven to be extremely successful, as CSCE\r\nmissions in crisis areas have shown. They operate on the\r\nbasis of flexible mandates covering political, military and\r\nhuman rights issues.\r\nLet me just mention some examples and how they\r\nrelate to various United Nations efforts: the CSCE has\r\ndeployed missions of long duration in Kosovo, Sandjak and\r\nVojvodina, in areas of conflict or potential conflict in former\r\nYugoslavia, where the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) is not deployed. The very presence and\r\nactivities of these missions had a positive effect on\r\ndevelopments there; Austria was glad to have been able to\r\nparticipate in those missions. The Belgrade authorities,\r\nhowever, refused to extend the protocol agreement\r\nauthorizing the deployment of the missions, thereby,\r\nde facto, ending their activities. In response to that act, the\r\nSecurity Council adopted its resolution 855 (1993),\r\nrequesting the Belgrade authorities to reconsider their\r\nposition and to cooperate with the CSCE. Unfortunately,\r\nthis has not been done to date.\r\nFurthermore, the CSCE has assisted the neighbouring\r\nStates of Serbia and Montenegro in monitoring the\r\nobservance of sanctions imposed by the Security Council.\r\nIn this regard, cooperation with the relevant unit of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat is vital.\r\nThe Security Council has on a number of occasions\r\nsupported the efforts of the CSCE, and in particular the\r\nMinsk Group, to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict\r\nin and around the Nagorny Karabakh region of the\r\nAzerbaijani Republic. In this case as in some others, the\r\nCSCE is taking the lead role according to an agreed\r\ndistribution of tasks between itself and the United Nations.\r\nCooperation on the ground between missions of both\r\nthe United Nations and the CSCE has begun in Georgia and\r\nTajikistan. We are aware of the complex situations there\r\nand hope that the practical contacts between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE missions will soon be strengthened\r\nand will lead to full cooperation.\r\nThese concrete examples clearly show the increasing\r\nimportance of enhancing cooperation and coordination\r\nbetween the United Nations and the CSCE. Austria\r\ntherefore welcomes the exchange of letters of 26 May 1993\r\nbetween the Secretary-General and the Chairman-in-Office\r\nof the CSCE Council, which provides a framework for\r\ncooperation and coordination between the United Nations\r\nand the CSCE. In those letters the two sides agreed to\r\nmaintain close contact to ensure coordination,\r\ncomplementarity and mutual support, and to avoid possible\r\nduplication in the planning and carrying out of activities. In\r\norder to achieve these aims, consultations and contacts on a\r\ndaily basis are necessary. Let me take this opportunity to\r\npay a tribute to Ambassador Peter Osvald, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE,\r\nSweden, whose Mission has pursued the implementation of\r\nthe framework in an exemplary manner.\r\nHowever, increasing the practical implementation of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE will\r\nnot be possible without having a United Nations liaison\r\nmechanism to the CSCE at the site of most of its bodies,\r\nVienna. The framework set out in the exchange of letters\r\nexplicitly mentions three points of contact in Vienna: the\r\ndelegation of the State holding the office of Chairman, the\r\nCSCE Secretary-General and other CSCE institutions in\r\nVienna, such as the Conflict Prevention Centre. The current\r\ndevelopments, in particular the rapidly increasing activities\r\nof the CSCE and the henceforth permanent meetings of the\r\nrelevant CSCE bodies, first and foremost the Committee of\r\nSenior Officials - the Vienna Group - clearly necessitate\r\ncreating such a liaison mechanism between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE in Vienna. Given the presence of\r\nvarious units and services of the United Nations Secretariat\r\nin Vienna, such a step should not provide any administrative\r\nproblems.\r\nWhile we welcome the growing cooperation, we see\r\nroom for improvement and a vast potential for intensification\r\nto the benefit of all interested parties. Austria firmly\r\nbelieves that cooperation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE in the interest of peace and\r\nsecurity should be further enhanced and developed.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to propose that the\r\nlist of speakers in the debate on this item be closed now. If\r\nI hear no objection, I shall take it that the Assembly agrees\r\nto that proposal.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. HUSLID (Norway): Norway welcomes the report\r\nof the Secretary-General on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE). The need for enhanced cooperation and\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncoordination has been stressed ever since the CSCE summit\r\nmeeting took place in Helsinki 16 months ago.\r\nThe exchange of letters of 26 May between the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and the Chairman-\r\nin-Office of the CSCE on the arrangements for cooperation\r\nand coordination established a framework for common\r\napproaches. The decision of 13 October to grant the CSCE\r\nobserver status in the General Assembly strengthens further\r\nthe basis for increasingly close cooperation and coordination.\r\nThe decisions of the Helsinki meeting defined an\r\nimportant CSCE role in early warning, conflict prevention\r\nand crisis management. That role has been filled, through\r\nconcrete actions in conflict areas as well as areas of tension\r\ninvolving national minority issues that have the potential to\r\ndevelop into a conflict. Seven CSCE missions have been\r\ndispatched to areas of the former Yugoslavia and the former\r\nSoviet Union, and a peace-keeping operation has been\r\nprepared for Nagorny Karabakh.\r\nThe High Commissioner on National Minorities plays\r\nan important role in early warning. We consider that his\r\nactivities have been very useful and important. However,\r\nthere is scope for increasing the effectiveness of the CSCE’s\r\nown activities. The CSCE has also an indisputable potential\r\nfor assisting the United Nations in carrying out United\r\nNations decisions on several important issues ranging from\r\nhuman rights to conflict prevention.\r\nIt is stated in the CSCE Helsinki decisions that the\r\nCSCE is a regional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII\r\nof the United Nations Charter and as such provides an\r\nimportant link between European and global security. It is\r\nworth emphasizing that cooperative security can only be\r\nbuilt on complementarity and improved interaction among all\r\nthe relevant international organizations. Progress has been\r\nmade towards this end, but more should and can be done.\r\nRivalry must be avoided here, and a pragmatic approach is\r\nnecessary. There are really enough tasks for everybody.\r\nThe new tasks before the CSCE require enhanced\r\npractical coordination and cooperation with the United\r\nNations. This is particularly important in conflict areas\r\nwhere both the CSCE and the United Nations have a\r\npresence, as in Georgia, Nagorny Karabakh and Tajikistan.\r\nThe activities in those areas should be coordinated in order\r\nto be mutually reinforcing, and it is important to avoid\r\nduplication in planning activities.\r\nWhile the United Nations has a responsibility for global\r\nsecurity, the CSCE has a particular responsibility for the\r\nsecurity and stability of Europe. We therefore find it useful\r\nthat the CSCE and the United Nations consult prior to any\r\ndecision on establishing new missions in the CSCE area.\r\nThe aim of such consultation should be to obtain a division\r\nof labour that would benefit all parties. The first question to\r\nbe raised is which of the two organizations is best suited to\r\nestablish a mission.\r\nNorway would like to emphasize that this should be a\r\ncontinuous process. Formal arrangements for mutual\r\nexchange of information should be supplemented by\r\ninformal contacts as part of the normal working routines of\r\nthe CSCE and the United Nations personnel involved in\r\nmatters of common concern. At the same time, the dialogue\r\nbetween the Secretary-General and the Chairman-in-Office\r\nshould continue on a regular basis. We are convinced that\r\nthis would result in increased efficiency and a wider capacity\r\nfor addressing new challenges. Frequent contacts at all\r\nlevels would facilitate a pragmatic division of labour in each\r\ncase.\r\nI conclude by stating that Norway supports the draft\r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe CSCE.\r\nMr. BROUHNS (Belgium) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union on the question of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE). I should like to welcome\r\nthe presence among us of the CSCE Secretary-General,\r\nAmbassador Wilhelm Höynck.\r\nAt the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly\r\nwe welcomed the inclusion of this new item on its agenda.\r\nToday we reiterate our support for the consideration of this\r\nitem, which has recently taken on even greater importance.\r\nThe CSCE, which emerged from the cold war, must\r\ntoday take up new challenges, including the resurgence of\r\nnationalism, ethnic conflicts, intolerance and xenophobia.\r\nThe CSCE’s approach to those challenges is based on a\r\ncomprehensive concept of security, that concept establishes\r\na relationship between the maintenance of peace and respect\r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms. It creates a\r\nlink between cooperation in the fields of the economy and\r\nthe environment, on the one hand, and, on the other hand,\r\npeaceful relations between States. This comprehensive\r\nconcept is the basis of the CSCE’s preventive diplomacy.\r\nMoreover, the CSCE has now acquired new\r\ninstruments. The powers of the Council and of the\r\nCommittee of Senior Officials have been strengthened,\r\nenabling them, for example, to dispatch missions to crisis\r\nregions. The establishment of the office of CSCE High\r\nCommissioner on National Minorities has helped to\r\nstrengthen the CSCE’s capacity to avert tension and potential\r\nconflict. Lastly, the CSCE now has peace-keeping tools,\r\n56th meeting - Tuesday, 16 November l993 9\r\nsuch as the deployment of observation and monitoring\r\nmissions in conflict zones. In that connection, we welcome\r\nthe forthcoming meeting of the CSCE ministerial Council, to\r\nbe held on 30 November and 1 December in Rome, where\r\nthe mechanisms and structures of the CSCE are to be further\r\nstrengthened.\r\nAt the end of the Helsinki Summit last July, the Heads\r\nof State and Government of the CSCE declared their\r\nunderstanding that the CSCE was a regional arrangement in\r\nthe sense of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. That declaration opened the way towards greater\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE,\r\nwhich the Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nwelcomed in his report, \"An Agenda for Peace.\"\r\nIn the past few months cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE has been demonstrated in various\r\ncrises. In support of United Nations efforts in the former\r\nYugoslavia the CSCE has deployed long-term missions in\r\nKosovo, Sandjak, Vojvodina and The Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia. It has also assisted in investigations\r\nof human rights violations, inter alia, by sending in 1992 a\r\nmission to investigate human rights violations and to\r\nexamine living conditions in detention camps. It has also\r\nassisted neighbouring States to monitor compliance with\r\nSecurity Council sanctions.\r\nIn other crises the CSCE, with United Nations support,\r\nhas become the principal mediator, particularly concerning\r\nthe conflict in Nagorny Karabakh, with regard to which the\r\nSecurity Council has several times called upon the parties to\r\nresume negotiations within the context of the Minsk Group\r\npeace process.\r\nWhile cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCSCE in conflict prevention and resolution has been\r\nstrengthened, we should also emphasize cooperation with the\r\nCommission on Human Rights in the human-rights field;\r\nwith the Economic Commission for Europe with regard to\r\nthe economy and the environment; and with the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with\r\nregard to refugees and minorities.\r\nExchange of information between the CSCE and the\r\nUnited Nations is already well established. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral is represented at meetings of the Committee of\r\nSenior Officials and will be sending a representative to the\r\nRome Council meeting. There is also a regular exchange of\r\ninformation between the Mission of the CSCE Chairman-in-\r\nOffice in New York and the United Nations Secretariat. In\r\nthis connection, we welcome the efforts of the Swedish\r\nChairman-in-Office, and we trust that contacts will become\r\neven stronger in future.\r\nMrs. Fritsche (Liechtenstein), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe examples I have given only illustrate the growing\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE.\r\nThis cooperation should be strengthened in future. To that\r\nend, Mrs. Af Ugglas, the Swedish Foreign Minister and\r\nChairman-in-Office of the CSCE, had an exchange of letters\r\nwith the Secretary-General of the United Nations last May\r\nwith a view to establishing a framework for cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the CSCE. On\r\n30 October last the General Assembly adopted a resolution\r\ninviting the CSCE to participate in its work as an Observer.\r\nIn view of the complexity and diversity of the questions\r\nthat confront and will in future confront the United Nations\r\nand the CSCE, cooperation and coordination between them\r\nwill have based more on pragmatism than on a rigid\r\nframework of principles, which could very quickly prove to\r\nbe inadequate. The goal of maintaining peace in the CSCE\r\nregion cannot but benefit from greater cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the CSCE, which can in turn gain\r\nfrom a flexible synergy of each organization’s experience,\r\ncompetence, and means of action. We trust there will be\r\nmore active cooperation and coordination on the ground.\r\nWhere the situation justifies it, this could involve appointing\r\nsomeone to represent both the United Nations and the CSCE.\r\nFully aware of the contribution that can be made to\r\nglobal stability, the European Union encourages this\r\ncooperation and welcomes the debate now taking place in\r\nthe General Assembly on this item.\r\nMr. BREITENSTEIN (Finland): Last year Finland\r\nco-sponsored the draft resolution which initiated the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Conference\r\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). This year\r\nthe General Assembly has taken a step further as it has\r\nunanimously invited the CSCE to participate in the\r\nAssembly’s sessions and work as an Observer.\r\nWe welcome this development. The capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations for action in conflict prevention and in crisis\r\nmanagement has for some time been stretched to the limit.\r\nIt is therefore both necessary and natural that the potential\r\nof other institutions should be used whenever possible.\r\nRecognizing this, the leaders of the States participating in\r\nthe CSCE decided at the Helsinki Summit in 1992 that the\r\nCSCE should be considered a regional arrangement in the\r\nmeaning of Chapter VIII of the Charter. This decision is\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nfully in conformity with the concept of mutually supportive\r\nroles for the United Nations and regional organizations as set\r\nout in the Secretary-General’s report \"An Agenda for Peace\"\r\n(A/47/277). The CSCE is indeed a natural partner for\r\ncooperation with the United Nations.\r\nDuring the past year cooperation and coordination of\r\nactivities between the United Nations and the CSCE have\r\nbeen initiated in several conflict areas. Useful experience\r\nhas already been gained for instance in Abkhazia and South\r\nOssetia, where the United Nations and the CSCE both have\r\nmissions. A de facto division of labour has emerged\r\nbetween the United Nations and the CSCE in other conflict\r\nareas as well. The United Nations has the lead in Tajikistan,\r\nwhere CSCE involvement is under consideration. The CSCE\r\nplays a leading role in the attempts to settle the conflict\r\nbetween Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorny Karabakh.\r\nIt is also involved in Moldova.\r\nFurthermore, in the Framework for cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the CSCE it\r\nwas agreed that the Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nand the Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE should hold\r\nconsultations on a regular basis on activities of common\r\ninterest. It is understandable that it will take some time for\r\nthe practical forms of this cooperation to evolve and\r\ndevelop. The missions in Georgia show us how important\r\nit is to achieve good and effective cooperation. Conflicts of\r\ninterest and duplication of work should, and can, be avoided\r\nthrough a good working relationship between the missions.\r\nWhere difficulties occur, they can certainly be overcome\r\nthrough mutual efforts and good will. It is also imperative\r\nthat the respective missions present a harmonious and united\r\nimage to the local population; otherwise we risk losing\r\ncredibility. This should not be difficult, as the work of the\r\nUnited Nations and that of the CSCE reinforce each other\r\nand have the same goals.\r\nThe challenges which local and regional conflicts in the\r\nCSCE area pose are, unfortunately, enormous. These\r\nchallenges must be met. In this, coordinated efforts by the\r\nUnited Nations, the CSCE and other European and\r\ntransatlantic institutions are needed.\r\nThe Government of Finland wholeheartedly supports the\r\nfurther development of cooperation and coordination between\r\nthe United Nations and the CSCE. The present Framework\r\nagreement provides a good basis for this. Additional efforts\r\nby both institutions are, however, needed if we want to be\r\nable to respond to the growing challenges.\r\nMr. FULCI (Italy): Two weeks from today, during the\r\nministerial Council in Rome, Italy will assume the\r\nchairmanship of the Conference on Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (CSCE). That is why I am speaking after our\r\nBelgian colleague, who made a statement on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union with which we of course entirely agree.\r\nIn the year of its chairmanship of the CSCE, Italy\r\nintends fully to play the political role which is assigned to\r\nthe Chairman by CSCE documents and which includes\r\nrepresenting the CSCE in other countries and organizations.\r\nIn this context, we will work for closer and more regular ties\r\nbetween the CSCE and other international organizations,\r\nparticularly the United Nations. All 53 States members of\r\nthe CSCE recognize the need for stronger ties with the\r\nUnited Nations, whose increasing role in the management of\r\ninternational crises has led it into areas where the CSCE too\r\nhas been forced to step up its engagement.\r\nSo far, the CSCE’s efforts to achieve cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations have followed two basic guidelines:\r\nfirst, achieving agreements on the mechanism for\r\ncollaboration between the United Nations and the CSCE;\r\nand, secondly, obtaining observer status for the CSCE in the\r\nUnited Nations in order that it may participate in the\r\nproceedings of the General Assembly. New points of\r\ncontact have been established in New York, Geneva and\r\nVienna through the missions of the rotating chairmanship of\r\nthe CSCE.\r\nThis course of action has produced the outcome that we\r\nhoped for, thanks in particular to the energetic work of the\r\nSwedish delegation to the United Nations under the\r\nleadership of our colleague Peter Osvald, to whom I wish to\r\nextend my warmest appreciation.\r\nThus began a deeper understanding of the respective\r\nactivities of the United Nations and the CSCE, and a more\r\nconcrete relationship. The first results of these efforts can\r\nbe seen in the understanding reached between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE on The Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, as well as in the decision last April 28 by the\r\nCommittee of Senior Officials to begin negotiating an\r\nagreement on mutual cooperation in Georgia.\r\nAs the next Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE, Italy aims\r\nto further explore all the possibilities, not only for\r\ncooperation between our two organizations but for a true\r\ncoordination of their respective activities.\r\nIt is our intention, first of all, to implement all the\r\nmeasures provided by the framework which has been set up\r\nbetween the United Nations and the CSCE. Duplication of\r\nactivities and gaps should be prevented as much as possible.\r\nThe same applies to utilization of resources, which, as we\r\nknow only too well, are always limited. On a purely\r\npragmatic basis, the two organizations could even alternate\r\nleading and supporting roles in certain peace initiatives.\r\nAbove all, we must take advantage of the potential synergy\r\n56th meeting - Tuesday, 16 November l993 11\r\nbetween the two organizations. We intend to promote and\r\nfurther develop this cooperation in a way appropriate to\r\nvarying circumstances, in the framework of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, which in our view is and must remain the\r\nCSCE’s primary vocation.\r\nIt is our opinion that a greater, more harmonious\r\npolitical and organizational relationship between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE could become a fundamental asset in\r\ndefining a response to tensions and conflicts in the CSCE\r\narea. Concrete cooperation between the two organizations\r\nhas already begun. Let me also cite a few cases, some of\r\nwhich have already been mentioned by previous speakers:\r\nin the former Yugoslavia, through the long-term missions to\r\nKosovo, Sandjak, and Vojvodina mandated by Security\r\nCouncil resolution 855 (1993); through the Corell Mission to\r\nassess the human-rights situation in Croatia and Bosnia,\r\nwhich contributed to the establishment of the International\r\nTribunal in resolution 808 (1993); through Sanction\r\nAdvisory Missions, which guarantee application of the\r\nmeasures imposed by Security Council resolutions\r\n757 (1992) and 820 (1993); in Nagorny Karabakh, where the\r\nwork of the CSCE’s Minsk Group has met the full\r\nencouragement and support of the Security Council; and in\r\nGeorgia and Tajikistan, where the situation on the ground\r\nsuggests that the CSCE and the United Nations can and\r\nshould join forces.\r\nWe believe that these opportunities should be further\r\nstudied, clarified and developed. The fact that the CSCE is\r\na regional organization, as provided for by Chapter VIII of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, carries both definite privileges\r\nand inescapable burdens. Italy is well aware of this and will\r\ndo everything possible to consolidate this cooperation. We\r\nare fully confident that our United Nations interlocutors in\r\nNew York, Geneva and Vienna, and in the specific contexts\r\nof regional crises in the CSCE area, will share this approach.\r\nMr. BATIOUK (Ukraine): Ukraine willingly supports\r\nthe welcome trend towards closer cooperation and interaction\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in all fields of mutual interest -\r\nfirst and foremost in those relating to conflict prevention\r\nand conflict resolution, as well as to protection and\r\npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nProceeding from this stand, Ukraine, as a participant of the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,\r\nsupported the statement of the participating States of the\r\n1992 CSCE Helsinki Summit, which declared that the CSCE\r\nis a regional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nWhile considering the security of Ukraine inseparable\r\nfrom that of all its neighbours, Ukraine stands for the\r\nestablishment of a reliable all-European system of collective\r\nsecurity wherein the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe plays a crucial role. In this regard,\r\nwe welcome the agreement reached between the United\r\nNations Secretary-General and the CSCE Council’s\r\nChairman-in-Office on the framework of cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the CSCE. In\r\nour view, the interaction envisaged by this agreement should\r\nenhance the efficiency of peacemaking efforts by the\r\ninternational community in the conflict areas of the CSCE\r\nregion and, at the same time, avoid unnecessary and costly\r\noverlapping or duplication in these activities. A closer\r\ncooperation between the two organizations will also promote\r\nthe regular exchange of information between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE, especially in the fields of early\r\nwarning and prevention of conflicts, as well as at the stage\r\nof their resolution.\r\nAll peace-keeping and peacemaking activities should be\r\nof a truly international character and must be carried out in\r\nstrict accordance with the United Nations Charter and the\r\nfundamental CSCE documents. We oppose yielding to any\r\nState’s claims for providing it with special powers from the\r\nUnited Nations or the CSCE in the field of maintaining or\r\nrestoring peace in any region or subregion of the world or of\r\nEurope. In accordance with the United Nations Charter and\r\nthe CSCE documents, the mandate for peace-keeping\r\noperations must be endorsed case by case and only at the\r\nofficial request of the Government of the State whose\r\nterritory becomes the scene of those operations. Ukraine\r\nbelieves it advisable to refrain from involving in peace-\r\nkeeping operations countries which are known to be able to\r\nuse their participation in peace-keeping activities for\r\nconsolidating or imposing their political, economic or\r\nmilitary interests in the region.\r\nCurrent realities make it necessary to maintain close\r\ncontact between the United Nations and the CSCE in\r\ncarrying out various missions, ensuring their interaction and\r\nthe exchange of results derived from their activities. We\r\nenvisage and invite the possibility of joint missions, if need\r\nbe. In our opinion, the joint participation of representatives\r\nand experts in relevant conferences and forums held within\r\nthe framework of the United Nations and the CSCE is\r\nessential.\r\nWe believe that the present arrangement on cooperation\r\nand interaction between the United Nations and the CSCE in\r\nthe field of preventing and resolving conflicts is but the first\r\nstep towards solving today’s most pressing and urgent\r\nproblems. That first step must be followed by additional\r\nones which would expand this cooperation to new and\r\nimportant fields. In particular, it is worth examining the\r\npossibility of establishing closer ties between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE in all spheres of human activity.\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe consequences of the recently aggravated problem\r\nof forced migration and the influx of refugees constitute a\r\nserious challenge to security and stability in Europe. None\r\nof the CSCE participating States is able, alone, to cope with\r\nstreams of refugees fraught with tension and instability. In\r\nthis respect, it appears that there is a need to develop\r\ninteraction between, on one hand, the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, which undertakes\r\nimportant and indispensable activities in this field, and, on\r\nthe other hand, the CSCE Office for Democratic Institutions\r\nand Human Rights, which is located in Warsaw.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine joins those States which,\r\nfrom this rostrum, have urged that draft resolution A/48/L.18\r\nbe adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. BATU (Turkey): As a country located at the very\r\nepicentre of the area covered by the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) - an area that stretches\r\nfrom Vancouver to Vladivostok - and as a founding Member\r\nof the United Nations, Turkey is particularly pleased that we\r\nare again considering an item entitled \"Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe\".\r\nSince the adoption of the Helsinki Document 1992 and\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/10, important steps have\r\nbeen taken to establish effective cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE. In this context, Turkey\r\nwelcomes the exchange on 26 May 1993, between the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and the Chairman-\r\nin-Office of the CSCE, of letters concerning a framework for\r\ncooperation and coordination between the United Nations\r\nand the CSCE. General Assembly resolution 48/5 of\r\n13 October 1993, which invites the CSCE to participate, as\r\nan Observer, in the sessions and work of the Assembly,\r\nconstitutes another encouraging development in the right\r\ndirection.\r\nHaving taken note of the Secretary-General’s valuable\r\nreport, my delegation wishes to reaffirm its resolute support\r\nfor his efforts to build on this process of institutionalizing\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE.\r\nSince the end of the cold war it has been our policy to\r\nrefer to the challenges of the new international order.\r\nDespite a sufficiency of creative thinking, however, it has\r\nnot been possible to establish a clear strategy. We believe\r\nthat the starting-point for such a strategy should be\r\nrealization of the fact that action on the challenges we are\r\nfacing today is beyond the means and resources of a single\r\norganization. Thus, we need a collective-security\r\narchitecture of mutually reinforcing institutions, in which all\r\nelements have a role to play. The interaction between global\r\nsecurity and regional security requires effective cooperation\r\nand coordination between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations. In this connection, Turkey believes that the\r\nstill-developing institutionalization of cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the CSCE sets\r\na precedent.\r\nAs the Secretary-General observes in his report, there\r\nhas been valuable cooperation in some parts of the former\r\nYugoslavia and the former Soviet Union. Turkey attaches\r\ngreat importance to effective coordination between the\r\nactivities of the United Nations and those of the CSCE in\r\nthe field of conflict resolution and prevention, particularly in\r\nthe Balkans and the Caucasus. In this respect, we regard the\r\nrefusal of Belgrade to extend the mandate of the long-term\r\nCSCE missions as a further reason for concern. We share\r\nthe Secretary-General’s view that, until their withdrawal,\r\nthese missions contributed significantly to the maintenance\r\nof stability in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina. Therefore,\r\nwe strongly endorse the Security Council’s call, in its\r\nresolution 855 (1993), for their return at the earliest possible\r\ndate.\r\nFollowing the end of the cold war, we embarked on the\r\nprocess of collective and cooperative security. We must\r\nadmit, however, that quite a few opportunities have been lost\r\nalong the way. Hence, we believe that the United Nations,\r\nunder Chapter VIII of its Charter, should continue to develop\r\nadequate channels of communication, coordination and\r\ninteraction with the regional organizations. We must\r\nestablish a more rational and cost-effective division of labour\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations, and\r\nthis must be based on transparency and complementarity.\r\nThe enhancement of security and stability in the vast\r\ngeographical area between Vancouver and Vladivostok is a\r\nchallenging task. It was in this context that my Minister, in\r\nhis address to the General Assembly on 30 September this\r\nyear, made the following call:\r\n\"Turkey lies at the very epicenter of several\r\nregions making up the most turbulent part of the\r\nNorthern hemisphere. We are actively engaged in the\r\npost-cold-war search for new approaches to build peace\r\nthrough multilateral action. Our objective is to\r\nreinforce the international security system. Only the\r\nUnited Nations can provide legitimacy to regional\r\narrangements and institutions should the latter decide to\r\nact in the fields of ... preventive diplomacy, peace-\r\nkeeping and peace enforcement.\r\n\"All three of those categories of action are in\r\ndemand on Turkey’s periphery. My Government\r\ndeploys all of its available assets to help defuse and\r\n56th meeting - Tuesday, 16 November l993 13\r\nresolve these crises. We strive to create and\r\nconsolidate interlinked areas of solidarity and processes\r\nof cooperation.\" (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-eighth Session, Plenary Meetings, 11th\r\nmeeting, p. 127)\r\nWe pledge our commitment to and our support for the\r\ncontinued efforts to rise above the challenges of our times in\r\nthe field of global and regional security.\r\nMr. PASHOVSKI (Bulgaria): I should like, first, to\r\nexpress my satisfaction at the presence of\r\nMr. Wilhelm Höynck, Secretary-General of the Conference\r\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\r\nMr. Höynck has made a remarkable contribution to the\r\ndevelopment of the CSCE process, and I have outstanding\r\nmemories of the work that we have done together.\r\nOver the past year and a half we have witnessed\r\ngenuine and commendable progress in the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe. The dynamic processes on the\r\nEuropean continent and the emergence of real and potential\r\nconflicts and points of tension in the CSCE area demonstrate\r\nthe pressing need for a meaningful response to the\r\nchallenges in the field of European and global security. The\r\ndirect link between, on one hand, peace, stability and\r\nsecurity in the region and, on the other hand, peace, stability\r\nand security in the world at large has prompted the\r\nbeginning of a process of institutionalizing relations between\r\nthe United Nations and European organizations - in\r\nparticular, the CSCE.\r\nBarely a year and a half ago, at the CSCE’s Helsinki\r\nSummit in 1992, the Heads of State and Government of the\r\nparticipating States declared their understanding that the\r\nConference is a regional arrangement in the sense of Chapter\r\nVIII of the United Nations Charter, and it is little more than\r\na year since the question of cooperation between the two\r\nbodies was formally included in the agenda of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. Over this relatively short period\r\nthere has been significant positive development of the two\r\nbodies’ common effort in a number of areas - from conflict\r\nprevention and crisis management to human rights issues and\r\neconomic and environmental problems.\r\nA sound basis for the promotion of the institutional\r\nmodalities of this process has been laid. Bulgaria welcomes\r\nin this regard the conclusion on 26 May 1993 of an\r\nagreement between the United Nations Secretary-General\r\nand the Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE Council on the\r\nFramework for cooperation and coordination between the\r\ntwo organizations. By resolution 48/5, of 13 October 1993,\r\nthe Conference was granted Observer status at the sessions\r\nand in the work of the General Assembly. Regular contact\r\nand exchange of information and documents have been\r\nestablished and maintained.\r\nThis has already yielded noticeable practical results in\r\nthe field. The United Nations and the CSCE have been\r\ncoordinating their actions in peacemaking, achieving\r\nvaluable interaction in such areas of conflict or tension in\r\nthe CSCE area as Nagorny Karabakh, South Ossetia,\r\nMoldova, Tajikistan and Abkhazia, and elsewhere. In the\r\nformer Yugoslavia a positive framework of coordination has\r\nstarted to evolve, joining the efforts of the United Nations,\r\nthe European Community and the CSCE, with the\r\nindispensable contribution of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) and the Western European Union.\r\nCooperation has also been enhanced through the\r\nintroduction of new, more productive forms of coordination\r\nin other equally important areas, such as preventive\r\ndiplomacy and peace-building. We welcome the\r\nstrengthening of relations between the United Nations and\r\nthe CSCE in the spheres of human rights and humanitarian\r\nissues, including the questions of minorities, economic\r\ncooperation and environmental protection.\r\nThe positive momentum of this process, achieved over\r\nthe past period, should be maintained and further developed.\r\nThe emerging principles of cooperation, taking account of\r\nthe need for coordination, complementarity, practical division\r\nof labour and pragmatic approaches, should be further\r\nstrengthened and consistently applied.\r\nThe United Nations has formidable experience and\r\nresources in a number of spheres pertaining to crisis\r\nmanagement, such as peace-keeping, problems related to\r\nrefugees and humanitarian assistance. The CSCE, for its\r\npart, has a valuable record and capabilities in early warning\r\nand democratic institution building. Both organizations have\r\nestablished their presence in conflict regions across the\r\nCSCE area.\r\nThe potential for stepping up practical, mutually\r\nreinforcing cooperation of the planning and carrying out of\r\nvarious missions, ranging from fact-finding to peacemaking\r\nand to assistance in strengthening democratic institutions,\r\nshould be built upon in an effort to provide for even greater\r\ncomplementarity and synergy.\r\nA greater integration of representatives from each\r\norganization into missions launched by the other is\r\nimperative for increased effectiveness. This could prompt a\r\nfurther strengthening of the organizational modalities for\r\nsuch coordination envisaged by the Framework of\r\n26 May 1993. As a first step, a more efficient joint use of\r\nlogistics and personnel, including joint use at the expert and\r\nhigher levels, could be outlined and implemented.\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe requirements of crisis management in the post-cold-\r\nwar period, given the complex nature of today’s conflicts in\r\nthe CSCE area, lead us to contemplate opportunities for\r\nmore global approaches to conflict resolution, involving the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE. In this regard, pilot case\r\nprojects could be launched. They could comprise action\r\nprogrammes for cessation of hostilities, followed by\r\npost-conflict peacemaking and peace-building measures,\r\ninvolving disengagement of forces, deployment of military\r\nand civilian observers, provision of humanitarian assistance\r\nand strengthening of democratic institutions.\r\nNew ground for cooperation has been explored in such\r\nrelatively new spheres for both organizations as assistance in\r\nthe implementation of preventive and enforcement measures,\r\nincluding the imposition of economic sanctions by the\r\nSecurity Council. Practical cooperation and joint action has\r\nbeen launched in this area through the establishment of the\r\nEuropean Community - CSCE Sanctions Assistance Missions\r\nin countries neighbouring the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), and close coordination\r\nwith the Security Council sanctions Committee has been\r\nestablished. This effort should be pursued further, aiming to\r\nexpand its scope by devising forms of cooperation and\r\nmutual support in addressing special economic problems\r\narising from the implementation of these measures.\r\nGreat opportunities are being offered by the ongoing\r\nreform of the CSCE and its growing capabilities in early\r\nwarning, conflict prevention, crisis management, security\r\ncooperation, peaceful settlement of disputes and planning for\r\npeace-keeping operations. It presents new possibilities for\r\nenhancing the institutional modalities of cooperation and\r\ncoordination which should also be examined and utilized.\r\nWe welcome the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/48/549) outlining measures of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE presented to the Assembly at\r\nits current session. In keeping with the need for regular\r\nexamination and widening of the capabilities for enhanced\r\ncoordination, we invite him to continue to focus his attention\r\non this issue and to present his views, recommendations and\r\nproposals at the next sessions of the Assembly.\r\nIn an effort to contribute to enhancing the cooperation\r\nand coordination between the two organizations, a group of\r\nCSCE participating States, including Bulgaria, have\r\nelaborated and put forward a draft resolution for\r\nconsideration in the current debate. We fully share the\r\ncomments made by the representative of the CSCE\r\nChairman-in-Office, who introduced the draft on behalf of\r\nthe co-sponsors, and we hope that it will gain the support of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. CASSAR (Malta): In November 1990 the Heads\r\nof State or Government of the States participating in the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\nassembled in Paris at a time of \"profound change and\r\nhistoric expectations\" (A/45/859, p. 4) to celebrate the end\r\nof an era of confrontation and division in Europe and to\r\nadopt the Charter of Paris for a New Europe.\r\nThe Charter required a steadfast commitment to\r\ndemocracy, based on human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, prosperity through economic liberty and social\r\njustice, and equal security for all CSCE States.\r\nEurope was then liberating itself from the legacy of the\r\npast. The dawning of this time of promise, however, was\r\nsoon to be clouded by instability and insecurity.When the\r\nCSCE Heads of State or Government met in July 1992 at the\r\nHelsinki Summit, they acknowledged that economic decline,\r\nsocial tension, aggressive nationalism, intolerance,\r\nxenophobia and ethnic conflicts were threatening stability in\r\nthe CSCE area.\r\nThe Helsinki Summit registered yet another reality\r\nwhich had developed since the adoption of the Charter of\r\nParis. In its Summit Declaration it stated:\r\n\"For the first time in decades we are facing\r\nwarfare in the CSCE region. New armed conflicts and\r\nmassive use of force to achieve hegemony and\r\nterritorial expansion continue to occur. The loss of life,\r\nhuman misery, involving huge numbers of refugees\r\nhave been the worst since the Second World War.\r\nDamage to our cultural heritage and the destruction of\r\nproperty have been appalling.\" (A/47/361, annex,\r\npara. 13)\r\nThe challenge of change has brought with it a need to\r\nexamine and assess our international efforts to build a new\r\nworld order. In acknowledging and respecting the distinct\r\ncontribution of the various international forums and\r\norganizations towards building peace in our time, we cannot\r\nbut continue to explore and consolidate those avenues which\r\nfoster closer cooperation in preventing and settling conflicts.\r\nIt is within this context that the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe must be viewed.\r\nMalta is particularly honoured to have actively\r\ncontributed to formalizing such cooperation. The idea of\r\nhaving the CSCE declare itself a regional arrangement in\r\nterms of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nwas explored within this building while the Deputy Prime\r\nMinis ter and Foreign Minis ter of Malta ,\r\nMr. Guido de Marco, was presiding over the forty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, and was later proposed for\r\n56th meeting - Tuesday, 16 November l993 15\r\nthe consideration of the meeting of the CSCE Council of\r\nMinisters in Prague early last year. During the Helsinki\r\nFollow-Up Meeting, Malta was foremost among those who\r\nproposed and promoted this declaration and submitted the\r\nproposal for its adoption.\r\nDuring this past year, thanks to the commitment of the\r\nForeign Minister of Sweden, who, as Chairman-in-Office of\r\nthe CSCE, devoted great energy to giving this declaration\r\nconcrete form, we have witnessed agreement on the\r\n\"Framework for cooperation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat and the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe\", signed on 26 May 1993. This\r\ncooperation is still in its initial phases, but even at such an\r\nearly stage it has been put to the test in those zones of\r\nconflict which threaten stability in the CSCE region.\r\nThe understanding that the CSCE is a regional\r\narrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations provides an important link between\r\nEuropean and global security.\r\nExperience throughout the past year has shown that\r\nresults do not necessarily match efforts in conflict prevention\r\nand peace-building. That is why a greater effort is required\r\nto consolidate cooperation not only in areas which are\r\nimmediately connected with security, but even in others\r\nwhich may be the root causes of future tensions, including\r\nareas of cooperation in the human dimension and economic\r\ncooperation.\r\nThat is why my delegation continues to regard the\r\ndiscussion of this item as extremely important, and it is in\r\nthis spirit that my delegation supports the draft resolution on\r\nthis subject which has been submitted by the representative\r\nof Sweden and which, together with other members of the\r\nCSCE, we are most happy to co-sponsor.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nMr. MALONE (Canada): The draft resolution we are\r\nconsidering today addresses the enhancement of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), a regional arrangement\r\nin the sense of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter.\r\nOn 26 May of this year, the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE\r\nexchanged letters signalling their acceptance of a framework\r\nfor United Nations-CSCE cooperation. This framework\r\nprovides an excellent basis on which to build mutual\r\ncooperation in a variety of areas, particularly in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security and promoting respect for\r\nhuman rights in the CSCE area.\r\nIndeed, such cooperation is already occurring where it\r\ncounts most: on the ground. In former Yugoslavia, Georgia,\r\nNagorny Karabakh, Tajikistan and Moldova, the United\r\nNations and the CSCE are cooperating and coordinating in\r\neffective ways to build peace and security. In Canada’s\r\nview, such cooperation and complementarity of activity is\r\nabsolutely essential to conflict-management efforts.\r\nWithin the CSCE, Canada has concentrated on\r\ndeveloping the means for effective conflict management by\r\nestablishing a range of instruments from fact-finding and\r\ngood offices to mediation and preventive diplomacy.\r\nCanada pioneered the idea of CSCE peace-keeping as a\r\nnecessary element in the spectrum of CSCE conflict-\r\nmanagement instruments. We have sought, with other CSCE\r\npartners, to strengthen commitments in areas such as\r\nminorities, tolerance and democratic development. We\r\nbelieve our approach to conflict management within the\r\nCSCE complements the type of proposals outlined in the\r\n\"Agenda for Peace\".\r\nThe relationship the CSCE enjoys with the United\r\nNations is among the most advanced of any regional\r\norganization and, I would add, could serve as a useful model\r\nfor other organizations and regions. Both organizations will\r\nbenefit from cooperation and coordination in tangible ways.\r\nFor the United Nations, strengthening the capacity of\r\nregional organizations to promote regional and global\r\nsecurity is one of the key objectives outlined in the\r\n\"Agenda for Peace\". A more important role for regional\r\norganizations in peace and security will free up time and\r\nresources for the United Nations, allowing it to concentrate\r\non those situations where only the United Nations with its\r\nglobal political legitimacy, well-developed infrastructure and\r\nresources - can make an impact.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nFor the CSCE, closer cooperation and coordination with\r\nthe United Nations will strengthen the CSCE’s own\r\ncapabilities in areas as diverse as early warning, conflict\r\nprevention and crisis management, including fact-finding,\r\npreventive diplomacy and peace-keeping. It will also ensure\r\nthat global political pressure - which only the United Nations\r\ncan marshal - is brought to bear if and when it is needed in\r\nsupport of CSCE efforts.\r\nEnhanced cooperation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE will also make it possible to\r\nreduce duplication of effort and to improve effectiveness.\r\nThis is an era of reduced resources and increased demands\r\non such resources. There must therefore be an effective\r\ndivision of labour between the United Nations and the CSCE\r\nwhen they are active in the same field.\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nTo improve communications, there must be more\r\ncontacts. The CSCE has invited a representative of the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations to attend meetings\r\nof the CSCE Committee of Senior Officials and of the\r\nCSCE Council. Some organs of the United Nations\r\nregularly participate in CSCE meetings that deal with their\r\nareas of competence. In this respect, we are pleased that the\r\nUnited Nations, in resolution 48/5, has granted the CSCE\r\nobserver status in the General Assembly.\r\nIn order to further the mutual goals of the United\r\nNations and the CSCE in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity, we fully endorse the draft resolution that we have\r\nco-sponsored and that has been presented to the General\r\nAssembly by Sweden, in its capacity as Chairman-in-Office\r\nof the CSCE, on behalf of all the States participating in the\r\nCSCE.\r\nMr. ERDÖS (Hungary) (interpretation from French):\r\nHungary welcomes the consideration of this item on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Conference\r\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), as events\r\nshow that this cooperation is becoming increasingly\r\nimportant. The activities and achievements of the CSCE,\r\nwhich will soon be marking the twentieth anniversary of the\r\nHelsinki Final Act - the first basic document of this process -\r\nare too well known to Members of the United Nations for\r\nme to dwell on them now. However, we wish to highlight\r\ntwo elements to which we attach particular importance.\r\nFirst, during the cold war, the CSCE was virtually the\r\nonly general forum for dialogue between East and West and\r\nit played a decisive role in the dismantling of the closed\r\nsocieties of Eastern Europe and in launching the process of\r\nreconciliation with the ideals of political and economic\r\nfreedoms. Second, it is fitting to recall that, even at a time\r\nwhen Europe was politically and physically divided and a\r\nprey to an unprecedented ideological and military\r\nconfrontation, the CSCE was able to provide a forum for\r\ncomprehensive negotiation and cooperation which even\r\ntoday, because of its effectiveness and its infrastructure, can\r\nserve as a model to other regions in the world. Although the\r\nsituation today is fundamentally different, it is important for\r\nus to recognize, in retrospect, the historic merits of the\r\nHelsinki process.\r\nThe CSCE is still a unique organization, including as it\r\ndoes all the countries of North America and Europe and all\r\nthe former Republics of the former USSR, and thus bringing\r\ntogether, on the basis of its declared principles of the rule of\r\nlaw and democracy, a vast region extending from Vancouver\r\nto Vladivostok. The scope of CSCE activities is just as\r\nbroad as its geographical dimension. They include all the\r\nfactors involving security in all its dimensions. They range\r\nfrom military security to humanitarian and cultural\r\ncooperation. It also involves political principles governing\r\nrelations between the participating countries, as well as\r\nmatters concerning economic relations and protection of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nAccording to the 1992 Helsinki Summit declaration, the\r\nCSCE is a regional arrangement under Chapter VIII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. As such, it provides an important\r\nlink between European security and global security and\r\nopens up new horizons for cooperation between the two\r\norganizations. The granting of Observer status to the CSCE\r\nby the General Assembly in October is certainly a significant\r\nstep in this direction.\r\nToday, the CSCE faces new challenges. It must seek\r\nits new identity by adapting to the changes that have\r\noccurred. Hungary highly values the CSCE activities aimed\r\nat averting and dealing with conflicts in the region and in\r\npromoting and consolidating human rights and the principles\r\nof the democratic system. Today’s challenges include, in\r\nparticular, flagrant violations of principles governing inter-\r\nState relations between CSCE countries, ethnic conflict,\r\nmass violations of human rights, including the rights of\r\nminorities, problems relating to nationalisms of all kinds,\r\nintolerance and xenophobia. The CSCE continues to deal\r\nwith these issues and seeks to find the most appropriate\r\nways of coping with these disturbing phenomena. Here we\r\nattach particular importance to the establishment 18 months\r\nago of a CSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities.\r\nThat decision clearly reflects the relationship between the\r\nrights of minorities and the maintenance of regional security.\r\nIt is undeniable that the way these rights are dealt with has\r\na decisive influence not only on stability in the CSCE region\r\nbut also on international peace and security. Unfortunately,\r\nthe litany of ethnic tension and conflicts in our region and\r\ntheir impact on the world situation only strengthens the\r\nvalidity of this statement.\r\nRecently, cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe CSCE has become a tangible reality in many conflict\r\nsituations. In the former Yugoslavia, one can mention the\r\nlong-term missions in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina -\r\nmissions which, until the recent refusal to extend their\r\nmandate, were a concrete manifestation of the CSCE’s\r\npreventive diplomacy. Given the continuing crisis in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, we think it extremely important that\r\nthese CSCE missions resume their activities as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nWe also welcome the assistance given by the countries\r\nof the European Union, through the CSCE, to the\r\nneighbouring States of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\n(Serbia and Montenegro) in implementation of the sanctions\r\nimposed on that country by the Security Council. Missions\r\nto provide assistance in the implementation of the sanctions\r\n56th meeting - Tuesday, 16 November l993 17\r\nrepresent a significant contribution to enhancing the\r\neffectiveness of the sanctions regime.\r\nThe situations in Nagorny Karabakh, the Republic of\r\nMoldova, Georgia and Tajikistan, provide other examples of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE. Of\r\ncourse, we have to determine the nature of such cooperation\r\ndepending on the characteristics of the various situations. In\r\nso doing, some difficulties in coordination are sometimes\r\ninevitable, but they can be easily overcome if there is\r\npolitical will on all sides and if there is a willingness to act\r\ntogether in pursuing the same goals.\r\nWe advocate broader cooperation between the two\r\norganizations and the enhancement of its cooperation in all\r\nareas of common interest. In the practical division of tasks\r\nbetween the United Nations and the CSCE, it is important to\r\navoid duplication and to emphasize the complementarity of\r\ntheir activities. We believe that the problems of cooperation\r\nand coordination must be dealt with in a flexible and\r\npragmatic manner - not by using strict and rigid criteria -\r\nand on the basis of a specific analysis of a given situation.\r\nAccordingly, we fully support the strengthening of\r\ncooperation between these two organizations, and this is\r\nreflected in our sponsorship of the draft resolution contained\r\nin document A/48/L.18. We are confident that it will be\r\nadopted by the General Assembly.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/5 of 13 October 1993, I now call on\r\nMr. Wilhelm Höynck, Secretary-General of the Conference\r\non Security and Cooperation in Europe.\r\nMr. HÖYNCK (Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE)): It is a great pleasure and\r\nindeed an honour for the Secretary-General of the CSCE to\r\naddress the General Assembly on the issue of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the CSCE. I greatly\r\nappreciate the friendly reception I have been accorded in this\r\naugust body by the preceding speakers.\r\nThe Assembly’s discussion today, the granting of\r\nObserver status to the CSCE, the formal establishment of a\r\nframework for cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe CSCE - all this serves one purpose: to firmly establish\r\nand to improve mutually reinforcing cooperation.\r\nAs a regional arrangement under Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, the CSCE wants to make a\r\ncontribution to the implementation of United Nations policy\r\nconcepts. They have been outlined in \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\", prepared by the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. His report stresses that\r\n\"regional arrangements or agencies in many cases\r\npossess a potential that should be utilized in serving the\r\nfunctions [of] preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping,\r\npeacemaking and post-conflict peace-building.\"\r\n(A/47/277, para. 64)\r\nOne of the advantages of such regional action is that it can\r\nconsiderably lighten the heavy burden of the United Nations\r\nand in particular of the Security Council. This was the\r\nintention of the founding fathers and mothers of the United\r\nNations. They laid down in Article 52 of the Charter that\r\nthe Members of the United Nations participating in such\r\nregional arrangements\r\n\"shall make every effort to achieve pacific settlement of\r\nlocal disputes through such regional arrangements ...\r\nbefore referring them to the Security Council.\"\r\nThe CSCE was launched more than 20 years ago with\r\nthe Helsinki Final Act of 1975 as its founding political\r\nconstitution. But the fundamental changes in the geopolitical\r\nenvironment within the CSCE area at the turn of the last\r\ndecade also led to a dramatic transformation of the CSCE\r\nmission and profile. It became a vehicle for managing this\r\nhistorical change, with new tasks and new activities in the\r\nwide CSCE area from Vancouver to Vladivostok.\r\nThe new CSCE is based on a comprehensive concept of\r\nsecurity. It closely relates the maintenance of peace with\r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It links\r\neconomic and environmental solidarity and cooperation with\r\npeaceful inter-State relations. This is the time for exploring\r\nall opportunities for new cooperative approaches to\r\nstrengthening security. Now we must revitalize and\r\nconsolidate the principle of indivisible security in the CSCE\r\narea.\r\nThe human dimension - that is, human rights,\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law - is the centre of the CSCE.\r\nNorms and commitments in this field have been elevated to\r\nunparalleled high levels. They are politically binding, and\r\nadherence is monitored in a cooperative system. When\r\nhuman-dimension implementation gives rise to concern, a\r\nvariety of CSCE mechanisms is available, including fact-\r\nfinding and rapporteur missions.\r\nAt the Moscow Human Dimension Meeting of the\r\nCSCE in September 1991 the participating States declared\r\ncategorically and irrevocably that the commitments\r\nundertaken in the field of the human dimension\r\n\"are matters of direct and legitimate concern to all\r\nparticipating States and do not belong exclusively to the\r\ninternal affairs of the State concerned\".\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThis breakthrough levelled the traditionally almost\r\ninsurmountable walls of national sovereignty. In the\r\ninterests of peace and stability, it opened the way for CSCE\r\ninvolvement at an early stage not only in external conflicts,\r\nbut also in internal conflicts related to human-dimension\r\nissues.\r\nFull integration of the human dimension into the\r\nbroader range of conflict-prevention instruments is one of\r\nthe priority tasks of the new CSCE. On this basis, the\r\nCSCE tries to face the formidable challenges of ongoing\r\nwars, ethnic tensions and overall lack of progress towards\r\nnew stability in the CSCE area. Under the dynamic\r\nguidance of the Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE, the\r\nSwedish Foreign Minister, Baroness Margarethe af Ugglas,\r\nnew impulse has been given to CSCE operations,\r\nconsultations and negotiations.\r\nCSCE operations have extended considerably. Concrete\r\nand practical contributions to conflict prevention and, in\r\nsome cases, crisis management have been made by the\r\ngrowing number of CSCE missions in the field, by the\r\nexpanding activities of the CSCE Office for Democratic\r\nInstitutions and Human Rights and by the CSCE High\r\nCommissioner on National Minorities. The overall number\r\nof CSCE missions operative this year has been eight. Some\r\nwere mainly conflict prevention; others in the first place\r\ncrisis management missions. These small-scale missions are\r\ndeployed in the Balkans, the Baltic and the Caucasus area.\r\nAll the missions contributed in varying degrees to stabilizing\r\nthe respective situations.\r\nIt is deeply regrettable - as preceding speakers have\r\nalready said - that the CSCE missions to Kosovo, Sandjak\r\nand Vojvodina in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia\r\nand Montenegro) could not continue their very useful\r\npresence and work in the area because the authorities in\r\nBelgrade did not extend the Memorandum of Understanding\r\nconstituting the working basis of these missions. With the\r\nsolid backing of the international community it should be\r\npossible to achieve a review of this uncooperative decision.\r\nThe CSCE is, like the United Nations, faced with the\r\nproblem that the mandates of its missions continue to have\r\nto be extended because further time is needed to achieve\r\nsatisfactory results. While we realize that, for conflict\r\nprevention and crisis management by peaceful means,\r\npatience is of the essence, regular and careful review of the\r\nsituation is undertaken in order to insure that all parties to\r\nthe conflict continue to be cooperative. It has to be\r\nunderlined again and again that the conflicting parties cannot\r\nexpect the missions to solve their problems, but that they\r\nthemselves have to engage in a quest for settlement.\r\nSince the beginning of 1992 the CSCE has been\r\nincreasingly involved in the conflict in and around Nagorny\r\nKarabakh. With the repeated explicit support of the United\r\nNations Security Council, the so-called Minsk Group\r\ncountries of the CSCE have tried to move with the\r\nconflicting parties towards a solid framework for negotiating\r\na solution. This framework must include a holding cease-\r\nfire that might be observed by about 500 CSCE monitors.\r\nIt is the common understanding of all CSCE\r\nparticipating States, laid down in the decisions of the\r\nHelsinki Summit 1992, that CSCE peace-keeping operations\r\nwill not entail enforcement action. This is one of the\r\ncompelling reasons for close cooperation and coordination\r\nbetween the CSCE and the United Nations, because the\r\ncontinuity of crisis management must be ensured if the\r\napplication of peaceful means proves to be ineffective.\r\nAs all crisis settlement efforts are becoming\r\nincreasingly difficult while the civilian population is exposed\r\nto unbearable suffering, the CSCE tries to improve its\r\npotential for conflict prevention. The first CSCE High\r\nC o m m i s s i o n e r o n N a t i o n a l M i n o r i t i e s ,\r\nMr. Max van der Stoel of the Netherlands, took office in\r\nJanuary 1993. He has the task of providing early warning\r\nand, as appropriate, early action at the earliest possible stage\r\nin regard to tensions involving national minority issues. In\r\nthis framework, the High Commissioner has become active\r\nin a great number of States, particularly in the Baltic and in\r\nthe Balkans. The very positive response to his intensive\r\nactivity in his first year of office showed that flexible,\r\ndiscreet and authoritative advice based on broad international\r\nsupport is one of the promising answers to our new\r\nchallenges.\r\nDuring the past year CSCE consultations have also\r\nachieved a new dimension. These consultations on all issues\r\npertinent to the CSCE have centred around the conflicts with\r\nwhich the CSCE is seized. In addition, and as an important\r\nelement of the development of a cooperative security\r\nstructure, participating States can raise and are raising\r\nparticular political and security concerns.\r\nCSCE negotiations focused on measures of disarmament\r\nand confidence- and security-building. In the CSCE area the\r\nold threats of all-out military confrontation are gone. But\r\nlarge military potentials remain, while the area is facing new\r\nchallenges. Furthermore, there is a risk of fragmentation of\r\nEuropean security. The immediate concern is localized,\r\ntypically small-scale resort to force. The CSCE is\r\ndeveloping new arrangements the better to respond to these\r\nchallenges and to counter the abuse of force externally and\r\ninternally. Decisions on transparency of defence planning,\r\nstabilizing measures for localized crisis situations and\r\nprinciples of arms transfers and military contacts are now\r\n56th meeting - Tuesday, 16 November l993 19\r\nunder preparation. The new code of conduct governing\r\nrelations between States with regard to security-related\r\nmatters is being negotiated. That would be a landmark\r\ncontribution to cooperative security approaches.\r\nThis selection of CSCE activities underlines the\r\ncomplementarity of CSCE and United Nations action. The\r\nCSCE has a deep and sincere interest in mutually reinforcing\r\ncooperation with the United Nations as well as with other\r\nregional organizations. Each should preserve its own area of\r\naction and responsibility. We have to look for a constructive\r\ndivision of labour on the basis of comparative advantages.\r\nSince our means will hardly suffice to meet all challenges,\r\nwe cannot permit duplication of efforts.\r\nThe many positive comments and the substantial\r\nproposals made here today are really encouraging. I\r\nappreciate the prospect of the adoption of draft resolution\r\nA/48/L.18, with its impressive list of sponsors. We all know\r\nthat there is still room for deepening coordination and\r\ncooperation between the CSCE and the United Nations. I\r\nam fully confident that we will make progress. This will\r\nincrease the potential available for solving the challenges\r\nthat we are facing. There is no other choice. Only a multi-\r\ninstitutional structure can maintain the will and provide the\r\nmeans necessary to reach our common aim - a lasting and\r\npeaceful order in the CSCE area.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Before taking action on the draft\r\nresolution, I should like to announce that the following\r\ncountries have become sponsors of draft resolution\r\nA/48/L.18: Belarus, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Iceland,\r\nLuxembourg, Poland and The Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.18.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/48/L.18 was adopted (resolution\r\n48/19).\r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I also take it that it is the\r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 26?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 151 (continued)\r\nUNITED NATIONS INITIATIVE ON OPPORTUNITY\r\nAND PARTICIPATION: DRAFT RESOLUTION\r\n(A/48/L.19)\r\nMr. KOROMA (Sierra Leone): The Sierra Leone\r\ndelegation attaches importance to the timely initiative on\r\nopportunity and participation formulated and proposed by the\r\nGovernment of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea.\r\nThese concepts of opportunity and participation are not\r\nonly eternal verities but remain essential prerequisites for the\r\nsocio-economic development of the developing countries.\r\nThe importance of the proposal further lies in the fact that\r\nboth concepts are for the first time being addressed together\r\nin this forum to highlight the imbalances that characterize\r\nparticularly the economic activities in many of our\r\ndeveloping countries, where the vast majority are given or\r\noffered a dismal fraction of the requisite opportunities to\r\nenable them to participate effectively in the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of their respective countries.\r\nIndeed, mineral as well as other natural resources in our\r\ncountries have to be mined or exploited to provide much-\r\nneeded revenue and foreign exchange for the use of\r\nGovernments, but a cause for regret is the continuing dearth\r\nof adequate educational and other meaningful opportunities\r\nand facilities to enable the indigenous people to acquire not\r\nonly the opportunity but also the experience needed to hold\r\nmeaningful positions that will enable them to participate\r\neffectively in the overall economic development of their\r\nrespective countries. In short, there is an urgent need for an\r\nincrease in the opportunities that are open to nationals of our\r\ncountries to serve as floodgates for meaningful participation\r\nin the ongoing and future economic-development projects\r\nand ventures in many of our countries.\r\nThe Sierra Leone delegation also welcomes the decision\r\nof the Government of Papua New Guinea to submit what we\r\nconsider to be a well-thought-out proposal to have an ad hoc\r\npanel of distinguished experts and experienced persons\r\nbroadly representative of the international community\r\nappointed as the \"United Nations Panel on Opportunity and\r\nParticipation\" to conduct a comprehensive, systematic and\r\nthorough study of opportunity and participation, with\r\nparticular reference to the economies of the developing\r\ncountries, with the objective of finding practical options for\r\nincreasing and maximizing opportunity and participation in\r\nthe economies of developing countries. It is expected that\r\nthat panel will review relevant areas of public policy, the\r\nlegal system, administration, economics, finance and\r\nbanking, and will assess the contributions which\r\nGovernments, the private sectors and non-governmental\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\norganizations can make in linking opportunity to\r\nparticipation.\r\nThe appropriate nature and timeliness of the Papua New\r\nGuinea initiative for most developing countries cannot be\r\noveremphasized. The unhealthy nature of the economies of\r\nmany developing countries, the reduction of flows of official\r\ndevelopment assistance and the increasing competition for\r\nforeign aid, investments and loans are additional reasons to\r\nundertake a study that will focus attention on and identify\r\nthe underlying causes of the poor performance of the\r\neconomies and other development aspects of many\r\ndeveloping countries and to emerge with recommendations -\r\nincluding hard work, of course - as to how to overcome our\r\npoor economic performance and underdevelopment.\r\nSecondly, there is the time-frame within which the\r\npanel should commence and complete its work and its\r\nmandate. Unlike other proposals before the United Nations\r\nthat do not have any stated dates for the beginning and\r\ncompletion of their implementation, the proposal under\r\nconsideration specifies January 1994 as the date on which\r\nthe panel should commence its work, and the report should\r\nbe submitted for consideration by the time of the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, in 1995. In addition, in\r\nthe draft resolution the Secretary-General is requested to\r\nsubmit a progress report on the work of the panel to the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session next year. This,\r\nwe believe, underlines the urgency of the situation and what\r\nis expected of the panel that will be so constituted.\r\nThe Sierra Leone delegation is persuaded that this\r\ninitiative will not further burden the resources of the\r\nOrganization in as much as resources for its implementation\r\nwill be sought from voluntary contributions from Member\r\nStates and other international organizations. This initiative\r\nshould not only complement the proposed new agenda for\r\ndevelopment which is under preparation by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral but should catalyses the implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s and the Programme of Action for the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries for the 1990s and should act as a\r\nfurther commitment to the full implementation of\r\nAgenda 21. The recommendations presented by the panel,\r\nwhich it is proposed to establish, should also include a\r\ndefinition and elaboration of what opportunities for\r\nparticipation should entail in the context of the forthcoming\r\nUnited Nations World Summit for Social Development and\r\nthe Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States.\r\nFinally, the proposal deserves the support of every\r\ndelegation at the United Nations because it is, above all,\r\npeople-oriented. It underscores the mobilization of people\r\nand resources, on the basis of an awareness of the actual\r\ncircumstances in which people, particularly rural villagers,\r\nwomen and other disadvantaged groups, spend their lives.\r\nMy delegation therefore fully supports the proposal and\r\ncommends the draft resolution for adoption.\r\nMrs. JAGAN (Guyana): In this post-cold-war era the\r\nUnited Nations is both challenged and stimulated by the\r\nopportunities afforded it to transform the adverse conditions\r\nunder which so many of the world’s inhabitants labour.\r\nThe challenges range from the more recent\r\npreoccupation with peace-keeping, peacemaking and\r\npreventive diplomacy, to the traditional tasks of facilitating\r\nand promoting social and economic development and the\r\nsafeguarding of both sovereign and individual rights,\r\nincluding the right to development and the equitable\r\nparticipation of all in the benefits of that process.\r\nThe opportunities are similarly multifaceted. The\r\nprevailing environment in which the world is no longer\r\nconstrained by the forces of ideological polarity presents us\r\nwith an unprecedented opportunity to effect ready solutions\r\nto the very challenges which confront us as a world\r\ncommunity. It is a chance to extend ourselves, to allow for\r\na greater involvement by all nations in a concerted attempt\r\nto remedy the problems of the world.\r\nThe item on which the Assembly is now focused speaks\r\nof a United Nations initiative on opportunity and\r\nparticipation. The main theme of this subject is the issue of\r\ndevelopment. This item brings a new perspective to the\r\ndevelopment debate at a time when a fresh viewpoint is\r\nbadly needed. After all these years, is it not time to focus\r\non practical ways of enhancing international cooperation so\r\nthat attention can truly focus on the means of\r\nimplementation? Developing countries are not helped by\r\ndeclarations which restate old platitudes without a concurrent\r\ncommitment of political will and resources. It is a sad, but\r\nI fear accurate, statement that our countries are further away\r\nfrom the goal of attaining a better life for their peoples than\r\nthey were when we first began this dialogue in the\r\ninternational arena some 30 years ago.\r\nIt is indicative of the measure of importance that the\r\nmembership of the Organization attaches to the issue of\r\ndevelopment, and to the role of the United Nations in\r\nachieving it, that we at this particular juncture are dealing\r\nwith so many aspects pertinent to its global attainment.\r\nMany representatives speaking at the current session, as well\r\nas at the last session, have called for the launching of an\r\nagenda for development, on which we eagerly await the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General.\r\n56th meeting - Tuesday, 16 November l993 21\r\nIt is not by coincidence that both the Movement of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries and the Group of 77 have endorsed\r\nan initiative for the reactivation of the North-South dialogue.\r\nMeanwhile we continue to deliberate on the implementation\r\nof Agenda 21 and the sustainable development of small\r\nisland and low-lying coastal States; on the situation\r\nconcerning least developed and land-locked countries; and\r\non the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s, to cite but a few of our developmental preoccupations\r\nin this body.\r\nWhether one speaks of opportunity and participation in\r\nthe economic and social process at the national level, in the\r\ncontext of activities of the United Nations, or in relation to\r\nthe role and activities of the private sector, a common thread\r\nis the development goal that is the object of consideration.\r\nThe attainment of the goal of economic and social\r\ndevelopment is of paramount importance for our countries.\r\nSuch development must be balanced and sustainable. It\r\nmust take account of our physical and cultural heritage and\r\ndiversity. It must also take account of the requirement for\r\nbequeathing this heritage to future generations. It must\r\nensure the rational development of all our resources, both\r\nhuman and material.\r\nThe developmental process in which we are engaged\r\nmust be equitable. It must meet the needs and requirements\r\nof every group in our society at the national level, and of\r\ncountries large and small at the global level. The equitable\r\ndistribution of resources and the opportunity for all to share\r\nin their benefits are critical elements in the development\r\nchallenge with which we are faced.\r\nThe Guyana delegation is of the view that we must\r\ntherefore respond to this challenge in a rational way. The\r\ntime has come for us to bring together the various\r\napproaches to a possible solution in a single, common\r\nagenda. The opportunity for concerted action to address the\r\ndevelopment imperative rests with this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We wish to commend the Government\r\nof Papua New Guinea for this laudable initiative and we\r\ninvite the Assembly to collaborate in charting the way\r\nforward.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
