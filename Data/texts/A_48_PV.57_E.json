"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n57th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nWednesday, 17 November 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 151 (continued)\r\nUNITED NATIONS INITIATIVE ON OPPORTUNITY\r\nAND PARTICIPATION: DRAFT RESOLUTION\r\n(A/48/L.19)\r\nMrs. SELMANE (Algeria) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): We listened carefully to the statement made by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Papua New Guinea. His\r\npresentation gives a picture of all the efforts already\r\nundertaken to prepare and develop the initiative with a view\r\nto the establishment of a \"United Nations Panel on\r\nOpportunity and Participation\".\r\nAt a time when our Organization is tackling the\r\npreparation of an agenda for development and working to\r\nmake its fiftieth anniversary the target date for concluding a\r\nprocess of renewal and of adaptation to the new challenges\r\nfacing mankind, this initiative is certainly timely and\r\nimportant.\r\nThe especially difficult economic situation of the\r\ndeveloping countries, exacerbated by an unfavourable\r\ninternational environment, underscores the importance of the\r\nlink between peace and development in today’s world. The\r\nconcept of development has itself become especially\r\ncomplex, and there is an ever-growing awareness of the need\r\nto integrate fully the elements of sustainability and human\r\nsecurity; hence, the timeliness and the high stakes attached\r\nto the field of investigation proposed for the United Nations\r\nPanel on Opportunity and Participation. The Panel’s\r\nindependence and the competence of its members are such\r\nas to imbue its analyses and recommendations with the\r\nrelevance, originality and boldness needed for it to have a\r\nsalutary impact as we approach the fiftieth anniversary.\r\nThe Algerian delegation therefore wishes to reaffirm its\r\nsupport for this initiative, and it fully supports the draft\r\nresolution (A/48/L.19) that defines its objectives and\r\nmodalities.\r\nMr. McKINNON (New Zealand): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I would like to extend our thanks and\r\nappreciation to the Honourable John Kaputin, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Papua New Guinea, for his opening of the\r\ndebate on this item and for his introduction of the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/48/L.19.\r\nThe United Nations Initiative on Opportunity and\r\nParticipation was considered at the South Pacific Forum\r\nmeeting in Nauru in August this year. The Heads of\r\nGovernment of Pacific States gave their support to the\r\nproposal at that meeting, and Forum members were\r\nencouraged to support it at this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe believe that the further examination of this issue\r\nmay help our understanding as we move to shape a new\r\nagenda for development in the 1990s.\r\nSustainable human development is now identified as the\r\ncrucial target for our age. A key ingredient in that concept\r\nis the ability of people, as individuals or as groups, to\r\nparticipate fully and effectively in the economic, social,\r\ncultural and political processes that affect their lives. We\r\nnow recognize that development which does not deal with\r\nthis dimension is seriously flawed. For development to be\r\nequitable and sustainable it must reach out and encompass\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-87207 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.57\r\n29 November 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November 1993\r\nall of society, not just those individuals and groups who\r\nhappen to be historically well positioned to benefit from\r\ndevelopment. The link between economic and social\r\ndevelopment and peace and stability is now well established.\r\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea and the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Papua New Guinea, the\r\nHonourable John Kaputin, are performing a very valuable\r\nservice in bringing to our attention the fact that rapid\r\neconomic growth can misfire if we do not provide\r\nopportunities for participation by and benefit to individuals\r\nthroughout society. The draft resolution before us represents\r\nan endeavour to advance the process of identifying and\r\nremedying the barriers to opportunity and to participation\r\nthat clearly do exist in many countries.\r\nThere is much fruitful work that can be drawn on by\r\nthe panel proposed in the draft resolution. In particular, the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has\r\nfocused attention on this very issue in the 1993 Human\r\nDevelopment Report and again last week in a very thought-\r\nprovoking statement made by the new Administrator of\r\nUNDP, Gus Speth, to the Second Committee. We would\r\nencourage the panel to work closely with UNDP in the\r\nexecution of its mandate, amongst the other avenues it will\r\nexplore.\r\nGiven the potential range of issues relevant to\r\nopportunity and participation, my delegation believes it is\r\nimportant that the panel’s work be carefully delimited and\r\nwell focused. The panel will need to determine specific\r\ndirections in which it wishes its work to proceed.\r\nThe theme of people’s participation is receiving\r\nattention in a number of United Nations forums, for example\r\nin the elaboration of an agenda for development, which will\r\ncomplement the \"Agenda for Peace\", and also in\r\npreparations for the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, the Fourth World Conference on Women\r\nand the World Summit for Social Development. The\r\ninitiative of examination, by the panel, of the issues of\r\nopportunity and participation is therefore timely across a\r\nbroad spectrum of United Nations activities. The panel’s\r\nreports to the General Assembly should provide a valuable\r\ninput to these broader discussions under way in the United\r\nNations.\r\nI think we all agree that impulses for participation\r\nshould be better understood and nurtured. We therefore look\r\nto the proposed panel to advance this process.\r\nMr. NYAKYI (United Republic of Tanzania): My\r\ndelegation joins previous speakers in congratulating the\r\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea for the proposal on the\r\nUnited Nations initiative on opportunity and participation\r\nand warmly welcomes the stimulating statement with which\r\nthe Honourable John Kaputin, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Papua New Guinea, opened the debate on this initiative.\r\nAs prerequisites for human development, opportunity\r\nand participation are so self-evident that we tend to take\r\nthem for granted. In any social system people have to\r\npursue their aspirations for development, and opportunity\r\nand participation are necessary for their advancement.\r\nNecessary as it is for human development, the spirit of\r\ninitiative and enterprise is inadequate if unaccompanied by\r\nopportunity and participation. My delegation believes that\r\nthis has been the experience of many countries, particularly\r\ndeveloping countries, in the last several years. An important\r\nobjective of the reforms undertaken by many countries\r\naround the world, especially developing countries, has been\r\nto provide opportunity and participation for their citizens.\r\nIn the case of my own country, Tanzania, we learned\r\nvery early on that while nothing can replace one’s own\r\nefforts for economic and social advancement, supportive\r\nintervention from the outside has a critical role to play in the\r\nprocess of development. That role essentially involves\r\nmaking available to citizens the opportunity to develop\r\nthemselves and to participate in making the decisions that\r\naffect their lives.\r\nEach of our countries has had its own experience. The\r\nPapua New Guinea initiative provides us with a very\r\nwelcome opportunity to share these experiences and to reach\r\na common understanding on ways and means of enlarging\r\nthe opportunity and participation of our citizens in their own\r\nadvancement and in that of their countries.\r\nSince the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly, when the idea was first presented, we have had\r\na number of opportunities to discuss the proposal and to\r\nassess its contribution to the evident and urgent need to\r\nincrease the opportunity and participation, not only of\r\ncitizens in the local economy as stated earlier, but also of\r\ndeveloping countries in the global economy. At both the\r\nnational and the international level, opportunity and\r\nparticipation are required for development. Unfortunately,\r\nat the international level the concept of opportunity and\r\nparticipation has not been fully accepted. That is why the\r\ncall for an agenda for development is very timely. As we\r\nawait the Secretary-General’s report on this subject, the\r\nproposal by the Government of Papua New Guinea gives us\r\na welcome opportunity to initiate a discussion which can\r\nonly enrich the debate on this important item.\r\nThe fact that reform efforts in the developing countries\r\nto foster growth and development continue to be frustrated\r\nby the persistent inequalities in international economic\r\nrelations constitutes a serious obstacle to the establishment\r\n57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November l993 3\r\nof global partnership and to the realities of interdependence\r\nin the world today. The proposal on opportunity and\r\nparticipation is both timely and urgent, as it allows us to\r\nexamine past failures in our attempts to build a just and\r\nequitable international system and to chart new and\r\ninnovative strategies for sustainable development. We have\r\nattended several international conferences focused on\r\ndifferent aspects and dimensions of human cooperation and\r\ndevelopment in an attempt to seek solutions to growing\r\ninequalities in the global economy.\r\nThe proposal by Papua New Guinea rightly points out\r\nthat even after several decades of United Nations resolutions,\r\nexpert studies, special international conferences, including\r\nthe North-South dialogue and plans of action, many\r\ndeveloping countries are experiencing static or declining\r\nrates of economic growth, while many of the most serious\r\nand widespread difficulties experienced in securing\r\nopportunities for economic participation by individuals,\r\ngroups and firms in developing countries remain largely\r\nunaddressed.\r\nThe United Nations International Development Strategy\r\nfor the Fourth United Nations Development Decade lists six\r\ngoals for the achievement of its aims:\r\n\"(a) A surge in the pace of economic growth in\r\nthe developing countries;\r\n(b) A development process that is responsive to\r\nsocial needs, seeks a significant reduction in extreme\r\npoverty, promotes the development and utilization of\r\nhuman resources and skills and is environmentally\r\nsound and sustainable;\r\n(c) An improvement of the international systems\r\nof money, finance and trade so as to support the\r\ndevelopment process;\r\n(d) A setting of strength and stability in the world\r\neconomy and sound macro-economic management,\r\nnationally and internationally;\r\n(e) A decisive strengthening of international\r\ndevelopment cooperation;\r\n(f) A special effort to deal with the problems of\r\nthe least developed countries, the weakest among the\r\ndeveloping countries.\" (resolution 45/199, annex,\r\nchap. II, para. 14)\r\nThe reality is that the international community is\r\nnowhere near realizing the above goals, as the circle of\r\nprosperity has not widened to include the majority of the\r\ndeveloping countries that are not so fortunate as to receive\r\nfavoured access to finance, markets and technology. In the\r\nUruguay Round, the priorities and interests of developing\r\ncountries have figured marginally even in areas such as\r\nmarkets for agricultural commodities, which constitute the\r\nmainstay of their economies. Commodity markets have\r\ncontinued to be depressed, and to be destabilized by\r\nchanging demand and supply conditions. Prices of\r\ncommodities have declined further, in some cases even in\r\nnominal terms. There is a danger that the establishment of\r\nregional trade blocs may exclude many developing countries\r\nfrom preferential access to the markets of the developed\r\ncountries.\r\nThe least developed countries are almost exclusively\r\ndependent on official development assistance (ODA) for\r\ntheir external financing and, because of their limited access\r\nto international financing markets and foreign direct\r\ninvestment, they have been unable to benefit from an\r\nincreased flow of external resources to developing countries\r\nthat has taken place in the past few years.\r\nWith the dramatic and profound changes that have taken\r\nplace in the world political and economic scene, the United\r\nNations has an unprecedented opportunity to play its Charter\r\nrole in the vital area of economic and social development\r\nthrough important international conferences, including the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, the forthcoming World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, to mention but a few. The preparatory\r\nprocess for these conferences has already identified the\r\nproblems encountered in contemporary international\r\neconomic relations and in development, and this should\r\nfacilitate the search for their solutions.\r\nThe proposed United Nations initiative on opportunity\r\nand participation will serve as a useful link for various\r\nresolutions adopted by the United Nations and especially by\r\nUnited Nations organized international conferences in\r\nseeking a methodology through which those goals and\r\nobjectives may be realized. The Human Development\r\nReport for 1993 states:\r\n4 57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November 1993\r\n\"People everywhere are certainly demanding much\r\ngreater access to political, economic and social\r\nopportunities. They might not expect ’full\r\nparticipation’ - but they do want a steady advancement\r\ntowards it. Participation is, after all, a process, not an\r\nevent ... it helps maximize the use of human\r\ncapabilities and is thus a means of increasing levels of\r\nsocial and economic development.\" (pp. 21 and 22)\r\nThe same can be said about nations. Opportunity and\r\nparticipation will certainly bring about effective partnership\r\nand equitable cooperation in the sphere of international\r\neconomic relations. Effective economic integration of\r\ndeveloping countries in the world economy could be a major\r\nstimulus to global economic activities, provided it remains\r\nopen and outward-looking and does not result in additional\r\nexternal barriers.\r\nMy delegation fully supports draft resolution A/48/L.19,\r\nwhich was introduced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nPapua New Guinea. It seeks the appointment of a United\r\nNations Panel on Opportunity and Participation composed of\r\na small number of distinguished experts and eminent\r\npersons, broadly representative of the international\r\ncommunity, in order to prepare a comprehensive report to be\r\nconsidered during the General Assembly’s fiftieth session.\r\nI am also pleased to announce my delegation’s\r\nsponsorship of the draft resolution, and I share the hope of\r\nmany previous speakers that it will be adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. LAING (Belize): It may well be the case that\r\nundemocratic and illiberal regimes are becoming an\r\nincreasingly rare species. As we approach the end of the\r\nmillennium, some think that this trend can be seen\r\neverywhere. While we have not witnessed the wholesale\r\nemergence of stable liberal democracies, liberal democracy\r\nhas become the universal political and economic aspiration,\r\nspanning different regions and cultures around the globe.\r\nLiberal principles such as individual freedom, popular\r\nsovereignty, free markets and free trade have become the\r\nnew watchwords and the means through which\r\nunderdevelopment can allegedly be definitively conquered.\r\nThe prescription to solve our social, political and economic\r\nproblems has now become that we in the developing world\r\nmust replace traditional forms of social organization with\r\neconomically rational ones based on function and efficiency;\r\nwe must open our markets to international trade and we\r\nmust tighten our belts, both metaphorically and in reality.\r\nStructural adjustment, too, is the popular euphemism.\r\nOver the past two decades many in the developing\r\nworld have dutifully followed the regimen that has been laid\r\nout for us. All of us have embarked on a process of reforms\r\nand the creation of structures wherein we must take the same\r\nprescribed medicine for the ills that plague us - and, indeed,\r\nseveral of us who have swallowed the pill have experienced\r\nreasonably high levels of material prosperity and long\r\nperiods of stability and positive economic growth.\r\nHowever, that is only part of the picture. In many\r\ncountries there have been no improvements. In fact, the\r\nsocio-political and economic situation has deteriorated to the\r\npoint where it threatens international stability. Problems\r\nabound in many of the countries that have accepted the\r\nprescription and swallowed the medicine. Indeed, it would\r\nbe accurate to say that the social, political and economic gap\r\nbetween the developed and the developing worlds has\r\nwidened, even as we in the developing world attempt to\r\nadopt the measures that are indispensable are told that we\r\nmust wait for growth and development to take off.\r\nWhy is this so? We believe that part of the truth lies\r\nin the fact that over the past quarter of a century we have\r\nbeen experiencing top-down development. Solutions have\r\nbeen mandated from the top - and when we say \"the top\",\r\nwe mean the international economic and financial\r\ninstitutions, development-oriented multilateral institutions\r\nand, indeed, those of us in leadership positions in our\r\nGovernments. We have told our people that they must\r\nfollow the uniform prescription to overcome the myriad\r\nproblems.\r\nWe have made a fundamental mistake throughout this\r\nentire process. We have not always related the institutions,\r\nstructures and remedies to the genuine needs of our people.\r\nAnd we have failed to give the people an adequate role in\r\narticulating and guiding their own political, economic and\r\nsocial destinies. We have compounded the problem by\r\nforgetting a basic truism, namely, that the primary purpose\r\nof development is to enlarge people’s opportunities and\r\nchoices.\r\nWe agree with the Human Development Report 1993\r\nthat:\r\n\"People today have an urge - an impatient urge -to\r\nparticipate in the events that shape their lives. And that\r\nimpatience brings many dangers and opportunities. It\r\ncan dissolve into anarchy, ethnic violence or social\r\ndisintegration. But if properly nurtured in a responsive\r\nnational and global framework, it can also become a\r\nsource of tremendous vitality and innovation for the\r\ncreation of new and more just societies.\" (UNDP\r\nHuman Development Report 1993, p. 1)\r\nWe see the Papua New Guinea initiative on opportunity and\r\nparticipation in this light. It provides an opportunity to\r\nbegin the dialogue on the means and mechanisms through\r\n57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November l993 5\r\nwhich we can involve our peoples in the process of\r\ndevelopment and further ensure that we create opportunities\r\nthat will enable them and us to meet their genuine needs.\r\nAfter all, a primary purpose of development is to create and\r\nenlarge social, economic, developmental and political\r\nopportunities.\r\nLet us, therefore, go beyond the formal symbolism of\r\ntalking about grass roots. The people must fully and truly\r\nparticipate in the widest possible horizontal range - that is to\r\nsay, villagers, trade unions, the aged, youth, native peoples\r\nand others usually overlooked in the top-down, verticalized\r\nprocess. In this light, this proposal is very timely. It is also\r\nopportune, because we are about to embark on a new\r\ndialogue about the issues of development with the\r\npresentation of the Secretary-General’s agenda for\r\ndevelopment. We are therefore happy to act as a sponsor of\r\nthe draft resolution embodying this worthy initiative.\r\nIf all that this initiative accomplishes is that the agenda\r\nfor development and the Assembly fully accept and\r\narticulate the critical importance of popular participation, it\r\nwill go down in history as a signal accomplishment.\r\nMr. VAN LIEROP (Vanuatu): Odd as it might seem,\r\nthis is the first occasion on which our delegation has come\r\nto the podium to speak during the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Thus, it gives us great pleasure to join\r\nin the congratulatory remarks previously addressed to you,\r\nSir, on your unanimous election to preside over the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nQuite aside from our long and deep personal friendship,\r\nand that of our respective countries and delegations, you are\r\nwell known for your professionalism, your diplomatic skills\r\nand your integrity. These are not easy qualities to come by.\r\nYou, therefore, are one of the most highly respected of all\r\nof our colleagues in this House. The manner in which you\r\nhave led our deliberations thus far has certainly justified our\r\ngreat faith in you.\r\nWe also take pleasure in thanking your predecessor and\r\ncommending his efforts during the forty-seventh session of\r\nthe General Assembly. We also join in the congratulations\r\nextended to the new States that have recently joined the\r\nUnited Nations, bringing us yet one step closer to our long-\r\ncherished goal of universality in the membership of the\r\nworld body.\r\nVanuatu is a sponsor of draft resolution A/48/L.19 on\r\nthe United Nations initiative on opportunity and\r\nparticipation. As such, we associate ourselves with the\r\nstatement made two days ago by the Foreign Minister of\r\nPapua New Guinea in introducing that draft resolution.\r\nThere is no doubt that the active involvement and full\r\nparticipation of everyone in a given society - men and\r\nwomen, young and old, the economically advantaged and the\r\ndisadvantaged, the physically firm and the infirm - are\r\nessential elements in the process of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Doors of opportunity that remain permanently\r\nclosed to any segment of a society tend to diminish the\r\nability of that society to realize its full potential. Similarly,\r\non a global scale doors of opportunity that remain\r\npermanently closed seriously diminish the ability of mankind\r\nto realize its full potential.\r\nThe process that led the world to Rio de Janeiro last\r\nyear for the United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment taught us the value of a global partnership.\r\nHowever, for that lesson to have a lasting and meaningful\r\nimpact the partnership will have to be further nurtured,\r\nstrengthened and institutionalized at its very roots. All\r\nsegments of society, beginning with the smallest, most\r\ndistant and most diverse communities, have their own unique\r\ncontributions to make. Those contributions should all be\r\nencouraged and valued for their unique worth.\r\nThat is one important aspect of the proposal on\r\nopportunity and participation. There is another, which we\r\nthink should also be borne in mind.\r\nAs electoral democracy spreads throughout the world -\r\nto big nations and small, in every corner of the globe, and\r\nto every village, hamlet and outer island - few ideas could\r\nmore appropriate or more timely than opportunity and\r\nparticipation. For, as electoral democracy spreads\r\nthroughout the world, new questions are being raised in both\r\nthe new democracies and the older democracies - questions\r\nabout economic justice and what the future holds in store for\r\nthose who have never had much margin for economic error.\r\nFears are being articulated about social equality, and new\r\nconcerns are being expressed about the future of\r\ninternational or multilateral democracy.\r\nEvery day, those who live and labour in developing\r\ncountries - particularly the smallest, the poorest and the most\r\necologically fragile - find themselves facing less and less\r\ncertain futures. Every day, the representatives of the people\r\nof such countries find themselves having to defend the right\r\nof those people to be heard, in all forums, on all issues, and\r\nhaving to defend, in international forums, the very\r\ndemocratic principles and practices that most people\r\nrecognize as being essential in their own countries.\r\nWe cannot help asking: is it not a cruel hoax to tell\r\nour people that they can have a voice in choosing a\r\nGovernment and Government representatives but then to\r\nconstruct elaborate processes that have the effect of denying\r\nthose Governments and those Government representatives\r\nthe opportunity to have an effect on the decision-making\r\n6 57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November 1993\r\nprocess? Is it not reasonable to expect the normal\r\nfundamental rules of participation in the democratic\r\nprocesses within countries to be looked upon favourably with\r\nrespect to participation in the decision-making processes in\r\ninternational forums?\r\nMany ideas are brought to mind by the initiative of the\r\nForeign Minister of Papua New Guinea. Like other\r\ndelegations, we have limited ourselves to commenting on a\r\nminimum of those ideas. We view this proposal as another\r\nimportant step in the global enfranchisement of those who\r\nare not yet enfranchised to the fullest extent possible. The\r\nideas that may be generated by this proposal, with their\r\npotential impact on peoples, communities and nations, are its\r\nmost appealing aspect.\r\nLike other sponsors of the draft resolution, we continue\r\nto be open-minded and receptive to the ideas of others.\r\nTherefore, consultations with a number of interested\r\ndelegations have continued, and some very positive\r\nsuggestions have been made and will be reflected in a\r\nrevised text. It is to be hoped that the draft resolution will\r\nbe adopted by consensus and that all of us will have an\r\nopportunity to participate in further refinement and\r\ndevelopment of this very timely and well-intentioned idea.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to inform delegations\r\nthat, in order to give the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth\r\nCommittee an opportunity to review the programme budget\r\nimplications of draft resolution A/48/L.19, action on it is\r\npostponed to a date to be announced.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 40\r\nTHE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA:\r\nPROCEDURES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A\r\nFIRM AND LASTING PEACE AND PROGRESS IN\r\nFASHIONING A REGION OF PEACE, FREEDOM,\r\nDEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT:\r\n(a) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL\r\n(A/48/586)\r\n(b) DRAFT RESOLUTION (A/48/L.21)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on Mr. Mario Carias Zapata,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Honduras, to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/48/L.21.\r\nMr. CARIAS ZAPATA (Honduras) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I wish, on behalf of the countries of the Central\r\nAmerican isthmus, to say again how pleased we are that\r\nyou, Sir, are presiding at this General Assembly session, in\r\nwhich each of us has promised you support and cooperation\r\nas you discharge your delicate tasks.\r\nAt its forty-seventh session, the General Assembly\r\npraised the Central American effort to achieve peace through\r\nimplementation of the \"Procedures for the establishment of\r\na firm and lasting peace in Central America\" and of the\r\nagreements, adopted at summit meetings, that reaffirm the\r\ndecision of the Central American Presidents to declare\r\nCentral America a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nToday, Central America is at one of the most important\r\nstages in its recent history - that of the consolidation of\r\ndemocracy. Evidence of this is the conclusion of the\r\ninternational Treaty known as the Tegucigalpa Protocol of 13\r\nDecember 1991, which created the Central American\r\nIntegration System (SICA). That Protocol reflects the\r\npolitical and legal regeneration of the region as a cohesive\r\nexercise in integrated development to be undertaken through\r\nmachinery of regional coordination - machinery that has\r\nbeen functioning since 1 February this year - with a view to\r\nreinvigorating economic, social, cultural and political\r\nprogrammes, as well as programmes concerning the Central\r\nAmerican environment.\r\nWe therefore agree with the efforts of the United\r\nNations Secretary-General, who, since 1992, has been\r\nstriving to bring about coordination within the United\r\nNations and who, in his most recent memorandum, talks of\r\nthe need for an integrated approach to development, based\r\non the indivisible elements of peace, democracy and\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\nFurthermore, we believe that the establishment of\r\ndemocratic regimes in our countries does not by itself\r\nguarantee solution of the major social, political and\r\neconomic problems that we, as countries and as a region,\r\nconfront. Democracy in Central America requires\r\nunderstanding and sustained support from the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report to the General\r\nAssembly, says:\r\n\"Social disparities remain a source of tensions. With\r\nregard to health care, housing, education and\r\nemployment, the region’s indicators continue to be a\r\ncause for concern. Across the region, extreme poverty\r\nhas been on the increase in recent years. In addition,\r\nnew challenges have emerged, such as drug trafficking\r\nand environmental degradation.\" (A/48/586, para. 7)\r\nTo trace and undertake a new course of development in\r\npeace and democracy, our countries require, as a minimum,\r\n57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November l993 7\r\na framework of stability that is in accordance with the\r\nspecial features of each country. The common denominator\r\nis the achievement of national consensus in respect of peace\r\nand development. That is how the socio-economic problems\r\nwill be solved and the sustained human development\r\nnecessary to ensuring that resources reach the most needy\r\nsectors of the population will be made possible.\r\nThe Central American Governments, aware of their\r\nhistoric responsibility to ensure that their peoples may enjoy\r\npeace, security, justice and social development, have\r\nconsistently striven, in all areas and at all levels, to achieve\r\nthe goals that were set in 1987. That is why in this forum,\r\nwe speak with a single voice, in a spirit of unity, and with\r\na single hope - that better standards of living may be\r\nprovided for our peoples.\r\nThe Central American Presidents met 14 times and\r\nsigned agreements of the greatest importance for Central\r\nAmerica. During those meetings they called for the support\r\nand assistance of the international community. Its response\r\nwas not long in coming: the participation of the United\r\nNations in the peace processes in El Salvador and Nicaragua,\r\nand now in Guatemala, and its participation in programmes\r\nof cooperation such as the Special Plan of Economic\r\nCooperation for Central America (PEC), has mobilized\r\nimportant resources for the region as part of emergency\r\nprogrammes, and immediate-action and social-and-economic\r\nrecovery programmes.\r\nThe Programme for Displaced Persons, Refugees and\r\nReturnees developed through the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme has made an innovative\r\ncontribution in Central America by establishing procedures\r\nwhich have mobilized various social sectors in the region to\r\nwork together to find solutions to common problems.\r\nNevertheless, regardless of the efforts undertaken and\r\nthe resources invested in Central America, there remain\r\nserious political, economic and social problems which could\r\nnullify the gains made to date. In the present debate in the\r\nAssembly, and throughout the general debate, representatives\r\nof our countries at the very highest level have expressed\r\nconcern on the subject - and, because of its importance, I\r\nconsider it appropriate to remind members of this.\r\nThus , the Pres iden t o f E l Sa lvador ,\r\nMr. Alfredo Cristiani Burkard, stated:\r\n\"The rhythm of transformation occurs in a way that\r\ncannot be resisted. We see this in the changing\r\ninternational, political and economic relations of our\r\ntime. An almost spontaneous restructuring has\r\nfollowed the removal of so many straitjackets. And\r\nthis restructuring has brought to light what has always\r\nbeen most important: the real problems. As the East-\r\nWest conflict has disappeared, almost no one speaks\r\nabout the North-South conflict or alternative alignments,\r\nbut the serious problems of inequality, critical poverty\r\nand dependence have not been resolved. They are still\r\nwith us. And they are a challenge for this new order\r\nwhich we are trying to create on a more rational and\r\nreasonable foundation.\" (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Forty-eighth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 5th meeting, p. 3)\r\nMinister Bernd H. Niehaus Quesada of Costa Rica\r\nreminded us:\r\n\"Those who were interested in a Central America full\r\nof bloodshed and trenches do not want to deal with a\r\nCentral America of the poor, the Central America that\r\ncalls for cooperation for development, for understanding\r\nof its human and economic tragedies.\" (Official Records\r\nof the General Assembly, Forty-eighth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 23rd meeting, p. 9)\r\nI should also like to remind members of the efforts of\r\nthe Government of Nicaragua to promote economic recovery\r\nwithin the framework of and adjustment process that\r\nincludes economic growth and development - a process that\r\nhas been hampered by the violence that was a product of\r\nwar, by the needs of thousands of displaced persons,\r\nrefugees and unemployed who must be integrated into the\r\ncountry’s economic activities and by the effects of natural\r\ndisasters. The Government of Nicaragua has also made\r\nimportant progress in bringing about broad social consensus\r\nthrough national dialogue, the adoption of measures that will\r\nlay the bases for reconstruction, and economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn fact the case of Nicaragua is special. It has had to\r\ngo through a threefold transition. It is overcoming the\r\naftermath of war; it is building democracy; and it is restoring\r\ndynamism and strength to the economy in a society that is\r\nstill polarized. That makes it necessary to give Nicaragua\r\nspecial treatment which will allow for flexibility in the\r\napplication of structural-adjustment measures, so that,\r\nwithout losing its sense of direction, it can obtain loans and\r\ninvestments - on preferential terms - designed to provide\r\nincentives to social investment and local production, and\r\n8 57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November 1993\r\nenable it to adapt to the pace of fiscal adjustment, the\r\nreduction of import customs duties and the freeing up of the\r\nfinancial system.\r\nAs part of these efforts, the Central American\r\nPresidents met in Guatemala City from 27 to 29 October last\r\nin their fourteenth summit. Their political Declaration\r\ncontained this statement:\r\n\"The democracy we have been building with such\r\ngreat hope is beginning to reap the fruits of a peaceful\r\nCentral America - a Central America invigorated by a\r\nnew integrationist vision capable of changing the course\r\nof history.\"\r\nThe Presidents also declared:\r\n\"... we have launched a bold and innovative integration\r\nprocess that has given us regional institutions and\r\nforums that include presidential summits, the Central\r\nAmerican Parliament and the Central American Court\r\nof Justice, all of which are expressions of the legal and\r\npolitical framework established by the Tegucigalpa\r\nProtocol.\"\r\nIn the operative part of the Declaration the Presidents\r\ndecided that they\r\n\"... will promote the establishment of a Central\r\nAmerican social investment fund under the auspices of\r\nthe Central American Integration Bank to fight poverty,\r\nto promote social works, and to improve the people’s\r\nstandard of living by financing social development\r\nprogrammes.\"\r\nThey also called on the international community to\r\nsupport this initiative at the international conference for\r\npeace and development in Central America which they hope\r\nto convene in 1994.\r\nThe Presidents stated:\r\n\"Central America offers all the necessary conditions for\r\nthe independent implementation of a peace plan and an\r\nagenda for development. Our efforts, together with\r\nspecific expressions of international solidarity, will\r\nallow us to make our region a model for resolving\r\nconflicts, consolidating peace, and enhancing\r\ndemocracy through comprehensive development.\"\r\nFollowing these guidelines laid down at the Summit,\r\nyesterday the Central American countries, at the invitation of\r\nthe Administrator of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), attended a technical international\r\nmeeting with the community of donor countries, specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations system, and other regional\r\norganizations, with a view to relaunching and revitalizing\r\nprogrammes and reviewing what has been achieved so far,\r\nand seeking new initiatives in multilateral cooperation for the\r\nregion.\r\nCentral America, like other regions, has to face and\r\novercome serious difficulties that are curbing its\r\ndevelopment. We are therefore striving to achieve\r\ndiversification of our production structures, in the quest for\r\nnew markets for our products and in order to attract the\r\nnecessary foreign-investment flows. As Mr. Arosemena, on\r\nbehalf of the late Mr. Julio E. Linares, the Foreign Minister\r\nof Panama, reminded us in the Assembly:\r\n\"The Central American countries are striving to\r\nbuild a peaceful, free, democratic and developing\r\nregion. For that reason, the efforts to bolster peace that\r\nhave been initiated require actions capable of solving\r\nour economic, social cultural and humanitarian\r\nproblems in order to strengthen our peoples’ faith in\r\ndemocracy.\" (Official records of the General Assembly,\r\nForty-eighth Session, Plenary Meetings, 17th meeting,\r\np. 6)\r\nOur region wishes to record its gratitude for the results\r\nof the political dialogue and economic cooperation between\r\nthe European Union and its member States, the States of\r\nCentral America and Panama, and the Group of cooperating\r\ncountries - Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela - and also for\r\nthe initiative of the industrialized countries which, with us,\r\nmake up the forum known as the Partnership for Democracy\r\nand Development in Central America.\r\nWe are also aware that the operations of the United\r\nNations that have been undertaken in the area, such as the\r\nPEC and the International Conference on Central American\r\nRefugees (CIREFCA) have yielded many results. But\r\nCIREFCA still has to conclude its operational cycle in May\r\n1994, and PEC may meet difficulties in obtaining financial\r\nresources to complete its programmes, which will give it\r\nnew prospects and more time for international cooperation\r\nfor Central America.\r\nThat is why, with a view to making a substantial\r\ncontribution to the process of transforming our region,\r\nCentral America is submitting for the General Assembly’s\r\nconsideration draft resolution A/48/L.21, which I have the\r\nhonour of introducing and in which we set forth new\r\nconcepts for this recovery and call for support for national\r\nand regional actions that have been taken. We wish to\r\nconsolidate the principal achievements in the quest for peace,\r\nnational reconciliation and economic reconstruction and to\r\ntake up the challenges and problems to be solved with the\r\nsupport of the international community, which has an\r\n57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November l993 9\r\nirreplaceable role to play in Central America. We hope that\r\nthe Assembly will adopt this draft resolution without a vote.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like once again to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his work and the report which he has\r\npresented to us on the situation in Central America and\r\nwhich is contained in document A/48/586. We are\r\nparticularly grateful to those who made it possible for the\r\nSpecial Plan of Economic Cooperation for Central America\r\nto be a substantial contribution by our Organization and the\r\ninternational community to Central America.\r\nMuch remains to be done, but we have faith and\r\nconfidence that our efforts and those of the international\r\ncommunity will enable us to work together for a better\r\nfuture for the peoples of Central America.\r\nMr. NOTERDAEME (Belgium) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the honour of speaking on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union in this debate on the situation in Central\r\nAmerica, which has begun with the introduction of a draft\r\nresolution of which we have become aware only today. In\r\nthe circumstances, the European Union wishes to make it\r\nclear that its statement in the debate will in no way prejudge\r\nits position on the draft resolution.\r\nSince the San José Declaration in 1984, the peace\r\nprocesses in Central America have enjoyed substantial\r\nsupport from the European Union. For some years now,\r\nthey have also been closely followed by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe overall situation in Central America has improved\r\nsince the 1980s in terms of democratization, the\r\nconsolidation of peace, and regional stability and integration.\r\nNevertheless, the Esquipulas Agreements have been\r\nimplemented in different ways in different countries.\r\nImplementation has given rise to tempered optimism or to\r\nhope in certain cases; but other situations, where national\r\nreconciliation and the consolidation of peace are still out of\r\nreach, remain a matter of concern.\r\nFar from discouraging us, the remaining difficulties\r\nmust strengthen the common determination of the peoples\r\nand Governments of the region and of the international\r\ncommunity to persist in their efforts. I should like to pay a\r\ntribute to the Governments and political leaders of Central\r\nAmerican countries that have exhibited the vision that is\r\nindispensable if their peoples are to move forward on the\r\npath of peace, development and democracy.\r\nAlthough still fragile, the decisive progress in the\r\nSalvadorian peace process is one of the remarkable\r\nachievements in which our Organization can take pride. I\r\nshould like to congratulate the United Nations Observer\r\nMission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) and its personnel on the\r\npositive results they have achieved so far in the restoration\r\nof peace in El Salvador.\r\nThe European Union is determined to continue to play\r\nits full role both within the framework of the political\r\ndialogue with the Central American countries and in terms\r\nof cooperation. We must nevertheless recall that the solution\r\nto remaining conflicts must come from the Central\r\nAmericans themselves.\r\nArmed conflict in El Salvador is now a thing of the\r\npast. We must welcome this success for peace, which we\r\nowe to the realism displayed by both parties and to the\r\nefforts of the international community and, in particular, the\r\nUnited Nations. The European Union has lent its\r\nunswerving support to the implementation of the Peace\r\nAccords and continues to stress respect for all their parts.\r\nWe welcome the measures taken by the Government to\r\nimplement the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Commission\r\non the Purification of the Armed Forces, to reduce the size\r\nof the army, and to demobilize the Frente Farabundo Martí\r\npara la Liberación Nacional (FMLN) and transform it into a\r\npolitical party.\r\nDespite such undeniable progress, recent developments\r\nin El Salvador have aroused concern. As the beginning of\r\nthe electoral campaign approaches, the intensification of\r\npolitical violence, noted in the latest report of the Human\r\nRights Division of ONUSAL, and the resurgence of illegal\r\narmed groups, noted in the latest report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the recommendations of the Commission on the\r\nTruth, remind us of the continued fragility of the process for\r\nthe peaceful settlement of the Salvadorian crisis. On 28\r\nOctober, the European Union expressed its concern at the\r\nresurgence of political violence and asked President Cristiani\r\nto see to it that those responsible for violence are caught and\r\nbrought to trial.\r\nRecently, the Secretary-General stressed the importance\r\nof making up for the delay that has occurred in the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the Commission\r\non the Truth. He also stressed the need to respect the Peace\r\nAccords. In order to break the vicious circle of violence, he\r\ncalled for the rapid establishment of the machinery for\r\ninvestigating illegal armed groups, and the establishment of\r\nthe national Civil Police and the land-transfer programme.\r\nIn his statement of 5 November, the President of the\r\nSecurity Council supported the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations.\r\nThe European Union attaches particular importance to\r\nthe implementation of the recommendations of the\r\nCommission on the Truth. The European Union, which has\r\ncontributed through substantial action to the reinsertion of\r\n10 57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November 1993\r\nformer combatants into the agricultural sphere, also wishes\r\nto see the problems related to land distribution solved.\r\nSimilarly, the new national Civil Police must receive the\r\nnecessary resources to perform its task efficiently. The\r\nEuropean Union is now studying the matter of what\r\nresources it can use to help the new Civil Police Academy.\r\nSerious efforts are still required before the human rights\r\nsituation will be satisfactory. In particular, an end should be\r\nput to ordinary violence that may conceal political motives.\r\nFinally, all progress achieved must be confirmed by a\r\nproperly conducted electoral process. The elections next\r\nMarch will be a decisive test of the peace process. The\r\nimpartiality of the bodies responsible for the proper conduct\r\nof the elections, broad participation in the elections, and the\r\npeaceful acceptance of the voters’ choice will be the criteria\r\nfor success. Following up the efforts it has already made in\r\nregard to the preparations for the electoral process, the\r\nEuropean Union is now actively considering an assistance\r\nproject aimed at contributing to the training of the personnel\r\nresponsible for the proper conduct of the elections.\r\nONUSAL, whose mandate has been expanded to include\r\nobservation of the elections, will make a valuable\r\ncontribution to the electoral process.\r\nHaving condemned the suspension of constitutional\r\norder in Guatemala, the European Union welcomed its\r\npeaceful restoration and expressed its support for President\r\nde León Carpio.\r\nWe earnestly hope that the President of Guatemala will\r\nsucceed in consolidating democratic institutions and the\r\ndominance of civilian authority. We note his proposal to\r\npromote national dialogue and solve the most severe social\r\nproblems, but we are concerned that the proposal does not\r\nyet enjoy the support of all segments of society and we call\r\non all parties concerned to show flexibility by permitting the\r\nbroadest possible participation in the political and social\r\nprocess. We hope too that resumed peace negotiations will\r\nrapidly end this, the oldest, armed conflict in Central\r\nAmerica, and will bring about profound political and social\r\nreforms.\r\nWe welcome the fact that both the Government of\r\nGuatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional\r\nGuatemalteca (URNG) have requested the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s help in facilitating the resumption of dialogue. In\r\nthat connection, we support the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to promote that dialogue. The European Union\r\nreiterates the great importance it attaches to significant\r\nimprovement in the human rights situation and, in particular,\r\nin efforts to punish the guilty.\r\nThe European Union is pleased that Guatemala has\r\naffirmed its recognition of Belize, and hopes that those two\r\ncountries will continue to improve their relations and settle\r\ntheir territorial dispute once and for all.\r\nTurning to Nicaragua, the European Union notes with\r\nconcern the deterioration of the situation in that country.\r\nDespite the amnesty declared by the Government, the\r\nsituation of demobilized personnel has not led to true peace.\r\nWe reiterate our firm support for President Chamorro’s\r\nefforts to promote dialogue and national reconciliation and\r\nto assure civilian control over the army. We call on all\r\npolitical forces to respect their commitment not to turn to\r\npolitical violence, to overcome their differences and to make\r\nthe necessary effort to implement a plan for national\r\nreconciliation placing the higher interests of the country\r\nabove political antagonisms. The support the European\r\nUnion has given for many years to the Central American\r\npeace process and the significant assistance it provides to\r\nNicaragua in that framework entitle the Union to issue this\r\nappeal - by which it intends no interference - to the political\r\ngroupings in Nicaragua. While the international community\r\nis continuing its efforts to contribute to the process of\r\nnational reconciliation, the primary responsibility for this still\r\nbelongs to the Nicaraguans.\r\nWe hope the mediation efforts of the Central American\r\nPresidents and the Organization of American States (OAS)\r\nwill make it possible very shortly to achieve a true national\r\nagreement.\r\nAnother priority concern of the European Union with\r\nrespect to Central America is human rights. There can be\r\nno lasting economic development or political stability\r\nwithout human rights guarantees.\r\nThe efforts of the European Union in this sphere are\r\nalso reflected in its support for many practical projects\r\nrelating to democratization and human rights. We share the\r\ngratification of our Central American partners at the fact that\r\nthe multi-year programme for the promotion of human\r\nrights, solemnly launched at the Lisbon conference in\r\nFebruary 1992 by the European Union and the countries of\r\nCentral America, has come up to speed. That programme\r\njoins many other endeavours in support of democratization,\r\nelectoral processes in particular.\r\nThe European Union has continued its efforts for the\r\nreintegration of refugees and displaced or demobilized\r\npersons, particularly with respect to El Salvador and\r\nNicaragua, and for the return of Guatemalan refugees.\r\nTo support the fight of these countries against drug\r\ntrafficking, the European Union has provided Central\r\n57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November l993 11\r\nAmerican countries with trading facilities in the European\r\nmarket.\r\nThe European Union reaffirms its determination to\r\ncooperate with the Central American countries in their\r\nefforts to protect the environment and restore ecological\r\nbalance.\r\nThe European Union also welcomes the resumption of\r\nthe integration process, marked by the implementation of the\r\nCentral American Integration System and the establishment\r\nof the Central American parliament, which it supports.\r\nWe have noted with interest initiatives such as the\r\nCaracas Commitment and the Caracas Statement issued by\r\nthe Central American countries and the Group of Three to\r\npromote cooperation and trade.\r\nThe implementation of the San Salvador Agreement\r\nbetween the European Union and Central America, signed at\r\nthe ninth San José ministerial meeting, held in El Salvador\r\nin February 1993, marks a new stage in relations between\r\nthe two regions and opens the way for continued and\r\nintensified Community cooperation. I would recall that the\r\nEuropean Union is the largest provider of assistance to the\r\nregion.\r\nNext year we mark the tenth anniversary of our\r\ndialogue with Central America, a dialogue through which we\r\nhave striven to support the peace processes, both politically\r\nand in terms of cooperation. The progress is encouraging,\r\nbut firm support from us and from the international\r\ncommunity at large remains indispensable. The European\r\nUnion vigorously reaffirms its commitment to promote\r\npeace, democracy and development in Central America.\r\nMr. HATANO (Japan): The Central American peace\r\nprocess has made remarkable progress in the past six years,\r\nsince the Esquipulas Agreements were concluded. The\r\npeoples of El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua have\r\ndemonstrated an unshakeable determination to overcome\r\ndecades of violence, repression and deprivation. Their\r\nprogress towards reconciliation and reconstruction, bolstered\r\nby the initiatives of like-minded countries, has demonstrated\r\nthat peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts may be\r\neffectively combined. Indeed, I believe the experience in\r\nCentral America can serve as a model for similar endeavours\r\nin other regions.\r\nDecades of conflict and mistrust cannot be forgotten\r\novernight, and numerous obstacles remain on the path to\r\nlasting peace. Japan has various concerns about the situation\r\nin the region, and I would like to touch on them very\r\nbriefly.\r\nFirst, in El Salvador, the signing of the Chapultepec\r\nAgreement by the Government and the Farabundo Martí\r\nNational Liberation Front (FMLN) in January of last year\r\nformally ended the armed conflict and marked a turning-\r\npoint for both the country and the region. Japan warmly\r\napplauded the good-faith efforts made by both sides in the\r\nnegotiating process. Recently, however, violence has once\r\nagain erupted in El Salvador, prompting the Security Council\r\nto call for a thorough and prompt investigation and to\r\nreaffirm the importance of the full and timely\r\nimplementation of all the provisions of the peace agreement.\r\nJapan remains concerned about delays in implementing the\r\nagreement, but recognizes that the development of mutual\r\ntrust will require time, patience and much wisdom. Japan\r\ntrusts that both sides will recognize the need to adhere to a\r\ndefinite timetable, and that they will overcome their\r\nremaining difficulties in a peaceful manner.\r\nJapan regards the forthcoming election in El Salvador\r\nas the culmination of the entire peace process, and hopes\r\nthat the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador\r\n(ONUSAL), which is playing a key role in that process, will\r\nensure the credibility of that election. This is essential to the\r\nestablishment of lasting peace and stability.\r\nI turn now to Guatemala. Japan welcomed the\r\ninauguration of Mr. Ramiro de León Carpio as that country’s\r\nnew President, democratically elected following the partial\r\nsuspension of the Constitution by the former President last\r\nMay. We hope the negotiations between the Government\r\nand the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union will be\r\nresumed promptly so as to strengthen the stability of the\r\ncountry.\r\nWith regard to Nicaragua, Japan has welcomed the\r\nefforts made by President Chamorro towards political\r\nreconciliation, even as she has had to cope with the\r\ndifficulties of presiding over a divided Congress. Recalling\r\nthe crisis that occurred last August, Japan hopes that all\r\npolitical and social divisions within Nicaragua will be\r\novercome through negotiations - for example, through the\r\nnational tripartite dialogue between the Nicaraguan\r\nGovernment, the FSLN and the UNO - and that further\r\nprogress will be made in the democratization efforts,\r\nincluding civilian control of the armed forces. Japan\r\noutlined its concerns about the situation in Nicaragua more\r\nfully in its statement on agenda item 45, \"International\r\nassistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of\r\nNicaragua\", at the current session.\r\nAlthough genuine progress has been made in the\r\nestablishment of peace and stability throughout Central\r\nAmerica, serious difficulties still remain. But, rather than\r\nallowing ourselves to become discouraged by these\r\ndifficulties, we should be challenged to resolve them by\r\n12 57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November 1993\r\ncombining peace-keeping and peace-building efforts in new\r\nand creative ways.\r\nIn this context, Japan is extending various kinds of\r\nmedium- and long-term cooperation, including yen loans,\r\ngeneral grant aid and technical cooperation, to the countries\r\nin the region. In addition, it provides emergency assistance\r\nto the people of Central America at times of natural\r\ndisasters. We hope that this development and humanitarian\r\nassistance will also help to advance the peace process and\r\nensure that it is irreversible.\r\nIn addition to bilateral assistance, intra-regional\r\ncooperation is also important. Japan has been actively\r\nparticipating in various activities of the Partnership for\r\nDemocracy and Development in Central America ever since\r\nit was established. Japan also serves as Co-Chairman of the\r\nWorking Group on Economic Development, and presided\r\nover the Central American ministerial meeting last March in\r\nTokyo. The success of the meeting was reflective of the\r\nprogress that has been made in the peace process throughout\r\nthe region. Japan will continue to support, in these and\r\nother forums, the initiatives of the nations of Central\r\nAmerica.\r\nIn closing, I would like to note that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who has played an important role in restoring peace\r\nand stability to Central America, deserves our admiration\r\nand strengthened support. I wish to emphasize that both the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council should follow\r\nthe situation in Central America very closely, with a view to\r\napplying the concept of peace-building in its most innovative\r\nsense. We hope that our experience in the region will spur\r\nfurther United Nations efforts to pursue peace-keeping,\r\npeacemaking and peace-building in other parts of the world.\r\nJapan is among the many nations that vigorously support this\r\nexpansion of the United Nations role on behalf of world\r\npeace.\r\nMr. BIVERO (Venezuela) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Venezuela attaches particular importance to the\r\nitem on the situation in Central America, because of its\r\ntraditional ties of friendship and solidarity with all the\r\ncountries of the area, and because of its permanent\r\ncommitment to seeking solutions to the serious political,\r\neconomic and social difficulties that those countries have had\r\nto face, to the serious detriment of their development\r\nprocesses.\r\nToday, as the Secretary-General stresses, the region is\r\nfirmly committed to a process of consolidating peace, which\r\ngenerally has reached a level of significant stability. The\r\ninternational community has been involved in this progress,\r\nsupporting the processes of national peace and reconciliation\r\nas well as those of economic reconstruction and recovery,\r\nwhich are closely linked to them.\r\nVenezuela, both individually and together with other\r\ncountries with particular links to, and interests in, the region,\r\nwill continue to support these processes, politically as well\r\nas economically. We have always been careful to respect\r\nthe will of the Central American countries themselves, being\r\nconvinced that the consolidation of peace and the promotion\r\nof development in the region will be more stable and long-\r\nlasting the more they respond to the convictions of those\r\ncountries. This is an appropriate occasion to express our\r\ngratitude and admiration for the constant efforts of the\r\nCentral American countries to identify and promote their\r\nown priorities in an exercise of affirmation that deserves the\r\nsupport of the entire international community.\r\nVenezuela recognizes the particular characteristics of\r\neach national political policy process in Central America as\r\nwell as the obstacles facing them. We will continue to be as\r\nobjective as possible, with continuing support for the\r\nSecretary-General’s good offices and for the will of the\r\nparties that have placed their trust in them. We are pleased\r\nwith the progress described in the Secretary-General’s report\r\nin this regard, and we note its assessments of the stage\r\nreached in each of these political processes of peace and\r\nnational reconciliation. Venezuela will continue to work\r\nwith them, as a friendly country, in the search for and the\r\npromotion of progress.\r\nIn the area of economic cooperation, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report also indicates, Venezuela has endeavoured\r\nto contribute to the reactivation of the Central American\r\neconomies and the strengthening of ties of interdependence.\r\nIt has done so both individually and with other countries of\r\nthe area, in particular Colombia and Mexico, with which it\r\nforms the Group of Three.\r\nI should like in this respect to highlight the signing on\r\n12 February 1993, the signing of the Caracas Commitment,\r\nwhich established a new framework for cooperation between\r\nthe Group of Three and the Central American region, as well\r\nas the Caracas Statement which renews the Group’s\r\ncommitment to create a free trade zone.\r\nYesterday we took part in the first international\r\ntechnical meeting on Central America. Here I should\r\nmention that Venezuela supports the Central American\r\ncountries’ initiative - they were represented in the technical\r\nmeeting at ministerial level - to begin working towards an\r\ninternational conference for peace and development in\r\nCentral America that would enable them to consolidate the\r\nprogress in these areas that has been achieved so far, and to\r\nlay down sound foundations for multilateral cooperation in\r\nfuture.\r\n57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November l993 13\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to offer our wholehearted support\r\nfor the conclusions of the Secretary-General’s report, which\r\nsays that Central America has emerged from the difficult\r\ndecade of the 1980s with a dynamic institutional framework,\r\na comprehensive social and economic agenda and an active\r\nand constructive partnership with the international\r\ncommunity, which will undoubtedly make it possible for\r\nCentral America to continue to rely on international\r\nsolidarity and to make use of it for the benefit of its\r\npeoples. Venezuela supports the United Nations continuing\r\ninterest in, and support for, this process. We are sure that\r\nthe General Assembly will ratify its collective commitment\r\nto peace, democracy and development in Central America.\r\nMr. OSVALD (Sweden): Over the last few years\r\ndevelopments in Central America have been, by and large,\r\nvery encouraging. The wind of democracy has swept away\r\nauthoritarian regimes. Almost everywhere, war and conflict\r\nhave given way to peace and reconciliation. There are now\r\ngenuine prospects for dealing constructively with the\r\neconomic and social injustices that have always been the\r\nroots of the conflicts in the region.\r\nSince the outset, Sweden has actively supported the\r\npeace process in Central America. We shall continue to do\r\nso.\r\nThe objective of our political and economic endeavours\r\nin the region has always been to contribute to the promotion\r\nof peace, reconciliation, democracy and respect for human\r\nrights. In addition, Sweden supports economic reforms\r\naiming at growth, increased trade and investment and a more\r\nequitable distribution of income favouring the poorest groups\r\nof the population, in so far as these objectives are part of the\r\ndevelopment efforts of the Central American countries and\r\ntheir commitments towards human rights and environmental\r\nprotection.\r\nSweden has had programmes for development\r\ncooperation in Central America for more than 10 years. On\r\naverage, our yearly contribution to the region for\r\ndevelopment projects and humanitarian assistance has been\r\n$115 million. This includes assistance under bilateral\r\nagreements, through the United Nations, or through regional\r\nas well as non-governmental organizations.\r\nSweden strongly supports the ongoing regional\r\nintegration efforts in Central America. Such regional\r\ncooperation is, in our view, crucial for stability and\r\ndemocracy in the region.\r\nThe International Conference on Central American\r\nRefugees (CIREFCA) process is a good example of what\r\ncan be achieved through internationally supported regional\r\ncooperation. We support and are carefully monitoring joint\r\nefforts by the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme to find a modality for giving\r\ncontinuation to the major aspects of the CIREFCA process\r\nafter its conclusion in April 1994.\r\nSweden wholeheartedly supports the United Nations\r\nactivities in Central America. As the peace process\r\ncontinues, we hope that these efforts can be expanded. The\r\nimportance of the international community’s political and\r\neconomic support for Central America cannot be\r\noverestimated.\r\nThe progress made in the peace process in El Salvador\r\nis promising. The parties themselves and the United Nations\r\nthrough the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador\r\n(ONUSAL), have been the main contributors to this positive\r\ndevelopment. We consider it essential that ONUSAL should\r\nbe able to continue its task and to support the peace process\r\nuntil the situation in El Salvador has been firmly\r\nconsolidated. The will for peace and the courage and the\r\nwillingness of the parties to compromise have made it\r\npossible to find solutions to many difficult and sensitive\r\nproblems.\r\nSweden notes with satisfaction that many of the\r\nrecommendations of the Commission on the Truth have now\r\nbeen implemented. We share the view of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the remaining recommendations especially those\r\nconcerning reform of the judicial system, investigation of the\r\nactivities of illegal groups and the ban on holding public\r\noffice placed on individuals mentioned in the Commission’s\r\nreport - should be implemented before the start of the\r\nelection campaign. The time between now and the elections\r\nin March next year will be of crucial importance. One of\r\nthe main tasks must be to speed up voter registration and\r\nmake it as comprehensive as possible. This is necessary to\r\nensure the credibility of the election process.\r\nFurthermore, the peace agreements must be fully\r\nimplemented in order to promote a favourable political\r\natmosphere. We are therefore concerned about the delays\r\nwith regard to the creation of the new civilian police, the\r\nreintegration of former soldiers and ex-FMLN combatants\r\ninto civilian society, and the redistribution of land.\r\nRecent acts of violence, notably the assassination of\r\nFMLN leaders, is another cause of grave concern to Sweden.\r\nWe expect these acts to be promptly investigated and the\r\nguilty brought to justice.\r\nIt is of great importance that the international\r\ncommunity should contribute by all means available to the\r\nrealization of free and fair elections in El Salvador. Sweden\r\nhas already stated its willingness to engage in the process by\r\n14 57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November 1993\r\nproviding personnel, both in the preparatory phase of the\r\nelections and as election observers. In addition, Sweden has\r\ndecided to allocate $7.5 million yearly over a period of three\r\nyears, in part for the election process and in part for the\r\nsuccessful installation of a new national civilian police force.\r\nSweden salutes the victory of the democratic and\r\ncivilian forces in Guatemala earlier this year. We have\r\nstrong reasons to hope that President Ramiro de León Carpio\r\nwill continue the democratization and will vigorously\r\npromote respect for human rights. The early resumption of\r\nthe peace negotiations between the Government of\r\nGuatemala and the URNG would make a crucial contribution\r\nto the consolidation of democracy and national\r\nreconciliation. President Ramiro de León Carpio has taken\r\nsteps to help reactivate the negotiations.\r\nIn Sweden’s view, an increased role for the United\r\nNations in the negotiations in Guatemala may be of benefit\r\nto the peace process in Guatemala as a whole. We welcome\r\nthe fact that both the Government and the URNG have\r\nexpressed interest in a United Nations involvement.\r\nSweden will continue to follow the peace process in\r\nGuatemala closely. We are prepared to contribute to the\r\nprocess, provided the parties agree that this would be\r\nconstructive.\r\nWe are still concerned about the human rights situation\r\nin Guatemala. A breakthrough in the peace negotiations is,\r\nin our view, likely to have a positive impact in this field. A\r\nseparate, internationally verified agreement between the two\r\nparties on human rights issues would enhance the prospects\r\nfor peace. Sweden provides assistance to Guatemala in areas\r\nsuch as human rights, and we are prepared to make\r\nadditional efforts in this regard.\r\nThe agreement regarding repatriation of refugees, signed\r\na year ago by the Guatemalan Government and\r\nrepresentatives of the Guatemalan refugees, is unique and\r\nmerits respect from all parties involved. It is important that\r\nthis agreement be carried out as stipulated. Sweden will\r\ncontinue to monitor and support the implementation of the\r\nagreement, and we are encouraged by the recent reports in\r\nthis regard.\r\nThe path towards mutual understanding and national\r\nreconciliation chosen by the Government of Nicaragua has\r\nour full support. However, the political basis for this\r\nendeavour must be broadened.\r\nSweden is aware of the difficult economic problems\r\nthat the Nicaraguan leadership is confronting today. The\r\ncontinuation of Sweden’s programme for development\r\ncooperation, amounting to $35 million during the current\r\nfiscal year, is a recognition of this fact.\r\nOur objectives are firm. One aim of our assistance is\r\nto support Nicaragua’s own efforts towards national\r\nreconciliation and a strengthening of democracy. Another is\r\nto promote the Nicaraguan programmes for economic\r\nstabilization and growth. Only through a consistent donor\r\npolicy will we be able to maintain confidence in our\r\nprogramme for development cooperation with Nicaragua.\r\nHowever, when required, we have made the necessary\r\nmodifications to our policy, and we urge other donor\r\ncountries to show flexibility.\r\nSweden is of the view that the acute crisis in Nicaragua\r\nis basically political in nature. A national consensus must be\r\nreached on a number of fundamental political issues in order\r\nto create the conditions for a comprehensive approach to\r\nNicaragua’s problems, economic as well as political.\r\nThe national dialogue has to continue and must lead to\r\na concrete agreement, in particular on questions of\r\nownership and access to land, reform of the judicial system\r\nand transformation of the army and the police.\r\nThe parties in Nicaragua have a joint responsibility for\r\nsetting their country on a stable political and economic track.\r\nThis would be the best way to attract foreign cooperation.\r\nWe have previously stated that Sweden is prepared to\r\ntake part, together with the United Nations and other\r\nmembers of the international community, in international\r\nefforts to contribute to the finding of solutions to the serious\r\npolitical problems that are hampering Nicaragua’s\r\ndevelopment. This is, of course, subject to the existence of\r\nbroad support among the parties in Nicaragua for such an\r\nendeavour.\r\nIn spite of all the difficult issues that remain to be\r\nsolved, there are reasons for optimism as concerns\r\ndevelopments in Central America. Fortunately, the internal\r\nand regional problems that we see today can be approached\r\non their own terms now that our vision is no longer clouded\r\nby the perceptions of the cold-war era.\r\nPeace, reconciliation, democracy, justice, respect for\r\nhuman rights and economic development are at the top of\r\nthe agenda. It is not only the duty but also in the interest of\r\nthe international community to give its full support to the\r\nachievement of these goals in Central America.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to propose, if there is\r\nno objection, that the list of speakers in the debate on this\r\nitem be now closed.\r\n57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November l993 15\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. SOMAVIA (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the item before us\r\ntoday, \"The situation in Central America: procedures for the\r\nestablishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress in\r\nfashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment\" (A/48/586), points out in paragraph 2 that, for\r\na decade now, the United Nations has been assisting the\r\npeace process in Central America.\r\nThe report then goes on to remind us that the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Secretariat itself\r\nhave participated actively in that process, the success of\r\nwhich, according to the Economic Commission for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, led to a significant economic\r\nreactivation in 1992, owing to a great extent to internal\r\ndemand. The report adds:\r\n\"The transition from confrontation to consensus in\r\nintergovernmental relations has generated increased\r\ncooperation on a large number of issues. It has\r\nrekindled the thrust towards regional integration, with\r\nconcrete results particularly in the area of trade.\"\r\n(A/48/586, para. 5)\r\nThe report states also:\r\n\"The economic gains mentioned above must be\r\nconsolidated against a background of world recession,\r\ndecline in the price of traditional exports and growing\r\ndifficulties for some export products to enter foreign\r\nmarkets.\" (A/48/586, para. 7)\r\nOn the other hand, the analysis before us recalls, too,\r\nthat:\r\n\"... many of the structural causes of the acute crisis\r\nsuffered in the 1980s are still present. Social disparities\r\nremain a source of tensions. With regard to health\r\ncare, housing, education and employment, the region’s\r\nindicators continue to be a cause for concern. Across\r\nthe region, extreme poverty has been on the increase in\r\nrecent years. In addition, new challenges have\r\nemerged, such as drug trafficking and environmental\r\ndegradation.\" (A/48/586, para. 7)\r\nThe report also notes:\r\n\"In that context, Central American Governments\r\nhave continued to stress the interrelationship between\r\nthe goals of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment.\" (A/48/586, para. 9)\r\nFor Chile, the action that has been carried out in recent\r\nyears by the Central American nations is truly exemplary.\r\nIt serves as an example of the ability to innovate in the face\r\nof difficulties that had appeared insurmountable; an example\r\nof how to develop new concepts of security; an example of\r\nhow to shoulder one’s own problems with imagination,\r\ncourage and resoluteness; and an example, too, of how\r\npeoples have been able to defend their political and human\r\nrights.\r\nThe Central American countries have been true leaders\r\nin the area of agreements for peace and political cooperation,\r\nand we should recognize that their attainments are no less\r\nimportant than the achievements in the Middle East and in\r\nSouth Africa. But these achievements require consolidation.\r\nThe situation is not easy and stability is still fragile, hence\r\nthe need for continued use of United Nations machinery at\r\nthis new stage in the quest for a strengthening of peace,\r\nfreedom, democracy and development - four terms that are\r\nsynonymous with what Central America sees as its own\r\ndestiny today. In this process, particular importance should\r\nbe attached, in our view, to the players and institutions of\r\ncivil society.\r\nAnother aspect of great importance to us is the fact that\r\nCentral America has continued to believe in the United\r\nNations, even at a time when - at the beginning of the 10\r\nyears of United Nations presence in the area, in a strictly\r\npolitical sense - the Organization was under scrutiny because\r\nof its apparent lack of effectiveness. With the determination\r\nof the usefulness of international action channeled through\r\nthe United Nations, the validity and force of our\r\nOrganization were demonstrated also. But demonstration of\r\nthis validity should continue above and beyond peace-\r\nkeeping operations, because - as we have so often reiterated\r\nin this forum when these topics are discussed at the United\r\nNations - there can be no peace without development, just as\r\nthere can be no development without peace.\r\nCentral America is an example that cannot be cast\r\naside. It cannot be ignored, because the best examples\r\ncannot be cast aside. It is precisely because there are\r\ndifficulties, obstacles and complexities - which have even\r\nrequired decisions by various United Nations bodies - that\r\nsupport must be reinforced. For this reason, the convening\r\nof a conference on peace and development in Central\r\nAmerica is of great importance. Both this conference and\r\nthe draft resolution (A/48/L.21), before us deserve our full\r\nsupport.\r\nThis Monday, there began, in Puntarenas, Costa Rica,\r\na Latin American meeting dealing with the social aspects of\r\nregional cooperation. Various bodies entrusted with\r\nprogrammes relating to development and social investments\r\nare meeting there, with the objective of strengthening a\r\n16 57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November 1993\r\ncontinent-wide network for the exchange of experiences on\r\nthese topics. Chile is participating in that exercise in the\r\nsame spirit as that in which it is making this statement: with\r\na deep commitment to working together within Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, and with the objective of\r\nkeeping alive the duty of international solidarity, of which\r\nCentral America has shown itself to be deserving.\r\nMy country has been developing, in so far as its means\r\npermit, a programme of cooperation with Central America.\r\nIn addition to our present participation in the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in El Salvador, we have since 1990 been\r\ncarrying out various projects within the framework of a\r\nrapprochement with an area to which Chile attaches\r\nparticular importance - not only because of historical ties but\r\nbecause, for us, this is not a case of solidarity with the\r\nproblems of others. Rather, it is an opportunity for support,\r\nbacking and commitment in a situation that is ours as well.\r\nConsistent with our sense of integration with Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, we accept wholly and\r\npermanently the realities of the region. Last week in San\r\nPedro Sula, Honduras, Chile and the countries of Central\r\nAmerica made a first general evaluation of this endeavour,\r\nwith very encouraging results.\r\nBut, above and beyond our individual contribution,\r\nwhich, as I have mentioned, is necessarily limited, we\r\nbelieve that the countries of the developed world and the\r\nmultilateral bodies must maintain their interest in Central\r\nAmerica, despite the internal problems the cooperating\r\ncountries are experiencing. We are aware that \"development\r\nfatigue\" is coming to be felt in certain parts of the developed\r\nworld, but we believe that it is possible to optimize the use\r\nof resources and carry out efforts to achieve greater\r\nefficiency. None the less, the most important thing is to\r\nunderstand that the Governments and the civil societies of\r\nthe Central American countries cannot do everything on their\r\nown. They have already made great sacrifices, and they\r\ndeserve an integrated response from the international\r\ncommunity. That is the political meaning of what we are\r\ndiscussing here today in the General Assembly.\r\nIn that spirit, the Rio Group, at its meeting in Santiago,\r\nChile, some weeks ago lent support to a particular situation -\r\nthat of Nicaragua - in order to deal with the problems that\r\ncountry is facing at this juncture.\r\nI should like to conclude by pointing out that the\r\nprospects for Central America to become definitively a zone\r\nof peace, freedom, democracy and development are very\r\ngood. Let us not allow this opportunity to slip through our\r\nfingers.\r\nMr. CÁRDENAS (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation is pleased to participate in this\r\ndebate on the situation in Central America, to which we\r\nattach special importance. We have carefully analysed the\r\nreport (A/48/586) of the Secretary-General, and we share\r\nmany of its affirmations and conclusions.\r\nThe situation in the Central American region is, of\r\ncourse, no exception to the global trends emerging since the\r\nend of the cold war or to the concrete manifestations we\r\nhave seen in the world in the course of efforts to attain the\r\ngoals of peace, freedom, democracy and development. The\r\nquest for these interrelated goals will contribute to the\r\nconsolidation of well-being and stability in the region.\r\nThe international community must be aware that the\r\nCentral American region is emerging from a difficult period\r\nof internal conflicts and is entering a new stage of\r\ninstitutional reconstruction and economic development.\r\nHowever, the advancement of this process requires the\r\nsolidarity and cooperation of all other countries, which can\r\nguide the process while taking into account, inter alia, the\r\nfollowing urgent matters: the need for bilateral and\r\nmultilateral financial support able to stimulate investment\r\nand, in consequence, growth; the reduction, partial\r\nforgiveness and/or conversion of external debt; and the need\r\nto prevent the continued suffering of some countries of the\r\nregion because of the adverse consequences of protectionist\r\ncommercial policies, especially those that, with devastating\r\nresults, affect their traditional agricultural exports, hampering\r\nexports and disturbing the commercial flows of commodities.\r\nWe are referring, of course, to the same policies that the\r\nCairns Group has been denouncing during the lengthy\r\nUruguay Round of negotiations.\r\nIn the context of assistance for sustainable development,\r\nwe cannot ignore the fundamental importance of providing\r\nsuitable international cooperation in the processes of\r\ndemocratic consolidation and of continuously pouring in the\r\neconomic and technical assistance indispensable to facing\r\nand surmounting the trying sequels of violent conflicts.\r\nInternational responsibility does not stop, of course, at\r\nsettling crises of war, but must be shouldered, in peacetime,\r\nthrough the institutional, economic, social and cultural\r\nreconstruction of the countries involved.\r\nMy country is clearly committed to this philosophy, as\r\nit has shown in concrete fashion in peace processes; in such\r\nrecent initiatives as the signing of conventions for technical\r\ncooperation in the fields of human resources, agriculture,\r\nforest management, fishing, energy and, in particular, the\r\nrenegotiation of external public debt; and through its military\r\nand civilian participation in the peace-keeping operations of\r\nthe region. We have also made, and continue to make,\r\n57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November l993 17\r\nconcrete contributions in human rights, assistance in\r\nelections and related matters.\r\nIn this spirit we reaffirm our commitment to the Central\r\nAmerican region, whose peoples share such close bonds of\r\nfraternity with our own.\r\nMrs. JAGAN (Guyana): It is with a deep sense of\r\nsatisfaction that I take the opportunity to speak on agenda\r\nitem 40 - \"The situation in Central America: procedures for\r\nthe establishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress in\r\nfashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment\".\r\nI say this because it was but one short year ago that we\r\nin Guyana, after a period in which there were four rigged\r\nelections, experienced the return of participatory democracy,\r\nthrough the free expression of the will of the electorate. The\r\nresult of this was a change of government after 28 years.\r\nDemocracy has been an ideal which the people of Guyana\r\nand, no doubt, most people the world over cherish dearly.\r\nIt is therefore our sincere hope that the opportunity afforded\r\nto the Guyana electorate for free and fair elections can be\r\nafforded in other countries where people are still clamouring\r\nfor the right to self-determination and the right of a free\r\nexpression of choice in regular, transparent polls. Peace,\r\nfreedom, democracy and development are ideals cherished\r\nby all right-thinking men and women of the world.\r\nThe quest for democracy in Central America is\r\nqualitatively no different from that in other regions. We\r\nhave in recent years witnessed the organization and conduct\r\nof elections in countries such as Nicaragua and El Salvador.\r\nThese elections have been preceded by an elaborate plan of\r\nvoter education, voter registration and other measures taken\r\nfor the institutional strengthening of the whole democratic\r\nprocess. The role of the United Nations in this preparatory\r\nprocess must be highly commended. Its observer missions\r\nto monitor the actual conduct of the balloting and the\r\ncounting of the ballots have provided the additional element\r\nof international supervision, thereby further strengthening the\r\nexpression of the will of the people.\r\nIt remains the case, however, that the institutional\r\nstrengthening of the electoral process and the holding of\r\ndemocratic elections are not ends in and of themselves, but,\r\nrather, the underpinnings of a climate of confidence in which\r\nthe electorate can exist. We have seen, therefore, that there\r\nis still work to be done, both domestically and through\r\ninternational and regional organizations.\r\nOne way to promote peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment in Central America is the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL). This Mission\r\nhas served to create the objective conditions for enhancing\r\nthe prospects of economic and social development in that\r\ncountry. It has played a pivotal role in organizing and\r\nreinvigorating institutional mechanisms for the orderly\r\nconduct of the State’s internal affairs. Thus the civil\r\nadministrative structure - the police, the judiciary, the court\r\nsystem - have all been addressed in the interest of the\r\npreservation of democracy. The Government of Guyana was\r\npleased to be in a position to offer a small contingent of\r\nmembers of its police force to perform the role of Civilian\r\nPolice Monitors in El Salvador’s transition process.\r\nThe international community must be vigilant against\r\nany attempt, as evidenced by recent events in that country,\r\nto frustrate consolidation of democracy.\r\nI hasten to add that it would be unfortunate if we were\r\nto discuss the concepts of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment in Central America while confining our\r\ncomments to a single State. Peace and stability have a\r\nregional connotation as well as on international one. Indeed,\r\nin the past situations of internal political unrest and violence\r\nhave not gone unnoticed by the international community\r\nbecause of their potential threat to international tranquility.\r\nWe should therefore applaud the efforts to return El\r\nSalvador to the fold of democratic Central American States,\r\nwhile recognizing that more needs to be done internally and\r\nthat the precedents set by countries like Nicaragua are\r\nexemplary.\r\nThe Guyana delegation believes that the return to\r\nacceptable minimum standards of protection of human rights\r\nis essential to the return of peace and stability in Central\r\nAmerica. Access to the courts, the right to a fair trial and\r\nrecourse to the remedies of habeas corpus and amparo are\r\nparamount. Moreover, the establishment of measures for the\r\npromotion and protection of civil, political, economic, social\r\nand cultural rights is the sine qua non for the establishment\r\nof a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development.\r\nThe international community, and developing countries\r\nin particular, have agonized for years over the question of\r\nwhether democracy should of necessity precede development\r\nor whether development should be sustained while the\r\ndemocratic traditions of a State are either held in abeyance\r\nor otherwise lag behind comparative global norms. This\r\ndebate was in a sense circular, since the institution of\r\ndemocracy is a political concern while development is more\r\nof an economic concern. But in reality the two concepts are\r\ninextricably intertwined: an improvement in statistical\r\nindicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), in the\r\nabsence of political and social conditions which allow people\r\nto improve the quality of their lives in a holistic sense, is\r\nshort-lived if not counter-productive. The overwhelming\r\nbody of opinion now is that democracy and development\r\nenjoy a symbiotic relationship and that quality of life\r\n18 57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November 1993\r\nindicators can no longer solely be economic statistics but\r\nmust also reflect the fundamental rights and freedoms of the\r\nelectorate.\r\nWhile taking note of the qualitative improvement of\r\ndemocratic traditions not only in El Salvador, through the\r\nwork inter alia of ONUSAL, but also in Central America as\r\na whole, we must ensure that respect for human rights is\r\ncomplementary to economic and social development in order\r\nto achieve lasting and stable peace within the region. We in\r\nGuyana cherish these ideals, and we therefore pledge our\r\nsupport for their promotion, in the overall aim of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security. Consequently,\r\nthe Guyana delegation will support draft resolution\r\nA/48/L.21.\r\nMr. TELLO (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe Government of Mexico has been closely following\r\ndevelopments in Central America. Although the period of\r\nconflicts and confrontations seems finally to be behind us,\r\nwe must recognize that progress has been uneven. Important\r\nprogress has been made in adopting measures for dialogue\r\nand reconciliation. We can also note a strengthening of the\r\ninstitutional and democratic structures and a more dynamic\r\nevolution of the subregional process of harmonization and\r\ncooperation.\r\nAt the same time, new uncertainties and contradictions\r\nhave arisen. New challenges to the definitive consolidation\r\nof peace, reconciliation and development have been added to\r\nold but persistent problems. Today more than ever it is vital\r\nthat we redouble our efforts to realize the hope of the\r\nPresidents of the Central American countries that the region\r\nbecome one of peace, freedom, democracy and development.\r\nThe consolidation of a stable and lasting peace can be\r\nachieved only if there is progress in economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Peace and development are indissolubly\r\nlinked. Hence, political, institutional and democratic\r\nprogress must be accompanied by the capacity to raise the\r\nstandards and quality of life of the region’s inhabitants.\r\nI should now like to discuss the efforts made by the\r\nGovernment and the society of El Salvador to carry out the\r\nPeace Agreements. Various aspects of the process formally\r\ninitiated on 16 January 1992 have been implemented\r\nsatisfactorily, while in other areas problems and delays\r\nremain. We encourage the parties to continue working,\r\nthrough dialogue, towards fulfilling all the commitments.\r\nWe cannot but express our deep concern at the\r\nunfortunate acts of violence recently observed in El\r\nSalvador; they bring new uncertainties to the peace process.\r\nThe violence must be stopped and the facts relating to it\r\nfully brought to light.\r\nWe appeal to Salvadorian society to establish the\r\nconditions for carrying out the electoral process successfully.\r\nThis would be the beginning of a new stage in the history of\r\nEl Salvador. Hence, we are pleased at the signing, on\r\n5 November of this year, of the \"Commitment of Six\r\nPresidential Candidates to Peace and Stability in El\r\nSalvador\".\r\nThe holding of elections in March 1994, under\r\nONUSAL supervision, will be a decisive step in the process\r\nof consolidating peace. However, we must bear in mind that\r\nnational reconciliation will not be automatic. All sectors of\r\nSalvadorian society will have to work daily and continually\r\nto consolidate the peace process and to take firm steps\r\ntowards promoting economic development.\r\nWe should like to make special mention of ONUSAL,\r\na key operation in resolving the Salvadorian conflict and\r\nimplementing the Peace Agreements. We wish to express\r\ngreat appreciation for the difficult, painstaking work carried\r\nout by this Mission, which has carried out with dedication\r\nand efficiency the task entrusted to it by the Organization.\r\nWith respect to Guatemala, we note with satisfaction\r\nthe restoration of constitutional order there after the events\r\nof last May. The process of dialogue should be begun again\r\nas quickly as possible, and the negotiations should take fully\r\ninto account the progress achieved before the interruption of\r\nthe process.\r\nThe people of Nicaragua continue to face the enormous\r\nchallenge of national reconciliation. We are pleased with the\r\nagreement achieved on 21 August between the Government\r\nof Nicaragua, the National Opposition Union and the\r\nSandinista National Liberation Front, pledging the removal\r\nof all the obstacles to the achievement of institutional,\r\neconomic and social normalization.\r\nWe wish to stress once again the importance of\r\ninternational cooperation with Central America. The\r\ninternational community should continue to support the effort\r\nof the Central American countries to make progress towards\r\npeace and economic and social development.\r\nJust as there was no major problem in finding financing\r\nduring the years of armed conflict, the community of nations\r\nshould now respond, more generously still, to the challenge\r\nof strengthening peace in this region.\r\nMr. SIDOROV (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): The Russian Federation notes with\r\nsatisfaction that the positive trends in the Central American\r\nregion in the settlement of conflicts and crises and the\r\nelimination of tension are gathering momentum. It is\r\nobvious that the policy of national conciliation through\r\n57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November l993 19\r\ndialogue and negotiation designed to halt violence,\r\nstrengthen trust and cooperation, ensure respect for human\r\nrights, consolidate democratic institutions and create a civil\r\nsociety is yielding appreciable results.\r\nAs has been quite rightly pointed out in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the situation in Central America:\r\n\"The end of the cold war and the end of the armed\r\nconflicts which afflicted El Salvador and Nicaragua and\r\naffected the region as a whole during the 1980s have\r\ngenerated better prospects for the achievement of the\r\ngoals of peace, democratization, reconciliation,\r\ndevelopment and justice ...\" (A/48/586, para. 4).\r\nThe settlement in El Salvador has now entered the\r\ndelicate phase of preparations for elections, which are\r\ndesigned to be the culmination of the peace process. In this\r\ncontext, we share the profound concern expressed in the\r\nletter dated 3 November 1993 from the Secretary-General\r\naddressed to the President of the Security Council (S/26689),\r\nconcerning the situation regarding human rights in El\r\nSalvador and, in particular, politically motivated murders and\r\ndelays in the creation of a national civil police force and in\r\nthe implementation of the voter registration process. In the\r\npresidential statement dated 5 November 1993 (S/26695), the\r\nSecurity Council underlined the importance of full and\r\ntimely implementation of all the provisions of the Peace\r\nAccords. The Council expressed concern about delays in the\r\nresolution of a number of problems, particularly the phasing\r\nout of the National Police force and the full deployment of\r\nthe National Civil Police, the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of the Commission on the Truth, the\r\ntransfer of land and the carrying out of other reintegration\r\nprogrammes, which are essential for the development of a\r\nsolid framework and a new climate for the respect of human\r\nrights in El Salvador.\r\nWhile welcoming the agreements between the\r\nGovernment of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Martí\r\npara la Liberación Nacional (FMLN) with regard to\r\nacceleration of the implementation of the Peace Accords, we\r\nwould stress that the parties must do their utmost to ensure\r\nthe irreversibility of democratic reforms based on respect for\r\nhuman rights and the social and economic rebirth of the\r\ncountry with the active support of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThis task of consolidating peace on the basis of\r\ndemocracy and social and economic reforms is entirely in\r\nkeeping with the goals of the Central American process\r\nitself.\r\nRussia intends to continue to extend the necessary\r\nsupport to the work of the Secretary-General and of his\r\nrepresentatives, the United Nations Observer Mission in El\r\nSalvador, and is ready to cooperate constructively with the\r\nGovernment of El Salvador, the FMLN and all interested\r\ncountries in the interests of promoting peace and prosperity\r\nin that country.\r\nIt is our hope that an overall improvement in the\r\nsituation in the Central American region will have a positive\r\neffect on the situation in Guatemala. The fact that the\r\nefforts of the Guatemalan leadership have been stalled for so\r\nlong now - efforts designed to bring about a normalization\r\nof the situation in the country - gives ground for concern to\r\nus and to the whole international community. The\r\ncontinuation of the smouldering civil war in that country\r\ncould in certain circumstances carry with it the danger of\r\ndestabilization, not only for Guatemala, but for the whole\r\nregion.\r\nWe would also hope that influential circles in\r\nGuatemalan society will demonstrate maximum flexibility\r\nand readiness to search for mutually acceptable solutions and\r\nreasonable compromises. However, we would stress that,\r\ngiven the motivation and the political will on the part of the\r\nGuatemalans themselves, a considerable contribution to the\r\ncreation of favourable conditions for successful negotiations\r\ncould be provided by a more active tapping of the potential\r\nof the United Nations and the Organization of American\r\nStates, as well as of the accumulated wealth of experience in\r\novercoming crisis situations in the region. We support the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General in this area.\r\nWe note the importance of consistent implementation of\r\ndecisions of the Central American countries to convert\r\nCentral America into a region of peace, freedom, democracy\r\nand development. The Russian Federation, as a permanent\r\nmember of the Security Council and a permanent observer\r\nat the Organization of American States, is ready to continue\r\ncooperating constructively with the States of the region, both\r\nbilaterally and multilaterally, in order to promote a\r\nsuccessful resolution of the problems they face as well as the\r\ntotal normalization of the situation in the region.\r\nMrs. FRECHETTE (Canada) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Canada reaffirms its full support for the\r\nestablishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America\r\nbased on freedom, democracy and development. The\r\nregional peace process demonstrates the determination of\r\nCentral Americans, with the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity, to resolve the problems afflicting their region.\r\nCanada congratulates the Governments of the Central\r\nAmerican States, the United Nations and those Member\r\nStates whose efforts have brought about a negotiated\r\nsettlement of the civil conflicts in Nicaragua and El\r\nSalvador, and whose efforts are aimed at finding peaceful\r\nsolutions to the ongoing civil conflict in Guatemala.\r\n20 57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November 1993\r\nCanada welcomes the advances made in Central\r\nAmerica with a view to settling the political, social and\r\neconomic problems facing the region. We are optimistic that\r\nthe Central American Governments’ efforts to work together\r\nto face these challenges, and in particular their commitment\r\nto regional integration, will consolidate the progress already\r\nmade towards establishing peace in the region. Increasing\r\ncommunication, understanding and cooperation between the\r\nCentral American States are keys to strengthening the peace\r\nprocess. In this regard we note the summit meeting of the\r\nCentral American Presidents held at Guatemala City from 27\r\nto 29 October.\r\nIn El Salvador considerable progress has been made in\r\nimplementing the Peace Accords signed in 1992. In this\r\nregard we salute the efforts of all the parties in carrying out\r\nthe Accords. We should also like to pay a tribute to the\r\nimportant role the United Nations, through the United\r\nNations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL), has\r\nplayed and continues to play in the successful fulfilment of\r\nthis objective. We are disturbed, however, by the apparent\r\nresurgence of politically motivated violence and the delays\r\nin carrying out certain provisions of the Peace Accords. The\r\nCanadian Government welcomes remarks by both the\r\nSalvadorian Government and the Farabundo Martí National\r\nLiberation Front calling for renewed efforts to implement\r\nrapidly all the provisions of the Accords. We urge them to\r\nfulfil their obligations in this regard. It is especially\r\nimportant for the democratization process that all\r\nSalvadorians work together to ensure that the upcoming\r\nelectoral campaign and the national elections scheduled for\r\nspring 1994 are free and fair.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFour years after the negotiated settlement of its civil\r\nconflict, Nicaragua has worked hard to overcome the many\r\nobstacles to the establishment of peace, democracy and\r\ndevelopment. The international community is providing\r\nsignificant financial and political support for those efforts.\r\nHowever, the economic situation is difficult and the political\r\nenvironment troublesome. We were especially concerned\r\nthis year by the resort to violence and intimidation to\r\nachieve political ends by groups from both sides of the\r\npolitical spectrum. We welcome and fully support renewed\r\nefforts by President Chamorro to work towards political\r\nreconciliation in Nicaragua. While assistance from the\r\ninternational community can help, dialogue between political\r\ngroups in Nicaragua remains the basis for building political\r\nstability and establishing the right environment for future\r\nprosperity.\r\nEarlier this year the people of Guatemala, with\r\ninternational support, successfully defeated an attempt to\r\nthwart constitutional rule in their country, demonstrating a\r\ndesire for civil society based on the rule of law. However,\r\nCentral America’s oldest armed civil conflict continues\r\nunresolved. The Canadian Government calls upon the\r\nGovernment of Guatemala and the Guatemalan National\r\nRevolutionary Unity to resume the peace talks suspended\r\nthis May as soon as possible with a view to ending this\r\nharmful confrontation. To this end, Canada welcomes the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts, in the framework of his mandate\r\nof good offices, to arrange a preliminary meeting in the\r\ncoming weeks to establish the terms for the continuation of\r\nthe peace talks.\r\nThe international community has played an important\r\nrole in promoting peace in Central America. The United\r\nNations, the Organization of American States and individual\r\ncountries have all made significant contributions to help\r\nachieve peace, enhance democratic institutions and support\r\neconomic growth. In this regard we welcome the meeting\r\norganized yesterday in New York by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) on international assistance\r\nto the region. Canada has been part of this international\r\ninvolvement and remains fully engaged in efforts to build on\r\nthe advances already made. Despite the progress, however,\r\nthese advances are fragile. International involvement can\r\nonly complement the strength, resolve and courage of the\r\nGovernments and peoples of Central America themselves,\r\nwhich remain essential to ensuring that the progress already\r\nmade in establishing lasting peace and stability in the region\r\nis further strengthened.\r\nMr. HUSLID (Norway) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI take this opportunity to express my delegation’s\r\nappreciation for the Secretary-General’s lucid report\r\n(A/48/586) on the situation in Central America (A/48/586).\r\nThe report describes in a precise manner the peace process\r\nunder way and the efforts to establish a lasting democracy\r\nin Central America. The report is particularly useful in\r\nregard to the role the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity can play. My delegation has also taken note of\r\nthe widespread sentiment expressed at the International\r\nTechnical Meeting on Central America convened yesterday\r\nby the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\nthat there continues to be a strong need for active\r\nparticipation by the international community. It is in our\r\nopinion a positive aspect of the situation that the countries\r\nof Central America remain open to dialogue with the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe situation in Central America is not without\r\nencouraging signs of development. Years of conflict and\r\nmistrust have given way to agreements that have been signed\r\nand implemented, and democratic elections have become the\r\nrule rather than the exception. Nevertheless, the picture is\r\nstill not as clear and positive as one could wish. Certain\r\nincidents this year have given some cause for concern.\r\n57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November l993 21\r\nHowever, we maintain our hope that the positive\r\ndevelopments will continue. The reason for our guarded\r\noptimism is that we have witnessed agreements worked out\r\nby the national political forces in which their obvious mutual\r\ninterests are reasonably balanced. A clear understanding has\r\nemerged that true democracy must prevail and that an end\r\nmust be put to injustice.\r\nThe signature of the Peace Accords in El Salvador in\r\nJanuary 1992 initiated a fruitful process of peace-building in\r\nthat country - a process to which the United Nations has\r\ncontributed substantially. However, we have learned in\r\nrecent weeks with deep concern of several politically\r\nmotivated murders in El Salvador. A return to old practices\r\nin El Salvador could put the whole peace process in danger.\r\nIn order to maintain the positive trends it is important for\r\nState institutions to observe the laws scrupulously. They\r\nmust also demonstrate the authority and responsibility to\r\nensure fair and clean elections in March, with equal voting\r\nrights for all Salvadorians.\r\nThe United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador\r\n(ONUSAL) is an example of the new kind of peace-keeping\r\noperation, integrating both military and civil post-conflict\r\npeace-building. ONUSAL has an innovative aspect in the\r\nway in which it is monitoring the human rights situation, and\r\nthe experience that it is gaining may later prove useful in\r\nother conflict areas. Norway is pleased to have been able to\r\ntake part in this process through participation in ONUSAL\r\nand the training of the new national civilian police force.\r\nI turn to the question of Guatemala. Following the\r\nagreements of Oslo, Quéretaro and Mexico City, continuous\r\nefforts have been made to end the conflict in Guatemala\r\nthrough negotiations. The talks have been difficult and\r\ncomplex, but the parties involved have shown a constructive\r\nattitude. Unfortunately, these peace talks have been stalled\r\nsince the beginning of the year.\r\nIt is therefore encouraging that last week the\r\nGovernment of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria\r\nNacional Guatemalteca (URNG) requested the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to arrange a preliminary meeting between the two\r\nparties, to establish terms for continuing the peace talks. We\r\nbelieve that the Secretary-General and his staff have an\r\nexcellent basis for carrying out that task. They can build on\r\nthe experience acquired by the United Nations in the region,\r\nand the Secretary-General can suggest methods by which the\r\nUnited Nations, in cooperation with regional organizations,\r\ncould assist. My country pledges its full support for these\r\nefforts, by, inter alia, participation in the Group of Friends\r\nof Guatemala.\r\nThe human rights situation in Guatemala remains a\r\nsource of concern to us. There seems to be a need for more\r\nefficient processes of secure human rights for all sectors of\r\nthe population. It is the responsibility of the Government to\r\nsafeguard human rights. However, the international\r\ncommunity should be prepared to help, if requested. We\r\nhope that ways and means of improving the human rights\r\nsituation will be given the highest priority in renewed talks\r\nbetween the Government and the URNG.\r\nWith regard to the political process in Nicaragua, there\r\nis still a need for greater efforts to achieve a national\r\nconsensus. It is urgent that a more stable basis for\r\nconstructive talks between the President, the Frente\r\nSandinista de Liberación Nacional (FSLN) and the Unión\r\nNacional Opositora (UNO) be found. The dialogue has been\r\ndisrupted by violence, and some armed groups have still not\r\ndemobilized as agreed. However, only through political\r\ndialogue will it be possible to address the serious social and\r\neconomic problems facing Nicaragua. For the good of the\r\nnation, all parties must be prepared to compromise. The\r\ncurrent situation in the country is causing hardship and\r\ndisillusionment among the population.\r\nThe situation calls for renewed efforts by the\r\ninternational community to generate sustainable and healthy\r\neconomic development. Stable economic growth for the\r\nbenefit of the people can be achieved only in conditions of\r\npolitical stability, whose creation is the shared responsibility\r\nof all Nicaragua’s political forces. Such conditions are a\r\nprerequisite for long-term investment and lasting trade\r\nrelations, and they also make possible a more efficient use\r\nof development assistance. It must be stressed, however,\r\nthat development assistance by itself - without a propitious\r\npolitical climate - is not sufficient to guarantee improved\r\nliving conditions in the long run.\r\nNorway is prepared, financially and otherwise, to\r\nmaintain its support for the determined efforts of the\r\nGovernment of Nicaragua to secure peace and economic\r\ndevelopment, for the benefit of the people of that country.\r\nMr. LAING (Belize): Belize is happy to speak in\r\nsupport of the draft resolution sponsored by the other six\r\ncountries of Central America.\r\nThe draft resolution quite correctly deals organically\r\nwith the integrated issues of peace and reconciliation, the\r\nenvironment and sustainable development, the strengthening\r\nof democratic institutions, domestic tranquillity and\r\nnegotiations, international cooperation and the key principles\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. These are all\r\nconcerns of every Member of the Assembly, which will\r\nundoubtedly give the draft resolution consensus support.\r\nCertainly, it has the unreserved support of Belize, consistent\r\nwith my country’s long involvement with the organic\r\nproblems of the isthmus where Belize is located.\r\n22 57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November 1993\r\nIn the field of the prevention of epidemic and other\r\ndiseases, Belize services communities across the borders\r\nwith its neighbours. Belize, whose population is about\r\n200,000, has provided a safe haven for well over 20,000\r\nrefugees, even though it is an onerous burden. Of course,\r\nthe refugees are from Central America.\r\nAs noted in the Secretary-General’s report (A/48/586,\r\npara. 12), Belize has taken certain initiatives to establish a\r\nmeaningful regional dialogue on such pressing issues as\r\nnarcotic drugs. As a bastion of democracy, human rights\r\nand justice, Belize provides some comfort to peoples\r\nelsewhere who strive for fulfilment of the basic values for\r\nwhich the Organization stands. Above all, Belize is a full\r\npartner - we would hope a pivotal partner - in the exercise\r\nof building bridges between our other economic subregion,\r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and historical\r\nCentral America. This Central America-CARICOM forum\r\nis now widening the economic spaces of our two subregions,\r\nwhich are now searching together for a fuller life for their\r\npeoples.\r\nThis expansion and cooperation are due in no small\r\nmeasure to a recognition by Guatemala of the independence\r\nand sovereignty of Belize. As this recognition takes hold in\r\nthe body politic of Guatemala, we look forward to the rapid\r\nresolution of a difference which persists because of an\r\nunfortunate legacy from the past.\r\nThe nagging problems with which the Assembly deals\r\nare largely attributable to history. Under this rubric,\r\nsubjectivities get transmuted into plausible incipient\r\nobjectivities. We are therefore grateful that the new Central\r\nAmerican leaders are persons of wisdom and intellectual\r\nvigour. They eschew subjective historicity. As they\r\nreinvigorate democratic institutions and reduce violence they\r\ndemonstrate a refreshing modernity. As they put forward\r\nproposals such as a new organic model for security they\r\nshow that they wish Central America to regain its true,\r\nancient, natural order, the order of the indigenous peoples.\r\nBelize salutes this new leadership. As it does so, we\r\nmust state our eagerness to participate fully in these new\r\nspecial plans, these new international conferences and these\r\nnew initiatives. In all of them, Belize will willingly, and\r\ngratefully receive its fair share as a good neighbour. At the\r\nsame time, good friends and neighbours in Central America\r\ncontinue to expect from Belize at least as much as it\r\nreceives, to the greater glory of the Caribbean and of Central\r\nAmerica.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nI should like to inform members that the Assembly will\r\ntake action on draft resolution A/48/L.21 on Monday, 22\r\nNovember, in the morning.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 7\r\nNOTIFICATION BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL\r\nUNDER ARTICLE 12, PARAGRAPH 2, OF THE\r\nCHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS: NOTE BY\r\nTHE SECRETARY-GENERAL (A/48/411 AND Add.1)\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: May I take it that the General\r\nAssembly takes note of document A/48/411 and Add.l.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n7?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 8 (continued)\r\nADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ORGANIZATION\r\nOF WORK: EIGHTH REPORT OF THE GENERAL\r\nCOMMITTEE (A/48/250/Add.7)\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I draw the attention of\r\nrepresentatives to the eighth report of the General\r\nCommittee, document A/48/250/Add.7, concerning requests\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General for the inclusion in the\r\nagenda of two additional items, as well as a request\r\nsubmitted by Algeria for the inclusion in the agenda of an\r\nadditional item.\r\nIn paragraph 1 (a) of the report, the General Committee\r\nrecommends the inclusion in the agenda of the current\r\nsession of an additional item entitled \"Financing of the\r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda\".\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to include that\r\nadditional item in its agenda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: In paragraph 1 (b) of the report,\r\nthe General Committee also recommends to the Assembly\r\nthat this item should be allocated to the Fifth Committee.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly adopts this\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n57th meeting - Wednesday, 17 November l993 23\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Next I should like to draw the\r\nattention of representatives to paragraph 2 (a) of the report.\r\nThe General Committee recommends the inclusion in the\r\nagenda of the current session of an additional item, entitled\r\n\"Financing of the United Nations military liaison team in\r\nCambodia\".\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to include that\r\nadditional item in its agenda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: In paragraph 2 (b) of the report,\r\nthe General Committee also recommends that the item be\r\nallocated to the Fifth Committee.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves of this\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Chairman of the Fifth\r\nCommittee will be informed of the decisions just taken.\r\nNext, I should like to draw the attention of\r\nrepresentatives to paragraph 3 (a) of the report. The General\r\nCommittee recommends the inclusion in the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session of an additional item, entitled \"Emergency\r\naction to combat locust infestation in Africa\".\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to include that\r\nadditional item in its agenda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: In paragraph 3 (b) of the report,\r\nthe General Committee also recommends that the item be\r\nconsidered directly in plenary meeting.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly adopts that\r\nrecommendation of the General Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I also take it that, as\r\nrequested by the sponsor, the item should be considered by\r\nthe Assembly as soon as possible because of its urgent\r\ncharacter?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: It is my intention therefore to\r\nschedule this new item, which becomes item 175 of the\r\nagenda of the forty-eighth session, for consideration by the\r\nAssembly on Friday, 19 November, in the morning, as the\r\nfirst item, on the understanding that the agenda item will not\r\nbe debated and that the Assembly will have before it a draft\r\nresolution for consideration.\r\nThe meeting rose at l.10 p.m.\r\n"
