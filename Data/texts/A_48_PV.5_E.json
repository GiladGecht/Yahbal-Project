ALFREDO FELIX CRISTIANI-\r\nBURKARD, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL\r\nSALVADOR\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of El Salvador.\r\nMr. Alfredo Félix Cristiani-Burkard, President of the\r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations, His Excellency Mr. Alfredo Félix Cristiani-Burkard,\r\nthe President of the Republic of El Salvador, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident CRISTIANI-BURKARD (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is a great pleasure for us to salute your\r\nunanimous election, Sir, to preside over the General\r\nAssembly’s work at its forty-eighth session, especially since\r\nyou are a worthy representative of a sister country of our\r\nregion of Latin America and the Caribbean. Your opening\r\naddress, in which you presented your vision of the world,\r\nwas rich in ideas and insights into international reality. You\r\nurged that we commit ourselves to promoting the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charter in order to achieve a better\r\nworld, and you encouraged us to reflect on our\r\nresponsibilities as we strive to meet the global challenges\r\nfacing our peoples. Your address demonstrated your\r\nsensitivity and wisdom, which, added to your political and\r\ndiplomatic experience in multilateralism, will help us move\r\nforward to change as we endeavour to achieve the objectives\r\nof our Organization.\r\nWe should also like to express our appreciation to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, the former Foreign Minister\r\nof Bulgaria, for the successful manner in which he guided\r\nthe work of the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly and in particular for his efforts to bring about the\r\nrestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations system.\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86611 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.5\r\n6 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nWe also wish to join in the expressions of appreciation\r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\ndedication and hard work in leading our Organization. We\r\nonce again express our support for and confidence in him in\r\nhis difficult task of seeking international peace and security.\r\nFor the fifth year in a row we have come to this highest\r\ninternational forum, from which it has been our privilege to\r\ngive annual testimony to the progress of a process that,\r\nthough it is unfolding in a small developing country,\r\nrepresents one of the most complex and exemplary dynamic\r\nforces for peace in modern history.\r\nIn 1989, when we first came to speak to the world’s\r\nrepresentatives from this rostrum, the case of El Salvador\r\nwas just one more knot in the tangled web of problems left\r\nbehind by the sadly notorious cold war as it began\r\nunexpectedly to wind down. A few months earlier, we had\r\njust taken the reins of government with a great purpose born\r\nin the deepest part of our conscience: to do all that was\r\nhumanly possible to find a political solution to the\r\nSalvadorean conflict. That is how we expressed ourselves,\r\nwith a solemn promise, to the Salvadorean people on the\r\nfirst day of our Government. We reaffirmed it before the\r\nUnited Nations in September of that crucial year of 1989,\r\nonly a few weeks before the world witnessed the almost\r\nunbelievable dissolution of one of the greatest ideological-\r\nmilitary Powers on Earth. This led to a new era - difficult,\r\nbut also hopeful and promising, for all.\r\nIf we wish sincerely to interpret the history of our\r\ncountry, we must say that the peace process in El Salvador\r\nwas a search along various avenues that had been present in\r\nthe lives of the people of El Salvador ever since our nation\r\nwas born. Our peace process is not a mere expression of the\r\nneed to find a sensible and reasonable end to an unjust and\r\npainful war. In El Salvador, as in so many other countries\r\nwith a historical development similar to ours, peace is the\r\ngeneric name for age-old needs and aspirations, such as\r\nthose for democracy, democratic institutions, the rule of law,\r\npolitical freedoms and rights - in a word, the victory of\r\ncivilization over barbarism.\r\nThis helped us to understand, as our work for peace\r\nbegan, that it must be solid and enduring. Otherwise, we\r\nwould be making just another effort - like so many in our\r\npast - that would not rise above superficial means or lay the\r\ntrue foundations of the country’s political, social and\r\neconomic modernization. For us - and this is the aspect that\r\nhas enabled our process to succeed - peace is synonymous\r\nwith democracy.\r\nWe in El Salvador have been delighted to learn that,\r\nfrom varying perspectives of ideological and political\r\nthought, our peace process is considered exemplary. In this\r\nforum of nations, we should like to point to some of the\r\nfactors that, in our opinion, have allowed us to set that\r\nexample.\r\nFirst of all, we believe that the solution achieved is\r\nstrictly in keeping with the nature of the conflict. Given that\r\nit was a conflict with historical and social roots, its eruption\r\nwas eminently political, linked to the inadequacy and\r\ndysfunctioning of the traditional Salvadorean political system\r\nand the political-ideological confrontation of the super-\r\nPowers. The solution had to be political, without winners or\r\nlosers, and to aim at the creation of a new scenario involving\r\na system of pluralistic participation. The peace agreement\r\nis a plan of commitments to expanding, developing and\r\nguaranteeing democracy in El Salvador. That was what we\r\nneeded. That is why it was implemented in an irreversible\r\nmanner, despite momentary problems that were merely\r\nmishaps along the way.\r\nSecondly, the conflict led to violent confrontation in the\r\ncountry. The exhaustion from the war and the impetus\r\ntowards a process of democratization created the conditions\r\nfor the emergence in El Salvador of a culture of tolerance,\r\nunderstanding and reconciliation - in a word, a culture of\r\npeace. This concept has not emerged in El Salvador alone;\r\nit is a growing concern throughout the world. With the\r\nsupport of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization, we are striving to promote a culture\r\nof peace, for which we appeal for the firm support of the\r\ninternational community. Without a culture of peace, which\r\nwill help to remove the ever-active remnants of the culture\r\nof violence, it will be impossible to establish the new world\r\norder demanded by our times, a new moral order between\r\nmen and nations as the foundation for this new world order\r\nof competitive but respectful and harmonious coexistence,\r\nwhich we can glimpse as an achievable reality as we pass\r\ninto the new millennium.\r\nThirdly, we must recognize that the peace process in El\r\nSalvador was continually and effectively followed by the\r\ninternational community, represented by the Security Council\r\nand the Secretary-General of this great world Organization,\r\nby a group of countries that had close ties to the situation in\r\nEl Salvador in a variety of ways, and by a widespread\r\ngeneral interest in observing the ways and means used to\r\nresolve a conflict such as the one that afflicted El Salvador\r\nfor such a long time. We have no doubt that without this\r\ninternational attention a solution to the problem in El\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 3\r\nSalvador would have been much more difficult and\r\ncomplicated.\r\nEl Salvador is a living example of how the transition\r\nfrom a world dominated by a confrontational bipolarity to\r\none determined by the logic of specific situations is taking\r\nplace. We do not doubt for one instant that the engine of\r\nthe world process is changing: from abusive and heartless\r\nideology to pragmatic and ordered rationality. There have\r\nalways been many problems and conflicts in the world, but\r\nfor a long time the international drama seemed to be an\r\nincreasingly absorbing confrontation of ideologies. This\r\ndistortion, aggravated by the real problems that existed,\r\nimpeded their solution. It is true that since the cold war\r\npainful and cruel situations have erupted, such as the one\r\nnow experienced in the former Yugoslavia. But ideological,\r\nstrategic and geopolitical bipolarity artificially created some\r\nconflicts and stifled others, also artificially. Reality is, of\r\ncourse, a better guide than all the fantasies of the ideologies.\r\nWe in El Salvador do not speak of these matters with\r\nthe tranquillity of analysts or the scientific patience of\r\nacademicians. We speak of war because we have physically\r\nendured it. We speak of the worldwide ideological\r\nconfrontation because, during what we now know was its\r\nlast phase, El Salvador was one of its most intense\r\nbattlegrounds. And we also speak of peace because we are\r\nbuilding peace on the basis of an agreement of great\r\ninstitutional significance, conceived and structured to\r\nstrengthen democracy in El Salvador and throughout Central\r\nAmerica.\r\nWe have already expressed what this peace means to\r\nus. And now we would like to emphasize that we are well\r\naware that peace is a process. Being a process, it cannot be\r\nstatic, but must evolve. In this as well, El Salvador sets an\r\nexample. Countries such as ours were for long caught up in\r\nthe struggle between authoritarian stagnation and\r\nrevolutionary radicalism. This is a pivotal moment in\r\nhistory, because it is giving us all a lesson in the\r\npre-eminence of an ancient but under-valued concept:\r\nevolution. \"Everything changes,\" said the pre-Socratic\r\nphilosopher. But the natural rhythm of that change has\r\nalways been a kind of historical riddle. With many\r\ncertainties remaining, and in the healthy absence of the\r\nmagical formulas that have so tormented the world during\r\nour century, we are perhaps on the way to understanding that\r\nthe natural rhythm of change can also be summed in another\r\nclassic phrase: \"Without hurrying, but without pausing.\"\r\nWith evolution as our guide once again, we have no\r\nreason to hurry. The rhythm of transformation occurs in a\r\nway that cannot be resisted. We see this in the changing\r\ninternational, political and economic relations of our time.\r\nAn almost spontaneous restructuring has followed the\r\nremoval of so many straitjackets. And this restructuring has\r\nbrought to light what has always been most important: the\r\nreal problems. As the East-West conflict has disappeared,\r\nalmost no one speaks about the North-South conflict or\r\nalternative alignments, but the serious problems of\r\ninequality, critical poverty and dependence have not been\r\nresolved. They are still with us. And they are a challenge\r\nfor this new order which we are trying to create on a more\r\nrational and reasonable foundation.\r\nIn this new scenario, the United Nations has a central\r\nrole which was until recently unimaginable. The great\r\ndynamic of universal peace cannot be led by a single\r\ncountry, nor even by a privileged group of countries. The\r\ncooperation, understanding and support of all countries is\r\nneeded, as is an instrument which will make peace processes\r\nviable and monitor and support them. That instrument is\r\nthis Organization, and this special dimension of its work has\r\nexpanded and been emphasized in recent years. El Salvador\r\nhas the honour to have been one of the first countries to\r\nbenefit from the new United Nations system of peace-\r\nkeeping efforts. All the work of active mediation and then\r\nactive monitoring - unprecedented in international law -\r\nwhich the United Nations has been putting into practice in\r\nEl Salvador, is not some theoretical artifice, but an exercise\r\nderived from the necessities of a real situation. The dynamic\r\nof the Salvadorian process has shaped the role of the United\r\nNations in our country. We Salvadorians have learned much\r\nfrom our close relation with the world Organization, and we\r\nare sure that it too has learned very important lessons from\r\nits continuing participation in the achievement, maintenance\r\nand development of peace in El Salvador.\r\nOur view of the United Nations has been enriched as\r\nwe have shared with the world Organization the\r\nresponsibility of carrying out the peace plan in El Salvador.\r\nThus we understand more clearly that the United Nations is\r\nalso evolving. Its original form was a product of the end of\r\nthe Second World War; it must now open itself up to new\r\nrealities. Organs, such as the Security Council, and even the\r\nSecretary-General now have roles and responsibilities which\r\ndemand changes. The composition of the Council and the\r\nveto mechanism within it, which were a result of the deep\r\nmutual distrust of the post-war period, must be\r\nfundamentally revised to adopt them to times of cooperation\r\nand exchange. The Secretary-General’s field of activity\r\nshould also be reconsidered, because there is far more\r\nexecutive work to be done today than in the past. All these\r\nare unavoidable challenges that now face the Organization,\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nto which we owe so much and which we wish to see ever\r\nstronger and more efficient.\r\nThe United Nations has room for the whole world. In\r\nsuccessive addresses here, we have emphasized the\r\nimportance of the principle of universality. We understand\r\nthat this principle cannot in any way provide a means of\r\ninterfering in the internal affairs of States; at the same time\r\nwe believe that there are realities of today’s world that\r\ncannot be disregarded. We have therefore supported\r\nconsideration of exceptional situations, in keeping with the\r\nexperience with parallel representation of divided countries\r\nat the United Nations. It should be possible to resolve this\r\nmatter within the framework of understanding and openness\r\nthat now characterizes international relations.\r\nEl Salvador, for the first time in its history, is in the\r\nvigorous mainstream of modernization, a dynamic that\r\nconcerns all countries during these times of change. Our\r\ncontribution cannot be material, because we lack resources\r\nand wealth, but we have earned the capacity to speak with\r\nthe moral force of a people raising itself up from its own\r\nrubble with the unexpected serenity that results from\r\nprolonged suffering. If we in El Salvador can testify to\r\nanything, we can testify that it is possible to move from\r\nirrationality to the deliberate construction of historical\r\nrationality. In proceeding along this long path we need the\r\ninternational community’s political, moral and financial\r\nsupport, in keeping with the resolution that the General\r\nAssembly adopted last year for the reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment of El Salvador.\r\nWe must reincorporate ex-combatants in institutional\r\nand productive life through programmes such as the transfer\r\nof land for farming. Also, there are many new institutions\r\nemerging in our country, such as the civilian national police,\r\nwhich is one of the most ambitious experiments in public\r\nsecurity in the world. We need timely technical and\r\neconomic support to build the structures of peace more\r\nswiftly. We would like to be able to wipe from our minds\r\nthe discouraging evidence that it is easier to find the money\r\nfor war than for peace. The culture of peace - which is a\r\nworld-wide challenge - must also become evident in this\r\nfundamental change in priorities.\r\nWe are here for the last time because our presidential\r\nmandate comes to an end on 1 June 1994. It has been an\r\nimmense honour for us to come here every year to report on\r\nthe progress in a process that is of such great concern to the\r\npeople of El Salvador, and yet is also of such concern to\r\nCentral America and the international community because of\r\nits positive effects on regional stability.\r\nThe country that we are talking about today is very\r\ndifferent from the one that we were discussing in 1989, and\r\nthe important thing is that what is surprising in the\r\ndifference is how positive and how full of hope it is. The\r\ncredit is not ours. We did our work and exercised our will.\r\nThe credit goes to a people that, from being a footnote to\r\nhistory, has won, by dint of sacrifice, a place of honour in\r\nthis changing scene that we are seeing emerge at this close\r\nof the century.\r\nAll the political and social forces in El Salvador have\r\nworked together to bring about the emergence of the new\r\ncountry. The friendly countries that are closest to us by\r\nreason of history and geography can testify to this. We have\r\nmade a successful effort to bring order to our economy, and\r\nwe are laying the foundations for the continued constructive\r\nadvance of full democracy - political, economic, social and\r\ncultural.\r\nEl Salvador expresses its concern over the continued\r\nexistence of conflicts that are devastating some parts of the\r\nworld. The tragic cases of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of\r\nSomalia cause us great distress. However, we have\r\nconfidence in the force of reason, which always finds a way\r\nto achieve even the most difficult goals.\r\nAnd there is good news too, such as the extraordinarily\r\nimportant agreement on mutual recognition between Israel\r\nand the Palestine Liberation Organization, which has thrilled\r\nthe world. We have also seen an opening up in South\r\nAfrica for reason to prevail, and the situation in Haiti\r\nbecoming clear, albeit with difficulty. All that gives us\r\ncomfort, and reminds us that we are in a period of enormous\r\nsurprises. The world is ridding itself of many oppressive\r\nspectres, and this gives us the strength to believe in the great\r\npotential of the international system.\r\nIf we had to prepare a list of all those to whom we\r\nwould give thanks for their contribution to peace in El\r\nSalvador, we would always leave out a few, but we cannot\r\nfail to mention the extraordinary work carried out both by\r\nthe previous Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar,\r\nand the present Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, and also their body of collaborators and\r\nadvisers, without whose participation and support it is\r\nunlikely that we would have achieved the goal of putting\r\nEl Salvador on the road towards genuine peace. The\r\nSecurity Council has always been very mindful of the peace\r\nprocess in our country, and the Council’s active even-\r\nhandedness also deserves our highest praise.\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 5\r\nOn behalf of El Salvador, I give thanks to everyone.\r\nEl Salvador is a living example. We hope that we will\r\ncontinue to be an example of stability, respect for human\r\nrights, national concord and progress. We therefore call on\r\nthe world to give us its attention and support, and, most of\r\nall, we ask God to shed his light on El Salvador, on the\r\nUnited Nations and on all men and women of good faith on\r\nthis Earth of ours, which is a common inheritance that must\r\nbe shared by all mankind.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of El Salvador for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alfredo Félix Cristiani-Burkard, President of the\r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. JOAQUIM ALBERTO CHISSANO,\r\nPRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Mozambique.\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Mozambique, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident CHISSANO: It is with satisfaction that my\r\ndelegation and I would like to congratulate His Excellency\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, on his election as President\r\nof the forty-eighth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly. I wish him success in discharging his duties.\r\nMy delegation is available and ready to cooperate with him\r\nin the task of ensuring a successful conclusion to this\r\nsession’s deliberations.\r\nTo His Excellency Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria we extend\r\nour congratulations on the wonderful work he did as\r\nPresident of the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to address my\r\nspecial appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, the Secretary-General of our Organization, for his\r\nunflinching dedication in the search for solutions to the\r\nmany problems that affect humankind. I wish to reiterate\r\nour gratitude and appreciation for his personal commitment\r\nand dedication to the cause of peace and stability in my\r\ncountry.\r\nTo the new Member States which have just joined this\r\ngreat United Nations family we express our congratulations\r\nand our readiness to work with them to fulfil the objectives\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the Organization.\r\nWhen I last addressed the Assembly, in 1990, I had the\r\nopportunity to say that my Government had begun direct\r\nnegotiations with RENAMO with a view to putting an end\r\nto the long war of destruction and destabilization.\r\nFor my Government the dialogue had as it main\r\nobjective - besides ending the war - to restore peace,\r\nnormalize life and promote understanding among all citizens\r\nof Mozambique. These conditions are essential if the\r\nprocess of national reconstruction is to gain root and prosper.\r\nIt is worth indicating here that, for reasons alien to the\r\nGovernment, the dialogue with RENAMO was complex and\r\ntoo long. We wish to express our appreciation and thanks\r\nto the international community for its unwavering support,\r\nwhich helped us to conclude the negotiations successfully\r\nand sign the General Peace Agreement in Rome on 4\r\nOctober 1992.\r\nFor Mozambique the signing of the General Peace\r\nAgreement represents an important step in the life of its\r\npeople. With it, hopes for the Mozambicans to rebuild their\r\ncountry in a peaceful and harmonious environment were\r\nrenewed. The fact that almost one year has elapsed without\r\nany major breach of the cease-fire is reason for joy.\r\nWe are witnessing the revival of economic and social\r\nactivity in the country. The refugees have begun to return.\r\nDisplaced people are resettling in their areas of origin or in\r\nother areas of their choice. The reconstruction of roads,\r\nbridges, schools and health centres is under way in spite of\r\nthe shortage of financial and material resources with which\r\nthe country is confronted.\r\nThe flow of people and goods is increasing as the roads\r\nare reopening to traffic. We are witnessing a normal\r\nmovement of people all over the country, except in\r\nRENAMO-occupied areas. There is a growing interest on\r\nthe part of foreigners in seeking investment opportunities in\r\nMozambique.\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe challenges ahead of us are enormous. The war of\r\ndestabilization that ravaged the country for more than 16\r\nyears has caused economic and social damage amounting to\r\nabout $20 billion. As a direct consequence of this war, 6\r\nmillion people were displaced or became refugees in\r\nneighbouring countries; more than 500,000 children became\r\norphans and an equal number were traumatized. In addition\r\nto this, 3000 primary schools and about 1000 health centres\r\nwere destroyed in rural areas. Together with this, power\r\nlines, sugar plants, tea factories - among others - bridges and\r\nmines were destroyed.\r\nMany agricultural and industrial activities of primary\r\nimportance were paralysed, thus reducing considerably our\r\ncapacity to export. Unemployment was aggravated. These\r\nare the problems we are endeavouring to solve as we\r\nproceed with the implementation of the General Peace\r\nAgreement. The demobilization of forces and their\r\neconomic and social reintegration require a tremendous\r\neffort on our part. As can be seen, these challenges cannot\r\nbe met successfully without the support of the Assembly.\r\nThe Government of Mozambique has approved a\r\nnational reconstruction plan the main objective of which is\r\nto reactivate the economic and social life of the population\r\nso that people may go from a situation in which they survive\r\non emergency aid to one of rehabilitation and sustained\r\ndevelopment. Thus, the aim of the plan is to put an end to\r\nthe structural poverty of the population by giving it the\r\nmeans it needs to relaunch productive activity and to become\r\nself-sufficient. We believe that in the medium term this plan\r\nwill contribute to a rapid expansion of essential services in\r\nrural areas as well as to that of overall economic and social\r\nactivity in the country in general.\r\nOn humanitarian assistance, it is worth noting that with\r\nthe support of the United Nations we drew up a consolidated\r\nprogramme for action in the repatriation process,\r\ndemobilization of military units, supply of emergency aid,\r\nre-establishment of essential services, and institutional\r\ncapacity-building in the country. Humanitarian assistance\r\nwill be required for some years to come until the whole\r\nprocess of resettlement of the population is completed.\r\nIn spite of these challenges the Government has\r\nproceeded with the implementation of the economic recovery\r\nprogramme, with the assistance of the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Economic\r\nCommunity (EEC) and other partners. After a decline in the\r\ngross domestic product last year we expect a slight growth\r\nof about 4 per cent this year thanks to peace and the good\r\nclimatic conditions we are enjoying in the country.\r\nWe are convinced that the success of present efforts\r\nand of the large national reconstruction plan will, to a great\r\nextent, depend on the creative spirit, determination and hard\r\nwork of all Mozambicans. On the other hand, the success\r\nof this same project will also depend on the generous\r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nWe appeal to our partners to provide timely assistance,\r\ninasmuch as the delays we are observing in delivering\r\nassistance already committed have, in many cases, been\r\npartly responsible for the weak performance of the economy,\r\nparticularly in the industrial sector.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to recognize and\r\nexpress our thanks to the United Nations, and to all those\r\ncountries that have contributed funds, resources and\r\npersonnel to the United Nations Operation in Mozambique\r\n(UNOMOZ). We equally thank them and the many non-\r\ngovernmental organizations that have been operating in the\r\ncountry for their assistance in successfully meeting these\r\nchallenges.\r\nWe have spoken about encouraging developments in\r\nMozambique. However, we regret to say that the other face\r\nof the situation in the country is a source of serious concern.\r\nAfter the international community succeeded in catching\r\nup with the initial delay in setting up the UNOMOZ\r\noperation, RENAMO found new pretexts to further protract\r\nand delay the implementation of the Peace Agreement. In\r\nits dilatory manoeuvres RENAMO is moving from\r\nprecondition to precondition, though many of the\r\npreconditions have nothing to do with the General Peace\r\nAgreement or are a blatant breach of it.\r\nFrom the very inception, RENAMO delayed sending\r\npersonnel to fill its positions in the commissions for the\r\nimplementation of the General Peace Agreement. At\r\npresent, RENAMO is stating reservations concerning\r\nSecurity Council resolution 863 (1993) on Mozambique, to\r\nwhich my Government fully subscribes. As members know,\r\nthat resolution calls, among other things, for urgent\r\nimplementation, without further preconditions, of the process\r\nof assembly and demobilization of forces and of beginning\r\nthe training of the new army.\r\nOn the consultations for the adoption of the draft\r\nelectoral law, RENAMO is raising difficulties that can\r\nhardly be understood, particularly with respect to the\r\ncomposition of the National Electoral Commission. The\r\norganization and holding of multiparty elections is a\r\nGovernment responsibility. The Government cannot excuse\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 7\r\nitself from that responsibility at a moment when the\r\nMozambicans and the international community as a whole\r\nare anxiously waiting to see the free and fair multiparty\r\nelections that are to be held not later than October 1994.\r\nWe cannot postpone the elections indefinitely. RENAMO\r\nmust be made to understand this. The Government will\r\ncontinue to engage in consultations, and will spare no effort\r\nto make sure that the elections are held at the proper time.\r\nThe overview we have just presented compels us to\r\nmake some observations on the situation in Angola and\r\nSouth Africa, given the affinities of the regional situation as\r\na whole. We are deeply concerned over the resumption of\r\nhostilities in Angola because they not only represent a\r\nserious threat to peace and to the future of the country but\r\nalso threaten to perpetuate tension and instability in the\r\nwhole region of southern Africa.\r\nWe continue to believe that compliance with the\r\nBicesse Accords, respect for the election results and the\r\nunconditional implementation of the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions constitute a valid platform in the efforts\r\ntowards a lasting peace in Angola. We are hopeful that\r\ndialogue will prevail in the search for the best solutions to\r\nthe conflict in Angola.\r\nWithin that context, my Government fully subscribes to\r\nSecurity Council resolution 864 (1993). Strict observance of\r\nthe spirit and letter of that resolution by UNITA is a\r\nfundamental condition for an end to the protracted and\r\ndevastating war which is responsible for the great suffering\r\nof the Angolan people today. We also believe that\r\ncompliance with that resolution will certainly lead to\r\nhumanitarian assistance being channelled to the people in\r\ngreatest need. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nreaffirm my Government’s readiness to cooperate with the\r\nUnited Nations in the implementation of that resolution.\r\nWe have followed with great interest the talks within\r\nthe framework of the Multiparty Negotiating Forum in South\r\nAfrica. We would like to commend the decision taken by\r\nthat organ, specifically regarding the creation of the\r\nTransitional Executive Council soon to be established as a\r\ndecisive step in preparing for the first multiracial elections\r\nin the country’s history.\r\nThe end of the apartheid system and the formation of\r\na democratically elected Government will greatly contribute\r\nto peace and stability in the region, thus enhancing the\r\nprospects for even more prosperous economic cooperation\r\nwithin the context of the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC). The peoples of southern Africa have\r\nhigh hopes for that organization of regional economic\r\nintegration as a special forum for harmonizing their\r\neconomic and social development programmes. The region\r\npossesses enormous economic potential yet to be explored,\r\nand continues to call for investment in order to become a\r\nviable, more competitive economic partner in the\r\ninternational arena.\r\nOn the Middle East, we welcome the signing of the\r\nagreement between the Israeli Government and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization in Washington on 13 September\r\n1993. This agreement constitutes a historic and important\r\nlandmark on the road to the solution of the issues in the\r\nMiddle East conflict.\r\nThe question of East Timor, whose people shared with\r\nMozambique a common colonial history, remains\r\nunresolved. We encourage the ongoing dialogue between\r\nPortugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, aimed at finding a solution that will safeguard the\r\nright of the Maubère people to self-determination.\r\nWe are also convinced that, through dialogue, the other\r\nconflicts still prevailing in Africa and other continents will\r\ncome to satisfactory solutions.\r\nThe world economy continues to be characterized by\r\nstagnant growth with an increasing disparity in development\r\nlevels. Various factors on the international scene led to this\r\nstate of affairs. External debt constitutes one of the main\r\nobstacles to the economic growth of developing countries.\r\nThe external debt burden is aggravated by the deteriorating\r\nprices of basic export goods and by weak foreign investment\r\nin productive areas which could have a positive impact on\r\nthe balance of payments and on domestic savings. We\r\nbelieve, therefore, that the international community should\r\npay special attention to the external debt of the developing\r\ncountries and take necessary, adequate measures aimed at\r\nfinding a definitive solution to this crisis.\r\nMoreover, we have noted a decline in financial\r\nassistance to the developing countries; such assistance is\r\nbeing diverted to other countries, in Europe, at the very time\r\nwhen we are experiencing a reduction in the flow of official\r\ndevelopment assistance. This affects the economies of low-\r\nincome countries.\r\nNotwithstanding the enormous efforts undertaken in the\r\nstructural-adjustment process during the last decade, the\r\neconomic and social situation in Africa remains very serious.\r\nThe real economic growth rate in African countries remains\r\nfar behind the population growth rates. Per capita income\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nand other development factors continue to decrease, and\r\nremain among the lowest in the world.\r\nIf the alarming economic situation I have described is\r\nnot addressed by the international community, and reversed,\r\nthe peace dividends resulting from the end of the cold war\r\nand from the progress of the democratic process world wide\r\nwill not benefit all the peoples of the world.\r\nIt is in this context that we support the efforts to\r\nproduce a solid consensus on a development agenda to the\r\nbenefit during this session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe also believe that a speedy conclusion of the\r\nUruguay Round of negotiations would contribute to a\r\nsolution of the problems relating to international trade that\r\naffect the world economy.\r\nWith regard to environment, the Republic of\r\nMozambique has established a National Commission for\r\nEnvironment to look after issues in this area. The\r\nimplementation of \"Agenda 21\" in Mozambique has a legal\r\nbasis within the Republic’s Constitution, which contains\r\nprovisions relating to the management of natural resources\r\nand environment in general. The National Commission for\r\nEnvironment is at present working on harmonizing measures\r\naimed at integrating environmental aspects into economic\r\nand social programmes, and it is also producing a National\r\nPlan for Environment Management, whose main objective is\r\nthe promotion of the country’s sustained development. In\r\norder to fulfil international obligations in this regard,\r\nMozambique is making the necessary preparations to adhere\r\nto the main international Conventions and other agreements\r\non environment.\r\nA brief appreciation of the international situation shows\r\nthat the era of bipolarity has given way to the beginning of\r\nan era characterized by dialogue in international cooperation,\r\nparticularly in joint efforts to face the problems affecting\r\npeace, international security and economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSolving the problems we face today requires the\r\npromotion of cooperative relations, based on\r\ninterdependence, complementarity and mutual benefit\r\nbetween nations.\r\nIn various parts of the world significant steps have been\r\ntaken bearing testimony to the prevailing political will for,\r\nand commitment to, political, economic and social\r\ndemocratization. However, these efforts are faced with\r\nsocial problems deriving from the institutional and economic\r\nfragility of the States involved. It is therefore imperative\r\nthat the international community take cognizance of these\r\ndifficulties and adopt measures in support of those efforts.\r\nThe new challenges we are facing today lead us to\r\nbelieve even more in the United Nations as the most\r\nprivileged forum for harmonizing the global interests of all\r\npeoples of the world, with the aim of fostering an\r\ninternational environment in conformity with the noble\r\nprinciples and objectives enshrined in its Charter.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to highlight the importance\r\nof peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance in the world,\r\nand especially in my own country. In this regard I appeal to\r\nMember States to redirect their efforts and resources in order\r\nto strengthen further the United Nations.\r\nTo this end, we should like to appeal to all Member\r\nStates to channel material and financial resources to the\r\nUnited Nations so that its role as the guardian of\r\ninternational peace and security may continue to be\r\nstrengthened.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nMozambique for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda Item 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nADDRESS BY HIS SERENE HIGHNESS PRINCE\r\nALBERT, CROWN PRINCE OF MONACO\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Serene Highness\r\nCrown Prince Albert of Monaco.\r\nHis Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert of Monaco\r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome His Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert of\r\nMonaco, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 9\r\nCROWN PRINCE ALBERT (interpretation from\r\nFrench): For me this is a very special occasion, for it is the\r\nfirst time I address, on behalf of my father, the Sovereign\r\nPrince of Monaco, and on behalf of my country, this\r\nprestigious world Assembly of the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI wish to tell members of the tremendous joy of all\r\nMonégasques and inhabitants of the Principality of Monaco\r\nwhen my country joined this great world Organization. I\r\nshould like to take the opportunity once again to thank the\r\nmembers of the Security Council and of the General\r\nAssembly for their favourable consideration of Monaco’s\r\napplication for membership of the Organization.\r\nI wish the Assembly every success in its work. A\r\nnumber of its agenda items are of particularly vital historic\r\nand political significance. The decisions we take will\r\nundoubtedly have far-reaching and long-term consequences\r\nfor the future of the world community.\r\nI wish also, to congratulate you, Sir, very sincerely and\r\nwarmly on your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly. My congratulations also go to the members of\r\nthe General Committee. I have no doubt that your skill and\r\nlengthy experience will enable our work to proceed under\r\nthe best possible conditions.\r\nLike all countries that put their trust in international law\r\nand cooperation, the Principality of Monaco, in its relations\r\nwith other countries, has always relied on respect for\r\ninternational norms and documents.\r\nIts Princes have always been fully aware of the fact that\r\nthe maintenance of peace necessarily entails respect for the\r\nsovereignty of States and the development of friendly\r\nrelations among peoples.\r\nPrince Albert I of Monaco, when he created the Peace\r\nInstitute at the end of the last century, was even then\r\ninspired by that philosophy, which led to the founding, in\r\n1919, of the League of Nations and, in 1945, of the United\r\nNations. On 5 February 1934 Prince Albert’s successor -\r\nPrince Louis II, who was profoundly touched by the\r\nhardship and suffering caused by the First World War - set\r\nup the Medical-Legal Commission of Monaco, whose sober\r\nreflection and work which continue today, gave inspiration\r\nto the drawing up of the 1949 Geneva Conventions of the\r\nInternational Red Cross.\r\nMy country’s commitment to peace is therefore a\r\ntradition of more than 100 years - a tradition observed by its\r\nPrinces, whose dynasty will shortly celebrate its 700th\r\nanniversary. It is also a political aspiration that has only\r\ngrown in strength with the passage of time. It will always\r\nbe adhered to with both conviction and determination in the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations.\r\nIn this spirit, I should like to refer in particular to a\r\nresolution of the International Olympic Committee, of which\r\nI am a member, which unanimously recommends observance\r\nof a long-standing tradition of the Olympic movement - the\r\nprinciple of the Olympic truce.\r\nThe Government of Monaco supports this initiative,\r\nwhich was signed and endorsed by the National Committees\r\nof 184 countries and was officially addressed to our\r\nSecretary-General on 9 February this year. An international\r\nyear of sport and the Olympic spirit would undoubtedly\r\nafford an opportunity to launch this project.\r\nPerhaps it is by constantly repeating certain initiatives\r\nof this nature - albeit modest ones - that we shall be able\r\ngradually to create the just and lasting peace to which we all\r\nso deeply aspire.\r\nDid we not, a few days ago, receive from the southern\r\nshores of the Mediterranean news giving us immense hope\r\nof peace? Though it may be tenuous, we are at one with\r\nthose who inspired it and with those who are today\r\nendeavouring to make it a success. It is our earnest wish\r\nthat they will succeed.\r\nPeace is not just the silence of guns. Indeed, there can\r\nbe no doubt that the establishment of genuine peace can flow\r\nonly from greater respect for justice, human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. For this very reason, the work and\r\nthe conclusions of the Vienna Conference on human rights\r\nwarrants our very close scrutiny.\r\nFinally, echoing a wish expressed by my father,\r\nPrince Rainier III, when he addressed the Earth Summit in\r\nRio de Janeiro, I should like to emphasize that the\r\nGovernment of Monaco has set for itself the priority of\r\nprotecting our environment, both natural and cultural, so that\r\nit may provide a healthy, enriching and balanced life for all.\r\nThe Principality has undertaken major efforts to combat, in\r\nparticular, all types of pollution that attack and contaminate\r\nthe Mediterranean.\r\nMy country is more than ever resolved to encourage all\r\ninitiatives in this area, including the establishment, on its\r\nown soil, of institutions dealing with coordination and the\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nadoption of a General Assembly resolution that would\r\nproclaim 1998 the international year of the seas and oceans.\r\nI should like, in conclusion, to reiterate that the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco - in full respect for the rule of law\r\nin domestic affairs and for treaties and law in the\r\ninternational order; having neither armed forces nor military\r\narsenals; and bearing no enmity to anyone at all - is fully\r\nprepared to assist the Organization in all its actions,\r\nundertaken sometimes with great difficulty, aimed at\r\nmaintaining and rebuilding peace.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I should like to thank His\r\nSerene Highness Crown Prince Albert of Monaco for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nHis Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert of Monaco\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nMr. MOUSSA (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): It\r\ngives me pleasure to convey to you, Sir, and to your friendly\r\ncountry my sincere congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I wish you every success in carrying out your\r\nresponsibilities in light of the current developments and\r\nchanges in the international situation.\r\nOn this occasion, I should also like to pay tribute to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the constructive\r\nefforts he made and the positive role he played as the\r\nPresident of the past session.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, reference has been made\r\nto a new age. The implications of this have given rise, not\r\nonly to hopes and aspirations, but also to caution and\r\napprehension. Although there was overall satisfaction that\r\nthe era of confrontation, the arms race and polarization had\r\ncome to an end, and while there was cause for hope that an\r\nera of justice, cooperation and disarmament was about to\r\ndawn, there has been grave concern over the great injustices\r\nthat we have witnessed in Bosnia; over the attempt at\r\npolitical suicide in Somalia; over the illogical and irrational\r\nwars in many parts of the world; and over the multiple\r\ncriteria used in addressing various problems.\r\nSide by side with concern, there has been increasing\r\ndespair and frustration over the continued deterioration of\r\neconomic conditions in most developing countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa. It must be acknowledged, however,\r\nthat international developments, judged fairly and considered\r\nclosely, are still in flux, and that the world situation is still\r\ndynamic. We truly hope that such dynamism is moving\r\ntowards the strengthening of the positive factors and the\r\nrectification of the negative ones, in order that the political\r\noutlook worldwide might change and that everyone might\r\nembrace the new world order with satisfaction and a will to\r\nparticipate rather than with despair and frustration.\r\nFortunately, this session begins amid increasing feelings\r\nof optimism in view of the ongoing progress towards a just\r\nsolution to the question of Palestine and of the steady\r\nprogress towards a solution to the problem of South Africa.\r\nAt the Israeli-Palestinian level, a major step has been\r\ntaken through mutual recognition by Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization. This means mutual recognition by\r\nthe two peoples of each other and mutual acceptance of the\r\nidea of coexistence with one another. This also opens the\r\ndoor to serious and substantive negotiations which would\r\nprovide an unprecedented opportunity to achieve a just\r\nsettlement to the problem that has cast its shadow on the\r\nMiddle East - indeed, on the whole world - since the end of\r\nthe Second World War.\r\nIf what has been achieved represents the first step\r\ntowards such a settlement, it will undoubtedly lead to the\r\nestablishment of a positive relationship that would deal with\r\nissues such as withdrawal, self-determination and refugees\r\nuntil the historic and comprehensive settlement between\r\nIsrael, Palestine and the Arabs is finalized. This may be the\r\nreal meaning behind the statement of the Israeli Prime\r\nMinister at the signing ceremony in Washington, D.C., when\r\nhe said: \"Enough\", and when he said that the time for peace\r\nhas come; and also of President Yasser Arafat’s statement\r\nthat the Palestine Liberation Organization has turned a new\r\nleaf in its relations with Israel. And God bless the memory\r\nof the late President Anwar El-Sadat, who said: \"No more\r\nwars\".\r\nSixteen years ago, Egypt made a breakthrough towards\r\nthe outer reaches of the future and shook off the shackles of\r\nthe status quo by realizing that wars neither create peace nor\r\nresolve conflicts and that only reason and dialogue provide\r\nthe effective means of tackling problems, no matter how\r\ninsurmountable or intractable they may seem. Peace was\r\ntherefore initiated by Egypt, a peace founded on the solid\r\nfoundation of respect for international legality and on the\r\nresultant responsibilities in a balanced manner that ensures\r\njustice for all.\r\nThe peace process initiated at the Madrid Conference\r\nin October 1991 is now bearing fruit after unrelenting\r\nefforts, and we are encouraged by the initial outcome we\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 11\r\nsaw recently on both the Palestinian-Israeli and the\r\nJordanian-Israeli tracks and look forward to similar results\r\non the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. Both countries rightly\r\ncall for complete withdrawal from their territories within a\r\ncontext based objectively on the principle of land for peace.\r\nIn order to put an end to the legacy of wars and enmity,\r\nEgypt, which has devoted a substantial part of its efforts to\r\nMiddle East issues, calls upon all the peoples of the region\r\nto look to the future and to reflect upon our relations in the\r\nperiod following the settlement of the conflict. It calls on\r\nthem to reflect upon the future of the region and its\r\ndevelopment to ensure optimum utilization of the ample\r\nexpertise available and optimal investment of the rich human\r\nresources at our disposal and of the valuable natural\r\nresources with which it has been endowed.\r\nEgypt calls on these peoples to reflect upon the most\r\nsuitable social contract for our region so that they might\r\nmaintain their respective unique, intrinsic characteristics and\r\nachieve harmony and integration among the region’s\r\ncommon elements, so that social and cultural stability may\r\nprevail and the region may achieve comprehensive cultural\r\nintegration in a genuine era of comprehensive integral peace.\r\nFinally, Egypt calls on the peoples of the region to\r\ndevelop a system of relations based on equal security, the\r\nnon-use of force, a balance of armaments and the elimination\r\nof all weapons of mass destruction in a context of\r\ntransparency and peaceful relations.\r\nIn the same vein, Egypt calls on all States in the\r\nMiddle East, and particularly on Israel, to accede to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to\r\ntake the necessary practical measures to prohibit and\r\nrenounce the possession, the use or the threat of use of\r\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons so that the Middle\r\nEast may become a zone free of these weapons as called for\r\nin President Hosni Mubarak’s initiative of April 1990. We\r\nconsider this to be an indispensable prerequisite for security\r\nand stability in the Middle East.\r\nMr. WALOSOWICZ (Poland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nSide by side with the considerable optimism generated\r\nby what has been achieved in the context of the Palestinian-\r\nIsraeli conflict, there has been progress in another area, that\r\nfor far too long has been a hotbed of serious historical and\r\ninternational conflict, namely, the conflict in South Africa,\r\nbetween a people calling for its rights to equality and\r\nfreedom and a regime that was based on repression and\r\napartheid. Egypt, an African state with an African people,\r\nfeels glad to see positive developments in South Africa, the\r\nmost important of which is the agreement on the formation\r\nof a transitional Executive Council that would lead towards\r\ndemocracy and equal rights. The Council consists of\r\nrepresentatives of majority as well as minority groups and\r\nwould work within a framework of cooperation, co-existence\r\nand understanding. Despite the many obstacles and the great\r\nchallenges that still lie ahead, the start has been encouraging\r\nand developments are promising. In this regard, we\r\nrecognize the role played by President De Klerk. We also\r\npay tribute to the role played by Nelson Mandela and his\r\ncompanions across the political spectrum in South Africa in\r\nturning a new leaf towards a common future.\r\nThe twenty-ninth African Summit Conference was held\r\nin Cairo last June. It gave the countries of the continent an\r\nopportunity to evaluate its progress on the thirtieth\r\nanniversary of the establishment of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU). The meeting produced the Cairo\r\nDeclaration, which reflected the imposing record of the\r\nstruggle of the peoples of the African continent over the past\r\nthree decades. The Declaration also put forward the member\r\nStates’ vision for the future and their conception of the\r\nmanner in which they may adapt to the successive and quick\r\ninternational changes in shaping their conditions and\r\nrelationships. The Cairo summit discussions established\r\nmany landmarks that would guide the direction of African\r\nactivities in the coming years. They noted the options\r\navailable to the continent and the challenges it has to face.\r\nThe continent has expressed its determination to eliminate\r\npoverty, desertification and indebtedness and to initiate a\r\ncomprehensive development process for its countries and\r\npeoples and to improve their economic and political\r\nconditions.\r\nDespite the numerous problems of Africa, the continent\r\nhas demonstrated that it is prepared to shoulder its\r\nresponsibilities in facing up to the challenges posed by those\r\nproblems. Most prominent among its decisions in this\r\nregard was the decision to establish an African machinery\r\nfor resolving disputes. In that regard, the African States are\r\nhave set forth a new mode of international cooperation and\r\ncollaboration in shouldering responsibilities, notwithstanding\r\nall the difficulties facing the continent because of its\r\ncontinued low share in the world gross national product and\r\nthe increasing cost of debt servicing. Such a situation,\r\nthough restraining the continent’s endeavors and weakening\r\nits capabilities, has not debilitated either its will or its\r\ndetermination.\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe Cairo Summit was an expression of a determined\r\nattitude towards the indispensable need to make a number of\r\nadjustments to African policies and plans. It showed that the\r\ntime has come to take the difficult decisions required to\r\nbridge the gap between Africa and the developed world -\r\nindeed, between Africa and many countries of the third\r\nworld itself.\r\nMention of Africa leads to a discussion of the\r\ndevelopments in the Horn of Africa. This is all the more\r\nimportant owing to the fact that the developments and\r\ninteractions in the Horn of Africa are closely related to the\r\nsecurity of the Middle East and of Africa in general. Hence,\r\nwe welcome the independence of Eritrea and its accession to\r\nmembership of the United Nations. We also express our\r\ndeep regret at the situation in Somalia. In this regard, Egypt\r\nis fully cooperating with the international community, which\r\nhas moved effectively to put an end to the famine that\r\nbeleaguered that country and to the armed conflicts that have\r\nshaken its very existence. In the meantime, Egypt\r\nsympathizes with the people of Somalia in their aspiration\r\nafter a secure future based on a national reconciliation that\r\nwill serve the interests and meets the aspirations of all the\r\nSomali people and not merely the ambitions of a certain\r\nleader or faction. As a result, immediately after being elected\r\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity, President\r\nHosni Mubarak, inspired by Egypt’s keen interest in the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions on the\r\nsituation in Somalia, coordinated efforts with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of\r\nthe OAU to create the climate that would make it possible\r\nto achieve continued progress in the efforts designed to\r\nenable that brotherly country to begin the reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation of its infrastructure and to permit its people -\r\ntorn by conflicts and dissension - to clear the debris of\r\ndiscord and to reunite. That can be done only by helping\r\nthe Somali people to achieve a comprehensive national\r\nreconciliation that would allow all its elements to express\r\ntheir will freely, without any repression or apprehension and\r\nwithout being blackmailed by power-seekers who instigate\r\npolicies of destruction and annihilation. This is a\r\nresponsibility that the Somali people, who fell prey to tribal\r\ndisputes and personal ambitions, must shoulder, and the time\r\nhas come to put an end to that situation from an exclusively\r\nnational perspective.\r\nMoving from Somalia to Angola where the situation\r\nhas been aggravated by UNITA’s disregard for the will of\r\nthe majority of the people, expressed in free elections, Egypt\r\ncalls for absolute support for Security Council resolution 864\r\n(1993) which was adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter,\r\nand which condemned UNITA and urged all States to refrain\r\nfrom providing any form of assistance to it until it respects\r\nthe provisions of the \"Acordos de Paz\" as well as the will of\r\nthe people of Angola and the resolutions of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAfrica’s problems are not confined to those of South\r\nAfrica, the Horn of Africa or Angola. They also extend to\r\nnumerous African States whether in the form of civil wars,\r\nsuch as the one in Liberia, with its impact on its neighbours,\r\nor in the form of internal political dissension, like that\r\nprevalent in many African States at the present time, in\r\naddition to all the development-related problems and the\r\npangs of democratization. Nevertheless, Africa is ready,\r\nwith determination and political will, to go beyond those\r\nproblems and to embrace the twenty-first century and, all\r\ntotal confidence, steadfastness and determination, to be an\r\nactive partner in the formulation of the desired new\r\ninternational order.\r\nI began by reviewing some of the positive\r\ndevelopments in international relations that gave us reason\r\nto look toward the future with hope. However, there have\r\nbeen other recent developments in the world which give rise\r\nto concerns and fears. Those developments have posed an\r\nessential question among a number of thinkers: What kind\r\nof a world order do we need, and would such an order,\r\nwhose foundations would be laid today, be an extension of\r\nthe past, with its notions and policies, but in some new form,\r\nor would it be a mere reflection of the present with all its\r\nimbalances, contradictions and double standards? Or, rather,\r\nwould it be a real and genuine development towards a future\r\nthat may take us into the twenty-first century?\r\nLiving in just peace and prevailing stability is the prime\r\ndemand, without which none of our aspirations will be\r\nattained. Peace is not a passive or abstract concept. It is the\r\nexpression of the active and conscious will of all countries\r\nand peoples, small or large, to manage the common life on\r\nthis planet, with all its peoples, entities and groupings,\r\naccording to commonly agreed principles, values and\r\nguidelines.\r\nCertain principles underlie our concept of living in\r\nconditions of peace and security, the most important of\r\nwhich are the following: first, respect and support for\r\ninternational legality to maintain the reverence for and\r\npredominance of the law we have all accepted; secondly, the\r\nprinciple of equal rights and obligations to relieve frustrated\r\npeoples and to encourage them to utilize their expertise and\r\nefforts in joint and integrated action for the benefit of all.\r\nAll men are required to abide by the same rules in their\r\ninternational relations and to have a balanced share in\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 13\r\nregional and international responsibilities within a framework\r\nthat gives priority to public interest.\r\nMr. Walosowicz (Poland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThirdly, the same standard should be applied in judging\r\nall cases that are similar in nature. The same provisions\r\nshould be applied on a universal basis without selectivity or\r\nbias to ensure stability and security, reward compliance and\r\npunish and deter those who breach the accepted norms of\r\ninternational legality.\r\nFourthly, the principle of peace for all in the context of\r\ncorresponding and balanced commitments should be\r\nrespected.\r\nFifthly, the right to development should be respected\r\nand joint assistance made to developing countries,\r\nparticularly to the least developed among them.\r\nRespect for these principles constitutes direct and active\r\nimplementation of the rules of international legality. It also\r\nrepresents a sincere response to the will of the international\r\ncommunity. Their violation would threaten our efforts to\r\nagree on a more just and humane international order and\r\nwould greatly harm the credibility and progress of such\r\nefforts.\r\nI have to state here in all frankness that Muslim\r\ncommunities, and many others, have witnessed the\r\nmanifestations of repression and bias in a number of\r\ninternational policies. This has become apparent in the\r\nhesitation and inconsistency witnessed in addressing the\r\nquestion of Bosnia and certain other issues. There is no\r\ndoubt that a great deal of the suspicions of the Muslim\r\nworld could have been dispelled if the Bosnian problem had\r\nbeen dealt with according to the established principles\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter relating to\r\naggression, occupation, war crimes and crimes committed\r\nagainst humanity. All of those crimes have been committed\r\nagainst the people of Bosnia. This will not be forgotten by\r\nthose who have witnessed that tragedy unfolding under their\r\nvery eyes, day in and day out. Instead of addressing the\r\nproblem in accordance with the principles of the Charter, the\r\nblockade has been tightened around the people of Bosnia and\r\nall manner of procrastination and stalling has prevailed.\r\nEgypt rejects this flagrant manipulation of the norms of\r\njustice. Such manipulation rewards the aggressor for his\r\naggression. Egypt rejects this gross breach of human rights.\r\nHow can anyone justify this hesitation in the face of Serb\r\naggression against Bosnia on the part of the international\r\ncommunity that stood against Iraq’s Government when it\r\ncommitted aggression against Kuwait? And if we approve\r\nthe demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait border, why do we allow\r\nthe Serbs to expand at the expense of the Bosnian people\r\nand their territorial rights?\r\nThe protraction of the Bosnian problem without a just\r\nsolution acceptable to its people weakens the credibility of\r\nmany international policies and developments. The only\r\npositive development in this regard may be the establishment\r\nof the International Tribunal for the prosecution of war\r\ncriminals who have practiced ethnic cleansing. These\r\nprosecutions should target those who advocate or condone\r\nsuch practices that bespeak cultural decadence and\r\ncriminality in those who perpetrate or advocate them.\r\nThe issue of human rights is one of the major questions\r\nthat face us. We in Egypt believe that the human rights\r\nissue is universal both in content and nature. When we deal\r\nwith this issue in Egypt, we look at it through the\r\nperspective of the cultural and historical heritage which is\r\npart of our national identity. We view it through our\r\ndeep-rooted history extending through the millennia; through\r\nour ancient Egyptian civilization; through our Islamic\r\ncivilization, which is deeply impressed upon our\r\nconsciousness; through our interaction with the\r\nMediterranean civilizations; and through the legacy of the\r\nages of renaissance and enlightenment in contemporary\r\nEurope, which have had their effect on philosophy and\r\nmodern thought in Egypt.\r\nThe essence of this interlocking and integrated cultural\r\nheritage is the assertion of the individual human being’s\r\nvalue, recognition of his role in working for revival and\r\nprogress, and upholding his right to freedom of thought and\r\ncreativity in line with Islam’s sound principles which uphold\r\nman’s personal and social freedom. Those principles\r\nmaintain a balance between rights and duties as well as\r\nbetween the individual and society, so that neither may\r\nencroach on the rights of the other and so that all may live\r\nwithin a framework of a meticulously formulated social\r\ncontract.\r\nAs we see it, the main aim of human rights is to protect\r\nthe real interests of the individual, his family and his\r\nhomeland, as well as his fundamental, essential and genuine\r\nright to live in safety and security. This is the primary right\r\nfrom which all other rights should emanate. All these rights\r\nmust be protected from those who try to violate or deny\r\nthem through terrorism or intimidation. All communities of\r\nthe world are now in the same struggle against terroristic\r\npractices, whether they emanate from racial chauvinism, the\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nradical right, doctrines of \"ethnic cleansing\" or religious\r\nfanaticism. All these doctrines follow practices that\r\nconstitute gross violations of human rights, and should be\r\ndefied.\r\nIn view of our firm stand in favour of safeguarding and\r\nmaintaining human rights - foremost of which is the right to\r\nlife and security - we are aware that real democracy is the\r\nbest guarantee of stability, security and social peace. All\r\npolitical freedoms and rights, individual or collective, will\r\nremain forever incomplete if they are not complemented by\r\neconomic, social and cultural rights. We believe that it is\r\nnot an overstatement to say that the right of the individual\r\nand of the community to development and economic and\r\npolitical progress is closely related with their political and\r\ncultural rights in general. They reinforce each other and\r\nneither can proceed on its own.\r\nOne of the challenges now facing us is the need to\r\ndemonstrate our collective ability to bring about a real\r\nchange in the world economic order that would transcend\r\nnarrow interests and considerations and rise to the level of\r\nreal world partnership in striving for sustainable\r\ndevelopment for all and the protection of our common\r\nenvironment. Such a challenge requires us frankly to\r\nexpress our views concerning current international\r\ndevelopments that give cause for concern with regard to the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe current world economic situation pivots on the\r\ncentrality of the decision-making process which remains in\r\nthe hands of the industrialized countries, with all that that\r\nentails with regard to the economies of developing countries.\r\nFurthermore, the current recession in the industrialized\r\ncountries is reflected directly in the depression and\r\nincreasing unemployment and poverty rates that plague the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThis situation is exacerbated by the protectionist\r\nmeasures put in place by rich countries in trying to face up\r\nto their economic problems. Developing countries find\r\nthemselves helpless before such measures. They can only\r\nplead and hope. And this takes place at a time when most\r\nof the developing countries are in the throes of implementing\r\nrigorous programmes of economic reform. As the\r\nliberalization of trade constitutes a fundamental resource for\r\ndevelopment in the case of the developing countries,\r\nprotectionism deprives those countries of the opportunity to\r\nreap the fruits of their agonized efforts in the area of\r\neconomic reform and liberalization and severely hampers the\r\nintegration of their economies in the world economy.\r\nSo far, we find nothing in the Uruguay Round of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations that augurs well for the future.\r\nToday, the developing countries find themselves\r\nmarginalized by side deals in which they do not participate.\r\nSuch deals are characterized by ambiguity rather than\r\ntransparency. They jeopardize the interests of developing\r\ncountries. On the other hand, the developments of the last\r\ntwo years have demonstrated that the international monetary\r\nsystem is no better than the trade system. Conflicting goals\r\nof monetary and macro-economic policies in industrialized\r\ncountries have led to a state of chaos in foreign exchange\r\nmarkets, destabilizing the world economic order, with all\r\nresultant adverse effects on developing economies.\r\nThe Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro was an important\r\nmilestone on the road of constructive dialogue between\r\nNorth and South for a world partnership to counter the\r\ndangers facing our planet. In spite of the meagre progress\r\nthat has been achieved in the implementation of the Rio\r\nresolutions, we still perceive a marked difference between\r\nthe perspectives of the developed and the developing\r\ncountries. The developed countries focus mainly on the\r\nsymptoms of the crisis, which represent a major threat to\r\ntheir life styles and their welfare, even though it was those\r\nvery countries which contributed to the deterioration of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nBy contrast, many developing countries continue to\r\nsuffer from environmental pollution for which other\r\ncountries are largely responsible. In their attempt to solve\r\nproblems of debt, declining commodity prices and trade\r\nbarriers as well as the problems of sustainable development\r\nand the requirements for environmental protection,\r\nGovernments found that they were facing a real impasse\r\nleading to low productivity and declining growth rates which\r\nin turn led to more poverty.\r\nIn the long run, the divergence between these two\r\nperspectives may hinder comprehensive world action to deal\r\nwith the world environmental crisis. In order to surmount\r\nthis dilemma, all parties are called upon to shoulder their\r\nresponsibility for lending credibility to and promoting the\r\nacceptance of the slogans of interdependence and world\r\npartnership.\r\nIn this regard, it is important to address an integral\r\naspect of the equation for achieving development and\r\npreserving the environment: the population problem, which\r\nthreatens both sides of that equation. We are all aware of\r\nthe extent of this problem, which completely absorbs the\r\nyields of development and will ensure the continued\r\ndestruction of the environment.\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 15\r\nThe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, which Cairo will host in September 1994,\r\nrepresents an opportune occasion for the international\r\ncommunity to address population issues from the appropriate\r\ndevelopmental perspective and from the perspective of their\r\nrelationship to issues of economic and social development.\r\nWe in Egypt, as the host country, shall exert every\r\neffort to ensure the success of this important conference, and\r\nwe are confident that its outcome will represent a sound\r\ncontext for international cooperation in the field of\r\npopulation and development.\r\nOur discussion of the conditions and circumstances of\r\nthe Third World leads us to a broader and more\r\ncomprehensive discussion of the political movements and\r\ngroupings with which the various developing countries are\r\nassociated, despite their different orientations and stages of\r\ndevelopment. It is high time for us to stop and ask\r\nourselves what these groupings have achieved and what can\r\nbe done to further their legitimate goals. We need to reflect\r\non this issue in a frank, constructive and objective manner.\r\nIt has become apparent that the challenges facing the\r\ndeveloping countries have changed substantially. We are on\r\nthe threshold of new international conditions and challenges\r\nwhich have different economic, political and security effects.\r\nIn Egypt, we have already begun to study this issue,\r\ntaking into consideration the positive and the negative effects\r\nof the past decades at the political, economic and social\r\nlevels in the Third World, and the implications for changing\r\npriorities and areas of concern. We have come to the\r\nfollowing conclusions:\r\nFirstly, the so-called Third World represents the\r\nmajority of the world population and the majority of world\r\ncountries. It has the major share in the production of\r\nprimary commodities, and it has vast market potential. This\r\nThird World is fully entitled to be a full-fledged partner in\r\nthe ongoing restructuring process at the world level.\r\nSecondly, in order to be able to do so, the Third World\r\nhas to mould a political collective will, and this can only be\r\nachieved through democratic open discussion between its\r\nStates.\r\nThirdly, this, in turn, can only be achieved through the\r\nestablishment of a political system or movement that would\r\ninclude all these States.\r\nFourthly, the ultimate aim should be dialogue,\r\nnegotiation and partnership within a framework of\r\ncooperation, collaboration and integration, rather than\r\nconfrontation or conflict.\r\nToday, I propose that the developing countries embark\r\non a dialogue aimed at establishing a grouping for the Third\r\nWorld, a grouping within which the developing countries\r\nwould deal with the political, economic and social aspects of\r\nvarious world issues, a grouping to coordinate their\r\npositions and shape their contribution towards the laying of\r\nthe foundations of the new world order which we hope will\r\nprevail during the 21st century.\r\nThe developments we have just reviewed, and the\r\nsuccessive changes we are witnessing, strengthen Egypt’s\r\nbelief in the pivotal role of the United Nations in managing\r\ninternational relations in line with the principles and\r\nprovisions of its Charter.\r\nEgypt attaches great importance to increasing the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations and preserving its\r\ncredibility. We are aware of the nature and number of the\r\nchallenges that face the international Organization, perhaps\r\nfor the first time. These urgent challenges were suddenly\r\npushed to the surface of international relations by historical\r\ndevelopments that were never imagined by the founding\r\nfathers or the drafters of the Charter. We all agree that the\r\nmomentum that characterized the past few years was so\r\npressing and rapid that there should be a comprehensive\r\nreview of the United Nations mechanisms and structure, if\r\nwe are serious in our effort to adjust the international will to\r\nthe facts of our age, and if we are eager to maintain the\r\ncredibility and effectiveness of the United Nations.\r\nIn this connection, and with reference to the envisaged\r\nstructural changes, I would like to state that Egypt, as one of\r\nthe States which took part in the formulation of the Charter,\r\nand as one of the founding states of the Organization, is\r\nmainly concerned with the continued presence of the United\r\nNations and its principles, message, prestige and credibility\r\nto serve the causes of international peace and security\r\nwithout interruption.\r\nNeedless to say, the burdens of the United Nations in\r\nthe post-cold war era are far greater than they were during\r\nthe cold war itself. If the collective will of the international\r\ncommunity agrees to make structural changes in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, for example, Egypt -\r\nwhich is undertaking an effective role within the\r\ninternational order in the formulation of regional and\r\ninternational relations and in establishing the concepts and\r\nprinciples on which we all agree, in addition to its\r\nparticipation in numerous peace-keeping operations on\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nseveral continents - has the right and the potential to\r\ncontribute in a responsible manner to the proposed\r\ninstitutional restructuring of the United Nations. Egypt has\r\nthe desire and determination to take part both in the process\r\nitself and in setting the standards and values to be used in\r\nthe process. Egypt believes that it has now gained the\r\nrequisite standing to be included within the framework of the\r\nongoing discussion and within the new membership.\r\nWe must open the doors to a better future in whose\r\ncreation all of us will participate to achieve the 21st century\r\nworld for which we hope. This is the time for collective\r\nformulation of a new solid and stable world order. This is\r\nthe great challenge that faces us all at a time of\r\nunprecedented opportunity.\r\nMr. BEN YAHIA (Tunisia) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): I am particularly pleased to offer my warm\r\ncongratulations to Ambassador Insanally, both on my own\r\nbehalf and on behalf of the Government of the Republic of\r\nTunisia, on his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am delighted to see\r\nhim directing our work and I am convinced that in the\r\nchoice it has made, the General Assembly intended to\r\nhonour his country, which has been devoted to the cause of\r\npeace and international cooperation.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the contribution he made\r\nto the work of the forty-seventh session and for the great\r\nskill he evinced at that time.\r\nIt is also a pleasant duty to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for\r\nhis efforts and the determination in implementing the\r\nobjectives and decisions of the United Nations aimed at\r\nresolving conflicts throughout the world. His is far from an\r\neasy task, particularly since those conflicts have multiplied\r\nand the activity and role of the United Nations today have\r\nincreased as well.\r\nI should also like to congratulate the new Member\r\nStates that have acceded recently to membership of our\r\nOrganization and to welcome their delegations here present.\r\nI am quite certain that they will make their own valuable\r\ncontributions to what is being done by the United Nations to\r\npromote peace and cooperation between nations.\r\nAfter the spectacular upheavals that the world has\r\nundergone, the current session provides us with a propitious\r\nopportunity to take a close look at the circumstances and the\r\nprospects offered by these changes and to consider ways and\r\nmeans of strengthening our Organization and its new fields\r\nof action, particularly on the basis of preventive diplomacy\r\nand on building relationships of trust and cooperation\r\nbetween States.\r\nStarting from 7 November 1987, Tunisia has been\r\nengaged in laying the foundations of a modern and advanced\r\nState capable of adapting to the changes that have taken\r\nplace and continue to take place in the world. Tunisia hopes\r\nthat after the era of dogmatism and ideology, the world will\r\nbe able to evince greater maturity by putting more vigour in\r\nstriving for cooperation between nations and solidarity\r\nbetween peoples.\r\nOne of the signs of such maturity is undoubtedly the\r\ndynamic peace process in the Middle East. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the premisses of peace in the Middle East which\r\nare now attracting the attention of the entire international\r\ncommunity are an indication that an end to decades of\r\nconfrontation, destruction and suffering is now in view.\r\nThe historic mutual recognition between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization and the declaration of\r\nprinciples relating to the occupied territories are all\r\nimportant signposts along the road towards recognition of the\r\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and are a cause\r\nfor hope that a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle\r\nEast is in the offing.\r\nTunisia, while welcoming these developments, would\r\nlike to voice the hope that Israel will show the necessary\r\ncourage to reach agreement with the Arab parties concerned\r\nin order to achieve a just and lasting peace that will\r\nguarantee that all the peoples of the region will live in\r\nsecurity and stability, and that in the place of strife and\r\nconflict there will be good-neighbourliness.\r\nDevoted as it is to the universal values of peace and\r\njustice, Tunisia will continue to endeavour to give impetus\r\nto this dynamic peace process in the Middle East with a\r\nview to undoing the knot of the crises and conflicts that\r\nbeset the world today.\r\nIn line with this stance, Tunisia has made a point of\r\nbeing associated with the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity and with the work of the United Nations in the\r\nservice of peace, security and stability.\r\nIt is in this context that we should view Tunisia’s\r\nparticipation in the operations involving supervision of the\r\nelections in Cambodia, despite the enormous difficulties that\r\nwere encountered.\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 17\r\nAlso, Tunisia recently responded to the United Nations\r\nappeal to take part in the Somali operation; unfortunately,\r\nthe situation seems to indicate that a return of peace in the\r\nshort term seems rather unlikely.\r\nTunisia also responded to the United Nations appeal to\r\nbe associated in United Nations efforts in the Western\r\nSahara, the purpose of which is to lay the groundwork for\r\nholding a referendum.\r\nRegarding the tragedy of the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Tunisia once again appeals to the conscience\r\nof the world to work determinedly towards seeking a just\r\nsettlement based on law and international legality rather than\r\non the basis of fait accompli politics, so that a swift end may\r\nbe put to this tragedy, particularly as winter is near.\r\nSince it remains faithful to its Arab and Islamic\r\nidentity, and since it also belongs to the Maghreb, Tunisia\r\nwill do everything it can to strengthen the ties of\r\nbrotherhood and cooperation in order to achieve our\r\nobjectives so that we may be able to realize the aspirations\r\nof our peoples of a better future. It is in this spirit that\r\nTunisia and Algeria have recently concluded an agreement\r\non the demarcation of the borders between our two fraternal\r\ncountries. The agreement will be deposited shortly with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn this context, we should like to express our sincere\r\nhope that all the problems in the Gulf region will be\r\nproperly and rationally resolved, including the boundary\r\ndisputes between Iraq and Kuwait and between the United\r\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and that this\r\nwill be achieved by peaceful means in line with existing\r\nagreements and the norms of international legality, in\r\nkeeping with the new spirit which now inspires international\r\nrelations as well as with the aspirations of our world after\r\npeace and stability in this particularly sensitive region.\r\nTunisia’s efforts on the Arab Maghreb’s level in its\r\ncapacity as current president of the Arab Maghreb Union\r\naim at creating the necessary conditions that would enable\r\nus to make progress in building the Maghreb and\r\nstrengthening its role in the international arena. Building the\r\nedifice of the Maghreb is part and parcel of the current\r\ndevelopment of international relations, which favours\r\nregional groupings. We for our part are doing everything we\r\ncan to ensure that the Arab Maghreb Union keeps pace with\r\nevents in a way that will make it possible to establish\r\nfruitful relations in the international context and more\r\nparticularly with the regional Arab, European and\r\nMediterranean groups so that, as a group it may serve as an\r\ninstrument of peace and cooperation and a bastion of\r\nsecurity and stability.\r\nThe dispute between Libya, a member of the Arab\r\nMaghreb Union and three Western countries is a source of\r\ndeep concern for us. Tunisia has worked hard within the\r\nMaghreb framework and at the Arab level to find a\r\nnegotiated and honourable settlement that would safeguard\r\nthe interests of all parties and spare the region the risk of\r\nany escalation of tension and instability.\r\nTunisia has always worked for strengthening peace and\r\ncooperation in Africa. It is our hope that in future Africa\r\nwill reap the beneficial side-effects of the profound\r\ninternational political and economic changes that have taken\r\nplace, so that it may devote its efforts to development.\r\nTunisia, which has welcomed the process of change in\r\nSouth Africa, and looks forward with optimism to seeing the\r\nApril 1994 elections restore this great African country to a\r\nplace worthy of its standing within the African family, calls\r\nupon all political parties to respect the agreement that has\r\nbeen concluded, and to implement it in good faith so that the\r\npeoples of Azania can see an end to racism and the advent\r\nof a new era of democracy.\r\nThe establishment, at the most recent Summit of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, of machinery for the\r\nmanagement and settlement of conflicts in Africa is also a\r\nsource of great satisfaction. In our view, this is evidence of\r\nthe determination of the African Heads of State to turn the\r\npage once and for all on wars and disputes and to embark\r\nupon a new era based on dialogue and fruitful cooperation.\r\nHenceforth, Africa will have to rely essentially on its\r\nown resources. However, it does need the support of the\r\ninternational community so that its efforts may succeed in\r\nachieving the goal of African development and African\r\nstability.\r\nAttention should be drawn to the suffering of many\r\nAfrican States as a result of upheavals and conflicts such as\r\nthose witnessed by Somalia, Liberia and Angola, which have\r\nnow become sources of major concern for the entire\r\ninternational community. The international community must\r\nnot remain unmoved by such events, which undermine whole\r\nStates and sap their potential. We believe that the\r\ninternational community is capable of contributing genuinely\r\nto national reconciliation in those countries, and that by so\r\ndoing it will make it possible to eliminate all the other\r\nsources of tension in the continent.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe profound changes in international relations have\r\nundoubtedly imparted a global dimension to the problems of\r\nthe world. International solidarity and cooperation in the\r\nnew shape they have taken, have become an absolute\r\nnecessity whether the issue in question has to do with the\r\nmaintenance of peace, disarmament, the upholding of human\r\nrights, or with addressing problems relating to the\r\nenvironment, demography and development.\r\nOn November 7th, Tunisia charted for itself an\r\nunswerving course in that area and boldly has taken several\r\ndecisive steps toward laying the foundations of a State that\r\nfunctions under the rule of law, through institutions that\r\nuphold fundamental freedoms. Thus the concepts and\r\nprinciples of human rights, freedom, pluralism, the rule of\r\nlaw and State institutions, have become constants on which\r\nall Tunisians unite around their President Ben Ali, in order\r\nto devote themselves to laying the foundations of our\r\nsociety.\r\nTunisia has spared no effort to ensure the success of the\r\nInternational Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, to\r\nfacilitate the successful elaboration of a common approach\r\nand to identify the appropriate machinery to ensure respect\r\nfor human rights.\r\nMy country remains convinced that development,\r\ncombatting poverty, the settlement of disputes that arise from\r\nforeign occupation, the elimination of racism and fanaticism,\r\nare all absolute imperatives in defending human rights of\r\npeople, ensuring the stability of States and enabling their\r\npeoples to progress.\r\nIn this respect, I should like to highlight one particular\r\nscourge namely the dangerous phenomenon of extremism\r\nand terrorism, especially that type of extremism which dons\r\nthe garb and mask of religion while, in spirit and action, it\r\nconstitutes a total negation of democracy and human rights.\r\nTunisia, which unmasked in time the doublespeak of\r\nthat type of extremism, has been able, through an overall\r\nstrategy of political, economic, cultural and social\r\nachievement, to contain this phenomenon and thwart its\r\ndesigns. Consequently, our country now enjoys safety,\r\nstability and continued progress.\r\nWe have listened with great attention to President\r\nWilliam Clinton when he spoke this morning of the risks\r\nwhich continue to threaten security and stability throughout\r\nthe world, particularly extremism - racial extremism above\r\nall - and religious extremism, which breed hatred and\r\nterrorism. Tunisia continues to appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to intensify its efforts to contain this\r\nphenomenon which sows anarchy and chaos in the bosom of\r\nthe international community and hampers the development\r\nprocess.\r\nIt is high time for the international community as a\r\nwhole to give serious thought to this phenomenon, to define\r\nits various forms and manifestations and to devise an\r\ninternational course of action and a legal framework to\r\ncombat it. We should also look for just foundations that\r\nwould reinforce the laws of asylum now in force in all\r\nStates.\r\nIt is obvious that while the right of asylum acquires a\r\nhumanitarian character and is essentially a part of State\r\nsovereignty, the granting of asylum should be in accordance\r\nwith certain ethical rules and principles which must be\r\nrespected.\r\nTunisia believes that the right of asylum is one of those\r\ncommon human values which must not be used for the\r\npurposes other than those for which they were created.\r\nThe persistence of old problems and conflicts which\r\ndrag on in various parts of the world, delays in development\r\nwhich plague a considerable segment of mankind highlight\r\nthe fragility of peace and security. Consequently, it is\r\nessential to work for genuine disarmament. It was in\r\nkeeping with this thinking that Tunisia acceded to the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty, the Treaty banning the development of\r\nbiological weapons and signed, in January 1993, in Paris, the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their\r\nDestruction.\r\nI hardly need to recall that the concept of security\r\ntranscends the purely military aspects and embraces various\r\nelements that encompass political stability and economic\r\nsecurity. This means we have to draw up an agenda for\r\ndevelopment as a necessary prerequisite for the success of\r\nAn Agenda for Peace.\r\nThe right of both present and future generations to live\r\nin a healthy environment is today at the very centre of the\r\nconcerns of the international community and is one of the\r\nmain concerns of my country.\r\nTo this end, Tunisia adopts a policy that combines\r\npreventive and remedial environmental programmes. That\r\npolicy has yielded so far, many tangible results, in areas\r\nsuch as the conservation and safeguarding of natural\r\nresources, the protection of fisheries and coastlines, and the\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 19\r\nimprovement of the quality of life. Ratification of the\r\ninternational conventions which followed the Earth Summit\r\nand the creation of a national Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment are all tangible facts which reflect Tunisia’s\r\ncommitment to the implementation of the decisions of the\r\nRio de Janeiro Summit.\r\nIt goes without saying that steps taken at the national\r\nlevel can only be viable to the extent that the international\r\ncommunity succeeds in identifying the interrelationships\r\nbetween the problems of the environment and those of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn this connection, there is need for a new approach in\r\naddressing the issues of North-South relations. This means\r\nmoving towards strengthening of a multilateral economic\r\nsystem in order effectively to respond to the priorities of the\r\npoorer countries.\r\nTunisia has constantly given concrete expression to\r\ncooperation between the North and the South in its various\r\naspects because it is convinced of the interdependence of the\r\ninterests of the two groupings and the link between the\r\ngrowth and volume of assistance provided by the countries\r\nof the North. That is why it would be judicious to formulate\r\na new approach to international cooperation which would\r\nencompass development assistance, trade, investment and the\r\ntransfer of technology.\r\nTo avoid a North-South schism, the developed countries\r\nmust take account of the economic problems of the countries\r\nof the South, especially those problems that relate to the\r\ndevelopment process as well as the problems relating to the\r\nrestructuring of their economies and to indebtedness.\r\nWe cannot deal with international trade without taking\r\nup one vital question, namely the necessity of establishing a\r\nlink between the transfer of technology to the developing\r\ncountries and capital flows.\r\nIn this connection, it must be recalled that indebtedness\r\nand debt-servicing, in the case of the developing countries,\r\nin most cases is the main obstacle that impedes further\r\ndevelopment and hampers full participation in the world\r\neconomy.\r\nAlthough Tunisia has always honoured its financial\r\ncommitments I should like in this connection to reiterate\r\nsome proposals we made earlier on this subject: in\r\nparticular regarding the rescheduling of debt by creating a\r\nspecial fund to finance job-creating development projects.\r\nThere is no doubt that such projects, in addition to their\r\ndirect return which would be beneficial to the recipient\r\ncountries, will have the effect of settling populations in their\r\noriginal regions and thus contribute to reducing migratory\r\nflows to wealthier countries.\r\nIn this very Hall, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali\r\nproposed a contract for peace and development that in our\r\nestimation, would strengthen the existing capabilities and\r\nenhance potential in the States of the North and of the South\r\nalike.\r\nIn his recent address to the European Parliament at\r\nStrasbourg in June 1993, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali\r\nfurther proposed organizing a conference on the development\r\nof the Maghreb States with a view to establishing a new\r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural partnership between\r\nthe Maghreb and the European States.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to touch on the question of\r\nthe restructuring of the organs of the United Nations. I want\r\nagain to welcome the initiatives of Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali to adapt the universal Organization’s structures to the\r\nongoing changes in international relations, to rationalize the\r\nactivities of the United Nations system and to reorganize the\r\nmethods of its functioning. The elements of the proposed\r\nreform package should be carefully considered and discussed\r\nby all Member States with a view to making the\r\nOrganization’s new structure more efficacious.\r\nThe projected reforms - whether involving enlargement\r\nof the Security Council, redeployments in the Secretariat or\r\ncuts in spending - deserve our attention to the extent that\r\nthey take account of the interests of the developing\r\ncountries. We think the reforms should emphasize the\r\nprinciple of equality among Member States and guarantee\r\ndecision-making balance among the Organization’s various\r\norgans, and particularly with respect to the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating my wishes for the\r\nsuccess of the work of the forty-eighth session; we count on\r\nit to realize the hopes of the peoples of our world.\r\nADDRESS BY MRS. GRO HARLEM BRUNDTLAND,\r\nPRIME MINISTER OF THE KINGDOM OF NORWAY\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway.\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nMrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Norway, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway, Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland, and inviting her to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMrs. BRUNDTLAND (Norway): It gives me great\r\npleasure to congratulate Ambassador Insanally on his\r\nelection to the high office of President of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI should also like to welcome the new Members of our\r\nOrganization: Andorra, Eritrea, the Czech Republic,\r\nMonaco, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and\r\nSlovakia.\r\nThe historic and courageous breakthrough in the Middle\r\nEast tells us that even the deepest trench can be bridged.\r\nConflict has tormented that entire region for most of this\r\ncentury. It has brought super-Powers to the brink of war.\r\nIt has placed enormous burdens on the United Nations itself.\r\nIt has deprived families of their dear ones and held people\r\nunder the ominous spell of fear.\r\nNow we must seize the moment. Now we are at a\r\nturning point for the United Nations as well. Now we must\r\nanswer the clarion call and mobilize our collective political\r\nand financial resources to help move the peace process\r\nforward.\r\nThe time has come to let the divisive, acrimonious\r\nMiddle East debates and decisions of the past fade into\r\nhistory. Israeli and Palestinian leaders have made reality of\r\nthe seemingly impossible. We would fail abysmally in our\r\nduties should we falter now in our efforts to support the\r\nprocess of prying peace out of the knot of conflict, a process\r\nwhich men and women of vision have dared to think, dared\r\nto do.\r\nDue to our long-standing relations with the parties, both\r\nour friendship with Israeli leaders and the mutual trust we\r\nhave established with the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\n(PLO), Norway was privileged to contribute to these\r\ndefining dramatic events.\r\nIn this spirit, we shall go to Washington on 1 October,\r\ncommitted to help in building peace. For the peace process\r\nto succeed, it must be consolidated and stabilized by the\r\neconomic development the two parties have agreed to\r\nundertake together.\r\nThe fruits of peace must become tangible and real for\r\nthe women, men and children of Gaza and the West Bank.\r\nThe process of implementation could change the perspectives\r\nand expectations of the parties, convert interdependence into\r\na sense of community, and make possible solutions and\r\nvisions which today seem beyond reach.\r\nThe economic situation in Gaza and on the West Bank\r\nis dramatic and calls for immediate and extensive economic\r\naid. Now we must respond to the just but unfulfilled\r\naspirations of the Palestinians: for job opportunities and for\r\nschools, hospitals and universities. Now we must assist in\r\nbuilding houses, roads and water supplies, and make\r\nreconciliation pay, so that new generations of Israelis and\r\nPalestinians may grow up without fear, as good neighbours,\r\nin a life of dignity.\r\nA period of healing is needed in which all peace-loving\r\ncountries, the United Nations itself, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, other financial institutions and the European\r\nCommunity join financially - and substantially - in a\r\ncoordinated, immediate investment-for-peace programme. I\r\npledge and confirm that Norway’s assistance will be\r\nsubstantial and that we shall be honoured to play a\r\ncontinuing political role should the parties so desire.\r\nA period of renewal and change must also embrace\r\nSouth Africa and our relations with that country. South\r\nAfrica is in desperate need of peace and reconciliation.\r\nFixing a date for democratic elections in April next year is\r\na beacon of hope that the post-Apartheid system will finally\r\ngain the democratic legitimacy which the South African\r\nGovernment cannot claim today.\r\nUntil the day when black South Africans can enjoy the\r\nhuman rights of which they have been oppressively deprived,\r\nuntil the day when violence is ended and joint political\r\ncontrol has been established over the military and police\r\nforces, until that day South Africa will remain a country in\r\nimperative transition.\r\nThe outside world and the United Nations must, in\r\ntime, recognize the potential of post-apartheid South Africa -\r\nat peace with itself and endowed with immensely rich\r\nnatural and human resources - for the whole region of\r\nsouthern Africa. Education and training are needed for\r\ngenerations which are now ready to assume an equal role in\r\nthe economy of their country. We must now act forcefully,\r\nencouraging proponents of peace and transition, and\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 21\r\ndiscourage the shrill voices of hatred and interposition so\r\nthat one day - soon - the South African man and woman\r\nmay be free at last.\r\nWe must never lose hope that peace can be achieved.\r\nBut our hope has been severely tested by the protracted\r\natrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There seems to be no\r\nlimit to the brutality that human beings are capable of\r\nmobilizing in the service of a nationalistic goal. Such acts\r\nhave been committed in the name of a doctrine - the\r\ndoctrine of the ethnic state - and thus prolong the sinister\r\nexistence of doctrine as a source of war and contention in\r\nthis century.\r\nEthnic nationalism is a threat to peace and stability\r\neverywhere. The ethnic mosaic of Europe does not lend\r\nitself to such reduction. A doctrine of the ethnic state is a\r\nprescription for war. Our task is to build communities\r\nwhich include rather than exclude and to make all\r\nmulti-ethnic regions safe refuges of enlightened diversity.\r\nA military victory in which aggression appears to pay\r\nin Bosnia will be noted in those parts of the world where\r\ndifferent nationalities are sharing territory and political\r\norganization. In the former Soviet Union alone, ethnic\r\ntensions are reaching critical mass or have already erupted,\r\nas in Nagorny-Karabakh and Abkhazia.\r\nThe authority of the United Nations is seriously\r\nundermined if there is vacillation on where and how to use\r\nthe \"Blue Helmets\". We should admit that there have been\r\nfailures along the way and learn from experience. Our main\r\nthrust must be to aim for a negotiated solution based on\r\nknown elements. The alternative to a negotiated settlement\r\nis continued bloodshed. The alternative to peace is war.\r\nNorway fully supports the efforts of Thorvald Stoltenberg\r\nand David Owen. All parties must now cease hostilities and\r\nallow time for the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina to\r\nheal so that we can start slowly to build a foundation for\r\npeace. Let us be inspired by the Israelis and the\r\nPalestinians, and let us all send a message to the parties in\r\nBosnia: enough! Peace is possible.\r\nThe time for a settlement is long overdue. The\r\nsituation is already disastrous, and another winter of war is\r\nbound to take a severe toll of lives. Norway is among the\r\nmajor providers of humanitarian assistance to the area.\r\nInternational attention is focused on the terrible ordeal of the\r\nMuslims, but there are Croats and Serbs who suffer greatly\r\nas well. We should be even-handed in our humanitarian\r\nassistance, making a clear distinction between, on the one\r\nhand, warlords and war criminals and, on the other, those on\r\nall sides who are without a voice and without a choice, those\r\nwho are victimized and whose only hope is the assistance\r\nwe can provide from the outside.\r\nIt is absolutely imperative to improve on the\r\ncoordination and cooperation between United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations, United Nations humanitarian\r\nagencies and non-governmental humanitarian organizations.\r\nSomalia is an obvious case in point. For Norway it is a\r\npriority issue to move such coordination forward. We shall\r\nconvene a conference before the end of the year with the\r\naim of improving our capacity to organize real peace\r\noperations incorporating both humanitarian and military\r\ntasks.\r\nWe should all support our Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals for a necessary strengthening of the Department of\r\nPeace-keeping Operations. The management organization\r\nfor United Nations peace-keeping operations here in New\r\nYork is manifestly inadequate. The result is that troop-\r\ncontributing nations exercise direct control, which radically\r\nreduces coherence and effectiveness. The situation is\r\naggravated by the Security Council’s propensity to make\r\nambitious decisions but fail to provide the Secretariat with\r\nthe means to implement them. Failing to provide financial,\r\nhuman and technological resources undermines both peace\r\nand the authority of the United Nations.\r\nWe know what needs to be done. We must focus on\r\nthe following: There must be realistic mandates for new\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations whose goals and\r\nmeans must be clearly defined. We must have proper\r\nstand-by arrangements for troops and equipment from\r\nMember States, and Norway is prepared to contribute in\r\nconcrete terms to a collective stand-by effort. We need\r\nimproved training and analysis of past experience; our\r\ntraining facilities should be linked in a consortium for United\r\nNations peace-keeping training. There must be an\r\nimmediate and substantial increase in the United Nations\r\nreserve fund for peace-keeping; moreover, a unified peace--\r\nkeeping budget must be introduced which allows the\r\nSecretary-General to obligate at least 20 per cent of the\r\nestimated cost of peace-keeping operations once they have\r\nbeen approved by the Security Council. We need improved\r\nfinancing for peace-keeping operations and financial\r\ndiscipline among Member States.\r\nIndeed, the whole financial situation of the United\r\nNations is disgraceful. As the eighth-largest contributor to\r\nthe United Nations system in absolute terms and by far the\r\nlargest in per capita terms, we find it exceedingly difficult to\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nunderstand how so many countries fail to honour their\r\nobligations.\r\nThe Secretary-General has said that \"the Organization\r\nlives from hand to mouth.\" (Statement by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to the Fifth Committee, 26 August 1993). The\r\npermanent members of the Security Council have a special\r\nresponsibility. But we should also ask ourselves if countries\r\nshould be eligible at all for the Security Council if they have\r\nnot paid their contributions.\r\nThe post-cold-war patterns of risks and uncertainties\r\nhave brought about a wider recognition and understanding of\r\nthe need to address the serious economic and social\r\ninequalities in the world and their implications for global\r\nsecurity. Core issues such as environment and development\r\nused to be seen as side issues by the prime movers of\r\ninternational affairs. There is a new hope that this could be\r\nchanging.\r\nThe Secretary-General points out in his report that\r\nwithout sustainable development peace cannot long be\r\nmaintained and that political, social, educational and\r\nenvironmental factors must all be part of development.\r\nUnsustainable production and consumption patterns still\r\nprevail and can be counteracted only by changing how and\r\nin which fields our economies continue to grow. If current\r\nforms of development were employed, a further fivefold to\r\ntenfold boost in economic activity would be required over\r\nthe next 50 years to meet the needs and aspirations of 10\r\nbillion people.\r\nCurrently, the vast majority who are poor make only a\r\nminimal claim to our natural resources, while the more\r\nvoracious North is consuming in a few decades what it has\r\ntaken the planet billions of years to accumulate. The\r\nNorwegian Minister of the Environment raised the issue of\r\nproduction and consumption patterns in the industrial part of\r\nthe world at the first session of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development. Early next year Norway will host\r\na meeting on these issues as a contribution to the next\r\nsession of the Commission.\r\nThe rapid population growth in many parts of the world\r\nis a ticking time-bomb. Ninety per cent of this increase is\r\ntaking place in developing countries, many of which are\r\nunable to feed their present populations. We may soon be\r\nfacing new famine of a magnitude dwarfing even Malthus’\r\ngloomiest predictions. There may be mass migration and the\r\ndestabilization of countries and regions as people compete\r\nfor ever-scarcer land and water resources.\r\nThe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, to take place in Cairo in September 1994,\r\nmust address the complex root causes of the population\r\nexplosion.\r\nThe agreements reached at the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development in Rio last\r\nyear, however imperfect, set a sound, ambitious agenda for\r\naction to ensure sustainable development. Yet, I regret to\r\nsay, the momentum generated in Rio has been allowed to\r\nlose some of its force.\r\nThe world will not forget, and our children will long\r\nremember, that the industrialized countries committed\r\nthemselves in Rio to providing new and additional funding\r\nto combat climate change and safeguard biological diversity.\r\nSo far, however, contributions have been small-scale.\r\nThe aid fatigue continues despite enormous needs and\r\na more fertile ground for development in countries which\r\nhave made sacrifices and taken the bitter but crucial\r\nmedicine of structural adjustment, and despite the reduction\r\nof military budgets to levels where countries again should be\r\ndeemed creditworthy.\r\nFar, far more serious, and not only for the developing\r\nworld, is the gambling with the Uruguay Round holding the\r\nprospects of global free trade hostage to narrow national\r\ninterests. For most countries, strongly dependent as they are\r\non international trade, an agreement, even if each and every\r\nprovision may not be ideal, is absolutely necessary. I urge\r\nthe major parties to live up to the expectations created at the\r\nGroup of 7 meeting in Tokyo that before the end of the year\r\nthe deal will be closed.\r\nEnvironment and trade must be the next agenda item.\r\nWe should be more outspoken about conflicting interests and\r\nmore receptive to the fact that we do not have the option to\r\ngo our separate ways.\r\nWe must develop a sound, scientific basis for managing\r\nour natural resources in a sustainable way. In a politically,\r\nculturally and socially diverse world, science and knowledge\r\ncan be the only basis for sound and lasting cooperation in\r\nthis field.\r\nAnd while we reduce our strain on finite natural\r\nresources, the environmental agenda is constantly widened\r\nby the unveiling of the ecocide almost committed by the\r\nformer Communist countries.\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 23\r\nThe nuclear threat is not confined to that inherent in the\r\nremaining arsenals of nuclear weapons. Increasingly, our\r\nsecurity is threatened by the enormous deposits of nuclear\r\nwaste on land and at sea. Large-scale international\r\ncooperation is required to eliminate this threat.\r\nNuclear weapons have not disappeared, and the capacity\r\nto make them is broadly present. Proliferation of weapons\r\nof mass destruction and the means of their delivery\r\nconstitutes perhaps the greatest threat to international peace\r\nand stability. It is a matter of utmost priority to broaden and\r\ndeepen the non-proliferation regime to comprise a broader\r\npattern of commitments and cooperative behaviour. In this\r\nconnection, Norway urges the nuclear-weapon States to\r\nredouble their efforts to conclude a comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty. We expect that they will refrain from any testing\r\nwhile negotiations proceed. We also urge North Korea to\r\nsubmit fully to the safeguard regime of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency and to adhere to the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty.\r\nDevelopment without democracy and respect for human\r\nrights will never be sustainable. Democracy is indispensable\r\nfor promoting and upholding respect for human rights, for\r\nsocial and economic development, for peace and security,\r\nand for liberating the human creativity which is so vital to\r\nany social and economic development.\r\nI urge this Assembly to create the post of high\r\ncommissioner for human rights and to agree on a quantum\r\nleap in the allocation of resources for the United Nations\r\nhuman-rights activities. This is a modest price to pay for\r\nstrengthening the basis for peace and stability.\r\nThe lines between foreign and domestic policies have\r\nlong since vanished. Narrow-minded forms of nationalism\r\nwill not serve us. We must move towards an inclusive\r\nenlargement where the powerful are just and the weak\r\nsecure. Only the United Nations can provide the framework\r\nof a better-organized world, which today is too fragmented\r\nand uncoordinated. More and more causes are common, as,\r\nindeed, is our whole future.\r\nThe Middle East breakthrough gives us the hope that no\r\nchallenge is too difficult and the belief that we can make\r\nthis world a civilized place.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Norway for the statement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Norway, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nMr. EVANS (Australia): I warmly congratulate\r\nAmbassador Insanally, on his election as President of the\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly. As a fellow\r\nCommonwealth member with Guyana, Australia is very\r\npleased to serve in the Assembly under his presidency.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly will deal with a\r\nparticularly heavy and important agenda. It will do so at a\r\ntime when hopes for, and expectations of, the United\r\nNations have never been greater - but when, at the same\r\ntime, many doubts have been raised about the capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations system to cope. We will be relying very\r\nmuch, Mr. President, on your wisdom and your experience\r\nas you preside over our deliberations.\r\nMrs. Fritsche (Liechtenstein), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe world is a rather less happy place than we all\r\nhoped it would be after the end of the cold war. Economic\r\nand social deprivation continues to be a harsh daily reality\r\nfor many of our countries and our peoples. Not even the\r\nmost advanced countries are immune. The developed\r\nWestern economies are limping, with low growth rates,\r\nhistorically high unemployment rates, increasing disparities\r\nas a result between rich and poor, and a continuing inability\r\nso far to reach agreement - either between themselves or\r\nwith the rest of the world’s trading nations - about the\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade liberalization\r\nmeasures so necessary to give a new kick-start to world\r\ntrade and economic growth.\r\nIn the non-Western world, rates of growth have been\r\nextraordinarily uneven. The spectacular advance in some\r\nregions, in particular East Asia, has been in stark contrast to\r\nthe continuing terrible deprivation and poverty in others.\r\nSome States have simply been unable to cope with exploding\r\ninternal economic, political and social problems, and for all\r\npractical purposes have collapsed, leaving the international\r\ncommunity to respond, somehow, to the humanitarian crises\r\nthat have followed so often.\r\nIn security terms, the end of the cold war has seen the\r\nend of the super-Power nuclear-arms race and has relieved\r\nus of the immediate threat of nuclear devastation. We have\r\nseen major achievements in nuclear-arms reduction; and for\r\nthe first time in the history of the nuclear age a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, which would ban all nuclear\r\ntests in all environments for all time, seems within our\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nreach. We could help to make it even more so by adopting\r\nby consensus a resolution in this Assembly supporting the\r\nnegotiation of that treaty. A very great deal, of course,\r\ndepends on the current moratorium on all nuclear testing\r\nbeing maintained. We in Australia very strongly support\r\nwhat President Clinton said in that respect this morning.\r\nThis year we signed at last, after 20 years of\r\nnegotiation, the chemical weapons Convention. But much\r\nremains to be done to bring this and other instruments into\r\neffective operation. And there are still too many countries\r\nunwilling to submit themselves to the disciplines, more\r\nimportant and more necessary now than ever, of the nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty.\r\nThe threat of conflicts between States has certainly not\r\ndiminished with the end of the cold war. If anything, the\r\nremoval of the cold-war gridlock - the discipline imposed by\r\nthe super-Powers on each other and their respective\r\nsupporters - has created more room than ever for States to\r\nmanoeuvre. Some are beginning to do so, and some are\r\nbound to seek to do so in the future. Some of the emerging\r\neconomic Powers have yet to acquire political or military\r\nprofiles commensurate with their new wealth, and the\r\nprocess of adjustment certainly has ample potential to\r\ngenerate regional tensions. Should those tensions escalate\r\ninto conflict, the unhappy reality is that proliferation of more\r\nsophisticated conventional weapons and proliferation of the\r\ncapacity to develop weapons of mass destruction make any\r\nprospect of major regional conflict an alarming one for the\r\nworld as a whole.\r\nThe release of cold-war pressures has been associated\r\nwith another major new development of security concern\r\nwith which we are all now disturbingly familiar: the\r\nresurgence of ethno-nationalism, often taking a violent form.\r\nSome ethnic groups are being prepared to pursue their\r\nclaims for self-determination within the framework of\r\nexisting States, arguing essentially for minority human rights\r\nprotection - claims of right which, on first principles, we\r\nshould all be prepared to acknowledge and support. But\r\nmany other such groups have made clear that they will be\r\nsatisfied by nothing less than their nations becoming States,\r\ncausing the fragmentation of existing States in the process,\r\nand creating some very real dilemmas for the international\r\ncommunity as a result. Again, the proliferating availability\r\nof weaponry of every degree of sophistication has given a\r\nsharp new edge to these concerns.\r\nLooking out upon a world with all these characteristics,\r\nit is easy to be pessimistic and fatalistic. But I do not think\r\nwe should retreat into that habit of mind. For everything\r\nthat has gone wrong over the last few years, there is\r\nsomething else that has gone right. To match against the\r\nawful continuing tragedy in the former Yugoslavia, we have,\r\nfor example, this month’s peace agreement in the Middle\r\nEast - of course, only the first step in what remains a long\r\njourney, but an enormously encouraging one\r\nnotwithstanding. And to match against the continuing chaos\r\nand uncertainty in Somalia, and the at best very limited\r\nsuccess of the United Nations operation there, we have now\r\nthe unquestioned success of the United Nations operation in\r\nCambodia - and the end at last to more than 20 years of\r\nwhat has been a real twentieth-century tragedy involving\r\nbloody war, civil war, genocide, invasion and civil war\r\nagain.\r\nA terrible conflict continues in Angola, but peace is at\r\nhand at last in Mozambique; and in South Africa the final\r\ndeath of apartheid is imminent, as testified last week in this\r\nplace by Nelson Mandela. Military regimes have given way\r\nto democratic ones throughout Latin America. Many\r\nproblems remain to be solved in the former Soviet Union,\r\nbut Governments that can credibly claim to reflect the will\r\nof their peoples are in place throughout Central and Eastern\r\nEurope. The military regime in Myanmar, or Burma,\r\ncontinues to resist the obvious mood of its people for liberty\r\nand democracy, but elsewhere in the region traditionally\r\nmonolithic government structures - driven in many cases by\r\neconomic imperatives - are beginning to show signs of\r\nflexibility and responsiveness.\r\nBut while I do not believe that we should be unduly\r\npessimistic or fatalistic about the condition of the world\r\naround us, nor can we afford to be complacent. There is\r\nmuch more that we can and should be doing to reinforce and\r\nstrengthen the international community’s capacity to govern\r\nitself better, and in particular to better guarantee the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security in the post-cold-war\r\nworld. It is on this subject - the role of the United Nations\r\nand the international community generally in securing peace\r\nin the world of the 1990s and beyond that I want specifically\r\nto focus my remarks today.\r\nA little over a year ago, following a unique meeting of\r\nthe Security Council, Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali\r\npublished \"An Agenda for Peace\". It was and remains a\r\nremarkable document, one which poses most of the questions\r\nwe need to address if we are to have a fair chance of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security in the world of\r\ntoday and the foreseeable future. Since that time, a\r\nworldwide debate has taken place on the issues described in\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\", which has involved not only\r\nGovernments and officials, but has reached out to embrace\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 25\r\nuniversities, foundations, non-governmental organizations\r\nand many organs of the public media as well. This debate\r\ngenerated resolutions at the last session of the General\r\nAssembly, several worthwhile changes to some procedures\r\nand structures within the Secretariat, and the prospect of\r\nfurther changes to come.\r\nIt cannot be said, however, that the issues raised by\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" are now all settled, either in theory\r\nor in practice. We still do not have even a completely clear\r\nand consistent shared vocabulary to define the ways in which\r\nit is possible for the United Nations and other organs of the\r\ninternational community to respond to security problems:\r\n\"peacemaking\", for example, means different things still to\r\ndifferent people; so do \"preventive diplomacy\" and \"peace\r\nbuilding\"; the conceptual boundary between \"peace-keeping\"\r\non the one hand and \"peace enforcement\" on the other is not\r\ndrawn in the same way by everyone who uses these terms.\r\nNor do we seem yet to have clear and universal\r\nagreement even as to the kind of problems which justify a\r\nsecurity response by the international community. Should\r\nwe recognize, for example, a humanitarian right of\r\nintervention and, if so, in what circumstances and to what\r\nextent? When does an economic or social problem become\r\nthe kind of security problem which justifies the mobilization\r\nof the response strategies spelt out in Chapters VI and VII\r\nof the United Nations Charter?\r\nEven when it comes to applying a very familiar\r\nresponse to a new problem - for example, establishing a\r\npeace-keeping operation like the 30 which have now been\r\ninitiated since 1946 - there does not yet seem to have been\r\ndeveloped a commonly accepted check list of criteria to\r\nguide decision-makers in determining when precisely the\r\noperation should be set in train, how it should be structured,\r\nmanaged and resourced, or how long it should continue.\r\nEvery situation, of course, has its own characteristics, but is\r\nit really necessary for decisions on these matters by the\r\nSecurity Council or others to be made on so evidently ad\r\nhoc a basis?\r\nWhen it comes to thinking about how the United\r\nNations - and others in the international community,\r\nincluding regional organizations - might best be structured,\r\norganized, managed and funded to most effectively address\r\nthe international peace and security agenda, it is not clear to\r\nme that we have yet heard the last word in that debate.\r\nAn extraordinary amount has been achieved in the\r\ntumultuous period since 1989 in responding to the new\r\ndemands and challenges that have been unceasingly hurled\r\nat the United Nations, but a good deal more remains to be\r\ndone if the United Nations in particular, the only fully\r\nempowered body with global membership that we have, is\r\nto be as effective as we would all want it to be.\r\nIt is much easier, of course, to ask all these questions\r\nthan to answer them. Identifying problems is always easier\r\nthan defining acceptable solutions. But I believe that we all\r\nhave a responsibility to each other and the international\r\ncommunity to try to answer these questions and to keep on\r\nworking away at the answers until we find common ground.\r\nSo it is in that spirit that I put before the Assembly today a\r\ndetailed study of these questions, which tries to answer them\r\nin a way which might help us find a little more of that\r\ncommon ground.\r\nThe study, in the form of a book entitled Cooperating\r\nfor Peace, has been distributed, I hope, to delegations as I\r\nspeak. I do not pretend for a moment that this says the last\r\nword on any of the enormously complex and sensitive issues\r\nwith which it deals. It is simply an Australian contribution\r\nto the debate which was so thoughtfully and constructively\r\ninitiated by the Secretary-General last year.\r\nThe study seeks to do three things in particular. First,\r\nit suggests ways of bringing a little more clarity - to the\r\nextent this is presently lacking - into the concepts and\r\nvocabulary that we use in defining security problems,\r\ndefining possible responses and matching responses to\r\nproblems. Secondly, it suggests specific criteria that might\r\nbe applied by decision-makers in deciding what, if any,\r\nresponse is appropriate to a particular new security problem.\r\nAnd, thirdly, it suggests a priority list of areas in which\r\nfurther United Nations reform might usefully be pursued. In\r\nthe short time that remains to me I shall try to give a quick,\r\noutline sketch of what we are trying to say in each of these\r\nrespects.\r\nFirst of all, on the issue of concepts and terminology,\r\nit is perhaps worth making the point at the outset that this is\r\nnot just something for academics to wrangle about. It\r\nmatters in practice. If decision-makers do not share the\r\nsame basic way of looking at issues and the same basic\r\nvocabulary in defining them, there is a very real risk that\r\nthey will talk past each other - or, at the very least, find it\r\nvery much harder to produce responses which are timely,\r\nproperly graduated, effective in practice, affordable and\r\nbroadly consistent from one case to the next.\r\nJust as importantly, the choice of words can sometimes\r\nsignificantly influence the way in which we think about\r\nmatters of substance. To give just one example: If we use,\r\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nas many people still do, the expression \"peace-making\" to\r\ndescribe military enforcement action, then, simply because\r\nthis is such an innocuous and constructive sounding\r\nexpression, there is a danger that we may over time become\r\na little more relaxed than we should be about taking such\r\naction. It is much better, I suggest, to confine the expression\r\n\"peace-making\" to diplomatic-type activity to resolve conflict\r\nand to reserve the expression \"peace enforcement\" to\r\ndescribe the always dangerous, always messy, and what\r\nshould always be the last-resort, activity of applying military\r\nforce.\r\nIn the study we define security problems, in more or\r\nless escalating order of seriousness, as \"emerging threats\",\r\n\"disputes\", \"armed conflicts\" and \"other major security\r\ncrises.\" We make the point that security is not strictly or\r\nsolely a military concept and that threats to security, as\r\nmany speakers in the general debate have already said, can\r\nthese days come very much from factors such as exploding\r\npopulation pressures, environmental degradation, mass\r\ninvoluntary movements of people and the illicit narcotics\r\ntrade, among other things.\r\nEqually, we define possible responses to security\r\nproblems, again in escalating order of severity, in terms of\r\n\"peace- building,\" \"preventive diplomacy,\" \"preventive\r\ndeployment,\" \"peace- making,\" \"peace-keeping,\" \"sanctions\"\r\nand \"peace enforcement.\" We are at pains to emphasize that\r\nit is only as a last resort that security solutions should be\r\nseen as coming out of the barrel of a gun. We give much\r\nmore emphasis than has been common elsewhere to the\r\nconcept of \"peace-building,\" which we define in the study as\r\nextending not just to post-conflict economic development\r\nand institution-building strategies, but to a whole variety of\r\npreventive strategies, both within particular countries and in\r\nthe form of international treaty-type régimes addressing both\r\nmilitary and non-military threats to security.\r\nIn defining criteria for embarking on peace operations -\r\nwhether peace-keeping or peace enforcement - the most\r\ncrucial consideration is that there be a clearminded focus on\r\nthe objectives of the exercise and the likely effectiveness of\r\nthe operation in achieving those objectives. No operations\r\nof this kind should ever be embarked upon for the sake of\r\nbeing seen to be doing something. Although it is not always\r\npossible to analyse or predict with certainty, it should always\r\nbe possible to avoid embarking on operations which are\r\nmanifestly likely to be ineffective and which, as such, put at\r\nrisk the most crucial United Nations resource of all, its\r\ncredibility.\r\nIn the case of peace-keeping we suggest in Cooperating\r\nfor Peace that there are seven basic conditions for ensuring\r\nan effective operation: clear and achievable goals; adequate\r\nresources; close coordination of peace-keeping with any\r\nongoing peacemaking activity; a capacity to be and to be\r\nseen to be absolutely impartial as between the parties who\r\nhave been in conflict; a significant degree of local support\r\nfor the peace-keepers; evident support for the operation from\r\nexternal Powers that may have been involved previously in\r\nsupporting one side or the other; and a \"signposted exit\",\r\nthat is, a clearly designated termination point, or set of\r\ntermination criteria.\r\nWhen it comes to peace-enforcement operations, our\r\nsuggested criteria for determining involvement are quite\r\ncomplex and vary according to whether one is talking about\r\nan operation in response to cross-border aggression, as with\r\nIraq and Kuwait; about one in support of peace-keeping\r\noperations, the basic rationale for United Nations\r\ninvolvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina; or about peace\r\nenforcement in support of humanitarian objectives, as in\r\nSomalia. Without going into all the necessary detail now, I\r\nthink the basic considerations always come down to the\r\nfollowing: widespread international support; clear and\r\nachievable goals; adequate total resources to meet those\r\ngoals; and clearly defined termination or review points.\r\nIf the United Nations is to play with maximum\r\neffectiveness the central role it needs to play in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, then further change, further\r\nreform in the United Nations system, really is necessary.\r\nSome of that change is bound to be painful for some people,\r\nbut that is the way of change. Putting it simply and starkly:\r\nUnless the United Nations develops a comprehensive\r\ncapacity to address today’s and tomorrow’s problems - not\r\nyesterday’s - there is a very real risk of the United Nations\r\ngradually losing, with Governments and peoples around the\r\nworld, the credibility it needs to survive.\r\nIn the study we identify a number of priority areas for\r\nchange. The first is to restructure the Secretariat to ensure\r\nthat the Secretary-General has an effective chain of\r\ncommand exercising authority over major United Nations\r\noperations and to consolidate and coordinate in a more\r\norderly and manageable way the present sprawl of\r\ndepartments and agencies. We support the proposal that the\r\nSecretary-General create a new senior structure at United\r\nNations Headquarters under which he would have four\r\nDeputy Secretaries-General responsible, respectively, for\r\npeace and security, economic and social operations,\r\nhumanitarian operations and administration and management.\r\nEach such Deputy Secretary-General would have full\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 27\r\nexecutive responsibility for the operational issues falling\r\nwithin his or her portfolio, subject only to direction by the\r\nSecretary-General. This would be a big change, and it is not\r\nthe first time it has been proposed, but it is the one that,\r\nmore than anything else, would create the conditions for\r\nmore orderly and effective management throughout the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nThe second priority need is to resolve once and for all\r\nthe United Nations critical funding problem. Various\r\nadventurous ideas have been canvassed for external\r\nfunding - money coming from sources other than Member\r\nStates - and we suggest that at least one of those ideas,\r\nnamely, a small levy on international airline travel, be\r\nfurther explored. But overwhelmingly, of course, the\r\nproblem is one that has been created by Member States,\r\nincluding the richest of our number, and it is entirely within\r\nour ability to resolve by meeting our assessed contributions\r\nfor regular budgets and peace operations in full and on time.\r\nIt is an abuse of good management principles and of basic\r\ncommon sense to be forcing the Secretary-General to spend\r\nso much of his time pleading for debts to be honoured. In\r\nthat respect I echo the sentiments expressed a few minutes\r\nago by Mrs. Brundtland.\r\nIf the bulk of current arrears were to be paid by the end\r\nof this year, the United Nations finances would be in a quite\r\nhealthy position, with the Working Capital Fund, the Peace-\r\nkeeping Reserve Fund and the Special Account all\r\nreplenished and the Organization in a position to meet all\r\noutstanding troop-contribution costs.\r\nThe third priority is to improve the management of\r\npeace operations, both at Headquarters and in the field.\r\nSome very significant and useful steps have already been\r\ntaken in this regard in the context of the creation of the new\r\nDepartment of Peace-keeping Operations, but more remains\r\nto be done, including in particular the development over time\r\nof a properly constituted General Staff to plan and manage\r\nthe military dimensions of such operations.\r\nThe fourth priority is to give special attention to the\r\nmachinery of preventive diplomacy, again both at\r\nHeadquarters and in the field. These efforts have been\r\nlargely ad hoc in the past, although the Department of\r\nPolitical Affairs is gradually building a core of appropriate\r\nexpertise. Quite apart from anything else, there is an\r\noverwhelming cost advantage in doing more to stop disputes\r\nbecoming armed conflicts. We estimate the cost of keeping\r\n100 well-qualified, experienced practitioners of preventive\r\ndiplomacy in the field for a year to be $21 million; compare\r\nthat with this year’s peace operations budget of $3.7 billion -\r\nand compare it, moreover, with the $70 billion that it is\r\nestimated to have cost the United Nations coalition to fight\r\nthe six-week Gulf war.\r\nThe fifth priority is to rethink the whole system of\r\nhumanitarian relief coordination. Despite advances that have\r\nbeen made with the creation of the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, we think some basic structural\r\nproblems remain. We propose that they be addressed in a\r\nradical way by the creation of a new disaster-response\r\nagency, combining the relief and basic rehabilitation\r\nfunctions of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Food Programme\r\n(WFP), which would work in turn directly to the suggested\r\nDeputy Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.\r\nThe sixth priority, as we see it, is to take various steps\r\nto raise the profile within the United Nations system of\r\npeace-building. This is, after all, the point of intersection\r\nbetween the Organization’s peace and security role and its\r\neconomic and social role, and it should be given recognition\r\nand emphasis as such. The pursuit of peace and security has\r\nto include the satisfaction of basic human needs, as well as\r\nthe direct prevention, containment and settlement of armed\r\nconflict. Much of the United Nations system is in fact\r\nalready concerned with peace- building in the form of\r\nactivities such as international law-making, disarmament,\r\neconomic and social advancement, sustainable development,\r\ndemocratization and institution building. But much more\r\ncan be done, organizationally, to link these activities\r\ntogether, to recognize their security significance, and to\r\nensure that they are pursued with a sense of common\r\npurpose.\r\nThe remaining priority, a very large subject in itself, as\r\nwe all know, is to regenerate the Security Council - not\r\nbecause it is now working ineffectively, but because its\r\nmanifest lack of representativeness is beginning to impact\r\nupon its legitimacy. The Security Council is the linchpin of\r\nthe whole United Nations peace and security system, and it\r\nis in no one’s interest that its credibility should be allowed\r\nto gradually erode. The outstanding questions about the size\r\nand shape of the Council should certainly be resolved by the\r\ntime of the United Nations fiftieth anniversary in 1995.\r\nThis, indeed, remains an ideal target date for the\r\nachievement of a whole range of necessary organizational\r\nreforms.\r\nRunning right through the study - and underlying all the\r\nsuggestions we have been making about structure and\r\nprocess - is a single sustaining idea, that of cooperative\r\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsecurity. This embraces two perhaps rather more familiar\r\nideas, common security and collective security. But the\r\noverall flavour of cooperative security can perhaps best be\r\ncaptured by describing it, in a little more detail, as an\r\napproach that emphasizes reassurance rather than deterrence;\r\nthat is inclusive rather than exclusive; that favours\r\nmultilateralism over unilateralism or bilateralism; that does\r\nnot rank military solutions over non-military ones; that\r\nassumes that States are the principal actors in the security\r\nsystem, but also accepts that non-State actors have an\r\nimportant role to play; that does not particularly emphasize\r\nthe creation of formal security institutions but does not reject\r\nthem either; and that above all stresses the value of creating\r\nhabits of dialogue.\r\nA good deal of the spirit of cooperative security is in\r\nfact to be found in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nParagraph 4 of Article 1, a provision much neglected in the\r\npast, designates the United Nations as a \"centre for\r\nharmonizing the actions of nations\" - not the sentiments of\r\nnations, but the actions of nations. In Articles 55 and 56\r\nMember States pledge themselves to create the\r\n\"conditions of stability and well-being which are\r\nnecessary for peaceful and friendly relations among\r\nnations\".\r\nUnderscored in that context are the promotion of higher\r\nstandards of living, the solution of economic and social\r\nproblems and respect for human rights.\r\nToo often during the cold war we looked past these\r\nobligations and concerns, because we were preoccupied with\r\nmilitary means of survival. But the threats that concerned us\r\nthen no longer exist; and what was written in San Francisco,\r\nbefore the cold war froze our capacity to deal with many\r\nother kinds of threats to security, should now be seen as a\r\ncompelling guide.\r\nOur survival in the 1990s and beyond will depend on\r\nour developing a new understanding of what constitutes\r\nsecurity and what contributes to it. It will depend on our\r\ncapacity to think clearly about how to react to new security\r\nproblems as they arise. It will depend on our willingness to\r\nrethink and to reshape our institutions, including the United\r\nNations, so that they can cope with new realities. But,\r\nabove all, it will depend on our all developing and sustaining\r\na real commitment to cooperating for peace.\r\nMr. ESSY (Côte d’Ivoire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I should like to pay tribute to the wisdom of the\r\nAssembly in electing Ambassador Insanally to preside over\r\nthis session, thus highlighting the outstanding role of his\r\ncountry, the Republic of Guyana, and beyond it that of Latin\r\nAmerica in international relations.\r\nI also wish to congratulate the members of the Bureau\r\nand to extend to the outgoing President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev,\r\nour warm congratulations on the excellent work done during\r\nhis mandate.\r\nI should also like to reaffirm the full confidence of\r\nC ô t e d ’ I v o i r e i n t h e S e c r e t a r y - G e n e r a l ,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. President Houphouët-Boigny,\r\nwho has met him several times this year, greatly appreciates\r\nhis impartiality and ability and his great devotion to his\r\nduties to the international community.\r\nFinally, my delegation congratulates and welcomes the\r\nStates admitted since the last session to our Organization,\r\nwhich is thus moving ever closer to its objective of\r\nuniversality.\r\nMr. Musuka (Zambia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe substantial transformations that have taken place in\r\nthe world since 1989 have given rise to profound changes in\r\ninternational relations. All the points of reference that\r\nallowed us to analyse these relations with certitude have\r\ndisappeared. The new atmosphere of confidence and the\r\nspirit of understanding, and at times of solidarity, that\r\nprevail in relations between States and peoples give grounds\r\nfor hope and the rapid advent of a new international order\r\nthat will be more stable, more just and more able to meet the\r\naspirations of peoples for shared happiness in a world that\r\nhungers for bread and thirsts for truth. Today’s world is\r\nmoving towards a convergence around certain values,\r\nincluding the primacy of respect for human rights, the\r\nimperative need for democracy, development and\r\ndisarmament and the leading role of law in international\r\nrelations. Such development can only give rise to great\r\nhopes by opening up the possibility of correcting past\r\nmistakes, sharing the benefits of progress with all and\r\nensuring the fullness of peace.\r\nWith the beginning of real disarmament and the recent\r\nsigning of the Convention banning chemical weapons, the\r\nrelationship between war and peace is today undergoing a\r\nclear qualitative change. Unfortunately, however, we must\r\nrecognize that the international situation is far from\r\nsatisfying our hopes for justice and lasting peace.\r\nIndeed, the collapse of the bipolar world seems,\r\nparadoxically, to have opened the door for new threats to\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 29\r\ninternational peace and security. The accumulation of poorly\r\nbandaged wounds, blind ambitions and feelings of rivalry\r\nand hatred built up over decades has re-emerged in various\r\nregions of the world in the form of extremely devastating\r\nand brutal fratricidal conflicts. Thus, Europe, whose level of\r\nsocio-economic development did not prevent it from\r\ndestroying itself twice in less than thirty years, is today still\r\nin the grip of a terrible conflict in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThat anachronistic and indescribably barbarous war has\r\njustified the creation, for the first time within the United\r\nNations system, of an international penal tribunal, under\r\nSecurity Council resolution 827 (1993). So too, Africa,\r\npushed aside by the disappearance of the bipolar world, has\r\nbeen torn by numerous internal conflicts with unfortunate\r\nconsequences for the entire continent, which needs, rather,\r\nstability and peace within African States, between African\r\nStates and between Africa and the rest of the world in order\r\nto deal with the imperative needs of its development and\r\neconomic integration.\r\nThe situation in Somalia continues to be of great\r\nconcern, despite the presence of the United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping forces, for the spectre of anarchy, intolerance in all\r\nits forms and violence continues to hover over that country.\r\nWe hope that the tireless and commendable efforts of the\r\ninternational community to re-establish peace in that country\r\nwill, within the allotted time, lead to a positive conclusion\r\nand the reconciliation of all its sons and daughters.\r\nWe also hope to see very soon a resolution of the\r\nconflict in Liberia. Recent developments in that brotherly\r\nand neighbourly country, which led to the conclusion of the\r\nCotonou Agreement on 25 July 1993, tend to make us more\r\noptimistic about the rapid restoration of peace.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire has always wished fervently to see the\r\nre-establishment of peace in Liberia and has, in addition,\r\nacted along these lines, as the Yamassoukro Accords attest.\r\nWe are gratified by the formation in that country of a\r\ntransitional government in the form of a State council\r\nentrusted with the organization of general elections. We\r\nwelcome the firm determination of the political elements in\r\nLiberia to work for the ultimate collapse of the wall of\r\nhatred and enmity between Liberian brothers and thus to lay\r\nthe foundation for a future of peace and prosperity for all.\r\nIn this context it is urgent that the international community\r\ncommit itself further to finding the necessary means for the\r\nrapid deployment of new contingents to reinforce the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nMilitary Observer Group (ECOMOG) in Liberia to promote\r\nthe effective implementation of the provisions of the\r\nCotonou Agreement, particularly with regard to the entry\r\ninto force of the Council of State, disarmament and the\r\ncantonment of factions. It is equally urgent that the\r\ninternational community come to the assistance, within the\r\nframework of Chapter VIII of the Charter, of States or\r\nregional organizations, participating in peace-keeping efforts\r\nin Liberia. It is also necessary that the question of the\r\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance be rapidly resolved to\r\nallow for the regular supply of those regions of Liberia\r\nwhere famine is raging in order to prevent the incursions of\r\narmed bands in search of food that attack border villages and\r\nhamlets. Here we should like to congratulate all the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations that are making every effort,\r\nwith courage, tenacity and dedication, to save human lives\r\nin that strife-torn country.\r\nIt is also fitting to welcome the conclusion of the\r\nInternational Conference for the Protection of War Victims\r\nheld at Geneva from 3 August to 2 September this year,\r\norganized by the Swiss Government and the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross. That Conference allowed for\r\na reaffirmation of the provisions of the major treaties of\r\ninternational humanitarian law aimed at the protection of\r\npopulations during armed conflicts and for sensitizing public\r\nopinion concerning the valid bases of those provisions and\r\nthe plight of civilian victims.\r\nConcerning Angola, progress made at the outset in the\r\napplication of the Bicesse peace agreements in May 1991\r\nnow needs to be maintained, and efforts must be made and\r\nencouraged, both in the Security Council and in African\r\nforums, for the achievement of a just and lasting peace.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire knows only two paths for the settlement\r\nof conflicts: resort to force or resort to negotiation, that is\r\nto say, dialogue. Recent events in the international arena\r\nhave consecrated the value of dialogue, which has always\r\nbeen advocated by President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, for\r\nthe peaceful settlement of all conflicts. They clearly indicate\r\nhow dialogue, conducted by responsible individuals, can,\r\nregardless of the nature of the conflict, serve as an extremely\r\nuseful instrument for peace.\r\nIn South Africa, the recent developments in the political\r\nsituation are most encouraging, despite the uncertainties of\r\nthe moment resulting from the escalation of violence. For\r\nthis reason we welcome with satisfaction the joint statement\r\nof the political parties of South Africa concerning their\r\nintention to organize free and democratic elections in April\r\n1994. We also welcome the establishment of an executive\r\ntransition council that, for the first time in three centuries of\r\nwhite domination, after the first multiracial elections will\r\ninvolve the black majority in political matters.\r\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nWe send out an urgent appeal to those elements\r\nopposed to democratic changes in South Africa to refrain\r\nfrom acts likely to jeopardize the sensitive negotiation\r\nprocess, which would delay South Africa’s return to the\r\nfamily of nations. We welcome the new spirit inspiring the\r\nSouth African leaders, particularly Mr. De Klerk and Mr.\r\nMandela, a spirit that led to the historic request made by the\r\nAfrican National Congress (ANC) to the international\r\ncommunity to lift the economic and diplomatic sanctions\r\nslapped on South Africa. We also welcome the agreement\r\nreached between the South African and Namibian\r\nGovernments concerning the transfer of the port of Walvis\r\nBay and the surrounding islands to the jurisdiction of the\r\nNamibian Government.\r\nIn the Middle East we can finally discern, after so\r\nmany years of war and built-up hatred, the prospect of a\r\nsettlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The mutual\r\nrecognition of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO) and the signing in Washington on 13\r\nSeptember of the historic agreement on Gaza and Jericho\r\nconvince us that the process begun in the Middle East is\r\nnow irreversible, despite the obstacles that might arise on the\r\nroad to peace.\r\nThis is the moment to hail the courage, lucidity and\r\nself-abnegation of the high Israeli and Palestinian officials\r\nwho have risen above circumstances and resolutely chosen\r\npeace. Their ardour in working for peace after such a\r\nlengthy period of war has been recognized and saluted by\r\nthe international community. It is quite fitting that the\r\nmembers of the jury for the Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize,\r\nestablished by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization, unanimously awarded the Prize for\r\n1993 to those illustrious leaders of Israel and Palestine.\r\nAs for the situation in the Gulf, where peace is still\r\nprecarious, we reiterate our unswerving support for the full\r\nimplementation of all resolutions on this conflict, particularly\r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991, as\r\nwell as resolution 833 (1993). We call on the parties\r\nconcerned to respect these provisions. We believe that this\r\nresolution is a major asset in assuring security and stability\r\nin the region.\r\nIn Asia, we welcome the outcome of the conflict in\r\nCambodia, where the United Nations undertook one of the\r\nmost ambitious and complex peace-keeping operations it had\r\never conducted. We congratulate the members of the United\r\nNations Secretariat and the States that supplied various\r\ncontingents for the success of this operation, which allows\r\nworld public opinion fully to appreciate this other activity of\r\nthe United Nations which is too often ignored.\r\nIf the conflicts born of the cold war are now beginning\r\nto find solutions, it is none the less clear that we have\r\nentered upon a period of uncertainty, questioning and\r\ninstability, with the re-emergence of a number of secondary\r\nconflicts that had been effectively frozen or repressed during\r\nthe cold war and that are essentially of ethnic, tribal or\r\nreligious origin, as illustrated by the wrenching events in\r\nNagorny-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and the former Yugoslavia.\r\nIt is becoming clear as well that in today’s world there are\r\nfewer and fewer identifiable enemies and more and more\r\nproblems that are very difficult to identify.\r\nThe United Nations remains the indispensable recourse\r\nfor confronting these conflicts. Here, we solemnly wish to\r\nstate our full support for the proposals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral contained in \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nThe strengthening of preventive action by the United\r\nNations must prompt us to pursue the process of\r\nrestructuring and revitalization of its bodies to allow it to\r\ncope with these new challenges. Given the dominant role of\r\nthe Security Council in peace-keeping and international\r\nsecurity, the question of equitable representation in that body\r\nshould allow for a lengthy reflection so as to find a solution\r\nacceptable to all - in this case, the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil to accord with the growth in the number of our\r\nOrganization’s Members and in the complexity of the\r\nproblems submitted to it.\r\nSuch an expansion should be based on rigorous and\r\nobjective criteria which we need to define together, bearing\r\nin mind the imperative need for effectiveness in the taking\r\nand implementation of Security Council decisions. The\r\nUnited Nations, as a reflection of universal values, cannot\r\nstand outside the trend towards democratization which is\r\nsweeping across the world.\r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, held in\r\nVienna last June, was of pivotal importance, allowing for a\r\nreaffirmation of human rights. If we can rightly be gratified\r\nby the fact that this Conference recognized the right to\r\ndevelopment as a fundamental human right to the disastrous\r\neconomic situation in numerous regions of the world, and\r\nparticularly in Africa, should remind us here of the need for\r\na general awareness of the fact that human rights cannot\r\nflourish in a context of poverty and misery.\r\nIn looking back over the economic situation, we note\r\nthat global economic activity in 1992 was characterized by\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 31\r\na slow recovery, growing by only 1.1 per cent. This weak\r\nrecovery is primarily the result of a moderate growth in the\r\nglobal production of the industrialized countries, as well as\r\na noticeable drop in the total production of those countries\r\nwhich formerly had planned economies. Unfortunately,\r\nthese trends continued in 1993, and thus we are seeing a rise\r\nin unemployment and the emergence of serious social\r\ntensions throughout the world.\r\nThese not very optimistic elements observed in the\r\nindustrialized countries can only have negative consequences\r\nfor other countries, particularly those of the developing\r\nworld, among which the African countries remain the most\r\nvulnerable.\r\nWe can therefore hardly be surprised that in the last\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme report on human\r\ndevelopment in 173 countries, 41 of the 53 African countries\r\nare among the 50 last countries in the classification. These\r\npessimistic conclusions were reaffirmed in the reports of the\r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\r\nWe are aware of the causes of this serious recession.\r\nAside from the drop in economic activities in numerous\r\nindustrialized countries, those causes are the collapse of\r\ncommodity prices - for minerals, mining and agriculture -\r\nand the subsequent exacerbation of the foreign-debt burden\r\non our economies, which in turn limits our investment\r\ncapability. Additional causes that should be noted are the\r\ngeneral inadequacies in economic management as described\r\nin the World Bank study entitled \"The African Capacity-\r\nBuilding Initiative\". All these factors taken together have\r\nled to the present crisis in our countries, manifested above\r\nall by a drastic drop in economic growth and an intolerable\r\nrise in unemployment, particularly among our young people\r\n- the driving force of our countries.\r\nThe image this brief sketch of the African economic\r\nand social climate projects is hardly encouraging. In the\r\nface of such a situation, we believe that prospects for seeing\r\nthe advocated solutions succeed lie primarily in a consistent\r\napproach to them.\r\nOur States have had the political courage to embark\r\nupon deep-rooted economic reforms and our peoples have\r\nprogressively become aware of the need for the adjustment\r\neffort. Thus in Côte d’Ivoire, for several years now, we\r\nhave been implementing a set of measures of economic\r\npolicy aimed at creating the conditions for economic\r\nrecovery. The stabilization phase of this process has\r\nprimarily tended towards putting our public finances on a\r\nsounder footing, which is basic to the revival of our\r\neconomy and its integration into a larger collective within\r\nthe region and throughout the continent.\r\nThe extension of the democratic process in Africa is\r\nevident. But it is also clear that there can be no democracy\r\nwithout economic development, nor genuine sustainable\r\ndevelopment without democracy. One of the primary\r\nconditions of this development for our countries is just\r\nremuneration in primary commodities - mineral, mining and\r\nagricultural.\r\nStatistics show that Africa represents only 2 per cent of\r\nthe value of world trade, and that inter-African trade\r\nrepresents only 5 per cent of the value of the region’s total\r\nexternal trade. These data remind us once again of the\r\neconomic urgency for Africa to achieve genuine economic\r\nintegration within the continent.\r\nIn West Africa, this exercise has already begun, in\r\nparticular within the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS), whose treaty has just been revised, and\r\nabove all within the West African Monetary Union\r\n(WAMU), with the upcoming establishment of the West\r\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).\r\nFrom our point of view, such an exercise in structuring\r\nand harmonizing the institutional and legal framework of\r\neconomic integration should be carried out and should\r\nrapidly be extended to all regions of Africa in order to pave\r\nthe way for the building of the African Common Market,\r\nwhich we all so wish to see.\r\nIt is also appropriate to note the great hopes we place\r\non the establishment of the African Import-Export Bank,\r\nwhose primary objectives will be to increase the level of\r\nAfrican exports and of inter-African trade. We should also\r\nnote the significant progress made in laying the groundwork\r\nfor an expanded cooperation between our States in several\r\nareas, such as those of business law, the insurance industry,\r\nand the establishment of a body for regional statistics.\r\nWe wish here particularly to emphasize the extremely\r\nimportant role played in the area of financing by the African\r\nDevelopment Bank in implementing the objectives of\r\nintegration in Africa. We must hail the will this institution\r\ndemonstrates in its efforts to establish positive correlations\r\nbetween actions implemented within the framework of\r\nstructural adjustment programmes and the objectives of\r\nregional economic integration. This step by the African\r\nDevelopment Bank affects the central elements of the\r\ndevelopment strategies of African countries.\r\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIt goes without saying that such integration can be\r\nimplemented only in an environment which is one of peace,\r\nstability and security. We therefore welcomed the creation,\r\nwithin the OAU and ECOWAS, of machinery for the\r\nprevention, management and settlement of conflicts.\r\nWe must recognize that our efforts at regional\r\nintegration will remain futile as long as the global economic\r\nenvironment remains unfavourable and as long as our\r\npartners in the developed countries lack the necessary\r\npolitical will resolutely to tackle our countries’ problems in\r\nthis interdependent world of solidarity.\r\nAt a time when the marginalization of Africa is\r\nincreasing, we welcome the positive initiative of the\r\nGovernment of Japan to hold, several days from now in\r\nTokyo, the International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment, which will allow the developed countries to\r\nbetter grasp the specific problems of Africa.\r\nWe must acknowledge, however, that any assistance\r\noffered by the international community will be only a small\r\ncontribution, given the magnitude of the development needs\r\nof the African continent. This assistance will be effective\r\nonly if consistent and lasting solutions are found to our\r\nproblems within the framework of an international\r\ncooperation even further based on interdependence and\r\nsolidarity, in particular in the areas of international trade,\r\nforeign debt, the environment, the war on drugs, and the\r\nimportant question of raw materials, to avoid confining our\r\ncountries to the exclusive role of purveyors of raw materials\r\nand allow them also, through the transformation of these\r\nproducts, to become consumers in trade relations.\r\nMore specifically, the Rio Conference, by adopting\r\nAgenda 21, reached a consensus on the planetary level\r\nconcerning the need for immediate and bold international\r\ncooperation in the area of sustainable development and the\r\nenvironment. In applying Agenda 21, Côte d’Ivoire, for its\r\npart, has established regional environmental committees to\r\ndraw up its white book on the environment, which will help\r\nit zero in on the objectives laid down in the Agenda.\r\nIn this context, the elaboration of an international\r\nconvention on the struggle against desertification is of\r\ncritical importance for Africa, and we continue to place our\r\nhopes in the work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee on that convention.\r\nUltimately, given the importance and complexity of the\r\nareas affecting the question of the environment, it is\r\nindispensable for the international community to openly\r\nsupport the development efforts of the African countries by\r\ngranting them adequate financial resources and by helping\r\nthem strengthen their scientific and technical capacities.\r\nConcerning the question of drugs and its financial\r\nramifications, the gravity of these issues requires that the\r\ninternational community give them serious thought. The\r\nmost recent studies of this phenomenon indicate that Africa\r\nhas become one of the major centres for this illegal traffic.\r\nAt the same time, we note that local consumption of hard\r\ndrugs, in particular heroin and cocaine, are notably\r\nincreasing in numerous African countries.\r\nThis represents, therefore, a global scourge against\r\nwhich individual States are doomed from the outset, for the\r\nravages of drugs spare no continent and no country,\r\nregardless of how powerful they may be.\r\nAfrica is the weak link from which the international\r\ndrug trade profits. Thus, given the extreme vulnerability and\r\nthe precarious nature of the means available to the African\r\ncontinent to combat this danger, the international community\r\nshould supply - specifically through the United Nations Drug\r\nControl Programme, with which my country is fruitfully\r\ncooperating - the needed financial resources.\r\nSince the end of the bipolar war, history has speeded\r\nup. We are the privileged witnesses of political events of\r\nthe highest importance, events that will shape international\r\nrelations along the lines of a rapprochement among nations\r\nand will therefore contribute to the strengthening of peace\r\nand global security, essential foundations for the building of\r\na more just world order and one of greater solidarity.\r\nHowever, despite the dynamics of peace, which promise\r\nbetter tomorrows, we must admit that the ideas of peace and\r\nsecurity can no longer be limited solely to the political field,\r\nfor the truth is that peace and security can be genuine only\r\nif economic development and social progress are ensured for\r\nall.\r\nThe effective globalization of the economy as well as\r\nthe ever-increasing interdependence of nations today requires\r\nalso an acceleration of history on the level of international\r\neconomic relations, for the world must become aware of the\r\nfact that there can be no lasting peace, no universal\r\nprosperity, if the greatest part of humankind is on the\r\nsidelines of economic development and social well-being.\r\nIn such a context, therefore, the North-South dialogue\r\nmust be reactivated with the goal of seeing that further\r\nmeans are established to eradicate underdevelopment and\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 33\r\npoverty, which today represent the greatest threat of our era.\r\nFor peace does not coexist well with poverty, as President\r\nFelix Houphouët-Boigny often says.\r\nThe capability of the international community to grasp\r\nthis danger and to find rapid and lasting solutions will\r\ndetermine our joint survival.\r\nMr. HANNIBALSSON (Iceland): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating the President, on his election to his high\r\noffice. I wish him every success and pledge to him the full\r\nsupport of my delegation.\r\nIt gives me pleasure to welcome the new Member\r\nStates which have joined the Organization since the\r\nbeginning of the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly - the new Member States of Andorra, Eritrea, the\r\nCzech Republic, Monaco, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, and Slovakia. With 184 Member States - and\r\neven more prospective Members - our Organization is able\r\nto claim for itself a higher degree of universality than ever.\r\nIn extending the reach of the United Nations, we serve\r\nthe basic goals for which our Organization was brought into\r\nbeing; for the rule of law, freedom and the dignity and worth\r\nof the human person are ideals common to all men,\r\nirrespective of their cultural or geographical surroundings.\r\nBut the simple reach of the United Nations must not be\r\nconfused with its comprehensiveness as an institution.\r\nTherefore, as we recommit ourselves to the basic objectives\r\ninscribed in the United Nations Charter almost 50 years ago,\r\nwe must also maintain the flexibility necessary to readjust\r\nour structures and working habits accordingly.\r\nThe question how to maintain the cohesiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations amidst the myriad - and at times conflicting -\r\ndemands being made of it presents itself nowadays with\r\nparticular force. Changes on the world stage have taken\r\nplace with almost dizzying speed in the last four years. The\r\nmost important of those changes, the passing of the cold\r\nwar, has created new opportunities for the United Nations\r\nand has raised expectations among the peoples of the world\r\nat large. At the same time, the world itself has in many\r\nways become more unpredictable, placing serious obstacles\r\non the path of long-term planning.\r\nTo escape this quandary, there is a need to take a\r\nbalanced view of what the United Nations can and cannot be\r\nexpected to do. We must moderate ambition with reality.\r\nWe must not divorce the words we use from the actions we\r\nare willing to take. If we do, we may indeed succeed in\r\nbuilding a Platonic city in speech, a United Nations which\r\nwould stand only a limited chance of ever being actualized,\r\nbut the down side would be to risk undermining the trust\r\ninvested by the public in our Organization.\r\nOn the bright side, a number of recent developments\r\nhave helped the United Nations in translating its basic vision\r\ninto reality. Breakthroughs have taken place in regional\r\nconflicts which have been a thorn in the side of the\r\ninternational community for several decades. Governments\r\nhave increasingly come to recognize the growing threat to\r\nthe ecosystem of our planet. The protection of human rights\r\nis no longer seen as the exclusive domain of the nation\r\nState. Last but not least, mankind has moved further away\r\nfrom the brink of nuclear Armageddon.\r\nThose are considerable accomplishments. But this is\r\nnone the less hardly the time for members of the community\r\nof nations to congratulate each other. There are regions of\r\nthe world where terrifying carnage is still taking place before\r\nour very eyes. Deterioration of the environment, while\r\nhighly uneven in gravity and scope, is a long way from\r\nbeing reversed. Human-rights abuses continue in many\r\nplaces on an appalling scale. And while the threat of a\r\nworldwide nuclear catastrophe may have passed, there is a\r\ndangerous proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nbringing uncertainty and new instabilities in its wake. Now\r\nis clearly the time to rise above these issues that divide our\r\nAssembly and to concentrate our efforts on dealing with\r\nsuch challenges effectively.\r\nThe landmark peace agreement recently signed between\r\nformer adversaries in the Middle East should be a source of\r\nencouragement to all nations. We are being reminded of the\r\nancient truth that where there is sufficient devotion and will\r\namong the parties concerned, there is also a way to solve\r\neven the most intractable issues. My Government welcomes\r\nthe historic accord between the State of Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization. We hope that the mutual\r\nrecognition of the two parties will yield further agreements\r\nin the region, paving the way for a comprehensive peace\r\nsettlement.\r\nWhile paying tribute to the vision and bravery of Israeli\r\nand Palestinian leaders, I take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the Government of Norway on its initiative in\r\nbringing the ancient adversaries together at the same table,\r\nand I also commend the Governments of the United States\r\nand Russia for their valuable mediation. It is now up to the\r\nworld community to provide the political support and the\r\neconomic aid for reconstruction so vitally needed to keep the\r\nprocess alive. The Nordic Governments, for their part, have\r\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nalready decided to participate fully in that endeavour. This\r\nis a process which cannot be permitted to fail.\r\nThe world community has recently witnessed another\r\nbold step forward, which, hopefully, also marks an important\r\ncontribution to international peace and stability. I am\r\nreferring to the courageous statesmanship of the President of\r\nthe Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, in moving decisively\r\ntowards democratic elections to Parliament. As the only\r\ndemocratically elected representative of the Russian people,\r\nPresident Yeltsin deserves the vigorous support of the\r\noutside world in carrying out his far-reaching programme of\r\nreform.\r\nA different area offering a glimmer of hope is South\r\nAfrica. My Government welcomes recent progress towards\r\ngenuine democracy in South Africa, including the decision\r\nto hold free and fair elections next year. The international\r\ncommunity should now speedily heed the call of Mr. Nelson\r\nMandela, made from this podium last week, for the removal\r\nof all economic sanctions, an action Iceland hopes will serve\r\nfully to normalize the status of South Africa in the\r\ncommunity of nations. Iceland, for its part, has already\r\nabolished the embargo on trade with South Africa.\r\nSadly, we face continuation of the conflicts in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, not least the tragic situation prevailing in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. It serves to remind us that ethnic\r\nconflicts can no longer be regarded as the sole responsibility\r\nof individual States. The inhumanity perpetrated on innocent\r\ncivilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other former\r\nYugoslav Republics has reached a point where the\r\ninternational community must act, and decisively, with all\r\nthe resources provided for in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. My Government fully supports the negotiations\r\nsponsored by the United Nations and the European\r\nCommunity, and looks forward to an early agreement and\r\nimplementation of the Geneva peace plan. The parties to the\r\nconflict must be brought to realize that a solution can be\r\nfound only through peaceful means. Iceland also attaches\r\nimportance to the effective functioning of the war crimes\r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Those responsible for\r\natrocities must be brought to justice.\r\nAs the conflict in the former Yugoslavia has exposed\r\nthe present limitations of regional structures, the United\r\nNations has assumed responsibility for reintroducing peace\r\nand stability in the area. Meanwhile, there are outstanding\r\nexamples of cooperation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations and other organizations, including the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Western European\r\nUnion (WEU) and the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions with regard to the former\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nIn Iceland’s view there is a need to develop these\r\nrelationships further. Suffice it to say that NATO’s\r\nreadiness to employ military force for the relief of Sarajevo\r\nand for the long-term implementation of the Geneva peace\r\nplan would serve the interests of the international community\r\nand should therefore be welcomed and encouraged.\r\nTwo years ago we welcomed the three Baltic States,\r\nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as sovereign Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. Since then the world community, and their\r\nEuropean neighbours in particular, have reached out and\r\noffered cooperation and help in the ongoing reconstruction\r\nof those Republics. The Baltic States have, for their part,\r\ndemonstrated their willingness to live up to the highest\r\nstandards of democratic societies. They adhere to\r\ninternational instruments and are members of organizations\r\nthat are fully capable of monitoring their respect for\r\ninternational obligations in the field of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. I should like to express my\r\nGovernment’s hope that negotiations on the departure of all\r\nforeign military forces from Estonia and Latvia will soon be\r\nsuccessfully concluded and a clear timetable established.\r\nThe recent departure of foreign forces from Lithuania should\r\nset an example.\r\nRestoring the environment and attaining sustainable\r\nglobal development are among the most challenging tasks\r\nfacing the world community today. The outcome of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, held in Rio de Janeiro last year, has brought\r\nthose tasks into sharper focus. The subsequent establishment\r\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development was an\r\nimportant step in facilitating international cooperation for the\r\neffective follow-up and implementation of the outcome of\r\nthe Conference. However, declarations, strategies and action\r\nplans are only as good as their implementation. If the\r\ncredibility of the United Nations in this area is to be\r\nmaintained in the wake of the Rio Conference, we must\r\nmake sure to obtain real action and results.\r\nThe action programme contained in Agenda 21 of the\r\nRio Conference provides a sound basis for our individual or\r\njoint activities aimed at sustainable development. It does\r\nnot, however, cover all activities harmful to the environment,\r\nincluding pollution of the marine environment from\r\nland-based activities and the depletion of marine living\r\nresources in many parts of the world. While the programme\r\ncontains important recommendations pertinent to these\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 35\r\nissues, the main responsibility for developing global action\r\nto protect the marine environment and to conserve its living\r\nresources has been delegated to other forums, including the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and\r\nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks.\r\nIceland has participated actively in that Conference.\r\nTogether with Argentina, Canada, Chile and New Zealand,\r\nIceland has submitted a draft convention that seeks to deal\r\non a global level with the conservation and rational\r\nmanagement of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory\r\nfish stocks. Consistent with the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea, the draft convention calls for\r\nincreased regional cooperation in the establishment of\r\nconservation and management measures and elaborates\r\nmechanisms for the enforcement of agreed measures. My\r\nGovernment will continue to work with all other interested\r\nGovernments to achieve results at the next session of the\r\nConference, results acceptable to all fishing nations, both\r\ndistant-water States and coastal States.\r\nAs a nation overwhelmingly dependent on marine living\r\nresources, Iceland has supported efforts to establish an\r\ninternational regime to govern all aspects of the uses of the\r\noceans. Iceland participated actively in the Third United\r\nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea and ratified the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1985.\r\nIceland believes that the Convention provides for a widely\r\nacceptable regime for the rational exploitation of the world’s\r\nmarine resources and establishes rules for a wide range of\r\nuses for the seas, thereby reducing the potential for conflict\r\namong States in this field.\r\nThe Government of Iceland is greatly encouraged by\r\nthe results of the most recent round of consultations, under\r\nthe auspices of the Secretary-General, directed at addressing\r\nproblems which have prevented certain industrialized\r\ncountries from becoming parties to the Convention. We are\r\nhopeful that at the next round agreement will be reached on\r\nthe framework of negotiations which will enable the early\r\nentry into force of the Convention with universal\r\nparticipation.\r\nAs early as 1989 Iceland emphasized in this forum the\r\nneed for a new international instrument, an \"Earth Charter\",\r\nwhich would define the responsibilities and rights of nations\r\nwith respect to the environment. My Government regrets\r\nthat an agreement on such a charter was not reached before\r\nthe Rio Conference. We would therefore strongly support\r\ntransforming the Rio Declaration into an \"Earth Charter\"\r\nbefore the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations two\r\nyears hence.\r\nAll nations have an obligation not only to protect and\r\npreserve the environment, but also to promote human rights\r\nand foster social and economic progress. The United\r\nNations Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna last\r\nJune was a world event of major significance. The results\r\nof the Conference, especially when seen in the context of\r\nimprovements in the international political climate in the\r\nrecent past, give us reason to hope for a more effective\r\nimplementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\neverywhere.\r\nFor the first time ever it appears that the majority of\r\ncountries in the world now pledge allegiance to the\r\nprinciples of democratic rule of law. Still, we are\r\nconfronted with breaches of human rights all around the\r\nworld. In the follow-up to the Conference on Human\r\nRights, we must address such breaches squarely and focus\r\nattention on ensuring greater respect and accountability by\r\nGovernments for the protection of human rights. This\r\nmeans, among other things, devoting more resources to this\r\nfield as a reflection of the political commitment of Member\r\nStates. Increased resources are required if the Centre for\r\nHuman Rights is to be able to provide effective advisory\r\nservices and human-rights monitoring. At the same time,\r\nIceland would like to support the establishment of the post\r\nof high commissioner for human rights.\r\nThe determination of our countries to promote social\r\nprogress and better standards of life is an important\r\ncommitment embedded in the United Nations Charter.\r\nIceland hopes that the world summit in 1995 will serve to\r\nbring issues of social development into sharper focus and\r\nhighlight, in particular, the plight of the more than one\r\nbillion people living below the absolute poverty line.\r\nIn this connection, I would like to draw special\r\nattention to the growing problem of world population\r\ncontrol, which could have serious social, economic and\r\nenvironmental repercussions if not properly managed in the\r\ndecades ahead. Around 90 per cent of the predicted world\r\npopulation growth between now and the end of the first\r\nquarter of the twenty-first century is expected to occur in the\r\ndeveloping countries, placing enormous new strains on their\r\nresources. Against this background, the decision to convene\r\nan international conference on population and development\r\nin Cairo next year is to be welcomed.\r\nTo stimulate social development, we need, among other\r\nthings, economic growth. The liberalization of world trade\r\nis the single most important vehicle for world economic\r\ngrowth. The growing importance of the General Agreement\r\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is clearly manifested in the\r\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nflood of new accessions and the overriding importance\r\nattached to the Uruguay Round by the Governments of the\r\nworld. Since the end of the cold war, GATT has achieved\r\nan even greater role in international relations; countries in\r\ntransition see it as a vital venue for their relations with each\r\nother and for their integration into the world economy. In\r\nthe last few years political walls between cultures and\r\nnations have been demolished. Trade barriers must not,\r\nhowever, be allowed to replace iron curtains.\r\nEconomic reform, the environment, job-creation and\r\ninvestment, to name but a few, are issues that affect and are\r\naffected by international trade. A successful conclusion of\r\nthe Uruguay Round, which now seems to be within reach,\r\nwould dramatically improve our ability to deal with those\r\nproblems through international cooperation and trade. A\r\nfailure, on the other hand, would be a fatal blow to the\r\nmultinational trading system and to GATT. Protectionism\r\nwould again raise its ugly head and conflicts would erupt,\r\nwith disastrous consequences for the world economy.\r\nGATT’s business is therefore the world’s business.\r\nThe Uruguay Round represents a tremendous opportunity to\r\nrevitalize world trade. All countries stand to gain from this.\r\nThe biggest gain will accrue to the developing countries and\r\nto economies in transition. We who are gathered here at the\r\nGeneral Assembly representing the citizens, our countries’\r\nconsumers, cannot and must not allow special-interest groups\r\nto block the negotiations in the few strenuous final steps\r\nneeded to reach the goal before the end of this year.\r\nIssues of social and economic development, of human\r\nrights and of environmental protection are part and parcel of\r\nthe notion of extended security, which we are all getting\r\naccustomed to in the aftermath of the cold war. Arms\r\ncontrol remains, however, a very important element of\r\npost-cold-war security. The success achieved in nuclear- and\r\nconventional-arms control in recent years represents a\r\nhistorical turning-point which must be exploited for the\r\nlong-term advancement of global peace and stability. Here,\r\nthe United Nations is singularly well placed to assume a\r\nmore active role. This applies to both global perspectives\r\nand support for regional initiatives.\r\nThe systematic acquisition of nuclear warheads, ballistic\r\nmissiles, and chemical and biological weapons by a number\r\nof States is a matter of serious concern to the international\r\ncommunity. Non-proliferation should be given priority and\r\nefforts made to ensure that the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is both universally\r\nadhered to and indefinitely extended. It is also to be hoped\r\nthat the present moratorium on nuclear testing will\r\neventually be succeeded by a comprehensive and verifiable\r\ntest ban.\r\nPeace-keeping operations are among the areas where\r\nthe Organization has enjoyed considerable success. The\r\nresult is that Member States have placed increasing demands\r\non the Organization. However, the time has now come to\r\nreview the activities of the United Nations in this field. The\r\ngoal must be to ensure that peace-keeping operations serve\r\nthe purpose for which they were intended and that their\r\nmandates are specific and more limited in time. In this\r\nconnection, the idea of a United Nations stand-by force that\r\nwould enable the United Nations to act swiftly when crises\r\narise should be carefully considered. The existence of such\r\na force would enhance the credibility of and respect for the\r\nOrganization. Meanwhile, Member States must live up to\r\ntheir current obligations and pay their assessed contributions\r\nto peace-keeping operations in full and on time.\r\nAt the outset of my speech I referred to the need for\r\nthe United Nations to be responsive to change. Since the\r\nlast review of the membership of the Security Council took\r\nplace, there has been a substantial increase in the number of\r\nStates Members of the United Nations. At the same time the\r\nCouncil has, especially in recent years, increasingly assumed\r\nthe role envisaged for it in the relevant provisions of the\r\nCharter. The time is therefore ripe to review the Council’s\r\nmembership. The goal of such a review must be to make\r\nthe Council more representative and thus, indeed, more\r\neffective.\r\nI would like to welcome initiatives taken recently to\r\nstreamline the structure of the United Nations and to make\r\nits daily operations and management more effective. This is\r\nnecessary in particular in order for the Organization to\r\nregain the trust of its Member States. In this connection,\r\nIceland favours the establishment of a permanent office of\r\ninspections and investigations and hopes that such an office\r\nwill help to ensure that allegations of fraud, waste and\r\ncorruption are investigated expeditiously.\r\nNow, more than ever, there is an opportunity for the\r\nUnited Nations to adapt to the positive political\r\ndevelopments of the recent past and to revamp its structures\r\nfrom within. Let us join forces in building a stronger United\r\nNations, a United Nations which embodies the ideals of its\r\nfounders and remains at the same time responsive to the\r\nbasic needs of people everywhere.\r\nMr. SILVA CIMMA (Chile) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I am particularly pleased to congratulate\r\nAmbassador Insanally on his election to the presidency of\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 37\r\nthe General Assembly, which does honour to the Group of\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States. We know that he has\r\nlong-standing close personal ties to Chile.\r\nIt has been our lot to witness and to be a part of events\r\nof far-reaching significance in the history of mankind. The\r\npolitical, technological, economic and social changes that\r\nhave shaken the world over the past 10 years are beginning\r\nto take root, and as they do so the enormous influence they\r\nhave had on the establishment of new forms of behaviour,\r\nnew values and new institutional schemes is becoming\r\napparent.\r\nThe maintenance of democracy as the single paradigm\r\nhas brought with it beneficial influences, although for some\r\nthe establishment of this system of coexistence has given\r\nrise to upheavals which are not yet over. But we can afford\r\na measure of realistic optimism if we fix our attention on\r\nother developments. The beginnings of an agreement\r\nbetween Palestinians and Israelis are a tangible example of\r\nthis. Another is the awakening of South Africa to true\r\ndemocracy. The spirit of consensus that is beginning to\r\nspread throughout the world is a consequence of the\r\ndemocratic paradigm. Against this new backdrop, the\r\nUnited Nations has a vital role to play.\r\nAt this juncture, then, there are grounds for optimism,\r\nand we have a duty to be optimistic. For only in being\r\noptimistic will we be able to overcome the reluctance of\r\nsome and the temptation of others to take refuge in\r\nfundamentalism. It is also imperative for us to take a firm\r\nstand against a kind of rigidity of approach which is gaining\r\nground in the world. This is the tendency to treat systems\r\nas if they were incontrovertible truths. It is the transfer of\r\ndogma to sciences that are not at all exact. And this is\r\nhappening at a time when advances in human knowledge are\r\ndemonstrating precisely that what is vital today is to open\r\nour minds to reason and to distance ourselves as far as\r\npossible from dogmatism.\r\nWe are living in a world which has ceased to be\r\nforeign. No human reality is alien to us. No suffering is\r\nremote. No triumph of intelligence is a private matter. But\r\nglobalization does not mean uniformity. What is more,\r\nwithout respect for differences, it would cease to have the\r\nvigour it exhibits today. Its competitiveness would be lost,\r\nand the concept of one world would inevitably find itself on\r\nits deathbed.\r\nThis is the world in which we have to live and move,\r\na world plagued by disturbing yet, paradoxically, stimulating\r\ncontradictions. It is in such a world that we must strive to\r\nseize the opportunity to take positive initiatives, without\r\nprejudices, and come closer to the innermost reality of man.\r\nThis is why we are now striving to make progress in the\r\ndefence of universal humanitarian law. This concept is\r\ninherent in the new vision of the world, and Chile comes\r\nforward as its most resolute proponent. It is this concept\r\nwhich has led the \"Blue Helmets\" in the past three years to\r\ntake on as many missions as they conducted between the end\r\nof the Second World War and the beginning of the 1990s.\r\nThe United Nations troops serve the invaluable objective of\r\npeacemaking and rebuilding coexistence, a task which we\r\nmust perform if we are to meet adequately the need to strike\r\nthe proper balance between local sensitivity and global\r\nsensitivity.\r\nThe number of problems that are worldwide in scope\r\nhas greatly increased. Whether through rigidity in the\r\napplication of the system or through shortcomings in the\r\nsystem itself, we are witnessing some tragic consequences.\r\nMillions of human beings are suffering from poverty. Nor\r\nis the tragedy confined to the poor nations. We are\r\nwitnessing a worldwide social crisis. It has left its mark on\r\nthe developed countries as well. Social marginalization is a\r\nreality which has taken on truly disturbing dimensions\r\nhitherto unknown in those latitudes.\r\nChile’s present Government has always viewed\r\neconomic development as inseparable from social\r\ndevelopment. We see the economy not as an end in itself,\r\nbut as a means by which humanity can attain happiness.\r\nThis is our objective, and this is what has led President\r\nPatricio Aylwin to assign the priority to dealing with what\r\nwe have termed the social debt. This term encompasses the\r\nrecognition that society as a whole must accord to the poor.\r\nThis idea has gained ground. As a result, the Chilean\r\ninitiative regarding the convening of a world summit for\r\nsocial development has been positively received. The\r\nmeeting, to be held at Copenhagen in 1995, will be a\r\ntangible demonstration of this concern on the part of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMy country is confident that we will make every effort\r\nnecessary to ensure that the Copenhagen meeting arrives at\r\nappropriate and specific solutions. The environment is\r\nfavourable, which makes us feel that we shall be able to\r\nconclude the summit with an \"agenda or programme for\r\npeople\", one essential element of which must be broader,\r\nmore effective and more united international cooperation.\r\nToday’s world poses questions which must be answered\r\nwithout delay. Poverty, hunger and other social scourges are\r\nperceived as aberrations. Their eradication is the task of the\r\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ninternational community as a whole. In this task, the United\r\nNations will play a decisive role. It has the capacity to take\r\nthe leadership, which means channelling international\r\ncooperation.\r\nFurthermore, we recognize that the United Nations has\r\na fundamental role to play in dealing with the relevant\r\nissues.\r\nIn the specific field of international peace and security,\r\nmy country has repeatedly stressed its support for the action\r\ntaken by the Secretary-General, and Chile advocates the\r\nstrengthening of his role, particularly with respect to\r\npreventive diplomacy. We hail his report \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\" as a valuable and significant aid to Governments.\r\nWe look forward with interest to the forthcoming publication\r\nof an agenda for development, which we intend to consider\r\nwith the greatest enthusiasm.\r\nIn the same spirit of cooperation, we have conveyed to\r\nthe Secretary-General suggestions regarding the benefits that\r\nmight derive from an increase in the number of members of\r\nthe Security Council. Because of the great importance of\r\nthat body, any change that is proposed should reflect the\r\nvery clear political will of the majority. I want to put great\r\nemphasis on this point. We view the changes in the Security\r\nCouncil as part of a wide-ranging exercise aimed at\r\nstrengthening the United Nations. No reform can be viable\r\nif its sole aim is to grant some degree of political\r\nrecognition to certain emerging Powers. The aim of our\r\nproposal is that appropriate account be taken of the new\r\ninternational reality. At the same time, it seeks to reflect the\r\nincrease in the membership of the Organization since the last\r\ntime the Council was enlarged.\r\nIn our suggestions to the Secretary-General, we indicate\r\nthe need for the reform to result in a limited membership.\r\nThis will enable us to ensure efficiency and to achieve our\r\nobjectives of democratization. In this context, we feel that\r\nit is important that the various regions of the world be duly\r\nrepresented. This will enable us to combine the idea of\r\ndemocratization with the balance that is essential.\r\nRegarding the right of veto, we agree with many\r\nnations that this is not a democratic means of\r\ndecision-making. For this reason we wish to make it clear\r\nthat we are opposed to its being extended to new permanent\r\nmembers of the Council. In line with these ideas, Chile has\r\nraised the possibility of the Council’s comprising permanent\r\nmembers, permanent members without the right of veto,\r\nregional members with an extended term, and non-permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nStill in the context of the protection of democracy, we\r\ncannot fail to mention that at the regional level too new\r\ncircumstances have led to changes in the instruments\r\navailable to the Organization of American States (OAS).\r\nClear evidence of this is the Santiago \"Commitment to\r\ndemocracy and the renewal of the inter-American system\"\r\napproved at the General Assembly of the OAS held in the\r\ncapital of Chile in 1991. This new approach has already\r\nyielded results. The OAS has achieved successes that would\r\npreviously have been impossible in the region - particularly\r\nin the field of the protection of democracy and human rights.\r\nOf concern to us, together with steps in these two\r\nsensitive areas, is decisive action for the protection of nature.\r\nCurrently, Chile holds the chairmanship of the environment\r\ncommission established within the organization.\r\nIn addition, my country has joined in the effort to\r\ncombat drug trafficking. Accordingly, we support various\r\ninitiatives aimed at drafting new legal instruments to combat\r\nthis scourge effectively.\r\nLikewise - returning to the world scene - we attach\r\nspecial importance to the process of restructuring in the\r\neconomic and social sector. This will raise the possibility of\r\nsaving millions of human beings who are currently\r\nmarginalized, living in minimal security conditions. In our\r\nview, cooperation for development should become one of the\r\nmost solid pillars of the international agenda for the twenty-\r\nfirst century. We shall continue to put forward ideas and to\r\nsupport initiatives, in the Group of 77 and any other body,\r\nthat will serve to advance the negotiations.\r\nPresident Aylwin’s Government has striven to make\r\ninternational cooperation a reality. We have participated in\r\nvarious activities within the programme of technical\r\ncooperation between developing countries. Currently, we\r\nhave projects in 43 countries, and 70 institutions from the\r\npublic and private sectors are participating in them.\r\nThere is an active current of cooperation with our\r\nneighbours in Central America, the Caribbean and South\r\nAmerica. Also under way are projects that link us with\r\nMexico. Similarly, we have programmes with the People’s\r\nRepublic of China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines.\r\nRecently, contacts have been established with African\r\ncountries and with South Pacific island territories. All of\r\nthis forms part of a deliberate policy aimed at strengthening\r\nlinks with the Latin American and Caribbean nations and at\r\nestablishing close ties with all developing countries.\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 39\r\nAn outstanding feature of the major changes taking\r\nplace throughout the world is the important role being\r\nassumed by the Pacific basin in political, economic and\r\nstrategic terms. Chile is a coastal State of that ocean, and\r\nour identification with the basin is one of the most\r\ninnovative elements in the foreign policy being pursued by\r\nPresident Aylwin. We have made a sustained effort to\r\nassociate ourselves with the main agreements on cooperation\r\nin the Pacific region. Since 1990, Chilean business has been\r\nparticipating actively in the Pacific Basin Economic Council,\r\nand since 1991 Chile has been a full member of the Pacific\r\nEconomic Cooperation Council. We hope also to join the\r\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, as we view this\r\nas an important means of promoting the liberalization of\r\nregional and world-wide trade. In this effort we have\r\nreceived valuable support from the States members of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations, and for this we are\r\ngrateful.\r\nIn another context, I cannot fail to take this opportunity\r\nto mention an issue that is of special significance to the\r\ndeveloping world. I refer to the Uruguay Round of the\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The\r\nrenewal of these negotiations provides some grounds for\r\nhope. The so-called Dunkel text is very far from meeting\r\nour legitimate aspirations, although it does constitute a major\r\nadvance in the current situation. Unfortunately, nonetheless,\r\nit embodies a number of limitations on genuine freedom of\r\ntrade.\r\nThe most difficult issue in the Uruguay Round has been\r\ntrade in agricultural products, which, for the nations of Latin\r\nAmerica -for developing countries in general - is of vital\r\nimportance. Hence our lively interest in what is happening\r\nin GATT. Insistence on intransigent positions, which\r\nobjectively impede world trade, creates insurmountable\r\nbarriers to development - a situation to which we cannot\r\nremain indifferent.\r\nChile has fully discharged its commitment to the\r\ncollective security system. We regard this United Nations\r\ninitiative as highly appropriate in the current international\r\nsituation. My country has participated in a number of\r\npeace-keeping operations. It has sent military observers to\r\nthe Middle East and to the frontier between India and\r\nPakistan; police officers to El Salvador; air force personnel\r\nto Kuwait; and army personnel to Cambodia.\r\nIn discussing this issue, we cannot overlook the\r\nfinancing difficulties that peace-keeping operations are\r\nfacing. We support the steps being taken by the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations to overcome these\r\nproblems.\r\nUnquestionably, however, in our view, any discussion\r\nof peace is incomplete if it does not refer to the progress\r\nmade in relation to disarmament. The Convention on\r\nchemical weapons is a significant achievement. We trust\r\nthat the work initiated with a view to the signing of a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty will follow the same\r\ncourse.\r\nAt this forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, I\r\nwish briefly to evaluate the results Chile has achieved in\r\nsome of the areas to which it attaches priority in the\r\nrestoration of democracy.\r\nLet me refer first to our reintegration into the\r\ninternational community. In the multilateral sphere, we can\r\npoint to the generous support of our peers, which has\r\nenabled us to become members of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, the Commission on Human Rights, the International\r\nLaw Commission and the Executive Council of the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and\r\nto the election of our Ambassador to the United Nations,\r\nJuan Somavia, as President of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development.\r\nIn keeping with its mandate, President Aylwin’s\r\nGovernment sees human rights as another of the objectives\r\ntowards which its actions are directed, both domestically and\r\nin foreign policy. The latter aspect reflects a traditional\r\nposition of our country: that of encouraging respect for\r\ninternational law and promoting peace and justice. At the\r\nsame time, however, it is the least we can do by way of\r\nreciprocating the enormous solidarity the international\r\ncommunity has extended to the Chilean people at the most\r\ndifficult moment in its history.\r\nIt will be the task of the General Assembly at this\r\nsession to begin the implementation of the agreements\r\ncontained in the Plan of Action adopted at the second World\r\nConference on Human Rights, held in Vienna at the\r\nbeginning of this year.\r\nAlong with its re-emergence on the international scene\r\nand its protection of human rights and democracy, Chile has\r\nset itself the goal of working for effective regional\r\nintegration.\r\nHere, too, we can point to major achievements. Our\r\nrelations with our Latin American and Caribbean brothers\r\n40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncould not be better. Agreements that have already been\r\nsigned and various others that are in the drafting stage -\r\nsome 220 agreements and treaties in four years - bear\r\nwitness to this fact.\r\nTo that same end, we have worked for the\r\nstrengthening of the Rio Group; we currently have the\r\nhonour to be coordinating its temporary secretariat. That\r\ninstitution is the embodiment of a modern approach to\r\ninternational relations. It embodies the will of the region in\r\nits relations with individual countries or groups of countries\r\noutside the region. This forum for political consensus\r\nalready has significant achievements to its credit on various\r\nlevels. Moreover, it is a clear demonstration of what we can\r\naspire to if we manifest imagination, political openness and\r\nrealism.\r\nSpecial mention needs to be made of the understanding\r\nwe have reached with our neighbours. The understanding,\r\ngenerosity and vision of the future exhibited by the Heads of\r\nState of Argentina, Bolivia, Peru and Chile have allowed us\r\nto settle issues which in some cases had been dragging on\r\nfor more than a century. While respecting our respective\r\ntraditions and abiding by the inviolable principles of\r\ninternational law, including non-intervention and the sanctity\r\nof treaties as the source of rights, we have nevertheless\r\nunderstood that, as the twenty-first century approaches, it\r\nwill be useful to exchange ideas about our national\r\naspirations, inasmuch as they promote the maintenance of\r\npeace.\r\nIt is a great honour for me to be addressing the\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The four\r\nyears I have represented Chile in this important forum,\r\nwhether accompanying President Aylwin or personally, have\r\nbeen an enriching experience.\r\nThe period in which we have the good fortune to be\r\nliving demands increasingly dynamic and effective\r\nresponses. The world is moving towards a new structure\r\nwhich will undoubtedly afford us the possibility of moving\r\never closer to satisfying the needs of human beings. But\r\nwhether we can make this a reality will depend on the\r\nintelligence with which we confront the future.\r\nI have every confidence in the rich sap that nourishes\r\nthis spreading tree, which shelters us all. The United\r\nNations has before it a glorious future in working for the\r\ncause of peace. But that future will be possible only if we\r\ndemonstrate the imagination to be bold, the knowledge to\r\nmove ahead, the love to understand that to strive for the\r\ncommon good is always a viable option, the solidarity to be\r\nmore human and the wisdom not to repeat the mistakes of\r\nthe past.\r\nMembers of the Assembly, my good wishes go with\r\nyou.\r\nMr. ABDOU BOLOCK ABDOU (Djibouti)\r\n(interpretation from French): I wish to take this opportunity\r\nto congratulate Ambassador Insanally on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession. I am confident that his great experience and\r\nwisdom will guarantee the success of this session.\r\nI wish also to pay a tribute to the President of the forty-\r\nseventh session, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria,\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, for his significant achievements and his\r\nconstant, unfailing commitment to the work of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nLet me pay a well-deserved tribute also to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a man ready to face\r\nany challenge and an ardent champion of human rights, for\r\nthe masterly and enlightened way in which he is heading the\r\nSecretariat of the Organization. My country appreciates the\r\ntireless efforts of the office of the Secretary-General as it\r\nstrives to keep the peace throughout the world.\r\nI take great pleasure in welcoming the States that have\r\njust become Members of the United Nations, particularly\r\nEritrea, which by dint of courage, self-denial and sacrifice\r\nhas regained its dignity and its place in the great family of\r\nindependent States.\r\nThe opening of a new session of the General Assembly\r\ngives us an opportunity to share our thoughts on important\r\nworld events and to mark a line of collective conduct in\r\nhuman affairs. The most striking trend over the past few\r\nyears, one which has borne fruit, is that of the protection of\r\nhuman rights vis-à-vis the State. This ideology of human\r\nrights and minority rights has been decisive: today, evils\r\nthat had plagued the international community have\r\ndisappeared or are disappearing, for example the seemingly\r\nunbridgeable ideological gap between East and West, the\r\nsituation in South Africa, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.\r\nEntire regions see the possibility of releasing significant\r\nintellectual and material resources which were once devoted\r\nto preparing for conflict but which now can be used to\r\nestablish genuine, welcome peace.\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 41\r\nWe must hail the courage of visionary leaders who,\r\nfighting against the current, have dared to challenge those\r\nwho saw security concerns as the only political wisdom and\r\nto blaze new trails for their peoples and for the world.\r\nThe sight of the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization and the Prime Minister of Israel signing their\r\nhistoric agreement in Washington, D.C., and shaking hands\r\nwith each other has been for many of us a source of hope,\r\ninspiration and the will to persevere. They deserve our\r\npraise for having recognized each other and engaged in\r\ndialogue, thereby taking the first step down the long road\r\nthat we must now follow to arrive at a viable and lasting\r\npeace.\r\nThat courageous decision shows all those who refuse to\r\nspeak save through the voices of their guns that it is still\r\npossible to break free from the grip of hatred and denial of\r\neach other’s existence.The process that has been set in\r\nmotion in the search for a comprehensive and lasting\r\nsettlement must of necessity be based on Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It deserves the full\r\npolitical and financial support of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn an equally explosive context, the white minority\r\nregime of South Africa has embarked on a process of\r\npolitical reform by signing an agreement for provisional\r\npower sharing with the country’s black majority. That\r\ncrucial measure will have a lasting effect on the political\r\nstability, economic progress and prosperity both of that\r\ncountry and the entire region.\r\nThis development represents a threat to the extremist\r\nand intransigent minorities, which threaten chaos and\r\nanarchy if their demands are not met. However, we are\r\nconvinced that the Government of South Africa and the\r\nAfrican National Congress, acting in a spirit of openness and\r\ncompromise, will oppose any concession or half measure\r\nthat might jeopardize the long march towards a multiracial\r\nand egalitarian society. In that connection, we support the\r\nappeal made by Mr. Mandela that the economic sanctions\r\nimposed upon his country be lifted to facilitate the transition\r\nto democratic rule.\r\nUnfortunately, South Africa is not the only battlefield\r\nfor extremists. We must recognize that Mozambique,\r\nSomalia, Bosnia and Angola, to mention but a few, are still\r\nthe victims of fratricidal conflicts. What we are witnessing\r\nis a phenomenon that was long contained and suppressed by\r\nthe antagonisms that existed between the two power blocs\r\nduring the cold-war period, when super-Power pressures\r\nwere so great that satellite countries were often employed as\r\nintermediaries in the settlement of accounts. As a result,\r\ninternal conflicts were promptly nipped in the bud. Today,\r\nthe concept of two blocs is no longer valid, and\r\nconflagrations are breaking out almost everywhere.\r\nUnfortunately, the task of dealing with these hotbeds of\r\nconflict has fallen to the United Nations, and, as a result, all\r\nnations must now participate in one way or another in the\r\nactivities of the Organization.\r\nWe are convinced that there are other ways of halting\r\nthe renewed outbreak of such conflicts than through a\r\nsystematic recourse to force. Naturally, violations of\r\ninternational law and human values and the ever-increasing\r\ncontempt for human life are of central concern to the\r\ninternational community. However, we must recognize that\r\nthe United Nations is suffering from inadequate structures,\r\nfrom poor organization and from a lack of financing, as well\r\nas from a personnel shortage that renders it impotent to deal\r\nwith such situations. It is therefore vitally important that the\r\nOrganization be provided with the financial and human\r\nresources it needs to remedy its shortcomings.\r\nMy Government believes that the United Nations should\r\nhave its own volunteer rapid-deployment force under\r\nSecurity Council control and the command of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, prepared to be deployed at any time in hotbeds of\r\ntension, for we are constantly being made aware that the best\r\nmethod of dealing with conflicts is to prevent them. We\r\nbelieve in preventive diplomacy. Such a force should be\r\ntrained and armed for limited and defensive actions and\r\nprovided with a logistical support capable of dealing with\r\nany eventuality.\r\nHowever, we are aware of the difficulties such a force\r\nwould face. The principle of humanitarian intervention\r\nwould conflict with the notion of State sovereignty, but at\r\nthe present juncture the United Nations is still the only\r\navailable \"fire department,\" if I may use that term. It is thus\r\nhigh time that its finances were put in order, even if that\r\nentailed granting it the power to seek access to other sources\r\nof financing, while reinforcing integrity and austerity through\r\nthe establishment of a general inspection body.\r\nApart from those financial questions, we believe that\r\nthe United Nations system also needs reform. The Security\r\nCouncil should be expanded by the addition of a permanent\r\nmember for each region, thus modifying the monopoly on\r\nthe right of the veto. Indeed, the United Nations must be\r\nperceived as an international body that expresses the\r\nconcerns of every sovereign country and in which\r\ntransparency and globalization prevail.\r\n42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nAll of those questions arise each time the Organization\r\nintervenes in a given conflict. In Somalia, in Angola, in\r\nMozambique, the Organization has suffered from its inability\r\nto mobilize the military personnel required for the scheduled\r\nperiod, to such an extent that its mission finds itself at a\r\nstandstill. In Angola a tragic situation exists owing to the\r\nOrganization’s inability to disarm the combatants.\r\nFortunately, in Mozambique a spirit of compromise has\r\nprevailed over deadly passions. As for Somalia, the United\r\nStates initiative under the auspices of the Unified Task Force\r\nhas made it possible to avoid an unprecedented disaster.\r\nThe United Nations experience in Somalia is far from\r\nthe negative one it is casually described as being. A mission\r\ndesigned to ensure a safe environment and the distribution\r\nof humanitarian aid has achieved remarkable progress.\r\nHunger exists only in a few remote areas, violence is\r\nsporadic and limited but controlled. Training centres and\r\nhospitals have been opened, and there are signs that business\r\nis beginning to pick up. Political reconciliation meetings\r\nhave been held by the clan leaders in various parts of the\r\ncountry, and the creation of a basic political framework, the\r\ndistrict council, is well under way. We can confidently look\r\nforward to the groundroots development of the regional\r\ncouncil that will elect future political leaders. Somalians are\r\nparticipating to a greater degree in the development process\r\nof planning, identifying and setting priorities.\r\nWe believe that the police services and judicial system\r\nthat will soon be re-established will be capable of assuming\r\na large part of the responsibilities for the maintenance of\r\norder and security in Somalia.\r\nAs a result, we would reiterate our appeal to donors to\r\nfulfil the financial commitments they have made to the\r\nOrganization, because the complete success of the United\r\nNations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) will depend\r\non it. Should they fail to do so, the procrastinations and\r\nfailings of UNOSOM II will be a great encouragement to the\r\nso-called warlords, skilled as they are in clan violence, and\r\ndestroy any chance of the development of democracy and\r\nthe rule of law.\r\nWe would also recall that in its initial desire to bring\r\nabout the prompt restoration of political structures the\r\nOrganization agreed to work with the elements that were\r\navailable, which gave the Somali \"hawks\" an exaggerated\r\nidea of their own importance. It is vital that such detractors\r\nbe stripped of their ability to do harm, so that true\r\ndemocracy can be established. In our opinion, that is the\r\nonly way to avoid getting stuck in a rut of passivity, as has\r\noccurred in the United Nations experience in Bosnia, where\r\nthe worst violations of basic human rights have merely given\r\nrise to expressions of indignation or verbal condemnations,\r\napart from a few resolutions that have remained a dead letter\r\nwhile extortions and \"ethnic cleansing\" continue, in defiance\r\nof international law.\r\nIn addition, the excessive delay in setting up the War\r\nTribunal has only aggravated the morbid passivity of the\r\ninternational community. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that\r\nthat Tribunal will soon begin to hold sessions, with the\r\npersonnel, powers, funding and cooperation of Member\r\nStates that will be vital to its effective operation. We are\r\nstressing this point because we deplore the policy of double\r\nstandards being pursued by the United Nations, a policy that\r\nallows the criminals in Bosnia to operate with impunity\r\nwhile mercilessly pursuing others elsewhere in the world.\r\nThis unquestionably discredits United Nations activities and\r\nexposes collective security to the insatiable appetites of\r\naggressors and warlords of all kinds.\r\nWhen resolutions are adopted, the United Nations must\r\nensure that they are respected and complied with, or\r\n\"collective security\" will come to mean \"selective security\".\r\nUnfortunately, ethnic and community conflicts are not\r\nthe only threats to world peace. The poverty of the\r\ncountries of the third world, compounded by artificial\r\nborders inherited from the colonial era, constitutes another\r\ncatalyst for conflict, because this completely misguided\r\ncarve-up created territorial entities that are scarcely\r\neconomically viable. These countries, once buffer States for\r\nthe super-Powers, have become veritable arsenals, and, with\r\nthe added element of poverty, the regimes in power thus\r\ntend to opt more often for force than for reason.\r\nIn the face of so many constraints, building a\r\nprosperous and harmonious nation with a common identity\r\nand inspired by the values and principles of democracy has\r\nbeen a daunting challenge. Many developing countries\r\nembroiled in internal strife and turmoil have become bogged\r\ndown in chaos, leading to the disintegration of the State.\r\nHence, populations fleeing these regions invade such\r\ncountries as Djibouti, which is currently groaning under the\r\nburden of 130,000 refugees, equivalent to 23 per cent of its\r\npopulation.\r\nWe bear this immense burden nevertheless, because, in\r\nthe end, the only driving force of the great global village\r\nthat the world has become is interdependence. Thus,\r\nassistance to developing countries should be increased, as\r\nshould the provision of skills and technology through\r\nmultilateral cooperation. Furthermore, we believe that\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 43\r\nregional economic integration is the basis for continuing\r\nprogress and lasting prosperity.\r\nWith the emergence of important regional economic\r\nblocs, our countries are threatened with marginalization. In\r\nthe context of economic stagnation, the great hope born of\r\nthe end of the cold war has gone up in smoke. We are still\r\nawaiting the extra resources that might have been allocated\r\nto development. Worse still, the commitment of developed\r\ncountries to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national\r\nproduct - a modest goal set by the United Nations for\r\ndevelopment aid - has been met by only two countries. The\r\nothers have barely managed to achieve 0.2 per cent at the\r\nmost.\r\nDespite a difficult and sometimes chaotic situation, a\r\nnumber of developing countries have made substantial\r\nprogress and present the necessary conditions to benefit from\r\nsignificant and ongoing assistance, while others are regarded\r\nas insolvent by international lending institutions.\r\nIt is obvious that we desperately need increased\r\nmultilateral and bilateral aid to enable us to meet our\r\nbudgetary and investment needs because our private sources\r\nof investment have dwindled. To this gloomy picture we\r\nmust add the misappropriation of aid or mismanagement of\r\nit. Nevertheless, many countries have committed\r\nthemselves to economic reform and structural readjustment,\r\nwhich require increased aid, especially from the international\r\nfinancial institutions.\r\nMy country, responding to the rapid developments\r\ntaking place in international trade and navigation - the bases\r\nof our economy - has revamped its port facilities, financial\r\nservices and communication networks.\r\nAnxious not to sail against what has been called the\r\nwind of democracy, we have undertaken political reforms,\r\nelections have been held and a new Constitution has been\r\nadopted defining and guaranteeing individual rights.\r\nDespite a very hostile and very unstable regional\r\nenvironment, Djibouti has always been an island of stability\r\nand a safe haven. The ill effects of the deep turmoil in our\r\nregion have considerably weakened the Republic of Djibouti,\r\nand the deployment of enormous quantities of armaments in\r\nthe region has not helped to maintain a peaceful climate and\r\nenvironment.\r\nThus, the Republic of Djibouti will come to have its\r\nown share of political troubles, a natural extension of\r\nregional instability. But these troubles will be contained,\r\nbecause Djibouti will strengthen its nation by discouraging\r\nviolence.\r\nSuch are the road taken and the commitment made by\r\nthe Republic of Djibouti to preserve and strengthen peace at\r\nhome and throughout the world.\r\nMr. SERREQI (Albania): I deem it a special pleasure\r\nand honour to extend my cordial congratulations to the\r\nPresident on his election to preside over the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I also wish to express\r\nmy high esteem for the excellent way in which the former\r\nPresident, Mr. Ganev, presided over the proceedings of the\r\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\r\nMay I hail the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and in particular for his dynamic\r\nrole and valuable personal contribution.\r\nThe Albanian delegation takes this opportunity to greet\r\nthe six newest Member States. In particular, we welcome\r\nthe presence here of our neighbour, the Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, whose stability, territorial integrity\r\nand international recognition are of great importance for\r\nstability in the Balkans.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly we have\r\nseen many important events. We have witnessed the\r\nendeavours of peoples for progress, prosperity, harmony and\r\nunderstanding, peace and cooperation, as well as for\r\nsurvival. The end of the cold war paved the way for the\r\nattainment of the peoples’ denied aspirations to\r\nself-determination and national identity, democracy and\r\nequality. It brought their national and spiritual assets closer\r\nto each other and enhanced their endeavours to occupy their\r\nrightful place in the list of civilized nations of the world.\r\nBut these endeavours were also accompanied by crises\r\nand conflicts, which have grown and are now among our\r\nmost serious challenges. We hail with the greatest pleasure\r\ntoday the impressive progress made by Israel and the PLO,\r\nas manifested in the historic agreement to put an end to\r\nyears and years of hostility. This remarkable achievement\r\nis the best proof that if willingness is shown by all parties,\r\na suitable and acceptable solution can always be found. This\r\nis the right moment to recall the worthy contribution made\r\nby the major actors in world diplomacy to this end and\r\nexpress our conviction that with such a commitment they\r\nwill continue to deal with other similar crucial questions.\r\nAt last year’s session of the General Assembly the\r\nAlbanian delegation had the pleasure to declare in this Hall\r\n44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe victory of the democratic forces and their commitment\r\nto Albania’s reintegration into the community of democratic\r\nand civilized nations. Today, from the same rostrum, I have\r\nthe honour and the obligation to state that my country’s\r\ndemocratic transformation has been successful, embracing all\r\nfields and spheres of human activity. This transformation\r\nhas once and for all determined the direction in which\r\nAlbanian society will go, and it is forging ahead fast. After\r\nmore than a year of such government, Albania has taken big\r\nsteps in the setting up of qualitatively new political and\r\nsocial structures and institutions, as well as in the\r\nobservation and legal guarantee of the rights and freedoms\r\nof individuals.\r\nWe can truly speak now of an overall democratic\r\nrestructuring of Albanian society. Our goal is to consolidate\r\nthe constitutional democratic political order by setting up\r\ndemocratic institutions with a view to taking action on\r\nvarious political subjects and non-governmental organizations\r\nwith a view to guaranteeing participation by all citizens in\r\nthe running of the country. Albania is being led by people\r\npossessed of new aspirations, ideologies and ideas. The\r\nGovernment and its programme enjoy general approval,\r\nwhich ensures political stability at home.\r\nMaking headway in Albania along with general\r\ndemocratic reform is economic reform, aimed at a total\r\nrestructuring of a closed and inefficient economy on the path\r\nto a free and open market economy. This restructuring is\r\ndifficult and truly painful, given the conditions of a country\r\nthat had known no reform or any kind of cooperation. The\r\neconomic recession the world is experiencing today has a\r\nconsiderable bearing on the outcome of reform in Albania.\r\nFurthermore, the strict implementation of United Nations\r\nsanctions, and the considerable economic losses consequent\r\nupon it, have influenced the rhythm of Albania’s economic\r\nrecovery. To be successful, Albanian economic policy also\r\ncounts on assistance and cooperation through programmes of\r\nsuch important world economic institutions as the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the\r\nEuropean Community, and on specific programmes of aid\r\nand cooperation with member countries of that Community\r\nand a number of other States. Albania has surpassed the\r\nstage of emergency aid and is working intensively to carry\r\nout capital-producing projects, in which an important role is\r\nalso played by United Nations agencies such as the United\r\nNations Development Programme and the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund. In spite of the fact that the Government\r\nhas been in power for only a short time, positive results are\r\nevident.\r\nApplication of a strict monetary policy has reduced\r\ninflation from a monthly rate of 15 per cent in 1992 to 0.9\r\nper cent in March 1993. Since August of last year, the\r\nAlbanian currency has shown a fairly fixed exchange rate in\r\nrelation to hard currencies, and the budgetary deficit has\r\nbeen reduced significantly. As result of the massive\r\nprivatization of agricultural land, production has increased by\r\n25 per cent.\r\nIt is only natural that at this time Albania has to cope\r\nnot only with the difficulties of transition and world\r\neconomic recession, but with those caused by the long war\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina and other complex political\r\ndevelopments in the region, which negatively affect our\r\nefforts to restore our ruined economy and hinder the\r\npromotion of the democratic process not only in Albania but\r\nin the entire Balkan region. We consider the creation of a\r\ndemocratic space and a climate of peace, security and\r\nstability in the former Yugoslavia and all over the Balkans\r\nto be factors of decisive importance for the future of this\r\nregion, which has been overburdened with so many conflicts.\r\nWe are resolved to contribute constructively to the\r\nestablishment of such a democratic space of peace,\r\nunderstanding and cooperation among the Balkan countries.\r\nThe priority of Albanian foreign policy is the creation\r\nof favourable conditions for the democratic transformation\r\nand total revival of the country. We see the solution of all\r\nour problems precisely in the creation of this democratic\r\nspace in the Balkans and the full incorporation of this region\r\nin the European process of integration. In this context,\r\nAlbania’s permanent political goal remains step-by-step and\r\noverall integration in Europe by encouraging parallel\r\ncooperation with the European collective economic, political\r\nand security forums and structures. Reliable guarantees of\r\naccelerated integration are advanced democratic legislation\r\nworked out in compliance with European standards and the\r\ninstitutional restructuring of State administration and local\r\ngovernment, along with total privatization of the economy\r\nand the general encouragement of local and foreign private\r\ninitiative and activity in Albania. Reference should also be\r\nmade at this point to direct assistance from an important\r\nforum of European democracy, the Council of Europe.\r\nAlbania regards the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\nas an institution of effective vitality, which is indispensable\r\nto organized concrete inter-State cooperation towards a real\r\ncollective security system in Europe and the entire\r\nEuro-Atlantic area. Our relations with this important\r\npolitical and military organization for security in Europe are\r\nintended to constantly enhance cooperation towards full\r\nintegration in its structures. In close cooperation with other\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 45\r\nEuro-Atlantic institutions, the Conference on Security and\r\nCo-operation in Europe and the North Atlantic Cooperation\r\nCouncil also have a very important role to play in\r\nsafeguarding peace, not only through confidence-building\r\nmeasures and increased understanding among the\r\nparticipating states, but also in the prevention of conflicts\r\nand the peaceful settlement of disputes. We are confident\r\nthat only a common security policy is conducive to a climate\r\nof mutual confidence, capable of coping with new\r\nchallenges. Through the position we have expressed at these\r\nforums, Albania has proved that it consistently abides by this\r\nassessment.\r\nThe protection and observance of human rights, one of\r\nthe fundamental issues of the new world democratic order\r\ntoday, are closely linked with stable development,\r\ndemocratic transformation, political stability and international\r\nsecurity, especially of the underdeveloped and turbulent\r\nregions of the world. Human rights are indissolubly\r\ninterwoven with the aspirations of mankind to well-being\r\nand socio-economic and political progress, freedom and\r\ndemocracy. It is imperative for all members of the\r\ninternational community at present to commit themselves,\r\naccording to their respective domestic conditions, to joint\r\nefforts to translate these aspirations into reality for the sake\r\nof a civilized and advanced world. The Albanian people,\r\nwho will never forget the high price paid during half a\r\ncentury of brutal dictatorship, attaches a high value to human\r\nrights and political and civil freedoms. In compliance with\r\nthis assessment, our Government considers support for\r\ndemocracy and human rights to be the guide of its political\r\norientation. It is determined to build a modern State and a\r\ncivilized society, based on respect for the human rights of all\r\nstrata of the population without exception or discrimination.\r\nAlbania has adhered to two basic United Nations pacts on\r\nhuman rights and is making preparations to adhere to a\r\nseries of other conventions. Not long ago, for the first time\r\nin the history of the country, the Albanian Parliament\r\nendorsed the Constitutional Law on Fundamental Rights and\r\nFreedoms, thereby testifying to our determination to put\r\nhuman rights at the forefront of the stable foundations of the\r\nnew Albanian democratic society we are building.\r\nWe consider respect for minority rights to be an\r\nimportant and indivisible aspect of human rights. Albania’s\r\npolicy in this field rests on the principles of full equality and\r\nnon-discrimination, the creation of a broad democratic space\r\nso that persons belonging to national minorities can assert\r\ntheir own national identity, and the creation of a climate of\r\nexemplary trust and coexistence. Minorities are an integral\r\npart of the political, social and economic life of Albania; as\r\nprotagonists of the democratic development and\r\ntransformation of the country, they have access to real\r\nrepresentation in all socio-political structures, at State and\r\nlocal levels of administration. Their situation in economic\r\nand social domains will improve hand in hand with that of\r\nthe rest of the population.\r\nThe end of the cold war freed mankind from the fear of\r\nglobal confrontation, even though peace and security are still\r\nseriously threatened by a number of regional conflicts. In\r\nsome regions of the world, the actions and practices of some\r\nStates where totalitarian and ultranationalist regimes are in\r\npower run counter to the aspirations and endeavours of the\r\npeace-loving international community. More than 30 armed\r\nconflicts, accompanied by savage crimes and great suffering\r\nfor the civilian population, are currently ablaze in various\r\nregions of the world. These conflicts, which are a flagrant\r\nviolation of human rights and which are attended by all the\r\ninevitable consequences, have seriously shocked mankind.\r\nThe conflict in the former Yugoslavia, especially in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, which is the bloodiest and most\r\ndangerous conflict known in Europe since the Second World\r\nWar, has not yet found a stable solution. The monstrous\r\nmassacres carried out against the innocent civilian\r\npopulation, \"ethnic cleansing\" - that barbaric form of\r\ngenocide - and all the other inhuman acts associated with\r\nthis conflict have once more testified to the fact that it is\r\nimpossible to reform totalitarian and ultra-nationalist\r\nsocieties. This conflict is a challenge to civilized Europe, to\r\nthe conscience and humanitarian sentiments and passions of\r\nthe whole of peace-loving mankind. That is why a firm\r\ncollective answer from mankind is required. We have seen\r\nthat the imposition of sanctions, despite the effect on the\r\nSerbian economy, was not the only or the most effective\r\nmeans to put an end to the war and restore peace. This is\r\nbecause the practical commitment of some countries did not\r\nmatch their verbal statements in support of the sanctions.\r\nThat is why sanctions failed to paralyse and seriously\r\ndamage the Serbian war machine. Time has proved that the\r\nsanctions needed to be accompanied by other, simultaneous,\r\nmeasures of pressure.\r\nWe think that a convincing example should be set for\r\neverybody, demonstrating that the reaction and the stand of\r\nthe United Nations will always be the same in cases of\r\naggression. It is the Organization’s duty to use all means at\r\nits disposal to implement the principles of the Charter, to\r\nmake peace, and to fulfil the hopes of mankind.\r\nBut we understand that the United Nations sanctions, as\r\nthe only means based on the world community’s consensus,\r\nwill continue to be applied, putting the necessary pressure on\r\n46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe Belgrade authorities until a final solution of the whole\r\nYugoslav crisis is found, including an overall improvement\r\nof the situation in Kosovo.\r\nThe Yugoslav crisis is multidimensional and\r\ncomplicated because of many interlacing factors and\r\ninterests. It is evident that its most tragic and bloodiest\r\nmanifestation is the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nwhich for more than a year has been the centre of the\r\nattention and the efforts of public opinion and of the\r\ndiplomacy of the major Powers of the world. I would like\r\nto stress that my country has condemned the Serbian\r\naggression, and has hailed and unreservedly supported all the\r\nendeavours of the international community to establish peace\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Republic of Albania will\r\nsupport any solution to the Bosnian conflict which is based\r\non a free and fair agreement. Solutions which legalize\r\nterritorial annexation and \"ethnic cleansing\" at the expense\r\nof other peoples such as the Muslim population in Bosnia\r\ncan hardly be heralds of peace.\r\nMoreover, we would like to remind this important\r\ninternational forum that the other aspects of the Yugoslav\r\ncrisis should not be neglected either, for these could have\r\nconsequences of tragic proportions not only within the\r\nformer Yugoslavia but also in the Balkans and beyond.\r\nIn that light, I would like to point out that the Albanian\r\nfactor in the former Yugoslavia, especially the Kosovo issue,\r\nis of a crucial importance to finding an equitable and lasting\r\nsolution to the crisis. Therefore, we insist that this problem\r\nhas to be properly addressed. If, in assessing this factor,\r\nthere is insistence on the rigid position that Kosovo is an\r\nintegral part of Serbia, that it is annexed to Serbia and that\r\nthe Albanian people in the former Yugoslavia are a minority,\r\nthen nothing will be achieved, but the idea of creating a\r\n\"Greater Serbia\" will be reconfirmed and legalized at the\r\nexpense of other peoples.\r\nWe think that the breakup of the former Yugoslavia -\r\nwhich was also the cause of what is now called the\r\nYugoslav crisis - puts the issue of succession in the former\r\nYugoslav federation in an entirely new light: it brings up\r\nthe question of considering the peoples’ right of\r\nself-determination, and the expression of their free will as to\r\ntheir political status. If this means war, as some people\r\nthink, then it is up to the United Nations and the Security\r\nCouncil to intervene and guarantee respect for the principles\r\nof the Charter. We firmly maintain that no forcible change\r\nof borders or territorial gains through aggression and \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\" will be recognized.\r\nThe choice is clear: if we want people to believe in the\r\nnew world order, we must create all the legitimate\r\ninternational conditions needed to realize and defend their\r\naspirations, by setting up an entirely new type of system of\r\nUnited Nations protection for defenceless countries and\r\npeoples.\r\nAs to the national question of the Albanians, we see its\r\nsolution in the creation in the former Yugoslavia and all\r\nover the Balkans of a broad democratic space that would\r\nallow freedom of communication and freedom of movement\r\namong the more than 7 million Albanians who live, in\r\nterritorial continuity, in that space. We are against territorial\r\nfragmentation and division, and the hermetic sealing of a\r\nsingle people within the borders of neighbouring countries.\r\nI believe that I am also expressing the opinion of many\r\ncountries represented here when I say that the outbreak of a\r\nconflict in Kosovo would be the start of a great tragedy.\r\nAlbania expresses its profound gratitude to the international\r\ncommunity for all the efforts it has made to prevent a\r\nspillover of the conflict to Kosovo and to support the denied\r\nrights of the Albanian people there. I also express my\r\ngratitude to the United Nations, which has clearly warned\r\nthat any warlike act by Serbia in Kosovo will pose a threat\r\nto international peace and security. We highly appreciate\r\nthis support and call for a serious commitment by the\r\ninternational community to take all the necessary urgent\r\nmeasures to prevent the Bosnian tragedy from recurring in\r\nKosovo.\r\nAlbania has long made it clear that placing Kosovo\r\nunder the control and protection of the United Nations is the\r\nonly guaranteed way of preventing conflict and discouraging\r\nthe silent \"ethnic cleansing\" that Serbia is practising there.\r\nIt would also create a favourable climate for dialogue\r\nbetween the legitimate Albanian representatives of Kosovo\r\nand the Serbian authorities on the political status of the\r\nprovince and on any other issue linked with the question of\r\nsuccession to the former Yugoslavia.\r\nTherefore, we reiterate our stand that only the United\r\nNations, and primarily the Security Council, should\r\nexpeditiously take the necessary measures to prevent conflict\r\nin that region.\r\nAt a time when the concept of using peace-keeping\r\nforces prior to a conflict has been consolidated in theory and\r\nhas been put into practice, preventive deployment is fully\r\njustified in the case of Kosovo, because of the threat that the\r\noutbreak of an intra-Balkan armed conflict would pose to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 47\r\nWe are profoundly concerned about the issue of\r\nKosovo and the grave situation created there since the\r\nelimination of its autonomy in 1989 and its complete\r\nannexation and subjection to Serbian military and police\r\nauthority, and we call for proper attention to the fact that a\r\npeaceful settlement of the Yugoslav crisis should cover the\r\nentire space of the former Yugoslavia and all its aspects and\r\nproblems. Any partial settlement without the necessary\r\ninternational safeguards would be unstable and would not do\r\naway with the germs of new conflicts.\r\nTo sum up, I would like to reiterate that the Republic\r\nof Albania sees in the United Nations an organization\r\ncapable of implementing the principles of its Charter and\r\ncoping with all the challenges that result from the dynamic\r\ndevelopments of our time, especially serious problems in the\r\nfields of security, disarmament, sustainable socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, environment and so on.\r\nWe see the United Nations also as the primary\r\ninstitution responsible for the collective safeguarding of\r\npeace and security in the new era. Albania will render\r\nunreserved support to all initiatives aimed at enhancing the\r\nefficiency of this universal Organization.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.45 p.m.\r\n"
