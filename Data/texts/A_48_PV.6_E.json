"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n6th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nWednesday, 28 September 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.40 a.m.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to apologize for this\r\nlate start, but, as members know, the Secretary-General and\r\nI sometimes have duties of protocol. I do encourage\r\nmembers to maintain their punctuality.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. ISLAM A. KARIMOV, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan.\r\nMr. Islam A. Karimov, President of the Republic of\r\nUzbekistan, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Islam Karimov, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident KARIMOV (interpretation from Russian):\r\nMay I express my gratitude for the honour of representing\r\nfor the first time, as Head of State, the independent country\r\nof Uzbekistan at the United Nations General Assembly.\r\nWe see the United Nations as a unique institution for\r\nthe discussion and solution of the most urgent issues facing\r\nall States and regions and the world community at large.\r\nThe United Nations is a great symbol of the good will of\r\nnations to live in peace and accord has become a clear sign\r\nof mankind’s spiritual progress. At a time of radical historic\r\ntransformation and growing interdependency in the modern\r\nworld, the global role and significance of the United Nations\r\nis growing correspondingly as a political instrument for the\r\nworld in the consideration and solution of common human\r\nproblems.\r\nIndependent Uzbekistan, recognized by all States, has\r\nnow become a full-fledged member of the United Nations.\r\nEmbassies of many countries and offices of various\r\ninternational agencies have been opened in the Republic. I\r\nam pleased to acknowledge the fruitful activities of the\r\nUnited Nations Office in Uzbekistan, the opening of which\r\nwas undertaken on the personal initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity, on behalf of my\r\npeople and the Government of Uzbekistan, to express sincere\r\ngratitude to the United Nations and all its Member States for\r\ntheir recognition and support of my country’s independence.\r\nUzbekistan, with its population of 22 million,\r\nconstitutes both the geographical and political basis of\r\nCentral Asia. One of the most ancient world civilizations\r\nemerged in the region, and this land was crossed by the\r\nGreat Silk Road. The history of my people goes back deep\r\ninto the past, being more than 3,000 years old. Once-\r\nprosperous empires and kingdoms in the territory of ancient\r\nTuran, Transoxania and Turkistan had a marked impact on\r\nthe development of world culture.\r\nThe cities of Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara and Khiva\r\nhave been known far and wide since time immemorial and\r\nhave had trade links stretching from China to Spain and\r\nfrom Europe to the Indian Ocean. These cities were noted\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86617 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.6\r\n5 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nfor magnificent architectural structures and attracted\r\noutstanding thinkers, scholars and artists from all parts of the\r\nworld. The great Tamerlane turned Samarkand into a capital\r\ncity of his empire and was famous as a patron of scholars,\r\nphilosophers, architects, poets and musicians. Spiritual,\r\nintellectual and aesthetic values have had a profound effect\r\nin shaping the way of life and traditional culture of our\r\npeople. We are proud of our history and revere the memory\r\nof our great ancestors, the thinkers of the East: Al-Bukhari,\r\nAl-Termezi, Ahmad Yassavi, Bahaudin Naqshbandi,\r\nAl-Kworazmi, Beruni, Avicenna, Nawai, Ulugh Beg and\r\nmany others who made an invaluable contribution to world\r\ncivilization.\r\nHaving declared its independence, Uzbekistan has now\r\nentered an era of spiritual and intellectual renaissance and\r\nradical transformation in the economic, political and social\r\nspheres. We have embarked on the building of a\r\ndemocratic, lawful and secular society with an open-market\r\neconomy and a strong system of social welfare. There is\r\nconsent among the people of Uzbekistan on the need,\r\ndirections and forms of developing political institutions, and\r\nthere is now perceptible progress towards democratic\r\ntransformation. The new Fundamental Law of the Republic\r\nof Uzbekistan, adopted last December, has been highly\r\nreceived by independent international experts and meets the\r\nessential criteria of a democratic constitution while ensuring\r\nall human rights and basic freedoms of citizens. Free and\r\ncontested general elections have been held for Head of State\r\nand the Parliament. There is a clear separation of powers in\r\nthe country, and the multi-party system is gaining strength.\r\nOur people have regained their freedom following more\r\nthan 100 years of oppression and now have an opportunity\r\nto decide their own destiny, develop their culture and bring\r\nabout their spiritual renaissance. The Republic, inhabited by\r\npeople of more than 100 nations and nationalities, provides\r\nall ethnic groups with broad and equal opportunities for the\r\ndevelopment of their national cultures, traditions and\r\nlanguages. We are proud that, despite the difficulties of\r\ntransition, Uzbekistan has been able to preserve political\r\nstability, peace and ethnic accord.\r\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan is a country of great\r\npotential, unique natural resources and a promising future.\r\nAbout half of its population is below the age of 18. It is\r\nthird in the world in cotton production, eighth in gold\r\nextraction, tenth in the production of copper and is among\r\nthe leading nations in deposits of rare metals and strategic\r\nraw materials. Uzbekistan possesses huge energy resources\r\nand has much more to offer the world market. It has long\r\ntraditions of craftsmanship, trade, commerce and farming\r\nand is a great country for tourism. The Republic has a\r\npowerful scientific, intellectual and spiritual potential.\r\nResearch carried out by our scientists in the fields of\r\nmathematics, physics and biology has won renown far\r\nbeyond the region. But our principal wealth is an open,\r\nhard-working, hospitable and proud people noted for its\r\nsense of honour and dignity.\r\nFree Uzbekistan has chosen its own path to reforming\r\nsociety and has elaborated its own model for transition to a\r\ndemocratic society and a free market economy. At the same\r\ntime, we are quite aware that the Republic - which earlier\r\nserved as a raw-materials appendage of the former Soviet\r\nUnion, exporting cheap raw materials and importing\r\nlow-quality finished products - with a hypertrophied\r\neconomy and devastated environment, can hardly be\r\nexpected to overcome in a short span of time the situation it\r\nhas inherited. Given the high birth rate, acute problems of\r\nemployment and considerable material difficulties, economic\r\nand spiritual development can be expected to outstrip\r\npolitical transformation. We must work out a solid legal\r\nfoundation, educate people in living in a law-abiding society,\r\nencourage tolerance of diverse views and opinions and,\r\nabove all, change the mentality of the people, whose outlook\r\nwas shaped by the command-administrative and\r\ntotalitarian-distributive system we lived under for the last\r\n74 years.\r\nAny other approach, or a thoughtless acceleration of\r\nevents, may lead to conflicts and civil confrontation in many\r\ncountries of the former socialist camp. As we have seen,\r\nsuch approaches have led to civil confrontation, inter-ethnic\r\nclashes and the further proliferation of problems, rather than\r\nto their solution, and may discredit the very idea of a free -\r\nmarket economy and democratic reform. This can be seen\r\nquite clearly from the examples of those countries that are\r\nnow going through a very difficult time in their history. It\r\nhas become evident today that there are no universal models\r\nof social and economic development that are equally\r\nacceptable to all countries. There seems to remain no\r\nmarked difference between the orthodox concepts of\r\ncapitalism and socialism. The need has emerged to shape\r\nnew and free thinking without ideological indoctrination,\r\nwhich would reveal the entire diversity of the forms and\r\nways for each country’s transition to an entirely new\r\ncondition.\r\nTaking into consideration the concrete situation,\r\nmentality and traditions of the Uzbek people, we have\r\nproclaimed five basic principles of our reform. First, we\r\nhave proclaimed the priority of the economy over politics\r\nand the de-ideologization of both domestic and external\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 3\r\neconomic relations. Secondly, we consider that the State\r\nneeds to play the role of main reformer and initiator of\r\ndemocratic transformation in our Republic during the\r\ntransition period. Thirdly, we proclaim the preservation of\r\nlaw and order and the supremacy of law. Fourthly, we\r\nbelieve it is of exceptional importance to have a strong\r\nsocial policy protecting the interests of all citizens, especially\r\nthe neediest and those requiring Government support.\r\nFinally, we believe the transition to free-market relations will\r\nhave to be carried out gradually, on an evolutionary basis.\r\nA popular saying in our country goes, \"Never destroy the old\r\nhouse before you have built a new one.\"\r\nSocial stability and State security are vital factors in\r\ndemocratic reform. Hardly any other problem can be solved\r\nwithout them. Uzbekistan has steadfastly and consistently\r\nsupported security and stability in all regions, especially in\r\nour own, Central Asia. The specific characteristics of our\r\nregion and its geopolitical situation are such that negative\r\ndevelopments may trigger world-wide instability. Suffice it\r\nto say that about 60 million people associated with various -\r\nand I stress, various - ethnic and religious groups live in\r\nCentral Asia. Both nuclear and conventional arms of\r\ntremendous destructive force have been accumulated in this\r\nregion, and any violence may result in disasters of\r\nunforeseeable magnitude.\r\nIn this connection, one cannot avoid discussing the\r\nsituation in Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border. One\r\ncould argue about the political interests of the parties\r\ninvolved; however, there is no doubt that the bloody conflict\r\nin Tajikistan has arisen as a result of the unlawful efforts of\r\none of the sides to seize power through the force of arms\r\nand intimidation and maintain it on the basis of continued\r\nmaterial and ideological interference from the outside. Thus,\r\nnumerous political forces and different parts of the\r\npopulation have become involved in this armed conflict. It\r\nhas been internationalized also because financial and\r\nlogistical support of anti-government fighting units with\r\nmilitary equipment, as well as training centres, were located\r\nbeyond the borders of Tajikistan.\r\nThe Government of Uzbekistan is concerned at the\r\ncontinued conflict in Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan\r\nborder, primarily because for centuries the peoples of Central\r\nAsia have been linked by close economic, spiritual and\r\ncultural relations. At the present time, there are in essence\r\nno real borders in the classical sense among the countries of\r\nthe region. That is why any outbreak of conflict for purely\r\ngeographical reasons may affect the whole region.\r\nWe are also concerned at the uncontrolled accumulation\r\nof modern arms in huge quantities. Where do they come\r\nfrom, and who is arming the extremists and terrorists? What\r\nis the world community doing, and what should it do to\r\nprevent the flow of arms into zones of fratricidal conflict?\r\nThese burning issues, which affect millions of people and\r\nentire nations, are awaiting a solution.\r\nThe problem of Tajik refugees has become extremely\r\nserious as their conflict escalates. Tens of thousands of\r\npeaceful people have been compelled to leave their homes.\r\nUzbekistan is sending food products, medicine and other\r\nvital necessities to Tajikistan and is encouraging the return\r\nof the refugees, and through the United Nations office\r\nsupports the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees for the rendering of humanitarian assistance.\r\nUzbekistan resolutely condemns extremism, terrorism,\r\nreligious fanaticism and fundamentalism in any form. It is\r\nin favour of the peaceful resolution of conflicts by political\r\nmeans, of holding negotiations between opposing parties, and\r\nof non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States,\r\nand it is prepared to render further humanitarian assistance\r\nto the Tajik people, primarily to refugees returning from\r\nAfghanistan. In the early stages of the conflict in Tajikistan,\r\nUzbekistan twice drew the attention of the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to the\r\nurgent need for thorough consideration of the situation and\r\nits settlement within the framework of the United Nations.\r\nWe are grateful to the United Nations and to the\r\nSecretary-General for their prompt response to the concern\r\nwe expressed and for their efforts to settle the conflict. We\r\nbelieve that the international community will properly\r\nappreciate this contribution to peace. A United Nations\r\nmission headed by Mr. Kittani, the Secretary-General’s\r\nSpecial Envoy, has been working fruitfully in the region.\r\nData collected by the mission have, in our view, provided\r\nan opportunity to draw objective conclusions as to the nature\r\nand the driving forces of the conflict at a meeting of the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council.\r\nNevertheless, there is hardly any basis today on which\r\nto talk about sufficient attention being paid to the situation\r\non the Tajik-Afghan border in the light of the current\r\nsituation in Tajikistan as well as in Afghanistan. We have\r\nnot understood the scale and potential of this conflict and its\r\nglobally devastating consequences. I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to appeal to participants in this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to express their constructive views on\r\nways of solving this problem.\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nUzbekistan would welcome the convening of a standing\r\nUnited Nations seminar on security, stability and cooperation\r\nin Central Asia. Tashkent, a city with peacemaking\r\ntraditions, steeped in the spirit of international cooperation\r\nand ethnic accord, is prepared to be the venue for this\r\nseminar. In accordance with Article 52 of the United\r\nNations Charter, the parties involved could discuss, within\r\nthe framework of the United Nations seminar, the\r\npossibilities of setting up an effective system of regional\r\nsecurity in Central Asia.\r\nSuch a system could contemplate measures for the\r\npreservation and restoration of peace in case of conflicts and\r\nwars, including collective sanctions of a diplomatic,\r\nfinancial, economic and other nature against those who\r\ntoday would venture to violate peace and existing borders,\r\nand produce recommendations for the United Nations on the\r\nestablishment of stability and lasting peace in this region.\r\nUzbekistan supports the idea of a new role for the\r\nUnited Nations as a global institution in safeguarding\r\nsecurity on Earth, which was advanced by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nin his \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277), which he outlined\r\nin the Security Council on 31 January 1992. We invite the\r\nSecretary-General to pay a visit to the Central Asian region,\r\nincluding the Republic of Uzbekistan. I am sure that the\r\nauthority of the United Nations and the Secretary-General\r\nwill make it possible to prevent the negative development of\r\nevents in the region.\r\nIn \"An Agenda for Peace\", Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali\r\nattaches great importance to preventive diplomacy in today’s\r\nworld, which coincides fully with our own view. From this\r\nlofty international rostrum, I wish to call upon the United\r\nNations to strengthen further its peacemaking work,\r\nspecifically in zones of emerging conflicts.\r\nIt must unfortunately be admitted that, in many cases,\r\nauthoritative international agencies react to conflict situations\r\nnot when - speaking figuratively - they smell smoke, but\r\nonly afterwards, when the fire has already flared up and is\r\nalmost impossible to put out. To prevent the escalation of\r\nconflicts, the international community should abandon the\r\nrole of passive observer it so often plays and instead adopt\r\nthe stance of an active peacemaker.\r\nIt would be expedient in this regard to establish a\r\nspecial group under the United Nations Security Council to\r\nanalyse and forecast emerging international conflicts for the\r\npurpose of rapidly preparing recommendations for the\r\nSecurity Council, other United Nations agencies and the\r\nworld community so that the necessary measures can be\r\ntaken.\r\nCurrent realities in the world today show that the\r\nsecurity of one nation cannot be guaranteed at the expense\r\nof another State and that regional security can be viewed\r\nsolely in concert with global security. On this basis,\r\nUzbekistan is in favour of the total abolition of nuclear\r\nweapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons will have to become a more efficient treaty,\r\nunrestricted by any time limits. Our Republic will actively\r\nparticipate in preliminary negotiations for the preparation of\r\na conference on the prolongation of this Treaty. Uzbekistan\r\nis a staunch supporter of proclaiming Central Asia a\r\nnuclear-free zone.\r\nWe are firmly determined also to hold negotiations on\r\nsigning the chemical weapons Convention. Uzbekistan\r\nconsiders that we need international control over the\r\nproliferation of chemical and bacteriological weapons in\r\nCentral Asia.\r\nI should like to draw particular attention, among other\r\ntop-priority problems, to the question of stepping up our\r\ncommon efforts against narcobusiness. We would like to see\r\na large-scale cooperation in the struggle against this scourge,\r\nthis white death. It is a secret to no one that a large\r\npercentage of the narcotics consumed throughout the world\r\nare produced in and transported through Central Asia.\r\nConcentration of narcobusiness in a single region alone\r\nprovides sufficient ground for the world community to focus\r\nits efforts on the elimination of this horrible business.\r\nUzbekistan is ready to cooperate in this area with all\r\ninterested countries and organizations. We would welcome\r\nthe establishment, under the aegis of the United Nations, of\r\na regional commission on Central Asia for the coordination\r\nof joint efforts in the fight against narcobusiness.\r\nWe also favour greater United Nations involvement in\r\ncontrolling the environment and preventing global ecological\r\ndisasters, and we are ready to facilitate the implementation\r\nof that noble mission by all available means.\r\nLike so many regions of the planet, Central Asia faces\r\nan ecological disaster on an unprecedented scale. First and\r\nforemost, there is the tragedy of the Aral Sea. In recent\r\nyears it has lost two thirds of its volume, its water table has\r\nshrunk by half and its shoreline has retreated 80 kilometers,\r\nthe content of mineral salts has increased fourfold, 2 million\r\nhectares of arable land have become desert, and sandstorms\r\nrange at distances greater than 300 kilometers from it. All\r\nthis adversely affects the sanitary and health situation in the\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 5\r\nregion. In its ecological and socio-economic consequences,\r\nthe problem of the Aral Sea, according to United Nations\r\nexperts, is one of the major calamities of the twentieth\r\ncentury.\r\nThe death of the Aral Sea may have unpredictable\r\naffects the whole world. We appeal to the world community\r\nto render assistance in saving the Aral Sea and the adjoining\r\nzone. In light of the global nature of this disaster,\r\nUzbekistan would appreciate the establishment of a United\r\nNations special commission on the Aral Sea which, in\r\ncoordination with the region’s Governments, and through\r\nUnited Nations channels, would attract international\r\nresources and opportunities for the solution of this ecological\r\ntragedy. As a first step, this commission could hold an\r\ninternational conference under United Nations aegis in\r\nNukus, bordering on the Aral Sea.\r\nUzbekistan became independent at the end of the cold\r\nwar. This new epoch requires a new and sober assessment\r\nof all problems facing the United Nations and the world\r\ncommunity. We are concerned by the growing suspicion\r\nbetween the advanced countries of the North and the\r\ndeveloping countries of the South. We regret that the former\r\nideological intolerance between East and West is now being\r\nreplaced by ethnic and religious intolerance. We are also\r\nconcerned about the growing trend towards fundamentalism,\r\nextremism and terrorism.\r\nIn our view, under the circumstances, the United\r\nNations should be the world’s principal tool for the\r\nprevention of new hotbeds of confrontation which could\r\njeopardize human progress. We believe that urgent and\r\neffective measures are now necessary so that a key organ of\r\nthe United Nations - the Security Council - can adequately\r\nreflect the socio-economic, ethno-cultural, religious and\r\nspiritual diversity of today’s world; its currently conservative\r\nstructure should be reconsidered.\r\nThe world’s nations are on the threshold of a new\r\nmillennium. They want to face a bright, promising future\r\nand leave behind the cataclysms of past global ideological\r\nconfrontation. There is growing conviction that there is no\r\nalternative to peace, cooperation and universal security.\r\nWhat will the future of mankind be like? What kind of\r\nnew era is opening? Will it succeed in overcoming the\r\nheavy legacy of the past? Will it achieve openness and\r\nsincerity in inter-State relations, eliminating mutual\r\nsuspicion, distrust and diktat, particularly the latter? The\r\nfuture of the community of nations depends on the answers\r\nto these questions. Uzbekistan is determined to progress\r\nsteadily towards the achievement of its national objectives,\r\nin harmony with the common interests of the world\r\ncommunity and the deep democratic processes that\r\ncharacterize the current level of its development. The Uzbek\r\npeople are aware that hard times still lie ahead but they are\r\nassured of a great future in the single family of mankind.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Islam A. Karimov, President of the Republic of\r\nUzbekistan, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. MAHAMANE OUSMANE,\r\nPRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE NIGER\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of the Niger.\r\nMr. Mahamane Ousmane, President of the Republic\r\nof the Niger, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic\r\nof the Niger, His Excellency Mr. Mahamane Ousmane, and\r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident OUSMANE (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the Niger and its people, I wish to extend my\r\nwarmest salutations to this distinguished Assembly. It is\r\ntruly with great pleasure that I am taking part in the general\r\ndebate of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nAs the first democratically elected President of the\r\nNiger, I have come to bring members and all the peoples\r\nrepresented here a message of esteem and friendship,\r\ngoodwill and cooperation from the people of the Niger. I\r\nhave come to express the pride of the people of the Niger in\r\nbelonging to the great family of the United Nations. I have\r\ncome to reassert its powerful and sincere faith in the ideals\r\nand principles expressed in the United Nations Charter. I\r\nhave come to share its anxieties and concerns with members\r\nand to state our determination to join with all the members\r\nof the Assembly in the efforts to build a better world for\r\npresent and future generations.\r\nFirst, however, may I join the speakers who have\r\npreceded me in extending to you, Mr. President, our sincere\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncongratulations on your well-deserved election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nBy unanimously giving you the heavy task of guiding\r\nits work, the General Assembly pays a well-deserved tribute\r\nto your skills and to your country, Guyana, for its invaluable\r\ncontribution to the efforts of the United Nations to achieve\r\nits noble ideals. Of course, I also congratulate the other\r\nmembers of the Bureau, who I am certain will spare no\r\neffort to support you in the successful accomplishment of\r\nyour difficult functions. I also assure you of the full\r\ncooperation of the Niger delegation.\r\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, I\r\nexpress the compliments of the Niger delegation for the\r\ncompetence, efficiency and tact with which he presided over\r\nthe work of the last session.\r\nFinally, I pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the fresh dynamic he has\r\nbrought to the United Nations, with a firm commitment to\r\ninternational development, peace and security. This work\r\nsince his election to the head of the world Organization\r\nclearly reflects our concerns. On behalf of Niger, I warmly\r\ncongratulate him.\r\nFrom 29 July to 3 November 1991 the active elements\r\nof the nation of Niger held a National Supreme Conference,\r\nwhich was a historic opportunity to consider the results of\r\nNiger’s 30 years of independence and lay the foundations for\r\nfurther efforts to strengthen the cohesiveness and unity of\r\nour people and guarantee them the conditions for sustained\r\nand harmonious development.\r\nFollowing that Conference, Niger resolutely set forth on\r\nthe path of democratization, to build for our people a State\r\nof law founded on the principles of pluralist democracy and\r\ncommitted to observing and guaranteeing respect for human\r\nrights as defined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights and in the 1981 African Charter of Human\r\nand National Rights.\r\nAs a prelude to the democratization process, the people\r\nof Niger, by an overwhelming majority, adopted in a\r\nreferendum on 26 December 1992 the Constitution of the\r\nThird Republic, which guarantees the human rights set out\r\nin various international instruments and enshrines the\r\nseparation of powers between the executive, legislative and\r\njudiciary branches. Furthermore, the Constitution contains\r\nmany other innovative elements, such as providing for the\r\nestablishment of a high council of communication, an\r\nindependent administrative body to ensure and guarantee the\r\nfreedom and independence of the communications media and\r\nfair access for political parties, associations and citizens to\r\nofficial means of information and communications.\r\nThe Constitution of 26 December 1992 proclaims\r\nNiger’s commitment to spare no effort to achieve the ideal\r\nof African unity, as well as its willingness to cooperate in\r\nfriendship and equality with all peoples devoted to peace,\r\njustice and freedom.\r\nOnce the Constitution was adopted the people of Niger\r\nwent to the polls on 14 February 1993 to elect the 83\r\nDeputies of the National Assembly, the legislative body of\r\nthe Third Republic. This Assembly is in every way\r\nrepresentative of the ethnic diversity of our people and its\r\npolitical points of view. Indeed, through the creation of\r\nspecial districts during the elections, in addition to the\r\nregular administrative districts, every ethnic group in Niger\r\nis today represented in the National Assembly. The\r\ngovernment majority is made up of an alliance of nine\r\npolitical groups, while the opposition is made up of a\r\ngrouping of three parties holding 33 of the 83 seats in the\r\nNational Assembly.\r\nThe democratization process undertaken by my country\r\nwas completed by the holding, from 14 to 27 March 1993,\r\nof two-stage presidential elections, in which eight political\r\ngroups took part. The result was that the people of Niger\r\nentrusted me with the onerous task of leading them into the\r\nfuture. It is important to note that throughout the process\r\nthe people of Niger demonstrated great maturity and behaved\r\nin an exemplary manner. Tens of thousands participated,\r\ntravelling great distances and braving the extreme\r\ntemperatures that are typical of Saharan Africa. They took\r\npart in a calm, peaceful and disciplined manner, always\r\nmaintaining the very powerful feelings of brotherhood and\r\nof belonging to a single nation that unite them. Such\r\nconduct, which I am happy to praise once again here, earned\r\nthe people of Niger the esteem, consideration and respect of\r\nthe hundreds of international observers from all over the\r\nworld who monitored the elections and attested to their\r\nfairness and openness.\r\nThe people of Niger thus made its choice, deciding that\r\ndemocracy would be the framework of its future. This\r\nchoice is, to be sure, in keeping with the changing times, in\r\nkeeping with the direction of history. But we know that\r\ndemocratization is a long-term undertaking requiring patience\r\nand selflessness. The great democratic nations of today\r\nthemselves travelled a long road before reaching their\r\ncurrent stage of development.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 7\r\nYoung nations such as Niger which have firmly chosen\r\nthis path must overcome many obstacles and difficulties\r\nresulting from the weakness of their socio-economic\r\nstructures and the international environment.\r\nFor my country, one of the most important difficulties\r\nis the armed rebellion in the north, which poses grave risks\r\nto its unity. This inherited situation is in large part caused\r\nby the drought in the Sahel, which is making living\r\nconditions precarious for its nomadic peoples, who already\r\nface a most hostile and arid environment. The situation is\r\na cause of great concern to Niger. Therefore, immediately\r\nit took office on 23 April 1993 the new Government\r\nknuckled down to finding ways and means to allow a fair\r\nand speedy solution to the problem to prevail in peace and\r\nbrotherly trust.\r\nThe Government has been helped in this undertaking by\r\nthe valuable assistance of friendly countries, to which I\r\nextend our sincere thanks and deep gratitude. Thanks to\r\nthese efforts, on 11 June 1993 the negotiations resulted in a\r\nthree-month truce which was scrupulously respected by the\r\nparties and whose terms were recently renewed. There are\r\nencouraging signs of a speedy solution to this problem being\r\nfound, and we intend to devote the needed energy to it.\r\nFrom this rostrum dedicated to peace I express the hope\r\nthat all the sons of the Niger nation will work together to\r\nsurmount their present difficulties and build a fraternal,\r\ndemocratic and prosperous Niger.\r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights held at\r\nVienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 reaffirmed that the right to\r\ndevelopment is a basic human right. It affirmed that\r\ndemocracy, development and basic human rights are\r\ninterdependent, reinforcing each other, and it stressed the\r\noverriding need to support the process of democratization in\r\ndeveloping countries if we wish to ensure its success.\r\nNiger remains convinced that freedom and democracy\r\nneed water to grow, just as fish need water to swim, and that\r\nthey need to be buttressed by economic and social progress.\r\nSimilarly, we are convinced that international peace and\r\nsecurity cannot prevail in the world unless we take into\r\naccount the vast mass of mankind’s legitimate yearnings for\r\neconomic and social progress.\r\nThus, development is a major challenge for the\r\nfledgling democracies. They must give an urgent and\r\ncompelling reply to the question: how can we maintain and\r\ncultivate our faith? That is the ardent question of millions\r\nof men and women who went to the ballot box to vote and\r\nwho, after the euphoria of victory, find themselves\r\nconfronted with the harsh realities of their lives, the endless\r\nproblems of survival.\r\nI know that the Assembly has a broad awareness of the\r\ncountless difficulties that paralyse our peoples in their daily\r\nlives and impede their development.\r\nI know that the Assembly is fully informed about the\r\nunspeakable hardships our peoples have endured for decades\r\nand our thoughts about them. Indeed, for year after year and\r\nsession after session, we have been constantly seized of such\r\ngreat topics as the deterioration in terms of trade, the\r\nbuttressing of protectionism, the debt crisis, the continuing\r\ndeterioration of the environment, the growing shrinkage of\r\npublic development assistance, population growth, and\r\nreforms in structural adjustment.\r\nThe listing of those great topics is but an imperfect\r\nsummary of the fate and the enormous poverty that is the lot\r\nof a large portion of mankind.\r\nThe economic situation of the African continent\r\nprovides an edifying example of that state of affairs. Africa\r\nhas been experiencing a widespread economic crisis of\r\nunprecedented severity, the result of a long period of\r\neconomic recession. For years now, the continent has\r\nsuffered from this prolonged recession and from a decline in\r\nliving standards and a breakdown in the social fabric that is\r\nso widespread and so deep that many of the benefits gained\r\nin the early years of independence have now been\r\nirretrievably lost. Today, real per capita income has sunk\r\nbelow the 1980 level.\r\nThe relationship between investment and gross national\r\nproduct continues to deteriorate. Our economies are marked\r\nby budgetary and trade imbalances and large import\r\nreductions, aggravated by the drop in the price of raw\r\nmaterials.\r\nAccording to some estimates, the ability of some\r\ncountries to repay, based on exports, is diminishing. Thus,\r\nthe debt-export relationship, which stood at 97 per cent in\r\n1980, fell to 233 per cent in 1985 and stood at\r\napproximately 333 per cent in 1992.\r\nIn any event, economic indicators give only an\r\nincomplete picture of the situation and do not enable us to\r\nvisualize the consequences of drought, famine and the\r\ndeterioration of the environment. The slump means that in\r\nsome regions of Africa the standards of living, which had\r\nalready been among the world’s harshest, have deteriorated\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\neven further, reaching levels that are unacceptable for a\r\nmodern civilization.\r\nYet the Governments of those countries have\r\nrecognized their own weaknesses and laid out areas of\r\nresponsibility. They have courageously undertaken harsh\r\nreforms and adopted painful austerity measures for their\r\npeople aimed at improving their economic and financial\r\nenvironment.\r\nFor a number of reasons, these adjustment policies have\r\nnot produced the expected results. I should point to two of\r\nthem.\r\nFirst, there is the inadequacy of financial and material\r\nmeans, which has prevented us from achieving results and\r\nconsolidating our gains.\r\nSecondly, there is our States’ burden of foreign\r\nindebtedness, which has reached an intolerable level and\r\nwhich continues to weigh ever more heavily upon them,\r\nworsening their economic and social difficulties.\r\nIn those circumstances, how can we expect the poor\r\ncountries to develop?\r\nUnderdevelopment is making daily headway, and the\r\nlist of countries eligible for the soft conditions of the\r\nInternational Development Association is growing.\r\nFor that reason, from this rostrum Niger is calling upon\r\nthe developed countries to give proof of greater solidarity by\r\nagreeing to a blanket cancellation of the debt of the least-\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nNiger had hoped to hear of this decision following the\r\nmeeting of the Group of 7, but, unfortunately, the seven\r\nmost-industrialized countries did not move to improve the\r\nrepayment abilities of the debtor countries.\r\nHence, we must curb this development, which has a\r\nnegative impact on our countries. We must find ways and\r\nmeans to reverse present trends. We must act in order to\r\nrestore hope to Africa, Asia and Latin America.\r\nNiger earnestly hopes that the first Copenhagen summit\r\non social development will not be another meeting with no\r\nfollow-up.\r\nSimilarly, the international conference on population\r\nand development planned for 1994 should provide an\r\nopportunity for rich and poor to join efforts against hunger\r\nand malnutrition.\r\nCloser to home, in a few days an international\r\nconference on African development will be held on the\r\ninitiative of the Government of Japan. Niger hopes that that\r\nmeeting will come up with the necessary radical measures to\r\nsolve the problems of the African continent.\r\nThe world is now enjoying one of those propitious\r\nmoments for peace that history occasionally provides us.\r\nProspects today enable us to hope for a better future.\r\nThe end of East-West antagonism has given rise to a\r\npowerful movement towards peace and has simultaneously\r\nawakened great hopes for sustainable development.\r\nDisarmament, as set forth in the United Nations\r\nCharter, must entail a system of collective security designed\r\nto avoid any excessive stockpiling of weapons. Indeed, it is\r\nof primary importance to establish confidence between\r\nneighbouring countries that share a similar destiny owing to\r\nthe many ties joining their respective populations. It is also\r\nessential that States without weapons of mass destruction\r\nhave guarantees that their territories will never serve as\r\ntesting grounds. We believe it is essential that the resources\r\nthus freed be devoted to eradicating poverty, which still, at\r\nthe end of the twentieth century, is creating conditions of\r\nshocking poverty intolerable to the human conscience.\r\nAnother ground for hope is the recent United Nations\r\nConference on Human Rights, which has declared the right\r\nto development to be a universal and inalienable right, an\r\nintegral part of fundamental human rights.\r\nHope was also created by the last Rio summit meeting,\r\nwhich focussed world attention on the threats to our\r\nenvironment, highlighted the existing interrelationship of\r\ndevelopment and the environment and thereby stressed the\r\noverriding need to ensure its preservation in the interests of\r\npresent and future generations.\r\nPledges to finance the programmes of Agenda 21 have\r\nalready been recorded. Niger hopes that the fine hopes\r\nawakened in Rio will very soon be translated into concrete\r\nactions. That is why we welcome the creation of operational\r\nmachinery such as the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and the intergovernmental committee to draft\r\nan international convention on desertification and drought.\r\nNiger, which has had to deal with the galloping and\r\nfrightening encroachment of the desert, is following with\r\nclose interest the work of this committee.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 9\r\nI have spoken at length about Niger and about our\r\nconcerns and our hopes. However, I should not like to give\r\nthe impression that the great problems of the world are\r\nmatters of indifference to us. Notwithstanding the difficult\r\ntimes through which we are passing, Niger is attentive to\r\nwhat is going on in the rest of the world. We are\r\nencouraged by developments in the situation in South Africa,\r\nand we were relieved to hear the announcement that the first\r\nfree, democratic elections there would be held on 27 April\r\n1994. In this regard, we join in the appeal of our brother\r\nNelson Mandela that the international sanctions imposed on\r\nSouth Africa be lifted. We believe that the adoption of such\r\na measure would help to create in that country the\r\natmosphere of détente and trust that is necessary if the\r\nemergence of a multiracial, egalitarian and democratic\r\nsociety is to be promoted. This would lead to South\r\nAfrica’s entry into the African arena and its return to the\r\nconcert of the civilized nations of the world.\r\nIt was with real relief that we received the results of the\r\nGeneva negotiations between the various parties to the\r\nconflict in Liberia, which led to the signing of the Cotonou\r\nagreements in Benin. This outcome suggests that peace is\r\nbeginning to return to that country. Niger supports action by\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States with a\r\nview to securing respect for these agreements by all the\r\nparties concerned.\r\nWe also welcome the talks in El Ayoun on Western\r\nSahara. These talks open up new prospects for a final\r\nsettlement of this conflict, which has lasted far too long.\r\nNow more than ever before, other regions of the\r\nAfrican continent require our close attention and action.\r\nThis is true of Angola, Mozambique and Somalia.\r\nRepresentatives may rest assured that Niger unreservedly\r\nsupports all Security Council resolutions that promote the\r\nreturn of peace to this long-suffering country.\r\nI wish now to praise Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali’s\r\ndynamic work towards elimination of the numerous sources\r\nof tension and conflict in Africa and in the world at large.\r\nWe wish to thank him, in particular, for the insights and\r\nthoughts contained in the report entitled \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\". We have familiarized ourselves with the many wise\r\nproposals that the Secretary-General has put forward in that\r\ndocument. In particular, we share his views regarding\r\npreventive diplomacy. It was in this spirit that the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, at its 29th summit meeting in\r\nCairo, equipped itself with machinery for the prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts in Africa.\r\nAway from the African continent, we welcome the\r\nsigning by the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel,\r\non 13 September 1993 in Washington, of the agreements on\r\nmutual recognition and on autonomy for the Gaza Strip and\r\nJericho.\r\nWe hope that the momentum for peace that is\r\nbeginning in certain parts of the world will move to Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, which has suffered far too long.\r\nIt is on this hopeful note that I shall conclude my\r\nstatement. But first I should like, on behalf of Niger, to\r\nwelcome the arrival in the great family of nations of Eritrea,\r\nthe Principality of Monaco, the Principality of Andorra, the\r\nCzech Republic, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia and the Slovak Republic. Their presence among\r\nus strengthens the universality of the United Nations and\r\ntestifies to the value of the Organization’s action in support\r\nof the widespread progress of mankind.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Niger for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Mahamane Ousmane, President of the Republic\r\nof Niger, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. CLAES (Belgium) (interpretation from French):\r\nI have the honour of speaking on behalf of the European\r\nCommunity and its member States.\r\nAllow me, first of all, Mr. President, to pay a tribute to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who conducted the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s proceedings during its forty-seventh\r\nsession.\r\nThe Assembly has unanimously decided to entrust to\r\nyou, Sir, the conduct of this the forty-eighth session. We\r\nwelcome that decision as we are familiar with your personal\r\nqualities and your professional experience. We also see this\r\nas a well-earned tribute to your country, the Republic of\r\nGuyana, and to the contribution made by the Caribbean\r\nregion to the activities of our Organization. The European\r\nCommunity and its member States, which continue to enjoy\r\nfruitful relations with the countries of the Caribbean, within\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe dynamic framework of the Lomé Convention, assure you\r\nof their fullest cooperation.\r\nWe welcome also the admission to our Organization of\r\nthe Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Eritrea, the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia and the Principality of Andorra.\r\nIn his address to the Assembly last year, my British\r\ncolleague, Mr. Douglas Hurd, made the point that, after a\r\nbrief interlude of optimism, the world had entered a period\r\nof instability and of challenges to law and order. This trend\r\nhas increased over the past 12 months. We now have to\r\ncope with new crisis situations, while - speaking only about\r\nEurope - a just and lasting solution to such a long-standing\r\nproblem as that of Cyprus has yet to be found, despite the\r\ncontinued efforts of our Organization.\r\nLong restrained by the so-called balance of terror, latent\r\nantagonisms have resurfaced in the Balkans, the Caucasus\r\nand Central Asia. The collapse of the old institutional\r\nframeworks has led to the emergence of forms of rapidly\r\ncompeting nationalisms. The personal ambitions of certain\r\nrulers and the propaganda machines they control have\r\nplunged clans or whole peoples into conflicts marked by the\r\nblind use of violence. In that process, the basic rights of the\r\nindividual and the elementary rules of international\r\nhumanitarian law have been constantly flouted.\r\nIn other countries, the economic and social crisis has\r\ncontinued to provide fertile ground for religious\r\nfundamentalism, enabling it to increase the number both of\r\nits followers and of its victims. Elsewhere, the existence of\r\na large immigrant population has served as a pretext for\r\nreactions of racial intolerance, which have even led to\r\ndeliberate criminal acts. All these forms of fanaticism\r\ndesignate human beings as the enemy to be destroyed. They\r\nmust be fought not only through political declarations and\r\nlaws but also through a more sincere and committed\r\nengagement in favour of the human values which should\r\nunite us all across continents and cultures.\r\nThe proliferation of these situations has gone hand in\r\nhand with a growing desire to possess weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. In this connection, we are concerned by the\r\nactions of Member States of our Organization which have\r\nample resources, bear regional responsibilities and claim to\r\nbe lovers of peace. The proliferation of these weapons\r\nrepresents a grave threat to both global and regional security\r\nand stability. It is of the utmost importance that the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty should be unconditionally extended in\r\n1995 for an indefinite period.\r\nEconomic underdevelopment and the unacceptable\r\nliving conditions of hundreds of millions of inhabitants of\r\nthe planet constitute another major concern for the European\r\nCommunity and its member States.\r\nThe outcome of three decades of development\r\ncooperation cannot be regarded as positive. This means that\r\nall of us, countries of the South and of the North, must take\r\nserious stock of the situation. We know that it is pointless\r\nto speak of peace in the world if we do not at the same time\r\nwork towards global economic and social development. The\r\nforthcoming world conferences in Cairo, Copenhagen and\r\nBeijing will be important landmarks in this process.\r\nOur concerns have not blinded us to the important\r\nefforts undertaken in all regions of the world towards\r\ndemocratization and economic recovery.\r\nThe Republics which made up the former Soviet Union\r\nhave pursued the immense task of creating a political,\r\neconomic and social framework designed to strengthen their\r\nsense of identity as individual nations. We must help these\r\ncountries find ways of achieving deep-rooted national\r\nreconciliation while fully respecting each other’s territorial\r\nintegrity. The European Community and its member States\r\nwill continue to support them substantially through technical\r\nassistance and partnership agreements. They will also\r\nmaintain their trade with the countries of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope, in particular through new or strengthened association\r\nagreements.\r\nThe European Community and its member States\r\nsupport President Yeltsin in his efforts to promote economic\r\nand political reform as well as to strengthen democracy in\r\nhis country.\r\nIt is in Africa that the gap between objectives and\r\nrealities remains most discouraging. Two hundred million\r\npeople across that continent live in abject poverty. However,\r\nin spite of armed conflicts and acute economic problems,\r\nthere are undeniable signs of the dawn of a new political era.\r\nIt is of course up to the African people to determine the\r\npace and practical form of their democratic development.\r\nSome dictators, however, are still clinging to the power they\r\nhave long exercised for their own exclusive benefit. Their\r\narmies, for whose services they somehow manage to pay, are\r\nlike a weapon permanently aimed at their own people.\r\nDespite appearances, they are now no more than an\r\nanachronistic element of underdevelopment.\r\nSouth Africa is approaching the historic moment when\r\nthe democratic majority of its people will accede to power.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 11\r\nThe path leading to this has, alas, been littered with further\r\nmassacres and attacks. The European Community and its\r\nmember States reiterate their support for the negotiating\r\nprocess pursued by President Frederik De Klerk and Mr.\r\nNelson Mandela and appeal to the international community\r\nto assist South Africa in this crucial phase by helping to\r\norganize elections and to rebuild and develop the country.\r\nIn Asia, the positive trend of the past few years has\r\nbeen maintained. On the economic front, the Asian\r\ncountries of the Pacific Rim, particularly China, are\r\ncharacterized by remarkable dynamism. The European\r\nCommunity and its member States hope that this progress\r\nwill swiftly bear positive results for the living and working\r\nconditions of their populations.\r\nLatin America is a continent at peace, continuing its\r\neconomic recovery in accordance with the objectives of\r\ndemocratically elected Governments. In several of these\r\ncountries, rapid population growth, social imbalances and\r\ndrug-trafficking are, however, still a considerable handicap\r\nin the march towards progress.\r\nMore attention has been paid by the authorities to the\r\nindigenous peoples, but certain tragic events have occurred\r\nto remind us of the precarious conditions in which those\r\npeoples live.\r\nThe European Community and its member States\r\nwelcome the substantially improved prospects for peace and\r\nstability in the Middle East. They hope that following the\r\nrecent Israeli-Palestinian agreements new decisive steps will\r\nbe taken by Israel and the Arab countries directly concerned\r\nin the Middle East peace process. The recent\r\nIsraeli-Jordanian declaration of principles is a positive move\r\nin this direction. We call upon this Assembly to take\r\naccount of these major developments when considering the\r\nsituation in the Middle East.\r\nThe European Community and its member States, in\r\nkeeping with their long-standing position, stand ready to\r\nassume, in close coordination with the competent\r\ninternational institutions, an important part in the general\r\ncoordination of the assistance offered by the international\r\ncommunity to the Palestinian people in the occupied\r\nterritories. In this connection donor countries will, above all,\r\nhave to be guided by criteria of efficiency and speed.\r\nDuring this difficult period the United Nations has not\r\nbeen merely a passive onlooker.\r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights made it\r\npossible to adopt a Final Declaration which reaffirms and\r\nenriches the universal consensus on the essential respect due\r\nin all circumstances to the human person. The Vienna\r\nProgramme of Action provides for a large number of\r\nmeasures to ensure greater respect for, and promotion of,\r\nsuch rights throughout the world. The European Community\r\nand its member States will endeavour, from the present\r\nsession, to achieve application of these measures, in\r\nparticular as regards increased resources for the Centre for\r\nHuman Rights and the appointment of a United Nations high\r\ncommissioner for human rights.\r\nActive preparations have continued for other world\r\nconferences, on population, social development and the\r\npromotion of women. The follow-up to Rio was ensured by\r\nthe first meeting of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, which, from the outset, established a relation\r\nof partnership, which we consider to be highly promising.\r\nThe \"Agenda for Peace\" has been discussed in various\r\nbodies. The warm welcome it has received has been\r\nfollowed by various practical measures of implementation.\r\nWe would, however, like our Assembly to show more\r\nwillingness to abandon its reservations regarding certain\r\ntypes of preventive action which have already been adopted\r\nin practice by the Security Council and the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe Organization itself has embarked on and made\r\nprogress with a series of restructuring measures. The most\r\ncomplex is probably the restructuring of the Security\r\nCouncil, but it is encouraging that this topic is now the\r\nsubject of open dialogue.\r\nPending a reform which would not compromise its\r\nefficiency, the Council has kept up the pace of its activities.\r\nIt has given a larger place in practice to the concepts of\r\npreventive diplomacy and cooperation with regional\r\norganizations. The Secretary-General has resolutely backed\r\nthis trend both through his numerous visits on the ground or\r\nthose of his personal representatives and through the\r\nadjustments he has made within the Secretariat. These have\r\nfocused particularly on strengthening the departments\r\nresponsible for managing peace-keeping operations. The\r\nindispensable extension of these services has not yet been\r\ncompleted and will require further assistance from the\r\nMember States. Indeed, there has been an overwhelming\r\nincrease in the United Nations operations in this area over\r\nthe last few years. They have not simply multiplied: their\r\nobjectives have also diversified. In several cases, the\r\ntraditional task of peace-keeping has had to be supplemented\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nor, initially, replaced by the much more delicate task of\r\nrestoring peace.\r\nThe Organization has, in the eyes of some, met with\r\nfailure in the very difficult situations with which it has had\r\nto cope in the former Yugoslavia and Somalia. The\r\nduplicity of some warlords constitutes a permanent threat of\r\ndestabilization.\r\nBut, in no circumstances has the international\r\ncommunity chosen to combine humanitarian-aid missions\r\nwith peace-restoring missions. The use of force has been\r\nseen only as a last resort in order to come to the help of\r\npeople held hostage by self-proclaimed leaders. Our\r\nOrganization has consequently been constrained to use,\r\nunder certain circumstances, means corresponding to the\r\nprovocations it has had to face. We must, however, draw\r\nlessons from the experience acquired through these various\r\noperations.\r\nThe breadth and complexity of humanitarian crises\r\nthroughout the world also require greater coordination of\r\nhumanitarian assistance both during strategic planning of\r\noperations and during their implementation on the ground.\r\nThe spirit of perseverance, in compliance with the\r\nCharter and human rights, is more necessary than ever. It\r\nenabled Cambodia to implement the Paris Agreements in\r\nconditions which proved to be very difficult - as indeed they\r\nhad promised to be. This represents a great victory for the\r\nCambodian people as well as a remarkable success for the\r\nUnited Nations, and was achieved through unprecedented\r\neffort: by numerous Governments, by thousands of officials\r\nand volunteers, and also by large numbers of soldiers,\r\ndozens of whom sacrificed their lives. The European\r\nCommunity and its member States pay tribute to the \"Blue\r\nHelmets\" who, frequently killed in cold blood, have been\r\nvictims of their duty throughout the world. Their safety, as\r\nwell as that of all United Nations staff, must be improved\r\nand the pursuit of their aggressors must be organized more\r\neffectively.\r\nThe European Community and its member States are\r\nalso convinced of the need to react to the consequences of\r\nthe presence of mines resulting from armed conflicts. These\r\ndevices claim numerous victims every year amongst the\r\ncivilian population and jeopardize the rehabilitation of vast\r\nareas of territory ravaged by war. We ask this Assembly to\r\nconsider the draft resolution which we have submitted on\r\nthis subject with a view to a more systematic and effective\r\norganization of assistance in mine-clearing. We also\r\nwelcome the French initiative of asking the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General to convene a conference to review the\r\n1981 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use\r\nof Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed\r\nto Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate\r\nEffects.\r\nThus, the overall picture of activities by the United\r\nNations and its Members during the last 12 months is far\r\nfrom disappointing, and I could have listed many other\r\npositive developments. However, when we consider the\r\ndifficulties facing us, it is hard to claim categorically that,\r\nwhatever happens, the United Nations will be able to meet\r\nthe challenges of the future effectively.\r\nThe Secretariat’s capacities are being used to the full;\r\nthey are no longer sufficient to deal with Member States’\r\nwishes in every case. The Organization’s coffers are empty\r\nor virtually so. The development of new activities is\r\nhampered more and more often by disagreements about the\r\nallocation of costs. Most of the major contributors, who are\r\nseriously affected in their own countries by an unfavourable\r\neconomic situation, regard strict budgetary restraint as more\r\nimportant than ever. The cost of peace-keeping operations\r\nalone will be $3.6 billion for 1993.\r\nIn addition to the immediate cash-flow problems, there\r\nis an increasing structural deficit in the balance between the\r\nability to take multilateral action and ever-increasing requests\r\nfor intervention. What can we do to ensure that the United\r\nNations does not fall victim to its own success? We feel\r\nthat finding a solution entails three areas of action.\r\nFirst, of course, all Member States must pay their\r\ncontributions fully and in a timely manner. That is a\r\nfundamental obligation with which the European Community\r\nand its member States never fail to comply. The effort this\r\nrequires is neither more nor less than that demanded of other\r\ncontributors, be they \"big\" or \"small\", for each Member\r\nState is required to make a contribution in line with its\r\nability to pay. Failure to pay represents a serious breach of\r\nthe commitments entered into, and it is all the more\r\nregrettable that certain defaulting countries at the same time\r\nlay claim to a privileged role in the Organization’s debates\r\nand decisions.\r\nSecondly, the various reforms undertaken in order to\r\nimprove the operational efficiency of the Organization have\r\nto be pursued with a maximum of determination. We have\r\nin mind in particular the management of the Secretariat, the\r\ncontrol of its expenditures and the forthcoming restructuring\r\nin the economic and social sector. It is unacceptable that the\r\nobjectives set could not be met owing to interminable\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 13\r\nnegotiations or power struggles between senior\r\nadministrators.\r\nThirdly, although the United Nations remains an\r\nintergovernmental body, it is called upon more and more\r\nfrequently to fulfil a central government task, with\r\nresponsibility for solving each and every problem that may\r\narise.\r\nIn order to cope with this growing tide of demands, the\r\nSecretary-General in his \"Agenda for Peace\" has quite\r\nrightly stressed the need for cooperation with regional\r\norganizations and arrangements.\r\nBut are they ready? Do they exist everywhere? Does\r\nthe strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations offer real prospects if the latter do\r\nnot become effective centres of decision and action? We\r\nfeel that, without the capacity for swift and ongoing\r\nintervention on a regional scale, preventive diplomacy by our\r\nOrganization is a resource which is undoubtedly\r\nindispensable but of limited scope. It will indeed facilitate\r\nsuccesses here and there, but will be insufficient to come to\r\ngrips with the most deep-rooted and most threatening\r\nantagonisms. If nothing changes, the danger of entire\r\ncountries imploding is real. The situation will channel\r\nmultilateral resources more and more into makeshift rescue\r\nand rehabilitation operations, to the detriment of collective\r\nsustainable development objectives.\r\nIn this connection the positive effects of an area of\r\nstability such as the European Community no longer need to\r\nbe demonstrated. The European Community was inspired at\r\nthe start by a profound desire for peacemaking and\r\nreconstruction. The same needs and aspirations are to be\r\nfound elsewhere in the world but have not been matched by\r\na comparable response.\r\nWe believe that there is no alternative to the\r\nestablishment of such areas in every continent. The resolute\r\npursuit of regional economic integration is a decisive and\r\nindispensable step in that direction. The benefits of\r\neconomies of scale and the free movement of persons and\r\ngoods then contribute as much to consolidating peace as to\r\nsharing prosperity. By uniting to form centres of stability\r\nand progress, the participating countries gradually free\r\nthemselves of the mounting problems and crises which, at\r\nthis time of tremendous change, tend to be more than they\r\ncan cope with on their own.\r\nIn addition to these areas of stability, it is also\r\nnecessary to create or strengthen broader regional\r\nmechanisms, making it possible for a number of subregions\r\nto develop principles of peaceful and prosperous coexistence.\r\nHere, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\ncan serve, if not as a universal model, at least as a source of\r\ninspiration. Even if its ability to intervene directly is\r\nlimited, it constitutes an indispensable platform for dialogue.\r\nWhen internal or bilateral crises occur, it encourages the\r\nneighbouring countries to show moderation and thus\r\ncontributes to limiting the conflict. As respect for common\r\nrules grows, more concrete collective actions can be\r\nenvisaged.\r\nThese are the essential tools for achieving the threefold\r\nobjective which the Secretary-General recommends in his\r\nlatest report on the activities of the Organization: peace,\r\ndevelopment and democracy.\r\nAlready 32 years ago, a young Egyptian jurist declared\r\nat the Academy of International Law:\r\n\"To encourage assemblies of States in a world that\r\nis becoming more and more Balkanized, to play\r\nthe role of bringing peoples together and to offer\r\nmassive and constant aid to underdeveloped\r\ncountries: these should be the primary objectives\r\nof the international organization.\" (Recueil des\r\ncours, Académie de Droit International, La Haye,\r\n1960, II, pp. 69-70)\r\nThis jurist is today at the head of our Organization.\r\nTo be sure, in all continents regional bodies have\r\nalready embarked on this course of action: in the past year\r\nthey have contributed, in cooperation with the United\r\nNations, to crucial mediation and peace-keeping ventures -\r\nbut always after the conflict had flared up. Areas of genuine\r\nstability and more reliable regional mechanisms would make\r\nit possible to forestall major crises by reducing their causes.\r\nRegional integration indeed can only help contain the\r\ncollective frustrations and anxieties that fuel nationalist\r\nmovements. It also provides a formidable incentive for\r\neconomic growth and therefore a strategic element in\r\ncombating poverty. Finally, regional economic integration,\r\nas it is progressively being built, simply eliminates the\r\noption of war from the thinking of the Governments and\r\npeoples involved.\r\nThe disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and its\r\ntragic consequences make it all too clear that the comments\r\nwe have just made relate to a course of action that will\r\nprove long and demanding rather than a miracle cure.\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nNeither the European Community nor the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe has been able to prevent\r\nthe outbreak of the conflict and the subsequent series of\r\ndisasters. Like the United Nations and the United States of\r\nAmerica, the European Community and its member States\r\nhave consequently been accused of lacking strategy and of\r\nindifference. For the European Community and its\r\nmembers, one of the lessons to be learned from this\r\ncatastrophe is that the deepening of its own internal relations\r\n- more Europe rather than less Europe - would strengthen\r\nthe role it must play as an instrument for promoting stability\r\nand peace in Europe and neighbouring areas.\r\nNo one can dispute, however, the fact that the European\r\nCommunity and its member States have endeavoured to\r\nmediate from the earliest days of the conflict. It was the\r\nmembers of the European Community who, going against\r\nthe current, managed to persuade the whole Security Council\r\nto react to the worsening situation. Without compromising\r\ntheir positions of principle, and despite numerous\r\ndisappointments, the member States of the Community have\r\nat no point wearied of their thankless task.\r\nThe efforts deployed at the London and Geneva\r\nConferences bear witness to this. As you are aware, the\r\nEuropean Community and its member States have played a\r\nfundamental role on the ground, particularly through the\r\nactivities of their monitors, in the implementation of\r\nsanctions and through their contribution to the United\r\nNations Protection Force and to measures to help the victims\r\nof the civil war.\r\nThe European Community and its member States also\r\nreiterate their readiness to participate in the implementation\r\nof a peace plan accepted by all the parties.\r\nThe Treaty of Maastricht on the European Union should\r\nprovide us with the means of strengthening the Union’s\r\nability to act in the world, in particular by implementing the\r\ncommon foreign and security policy. Once it has entered\r\ninto force - which should happen in the next few days - that\r\nTreaty will enable the European Union to play an enhanced\r\nrole in all areas of international policy and security and will\r\nestablish close working relations between the European\r\nUnion and the Western European Union. Moreover, the\r\nimminent enlargement of the European Union to include new\r\nmembers will simply increase its ability to exercise a\r\nstabilizing influence over adjacent countries.\r\nThe enlargement of the European Union and its\r\nreadiness to conclude association and cooperation agreements\r\nof ever wider scope with virtually all regions and countries\r\nof the globe are proof of our sincere desire to forge ahead\r\nwith the building of Europe while at the same time opening\r\nEurope to the world. This is the kind of Europe that is\r\nproving increasingly able to serve the objectives of the\r\nCharter. It provides encouragement to other countries and\r\nregions to unite, to join together, as Europe has done, in the\r\ncommon task of achieving greater peace in tomorrow’s\r\nworld.\r\nMr. KOZYREV (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): First of all, I should like to congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on your election to your important post. I see\r\nit as a manifestation of respect for the peace-loving policy\r\nof Guyana, and as a tribute to the growing role of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean countries in international affairs.\r\nLast year demonstrated the great potential for drama\r\ninherent in the post-confrontational and post-communist\r\nworld. We have seen that the very highest levels of\r\ncooperation are achievable. We see truly exciting prospects\r\nin yesterday’s address by President Bill Clinton of the\r\nUnited States and in other statements already delivered from\r\nthis rostrum.\r\nAt the same time, developments in the former\r\nYugoslavia, Abkhazia and Karabakh have also revealed the\r\ntrue depths of barbarism and the significant new threat of\r\naggressive nationalism.\r\nOutbursts of violence caused by xenophobia, even in\r\ntraditionally prosperous countries, have shown that no one is\r\nsafe from this danger. It is no less serious a threat to peace\r\ntoday than nuclear war was yesterday. The world\r\ncommunity mustered the strength to stave off the nuclear\r\ndanger. An important guarantee against this was the\r\nRussian-American START II Treaty. Nowadays we all\r\nconfront the equally formidable challenge of a new\r\ngeneration of conflicts and wars triggered by nationalist,\r\npolitical and religious intolerance. That is why democracy\r\nand peacemaking must be the key terms defining the strategy\r\nof the world community as it moves into the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe United Nations is now turning to face this new\r\nchallenge. The successful United Nations operation in\r\nCambodia was one of the largest in the history of the\r\nOrganization. Life is returning to normal in a country so\r\nlong torn by civil war. We stand ready, together with other\r\nmembers of the international community, to help the people\r\nof Cambodia to rebuild their country.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 15\r\nWe have seen a political and psychological\r\nbreakthrough in the solution of the key problem of the\r\nMiddle East settlement, which is the problem of Palestine.\r\nWe pay tribute to the courageous leaders of Israel and the\r\nPLO who have taken the first and most difficult step towards\r\nmutual recognition and reconciliation. We are ready to\r\nparticipate in an international conference on the economic\r\ndevelopment of self-governing Palestinian territories.\r\nRussia, as a co-sponsor of the Conference on the Middle\r\nEast, will spare no effort to advance the peace process in all\r\nother areas.\r\nHowever, the key to the settlement of many conflicts\r\nhas not yet been found. Russia will continue to encourage\r\nthe parties to the Bosnian conflict not to lose the chance of\r\na peaceful settlement and will contribute to the operation for\r\nits implementation under United Nations command.\r\nTwice during wartime I have had occasion to visit\r\nSarajevo. I propose that the United Nations should place the\r\ncity under its moral and political protection and that it\r\nshould be declared a centre of coexistence and a meeting\r\npoint for Islam, the Orthodox Church, Catholicism and other\r\nreligions. The city should become a symbol for the whole\r\nworld, a reminder that political violence and intolerance\r\nunder the banner of religion are the worst possible crimes\r\nagainst religion itself and the human spirit. In any case, it\r\nis surely time to think of establishing closer contacts\r\nbetween the United Nations and the world’s leading\r\nreligions.\r\nThe international community seems to have turned a\r\nblind eye to Afghanistan and Angola as soon as they ceased\r\nto be pawns in the cold war. The United Nations has no\r\nright to leave millions of people who live there in the grip\r\nof an epidemic of ethnic, clan and religious extremism and\r\nto forget their economic and humanitarian problems,\r\nincluding that of the liberation of former Soviet prisoners of\r\nwar.\r\nWe must learn the lessons of the United Nations\r\noperation in Somalia and considerably improve its\r\neffectiveness. Conscious of its special responsibility for\r\nmaintaining peace, Russia has made peacemaking and the\r\nprotection of human rights, particularly those of national\r\nminorities, the priority of its foreign policy, first and\r\nforemost in the territory of the former USSR.\r\nWe will spare no effort to strengthen the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States and make it a positive\r\nfactor, not only regionally, but globally. I call upon\r\nMembers of the United Nations to support proposals\r\nsubmitted jointly by the members of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States to the present session, relating in\r\nparticular to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, the struggle against international terrorism and\r\nthe protection of the environment.\r\nOur peacemaking efforts are already yielding their first\r\nresults. For more than a year now there have been no\r\nhostilities in the Transdniester region and South Ossetia.\r\nWith our participation, the process of normalization of the\r\nsituation and national dialogue has started in Tajikistan.\r\nRussia is making active efforts to put an end to the\r\nAbkhazian and Karabakh conflicts and to render\r\nhumanitarian assistance to their victims.\r\nAll these problems are too serious and too tragic for\r\nspeculation about neo-imperial plans of Russia, diplomatic\r\nrivalry, or the search for new spheres of influence by\r\nneighbouring and distant Powers. The United Nations, the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),\r\nand all States truly interested in peace, along with Russia,\r\nwill have enough work to do together. We want to see\r\nmuch more active assistance for our peacemaking efforts,\r\nnot in words, but in deeds.\r\nIn most cases this means that the United Nations should\r\ngive a mandate for operations conducted at the request of\r\nconflicting parties on the basis of appropriate agreements.\r\nFor this, close interaction with the United Nations and the\r\nCSCE missions is essential. Also, our minds should be open\r\nto non-traditional methods, such as the participation of\r\ncontingents of the conflicting parties themselves and those\r\nof a neighbouring mediating State. The pragmatic nature of\r\nsuch a model was shown in particular in the Transdniester\r\nregion and in South Ossetia. This model should be used,\r\nand not disregarded, in other regions, in the interests of the\r\nUnited Nations, which is facing an overload of peace-\r\nkeeping operations. The collective peacemaking forces of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States could also interact\r\nwith the United Nations itself. It is in any case time to\r\nestablish closer relations between the two organizations.\r\nIn material and financial terms the burden of\r\npeacemaking borne by Russia alone today in the territory of\r\nthe former USSR must be lightened. This could mean\r\nestablishing a voluntary fund for this purpose. Of course,\r\nRussia realizes that no international organization or group of\r\nStates can replace our peacemaking efforts in this specific\r\npost-Soviet area.\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nBy and large, taking into consideration the wide\r\nexperience gained throughout the world, it is time to think\r\nof a modern overall strategy of peacemaking which would\r\nbe integrated with \"An Agenda for Peace\" proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe Russian Federation, as an initiator of the statement\r\nof the President of the Security Council on peacemaking and\r\npeace-keeping issues, made on 28 May 1993, makes the\r\nfollowing proposals.\r\nThe first is to define a clear-cut concept of political\r\nleadership by the Security Council, create an effective\r\nmilitary command under the supervision of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and establish a procedure for involving, on that\r\nbasis, regional organizations.\r\nThe second is to establish under Article 29 of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter a special Security Council committee\r\non improving peace-keeping operation practices. This could\r\ninclude those States which have already gained considerable\r\nexperience in this area of United Nations activity.\r\nOur third proposal is to set up United Nations stand-by\r\nforces which would be at the disposal of Member States and\r\nused in peacemaking operations with the consent of their\r\nGovernments on a case-by-case basis at the request of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nAll these questions directly relate to the process of\r\nrenewal of the United Nations. The reform of United\r\nNations bodies, including the Security Council, will make\r\nsense and be effective if it allows for a more adequate\r\nresponse to new challenges in the field of peacemaking.\r\nThe settlement of conflicts should go hand in hand with\r\nthe international protection of their victims. As a follow-up\r\nto the Geneva International Conference on the Protection of\r\nVictims of War, we propose that international legal\r\nrestrictions be imposed on the use in internal conflicts of the\r\nmost destructive and indiscriminate types of weapons,\r\nprimarily military aircraft and artillery-rocket systems. We\r\nshould also eliminate or call a halt to the use of mercenaries\r\nand volunteers both in domestic and international conflicts.\r\nWe propose the establishment of a permanent\r\ninternational tribunal to deal with crimes against humanity.\r\nThe inevitability of punishment will help to prevent the\r\nrecurrence of such atrocities.\r\nIt has become crucially important to address\r\ncomprehensively the problem of refugees and to specify the\r\nrelevant principles of international law at a special\r\nconference.\r\nPeacemaking cannot be separated from the protection\r\nof human rights. The international community is duty-bound\r\nto condemn strongly \"double\" or lower standards of human\r\nrights protection, the theory and practice of the superiority\r\nof rights of an \"indigenous\" nation and the creation of mono-\r\nethnic States. The time has come to establish a United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Following\r\nthe example of the Conference on Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe, it is time for the United Nations also to have a\r\nSpecial Rapporteur on National Minorities. We support the\r\nproposals of the Secretary-General in the field of human\r\nrights protection.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction would\r\ndirectly contradict the peacemaking efforts of the United\r\nNations. This poses an ever growing threat not only in the\r\nfuture but even at the present. We are ready to cooperate\r\nwith the United States and other countries in solving the\r\nproblems connected with cutting off fissionable material\r\nproduction and banning the construction of facilities for such\r\nproduction, particularly in conflict areas.\r\nWe are in favour of transforming the Nuclear\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty into a universal agreement of\r\nunlimited duration. The United Nations should also work to\r\nensure the universality of and strict compliance with the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\r\nRussia reiterates, from this rostrum of the General\r\nAssembly, its intention to adhere to the international regime\r\nof non-proliferation of missile technology. In the very near\r\nfuture, we intend to take concrete steps to strengthen our\r\nrelevant domestic legislation, going so far as to envisage\r\ncriminal prosecution for violations of the rules governing the\r\nexport of missile equipment and technology. We call on all\r\nStates that possess such technology to join the Missile\r\nTechnology Control Regime (MTCR). It is also necessary\r\nto provide for equality of rights and obligations of the\r\nparticipants, so as to enable them freely to export peaceful\r\nspace technology.\r\nSuccessful economic reform is one of the guarantees of\r\npeace. This is of particular relevance to the many developing\r\ncountries and to the post-communist States. Easier access to\r\nworld markets for countries with transitional economies,\r\nincluding Russia, and the lifting of all discriminatory\r\nrestrictions is becoming an issue of the highest priority. We\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 17\r\nbelieve that the General Assembly should express its support\r\nfor efforts in this direction. We also propose the\r\nestablishment of a mechanism to coordinate programmes\r\ncarried out by the institutions of the United Nations system\r\nin support of economic reforms in countries in transition.\r\nThe strengthening of democracy is the principal\r\nguarantee of security and socio-economic development in the\r\nworld today. This has been true in Europe, Asia, Africa and\r\nLatin America, although the process is not proceeding easily\r\nand automatically everywhere. Peoples who have risen up\r\nagainst totalitarianism are threatened by the risk of political\r\nviolence and ultra-nationalism.\r\nWe categorically reject such an alternative. Russia is\r\npeacefully transforming itself in accordance with the\r\nfundamental principle of democracy: free elections. In 1991,\r\nthe people of Russia elected their country’s first democratic\r\nPresident, and they confirmed their confidence in his policies\r\nat the April referendum this year. On the basis of this\r\ntwofold mandate, the President has taken decisive measures\r\nto ensure democratic elections to the Parliament in\r\nDecember of this year. Thus, the old totalitarian system of\r\npower will be definitively dismantled and replaced by a new\r\nsystem of power elected by the people and responsible only\r\nto the people. We invite international observers to monitor\r\nthe elections to the Parliament.\r\nIn building a new democratic Russia, we of course must\r\nfirst of all rely on our own potential. Yet we very much\r\nappreciate the solidarity the democratic community has\r\nshown us. Such solidarity is neither an act of interference\r\nin our domestic affairs nor the whimsical gesture of\r\nromanticists in international politics. It is simply an\r\nexpression of the human duty to protect the rights of\r\nindividuals in other countries.\r\nNext month will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nMoscow Conference when, in the turbulent year of 1943, the\r\nfoundation was laid for the establishment of the United\r\nNations, which was conceived as an organization of\r\ndemocratic countries having triumphed over Nazi\r\ntotalitarianism. Half a century later, the success of\r\ndemocracy in Russia and many other countries has made it\r\npossible for the first time to realize fully the lofty destiny of\r\nthe United Nations and to help it become a truly efficient\r\npeacemaking Organization.\r\nWe should not allow political short-sightedness, current\r\neconomic difficulties, egoism and conceit to make us lose\r\nthe chance to transform the still fragile post-communist\r\nworld into a democratic one. I hope that this session will\r\nmove us closer to an understanding of this goal and of the\r\nways of reaching it in the interests of all States and nations.\r\nMr. HURD (United Kingdom): Mr. President, may I\r\nfirst of all congratulate you on your election, and on the\r\ndignified and effective way in which you are already\r\npresiding over this Assembly. You have a burdensome job\r\nand we wish you all good fortune as you discharge it.\r\nI have sometimes heard speakers from this rostrum\r\npatrol the world in their speeches in the general debate,\r\ndealing at length with one continent after another. Indeed,\r\nI have done so myself in past years. There is much to\r\ndescribe: events in the Middle East and South Africa are\r\nparticularly encouraging, and developments in Russia, as we\r\nhave just heard from Mr. Kozirev, are particularly important.\r\nBut today it seems to me that in the time available, the focus\r\nof interest should not only be on distant events or distant\r\ntragedies, but here, in this building, on this institution.\r\nNever has there been a time when the United Nations has\r\nbeen so discussed, so misunderstood, so needed.\r\nThe international task of this decade is managing\r\ndisorder. I believe it is possible. But it demands cool\r\nheads, low voices, and an understanding of what we can and\r\ncannot do. It demands concertation between all countries\r\nthat take on part of the responsibility for steering the world\r\nthrough channels which are certainly strewn with rocks.\r\nThis concertation takes place in many forums, but nowhere\r\nwith greater legal and political authority than here at the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe can now see the events of 1989 in their true\r\nperspective. They did not usher in a new world order. I\r\nthink we have to be sober about this. What happened in\r\n1989 was not the birth of a new world order, it was the\r\ncollapse of one super-Power and the end of communism as\r\na threat to world peace.\r\nThe tragedies of the world have continued. Indeed,\r\nthey have probably increased since 1989. \"Tragedy\" is a\r\nbetter description than the usual, and overworked, term\r\n\"crisis\", because \"crisis\" implies a threat to world peace.\r\nNow that the cold war is over and super-Powers no longer\r\nexert themselves on behalf of clients, it is no longer a crisis\r\nin that sense - a threat to world peace - if Sudan, Bosnia,\r\nAngola, Liberia, Georgia, Afghanistan, Rwanda, Somalia,\r\nTajikistan, Azerbaijan and others are racked by civil war.\r\nBut these are appalling tragedies for those who are killed or\r\ndriven from their homes, and indeed for all of us, because\r\nwe are all diminished when the bell tolls.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nSome of these tragedies are illuminated by the\r\nhaphazard light of television. In those cases, millions of our\r\ncitizens, in all our countries, share feelings of sympathy,\r\nindignation and horror. But other tragedies equally foul are\r\nplayed in a darkened theatre: no television, no audience,\r\nlittle pressure. But all these tragedies are a reproach to those\r\nof us who are convinced that it is possible slowly and\r\npainstakingly to construct a more decent world.\r\nHow do we do that? Not, it is clear, by the remaining\r\nsuper-Power using its superiority to impose its own solutions\r\nby force. In the 10 tragedies that I listed, the United States\r\nhas intervened with troops only in one, Somalia - and that\r\nnow on a reduced scale and under the United Nations -\r\nbecause the United States, quite rightly in my view, is not\r\nprepared to send its troops all over the world, as Rome once\r\nsent its legions all over Europe, to fight, to pacify and to\r\nrule. There are British, French, Spanish and other European\r\ntroops in Bosnia today under the command of the United\r\nNations. But their role is to save Bosnian lives - they do\r\nthat daily - implementing United Nations decisions.\r\nLikewise, they are not imposing a European imperium on\r\nthat country.\r\nIf America and its allies are not to exert themselves as\r\na joint imperial Power, imposing on other countries and\r\nsustaining laws and rulers of their choice, then the answer\r\ncan only lie in reforming and making much better use of the\r\ninternational institutions to which we belong. They were\r\nmostly built after the Second World War for one purpose\r\nand are now, after the end of the cold war, being hurriedly\r\nadapted for another. The British architect Norman Foster\r\nhas just been given the responsibility of designing in Berlin\r\nthe new parliament house for a united Germany. If his plans\r\nare accepted, he intends to include the old Reichstag\r\nbuilding alongside the line of the Berlin Wall in a splendid\r\nnew structure reaching across the old Wall into East Berlin.\r\nThere is a parable here for us as well as for Germany.\r\nInevitably, we have to cope as best we can with what\r\nwe have. A man, after all, may take some shelter in an\r\nunfinished building. I do not believe that an international\r\norganization like ours, which is not a colonizing Power, will\r\never be able to guarantee solutions to civil wars or even to\r\nthat pernicious variant of a civil war which we see today in\r\nBosnia. But if there are no guarantees of success, the\r\nUnited Nations can be helped greatly to improve on its\r\nrecord. With greater experience, greater resources for\r\npreventive action and effectively coordinated humanitarian\r\nefforts, it can act before the situation gets out of control and\r\nthe demand grows for the implementation of sanctions and\r\nfor peace enforcement.\r\nI hope that within the next few weeks the European\r\nCommunity will move into a new phase of working together\r\non a common foreign and security policy once the Treaty of\r\nMaastricht is ratified by all 12 member States. Our\r\nPresident, Willy Claes, the Foreign Minister and Deputy\r\nPrime Minister of Belgium, has just illustrated that point.\r\nBut one of our main aims as European partners must be to\r\nsupport and strengthen the role and the work of the United\r\nNations, for the United Nations is not \"them\"; it is us, all of\r\nus. We have to take responsibility for it and its failures.\r\nIf we want the United Nations to work better, it is up\r\nto us to give the Secretary-General the support he needs in\r\nthoughts, words, deeds and money. I suppose there are few\r\nmore lonely or more demanding jobs than that of the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, and the present\r\nSecretary-General certainly has the misfortune to hold his\r\noffice in interesting times. He has already given and\r\ncontinues to give a firm and effective lead. He needs and\r\ndeserves our support.\r\nThe United Nations is unique. It alone conveys the\r\nword of the international community. Only the United\r\nNations has the legal powers to translate those words into\r\naction for the maintenance of world peace. We need, as\r\nPresident Clinton said yesterday, to look at tasks closely, to\r\nensure that they are properly defined and that the resources\r\nare there to meet them. We may on occasion have to accept\r\nthat a mandate should not be given because in reality it\r\ncannot be fulfilled.\r\nLet me follow that by looking briefly at the way we\r\ncarry out peace-keeping operations, the way we deploy\r\npreventive diplomacy and the way we run our finances.\r\nPeace-keeping: United Nations blue-helmets are\r\ndeployed on nearly every continent. We can reel off the\r\nstatistics, but actually we hear too little of individual soldiers\r\nand small detachments. Who knows, for example, of the\r\nsingle military observer in a remote part of Cambodia who\r\nfound himself not only acting as the local arbiter of family\r\ndisputes but also providing a local, much appreciated,\r\nmedical service using a handbook called When There is No\r\nDoctor, who kept on securing supplies from his wife in\r\nGermany and the field hospital in Phnomh Penh for his\r\nKhmer community? Or the United Nations military observer\r\nwho spent his leave in Bangkok fund-raising for a water\r\nfilter for a remote Cambodian village? Now, they happen to\r\nbe British, but such servants of the world come from many\r\ncountries.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 19\r\nWe in Britain are committed to our peace-keeping\r\ncontribution. We now have over 3,300 men and women in\r\nblue berets around the world.\r\nIn June the Secretary-General asked Member States to\r\nidentify for him those areas of United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations which needed strengthening and for our ideas on\r\npositive steps we could take. I look forward to his report\r\ndrawing all those responses together.\r\nUseful steps have certainly been taken. There is now\r\na 24-hour operations room, improving the ability of those\r\nhere in New York to oversee operations around the world.\r\nThe standby force planning project has been started. A new\r\nDepartment of Peace-keeping Operations is responsible for\r\nall United Nations field missions. We can build on these\r\nimprovements.\r\nGood organization involves clarity and sobriety in\r\nsetting out our objectives. That means that any operation\r\nmust have clear and achievable objectives linked to a\r\npolitical process which offers reasonable hope of a solution,\r\nand to which all parties should be committed. The mandate\r\nshould be precise and finite. That means adequate support\r\nat Headquarters for planning and reconnaissance missions.\r\nIt means that the Security Council must resist the temptation\r\nto become involved in the detailed conduct of operations. It\r\nmeans the mandate must not create impossible obligations\r\nfor a force commander on the ground. Once an operation is\r\nagreed, command and control relationships could be more\r\nclearly defined.\r\nUnity of command at the highest level is essential.\r\nWhere the United Nations is charged with executing as well\r\nas authorizing a peace-keeping operation, all aspects of it\r\nshould be handled by a single department in New York.\r\nThat is why we have suggested the creation of an expanded\r\nplanning and operations staff. This in effect is a general\r\nstaff for peace-keeping. These men and women, civilian and\r\nmilitary, would be able together to provide the necessary\r\ncore of the United Nations strategic-planning chain. They\r\nwould operate mainly here in New York, but also in the\r\nfield. They would provide the United Nations with the\r\nnervous system for which its present staff is neither\r\nstructured nor resourced.\r\nWe are not proposing here some new and heavy\r\nbureaucracy. On the contrary, we are talking about core\r\nstaff: trained staff officers, United Nations civil affairs and,\r\nincreasingly, humanitarian advisers, and chief administrative\r\nofficers. The example of the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), of a special\r\nenvoy for all humanitarian and refugee aspects of an\r\noperation, is good.\r\nThen, there must be flexibility in running peace-keeping\r\noperations. The more comprehensive a bureaucracy\r\nbecomes, the harder it is for it to stay nimble on its feet.\r\nDoctrinal and administrative difficulties in working with\r\nother international organizations can be overcome. For\r\nexample, the United Nations is already building valuable\r\nlinks with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE) and with the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO). Many peace-keeping and\r\npeacemaking operations can be run more effectively by\r\nregional organizations or single countries on behalf of the\r\nUnited Nations. That depends on the nature of the problem\r\nand on the proposed action agreed by the United Nations.\r\nI am thinking, for example, of the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) in Liberia, the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) in Rwanda, and the European\r\nCommunity and NATO in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nRegional organizations can also be asked to help with\r\ntraining. We might look at getting certain nations with well-\r\ntrained, equipped and available forces to provide the first\r\nwave of a peace-keeping force, allowing other nations the\r\ntime to train and equip their forces to the required standard.\r\nA commitment to deploy early would of course need to be\r\nmatched by a United Nations commitment to agree a firm\r\nend-date for the deployment, because exits can be as\r\nimportant as entrances.\r\nWhat we cannot do, we should not pretend to do. If\r\nwe play a game of bluff, we can deceive and disappoint\r\nothers, and sometimes we deceive and disappoint ourselves.\r\nRarely can we attain our ends that way. It is empty to\r\npretend that we can impose peace with justice on every\r\ndisorder, every dispute, outside our national borders.\r\nBut what the United Nations can do, it should do well.\r\nCambodia, for example, is a success story. So was Namibia.\r\nOur peace-keepers have been able to limit, though not stop,\r\nconflict and to assuage, though not bring to and end,\r\nsuffering in Bosnia and Somalia. But the authority of the\r\nUnited Nations will suffer if it fails to approach new\r\nchallenges realistically and flexibly.\r\nHowever important peace-keeping may be, successful\r\npreventive diplomacy would be better. I have just been\r\nreading the book published this week by our Australian\r\ncolleague, the Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth\r\nEvans. His new book, Cooperating for Peace, brings this\r\npoint out well and is full of fruitful ideas. Defusing trouble\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncosts a great deal less than a military operation. You can\r\nfield plenty of emissaries for the price of a battalion. But to\r\nbe useful, of course, an emissary has to set about his work\r\nbefore the excitement of violence has taken hold.\r\nThe Secretary-General has been energetic here. He has\r\nsent missions to several areas of tension - to Tajikistan and\r\nother regions of the former Soviet Union, to Macedonia, to\r\nSouth Africa and elsewhere.\r\nBut in this as in other parts of the United Nations\r\nsystem money is tight. Many missions create an acute need\r\nfor additional international staff with the necessary skills. I\r\nam thinking not just of eminent people, of retired ministers\r\nor distinguished ambassadors who can head such missions.\r\nThe Secretary-General will find them when he needs them.\r\nWhat he needs from Member States is personnel at a more\r\njunior level with local experience and negotiating skills.\r\nNow, we have discussed this problem in particular with\r\nthe French Government, and as an Anglo-French initiative\r\nwe stand ready to provide the Secretariat with a list of such\r\npeople, people who have experience in Government service -\r\nsometimes outside Government service - and whom we\r\nwould be prepared to make available for particular missions.\r\nWe would also be prepared to provide a certain amount of\r\nequipment where personnel provided by the United Kingdom\r\nwere involved. We are ready to respond to the invitation of\r\nthe Secretary-General in \"Agenda for Peace\" to provide\r\ninformation crucial to the task of preventive diplomacy. The\r\nBritish and French Governments are both committed to\r\nsupport him in this way, and we hope that others may join\r\nin a similar enterprise.\r\nAll this work means a financial burden. Of course we\r\nshould all pay our assessed contribution in full and promptly.\r\nWe do so. So do most of our European partners, the Nordic\r\ncountries and those with a long tradition of peace-keeping\r\nlike Australia and Canada. But others, not entirely or\r\nalways through their own fault, others who share the heavy\r\nburden of international responsibility, do not.\r\nThe fact is, the United Nations will always be short\r\nof money. Even if everybody pays up in full and on time,\r\nthe United Nations will still have to choose priorities within\r\nthe resources available to it. That means - and will always\r\nmean - turning down some good causes, and reappraising\r\nand sometimes bringing to an end existing commitments.\r\nThe United Nations needs to conduct a rigorous\r\nscrutiny of what it needs and what it spends. Obviously, it\r\nwould be able to afford more operations if it ran the existing\r\nones more economically. Without thrift, without financial\r\nprobity, the authority of the United Nations will weaken and\r\nvanish. So we welcome the Secretary-General’s recent\r\nadditional senior appointments at the level of Assistant\r\nSecretary-General, covering administrative and financial\r\naffairs. We support proposals for a system of inspection\r\nwith teeth, which can match more delegated financial\r\nauthority to the field.\r\nI mention these three areas - peace-keeping, preventive\r\ndiplomacy and finance. If we can tackle these three areas\r\nconstructively and vigorously, there is no reason why even\r\nunder present strains the authority of the United Nations\r\nshould not grow as strikingly as the burden of expectations\r\nnow placed upon it. People will always continue to turn to\r\nthe United Nations, even if they will always expect more of\r\nus than is conceivable.\r\nWe are discussing, in that context, reform, and we in\r\nBritain welcome the debate on Security Council reform. We\r\nare discussing positively the enlargement of the Council.\r\nThis will be complex, as our debate already makes clear,\r\nbecause there are many currents and cross-currents of view.\r\nI do not doubt that if there were to be consensus on\r\nenlarging the Security Council there are some countries\r\nwhich, because of their global interests, their contribution to\r\ninternational security, their contribution to United Nations\r\npeace-keeping, could undertake the full range of\r\nresponsibilities of a permanent member and can certainly be\r\nexpected to do so.\r\nI have concentrated simply on this Organization for the\r\nreason which I gave. Few tasks are more important than\r\nimproving the way the United Nations works if we are to\r\nsecure a more stable world. We have lived through the\r\nevents of these last few years. They have been dramatic and\r\nexhilarating, they have changed the political and strategic\r\nlandscape, but they have not removed from us our\r\nresponsibility to work constructively for a better United\r\nNations. This better world order will not happen because we\r\nmake a few speeches or pass a few resolutions. It will be\r\nconstructed steadily, brick by brick, learning always the right\r\nlessons from the past, developing steadily our international\r\ninstitutions and our international relations.\r\nIt is fair to say that in the last four years, with its ups\r\nand downs, we have come a long way, and I believe that,\r\ntogether, we have the will and the wisdom to continue along\r\nthat road.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 21\r\nMr. PERES (Israel): I should like to congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on your unanimous election to preside over\r\nthe forty-eighth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe feel strongly that the time has come for all of us -\r\ncommunities, nations, peoples, families - finally to lay the\r\nlast collective wreath on the tombs of the fallen combatants\r\nand on the monuments of our beloved. It is the right way to\r\nhonour their memories and to answer the needs of the newly\r\nborn. We have to lay the foundations for a new Middle\r\nEast.\r\nThe peace agreement between us and the Palestinians\r\nis not just an accord signed by political leaders. It is an\r\nongoing, profound commitment to the next generation of\r\nArabs and Israelis, Christians, Muslims, Jews and people of\r\nall other faiths.\r\nWe know it is not enough to declare an end to war.\r\nWe have to try to eradicate the roots of all hostilities. If we\r\nonly bring violence down but ignore misery, we may\r\ndiscover that we have traded one menace for another peril.\r\nTerritorial disputes may have been the reason for wars\r\nbetween nations, and poverty may again become the seed of\r\nviolence between peoples. While signing the documents on\r\nthe lawn of the White House, I could almost sense the\r\nbreeze of a fresh spring, and my imagination began to\r\nwander to the skies of our land, which may have become\r\nbrighter to the eyes of all people, both those who agree and\r\nthose who oppose. On the lawn one could almost hear the\r\nheavy tread of boots leaving the stage after a hundred years\r\nof hostility. One could have heard the gentle tiptoeing of\r\nnew steps making a debut in a world awaiting peace.\r\nYet we could not depart from reality. I know that the\r\nsolution to the Palestinian issue may be the key to a new\r\nbeginning, but it is in no way the answer to the many needs\r\nawaiting us upon our return home.\r\nThe last decade saw great changes, including the end of\r\nEast-West confrontation and the opening of the way for the\r\ngradual disappearance of North-South polarization. The\r\ngreat continent of Asia and the picturesque continent of\r\nSouth America introduced the dynamics of an economic\r\ndevelopment of their own. The dramatic event in South\r\nAfrica is a declaration to the same effect. So, contrary to all\r\nassumptions, it has been demonstrated that neither geography\r\nnor race is a hindrance or an advantage to economic\r\npromise.\r\nWe witnessed the end of some wars only to discover\r\nthat the warriors did not reach their own promised land.\r\nSome colonized people gained their independence, but they\r\nhardly enjoyed its fruits. The dangers may have been over,\r\nbut their hopes evaporated. We have learned that the end of\r\na war should be the beginning of a new genesis, which will\r\nbe the end of belligerency and will put an end to\r\npsychological prejudices.\r\nNo nation, rich or poor, is able nowadays to attain\r\nsecurity unless the region in which it exists is secure. The\r\nscope of regional security must exceed the range of ballistic\r\nmissiles, which may hit each and all of us.\r\nAs we strive to achieve a comprehensive peace, no\r\nwound must remain unhealed.\r\nGeographically speaking, we live side by side with the\r\nJordanian Kingdom, and what is so obvious geographically\r\nmust become clear politically. We have already agreed with\r\nthe Hashemite Kingdom on many complicated issues, and\r\nthere is no doubt that we can complete the story fully, that\r\nwe can offer the people on both sides of the river full peace,\r\nthat the Dead Sea can become a spring of new life and that\r\nthe old waters of the River Jordan can be a source of\r\nprosperity flowing from each side to the other.\r\nWe hope - as a matter of fact, we are determined - to\r\nmake peace with Syria, yet we ask the Syrian leadership, if\r\nit has chosen peace, why it refuses to meet openly. If Syria\r\nis aiming for the Egyptian fruits of peace, it must follow the\r\nprocess that led to them. Both of us have to look ahead and\r\nrealize that the threats of war are no more than an illusion\r\nthat one can return to an unbearable past.\r\nWe shall not give up our negotiations with our\r\nLebanese neighbours. We do not have any territorial claims\r\nor any political pretensions concerning Lebanon. We pray,\r\ntogether with many Lebanese, that their country will no\r\nlonger be a back yard for troublemakers. It is for Lebanon\r\nto make a choice between Hizbollah, on the one hand, which\r\noperates from its territory and then takes orders from another\r\nGovernment, and, on the other, insisting on having one\r\narmy, one policy, and offering real tranquillity to its people\r\nand security to its neighbours. Lebanon does not need a\r\nlicense to regain its independence, and Lebanon should not\r\npostpone its return to its balanced, traditional policy.\r\nI am not sure whether there is a new order in the\r\nworld, but all of us feel there is a new world awaiting an\r\norder. We are encouraged by the new attempt of the United\r\nNations and its Secretary-General to answer the social and\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\neconomic call of the present era. The United Nations was\r\ncreated as a political answer; today it must face social and\r\neconomic questions.\r\nThe Middle East, which has been an important agenda\r\nitem in United Nations history, must become prosperous, not\r\nonly peaceful. To construct a modern Middle East we need\r\nwisdom no less than financial support.\r\nWe have to rid ourselves of the costly follies of the\r\npast and adopt the principles of modern economy. Who\r\nwill, and who should, pay the cost of oversized armies?\r\nWho will, and who should, bear the price of an arms race\r\nwhose cost has reached $50 billion annually? Who will, and\r\nwho should, pay for the inefficiencies of old systems? Who\r\nwill, and who should, compensate for outmoded censorship\r\nof mail and control of trade and travel? And who will\r\ncomply with the State where suspicion intercepts the\r\nenterprising spirit of the people?\r\nWe can, and we should, turn to the promises of\r\nscientific development, the market economy and\r\ncomprehensive education. We must base our industry,\r\nagriculture and services on the highest of today’s\r\ntechnologies. We have to invest in our schools. Israel, a\r\ncountry of immigration, is blessed with many scientists and\r\nengineers. We shall gladly make this human wealth\r\navailable as a contribution.\r\nI know that there is suspicion; that, when referring to\r\na common market in the Middle East or announcing an\r\nIsraeli contribution, it may be perceived as an attempt to win\r\npreference or to establish domination. May I say sincerely\r\nand loudly that we did not give up territorial control to\r\nengage ourselves in economic superiority. The age of\r\ndomination, political or economic, is dead. The time of\r\ncooperation has begun.\r\nAs a Jew, may I say that the virtue and the essence of\r\nour history since the times of Abraham and the\r\ncommandments of Moses have been an uncompromising\r\nopposition to any form of occupation, domination and\r\ndiscrimination. For us, Israel is not just a territorial\r\nhomeland, but a permanent moral commitment as well.\r\nThere are other questions, concerning the building of a\r\ncommon market in the Middle East, as to how to attain this\r\nwhen governments are so varied and economies are so\r\ndifferent. The differences in governments and economies\r\nshould not prevent us from doing together what can be done\r\ntogether: combating the desert and offering fertility to an\r\narid land.\r\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations declared that the Middle East must double its\r\nagricultural production in the 25 years to come. The\r\npopulation of the region in the same period will double itself\r\nanyway. The land is cut by many and large deserts and its\r\nwater resources are stingy and scarce. Yet we know that in\r\na similar period of time - the 25 years between 1950 and 1975 -\r\nIsrael was able to increase its agricultural output twelvefold -\r\nan increase unprecedented in history.\r\nDuring the past decade, 95 per cent of the growth of\r\nour agriculture resulted from research, planning, training and\r\norganizing. High technology permits nations to attain real\r\nindependence and to experience genuine freedom, political\r\nas well as economic. There is nothing new about the\r\nscarcity of water in our midst. Jacob and Esau drank from\r\nthe same wells even when their paths were separated. But\r\nthen, unlike today, they could not desalinate the sea water;\r\nthey could not computerize irrigation; nor could they enjoy\r\nthe potential of biotechnology.\r\nWe are meeting again with an entirely different\r\nopportunity. Greening the land can be accompanied by the\r\ncreation of many new jobs for all people in the area. The\r\nmost promising opportunity may be the development of\r\ntourism. No other branch of modern industry assures an\r\nimmediate growth of the Middle East like this one. Our area\r\nis blessed by nature and by history, a history which is still\r\nvery much alive: the eternity of Jerusalem, the magnificence\r\nof the pyramids, the symbols of Luxor, the Hanging Gardens\r\nof Babylon, the Pillars of Wisdom in Baalbek, the red\r\npalaces of Petra, the inimitable charm of Marakesh, the old\r\nwinds which still blow in Carthage, not forgetting the\r\nbeaches of Gaza or the scent of Jericho’s perfumed fruits.\r\nWe have to open roads to those wonders and keep them safe\r\nand hospitable. Tourism depends on tranquility; tourism\r\nenhances tranquillity. It makes friendship a vested interest.\r\nThirdly, we have to build an infrastructure with modern\r\nmeans so as to avoid the pitfalls of the past. Modern\r\ntransportation and revolutionary communications crossing the\r\nair, covering the ground and connecting the seas will turn\r\ngeographical proximities into an economic advantage. We\r\nshould not ask taxpayers of other countries to finance follies\r\nof our own. We have to correct them ourselves. We do not\r\nhave the moral right to ask for the financing of unnecessary\r\nwars or wasteful systems.\r\nIf the thumping of hammers replaces the thunder of\r\nguns, many nations will be more than willing to extend a\r\nhelping hand. They will invest in a better future. They will\r\nsupport the replacement of unwarranted confrontation with\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 23\r\nmuch-needed economic competition. Markets can serve the\r\nneeds of the people no less than flags can signify their\r\ndestinies. The time has come to build a Middle East for the\r\npeople and not just for the rulers.\r\nIt was not simple to open the locked doors to peace. In\r\nthe name of God, let them not be closed again. Let peace\r\nbe comprehensive, embracing all issues, all countries, all\r\ngenerations. We suggest that we all negotiate together as\r\nequals. We offer a common ground of mutual respect and\r\nmutual compromise. Thirteen years have passed since we\r\nmade peace with Egypt. We are grateful to Egypt and its\r\nPresident for expanding understanding, overt and hidden. In\r\na world in which so many insoluble problems reside, the\r\nPalestinians and we have finally shown that in fact there are\r\nno insoluble problems, only people who tend to believe that\r\nmany problems are insoluble.\r\nWe have negotiated one of the most complicated issues\r\nof the last 100 years. We are grateful to the United States\r\nfor its support and leadership. We are grateful to both\r\nPresident Clinton and Secretary Christopher for their crucial\r\nrole. We appreciate the Egyptian role and the Norwegian\r\nencouragement; the European involvement and serious\r\ncontribution; the Asian support and blessing. Maybe we\r\nnow have the right to say to other people in conflict: \"Do\r\nnot give up. Do not surrender to old obsessions and do not\r\ntake fresh disappointments at face value.\" What we did,\r\nothers can do as well.\r\nWe are determined to make the agreement with the\r\nPalestinians into a permanent success. Israel would consider\r\nthe economic success of the Palestinians as though it were\r\nits own, and I believe that a newly achieved security will\r\nserve the aspirations of the Israelis and the necessities of the\r\nPalestinians.\r\nGaza, after 7,000 years of suffering, can emancipate\r\nitself from want. Jericho, without its fallen walls, can see its\r\ngardens blossom again.\r\nAs the twentieth century comes to a close, we have\r\nlearned from the United States and Russia that there are no\r\nmilitary answers to the new military dangers, only political\r\nsolutions. Successful economies are no longer a monopoly\r\nof the rich and the mighty. They represent an open\r\ninvitation to every nation ready to adopt the combination of\r\nscience and open-mindedness. We see at the end of this\r\ncentury that politics can achieve more by good will than by\r\npower, and that the young generation watching their\r\ntelevisions compare their lot with the fortunes or misfortunes\r\nof others. They see freedom, they watch peace, they view\r\nprosperity, all in real time. They know that they can attain\r\nmore if they work harder.\r\nIf we want to represent their hopes, we have to\r\ncombine wise policies and regional security with market\r\neconomies. Historically we were born equal, and equally we\r\ncan give birth to a new age.\r\n\"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the\r\nplowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ngrapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall\r\ndrop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.\" (The\r\nHoly Bible, Amos 9:13)\r\nSo said the Prophet.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
