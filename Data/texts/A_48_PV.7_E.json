"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n7th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\nTuesday, 28 September 1993\r\nat 3 p.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. ROBERT G. MUGABE,\r\nPRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nMr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Robert Mugabe, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident MUGABE: Allow me to begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Your Excellency Ambassador Samuel\r\nInsanally of the Republic of Guyana, upon your election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly for this forty-eighth\r\nsession. Your well-known diplomatic skills and your\r\ncountry’s long-established positions of principle augur well\r\nfor the successful conduct of the work of this session.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan\r\nGanev of Bulgaria for the able manner in which he steered\r\nthe work of the Assembly during a particularly challenging\r\nforty-seventh session.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to say a special word\r\nof congratulations to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on his outstanding stewardship\r\nof the United Nations during these critical times, when the\r\nworld body is increasingly being called upon to respond\r\npromptly and effectively to complex situations all over the\r\nworld.\r\nAs the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization\r\napproaches, there is great merit in our taking stock of what\r\nthe United Nations has achieved in the maintenance of peace\r\nand security and in fostering international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. It is also our duty at this session to explore\r\nways and means of further strengthening this body so that it\r\nis better equipped to fulfil its purposes and principles as\r\nenshrined in the Charter.\r\nThe admission of new States to the community of\r\nnations upholds the principle of universality that we so much\r\ncherish. In this connection, it is important for us to take\r\nnote of and applaud the historic agreement that has been\r\nsigned by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization,\r\nwhich heralds a period of peace after more than four decades\r\nof bitter and destructive fighting. It is our hope that one day\r\nthe State of Palestine will earn its deserved place as a\r\nMember of this Organization. We would, at the same time,\r\nlike to pay tribute to those countries and organizations that\r\nwere instrumental in bringing the negotiations to a fruitful\r\nconclusion.\r\nThe fact that the membership of this Organization has\r\nincreased dramatically to 184 surely suggests an urgent need\r\nto restructure it so that it serves the world community better\r\nin the vastly changed circumstances. The end of the cold-\r\nwar era has finally placed the United Nations at centre stage\r\nof international affairs for the maintenance of peace and\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86623 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.7\r\n8 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsecurity and the strengthening of international cooperation in\r\nsocial and economic development.\r\nHowever, the arrangements made for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security need a thorough review.\r\nAt a time when great emphasis is being placed on the\r\nprinciple of democracy at the national level, there is no valid\r\nreason for not extending the same principle to the sphere of\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe principle of sovereign equality among States is an\r\nimportant provision of the Charter. The General Assembly\r\nand its style of work represent the embodiment of this\r\nimportant principle. It is the only organ that enjoys\r\nuniversality of membership; therefore, its relationship with\r\nother organs of the Organization should reflect this pre-\r\neminent status. Consequently, in the revitalization and\r\nrestructuring process, the end product should be a\r\nreinvigorated General Assembly capable of asserting itself in\r\nits relationship with other organs of the United Nations.\r\nThe Security Council is assigned by the Charter the\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. The recent proliferation of situations of\r\nconflict, instability and tension around the globe calls for\r\ngreater participation and involvement of the general\r\nmembership in the workings of the Council. There is\r\ntherefore need to adjust its membership, structure and\r\nmethods of work to reflect the changes which have occurred\r\nin international relations since 1945.\r\nThe first obvious change in our Organization is the\r\ndramatic increase in its membership. Consequently, the ratio\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security Council has\r\nprogressively declined from 5 to 1 in 1945, through 8 to 1\r\nin 1965, to 12 to 1 in 1993. Clearly, the Security Council\r\nhas become less representative and needs to be enlarged.\r\nThe second change relates to the configuration of power\r\nin political, economic and military terms which created the\r\nnotion of permanent membership and the veto in the\r\nCouncil. Present realities dictate that the privileges enjoyed\r\nby the permanent members of the Security Council be\r\nmodified and that the composition of the Council be altered,\r\nbut with due regard to the provisions of Article 23,\r\nparagraph, 1 of the Charter, which accords due importance\r\nto\r\n\"the contribution of Members of the United Nations to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and\r\nto the other purposes of the Organization\",\r\nsubject, of course, to membership that is democratically\r\nelected and fully accountable to the total membership of the\r\nOrganization on whose behalf the Security Council acts. It\r\nwill take time to negotiate and put the changes in place.\r\nHowever, in the intervening period there is nothing to\r\nprevent the Organization from implementing interim\r\nmeasures which may go some distance towards redressing\r\nthe present discrepancies.\r\nThe mere expansion of the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil will not amount to much for Africa, Latin America\r\nand Asia unless the question of equitable geographic\r\ndistribution is adequately addressed. At present, these three\r\nregions are grossly underrepresented, in terms of both non-\r\npermanent and permanent members. Africa and Latin\r\nAmerica do not even wield a single veto, whereas the Group\r\nof Western European and Other States, and Eastern Europe,\r\nnow wield four of the five vetoes in the Council. Moreover,\r\nthe Group of Western European and Other States, and\r\nEastern Europe, are allocated 7 of the 15 seats, leaving\r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America to share the remaining 8, an\r\narrangement that is totally inequitable and therefore\r\nunacceptable.\r\nIt is clear that the Security Council, through a liberal\r\ninterpretation of the concept of international peace and\r\nsecurity, has encroached on the jurisdiction of other organs\r\nin the system. We are concerned by the apparent impression\r\noften created by the Council that majority votes in the\r\nCouncil constitute international law, regardless of the\r\nprovisions of the Charter and other relevant international\r\nstatutes.\r\nThe Security Council acts on behalf of the entire United\r\nNations membership. Therefore, any tendencies or practices\r\nthat may be interpreted as contradicting the norms and\r\nprinciples of transparency, accountability and democracy\r\nshould be avoided. To this end, we should evolve a system\r\nthat would ensure more participation by interested Member\r\nStates that are not members of the Security Council. This\r\nwill make it possible for such Members to have a\r\nmeaningful input during the informal meetings of the\r\nSecurity Council. It is also desirable that the Council keep\r\nthe general membership well informed regarding the stage\r\nand nature of discussions and negotiations undertaken.\r\nIf we have addressed ourselves at some length to the\r\nissue of the Security Council it is because the responsibilities\r\nit shoulders have manifestly increased in number and\r\ncomplexity. It is our view that only through a process of\r\ninternal institutional reform, which we believe is long\r\noverdue, can the moral authority and effectiveness of the\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 3\r\nSecurity Council in discharging its mandate be enhanced and\r\nacknowledged. It is our hope that the current negotiations\r\non this matter will be successfully concluded to coincide\r\nwith the celebrations marking the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations in 1995.\r\nI now turn to the vital role of the Assembly as the\r\ncentral and universal forum for deliberation. Africa fully\r\nsupports the efforts under way to revitalize and rationalize\r\nthe work of the General Assembly. We believe that the\r\nexercise must be comprehensive, taking into account the\r\nexpanded membership of the world body as well as the\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality of all States. The reform\r\nprocess must also fully address the need for the other\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations system to report to\r\nthe General Assembly, as provided in the Charter.\r\nAs I have already noted, the tasks facing the United\r\nNations today have increased with the unprecedented\r\nmushrooming of peace-keeping operations all over the world.\r\nBitter armed conflicts continue to ravage lives and destroy\r\nproperty, stretching the much-needed administrative and\r\nfinancial resources of the Organization to the limit. Let us\r\ntherefore redouble our efforts in support of the increased\r\ncommitment and responsibilities of our Organization.\r\nThe recent successes of the United Nations in bringing\r\npeace to Cambodia, El Salvador and Haiti and in facilitating\r\nthe referendum in Eritrea are testimony to what can be\r\nachieved by our Organization acting in a concerted manner.\r\nIt is in this context that we particularly welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals in his report \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\", relating to cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations in resolving conflicts, in\r\npeacemaking as well as peace building. We in Africa have\r\ntaken a positive step in this direction. At the thirtieth\r\nsummit meeting of the Organization of Africa Unity (OAU),\r\nheld at Cairo in June this year, we adopted a mechanism\r\nwhose primary objective is the anticipation and prevention\r\nof conflicts. Its mandate will be guided by the principles of\r\nthe OAU Charter, in particular the sovereign equality of\r\nStates. Where conflicts have already occurred, the function\r\nof this mechanism will be peacemaking and peace building.\r\nEven with our meagre resources, we are proud to say that\r\nAfrica has already established a Special Fund to support\r\nOAU activities in conflict prevention and settlement.\r\nIn southern Africa we continue to be bedeviled by\r\nconflicts in Angola, Mozambique and South Africa. In\r\nMozambique, however, we welcome the recent talks between\r\nPresident Chissano and RENAMO leader Afondo Dhlakama,\r\nwhich have cleared some of the major obstacles to the peace\r\nprocess. We therefore urge the United Nations to continue\r\nits efforts to put the peace process back on schedule to\r\nenable elections to be held in October 1994.\r\nIn Angola we are gravely concerned at the continued\r\nescalation of fighting between UNITA and the legitimate\r\nMPLA Government. This has caused untold loss of life and\r\nproperty. We believe that the efforts of the United Nations\r\nand the OAU should be aimed at achieving a cease-fire\r\nbetween the two warring parties and creating favourable\r\ncircumstances for the deployment of United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping operations while negotiations for peace take place.\r\nUNITA should accept the results of the September 1992\r\ndemocratic elections, which were declared free and fair by\r\ninternational observers, including the United Nations.\r\nOn South Africa, we applaud and support the current\r\nnegotiations to bring about democratic change in that\r\ncountry, particularly the recent agreement regarding the\r\nfuture, and indeed ongoing, establishment of the Transitional\r\nExecutive Council. We are, however, dismayed to note the\r\nintensification of violence and the withdrawal of the Inkatha\r\nFreedom Party and the white conservatives from the\r\nnegotiations. These actions threaten the smooth progress\r\ntowards the goal of democratic elections currently set for\r\nApril 1994. We therefore urge the two parties to return to\r\nthe negotiating table, as this is the only way forward. The\r\nUnited Nations should also seriously consider a more active\r\nrole in the prevention of violence.\r\nThe President of the African National Congress (ANC)\r\nhas appealed to the United Nations for the ending of\r\nsanctions against South Africa, and we are glad that there\r\nhas been response from a number of countries to that appeal.\r\nZimbabwe fully supports the appeal, and we are glad that a\r\nstage has now been reached when we can judge the process\r\nto be more or less irreversible.\r\nIn Somalia we commend the efforts of the United\r\nNations in the difficult mission to restore normalcy to that\r\ntortured country. In Liberia and Rwanda, while peace has\r\nremained elusive, we are glad that current OAU and United\r\nNations efforts to resolve the crises have begun to bear fruit.\r\nIt is our hope that recent positive developments on the long-\r\nstanding question of Western Sahara will result in a just and\r\nequitable settlement. The untiring efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the United Nations in seeking lasting solutions\r\nto these conflicts on our continent and elsewhere,\r\nparticularly those emanating from the disintegration of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, deserve our\r\nunqualified support.\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nAs equal members of this family of nations, we believe\r\nthat peace-keeping, peace-building and peacemaking must\r\nnot be the preserve of a few economically or politically\r\npowerful countries. We stand ready to cooperate with the\r\ninternational community in seeking solutions to the many\r\nproblems facing the world today, by participating in peace-\r\nkeeping operations or mediation efforts, or by providing any\r\nfacilities or expertise at our disposal. However, unless all\r\nMember States commit themselves to timely payments of\r\ntheir assessed contributions for these efforts, some countries\r\nwill find continued participation difficult.\r\nWe are fully aware that issues involving violent\r\ndisputes or armed conflicts are not the only concerns of the\r\ninternational community. Other issues, such as trade and\r\neconomic growth, as well as international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, are matters of primary concern. We note with\r\nconcern from the World Economic Survey, 1993 that for the\r\nthird year in succession the rate of growth of world output\r\nin 1993 will be below that of world population. It is also\r\nevident from the Survey that the end of the East-West\r\nideological divide has not brought with it a commensurate\r\nnarrowing of the economic disparities between North and\r\nSouth. Instead, these disparities have become more\r\npronounced than ever before.\r\nThe problems confronting the developing countries\r\ntoday are manifold. Terms of trade continue to deteriorate,\r\nas high prices of imported manufactured goods and rising\r\nprotectionism in developed countries become the order of the\r\nday. The socio-economic crisis in the developing countries\r\nhas been further exacerbated by the crippling burden of debt.\r\nThe flows of official development assistance, upon which\r\nthey are dependent, has declined in recent years, while direct\r\ninvestment has constituted only a marginal percentage of all\r\ninflows to these countries, particularly those in Africa.\r\nIn Africa, the least developed and most marginalized of\r\nall the world’s regions, the majority of countries are\r\nundertaking economic reform measures. They have made\r\ngreat sacrifices and encountered untold difficulties in\r\nimplementing these reforms. In southern and eastern Africa\r\nin particular, the capacity to implement and keep these\r\neconomic reforms on course was further undermined by the\r\ndevastating drought which swept the region in 1991-1992.\r\nYet these countries have continued to demonstrate their\r\ncommitment to the reforms aimed at improving the standard\r\nof living of their people.\r\nOur sacrifices alone are not enough to ensure the\r\nsuccess of our economic reform programmes. In this regard,\r\nwe must once again reiterate the imperative need for an open\r\nand equitable international trading system and the provision\r\nof adequate financial resources. We therefore call for an\r\nearly conclusion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade\r\nNegotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\r\n(GATT). We also call again on the developed countries to\r\nachieve without further delay the target of 0.7 per cent of\r\ntheir gross national product for official development\r\nassistance that was set over 24 years ago by this very\r\nAssembly.\r\nAfrica’s economic and social progress in general, and\r\nin the context of the implementation of the New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s in particular, will\r\nremain severely hampered as long as the continent’s debt\r\nburden continues to be as acute as it is today. Standing at\r\nclose to $290 billion at the end of 1992, the continent’s debt\r\nis equivalent to 100.1 per cent of its gross national product,\r\nwhile it is an alarming 108 per cent for sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nWith Africa continuing to be a net exporter of financial\r\nresources, is it any wonder that many of our human\r\ndevelopment needs and social services have gone unmet?\r\nWe believe that there is a clear and compelling need to\r\nfind a lasting solution to Africa’s indebtedness. While we\r\nwelcome some of the positive steps taken by some creditor\r\ncountries towards debt relief, as well as the important\r\ninitiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions in this regard,\r\nwe believe that an unacceptable gap still remains between\r\nrhetoric and action, and that more decisive measures can be\r\ntaken to address this crisis.\r\nAfrica believes that the commitment it made together\r\nwith the international community, when the New Agenda\r\nwas adopted in 1991, must be renewed and translated into\r\nconcrete action. Fully cognizant of the fact that Africa’s\r\ndevelopment is primarily our responsibility, we have\r\nproceeded courageously to implement our side of the\r\ncommitment, particularly in the promotion of regional and\r\nsub-regional economic cooperation and integration and the\r\ncreation of an enabling environment for foreign and\r\ndomestic investment. We therefore call upon the\r\ninternational community to buttress our efforts by addressing\r\nin a concerted manner the major constraints which I have\r\nhighlighted.\r\nAfrica does not seek charity. Mindful of the need to\r\npromote sustainable and self-sustaining development on the\r\nbasis of self-reliance and the interdependence of Member\r\nStates, the countries of Southern Africa signed in August\r\n1992 a regional treaty establishing the Southern Africa\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC). Foremost among our\r\nobjectives are the achievement - through regional\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 5\r\nintegration - of development and economic growth, the\r\nalleviation of poverty, the enhancement of the standard and\r\nquality of life and the support of the socially disadvantaged.\r\nThrough the various regional economic organizations\r\nsuch as the Eastern and Southern African Preferential Trade\r\nArea (PTA), the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS), and the Arab Maghreb Union, African\r\ncountries are trying to further their aim of achieving self-\r\nsustaining development. These efforts will eventually\r\nculminate in the formation of an African Economic\r\nCommunity, whose foundations have already been laid.\r\nFurthermore, it is our objective to evolve common political\r\nvalues, systems and institutions, and to promote and defend\r\npeace and security in the region. It is our earnest hope that\r\nthe international community as well as organs of the United\r\nNations system and the multilateral financial institutions will\r\ncontinue to render their invaluable and generous assistance\r\nin order to ensure the success of our regional integration\r\nefforts.\r\nZimbabwe is fully committed to achieving the\r\nsustainable utilization of our natural resources and the\r\nprotection of our environment in order to attain sustainable\r\ndevelopment. In this context, we note with appreciation the\r\nprogress made so far in establishing the institutional\r\nmechanism for the follow-up of the decisions taken during\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June last year. In\r\nparticular, we commend the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment for the constructive and positive manner in\r\nwhich it conducted its work during its first substantive\r\nsession in June.\r\nWe welcome the stress that the Commission has placed\r\non some of the areas critical to the successful\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, including the urgent need to\r\nsupport national efforts to achieve sustainable consumption\r\nand production patterns and lifestyles and the need for a\r\nsupportive international economic environment.\r\nIssues such as the alleviation and reduction of poverty,\r\nthe creation of remunerative and productive employment and\r\nsocial integration are at the core of the endeavours of all\r\ncountries, but more urgently of developing countries. It is\r\nappropriate that these constitute the basis of our deliberations\r\nwhen we convene in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995\r\nfor the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nThese themes are all equally vital. It is gratifying that\r\nthe international community has pronounced itself on them\r\non many occasions as indeed have States individually and\r\nseverally. The theme of social integration, for example, was\r\naddressed in a special way when two years ago we held a\r\nsummit meeting on children here in New York. We adopted\r\nprinciples and guidelines which should govern the treatment\r\nand development of children in all our countries. We\r\nshould, in translating these principles into practice, work to\r\nremove the status and stigma of society’s marginal people\r\nfrom our children. The children are our future. We have a\r\nduty to the future for them by the positive and practical\r\nmeasures we take today for their protection, education and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOf great importance to us also are issues of population\r\nand the advancement of women. In this context we\r\nwelcome and support the convening of the World\r\nConference on Population and Development in 1994 in\r\nCairo, Egypt, and of the World Conference on Women in\r\nBeijing, China, in 1995.\r\nIn this regard let me underscore the conclusion of the\r\nWorld Economic Survey 1993 that the social concerns of\r\ndeveloping countries, and the major issues of development\r\nin other areas of the world, cannot be resolved in the\r\nabsence of world economic growth. It is our fervent hope\r\nthat just as the United Nations has considerably strengthened\r\nits role in the political and humanitarian fields, its role in the\r\neconomic, social and related fields will likewise be\r\nstrengthened in order adequately to meet the emerging new\r\nrealities and their impact on the developing countries.\r\nLet me conclude by calling upon all Member States to\r\nremember that just as the new international situation dictates\r\nthe need to strengthen, democratize and streamline the\r\noperations of the United Nations and its constituent bodies,\r\nso also is it incumbent upon us to make an exceptional\r\ncontribution in pursuit of the noble goals of justice, peace\r\nand development. This we believe can be achieved only if\r\nall Members live up to their obligations under the Charter.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nMrs. Fritsche (Liechtenstein), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. FRANJO TUDJMAN, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Croatia.\r\nMr. Franjo Tudjman, President of the Republic of\r\nCroatia, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Croatia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Franjo Tudjman, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident TUDJMAN (spoke in Croatian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Throughout the half century of\r\nits history the United Nations has never rallied a greater\r\nnumber of Member States and has never played a more\r\nprominent role in global and regional international relations,\r\nthan it does today, and it has never borne the brunt of such\r\nproblems as it bears today. This, the forty-eighth session of\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly, is being held in an\r\natmosphere of great hope and of even greater commitments\r\nfacing the Organization which, in this post-cold-war time,\r\nfollowing the historical collapse of communism and\r\nmultinational State communities in Europe, is becoming the\r\ncardinal guardian of global peace and security.\r\nThe fall of Soviet and other European Communist and\r\ntotalitarian systems has reinforced hope and provided the\r\nprerequisites for the comprehensive democratization of the\r\nworld while simultaneously raising the question of what kind\r\nof multilateralism is required and possible in the\r\ncontemporary world. Of no lesser importance is the question\r\nof the new role of the United Nations at a time when many\r\nnew States are coming into being and when the\r\nstrengthening of global peace is becoming the fundamental\r\nideology of mankind. The United Nations must shoulder the\r\nresponsibility for a more equitable global order to take hold\r\nin every corner of the world. But, in order to achieve this\r\ngoal, one must thoroughly review multilateral mechanisms\r\nas well as the activity of international organizations under\r\nconditions of the emergence of many new States, the end of\r\nbipolarity and the strengthening of the polycentric foundation\r\nof the world.\r\nThe process of disintegration of the Soviet communist\r\nsystem, which began with the fall of the Berlin Wall, led\r\ntowards a fundamental shift in relations, not only within\r\nEurope, but also on a global scale. It has redirected and\r\ndrafted new American-Russian and American-European\r\nrelations. The competitive wars of the great Powers bent on\r\ngaining influence and predominance in the Third World have\r\nalmost died away, but the focus of regional crises has now\r\nmoved to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and to the area\r\nof the former Soviet Union, because of the profound\r\npolitical, national, social and economic changes sweeping\r\nthose areas. International factors, primarily West European\r\nand North American countries, were taken unawares by the\r\ndepth and speed of these historical changes. Their initial\r\ndisorientation turned, subsequently, into a renewal of\r\ndormant traditional competition for spheres of influence in\r\nchanging circumstances. On the international scene, the\r\nultimate result has been disunity and the inefficiency of the\r\nmost responsible international factors in dealing with volatile\r\nregional crises, but such developments have also jeopardized\r\nthe European integration processes already under way. The\r\nfundamental values and goals of European regional\r\norganizations now face a serious test and a radical review of\r\ntheir mission. The new system of European collective\r\nsecurity is yet to take hold, and the same holds true for the\r\nsystem of general, global security. This is a matter of the\r\ngreatest importance because the security of small countries\r\nhas become the key to the stability of each region and of the\r\noverall international system.\r\nThe world has been slow to accept, and slower to\r\nunderstand, the changes involving the national and State\r\nemancipation of old and new European and Asian nations,\r\nand it has recognized their international identity with\r\nreluctance. The world has found it hard to grasp the at-first\r\nuntenable contradiction implied in the fact that we have\r\nentered a period, in the development of human society and\r\ninternational relations, of the broadest national\r\nindividualization based on a most comprehensive\r\ncivilizational integration. Even worse, the world has not\r\nbeen ready to face the difficulties and the temporarily\r\ndestabilizing consequences of such changes, which will\r\nultimately lead to the full democratization of international\r\nrelations.\r\nThe view that the collapse of communist systems and\r\nof Soviet domination over nations in the Soviet Union and\r\nEastern Europe had resolved the problem of regional and\r\ninternational stability was wrong. There was a similar lack\r\nof understanding of the fact that the process of internal and\r\ninternational democratization cannot stop at the mere\r\ndemocratization of political systems, and that it also\r\ninevitably leads to the disintegration of multinational State\r\nformations. This was the logical sequence of political\r\ndemocratization and national emancipation.\r\nThere can no longer be any doubt today about the fact\r\nthat the ever-increasing functional integration of the world\r\nwas the very prerequisite of national independence and\r\ninternal sociopolitical and international democratization.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 7\r\nThis has only seemingly been a contradictory process.\r\nSpecifically, because of their endangered position, small\r\nnations and their States are anxious to preserve their own\r\nState, cultural and economic identity, and this sustains not\r\nonly the variety but also the very development of the world.\r\nIt should be remembered that positive nationalism, that is,\r\nthe national-democratic movement of oppressed nations in\r\nEastern Europe and of oppressed stateless nations in other\r\nparts of the world, deserves the greatest credit for the\r\ncollapse of the communist systems.\r\nHaving achieved their national sovereignty and the\r\nindependence of their State, small nations, in their own\r\ninterest, became supporters of \"civilizational\" integration and\r\ndemocratization. This is the reason why one of the most\r\nimportant goals of the international community today should\r\nbe the successful resolution of problems affecting complete\r\nregional and international integration of States having\r\nemerged after the disintegration of communist systems in\r\nformer multinational States such as the Soviet Union,\r\nYugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.\r\nThe new world order which is being created so\r\nlaboriously, but also of necessity, can no longer be based\r\nonly on the ascendancy of the anti-fascist coalition or of the\r\nnuclear Power club. Half a century after the historic victory\r\nover fascism, new economic and political realities have come\r\ninto being, and the countries against which the anti-fascist\r\nalliance was directed cannot bear the liability of the past\r\nindefinitely. Germany, Japan, Italy and the countries within\r\ntheir international political spheres during the Second World\r\nWar are today democratic countries with huge developmental\r\npower, which is also obviously beneficial to the world.\r\nSimilarly, the fundamental political and other eventful\r\nchanges taking place in Russia are transforming that country,\r\ncurrently in the throes of dramatic upheaval, from a former\r\nStalinist threat to international peace and order into, we\r\nhope, a constructive component of global order built on new\r\nfoundations of equality and partnership of nations and States\r\nfor the sake of mutual benefit and the stability of peace.\r\nThe balance of military blocs, weapons and ideologies\r\nestablished during the cold war was only seemingly a stable\r\nsystem, because it was actually founded on repression or\r\ndependency, first of all at the expense of small States or\r\nstateless nations. Today, to quote Secretary-General Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, \"Multilateralism is the democracy of\r\ninternational society.\" (The New York Times,\r\n20 August 1993, p. A29, \"Don’t Make the U.N.’s Hard Job\r\nHarder\")\r\nMultilateralism, certainly! But of what kind? We must\r\ntend towards a multilateralism that will help us - after a gory\r\nhistory of strife, first between dynasties, then between States\r\nand, finally, between imperialist or ideological-military blocs\r\n- to avoid war between incompatible civilizations. A brutal\r\nentanglement of these civilizational contrasts is taking place\r\nprecisely in the area of the former Yugoslavia, threatening\r\nto polarize greater areas along the lines of separation and\r\nconflict between civilizational-religious blocs. We should\r\ntend, instead, to internal, regional and global relations in\r\nwhich these civilizational spheres will blend productively\r\nand reinforce their identity through peaceful competition,\r\ninstead of wasting their precious potential on mutual\r\nconfrontation and annihilation.\r\nA new multilateralism capable of coping with the\r\nepoch-making changes of our time also calls for a thorough\r\nreform of the United Nations. This implies, primarily, the\r\nstrengthening of international law, but also the development\r\nof mechanisms which will help the United Nations and its\r\nagencies to function more effectively and to be depoliticized,\r\nless costly and more receptive to ideas, influences and\r\nsupervision.\r\nIn particular, the role and responsibility of the Security\r\nCouncil in dealing with questions concerning international\r\npeace and stability should be given greater emphasis. Over\r\npast years there has been considerable progress in the\r\noperation of the Security Council, and the use of the veto\r\nhas almost become obsolete. Nevertheless, certain Security\r\nCouncil decisions are still excessively influenced by the\r\nnational interests of its members, the permanent ones in\r\nparticular. Accordingly, we need a climate of cooperation\r\nin the Security Council that will prevent its being used as an\r\nextended instrument of the foreign policy of individual\r\nSecurity Council members.\r\nCroatia supports extension of the permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council, which will reflect the\r\neconomic and political realities of the present-day world and\r\nassure a balanced regional representation in the Council.\r\nCroatia also endorses the limitation of the right and practice\r\nof veto. The major crises of our time, such as the one in the\r\narea of the former Yugoslavia, should be used as precious\r\nlessons for more effective and concerted action by the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe also believe that a high degree of responsibility and\r\nauthority in decisions concerning the major directions of\r\nglobal economic and social development should also be\r\nvested in the Economic and Social Council, so that its\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ndecisions, in specific areas of decision-making, would have\r\nexecutive force similar to that of Security Council decisions.\r\nAlthough it would be difficult to envisage the General\r\nAssembly assuming the role of a global parliament to the\r\ndetriment of the sovereignty of Member States, a clearer\r\ndelimitation of authority among the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council\r\nwould nevertheless be required. A more articulated link\r\nwith United Nations agencies, which ought to improve their\r\nefficiency and prevent the political blocking of certain\r\nprocesses, is also necessary. However, the enhanced role of\r\nthe Security Council, which we are advocating, should not\r\naffect the authority of the General Assembly, which is a\r\nforum for the manifestation of the views of the vast majority\r\nof small countries Members of the United Nations. As a\r\nform of present-day democracy, multilateralism should\r\nprovide the foundation for the stability of the new and, in\r\nevery respect, democratic world order. However, while\r\nstriving to turn our global Organization into a most\r\nconsonant orchestra which will provide for the full\r\nexpression of the voices of all differences and contrasts,\r\nnatural-permanent and secondary-provisional ones alike, we\r\nmust never lose sight of uncontroverted historical\r\nexperience - namely, that the role and, hence, the\r\nresponsibility, of the small and the greatest components and\r\nlines of force in international life are not and cannot be\r\nidentical throughout all events, times and circumstances.\r\nBecause of this we should continue to build global\r\norganization on the efficient activity of the Security Council\r\nand, within it, on the role and responsibility of its permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nThe central point with reference to the efficient role of\r\nthe Security Council, and of the entire United Nations, is the\r\nneed to develop a new foundation for peace mediation.\r\nEstablished in cold-war times, the mechanism was adjusted\r\nto the need to prevent the outbreak and spread of conflict\r\nbetween the blocs, or between their dependants in the third\r\nworld, with long-term freezing of conflict as the goal.\r\nToday peace mediation requires a much more active and\r\nflexible approach, first of all because of the need and\r\npossibility of preventive action, but also because of a\r\nselective use of force in the implementation of peace\r\nagreements and Security Council decisions. The example of\r\nmy country, the Republic of Croatia, and that of the\r\nneighbouring Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\npinpointed most exactly the two fundamental weaknesses of\r\nthe existing peace-keeping-force model and mandate. First,\r\nthe classic mandate, the freezing of the conflict by sustaining\r\na cease-fire, does not resolve the conflict but, rather, creates\r\nfurther complications. Second, as has become manifest,\r\ncertain countries whose forces are engaged in the\r\nimplementation of the multilateral peace mandate are trying,\r\nthrough the members of their peace-keeping units and\r\nnegotiation mediators, to pursue their national policies and\r\nnot the policy of the Security Council.\r\nThe reform of the overall peace-operation mechanism\r\nrequires, first and foremost, a more efficient use of\r\ncoordinated instruments of diplomatic, economic, political\r\nand military pressure and consistency in the implementation\r\nof the peace-keeping-force mandate. Such an approach,\r\nwhich also implies the selective use of force, not only could\r\nhave prevented the escalation of the conflict in the former\r\nYugoslavia but also reduced peace-keeping-forces’ casualties\r\nto fewer than have actually been the case with the present\r\nstatic mandate, which does not offer adequate protection\r\neven to the peace-keeping force itself.\r\nIn recent years extensive positive, but also negative,\r\nexperience has been acquired in the conduct of\r\npeace-keeping operations in Croatia, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Somalia and Cambodia. It has been found that\r\npeace-keeping forces should be more qualified and better\r\ntrained and equipped for special missions in each peace-\r\nkeeping operation. The United Nations should also have\r\ngreater authority in the sensitive conduct of peace-keeping\r\noperations. This suggests the need for the establishment of\r\nalready well-trained and prepared national military\r\ncontingents to be available, with all their facilities, to the\r\nglobal community. Under the current system, in the best of\r\ncases several months are required for unit selection and the\r\nprovision of necessary facilities for the deployment of\r\npeace-keeping forces in specific areas, which results in\r\ndelayed action and substantially affects the conditions of\r\npeace-keeping-mandate implementation. It has also become\r\nevident that regional organizations, regional military\r\nalliances and systems in particular, can in the majority of\r\ncases be the main and most efficient mechanism to\r\nimplement peace-keeping operations. Peace-keeping\r\noperations are being used at an ever-increasing rate to\r\nprevent disastrous humanitarian situations or to alleviate their\r\nconsequences, but they will still have a role to play in\r\npolitical mediation and organization of the basic State\r\ninstitutions, as well as in supervising political and economic\r\nreconstruction in the initial period. Such United Nations\r\noperations of an increasingly more comprehensive scope call\r\nfor the cooperation of the entire international community in\r\nthe implementation of regularly highly complex missions.\r\nThe international community must act through the Security\r\nCouncil whenever there is obvious aggression against a\r\nMember State, as well as in cases where international\r\nsecurity is seriously threatened. Selective interventionism\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 9\r\nmainly has an adverse effect on the reputation and credibility\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nEconomic sanctions are becoming, at an ever-increasing\r\nrate, an instrument of international pressure in the absence\r\nof political will to use stronger means to implement Security\r\nCouncil resolutions or to protect basic interests of Member\r\nStates and promote international law standards. In our view,\r\nsanctions can have an effect only if combined with other\r\ninstruments of international pressure and isolation.\r\nHowever, what is also required is a more efficient system of\r\ncompensating those countries which subsequently have to\r\nbear, with no guilt on their part, the burden of sanctions\r\nagainst specific regimes. A more effective system is also\r\nneeded to supervise the implementation of sanctions through\r\nthe enforcement of \"sanctions imposed for violations of\r\nsanctions\". In the opposite case, the sanctions, to be sure,\r\nwill have a long-term effect, but before the ultimate\r\nobjective is achieved the highest price will be paid by the\r\ninnocent population of the affected country, by people who\r\ncannot deal by themselves with the internationally censured\r\nregime.\r\nThe democratization of international relations and a new\r\nmultilateralism also imply a greater commitment of the\r\ninternational community to the safeguarding and respect of\r\nhuman rights, the punishment of the violators of\r\nhumanitarian and war law and the protection of the\r\necological balance of the planet. Although we uphold the\r\nview that the defence of cardinal rights and international law\r\nstandards cannot take precedence over the sovereignty of\r\nUnited Nations Member States, regimes and individuals that\r\nviolate such rights and standards may not be allowed to hide\r\nbehind the principle of \"non-interference with internal\r\nmatters of countries\". Balance should be sought in\r\nreconciling the two approaches, and the ways in which, and\r\nconditions under which, international mechanisms can be set\r\nin motion ought to be codified in the safeguarding of\r\nuniversal human rights and interests in order to preserve\r\npeace and the international order.\r\nBecause of its own experience - the orchestrated military\r\nrevolt of part of the Serbian population organized from\r\nBelgrade, resulting in the occupation of one quarter of\r\nCroatia’s territory - the Republic of Croatia supports\r\ncooperation with the international community in the\r\nidentification and incorporation of the highest standards of\r\nprotection of the Serbian minority into Croatian legislation.\r\nWe accept international supervision of their implementation\r\nin the interest of inter-ethnic reconciliation,\r\nconfidence-building and the future stability of the country\r\nand the greater area.\r\nOf course, the responsibility which the United Nations\r\nshould assume at an ever-increasing rate in crisis areas,\r\nrelief operations, protection of the environment and\r\nassurance of balanced development, as well as in other\r\nissues of general interest, requires vast financial resources.\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the regular budget and the\r\nfinancing of peace-keeping operations have assumed such\r\nkey importance among the matters to be discussed at this,\r\nthe forty-eighth, session of the General Assembly. Part of\r\nthese outlays can be reduced by a more economical use of\r\nexisting resources and by improving the efficiency of the\r\nUnited Nations system itself. We should prevent United\r\nNations actions from becoming an end in themselves, and\r\navenues should also be explored towards greater\r\nprogramming coordination with other organizations and\r\ninitiatives within the international system. Greater care\r\nought to be exercised in preventing all instances of abuse\r\nand corruption within the United Nations system, because\r\nthey not only increase the cost but also undermine the\r\nreputation of the global Organization.\r\nThe global community is saddled with many adversities\r\nand crises, but the international order is nevertheless\r\nbecoming more and more settled. We are encouraged by the\r\nfact that, after half a century of Israeli-Arab conflict, the\r\nway has finally been paved towards more stable peace in the\r\nMiddle East. This example can also be instructive with\r\nregard to the solution of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nIt demonstrates the practical use and advantage of carefully\r\nworded agreements which are possible especially when their\r\nresolution actively involves the leading world power as well.\r\nSuch cases call on both sides for statesmanship and courage\r\nin making concessions for the sake of peace and require\r\nrealism in the assessment of national interests with regard to\r\nobjective international circumstances and the particular\r\nhistorical moment. The statesmen involved, and the\r\nresponsible officers of the global Organization, are expected\r\nto be reasonable and principled, determined but also\r\nmoderate, in a way allowing for no narrow-minded\r\nradicalism, but tending rather to seek the most favourable\r\nsolution for the protection of peace and the international\r\norder.\r\nWe are also encouraged to see that conditions are being\r\nestablished for the withdrawal of the peace-keeping forces\r\nfrom Cambodia early next year. This gives us hope that a\r\nsimilar process will also be completed in the Republic of\r\nCroatia in the immediate future, and in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina in the nearest possible future.\r\nWe welcome the evident progress attained in the\r\ntransfer of power to the black majority in the South African\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nRepublic. We hope that the sporadic cases of racial and\r\npolitical violence in that country are only aftershocks\r\nfollowing the major political shifts towards racial tolerance\r\nand democratization of political life in that country. We are\r\nconvinced that the international community will also find the\r\nmeans to succeed in the already initiated and then halted\r\nprocess of political stabilization in Angola and Mozambique.\r\nWe also believe that resoluteness of the United Nations is\r\nalso required in the area of the former Yugoslavia, just as it\r\nhas been in Somalia, in terms of selective use of force,\r\nprotection of the peace force and assurance of relief. But in\r\nSomalia as well, the international community must also\r\nassume broader responsibilities in the restoration of the basic\r\nfunctions of the State and in the establishment of law and\r\norder in that country. It is obvious that differences in the\r\napproach to the solution of problems which frustrate the\r\nefficiency of the peace-keeping forces stem not from\r\noperative but from political reasons.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia welcomes the efforts of the\r\nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the\r\nEuropean Community and the United Nations to mediate\r\npeace in the conflicts between or within the former Soviet\r\nrepublics, and we express our readiness to take part in these\r\npeace efforts. Fortified by its own experience, Croatia will\r\nbe ready, especially after the end of the war in the Republic,\r\nto contribute even more to the new mission of peace-keeping\r\noperations throughout the world.\r\nAs a country of outstanding natural attractions, but also\r\nof a very vulnerable environmental system, the Republic of\r\nCroatia will consistently implement the commitments of the\r\nAction Plan - Agenda 21 - the conclusions of the Conference\r\non the Environment and Development and the Rio\r\ndeclarations.\r\nCroatia believes that support of the programme of\r\nsustainable development is the proper way towards the\r\ngradual bridging of the growing developmental gap between\r\nthe North and the South, which is a permanent source of\r\npolitical and social instability and ecological imbalance in\r\nspecific areas and in the world as a whole.\r\nThe crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia is the\r\nmost difficult crisis in the world today, and it cannot be\r\nresolved without a more determined role on the part of the\r\ninternational community. Past mediation efforts have been\r\nshown to be insufficient because they were limited by a\r\nmandate lacking firmness, but also rendered more difficult\r\nby the diverse political interests of individual external forces.\r\nIt has not been sufficient to try to freeze the conflict, send\r\nin humanitarian aid and engage in empty threats, thus\r\nallowing the crisis to deteriorate to the point where\r\n\"everybody would get tired of waging war\" and then agree\r\nto a political settlement. The initial aggression of the\r\nYugoslav communist army, Serbia and Montenegro, for the\r\nconquest of Croat and Muslim territories was not countered\r\nby determined steps, and the consequences of such a policy\r\nhave been disastrous. They have included first and foremost\r\nthe terrible destruction and \"ethnic cleansing\" in areas\r\nconquered by the Serbs, and then the extension of the\r\nconflict to the Muslim and Croat sides as well, the struggle\r\nfor the remaining territory, the incessant growth of the death\r\ntoll, and the ever swelling tide of refugees, which has now\r\nexceeded the figure of one million agonized men, women\r\nand children.\r\nIn the Republic of Croatia the United Nations\r\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR) mandate achieved certain\r\ninitial results in putting a stop to fighting and providing for\r\nthe withdrawal of the Yugoslav army. However, the\r\nmandate has been misused by the Serbian extremist\r\ninsurgents and their promoters, the Belgrade expansionists,\r\nto freeze territorial gains, continue \"ethnic cleansing,\" and\r\nconsolidate occupation which has assumed forms of\r\nterrorism even at the expense of the local Serbian\r\npopulation. The international community has allowed the\r\nSerbian side to completely ignore all Security Council\r\nresolutions and other agreements, in spite of the fact that the\r\nmodalities of resolving the conflict have been clearly and\r\nwell defined: complete cease-fire and the disarmament of\r\nSerbian paramilitary units; the return of all refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons to their homes; the normalization of traffic\r\nand supply; the guarantee of extensive ethnic rights to the\r\nSerbian minority within the scope of the territorial integrity\r\nand sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia; the gradual\r\nreinstatement of Croatian authorities and of law and order in\r\nthe occupied areas; confidence-building measures; scheduling\r\nof elections for local self-government authorities; and\r\ngeneral amnesty for all persons not found guilty of war\r\ncrimes.\r\nOwing to the lack of determination on the part of the\r\ninternational community in the implementation of the\r\nUNPROFOR mandate, the Republic of Croatia has found\r\nitself, through no fault of its own, in a position where\r\npressure is being brought to bear on it, including even\r\nthreats of sanctions, because it is trying to deal with its vital\r\ncommunications problems, or prevent Croatian towns from\r\nbeing shelled from areas under the protection of the\r\npeace-keeping forces. Thus, Croatia is being taken to task\r\nfor reinstating civilian traffic across the Maslenica Strait, on\r\nwhich a million people in southern Croatia and parts of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina depend. Croatia is first urged to\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 11\r\nnegotiate and normalize relations with Belgrade, and then\r\naccused of doing so. Meanwhile, nothing efficient is being\r\ndone to disarm Serbian paramilitary units and to prevent\r\nSerbian extremism and terrorism in the United Nations\r\nprotected areas.\r\nOne of the basic concepts of our policy has been the\r\nguarantee of the most comprehensive rights for all\r\nminorities - including of course the Serbian minority as a\r\nwhole, and particularly in the areas of Croatia in which the\r\nSerbs constituted a majority before the war - in the interest\r\nof the future permanent stability of the Croatian State and of\r\nits role within the international order. However, at the same\r\ntime the Serbian insurgents must provide for the return of\r\nhundreds of thousands of displaced Croats and other\r\nnon-Serbian citizens to their homes in the areas under the\r\nprotection of the peace-keeping forces. Belgrade must\r\nfinally recognize the Republic of Croatia and its borders, as\r\nthe whole world has already done. Croatia cannot tolerate\r\na situation in which the Serbian minority abuses its rights in\r\norder to break up the Croatian State or to create the legal\r\nframework for the secession of territories under local\r\nself-government and their annexation to the \"federation of\r\nSerbian lands\". This would mean the realization of the\r\nGreater Serbia idea, which was precisely the underlying\r\nmotive of the present war against Croatia and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. The sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro\r\nmust remain in force until peace is achieved in Croatia, too,\r\nand not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as is also provided\r\nfor by the respective Security Council resolutions. Croatia\r\nresolutely urges the consistent and effective implementation\r\nof all Security Council resolutions - no more, but no less\r\neither.\r\nCroatia has shown extreme patience within the scope of\r\nendeavours for a peaceful settlement of the conflict with the\r\nSerbian minority, orchestrated during the time the former\r\nsocialist Yugoslavia was disintegrating and the democratic\r\nState of Croatia was being established. However, Croatia\r\ncannot tolerate indefinitely the occupation of its territories,\r\nthe pressure of the hundreds of thousands of displaced\r\npersons from Croatian areas, and a situation in which the\r\nState is split. Croatia can no longer be forced to accept the\r\nfourth extension of the UNPROFOR mandate if the mission\r\nof the peace-keeping forces is not specified in more resolute\r\nterms, and if the Serbs are not given an ultimatum to\r\nimplement the Vance Plan and all relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions. The means used to bring about Serbian\r\nwithdrawal from Igman and Bjelasnica - military strikes -\r\nmust also be applied in Croatia.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia is not pleased with the latest\r\nreport of the United Nations Secretary-General, which\r\nsuggests the extension of the UNPROFOR mandate in\r\nCroatia by six months, with no essential changes in respect\r\nof the present mandate. If the UNPROFOR mandate is not\r\namended within the next 48 hours to ensure energetic\r\nimplementation of the relevant resolutions and other\r\ndocuments of the Security Council, the Republic of Croatia\r\nwill be forced to renounce the United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperation on its territory and to request units to abandon\r\nCroatia not later than 30 November 1993. Maintenance of\r\nthe status quo, which is nothing but the occupation of part\r\nof Croatian territory, and the inefficiency of UNPROFOR\r\nare detrimental to the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia\r\nand to the normalization of its economic and overall life.\r\nCroatia is prepared to resolve the key problem of its\r\nexistence by all necessary means and at any cost - by\r\nnegotiated agreement and settlement if possible, but, if\r\nnecessary, by resort to legitimate means of restoring law and\r\norder, with full observance of laws governing war and\r\nhumanitarian affairs, in areas currently suffering the anarchy\r\nof Serbian terrorist and paramilitary troops.\r\nWith its involvement in the area of the former\r\nYugoslavia, UNPROFOR has borne a great burden and has\r\nsuffered considerable casualties, operating in extremely\r\ndifficult circumstances. Croatia is grateful to all\r\nUNPROFOR members who have performed their duty\r\nbravely and honourably, risking their personal safety and\r\ntheir lives, and helping thousands of suffering people.\r\nCroatia does not oppose UNPROFOR, but it can no longer\r\ntolerate the consequences of the Force’s inefficiency and its\r\npersistent circumventing of relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions. The implementation of these provisions will\r\naffect not only the existence of the Republic of Croatia but\r\nalso the basic credibility of the United Nations.\r\nBy renouncing the UNPROFOR mandate, Croatia does\r\nnot close its doors to any humanitarian action or to the\r\npossibility of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\r\noperation in the former Yugoslavia. On the contrary,\r\nCroatia welcomes the readiness of NATO to assume the role\r\nof principal guarantor of peace and stability in this part of\r\nEurope, and will actively support its units in the\r\nimplementation of the peace settlement. We also look\r\nforward to seeing NATO involved in the implementation of\r\nthe Vance plan. At the same time, Croatia’s door is being\r\nopened wide to all relief and human rights organizations,\r\nEuropean Community monitors and UNPROFOR civilian\r\nlogistic personnel engaged in the provision of relief to the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nInternational factors - I refer to the European\r\nCommunity and the United Nations - have brought the\r\nnegotiations on resolutions of the crisis in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to the settlement currently proposed. It should\r\nbe remembered that the Republic of Croatia and the Croats\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina were the first to support all\r\nserious peace plans put forward by the international\r\ncommunity. However, the indecision and inconsistency of\r\nthe international community have allowed both the Serbian\r\nand the Muslim representatives to reject or to flout these\r\nplans. Even the proclamation of independence of the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina would have been\r\nimpossible without the agreement of the Croats, expressed\r\nthrough the 1992 referendum. Without the resistance put up\r\nby the Croats, no part of Bosnia and Herzegovina would\r\nhave been defended, in the beginning, from Serbian\r\naggression. We were the first to recognize the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and the first to send an ambassador\r\nto Sarajevo. The Republic of Croatia has contributed more\r\nto the defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to the care of\r\nBosnian refugees, than have all other countries combined,\r\nand that situation continues despite the aggression waged by\r\nthe Muslim army against Croatian populated areas in central\r\nBosnia and against territory envisaged for the Croatian\r\nRepublic within the Union of Republics of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nIn view of past developments, there are no longer any\r\ncompletely equitable and clear-cut solutions to the complex\r\nBosnian crisis. If peace is to be achieved, all the parties\r\nmust accept political and territorial compromise. The Croats\r\nin Bosnia have made major concessions for the sake of\r\npeace. They have lost the most, especially in Posavina and\r\nCentral Bosnia, where the majority of the Croatian\r\npopulation used to live. They have agreed to accept\r\n18 per cent of territory although the previous Vance-Owen\r\nplan envisaged a share of about 27 per cent. Indeed, for\r\nstrategic, political and psychological reasons, the Croatian\r\nside cannot agree to any further concessions.\r\nIt should be remembered that in 1948 the Croats\r\naccounted for 23.9 per cent of the Bosnian population. That\r\nproportion declined as a result of the pressure of the\r\nhegemonistic policies of the Serbs and then of the Muslims.\r\nIn the search for a solution, the same principles must be\r\napplied throughout. One might ask, for instance, why\r\nMostar, along with Sarajevo, is being singled out for\r\nEuropean Community supervision. Why not Banja Luka and\r\nZenica or Vare, where the Croatian population is struggling\r\nfor survival?\r\nWhat about the fact that, as a result of Serbian and then\r\nMuslim aggression, two thirds of Catholic parishes in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina have been occupied or completely cleansed\r\nof the Croats who lived there for centuries? The\r\ninternational community must face facts and problems in\r\ntheir entirety. It must identify ways of halting Serbian\r\naggression, but also means of protecting the Croatian people\r\nfrom the attempts of extremists to set up a Bosnian Islamic\r\nstate, mostly at the expense of the Croats.\r\nNevertheless, I am pleased to report, here and now, that\r\nhostilities between the Croat and Serbian sides in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina have stopped and, in particular, that, on my\r\ninitiative and with the good offices of Turkey, political\r\nagreement has been reached between the Croats and the\r\nMuslims concerning the cessation of hostilities and the\r\nprovision of the prerequisites for permanent peace and\r\ncooperation.\r\nWe believe that the purpose of peace would be served\r\nby NATO’s energetic assumption of the chief role in\r\nimplementing the peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand in solving the problem of the United Nations protected\r\nareas in Croatia, with the United Nations assuming\r\nresponsibility for implementation of the peace settlement.\r\nFor geopolitical, historical and economic reasons, as\r\nwell as for the sake of transport links, the Republic of\r\nCroatia is interested in the closest future cooperation with\r\nthe Union of Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the\r\nsame token, the Republic of Croatia supports the\r\nnormalization of relations with all States that emerged\r\nfollowing the disintegration of Communist Yugoslavia, on\r\nthe basis of mutual recognition. This is not only in the\r\ninterests of the peoples of these States; it is also a\r\nprerequisite for the establishment of peace and for the\r\ncreation of a stable international order in this part of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nCroatia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Franjo Tudjman, President of the Republic of\r\nCroatia, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. ALGIRDAS MYKOLAS\r\nBRAZAUSKAS, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF\r\nLITHUANIA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Lithuania.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 13\r\nMr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, President of the\r\nRepublic of Lithuania, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Lithuania, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. ALGIRDAS MYKOLAS\r\nBRAZAUSKAS, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF\r\nLITHUANIA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Lithuania.\r\nMr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, President of the\r\nRepublic of Lithuania, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Lithuania, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident BRAZAUSKAS (spoke in Lithuanian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): Allow me to congratulate\r\nMr. Insanally on his election as President of the forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly and to wish him much\r\nsuccess in heading this august body.\r\nIt is a great honour to speak in this historic Hall, in\r\nwhich, as nowhere else, all the victories and concerns of the\r\nworld, all its problems and opportunities, are concentrated.\r\nThe voice of Lithuania, which had been muffled for half a\r\ncentury, can now be heard loud and clear throughout the\r\nworld. Lithuania, with a long tradition of statehood dating\r\nback to the thirteenth century, regained its independence\r\nthrough the determination of our people, certain fundamental\r\nchanges in the world and international support.\r\nOur State is consolidating democracy. It respects\r\nhuman and minority rights, and strives to ensure social\r\nprogress and an improved standard of living founded on free\r\nmarket principles. By participating in the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations, we\r\nhope to contribute to a better world.\r\nWe have an opportunity to voice our concerns and to\r\nobtain support not only at the United Nations, but also at the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),\r\nthe Council of Europe, the North Atlantic Cooperation\r\nCouncil and other international organizations. In\r\nestablishing friendly relations with other countries, Lithuania\r\nhas felt the supportive and increasing influence of\r\ninternational organizations in the process of democratization\r\nand in the creation of a free market economy. We trust that\r\nthe following international Conferences sponsored by the\r\nUnited Nations - the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and the Fourth World Conference on Women\r\n- will help us find lasting solutions to these concerns.\r\nSince parliamentary elections held last autumn the\r\nGovernment in Lithuania has changed. Our chosen course\r\nin foreign policy, however, in the tradition of democratic\r\nStates, has not altered. Our foreign policy priorities remain\r\nclose cooperation with the other Baltic States of Latvia and\r\nEstonia, as well as with the countries of northern Europe,\r\nand full integration into Europe’s political, economic,\r\nsecurity and cultural sphere.\r\nLithuania is seeking in particular friendly and mutually\r\nbeneficial relations with neighbouring Russia, Poland and\r\nBelarus. Lithuania supports President Boris Yeltsin’s efforts\r\nto stabilize the political situation in his country and to\r\nmaintain the course of reform. We are essentially in full\r\nagreement with the position of other democratic States\r\nregarding recent events in Russia.\r\nLike its other neighbours, Lithuania is seeking its place\r\non the new map of Europe, and we hope for closer\r\ncooperation between the countries of the Baltic Sea region.\r\nAn important aspect of such cooperation, and of Lithuania’s\r\nrelations with Russia, is our relationship with the\r\nKaliningrad region. The gradual demilitarization of that\r\nregion, the development of a free trade zone there and the\r\nincreased influence that international organizations,\r\nespecially the European Community, have on its future are\r\nin Lithuania’s best interest and, we believe, in the interests\r\nof other States in the area.\r\nIn the long term, the shores of the Baltic Sea should be\r\nfree of armaments. Measures should be taken now to\r\nincrease trust and security. Our chosen path - a gradual\r\ncoming together of the nations and States of the Baltic\r\nregion and good relations between neighbours - should lead\r\nus to the European Community and contribute to the\r\nconsolidation of security on the old continent.\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe shortest road from Paris, Berlin and Warsaw to\r\nMoscow and St. Petersburg leads through Lithuania. For\r\nmany centuries, however, the vehicles of war of attacking or\r\nretreating armies rolled across these crossroads, bringing\r\nwith them many misfortunes and tragedies. Today, however,\r\nwe hope that convoys of goods will roll across our territory.\r\nWe believe, and are working to ensure, that our complex\r\ngeopolitical situation in a new Europe - a Europe no longer\r\ntorn apart by antagonistic ideologies - should become a\r\nsource of new opportunities, benefits and prosperity. We are\r\ninspired by the example of countries such as Denmark,\r\nSwitzerland, Austria and others, which have successfully\r\ntaken advantage of similar situations and the opportunities\r\noffered by a more unified Europe.\r\nHaving restored its independence, Lithuania has once\r\nagain become a participant in the processes of a more\r\nunified Europe. Lithuania is receptive to cooperation with\r\nthe West and the East, and sees future opportunities in such\r\ncooperation.\r\nDespite the great distances that separate us, relations\r\nwith the United States have been, and will continue to be,\r\nespecially significant for Lithuania. We are grateful to the\r\nUnited States for resolutely adhering to the policy of\r\nnon-recognition of the illegal incorporation of Lithuania into\r\nthe Soviet Union. A sizeable emigré community, which\r\nfound refuge in the new world, links our two countries. We\r\nvalue close United States cooperation with Europe, including\r\nthat with the structures of the CSCE and the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization, and we sincerely wish every success for\r\nefforts to stabilize the situation in a changing world and to\r\nencourage the progress of post-Communist countries toward\r\ndemocracy and a free market.\r\nWe turn to the United Nations, asking it to safeguard\r\nthe interests of small States. The future of a more integrated\r\nworld lies in democracy and in the individuality of free\r\nnations. The international community should be prepared to\r\ndefend, with force if necessary, the sovereignty of small -\r\neven the smallest - nations. During his recent visit to\r\nLithuania, Pope John Paul II stressed that\r\n\"the interests of large States should never force small\r\nStates to become satellites of a foreign Power\".\r\nIn spite of the conflicts that now plague the world, it is\r\nfortunate that some good news also reaches this house in\r\nNew York. We welcome the peace processes in the Middle\r\nEast and the positive trends in South Africa, Cambodia,\r\nHaiti and El Salvador.\r\nOn 31 August, in compliance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 47/21 of 1992, the last remaining units of the\r\nRussian army were withdrawn from Lithuania. I should like\r\nto take this opportunity to thank representatives from all the\r\ncountries, large and small, that supported our legitimate goal.\r\nI should also like to sincerely thank the United Nations and\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who monitored the\r\nfulfilment of the obligation to withdraw that army, and who,\r\nduring the most critical moments, sent his envoy,\r\nAmbassador Tommy Koh, to Vilnius, and Mr. Stoyan\r\nGanev, President of the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly, who visited Lithuania and the other Baltic States\r\nin July to discuss the army’s withdrawal. We were glad\r\nwhen, having made it just in time for the ceremony marking\r\nthe departure of the last Russian troops, Ambassador Koh\r\nsaid:\r\n\"My work in Lithuania is done, although some work is\r\nwaiting for me in the other Baltic States.\"\r\nWhen a large State withdraws its army from a small\r\none without issuing any ultimatums or setting conditions,\r\nthis signals a new era for the world in which, thanks to\r\ninternational efforts in accordance with the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, even the most sensitive problems\r\ncan be solved peacefully. Despite several disagreements that\r\narose at the last minute, calm and balanced diplomacy\r\nallowed Lithuania and Russia to reach agreement on this\r\nfundamental question.\r\nOn more than one occasion I had the pleasure of\r\nspeaking openly and sincerely with President Boris Yeltsin\r\nof the Russian Federation. A fresh page is being turned in\r\nthe relations between our two countries. Of course, the issue\r\nof compensation for damage inflicted during the years of\r\noccupation is still on the agenda for negotiations between\r\nLithuania and Russia.\r\nThe Russian army still remains in Estonia and Latvia.\r\nWe believe that with the help of the United Nations this\r\ninternational problem will be resolved successfully and, at\r\nthe same time, the stability of the region will be bolstered.\r\nUntil people become fully aware of the possibilities that\r\ndemocracy and freedom provide these ideas will remain just\r\nthat - ideas. After an initial wave of euphoria, disillusion\r\nmay follow. One can already notice this in some post-\r\ncommunist countries. This causes me, as President of\r\nLithuania, great concern. I do not think that the world\r\ncommunity can afford to remain indifferent to this problem.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 15\r\nA democratic and civic State, based on the rule of law,\r\nin which people are not segregated according to their\r\nnationality or religious and political beliefs, is being\r\nestablished in Lithuania. There is no tension in our country\r\nbetween Lithuanians and ethnic minorities. We are\r\nreforming and stabilizing the Lithuanian economy; we are\r\nsearching for ways to provide at least minimal social welfare\r\nguarantees; as much as possible we are trying to clear the\r\nway for private initiative. We cannot, however, change our\r\neconomy overnight. The Lithuanian people are patient and\r\nindustrious, working hard for their well-being and future.\r\nHowever, disillusion with democracy and the free market\r\nwould be disastrous.\r\nTherefore I wish to speak very frankly to this body:\r\neven though we feel the concern and support of the world\r\ncommunity, that is not enough. It appears that even the\r\nmost authoritative international organizations lack the\r\ncoordinated action and initiative for truly effective\r\nassistance. We occasionally feel isolationist tendencies on\r\nthe part of the most industrialized nations; having attained a\r\nhigh standard of living, they attempt to dissociate themselves\r\nfrom the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. This\r\ngreatly complicates the future of these countries as they\r\nattempt to solve by themselves the difficult economic,\r\npolitical, psychological, cultural and historical problems that\r\nthey have inherited from the recent past. In most\r\npost-communist countries there still prevails a nostalgia for\r\nthe past, when authoritarian government guaranteed people\r\ntheir minimum needs, albeit at the expense of their freedom.\r\nWithout timely and joint efforts, this nostalgia for a\r\npseudo-socialistic past could cause the development of\r\ncertain countries to follow a course that would be\r\nunacceptable to all of us.\r\nFor several years now, both in Europe and North\r\nAmerica, the idea of a new \"Marshall Plan\" has been in the\r\nair, but it has in no way materialized. Yet investments in\r\nthe countries of Central and Eastern Europe - and I have in\r\nmind not only financial investments - would really be\r\ninvestments in all of our futures. Greater and more effective\r\nassistance for the democratic forces in post-communist States\r\nwould help decisively to rid the world of the remnants of\r\ntotalitarianism and dictatorship that have so tormented\r\nmankind in the twentieth century.\r\nWith the dissolution of two hostile blocs, the world has\r\nbecome a safer place. However, that does not solve all the\r\nsecurity problems that mankind now faces. Indeed, the\r\nnumber of such problems has increased. There is now a\r\ngreater possibility of localized conflicts: they have flared up\r\nin precisely those places where dictatorships that suppressed\r\nnations have fallen. Such horrendous practices as \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\" must be severely condemned. The model of an\r\nabsolutely closed nation-State is no longer a viable one for\r\nthe solution of separate national problems.\r\nThe Lithuanian people respect the struggle of nations\r\nfor their freedom, but they condemn atrocities which occur\r\nunder the guise of a noble cause. The tragedy of what was\r\nformerly Yugoslavia is truly horrible. We approve of the\r\nmeans that the United Nations uses to uphold peace and\r\nsecurity, but too often resolution of the structure of a State\r\nand border issues are left to warring countries to decide by\r\nforce of arms. In the future the United Nations should\r\npursue even more actively preventive diplomacy to stop\r\nconflicts before they erupt. Every illegal and violent act\r\nrequires a response, not appeasement.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s \"An Agenda for Peace\" is a\r\nwelcome plan that provides a solid foundation. What should\r\nthe new role of the United Nations be in an ever-changing\r\nworld? As I see it, in future the Organization must not only\r\nbe a guarantor of security, but also an instigator of economic\r\ndevelopment and a global defender of human and ethnic\r\nminority rights. At the Vienna Conference on Human\r\nRights, we spoke out in favour of establishing the post of\r\nhigh commissioner for human rights. At this time, ideas\r\nabout the sovereignty of States, the self-determination of\r\nnations, national security and the maintenance and\r\nenforcement of peace are changing rapidly. The individual\r\nproblems of individual States are becoming global in scope,\r\nespecially in the areas of environmental protection, refugees,\r\nnarcotics and organized crime. For precisely that reason,\r\ncooperation among neighbouring States is growing in\r\nimportance.\r\nRegional interaction is broadening and the role of\r\ninternational organizations is being extended. We approve\r\nof regional structures and arrangements that help to\r\nguarantee peace and stability in their respective regions.\r\nHowever, their activities should be linked with United\r\nNations supervision, so that large and powerful nations do\r\nnot transform such regional structures into instruments of\r\ndomination. I am referring to failed States. They need\r\ninternational assistance that would not force upon them the\r\nprotectorate of another State or provide conditions for\r\nassimilating them into some sort of sphere of influence, but\r\nwould respect and protect their sovereignty and\r\nindependence. Small countries have a right to rely on a firm\r\nguarantee of security. The United Nations could and should\r\nbecome that guarantee. In the long-term future, as\r\ndemocracy and cooperation become firmly established\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthroughout our planet, the United Nations would perhaps\r\nassume certain functions of a world government.\r\nI reiterate my support for Lithuania’s proposal, which\r\nwas outlined here at the United Nations exactly one year\r\nago, that new permanent members could be added to the\r\nSecurity Council. For the United Nations to achieve its\r\nobjective, it is important to continue and even expand the\r\nsystem reforms that are now being put into effect to increase\r\ncost-efficiency. We welcome the initiatives by several\r\ncountries, among them the United States, to establish more\r\ndependable internal and external inspection machinery. The\r\nsuggested creation of an office of inspector-general could\r\nhelp to assure Member States that the mandates that we have\r\nprovided for various programmes are put to the most\r\neffective use possible.\r\nI should like to state clearly that the current financial\r\ncrisis of the United Nations is of great concern to Lithuania.\r\nWe are not indifferent to it. Lithuania is firmly resolved to\r\nfulfil its obligations to the Organization and it has\r\ndemonstrated its readiness to do so. Lithuania could support\r\nthe activities of the Organization even more strongly if for\r\nthree years now we had not been forced repeatedly to\r\ndiscuss the difficult problem of assessments with regard to\r\nthe United Nations budget. Our delegation, along with other\r\ncountries that have found themselves in a similar situation,\r\nhas on more than one occasion suggested ways in which this\r\nproblem could be solved. I wish to emphasize that the\r\nposition of Lithuania remains unchanged. The scale of\r\nassessments must be determined on the basis of statistical\r\ndata provided by each State, in accordance with its capacity\r\nto pay and, most important, abiding by the principle that the\r\nsame methodology for calculating assessments must be\r\napplied to all States equally. In seeking to ensure these\r\nprinciples and finally to resolve this problem, we are\r\nprepared to exchange ideas with, and we hope for the\r\ncooperation of, all delegations.\r\nI reiterate my support for Lithuania’s proposal, made\r\nhere at the United Nations exactly a year ago, that new\r\npermanent members could be added to the Security Council.\r\nLithuania not only supports peace-keeping efforts, but would\r\nlike eventually to become a contributor to military and\r\ncivilian operations.\r\nWhen Lithuania became a member of the Council of\r\nEurope I suggested a meeting of all the Heads of State of\r\npost-communist countries. This would not be an attempt to\r\ncreate some sort of new bloc or to console each other about\r\nour economic hardships. Such a conference, under the\r\nauspices of the Council of Europe or perhaps some other\r\norganization, could provide an opportunity to discuss in a\r\ndown-to-earth way how to recover more quickly from the\r\nmaladies of national egoism and ethnocentricity that may be\r\nunavoidable in young States and fragile democracies. All of\r\nus in post-communist countries should, as quickly as\r\npossible, learn how to cooperate among ourselves and with\r\nthe rest of the world and strive to be better full-fledged\r\nmembers of our planet’s democratic community. Other\r\ncountries have learned the art of cooperation over decades.\r\nWe have not had that much time. It is very important that\r\nwe succeed through a joint effort in making this period as\r\nbrief as possible.\r\nWe welcome the initiative by some Members of the\r\nUnited Nations to establish a forum for new and restored\r\ndemocracies. It is our sincere hope that this movement,\r\nbegun in the Philippines, will help bring developing\r\ncountries and countries in transition closer together, so that\r\nthey may reach common approaches down the path to\r\ndemocracy and a free market.\r\nThe spirit of the approaching twenty-first century\r\nalready fills this Hall. At the turn of the third millennium\r\nmankind is faced with critical global problems that threaten\r\nits very existence: ecological, social and spiritual problems\r\nand the nuclear threat, which has not yet been abolished.\r\nNational and regional problems seem to pale in comparison,\r\nbut I do not think that that is really the case. Every step\r\ntowards progress, even if taken in a small country or with\r\nregard to improved relations between two States, diminishes\r\nthe possibility of global conflict, and vice versa. I should\r\ntherefore like to believe that the withdrawal of the Russian\r\nmilitary from Lithuania was an achievement for more than\r\njust two countries. The entire world became somewhat\r\nbetter, somewhat more just, and the threat that hung over it\r\nwas abated.\r\nI think that there will be more and more such successes.\r\nThe United Nations system contributes, and will continue to\r\ncontribute, significantly to their attainment.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, I\r\nwish to thank the President of the Republic of Lithuania for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, President of the\r\nRepublic of Lithuania, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 17\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMrs. UGGLAS (Sweden): Let me express the Swedish\r\nGovernment’s satisfaction at the election of Ambassador\r\nInsanally of Guyana as President of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I should also like to pay a tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General and to his endeavours to promote the\r\nprinciples of the Charter and a stronger United Nations.\r\nFurthermore, I welcome the six new Members of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe totalitarian ideologies of this century have been\r\ndefeated, but the struggle of ideas is not over. Totalitarian\r\nideas and ideologies can take on different shapes at different\r\ntimes. In many places - and no country is immune - we still\r\nwitness expressions of racism, xenophobia and intolerance.\r\nIf these tendencies are not effectively countered today, the\r\nworld might have to face far uglier threats tomorrow.\r\nAs we welcome the progress towards peace and\r\nfreedom in Eastern Europe, in the Middle East and in South\r\nAfrica, we have to realize that these achievements will prove\r\nelusive if they do not give people a better life. Peace and\r\ndemocracy, freedom and reconciliation, must be cemented by\r\neconomic and social progress.\r\nThe individual’s endeavours to improve his own lot and\r\nthat of his family reflect a basic human desire, which\r\ntranscends all cultural differences. If that desire is\r\nhampered, if hope turns into disillusion, a fertile ground is\r\ncreated for the merchants of hatred and preachers of\r\nviolence.\r\nThe regions of the world where security and prosperity\r\nhave been relatively well secured now have opportunities to\r\nhelp extend the zone of peace to areas that are struggling to\r\nescape the vicious circle of poverty and violence. The main\r\ninstruments for such developments are freer global trade and\r\na more open exchange of ideas.\r\nIn Europe, the evolving European union, of which\r\nSweden soon hopes to become a member, has a special\r\nresponsibility for ensuring that the Iron Curtain is not\r\nreinstalled in the form of persistent economic and social\r\ndivisions. The United States and Asia-Pacific countries are\r\nmeeting challenges of a similar nature in their regions. In\r\nthe Middle East and Africa, we all share a joint\r\nresponsibility.\r\nIn spite of all the challenges facing the world today -\r\nregional conflicts, widespread poverty, environmental\r\ndamage and arms proliferation - I believe we have a\r\nreasonable chance of extending the zone of peace and\r\nprosperity as we stand at the threshold of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. In this effort we must be able to rely on a strong\r\nand efficient world Organization.\r\nToday the United Nations is reaching middle age. In\r\ntwo years it will be celebrating its fiftieth anniversary. The\r\nend of the cold war brings new opportunities to utilize the\r\nfull potential of the United Nations Charter and the United\r\nNations system. At the same time, a thorough diagnosis and\r\nsome strong prescriptions are necessary if the Organization\r\nis to serve as a vigorous instrument of the world community.\r\nFormer Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold once\r\nsaid:\r\n\"The United Nations is, and should be, a living,\r\nevolving, experimental institution. If it should ever\r\ncease to be so, it should be revolutionized or swept\r\naside for a new approach.\"\r\nThose words are as challenging and valid today as they were\r\nin the late 1950s.\r\nToday, I do not intend to dwell on those areas in which\r\nthe Organization works well, or to commend praiseworthy\r\ninitiatives. Instead, I would like to concentrate on areas\r\nwhere reforms and a special focus are indispensable. The\r\nmost important of these are the promotion of peace and\r\nsecurity, the role of the Organization in the economic and\r\nsocial fields, and the promotion of human rights.\r\nIn responding to several crises in the aftermath of the\r\ncold war, the Security Council has, de facto, considerably\r\nbroadened the concept of international peace and security.\r\nThe United Nations finds itself engaged on a regular basis\r\nin wide-ranging and diversified operations in a variety of\r\ncomplex conflict situations. Some of these are of an internal\r\nnature and many of them involve humanitarian efforts. The\r\nvery concept of United Nations peace-keeping has undergone\r\ndramatic change.\r\nUnprecedented demands are being placed on the\r\nOrganization in the quest for global security and peace.\r\nThere has been an eight-fold increase in the number of\r\npeople serving in peace-keeping operations during the past\r\ntwo years; the peace-keeping budget will more than double\r\nin the course of a single year.\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe implementation of a peace agreement in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina will require additional and substantial\r\ncontributions from United Nations Member States. Again\r\nthe willingness and ability to provide personnel and\r\nresources will be tested. I am pleased to announce that at\r\nthis very moment a Nordic battalion group is being deployed\r\nin Bosnia.\r\nAs much as we welcome a peace settlement for Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina we must recognize that it is far from an\r\nideal solution to that long and bitter conflict. It might\r\nconstitute no more than the beginning of a complicated and\r\nfrustrating process towards peace where all efforts must be\r\nused to counter the inherent dangers of continued aggression,\r\n\"ethnic cleansing\" and the dismemberment of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nAs soon as a settlement has been signed by the parties,\r\nwe should concentrate on building a peace which can\r\nprovide safe and decent conditions for the suffering\r\npopulation. First of all, we need a strong and efficient\r\npeace-keeping operation in order to assist in implementing\r\nthe provisions of the agreement.\r\nInternational organizations, particularly the United\r\nNations, must embark on a comprehensive reconstruction\r\nand rehabilitation programme. Special attention should be\r\npaid to the situation of refugees and displaced persons, and\r\nto their return, and to the plight of women and children.\r\nExperience gained from the conflict in former\r\nYugoslavia and from the successful United Nations\r\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) shows the\r\nneed for an integrated approach to international peace and\r\nsecurity. This must be one of the guiding principles for\r\nreforming and restructuring the Organization to enable it to\r\ndeal more effectively with today’s conflicts. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report \"An Agenda for Peace\" indicates\r\nways to improve the medium-term and long-term handling\r\nof peace-keeping. An interaction between preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict\r\npeace-building is indispensable.\r\nThe need for reform in the peace-keeping area is\r\nundisputed. Ongoing efforts in this regard are commendable\r\nand should be further promoted. The Nordic countries\r\nintend to present proposals on this issue during the current\r\nGeneral Assembly session. At this early stage I would like\r\nto stress the following points.\r\nFirst, we should be able to react flexibly to dynamic\r\nsituations in peace-keeping operations, and that requires\r\nbetter provisions for planning and operations staff.\r\nCommand and control need to be clearly defined. The\r\noperative command of operations in the field would, of\r\ncourse, remain in the hands of the respective force\r\ncommanders.\r\nSecondly, close consultations between the troop\r\ncontributors, the Security Council and the Secretary-General\r\nare of special importance in complex peace-keeping\r\noperations. A forum for coordination and exchange of\r\ninformation to improve contacts between the Council and the\r\ntroop contributors would be desirable. I propose that such\r\na forum be set up for each major operation.\r\nThirdly, we urge Member States to respond positively\r\nto the Secretary-General’s request, and provide troops, other\r\npersonnel and equipment on a stand-by basis for use at short\r\nnotice for peace-keeping purposes. The members of the\r\nSecurity Council hold a special responsibility to ensure that\r\nadequate resources are provided when it decides on new\r\noperations.\r\nFourthly, peace-keeping operations and humanitarian\r\nrelief efforts are increasingly interrelated, and this requires\r\nimproved coordination. In many cases the humanitarian\r\nefforts are vital for the successful pursuance of\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nFifthly, the great number of peace-keeping operations\r\nand their diversity require special emphasis on training. To\r\naddress the need for appropriate training of United Nations\r\npeace-keepers, United Nations training colleges should be\r\nestablished. The United Nations has an important role to\r\nplay in coordinating and promoting peace-keeping training\r\nfor all categories of personnel. Member States with\r\nlong-standing traditions in this field bear a special\r\nresponsibility. Sweden, for its part, is prepared to contribute\r\nto improving the skills of peace-keepers. This could include\r\ntraining for civilian and humanitarian-relief personnel, and\r\nalso for police and military staff.\r\nFinally, and most important, present and increasing\r\ndemands on United Nations peace-keeping cannot be met if\r\nMember States do not pay their dues. We must create the\r\nnecessary resources for the rapid implementation of Security\r\nCouncil decisions. If not, we run the risk of undermining\r\nthe credibility and the prestige of the United Nations and the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nNew threats to regional security are emerging.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\narrangements is vital to meet these threats of global\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 19\r\nimportance. Regional action is indispensable to strengthen\r\nthe global community of values and to secure the efficient\r\nuse of scarce resources. In this spirit, the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) is applying for\r\nObserver status in the General Assembly.\r\nAs Chairman of the CSCE Council, I signed in May a\r\nframework document with the Secretary-General. This\r\nframework aims at improving coordination and cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the CSCE in conflict\r\nresolution in the CSCE area. The implementation of that\r\nframework is essential for realizing the goals of Chapter VIII\r\nof the Charter. Regular consultations, mutual exchange of\r\ninformation and coordination of activities between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE have started. CSCE missions are\r\nsupervising the implementation of United Nations sanctions\r\nagainst the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and\r\nMontenegro). Concrete action in the field is also taking\r\nplace in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in\r\nunfortunate Georgia.\r\nAs Chairman of the CSCE I deplore the recent\r\ndevelopments in Georgia. The very survival of Georgia as\r\na member of the international community is now at stake.\r\nThe CSCE lends its full support to President Shevardnadze’s\r\nefforts to prevent the dismemberment of his country. All\r\nparticipating States must now exert their influence to that\r\nend. The disintegration of Georgia is in no one’s interest.\r\nThe Security Council bears primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, and\r\nmust be the driving force behind reforms in this area,\r\nreflecting the aspirations of the States Members of the\r\nOrganization. In this context, we welcome the statement by\r\nthe Council that progress in disarmament, arms control and\r\nnon-proliferation can make a crucial contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security. An early agreement on\r\na comprehensive test ban would enhance that concept.\r\nThe considerable increase in the number of Members of\r\nthe United Nations makes an enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil a matter for urgent consideration. The effectiveness,\r\nefficiency and legitimacy of the Council must be the\r\noverriding goals. A reform must ensure that the Council\r\ncontinues to be relevant in a changing world and that it\r\nretains its capacity to act decisively and promptly.\r\nThe United Nations has a unique mandate to promote\r\neconomic, social and environmental progress and\r\ndevelopment. Increased attention should be given to these\r\nareas to overcome long-term threats to international peace\r\nand security. Today, the challenge for the United Nations is\r\nto fulfil its important role in supporting international\r\ncooperation and governments’ efforts to master the\r\nincreasingly complex problems of development. Sweden is\r\nlooking forward to contributing to the deliberations on the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on an agenda for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAlong with other countries, we have witnessed with\r\nincreasing concern what seems to be a fragmentation and\r\nmarginalization of the United Nations in development\r\nassistance, not least in long-term development. It is obvious\r\nthat extensive reform is needed if the United Nations is to be\r\nable to respond to the new challenges.\r\nA more efficient governance structure and a broader,\r\nmore stable and predictable funding of operational activities\r\nare in the interest both of recipient and of donor countries.\r\nWe must sharpen our instruments, both in terms of policy\r\nformulation and development action, to avoid having interest,\r\ncommitment and funding from Sweden and other Member\r\nStates diverted to other organizations, to the detriment of\r\nthose most in need of what the United Nations could offer.\r\nAs a long-standing, major donor, with a firm belief in\r\nthe importance of the United Nations in the economic and\r\nsocial fields, Sweden will continue to work for much-needed\r\nreforms. Against this background, we hope that the recent\r\ndecision to continue negotiations on the role, size and\r\nfunctioning of the executive boards of the development\r\nprogrammes will lead to a result that ensures an effective\r\nconduct of work in the development field. The executive\r\nboards must be efficient instruments, capable of firmly\r\nguiding the work of their respective organizations.\r\nThe promotion of human rights is a United Nations\r\npriority objective, as set out in the Charter. Thus, the\r\nprotection and promotion of human rights should underpin\r\nthe whole spectrum of United Nations activities.\r\nFlagrant abuse of human rights and humanitarian law\r\nis still a tragic reality for millions of people in many parts\r\nof the world. At the World Conference on Human Rights,\r\nall States reaffirmed their solemn commitment to promote\r\nrespect for and protection of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, the universal nature of which is beyond question.\r\nSuch commitments are, however, of no avail if they are not\r\nput into action. All States have a duty to adhere to the\r\ninternational conventions in this field.\r\nWe must also make sure that the United Nations human\r\nrights programme is allocated the means and support\r\nnecessary to fulfil its role. We should, as a matter of\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nurgency, take steps to increase the resources and improve the\r\nfunction of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights.\r\nThe establishment of a high commissioner for human\r\nrights would enhance the capacity of the international system\r\nto deal more directly with emergencies and grave violations.\r\nIt would help to improve coordination and integration of\r\nhuman rights within the United Nations system as a whole.\r\nThe commissioner would personify the priority given to the\r\nprotection of human rights, and this issue should be a matter\r\nfor prompt consideration by this General Assembly.\r\nSweden welcomes the fact that the General Assembly\r\nrecently proceeded to select the judges for the Tribunal\r\nestablished for prosecuting war crimes committed in former\r\nYugoslavia. This means that the Tribunal can shortly\r\ncommence its important work.\r\nLet me revert to the United Nations financial crisis. It\r\nis deeply disturbing that 90 per cent of the assessed\r\ncontributions are paid late or not at all. There is no\r\njustification for the failure of permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council to live up to their obligations in this\r\nrespect.\r\nThe time has come to address the issue of incentives\r\nand penalties to enhance the principle of meeting financial\r\nobligations on time and in full. The recommendations of the\r\nIndependent Advisory Group on United Nations Financing\r\nin this respect must receive immediate attention. In this\r\nconnection, let us not forget the letter and the spirit of\r\nArticle 19 of the Charter, with its implications for the right\r\nto vote.\r\nAn adjustment of the scale of assessments must ensure\r\na fairer and more up-to-date application of the principle of\r\ncapacity to pay.\r\nAt a time of resource constraints, it is also imperative\r\nfor Member States to face the questions of priorities and\r\nefficient management. Strict budgetary discipline is\r\nrequired, and scarce resources should not be wasted on\r\nactivities lacking well-defined goals: the means entrusted to\r\nthe Organization must be used in the most cost-effective and\r\nprudent manner. We welcome the recent measures taken by\r\nthe Secretary-General in this regard.\r\nWe now have a unique opportunity to strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation. This window of opportunity is\r\ngreater than at any time since 1945. The judgement of\r\nhistory will be harsh if we fail to grasp this moment.\r\nTherefore, it is up to us, as politicians and statesmen of the\r\npresent generation, to make sure that international\r\ncooperation takes a decisive step forward.\r\nThe United Nations has a central role in this process.\r\nIf the United Nations concentrates on the essential tasks\r\nentrusted to it in the Charter, and manages to generate the\r\nnecessary support and cooperation, this can be achieved.\r\nThere is broad consensus among the Member States about\r\nthe need to strengthen the United Nations. If this consensus\r\ncan be transformed into rapid action, we will have made\r\nconsiderable progress in making the world Organization\r\nfulfil the high expectations attached to it today.\r\nMr. MELESCANU (Romania) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): There can be no doubt that today \"transition\" is\r\nthe key word that defines the process that my country, along\r\nwith others, is undergoing. The inclusion in the agenda of\r\nthe General Assembly of an item on countries in transition\r\nexemplifies the Assembly’s capacity to respond swiftly to\r\nthe concerns of its members.\r\nLast year, my predecessor stressed to the General\r\nAssembly the importance of Romanian society’s capacity to\r\nlearn. Since then, my country has continued to learn that\r\ndemocracy, the rule of law, political pluralism, a market\r\neconomy, and respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms are necessary conditions for individual potential\r\nand aspirations to be fulfilled.\r\nWe have also learned that the transition will last longer\r\nthan expected, that the challenges it presents are greater than\r\nwe imagined and that its social costs are heavier than we\r\nfirst estimated. However, these bitter lessons do not in any\r\nway dissuade us from our irreversible choice: democracy\r\nand a market economy.\r\nAs the Assembly may know, during 1992 free and fair\r\nlocal, general and presidential elections took place in\r\nRomania. The first stage of restructuring the political life\r\nand strengthening the rule of law has thus been completed.\r\nClearly, the political process is still undergoing changes.\r\nEleven parties are now represented in Parliament. Moreover,\r\na special provision of our electoral law guarantees a seat in\r\nthe legislature for each national minority, even if their\r\npolitical organizations did not obtain the required minimum\r\nof votes. At the same time, there is a slow but steady trend\r\ntowards a clearer shaping of political diversity into stronger\r\nand better defined political forces.\r\nAs for economic restructuring, in March 1993 the\r\nGovernment formed after the general elections presented its\r\nstrategy for economic and social reform to the Romanian\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 21\r\nParliament. The central idea of this strategy is that the\r\ntransition to a market economy should be as fast as possible.\r\nWhile focusing on privatization and structural changes, at\r\nboth the macro-economic and micro-economic levels, the\r\nGovernment also pays particular attention to their social\r\ncosts.\r\nThis year we have taken some decisive steps. On 1\r\nMay the Government ended all subsidies for the production\r\nof consumer goods and as of 1 July the value added tax\r\nbecame the sole fiscal instrument.\r\nWe already note a growing interest on the part of some\r\nmajor Western companies in investing in and cooperating\r\nwith viable Romanian companies. This augurs well for the\r\nstimulation of economic activity.\r\nHowever, our economy still faces some major\r\ndifficulties, inherent in the transition period. At the same\r\ntime, unfavourable external circumstances have during the\r\nlast three years triggered a dramatic fall in the output of\r\nimportant economic sectors. They include the reduction in\r\neconomic cooperation with neighbouring countries and the\r\nadverse effects of the successive United Nations embargoes\r\nimposed on Iraq, Libya and the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, all strictly observed by Romania.\r\nOur experience over recent years has shown that\r\ninternal efforts can be decisively catalyzed by foreign\r\nassistance, both financial and managerial. Therefore, we\r\nbelieve that international assistance in the next few years\r\ncould speed up our reform process and boost industrial\r\nproduction, while improving the Romanian economy’s\r\nintegration into the world economy.\r\nTo sum up, we can state at this juncture that the\r\nessential lesson we have drawn from this period of transition\r\nis that - in spite of undeniable difficulties - there is no\r\nturning back. We shall respect and follow the irreversible\r\nchoice of the Romanian people to join the family of\r\ndemocratic nations.\r\nIn our view, democracy and the new role of the United\r\nNations are not only complementary, but mutually\r\nstrengthening. In this respect, I should like to quote\r\nPresident Woodrow Wilson in his Address to the United\r\nStates Congress on 2 April 1917, as follows:\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n\"A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained\r\nexcept by a partnership of democratic nations. No\r\nautocratic Government could be trusted to keep faith\r\nwithin it or observe its covenant. It must be a league\r\nof honour, a partnership of opinions\".\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThese ideas are still valid, and constitute precisely the\r\nobjective we must strive for, devoting all our efforts to\r\nstrengthening and giving new substance to the role of the\r\nUnited Nations. While remaining loyal to its basic\r\nprinciples and goals, the Organization must naturally adapt\r\nto the new political climate. Deeply and sincerely\r\ncommitted to the spirit of the United Nations Charter,\r\nRomania intends to support fully the ideas and\r\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s report\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\". In so doing, my country regards\r\nthe United Nations, as described in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the United Nations,\r\n\"as the instrument of the body of Member States,\r\nand ... as more than the sum of its parts.\" (A/48/1,\r\npara. 512)\r\nMindful that implementing the lofty ideals of the United\r\nNations requires adequate resources, we are ready to support\r\nfully every effort to make better use of resources, with the\r\ncontributing nations having stricter control. Firm measures\r\nare needed. Accountability must become the watchword\r\nboth for the Organization’s daily work and for its future\r\nprojects.\r\nEnlargement and diversification of programmes for\r\neconomic and social development and for protection of the\r\nenvironment are imperative. It is, however, important to\r\nmake sure that money allocated to these programmes is not\r\nwasted on piles of paper and unnecessary travels around the\r\nworld.\r\nPeace-keeping operations, which have undergone such\r\nan impressive expansion in recent years, have similar\r\nrequirements. Increased attention should be given to the\r\nratio of costs to benefits and control of the use of resources.\r\nThe new political climate, which has brought an\r\nenhanced role for the Security Council, has made possible a\r\nmore effective use of the United Nations potential for\r\ncontrolling and resolving conflicts.\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nRomania is determined to contribute to the best of its\r\nability to United Nations peace-keeping operations, and to\r\nthis end has already started a special programme to increase\r\nits capacity to respond adequately to the requirements of the\r\nOrganization or of other institutions. A first battalion of\r\nprofessional military personnel is already being trained for\r\nsuch operations; we estimate that it could become\r\noperational at the beginning of next spring.\r\nGiven the need to enhance the capacity of the United\r\nNations in this dynamic exercise of its functions, the support\r\nand cooperation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\nand the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe\r\nare all the more needed and welcomed. In this regard, the\r\ncontributions of other regional agreements and organizations,\r\nand particularly the praiseworthy work carried out by the\r\nNorth Atlantic Cooperation Council, are of great importance.\r\nAt the same time, in order to preserve the prestige and\r\ncredibility of peacekeeping operations and to ensure the\r\nconfidence of the international community, such operations\r\nmust strictly observe the principles and premises which have\r\ncontributed to their success thus far. Therefore, we must be\r\ncautious in granting any unilateral authority that some\r\ncountries might be tempted to assume in areas where they\r\nhave special interests. This applies especially when there are\r\ndoubts about the impartiality of forces involved, or when the\r\nnecessary consent of the host country may be prejudiced by\r\nany kind of pressure.\r\nWisdom and caution are all the more necessary in this\r\nrespect, since we recognize the United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations as an important dimension of a\r\nfuture new world order.\r\nHuman beings and their creative potential must always\r\nremain the central focus of all our endeavours. We welcome\r\nthe encouraging results of the World Conference on Human\r\nRights, and we hope that these conclusions, including those\r\nconcerning the creation of a post of High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights, will be implemented as soon as possible.\r\nWe also hope that the World Summit on Social\r\nDevelopment, to be held in 1995, will be even more\r\nsuccessful.\r\nI am very pleased to reaffirm that respect for the human\r\nperson has become a generally accepted norm in our strategy\r\nfor social development. Romania is now a party to almost\r\nall the major international agreements on human rights and\r\nis engaged with all openness in the relevant international\r\nprocedures.\r\nInternational commitments to uphold human rights and\r\nthe rule of law are closely linked to national legislation\r\nthrough a constitutional clause that enshrines the primacy of\r\ninternational regulations over domestic law. The admission\r\nof Romania as a member of the Council of Europe, as was\r\nrecommended earlier today by an overwhelming majority in\r\nthe Council’s parliamentary assembly, will complete this\r\npicture. In short, international standards and norms are at\r\nthe same time our standards and norms.\r\nCertainly, progress, particularly in the field of human\r\nrights, is not just a matter of drafting and passing new laws\r\nand regulations: it is also a matter of their implementation\r\nin a social environment. No less important is the economic\r\naspect. Standards of living and quality of life have a\r\nconsiderable impact on human rights. That is why we are\r\nstriving to make social protection a basic dimension of our\r\nreform programme.\r\nThe protection of the rights of people belonging to\r\nethnic minorities is an integral part of the protection of\r\nhuman rights. In Romania there are 14 national and ethnic\r\nminorities registered as such through their political parties or\r\norganizations. All together they represent about 10 per cent\r\nof the population. Since 1989 we have been making steady\r\nefforts to institute measures to protect the rights of persons\r\nbelonging to national minorities.\r\nThe establishment this year of the National Council of\r\nMinorities broadened the institutional framework, enabling\r\neach and every national minority in Romania to take part in\r\nthe decision-making process regarding the protection of their\r\nethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity. It is true\r\nthat we have not responded completely to all their demands\r\nand aspirations. The explanation for this lies, not in a lack\r\nof will, but in the difficulties confronting the entire\r\npopulation.\r\nYet we would underline that the excessive use of\r\nminority-related issues is harmful to the interests of\r\nminorities themselves, those of the majority of the\r\npopulation, and those of the international community as a\r\nwhole. Unfortunately, such tendencies, expressing\r\naggressive nationalism as well as xenophobia, racism and\r\nanti-Semitism, are still significant destabilizing factors and\r\na threat to international peace and security in Eastern and\r\nCentral Europe as elsewhere. Caution is therefore needed in\r\ndealing with these phenomena, as well as with the so-called\r\nnew concept of the right to self-determination, in order to\r\nprevent any debasement of its legal content.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 23\r\nThe Romanian delegation would like to avail itself of\r\nthis opportunity to reaffirm its great satisfaction over the\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian declaration of principles on Palestinian\r\nself-rule in Gaza and Jericho, signed on 13 September 1993\r\nin Washington, D.C. In the view of the Romanian\r\nGovernment, their mutual recognition and the declaration of\r\nprinciples represent a triumph of the reason and political will\r\nof both the Israeli Government and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization, thus opening up new possibilities for peaceful\r\ncoexistence and collaboration, not only between their two\r\npeoples, but among all the peoples in the region. The lion’s\r\nshare of the credit certainly goes to the two parties directly\r\ninvolved, but we cannot overlook the contribution of the\r\ninternational community, of the United States Government,\r\nand of the Governments of other countries. In this\r\nconnection, I am very pleased to recall the constant efforts\r\ndeployed by my country for peace and understanding\r\nbetween the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.\r\nWith regard to the conflict in the eastern region of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova, the conclusions expressed last year by\r\nthe Romanian delegation are, unfortunately, still valid in\r\nlarge part. No progress whatsoever has been made towards\r\nthe political solution of the conflict. Moreover, we are\r\nwitnessing a strange situation in which the commander-in-\r\nchief of the 14th Russian army - a foreign army on the\r\nnational soil of an independent country without the consent\r\nof that United Nations Member - was recently \"elected\" as\r\na member of the so-called local parliament.\r\nIn our opinion, the withdrawal of foreign troops is the\r\nkey to the solution of the conflict in the Transdniestr area.\r\nWe note with full satisfaction that a similar viewpoint is\r\nshared by the international community. A resolute\r\naffirmation of this position at the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly would be instrumental in upholding the\r\nindependence and territorial integrity of the Republic of\r\nMoldova. The recent positive developments on the\r\nwithdrawal of the Russian troops from the Baltic countries,\r\nan item which is to be debated at the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, could serve as a useful precedent.\r\nWithin the same framework we should like to\r\nacknowledge the efforts of the mission of the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and to assure it\r\nof our full support for the accomplishment of its tasks. We\r\nfavour the resumption of the quadripartite mechanism of\r\nmeetings between the Ministers of Foreign Affairs from the\r\nRepublic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation and\r\nUkraine.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova needs both the understanding\r\nand the support of the international community. A very\r\npromising sign in this respect is the prompt international\r\nreaction to the so-called trial in Tiraspol, where a group of\r\npersons was detained for political reasons by the\r\nself-proclaimed authorities of Transdniestr. Their lives are\r\nstill in danger. This trial reveals the political nature of the\r\nconflict in the Republic of Moldova.\r\nDespite the energetic diplomatic efforts made to date,\r\nthe conflicts in the former Yugoslavia are far from being\r\nresolved. As a neighbour and friend to all the successor\r\nStates, Romania is genuinely interested to see the earliest\r\npossible resumption of normal life in that region. Putting an\r\nend to the sufferings of the people and to the continual life-\r\nthreatening risks to the lives of the members of the United\r\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) is an immediate\r\nimperative.\r\nRomania reiterates its great appreciation of the constant\r\nefforts deployed by the two Co-Chairmen of the Peace\r\nConference on Yugoslavia. In this context we should stress\r\nthe Romanian Government’s commitment to continuing its\r\nefforts for a peaceful settlement of the Yugoslav conflict and\r\nits support for the peace process co-sponsored by the United\r\nNations and the European Community.\r\nConvinced that a negotiated peace is the only\r\nacceptable solution to the conflict, Romania will add its\r\ndiplomatic efforts to those of other countries in the region.\r\nThe success of our joint efforts is vital for the new Europe\r\nwe wish to build and for the future stability of the region.\r\nIn the context of the Yugoslav crisis, Romania complies\r\nstrictly with the sanctions regime imposed by the relevant\r\nSecurity Council’s resolutions. Despite painful effects on\r\nour economy in the midst of a period of crisis and transition,\r\nwe consider these measures a necessary means of supporting\r\nthe peace-seeking efforts.\r\nThe presence of European Economic Community and\r\nCSCE sanctions assistance missions and of a small Western\r\nEuropean Union fleet that is patrolling the Romanian sector\r\nof the river has tightened the already-existing monitoring\r\nmechanisms. We have also engaged in close coordination\r\nwith the other riparian countries.\r\nNotwithstanding these efforts, we have not received\r\nsuitable compensation to defray our tremendous economic\r\nlosses. We are certainly encouraged by the increasing\r\nawareness on the part of the international community and the\r\nSecurity Council, in the spirit of Article 50 of the United\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nNations Charter, with respect to the difficulties being\r\nexperienced by Romania and other affected countries. We\r\nshould like, however, to see this spirit given material form.\r\nThe United Nations bodies and international financial\r\ninstitutions should respond to the needs of our countries\r\nrather than leave us to fend for ourselves in seeking\r\nsolutions to the burdensome difficulties we face as a result\r\nof acting as loyal Members of the United Nations.\r\nWe welcome the serious debate in various United\r\nNations bodies on the issue of compensations. The\r\nrecommendations adopted by the Committee of the Security\r\nCouncil established under resolution 724 (1991) express\r\ngenuine moral support and solidarity. Unfortunately, we\r\nmust accept the fact that moral support is not enough; we\r\ncannot face serious economic needs with nothing more than\r\nfine words. We await strengthened consultative mechanisms\r\nfor considering concrete solutions to these problems, and we\r\nhope that the international financial institutions will be more\r\nreceptive.\r\nThis would bring well-deserved assistance to the\r\naffected countries, while at the same time increasing\r\nconfidence in the authority of the United Nations Charter\r\nand its ability to preserve the dedication of countries to the\r\ncause of peace.\r\nWe believe that the end of the cold war will result in\r\nnew general and specific duties for the members of the\r\ninternational community. If our common goals as Members\r\nof the United Nations are democracy, peace and security,\r\nthen solidarity is an essential means of achieving those\r\ngoals. One of the most original contributions the United\r\nNations could make during the current United Nations\r\nDecade of International Law would be to define the legal\r\ncontent of the \"duty of solidarity\" which should be\r\nimplemented in consonance with the universally accepted\r\nprinciples of jus gentium, democracy and human rights. In\r\nour view solidarity should become one of the central\r\nstrategic values of the new world order.\r\nUndoubtedly we still live in a time of great challenges\r\nfor the world community and the United Nations. Though\r\nit is true that many of the great expectations raised by the\r\nend of the cold war have not yet been fulfilled, we should\r\nnot give up hope. The best way to turn hope into reality is\r\nto work together, leaving both unfruitful habits and selfish\r\nconsiderations behind us. Our joint efforts must, above all,\r\nbe an expression of a vital, powerful solidarity and of\r\nconfidence in what we can do together for a better\r\ntomorrow.\r\nMr. DI TELLA (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I congratulate Ambassador Insanally on his\r\nelection. I have no doubt that he will conduct our work in\r\na wise and balanced manner, in the same way as his\r\npredecessor, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBulgaria, Mr. Ganev.\r\nOnce again, we welcome the new Member States, the\r\nCzech Republic, the Slovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Monaco, Eritrea and Andorra.\r\nWe also reiterate our gratitude to and support for the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, who with clear\r\nobjectives and diplomatic efficiency has undertaken the new\r\ntasks of the United Nations in an international climate that\r\nis problematic but promising.\r\nSerious conflicts, such as that in the former Yugoslavia\r\nand the sensitive situation in Somalia, still remain, and are\r\nthe object of the work and efforts of the United Nations.\r\nThere are long-standing regional confrontations and frictions\r\nresulting from certain national, cultural or religious\r\nidentities; ignored for long periods, they are now demanding\r\ntheir rights, and not always in a peaceful manner.\r\nMoreover, there are still sharp economic imbalances\r\nbetween nations and regions, as well as the serious risk that\r\nthe Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\r\nTrade (GATT) negotiations will fail because some\r\nGovernments insist on maintaining anachronistic protectionist\r\npolicies that adversely affect the trade opportunities of\r\ncountries such as Argentina.\r\nAbove and beyond these problems, this is also a time\r\nof hope and optimism; we are heartened by the expansion of\r\ndemocracy, the globalization of the concept of human rights,\r\nand the economic openness and reform in regions where\r\nstate control once prevailed and where today the basis for\r\nfreedom and the continual quest for peace is growing.\r\nPerhaps there is no better symbol of this hope and\r\noptimism than the historic agreement between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization.\r\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict has until now been one of the\r\nmore disturbing issues in contemporary history and one of\r\nthe greatest obstacles to peace and stability. The\r\nconsequences of this prolonged and painful confrontation\r\nhave been felt everywhere; hence all humankind rejoices at\r\nthe agreements that have been reached.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 25\r\nThese agreements undoubtedly reflect the tenacious and\r\nintelligent diplomacy of the parties, the special contribution\r\nof Governments such as those of the United States, the\r\nRussian Federation and Norway and the support of the\r\nmembers of the Security Council; but, above all, they attest\r\nto the courage, intelligence and maturity of the peoples and\r\nleaders of Israel and Palestine. Today we wish to pay a\r\ntribute to all of them.\r\nSince its origin, the conflict in the Middle East has\r\nbeen of particular concern to Argentina, inter alia, because\r\nthe Arab and Jewish communities in our country have\r\nalways coexisted peacefully. That is why we have always\r\nhoped for peace and respected the need to avoid\r\nconfrontation and achieve a just and lasting solution taking\r\naccount of the interests of both parties.\r\nThe agreements reached can be considered as a\r\nbreakthrough in that direction. They open the door to a\r\nglobal settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and that is why\r\nwe rejoice at their attainment and firmly support them. We\r\ncall upon all States, particularly those which have interests\r\nor influence in the Middle East, to join resolutely in the\r\nsupport that the circumstances require.\r\nThe Republic of Argentina considers the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security as essential. Hence, my\r\nGovernment considers that the efficient functioning of the\r\nSecurity Council must be a priority for the Organization.\r\nArgentina has therefore clearly defined its position on\r\nan eventual restructuring of the Security Council. In our\r\nopinion, that body has recovered the role assigned to it by\r\nthe Charter. Any changes in its structure should therefore be\r\nmade solely on the basis of consensus, always respecting the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States, and taking care\r\nnot to endanger its ability to fulfil effectively the\r\nresponsibilities assigned to it by the Charter. Hence we\r\nmust act with the utmost prudence, and on the basis of the\r\naforementioned principle, in making changes that would\r\nintroduce structural modifications, creating, for example, new\r\ncategories of privilege. In any case, it would be counter-\r\nproductive to ignore the position of those countries that have\r\nactively demonstrated their firm and continued support for\r\nthe Council’s important work.\r\nMr. Bull (Liberia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nArgentina, for example, resolutely and actively supports\r\nthe system of collective security provided for in the Charter\r\nand the decisions of the Security Council. That support has\r\nbeen repeatedly demonstrated through concrete action in\r\naccordance with Council decisions, and in particular through\r\nour active presence in peace-keeping operations.\r\nAt present, Argentina is participating in nine\r\npeace-keeping operations; in the last few months alone, we\r\nhave pledged to send three new groups of our armed forces\r\nto Mozambique, Kuwait and Cyprus: a field hospital, a unit\r\nof engineers and an infantry battalion respectively.\r\nArgentina has the firm political determination to support\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, within its means.\r\nAt the same time, I am obliged to mention some issues that\r\ncurrently affect the normal development of the operations\r\nand that somehow limit the ability of Member States to\r\nparticipate to the extent they would desire.\r\nWe consider it a priority to do as much as possible in\r\norder to guarantee the safety of the men and women who\r\nparticipate in peace-keeping operations.\r\nThe arrears in the payment by Member States of their\r\ncontributions and the subsequent delays in reimbursements\r\nto troop-contributing Governments have created very serious\r\nfinancial problems for those Governments. For that reason -\r\nand also because of their own domestic budget limitations -\r\nthese countries find it ever more difficult to increase their\r\ncontributions of troops and equipment. A mechanism should\r\nbe established at once to find a solution. In this context, we\r\nwelcome the efforts of the office of the Secretary-General,\r\nas well as the initiative with respect to creating stand-by\r\nforces.\r\nThe priority goal of peace also imposes on us a firm\r\ncommitment to each State in the struggle against the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This\r\ncommitment is one of the main focuses of Argentine foreign\r\npolicy. Hence, we have brought total transparency to the\r\nArgentine nuclear programme. With that aim in view, we\r\nand Brazil have signed an agreement on full-scope\r\nsafeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA); we have already ratified it. In the same spirit, we\r\nhave discontinued the missile project CONDOR II.\r\nIn addition, together with Brazil and Chile, we have\r\npromoted amendments to the Treaty of Tlatelolco that would\r\nstrengthen that major agreement and make it effective; we\r\nhope that these will soon be approved by the Argentine\r\nParliament.\r\nAt the same time, Argentina has been admitted to the\r\nMissile Technology Control Regime, whose guidelines we\r\nhave included in our domestic legislation, and is a member\r\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nof the so-called Australian Group. We are among the\r\noriginal signatories of the Convention on Chemical\r\nWeapons, and we participated actively in its drafting; we\r\nwill soon start the proceedings for its legislative approval.\r\nWe firmly support the negotiation, in the framework of\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament, of a treaty to ban all\r\nnuclear tests. The moratorium respected in practice by the\r\nnuclear Powers points to the existence of favourable\r\nconditions for the total ban of such tests.\r\nIn the field of armaments, we support the United\r\nNations Register of conventional weapons, to which we have\r\nrecently supplied all the relevant information and data. We\r\nare particularly interested in the functioning of the Register\r\nin our own region; last March, in Buenos Aires, we\r\norganized, jointly with the United Nations, a very successful\r\nregional seminar on this very important subject.\r\nLatin America is now going through a promising stage.\r\nThe climate of cooperation and harmony prevailing in the\r\nregion contributes to political stability and economic\r\ndevelopment. The expansion and consolidation of\r\ndemocracy and economic and social growth have also been\r\nstimulated as a result of the strong impetus given to the\r\nprocess of regional integration. As regards the Common\r\nMarket of the South (MERCOSUR), Argentina expresses the\r\nfirm political will and determination to contribute to its\r\nstrengthening. In this context we must acknowledge the\r\npositive role of the Rio Group, which has been consolidated\r\nas an increasingly useful and trustworthy mechanism for\r\ndialogue, cooperation and consultation.\r\nThe Group’s information and internal communication\r\nsystems have been enhanced, which enables it to take unified\r\npositions on common problems. This has increased its\r\ninfluence in the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS), where it has played a constructive\r\nand effective role, for example in relation to the crisis in\r\nHaiti.\r\nIndeed, Haiti is a case in which we note the opening of\r\na path towards democracy - albeit with certain difficulties.\r\nArgentina welcomes the agreement reached under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations and the OAS for the\r\nrestoration of democracy in that nation, through the\r\nsuccessful mediation of Mr. Dante Caputo, whose\r\nperformance is a source of legitimate pride for my country.\r\nProvided that the Haiti agreements are respected in their\r\nentirely, effective 30 October the Argentine Republic will\r\ncontribute, in the framework of relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, a field hospital to be used in the operation the\r\nUnited Nations and the OAS will conduct together to support\r\nthe consolidation of democracy in that country.\r\nAs regards El Salvador, we note with satisfaction the\r\nsubstantive progress represented by the peace agreements\r\nrecently signed. We trust that the elections to be held next\r\nMarch will mark a decisive stage in efforts to consolidate\r\ndemocracy.\r\nWe also express our support for the re-establishment of\r\nconstitutional order in Guatemala and we encourage its\r\npeople and Government to continue their efforts to\r\nstrengthen democracy and the rule of law.\r\nThere has been remarkable progress in the consolidation\r\nof a climate of peace and détente in Latin America as a\r\nwhole, thanks to the restoration of democracy and to\r\neconomic reforms. There is still one case about which we\r\nare concerned and about which we have repeatedly\r\nexpressed our hope for profound change. The best option is\r\nto move forward in the same direction as the rest of the\r\ncontinent. Delays will only bring about more suffering for\r\nits people and more concern on the part of their Latin\r\nAmerican brothers.\r\nThe strengthening of a climate of harmony in Latin\r\nAmerica requires new ideas leading to the development of\r\na structure of regional security adapted to the present times\r\nand based on cooperation, balance and transparency. We\r\nbelieve that cooperative security is a realistic and feasible\r\nproposal for Latin America, and we urge the countries of the\r\nregion to give it special consideration.\r\nLatin America must enter fully into the new\r\ninternational context. In accordance with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s ideas on the role of regional organizations as\r\nstated in his \"Agenda for Peace\", it should strengthen the\r\ncontribution of the Organization of American States to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nArgentina shares with the rest of the international\r\ncommunity the constant anguish caused by the conflict\r\nunfolding in the former Yugoslavia and supports efforts\r\naimed at an urgent solution.\r\nWe are contributing significantly to the work of the\r\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), a force that\r\nhas helped save thousands of lives and has worked to\r\nprevent the intensification of conflict in the areas where it is\r\ndeployed.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 27\r\nWe support the resolutions of the Security Council on\r\nthis subject, and strongly condemn the practice of \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\" and other war crimes. Consequently, we support\r\nthe establishment of an international tribunal to try those\r\nallegedly responsible for violating international humanitarian\r\nlaw. We particularly condemn the inhuman attacks on the\r\ncivilian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina and reaffirm\r\nthe need to reach an agreement acceptable to all parties\r\ninvolved, based on the principles of the London Conference.\r\nWe are deeply concerned particularly about the serious\r\nconsequences that civil and international armed conflicts\r\nhave on children. We urge the international community as\r\na whole to devote the utmost attention to this serious\r\nproblem and to initiate with the greatest urgency appropriate\r\nassistance plans to alleviate the suffering of children,\r\nespecially in situations like the one in Somalia or the former\r\nYugoslavia. This question - like those concerning the family -\r\nshould be given the greatest attention by organizations such\r\nas the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).\r\nWith respect to Cyprus, I reiterate our support for a\r\nprompt solution to the conflict, and we urge the parties to\r\naccept the plan developed by the Secretary-General’s\r\nmission of good offices.\r\nI also reaffirm our express support for United Nations\r\nresolutions aimed at guaranteeing the territorial integrity of\r\nKuwait and peace and security in the region. We will\r\ncontinue to support the recently adopted Security Council\r\ndecisions that, in connection with this specific case, demand\r\nrespect for the inviolability of the international border - that\r\nhave already been defined - and the right of navigational\r\naccess.\r\nAs regards South Africa, we welcome, together with the\r\nrest of the international community, the recently adopted\r\nlegislative measures aimed at guaranteeing free and fair\r\nelections next April and establishing the Transitional\r\nExecutive Council. We continue to support the multiparty\r\nnegotiating process towards a democratic, united and non-\r\nracial South Africa. This is another of those world events\r\nthat are on the point of crystallizing in the next few months,\r\nand whose importance is really much greater than we could\r\nhave imagined even just a few months ago.\r\nI must mention once again the question of the Malvinas\r\nislands, just as we did a few weeks ago before the Special\r\nCommittee on decolonization. I reaffirm Argentina’s\r\nwell-founded and unequivocal sovereign rights over those\r\nterritories and over the South Georgia and South Sandwich\r\nislands. The peaceful and negotiated recovery of the islands\r\nis a central and permanent issue in our foreign policy.\r\nThe United Nations Special Committee on\r\ndecolonization, at its recent session, adopted, for the first\r\ntime without a vote, a resolution on this question, in which\r\nthe parties are once again urged to start negotiations. We\r\ntherefore stand ready to do so.\r\nAs I informed the Special Committee, our relations with\r\nthe United Kingdom would be excellent but for the conflict\r\nin the South Atlantic, where apart from the central dispute\r\nthere are problems in specific areas. However, within this\r\noverall picture, there has also been progress in some of those\r\nareas.\r\nWe have made progress in reducing the security\r\nrestrictions inherited from the 1982 conflict and we have\r\nreached a provisional understanding on fishing for 1993.\r\nWe now have to negotiate a new agreement - which is being\r\nmade difficult because of certain recent unilateral British\r\njurisdictional decisions over the South Georgia and South\r\nSandwich islands - that must necessarily reflect Argentina’s\r\nlegitimate decision now to relate its own catch to the actual\r\npotential of the area.\r\nAs regards oil, there is still an impasse, both because of\r\nthe rejection of a specific proposal for cooperation put\r\nforward by Argentina and because of the United Kingdom’s\r\npreference for acting unilaterally. We are still convinced\r\nthat there is no realistic alternative to cooperation. We are\r\nsure that potential investors will also see it that way, because\r\ntheir situation would be highly uncertain and unstable in any\r\nother context.\r\nArgentina’s relationship with the islanders is an area in\r\nwhich there have been important developments in the last\r\nfew months.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, there\r\nhave been communications between the inhabitants of the\r\nislands and Argentina. I personally have been in touch\r\nseveral times with some of them. My Government reiterates\r\nits conviction that it is in everybody’s interest to establish\r\nnormal relations between the islands and the continent. We\r\nreaffirm that Argentina and the United Kingdom are the only\r\nparties to the dispute, but we underline also our willingness\r\nto conduct a dialogue with the inhabitants of the territory\r\nbecause they deserve our consideration and respect. We are\r\nalso aware of the weight their opinion carries in London.\r\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe dialogue with the islanders has wide support in my\r\ncountry, and is a natural development in the civilized search\r\nfor a solution to the conflict. It is important that the\r\nislanders themselves also understand that this is an inevitable\r\nstep, because the only realistic alternative is to march\r\nforward together.\r\nThe recent World Conference in Vienna ratified the\r\nuniversal and binding nature of respect for human rights.\r\nToday it is no longer possible to claim, as despotic\r\ngovernments have in the past, that the treatment States afford\r\ntheir citizens is exclusively an internal affair.\r\nIt is a fact that the principle of absolute sovereignty has\r\nbecome relative and that the international community, acting\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations, has laid the\r\nlegal foundations for denouncing violations of human rights\r\nwherever they occur and for implementing specific measures\r\nto ensure that human rights can be exercised to the full. We\r\ntherefore support the establishment of the post of High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\r\nFurthermore, in the opinion of the Argentine\r\nGovernment, there must be universal and complete freedom\r\nof the press, because this is a fundamental guarantee of\r\nrespect for other essential human rights. Whatever excesses\r\nthere may be in the exercise of press freedom are nothing\r\ncompared with the awful drawbacks of policies that restrict\r\nthat freedom.\r\nArgentina supports the restructuring of the United\r\nNations economic and social system in order to increase its\r\neffectiveness and global credibility in that area.\r\nIn the field of the environment and development, we\r\ncontinue to give high priority to the implementation of\r\nAgenda 21 and the Conventions on climatic change and\r\nbiodiversity and to the use of the global environment facility\r\nas a financial mechanism for implementing environmental\r\nprojects in the those and the related areas of marine\r\npollution and the ozone layer.\r\nArgentina will participate actively in the International\r\nConference on Population and Development to be held in\r\n1994. We support the negotiating process now under way\r\nand we agree with the conceptual framework agreed upon\r\nfor the programme of action in that field.\r\nWe shall also participate actively in the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, and we stress the great importance\r\nof the negotiating process and of what is included in the\r\nSummit’s agenda.\r\nI should like to refer to the deterioration in the\r\nOrganization’s financial situation, which is so seriously\r\naffecting its regular activities and is endangering the normal\r\nfunctioning of peace-keeping operations.\r\nReality tells us that the only way to solve the problem\r\nis the timely payment in full of the financial obligations of\r\nMember States. Such payment is a fundamental factor in\r\nrestoring the financial soundness of the United Nations, but\r\nit is undoubtedly not the only one. We consider that it is\r\nindispensable for immediate steps to be taken to make the\r\nallocation and use of the Organization’s scarce resources\r\nmore efficient, thus avoiding administrative disorder and\r\npossible irregularities or substandard management practices.\r\nA proper balance between budgetary control and the\r\nimplementation of activities will enable us to achieve the\r\nfinancial consolidation needed to fulfil the goals set out in\r\nthe Charter.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to reiterate our firm conviction\r\nthat, despite the serious problems that still obtain, we are\r\nwitnessing an encouraging development in the principles that\r\nin their time guided the founding fathers of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThose ideals of universal peace today seem more within\r\nour grasp and in that context the Argentine Republic, a\r\ndemocratic and peace-loving nation, is genuinely willing to\r\ncontribute to strengthening an international system based on\r\nlaw and justice, and guaranteed by the United Nations.\r\nMr. PETERSEN (Denmark): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating President Insanally of Guyana on his election\r\nto the presidency of the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I feel confident that under his guidance we shall\r\nsucceed in strengthening the United Nations and establishing\r\npeace and prosperity.\r\nThe number and importance of the challenges facing\r\nthe United Nations after its almost 50 years of existence call\r\nfor reforms. The number of Members is increasing. Now\r\nthat the cold war has ended, the United Nations, and notably\r\nthe Security Council, is in a better position than ever to\r\nfunction as foreseen in the Charter. The peoples of the\r\nworld are looking more and more to the United Nations to\r\nsolve their conflicts. The United Nations is expected to\r\nbring political stability and economic prosperity to all parts\r\nof the world. The United Nations is expected to play a\r\nleading role in surmounting the poverty gap. It is expected\r\nto secure ecologically sustainable development. The United\r\nNations is expected to provide development assistance,\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 29\r\nenvironmental assistance and emergency assistance. It is\r\nexpected to play a leading role in securing democracy and\r\nrespect for human rights, including women’s and children’s\r\nrights. It is expected to bring relief to refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons. And the United Nations is expected to\r\nprevent the spread of the means of mass destruction.\r\nReform of the United Nations is necessary to meet\r\nthese challenges. Let me concentrate on seven items on the\r\nreform agenda.\r\nFirst, Denmark attaches particular importance to the\r\nrole of the Security Council as stated in the Charter. The\r\nefficiency of the Council in making decisions during the\r\nrecent past has raised new expectations as to its ability to\r\nrespond to crises.\r\nIt is therefore important to ensure that the Council\r\nmembership reflects the situation of today. The Government\r\nof Denmark recognizes that the developing countries have a\r\ncase for improving their representation. We also recognize\r\nthat there are countries with global influence and\r\nresponsibilities that may wish to see this acknowledged in\r\nthe composition of the Security Council. Those Member\r\nStates will, I am sure, also assume a special responsibility\r\nvis-à-vis the activities of the United Nations and, in\r\nparticular, to contribute politically, militarily and financially\r\nto the implementation of the Council’s decisions.\r\nAs my second point I wish to recall that Denmark has\r\nalways participated actively in the peace-keeping operations\r\nof the United Nations. Consequently, it stands ready to\r\ndiscuss how to strengthen the Organization in the area of\r\npeace-keeping, peacemaking and preventive diplomacy. The\r\nNordic countries intend to follow this question with\r\nparticular interest with a view to putting forward proposals\r\nduring this session of the Assembly.\r\nThe deployment of a largely Nordic peace-keeping\r\nforce in Macedonia is a concrete example of preventive\r\ndeployment. In addition, Denmark is setting up a reaction\r\nbrigade of 4,500 soldiers. They could be deployed in peace-\r\nkeeping, peacemaking and humanitarian United Nations\r\noperations. We are ready to make part of that force\r\navailable for the United Nations stand-by force arrangement.\r\nThe stand-by force arrangement could be vital in improving\r\nthe planning, reducing the lead-time and increasing the\r\nflexibility in the peace-keeping field.\r\nDenmark supports a more active role for the United\r\nNations in conflict prevention and crisis management. I\r\nwelcome the fact that some of the recommendations in \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\" in this respect have already been\r\nimplemented.\r\nThirdly, the World Conference on Human Rights in\r\nJune this year in Vienna reaffirmed the universal character\r\nof human rights. The conference also focused on the human\r\nrights of women, and rightly so: women’s rights are human\r\nrights.\r\nThe General Assembly should decide to establish the\r\npost of high commissioner for human rights, as\r\nrecommended by that Conference. We should also take\r\nsteps substantially to increase the resources for the United\r\nNations human rights programme, including the United\r\nNations Centre for Human Rights.\r\nThere are times when the principle of non-interference\r\nin the internal affairs of a Member State must yield to a\r\ndecision by the international community to secure respect for\r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms, such as freedom\r\nfrom hunger and protection from genocide. Furthermore, the\r\nright of the civilian population to receive humanitarian\r\nassistance must also be respected, regardless of national\r\nfrontiers.\r\nDenmark fully supports efforts to secure the safety and\r\nprotection of United Nations personnel operating in areas of\r\narmed conflict.\r\nFourthly, we also need a strong United Nations in the\r\neconomic and social fields. The United Nations must\r\nrespond effectively to the economic and social needs of the\r\ndeveloping countries. There can be no lasting peace and\r\nsecurity unless the growing inequalities are addressed. The\r\n\"agenda for development\" to be drafted in the coming year\r\nby the Secretary-General will, it is hoped, contribute to\r\nsetting the priorities for the United Nations for the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nBy attaining the accepted United Nations targets for\r\nofficial development assistance - 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product and within that 0.15 per cent to the least\r\ndeveloped countries - we would dramatically increase the\r\nvolume of support for the developing countries. That would\r\nalso clearly demonstrate the world’s commitment to deal\r\nseriously with its economic and social problems.\r\nFifthly, as is well known, Denmark contributes\r\nsubstantially to United Nations development activities. Our\r\ncontributions must be used to the optimum benefit of\r\ndeveloping countries and not lost in bureaucracy and\r\ninefficiency. We must convince donors that the United\r\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nNations and its funds and programmes can serve as efficient\r\nchannels for a large part of their development assistance. If\r\nnot, other channels will increasingly be used. Member\r\nStates must demonstrate their commitment to fundamental\r\nreform - not just window-dressing.\r\nDuring the past year a compromise solution for\r\nrestructuring and revitalizing the United Nations in the\r\neconomic and social fields was carefully negotiated, but\r\nfinally not agreed upon. The Government of Denmark\r\ndeeply regrets this situation. We sincerely hope that it will\r\nbe remedied by this session of the General Assembly.\r\nSixthly, it must be recognized that social peace is as\r\nimportant as strategic peace. We see the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development to be held in Copenhagen in March\r\n1995 as an opportunity to put people at the centre of\r\ndevelopment. To us, democratic practices and fair\r\ndistribution of resources are closely related to dynamic\r\neconomic development.\r\nThe Copenhagen Summit and the fourth World\r\nConference on Women will both mark the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations in 1995. The preparations\r\nfor the women’s Conference should lead to a substantial\r\ninput for the Copenhagen Summit. Likewise, the outcome\r\nof the Copenhagen Summit ought to be a strong message\r\nfrom the world’s leaders signalling their commitment to\r\nclosing the gap between men’s and women’s social and\r\neconomic opportunities.\r\nMy seventh point concerns the Secretariat. Since he\r\ntook office the Secretary-General has carried out a number\r\nof changes in the Secretariat. I commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for these changes and assure him of our support in\r\nhis efforts to make the Secretariat more efficient.\r\nAll efforts should be undertaken to eradicate corruption,\r\nwaste and mismanagement in the Secretariat. I welcome the\r\nestablishment of the post of Assistant Secretary-General for\r\nInspections and Investigations. This is the first step towards\r\nthe creation of the post of Inspector-General. But such\r\ninitiatives cannot of themselves solve the financial crisis of\r\nthe United Nations. That requires that Member States pay\r\ntheir assessed contributions on time and in full. That is one\r\nof the basic requirements for membership of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nI fail to understand how Member States, including some\r\nof the permanent members of the Security Council, can call\r\nfor United Nations assistance, including in peace-keeping\r\noperations, and then not pay. This leaves the United Nations\r\nunable to perform vital functions. It also leaves troop -\r\ncontributors such as Denmark with the problem that the\r\nUnited Nations does not honour its financial obligations to\r\nus - that is, to repay expenses for Danish United Nations\r\npersonnel and equipment.\r\nLet me now turn to a few current problems facing the\r\nworld and the United Nations.\r\nIn the Middle East we are witnessing a historic\r\nbreakthrough. I pay tribute to the Israelis and the\r\nPalestinians for having taken this step towards a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting solution. I commend\r\nNorway for its role in bringing about this agreement.\r\nI also welcome the fact that Israel and Jordan have\r\nsigned an agenda for further negotiations. I hope that\r\nprogress will soon be made in the Israeli-Syrian and\r\nIsraeli-Lebanese tracks of the peace process.\r\nAmple support, both economic and political, is essential\r\nto keep momentum, and must be provided by the\r\ninternational community. Denmark, at an early stage,\r\ntogether with the other Nordic countries, decided to pledge\r\na substantial amount. We have also demonstrated our\r\ncommitment to the developments in the Middle East region\r\nthrough the European Community, the major donor in this\r\ncontext.\r\nIn contrast, it is with dismay we see the developments\r\nin the former Yugoslavia. The international community\r\nshould accept only a solution reached by peaceful means and\r\nnegotiations. In this connection, I pay tribute to the tireless\r\nefforts of Lord Owen and Mr. Thorvald Stoltenberg.\r\nThe solution to the crises must respect the\r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina. We cannot accept a territorial solution\r\ndictated by Serbs and Croats at the expense of the Bosnian\r\nMuslims. It is extremely important now that all parties show\r\nthe necessary flexibility in order to arrive at a solution they\r\nall can freely agree to. Such an arrangement must ensure\r\nthe protection of human rights and the rights of minorities.\r\nSanctions will remain in place until conditions for their\r\nlifting have been met. They should not be eased before a\r\npeace agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina is under faithful\r\nimplementation by the Serbian side. Future attempts to\r\nhinder humanitarian aid and the guaranteed free passage of\r\nconvoys are unacceptable and will have serious\r\nconsequences for relations between the party responsible and\r\nthe European Community.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 31\r\nBy its resolution 827 (1993), the Security Council\r\ndecided to establish the International Tribunal for the\r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of\r\nInternational Humanitarian Law committed in the Territory\r\nof the Former Yugoslavia since 1991. Denmark strongly\r\nsupports this decision.\r\nThe conflict in the former Yugoslavia is probably the\r\nmost difficult task taken on by the United Nations in its\r\nhistory. Denmark participates in the United Nations\r\nProtection Force with almost 1,300 peace-keepers and has\r\nmade substantive contributions to the European Community\r\nMonitoring Mission. Large numbers of Danes are also\r\ninvolved in the humanitarian work carried out under the\r\nauspices of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees. In addition, Denmark has made\r\nlarge financial contributions to the various international relief\r\nprogrammes and through Danish non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nResponding to the calls for swift and effective\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 836 (1993) on\r\nsafe areas, the Nordic countries have decided to field a joint\r\nNordic United Nations battalion group of about 1,300 men\r\nto protect the safe areas around Tuzla in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. The force is expected to be ready for\r\ndeployment in October. That decision is evidence of the\r\nwillingness of the Nordic countries to make their\r\ncontribution to resolving the tragic conflict and protect the\r\ncivilian population from the horrors of war.\r\nIn the African continent, we see both hope and\r\ncontinued distress, regional conflicts and violations of basic\r\nhuman rights.\r\nAs Mr. Nelson Mandela eloquently told the Special\r\nCommittee against Apartheid last Friday, historic advances\r\ntowards democracy in South Africa have been achieved. I\r\nwelcome his call to lift the economic and diplomatic\r\nsanctions vis-à-vis his country. I also share his view that\r\nthis will give added impetus to the process, and strengthen\r\nthe forces, of democratic change.\r\nI wish to recall the decision of the European\r\nCommunity and its member States on 8 June 1993 to adjust\r\ntheir policy towards South Africa concurrently with\r\ndevelopments towards majority rule and democracy.\r\nDenmark stands ready to support South African efforts\r\nto normalize relations with the United Nations. The United\r\nNations, for its part, should support South Africa during its\r\ndifficult transitional period. An urgent priority should be to\r\nsupport the first democratic elections. It is essential that\r\nthey be free and fair. I can only echo Mr. Mandela’s call\r\nlast week to the Security Council to consider how the United\r\nNations can best support South Africa in this endeavour. It\r\nmust be ensured that this last mile on the road to democracy\r\nis successful. Denmark intends to make a substantial\r\ncontribution. We will also - once the Transitional Executive\r\nCouncil has been established - initiate a programme of\r\ntransitional assistance to South Africa amounting to\r\napproximately 600 million Danish kroner, or about $100\r\nmillion.\r\nThe level of violence in South Africa remains\r\nunacceptably high; it is the single most serious threat to the\r\nprocess. We appeal to all parties to make every effort to\r\nstop the violence. The international community should\r\ncontinue to support such efforts.\r\nIn Somalia the situation is still very grave. The\r\ndeplorable actions in the form of continued attacks directed\r\nagainst the United Nations Operation in Somalia forces and\r\nrelief and aid personnel cannot be condemned strongly\r\nenough. All parties in the civil strife must understand that\r\nviolence does not pay in the long run. We support the\r\nefforts by the United Nations to bring about a negotiated\r\nsettlement in Somalia as well as the efforts to relieve the\r\nsuffering of the people.\r\nCivil strife and violations of the most basic human\r\nrights have characterized the Sudan for far too long. The\r\nSecretary-General has appointed a Special Envoy\r\nHumanitarian Affairs for the Sudan. Denmark urges all\r\nparties to seek political solutions to the problems of the\r\ncountry. We fully support the work of the Special Envoy as\r\nwell as other steps to redress the prevailing situation,\r\nincluding the violation of human rights.\r\nDenmark congratulates the people of Cambodia on the\r\nhistoric and successful elections for a Constituent Assembly\r\nand on that Assembly’s presentation of a new constitution.\r\nThe impressively high voter participation and the Constituent\r\nAssembly’s dedication in fulfilling its task constitute a\r\nvictory for democracy and for the peace process.\r\nI also wish to thank the Secretary-General, the United\r\nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) and\r\nparticipating international polling-station officers for their\r\nenormous effort and hard work.\r\nThe international community must continue its support\r\nfor the peace process and for the reconstruction of\r\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nCambodia. I can confirm Denmark’s commitment in that\r\nrespect.\r\nThis year, 1993, is the International Year of the\r\nWorld’s Indigenous People. The Government of Denmark\r\nwishes to promote indigenous peoples’ own organizations\r\nwith a view to their full participation in political, economic,\r\nsocial and cultural life. In collaboration with the Home Rule\r\nGovernment of Greenland, we support all efforts to increase\r\nawareness of the special situation facing indigenous peoples,\r\nincluding the Inuit of Greenland.\r\nA particular concern of Denmark is that the indigenous\r\npeoples who have been permanent residents of the Arctic for\r\nmillenniums are at risk from environmental degradation. On\r\n16 September 1993 the Government of Denmark and the\r\nHome Rule Government of Greenland hosted the second\r\nMinisterial Conference on the Arctic Environment, at Nuuk,\r\nthe capital of Greenland. In the Nuuk Declaration, adopted\r\nand signed at that Conference, the eight Arctic countries\r\nrecognized the special role of indigenous peoples in\r\nenvironmental management and in development in the Arctic\r\nand the significance of their knowledge and traditional\r\npractices. The Government of Denmark will establish and\r\nfund a secretariat to promote the indigenous peoples’\r\neffective participation in the Arctic Environmental Protection\r\nStrategy and in the achievement of sustainable development\r\nin the Arctic.\r\nIn conclusion, let me state that there is no alternative to\r\nour United Nations. Only the United Nations has the\r\nnecessary legitimacy to undertake humanitarian action,\r\npeace-keeping operations, the creation of an international\r\ntribunal, and assistance to suffering peoples around the\r\nworld.\r\nAt the same time, the need for reforms in the United\r\nNations is evident. The job facing all of us as Member\r\nStates is to agree in concrete terms on such reforms. We\r\nmust show that behind the words spoken from this rostrum\r\nlies a will to enable the United Nations to serve the many\r\nfunctions we the peoples are asking for.\r\nMr. SYLLA (Guinea) (interpretation from French): I\r\nam delighted to be addressing the General Assembly as the\r\npeople of Guinea commemorate a historic date: 28\r\nSeptember 1958, the day on which Guinea, by a unanimous\r\nvote, chose national independence and sovereignty, thus\r\naccelerating the process of liberation of the African peoples.\r\nIt will be easy, then, to understand the pride and\r\npleasure I take on this anniversary in conveying a message\r\nof peace and friendship from the people of Guinea and from\r\ntheir President, General Lansana Conté.\r\nI join previous speakers in congratulating Ambassador\r\nInsanally on his dazzling election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I wish also to assure\r\nhim of my delegation’s complete support as he carries out\r\nhis responsible tasks. His personal qualities, his wealth of\r\nexperience and the valuable assistance of his fellow-officers -\r\nwhom I also congratulate - bode well for the success of our\r\nwork.\r\nI wish also to convey to the President of the Assembly\r\nat its forty-seventh session, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan\r\nGanev of Bulgaria, my great appreciation for the skill and\r\ndedication with which he guided the work of that session.\r\nFinally, my delegation highly appreciates the\r\npraiseworthy efforts made by the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has worked\r\ntirelessly to build and maintain peace in the face of all the\r\nobstacles in his way.\r\nThe independence of the sister republic of Eritrea and\r\nits admission to membership of the Organization were a\r\nsource of great relief for its people and of genuine\r\nsatisfaction for the international community. I welcome\r\nEritrea and wish it great success in its difficult task of\r\nnational reconstruction.\r\nI welcome the admission of Eritrea, and that of the\r\nCzech Republic, Slovakia and the Principalities of Monaco\r\nand Andorra; this confirms the increasingly universal\r\ncharacter of our Organization.\r\nThe end of the cold war radically changed world\r\ngeopolitics through a rapid series of often unforeseeable\r\nevents. While it is possible to believe that the threat of a\r\nglobal conflagration has been lifted, we note with dismay the\r\nproliferation and exacerbation of armed conflicts that are\r\ncausing immense loss of life, great destruction of\r\ninfrastructure and property, and severe suffering among\r\ncivilians suffering the agony of exile, famine and sickness.\r\nWhat a paradox! On the one hand, the international\r\ncommunity is making intense efforts to prevent or contain\r\narmed conflicts, and on the other hand international action\r\nis not being provided with the resources it needs to eliminate\r\nthe causes and the manifestations of those conflicts. That is\r\na salient feature of today’s international relations.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 33\r\nIn short, more resources are needed to restore world\r\npeace.\r\nNone the less, it is reassuring that recent history has\r\nfavoured the renaissance of the United Nations; thanks to\r\nchanged attitudes and perceptions, the Organization has truly\r\nbecome the guarantor of peace at a difficult moment in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe positive trends that we have seen here and there in\r\nfinding solutions to political problems ought to have\r\npromoted an improvement in the economic and social\r\nsituation in many countries. However, in most developing\r\ncountries, that situation has instead deteriorated seriously.\r\nThe increase in the number of international forums debating\r\ndevelopment programmes has unfortunately not made it\r\npossible to reverse the trend towards the imbalances that I\r\nhave mentioned.\r\nToday, world savings are under severe pressure. What\r\nis happening is that the supply of capital for development is\r\ninadequate relative to the ever-increasing demand from the\r\nAfrican countries, especially if we take into account the new\r\nneeds of the Eastern countries, which are in the throes of\r\ntransition. The world economic crisis is still going on; it is\r\naggravating the disparities and the already precarious\r\nconditions for development being experience by the third\r\nworld countries.\r\nFor Africa, this crisis has been heightened by drought\r\nand desertification, by the stagnation - for which, read\r\nreduction - in official development assistance, by the\r\ndeterioration in terms of trade and its corollary, the marked\r\ndrop in export earnings, by the counter-productive effects of\r\nstructural adjustment programmes and by the external debt\r\nburden.\r\nAllow me to place a particular emphasis on this last\r\nissue. Members will recall that the seriousness of the\r\nindebtedness problem led the African Heads of State or\r\nGovernment to propose holding a special summit on African\r\ndebt. This problem is today still as widespread and as acute\r\nas it was before, despite the relief measures undertaken by\r\nsome creditors. The international community must be\r\npersuaded of the fact that so long as the question of\r\nindebtedness is not studied in a global, concerted manner,\r\nthe socio-economic development programmes of the third\r\nworld will be put in jeopardy as a result.\r\nThe lack of resources for development has as its\r\ncorollary the mass exodus from the countries of the South to\r\nthe countries of the North; indeed, the only viable solution\r\nto this migratory phenomenon lies in economic recovery in\r\nthe countries of the South.\r\nEnvironmental problems - the relationship between man\r\nand his environment - have in recent years quite rightly been\r\na major concern of the international community. Do I need\r\nto stress the fact that man, through his nature-destroying\r\nactivities, has heightened the progressive degradation of our\r\nworld to the point where the alarm bells we hear today are\r\nsounding?\r\nIn the past, man was essentially a passive spectator of\r\nthe natural wear and tear on the ecological system. Today\r\nhe has become the main player in the destruction of the\r\nnatural environment through the combined effects of the\r\ninappropriate design and implementation of a number of\r\nprogrammes, through the improper use of science and\r\ntechnology and as a result of runaway population growth.\r\nIn contrast, real development must also embrace\r\nprotection of the environment and the ecological balance.\r\nThis is precisely why my delegation is emphasizing the need\r\nfor follow-up to the decisions in the Rio Declaration and\r\nAgenda 21. Environmental protection is a common\r\nresponsibility; all nations must contribute to it.\r\nEnvironmental damage, whether man-made or from natural\r\ncauses, spares no region on Earth.\r\nMy country, which used to enjoy good rainfall and was\r\ncalled the watershed of Western Africa, is concerned to see\r\nits rainfall and the rate of flow of its natural watercourses\r\ndiminish. This is why my Government is interested - in\r\nmore than one sense - in the negotiations that are taking\r\nplace within the high-level Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment on drafting an international convention to\r\ncombat desertification and drought in the countries that are\r\nbeing seriously affected.\r\nThe persistence of a number of political crises,\r\nincluding those in southern Africa, Somalia, Liberia, Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina and elsewhere, is a threat to the peace and\r\nsecurity of mankind.\r\nFortunately, there is positive progress in South Africa,\r\nwhere a clear awareness appears to have taken hold\r\nconcerning the vital need to build a democratic and multi-\r\nracial society. The establishment of a Transitional Executive\r\nCouncil, as well as the demonstrations for peace by civilian\r\nsociety and a certain degree of political awareness, are cause\r\nfor optimism, despite some reluctance.\r\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThis remarkable improvement in the political climate,\r\nwhich has been achieved, inter alia, as a result of the spirit\r\nof compromise shown by the various political players, makes\r\nit possible, in my delegation’s opinion, for the economic\r\nsanctions against South Africa to be lifted, as president\r\nNelson Mandela of the African National Congress himself\r\nhas requested.\r\nThat being the case, there is reason for great\r\nsatisfaction in the activities of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) which, through its observer missions and its\r\nAd Hoc Committee on Southern Africa, has contributed\r\ngreatly, in collaboration with the United Nations, to the\r\npeaceful change that has taken place in South Africa.\r\nIn Angola, after lighting a glimmer of hope, the process\r\nof national reconciliation seems to be blocked by the\r\nincreased fighting resulting from UNITA’s intransigence.\r\nBut only observance by the parties of the Bicesse Accords\r\nand of the election results will allow the Angolan people to\r\nregain peace and security. The Security Council’s decision\r\non 15 September 1993 recommending the application of\r\nsanctions against UNITA must be strengthened and\r\nimplemented strictly, because only constant firmness with\r\nUNITA and its leader will make it possible to put an end to\r\nthis painful civil war that is sowing death and destruction.\r\nWith regard to the Western Sahara, the parties\r\nconcerned must cooperate with the Secretary-General and\r\nwith all willing parties in order to implement the peace plan,\r\nwhich is vital for there to be a happy ending to this crisis.\r\nFor almost four years now, Liberia has been the theatre\r\nfor one of the bloodiest civil wars on our continent. The\r\nrefusal by some of the parties to the conflict to compromise\r\nhas caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people\r\nand considerable material destruction, not to mention the\r\nmassive outpouring of refugees and displaced persons, in\r\nparticular into neighbouring countries, including my own,\r\nwhich is at present harbouring some 600,000.\r\nHowever, it is a source of comfort to note that the\r\nnegotiations held in July 1993 in Geneva, under the joint\r\nauspices of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) and the United Nations, with the support\r\nof OAU, have made it possible to involve the various parties\r\nto the conflict in constructive dialogue, the only way of\r\nfinding a lasting solution to this dreadful crisis.\r\nThe signing by the parties concerned of the Geneva\r\nAccord under the auspices of ECOWAS on 25 July 1993 at\r\nCotonou means, I hope, that conditions have now been\r\ncreated for a definitive return of peace and stability to this\r\ncountry and to the subregion. But let there be no mistake:\r\nto achieve lasting peace, the expansion of the ECOWAS\r\nMonitoring Group to include African troops from outside\r\nECOWAS, strengthened by the presence of international\r\nobservers, is one of the guarantees to bring about the process\r\nof assembling troops, disarming the belligerents and holding\r\ndemocratic elections in order to achieve a return to normal\r\nconstitutional life.\r\nThe Somali conflict is becoming ever more tragic. The\r\ninternational community must undertake joint, effective\r\naction. In order to achieve a rapid political solution, it is\r\nessential to halt the sudden escalations that are complicating\r\nthe situation in Somalia. The United Nations must resume\r\nits peaceful calling in the face of the many acts of violence\r\nthat are trying both the Blue Helmets and the Somali\r\npopulation.\r\nThe Security Council must decide on a new strategy if\r\nthe last obstacles in the way of pacification are to be\r\novercome and if the mission entrusted to the United Nations\r\nOperation in Somalia is to succeed. My Government calls\r\non all parties to the conflict in Somalia to make their\r\ncontribution to the success of the political process now under\r\nway towards the restoration of peace and security in fraternal\r\nSomalia.\r\nIn the Middle East, after a period of hatred, turbulence\r\nand hesitation, the parties to the conflict are moving\r\nprogressively towards lasting peace.\r\nThe signing on 13 September in Washington of the\r\nagreement on autonomy for Jericho and Gaza, marking the\r\nmutual recognition of the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO) and Israel, resulted from the courage\r\nand political realism of the two parties. Guinea, as a\r\nmember of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable\r\nRights of the Palestinian People, welcomes this happy turn\r\nof events.\r\nFor my country peaceful coexistence between the State\r\nof Israel and the Palestinian State, under the leadership of\r\nthe PLO, must be a constant. After Jericho and Gaza, the\r\nliberation of all the other territories would then promote the\r\nconsolidation of relations between the two communities.\r\nThe march towards global peace in this very sensitive\r\nregion is to be encouraged and supported by assistance from\r\nthe international community, with a view to the socio-\r\neconomic development of the Palestinian State.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 35\r\nIn the Gulf, in order to prevent a new confrontation the\r\ninternational community must ensure that Kuwait and Iraq\r\nrespect the conclusions of the Boundary Demarcation\r\nCommission, which by Security Council resolution 833\r\n(1993) laid down definitively secure and inviolable borders\r\nbetween these two countries.\r\nThe relaxation of tension in Cambodia resulting from\r\nthe success of the elections is putting an end to the long\r\nyears of martyrdom endured by the Cambodian people.\r\nThere is reason to be happy over the positive results of the\r\nefforts by the international community in this area. Respect\r\nfor the Paris Agreements will be the guarantee of lasting\r\npeace and will facilitate the work of national reconstruction\r\nin that country.\r\nWith regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the scale of\r\norganized killings for irrational reasons, such as \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\" and religion, and the prolongation of the conflict\r\nhighlight the divisions in this nation - which until recently\r\nwas strong and united - caused by the end of the cold war.\r\nAfter many efforts, the three communities involved in\r\nthe conflict have still not achieved a stable peace.\r\nUnfortunately, the law of the jungle continues to prevail in\r\nthe face of the impotence of some and the indifference of\r\nothers. There will be true security and lasting peace in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina only after serious negotiations\r\nguaranteed by the international community in general and by\r\nthe States of the subregion in particular.\r\nWith regard to the Korean peninsula, the international\r\ncommunity must support the peaceful reunification of the\r\ntwo States there.\r\nAfrica, like other parts of the world, is at an important\r\nmoment in its history, a time of the democratization of its\r\nsociety and its institutions. The success of this process of\r\nqualitative change requires, none the less, taking into account\r\nthe historic, social and cultural realities of States in order to\r\ngenerate harmonious and lasting development.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea has taken important steps along\r\nthis road. Its achievements include ratification of the\r\nmajority of the African and international Conventions on\r\nhuman rights and humanitarian law; the adoption of the basic\r\nlaw in our country which calls for a presidential regime,\r\nseparation of powers, the primacy of law, political pluralism\r\nand decentralization; the establishment of a Supreme Court\r\nto ensure, among other matters, that there are no\r\nirregularities in balloting; the entry into operation of the\r\nNational Communication Council, whose job it is to ensure\r\nthe freedom of the press and free and equal access by all\r\npolitical parties to State communications media; and the\r\ndetermination of the Government to organize just and open\r\nelections. The presidential balloting will take place on\r\n5 December next, to be followed by elections to the\r\nlegislature.\r\nIn our view, these efforts at democratization in Guinea,\r\nas in most other African countries, should have increased\r\nsupport from development partners to guarantee their\r\nsuccess.\r\nThe convening of a series of international conferences\r\nin 1994 and 1995, particularly those regarding population,\r\nwomen and social development, confirm the interest of the\r\ninternational community in improving the economic and\r\nsocial situation of the most vulnerable sectors of our\r\npopulations. The same is true of their participation in\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe year 1993 has seen the international community\r\ntake a more active interest in the emergence of an era of\r\npeace and universal respect for human rights.\r\nTwo conferences testify to that. Last June in Vienna,\r\nand more recently in Geneva, we gathered together to think,\r\nto evaluate what has been done, to consider prospects for the\r\nfuture, in order to eliminate the causes of suffering, and to\r\nreaffirm our faith in the dignity of the human being.\r\nNone the less, the absence of international machinery\r\nfor the prevention and punishment of serious violations of\r\nhuman rights makes any protection measures ineffective.\r\nMy Government therefore considers that the creation of a\r\npermanent international court with penal powers would be an\r\nimportant step in the protection and promotion of human\r\nrights.\r\nSuch a jurisdiction, by making inevitable the\r\npunishment of the perpetrators of such violations, would\r\nmake existing international law more effective.\r\nHowever, we must eliminate from international affairs\r\nany tendency to be selective with regard to human rights, in\r\nthe form of discrimination over which cases should be\r\ndenounced or over the sanctions that should be applied.\r\nMoreover, the existing link between human rights and\r\nother aspects of social development requires the elaboration\r\nof national programmes capable of promoting: protection of\r\nthe family, which is considered to be the basic unit of\r\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nsociety; the integration of women into development and their\r\nparticipation in the management of public affairs; the\r\nprotection of vulnerable categories of people - children, the\r\naged and the handicapped - by establishing conditions\r\nfavourable to the development of their personalities; and\r\nefforts to combat the production, consumption and illicit\r\ntrafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances through\r\ninternational cooperation, harmonization of national\r\nlegislation and ratification of existing international\r\nConventions.\r\nAlong with these measures, effective strategies must be\r\nevolved to combat the pandemic of AIDS, which, because of\r\nits ravages, is a great scourge and a threat to mankind’s\r\nsurvival.\r\nThe progress achieved in disarmament must be pursued\r\nin the hope that the resources thus released will contribute\r\nto the recovery of the world economy.\r\nIn his report on the work of the United Nations and in\r\nvarious communications the Secretary-General has described\r\nthe Organization’s financial situation as being a matter of\r\ngreat concern. The situation is paradoxical. At a time when\r\nthe United Nations is entrusted with new tasks to be carried\r\nout in the service of peace and development the vital\r\nresources needed for those tasks are diminishing. We pay\r\ntribute to the Secretary-General and to encourage him in\r\napplying austerity measures and in restructuring to increase\r\nthe effectiveness of the United Nations system.\r\nMy delegation strongly urges Member States to honour\r\ntheir financial obligations by paying regularly and on time\r\ntheir assessed contributions in order to ensure the\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations and allow it to play its\r\nrole effectively.\r\nI hope that the message I have just delivered is one of\r\npersistence and hope. This message, based on the realities\r\nof the changes in the post-cold-war world and the divisions\r\nthose changes have caused in some parts of the world, urges\r\nthe Organization to implement new and dynamic strategies\r\nwith a view to establishing a new world order based on\r\nequality, justice, peace, cooperation and respect for\r\ndemocratic values.\r\nThis persistence demands sustained efforts to\r\ndemocratize international relations. The mode of operation\r\nand structure of some bodies in the United Nations system\r\nmust be revised; the decision-making bodies must be\r\nstreamlined and have an equitable representation of States\r\nand regions.\r\nThis persistence is the basis of our hope, a hope of\r\nmastering our collective future on the threshold of the\r\ntwenty-first century, a hope that all people will move\r\ntogether towards peace, the development of nations and the\r\npromotion of human rights. Our collective survival depends\r\non our solidarity and the effectiveness of our actions to\r\ntransform that hope into a reality in international relations.\r\nMr. SKUBISZEWSKI (Poland): I extend\r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Ambassador Samuel\r\nInsanally of Guyana on his election to the presidency of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. May I also thank His\r\nExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria for his\r\ncontribution to the success of the previous session. In\r\naddition, I should like to stress the deep appreciation of the\r\nPolish Government for the work and accomplishments of the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations over the past year.\r\nLet me first speak about some of the timely goals and\r\ntasks of our Organization. I should like to start by\r\ndiscussing the role of the United Nations in organizing peace\r\nafter the cold war. In the post-cold-war era, the United\r\nNations is facing growing expectations and responsibilities.\r\nThat trend will continue over the coming years. In an\r\nincreasingly interdependent world the United Nations,\r\ndespite its shortcomings and limitations, offers the best\r\navenue for addressing those global problems that are still\r\nunresolved and for meeting new challenges as well. The\r\nOrganization faces the task of creating a better, more\r\ndemocratic and just world. In fact, we badly need a vision\r\nof such a world. More often than not, we have to ask\r\nourselves these questions: Are we rising to the occasion?\r\nHow should we resolve the present crisis of leadership, both\r\nwithin individual States and on the international level?\r\nThe United Nations provides an appropriate platform\r\nfor shaping the vision I am talking about. To begin with, it\r\nshould be based on the assessment of geopolitical and\r\ngeoeconomic conditions, in particular on the assumption that\r\nthe world has become pluralistic, whatever the size and\r\nweight of States in international affairs. It should also\r\nreflect an increased awareness of the need for a multilateral\r\napproach to solving problems.\r\nFour years have elapsed since the end of the cold war.\r\nWe must not merely adjust to the new situation, but mould\r\nit, in order to arrive at a comprehensive solution. The\r\npresent crisis has many facets. Today, its primary source is\r\nunresolved economic and social issues, as well as such\r\npolitical problems as territorial disputes and ethnic tensions.\r\nBut we have to remember that the process of finding\r\nanswers to these issues will unavoidably lead in the future\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 37\r\nto a new alignment of power among States and, as a result,\r\nwe shall then face the prospect of recourse to force. That\r\nquestion has been partly addressed by the Secretary-General\r\nin his \"Agenda for Peace.\" The matter has very broad\r\nramifications, and we still have not elaborated a grand\r\nstrategy of democratic transformation. I think that the\r\nUnited Nations should start exploring, in a more systemic\r\nmanner, its role in the world as it is now and as it will be\r\nbeyond the year 2000. One of the preparatory steps might\r\nbe the preparation of a report on the United Nations as a\r\nleader of global change and the promoter of a new world\r\norder after the cold war. Such an assignment could be\r\nentrusted to most-knowledgeable individuals, research\r\ninstitutes, transnational corporations and others. The report\r\nwould serve as a basis for spelling out the future\r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations and the Member\r\nStates.\r\nWe need a thorough re-examination of the priorities of\r\nthe United Nations and, consequently, of the whole United\r\nNations system. The main purpose of reform would be to\r\nadapt the United Nations to the requirements of peace after\r\nthe cold war. Reform should take into account ongoing\r\nchanges in Member States. This applies, in particular, to\r\ncountries in transition, not only in Central and Eastern\r\nEurope but also in various parts of other continents. Let me\r\ntake this opportunity to add that Poland is firmly and\r\nirreversibly committed to the political and economic\r\ntransformation it started in 1989, and that its foreign policy\r\nhas stable priorities.\r\nThe fate of the countries in the process of\r\ntransformation is not their problem alone. Their success or\r\nfailure is unavoidably going to exert a strong impact on\r\nother States. The international community should not fail to\r\nback up the transformation process and to assist the new\r\ndemocracies in their continuing efforts to achieve reform,\r\neconomic recovery, social progress and full participation in\r\ninternational exchanges. Such an approach would assist\r\nthem in their swifter integration into the world economic\r\nsystem.\r\nThe military factor of security retains its significance,\r\nalthough it differs from that of the cold-war era. The United\r\nNations has developed a disarmament agenda. The signing\r\nof the chemical weapons Convention by almost 150 States\r\nshows how the new political climate facilitates long-awaited\r\nagreements and brings us closer to a world free of weapons\r\nof mass destruction. We hope that there will be similar\r\npositive developments in nuclear disarmament. The\r\ninitiation of negotiations on a comprehensive ban on nuclear\r\ntesting constitutes a big step in that direction. The United\r\nNations should also deal with the threat posed by the\r\npossible spread of nuclear-weapon capabilities and the\r\nproliferation of other weapons of mass destruction. Poland\r\nattaches great importance to thorough and constructive\r\npreparations for the 1995 Review Conference of the Parties\r\nto the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\r\nI should now like to turn to the subject of human rights.\r\nThere are a number of reasons why, after the Vienna\r\nConference, the Organization should devote much of its\r\nattention to human rights. In doing so, I believe, it should\r\nreflect on these words used by Secretary-General Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali in addressing the high-level segment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council:\r\n\"The United Nations is, by its very essence, universal,\r\nglobal and inclusive. It is made up of sovereign States,\r\nyet crucially concerned with the well-being of\r\nindividuals. Its concern with individuals, with their\r\nsocieties and with world society is not, as some would\r\nclaim, inherently contradictory.\"\r\nThere are differences of opinion on the scope of human\r\nrights, on State responsibilities in regard to their observance\r\nand on the role of the international community in monitoring\r\nthem. The United Nations organs must expand their\r\nnegotiating and mediatory capacities and show much skill in\r\novercoming these divergences. The essential criteria are\r\nmorality, the inherent dignity of the human person and the\r\nrule of law. Human rights must express the common values\r\nof the international community. Their implementation is\r\nbecoming one of the preconditions of worldwide stability\r\nand security.\r\nFundamental human rights are universal; their substance\r\nis absolute and unrelated to circumstances. But saying this\r\ndoes not mean that we are closing our eyes to the existence\r\nof many different cultures and traditions in the historical\r\ndevelopment of the various regions of the world. This\r\nshould be duly taken into account; however, it cannot justify\r\nany violations of human rights or non-execution of the\r\nrelevant instruments. There is no room for treating criticism\r\nof such unlawful policies and lawful attempts to redress\r\nthem as an infringement of the sovereignty of States. In\r\npromoting, developing and effectively defending human\r\nrights, the United Nations should make these activities part\r\nof its cooperation with States.\r\nInternational peace and security, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and human rights are the three closely related\r\nareas on which the United Nations should concentrate. \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\", Agenda 21 and the forthcoming agenda\r\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nfor development should, in my view, be complemented by\r\nan agenda for human rights. With the results of the Vienna\r\nConference kept in mind, the Agenda for Human Rights\r\nwould constitute a plan of action for setting standards and\r\nimplementing rights and preventing violations.\r\nIndividuals need better and easier access to international\r\nprotection of their rights and freedoms. The Organization\r\nshould revise the grievance procedures and make them more\r\nuniversal. While assuming that the Second and Third\r\nCommittees will merge into one Economic and Social\r\nCommittee, Poland would suggest the establishment of a\r\nHuman Rights and Humanitarian Affairs Committee as one\r\nof the main Committees of the General Assembly. We\r\nrecommend expanding the responsibilities, competence and\r\nrank of the Commission on Human Rights. We also\r\nsupport, as a matter of urgency, the proposal to create an\r\noffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nFurther, we should explore means of promoting human\r\nrights on a regional level. A small bureau, which might be\r\nlocated in Warsaw, could be entrusted with monitoring\r\nhuman rights observance in Eastern Europe. This is a\r\nsensitive region. Such a bureau would be part of the Geneva\r\noffice. I have suggested Warsaw because bodies of the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the\r\nCouncil of Europe already operate there, a fact that could\r\nfacilitate cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEuropean institutions in that field. The region provides\r\nmuch insight into how democracy and human rights are\r\nbeing implemented in States that are undergoing democratic\r\ntransformation.\r\nOne aspect of human rights has become very critical of\r\nlate. I am referring to the increasing violations of\r\nhumanitarian law in armed conflicts, whether international or\r\ndomestic. As the President of the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross emphasized during the recent International\r\nConference on the Protection of Victims of War, held in\r\nGeneva, the practice has undergone a change for the worse.\r\nWith even greater frequency, civilian populations are\r\nbecoming the hostages and primary targets of fighting\r\nwarlords. Each and every day the mass media bring us\r\nscenes of the atrocities of war. We in the United Nations\r\nmust not be indifferent to these facts. Poland joins the call\r\nfor urgent action to revive the observance of humanitarian\r\nlaw and to uphold the authority of the Geneva Conventions\r\nas well as their additional Protocols. The Polish\r\nGovernment strongly endorses the Declaration adopted by\r\nthe Conference on the protection of war victims. In our\r\nview, the international community should pay particular\r\nattention to the observance of human rights and humanitarian\r\nstandards in internal strife. War crimes should not go\r\nunpunished.\r\nThe third task to which I wish to draw the attention of\r\nthe General Assembly is development. The growing gap\r\nbetween rich and poor nations is a significant source of\r\ntensions and conflicts. Even Europe has not been spared,\r\nthreatened as it is by the emergence of a new \"curtain\", this\r\none economic. I am confident that the agenda for\r\ndevelopment under preparation will comprehensively deal\r\nwith the various aspects of this potential danger. We need\r\na new development paradigm that is people-oriented: human\r\nrights have their economic dimension. Economic and social\r\ndifficulties have a decisive impact on international security\r\nand global stability, and often lead to human rights\r\nviolations. The main thing is to create a spirit of partnership\r\nand solidarity. We expect the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Copenhagen in 1995, to specify\r\nthe necessary tasks in social development and thereby\r\nreinforce sustainable economic development.\r\nI shall now discuss some procedures and methods\r\nwhich are particularly topical in view of the goals and tasks\r\nI have enumerated. I will speak first of the settlement and\r\nmanagement of disputes. The new world situation calls for\r\nrenewed and growing attention to international law, its\r\nimplementation and application. Poland welcomes the\r\nenlargement, limited though it still is, of the compulsory\r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. It would\r\nalso be highly desirable if further withdrawals of\r\nreservations to the jurisdictional clauses of treaties followed.\r\nPoland supports the Secretary-General’s call upon all\r\nMember States to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the\r\nCourt before the end of the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law in the year 2000. By means of its\r\nadvisory jurisdiction, the Court might deal with such\r\nquestions as the legal components of political decisions, the\r\nreview of administrative action or the relationship between\r\nsome of the main organs of the United Nations.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes requires a new\r\napproach. Traditional means, as listed in Article 33 of the\r\nCharter might, depending on the merits of each case, be\r\ncombined with peace-keeping, peace-building or even\r\nenforcement measures. We must distinguish between\r\nvarious phases or component parts of the same conflict\r\nwhere each phase will require a different approach or a\r\ndifferent procedure. And let us not forget that there are a\r\ngrowing number of conflicts which cannot simply be\r\n\"settled\", at any rate in the foreseeable future. They should,\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 39\r\nrather, be \"managed\". All this opens up new vistas for the\r\nskilful use of various United Nations mechanisms.\r\nNow I wish to say a few words about peace-keeping.\r\nIt is a subject that is high on the United Nations agenda.\r\nThe success and therefore the image of the United Nations\r\nare at stake here. The \"Agenda for Peace\" has set out a\r\nconceptual framework. Preventive diplomacy,\r\npeace-keeping, peacemaking and, in particular, enforcement\r\nrequire sound guidelines, procedures and detailed planning\r\nin operational terms. Though a great deal of work has\r\nalready been accomplished, much more remains to be done.\r\nThe problems with the clarity of the mandate of the\r\npeace-keeping operations, their time frame, management and\r\nfrugality also require the special attention of the United\r\nNations.\r\nBearing in mind the alarming number of casualties\r\namong both military and civilian peace-keepers, Poland fully\r\nsupports the idea of the expeditious elaboration of a\r\nuniversally binding legal instrument, possibly in the form of\r\na convention on the safety and security of the personnel of\r\npeace-keeping operations. The United Nations should not\r\nundertake new operations without clearly identified\r\nobjectives. What is involved is trust in the Organization and\r\nits prospective contribution to the security of all of us.\r\nRegional conflicts figure prominently on the United\r\nNations agenda. In specific cases regional institutions could\r\nbe helpful, as not all regions have such ready mechanisms\r\nfor dealing with conflict situations. However, they could\r\nstrive to establish them. The Security Council, also, could\r\nplay a role in appropriate instances. The importance of the\r\nregional effort is particularly relevant to Africa, which is\r\nfacing many specific difficulties and problems. We should\r\ndevote more attention to that continent. Poland supports the\r\ninitiatives and programmes that aim at the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflicts and at the creation or strengthening of\r\ndemocratic institutions in Africa.\r\nIn view of the fundamental constitutional reforms now\r\nunder way in the Republic of South Africa, Poland favours\r\nthe lifting of sanctions and other restrictions imposed on that\r\ncountry.\r\nRecent developments in the Middle East have shown a\r\ngenuine will to arrive at a compromise and achieve a\r\npeaceful settlement. Poland shares the view that it would be\r\nappropriate for the General Assembly to endorse the peace\r\nprocess and call for regional cooperation in the Middle East.\r\nAt the same time, the Assembly should refrain from\r\nrepeating such resolutions as could harm this delicate\r\nprocess.\r\nWe believe that the present scale of the conflict in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina could have been avoided had the\r\ninternational community, especially Europe, reacted when\r\nthere was still time. Obviously, I am aware of the fact that\r\nin a conflict whose components are both internal and\r\ninternational, the influence of non-parties is rather limited,\r\nand the solution must finally come from within. Poland\r\nrejects the policy of appeasement and imposed territorial\r\nsettlements.\r\nFinally, there is the issue of sanctions. I should like to\r\ndraw your attention to the implementation of Article 50 of\r\nthe Charter. I think that Member States which suffer heavy\r\neconomic losses as a result of applying sanctions should be\r\nentitled to something more than mere consultations and a\r\ngeneral - hence ineffective - appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to take account of their burden. As sanctions\r\nhave now become more frequent, the resulting problem of\r\neconomic losses by third countries cannot be ignored, as, in\r\nfact, it now is. A satisfactory mechanism should be worked\r\nout as a matter of urgency to resolve this issue.\r\nIn conclusion, the United Nations, like the world around\r\nit, is experiencing a dynamic period of transition influenced\r\nby fundamental reassessments and re-evaluations of the\r\npotential for peace, development and cooperation among\r\nnations.\r\nThe Organization is gearing itself to contribute its share\r\ntowards forging a better future for the world and improving\r\nthe human condition. It has every opportunity to establish\r\na comprehensive agenda within the trinity of peace and\r\nsecurity, sustainable human development, and democracy\r\nand human rights. It can thereby fulfil the Charter promise\r\n\"to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the\r\nattainment of these common ends\".\r\nMr. KARGBO (Sierra Leone): Last year, my Head of\r\nState, Captain Valentine E. M. Strasser, acquainted this body\r\nwith the devastation visited on Sierra Leone as the result of\r\nthe civil war in Liberia. He described to this Assembly the\r\npain and agony that Sierra Leoneans have had to endure as\r\na result of that conflict, and the ramifications it portended\r\nfor regional peace and security.\r\nRegrettably, I am constrained to inform this body, not\r\nonly that the war in Sierra Leone has persisted, but that the\r\nlives of many innocent Sierra Leoneans have continued to be\r\nlost. What we are witnessing today is the internal\r\n40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ndisplacement of more than 400,000 Sierra Leoneans and\r\nmore than 250,000 others who have had to seek refugee\r\nstatus in neighbouring countries, not to mention the\r\ndevastation caused to the national economy.\r\nThus, with our territory devastated and our economy\r\nnearly destroyed, it is understandable that my country is so\r\nanxious that peace should return to Liberia. Without peace,\r\nSierra Leoneans cannot embark on the economic\r\nreconstruction of their country. Sierra Leoneans are also\r\nhopeful that if peace should return, we can start picking up\r\nthe pieces of what is left of our country and get on with our\r\nlives, and that the massive diversion of our resources to\r\nprosecute a rebel war will no longer be necessary. It is also\r\nour hope that with the conflict behind us, the Government of\r\nthe National Provisional Ruling Council will be able to give\r\nits undivided attention to the essential task of nation-\r\nbuilding. We therefore renew our appeal, from this rostrum,\r\nfor timely humanitarian assistance for the hundreds of\r\nthousands of our fellow citizens who have been displaced\r\nand made refugees, for it is only with such help that they\r\ncan start their lives anew.\r\nThe socio-economic assistance of this Organization will\r\nalso be necessary for our post-war reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation efforts. Our cri du coeur is for the\r\ninternational community to provide the requisite support and\r\nassistance for a country desperately in need, through no fault\r\nof its own; a country that has acted as its brother’s keeper,\r\nin the true meaning of that expression, and on behalf of the\r\ninternational community to bring an end to bloodshed and\r\nhelp restore law and order in Liberia.\r\nIt is, therefore, our hope that the latest Cotonou\r\nAgreement on that conflict will continue to pave the path to\r\npeace in Liberia. It was my Government’s expectation that\r\nby now, with the assistance of the Security Council, there\r\nwould have been a rapid establishment and deployment of\r\nthe United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL)\r\nand also meaningful support for the Trust Fund established\r\nby the Secretary-General for the continued engagement of\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) in\r\nLiberia.\r\nPart of that peace plan calls for the establishment of a\r\nbuffer zone along our borders to prevent the infiltration into\r\nour territory of men and matériel from Liberia. In the name\r\nof regional peace and security, we call on this Organization\r\nto give its full support to our request. International help for\r\nECOMOG is particularly necessary when one considers that\r\nfor the past two years, West African countries have been\r\nshouldering the burden of maintaining peace in Liberia\r\nwithout much outside help, in spite of the enormous\r\nproblems facing them individually and collectively. In a\r\nregion which contains 10 of the least developed and poorest\r\nnations, it is obvious that sooner, rather than later, the West\r\nAfrican subregion will not be able to continue with the\r\nECOMOG burden without such outside help.\r\nI would like to issue a note of warning here: the\r\nCotonou Agreement, in our view, offers the last chance to\r\nbring peace to Liberia. If it should fail, we fear that that\r\ncountry might become another Somalia. Hence, the support\r\nof the United Nations remains indispensable. We therefore\r\nhope that Member States will contribute, and contribute\r\ngenerously, to the Trust Fund. Doing so would save lives.\r\nBefore continuing with my line of thought, on behalf of\r\nthe Sierra Leone delegation and on my own behalf, I should\r\nlike to convey warm greetings to Ambassador Insanally on\r\nhis unanimous election to preside over our deliberations\r\nduring the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nIt is also fitting that I express my delegation’s sincere\r\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, his\r\npredecessor, for the able manner in which he executed his\r\ntask and for his personal exertions in the advancement of the\r\nnoble objectives of our Organization.\r\nOur distinguished Secretary-General has, stoically and\r\nwith dedication and determination, continued his yeoman’s\r\nservice on behalf of us all. We congratulate him warmly on\r\nhis latest report.\r\nI should also like to extend the best wishes of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Sierra Leone to the friendly\r\nGovernments and peoples of those countries that have joined\r\nus in this Assembly as full Member States. We have no\r\ndoubt that their admission has not only enhanced the goal of\r\nuniversality; with their new energies they will effectively\r\ncontribute to our quest for a more peaceful world.\r\nWe believe that our Organization is at a crossroad, that\r\nwhat we say and commit ourselves to during this session\r\nwill have serious implications on the shape of things to\r\ncome, and that the rebirth of this Organization will require\r\nlearning from the lessons of the recent past and adjusting our\r\nvision for the future.\r\nSierra Leone had sincerely hoped that the end of the\r\ncold war era would usher in a golden millennium of peace\r\nand prosperity for all. Unfortunately, however, we have\r\nwitnessed a series of situations all over the world that have\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 41\r\ngiven rise to a more violent and insecure international\r\nenvironment. We are faced with conflicts and misery that\r\nhave adversely influenced the lives of vast sectors of\r\nhumanity, and we now feel an even deeper sense of\r\nhelplessness and despair that makes us almost nostalgic for\r\nthe order and logic of bygone days. But nostalgia has no\r\npurpose if it serves only to pander to escapism, without\r\nusing the lessons of the past to guide our future courses of\r\naction.\r\nLet me now turn to an issue that continues to deeply\r\nconcern us all, namely, peace-keeping. The principle and\r\nefficiency of peace-keeping are not in question, but already\r\nexpenditures for peace-keeping have several times over\r\noutstripped the Organization’s regular budget. More\r\ntroubling is the prospect that such expenditures will soon\r\nexceed resources committed to development since the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations. We sincerely believe\r\nthat the time has come when more attention should be given\r\nto conflict prevention and resolution.It would serve our\r\npurpose much better and cost this Organization much less if\r\nconflicts were contained and resolved before reaching the\r\npoint of open hostilities, when situations are more difficult\r\nto control. We can catalogue a series of lost opportunities\r\nof which one glaring example is the Liberian conflict. Let\r\nus, from this point forward, give more attention to the\r\nprevention of conflict rather than having to field troops in\r\nvarious theatres of war at exorbitant cost. Recent events\r\nhave proved that we cannot afford to risk the lives of our\r\nmen in the field in situations that could have been prevented.\r\nLet me reiterate Sierra Leone’s firm conviction and\r\ncommitment to the peace-keeping operations that are now\r\ntaking place throughout the world. We deplore the acts of\r\nthose who have made peace-keepers objects of their\r\nviolence, and we salute the gallant men and women who are\r\nacting on behalf of us all.\r\nHowever, our perseverance in the pursuit of global\r\npeace and in peace-keeping will not reap the desired harvest\r\nif the present proliferation of arms and ammunition to\r\ntheatres of conflict continues. As we all are aware, many\r\nthird world countries where military conflicts are raging\r\ntoday do not manufacture arms. On the other hand, they\r\ncontinue to be the recipients of some of the deadliest\r\nweapons. Such weapons, when supplied to the contending\r\nfactions, be they rebels or others, have as their main victims\r\ninnocent civilians. Today, we are witnessing carnage and\r\nloss of human life, as a result of the use of weapons\r\nacquired by various rebel movements in Africa from arms\r\nmanufacturers over the years.\r\nIt therefore becomes obvious that, if we are to put a\r\nstop to such blood-letting and human carnage, further\r\nstringent measures must be imposed on the sale and\r\nproliferation of arms and ammunition. In our view, into this\r\ncategory falls the proliferation and ever-increasing use of\r\nmines and other explosive devices in the third world which\r\nhave taken a heavy toll in human life, especially innocent\r\ncivilians. Many civilians continue to die because of the\r\nindiscriminate manner in which these mines have been\r\nplanted and used by rebel forces ever since they were\r\nacquired from unknown sources. We therefore welcome the\r\ninitiative taken by the European Community to inscribe an\r\nitem on the agenda of this session of the Assembly to\r\naddress such issues. We believe that the support of the\r\ninternational community is indispensable to dealing with the\r\ndisastrous consequences of the presence of such mines.\r\nWhile still on the issue of conflicts, we wish to reiterate\r\nour support for the recently concluded International\r\nConference for the Protection of War Victims and its\r\nrecommendations. We are firmly convinced that\r\nhumanitarian law must be made completely universal, widely\r\nknown and fully respected, and must be extended to fully\r\ncover non-international conflicts.\r\nMy delegation continues to watch with interest the\r\npolitical developments gaining momentum in South Africa.\r\nYet, much as the ongoing negotiations offer hope for a\r\nresolution of this problem, we are deeply saddened that the\r\ncontinuing violence, directed especially against innocent\r\npeople - the majority of whom are blacks - goes on\r\nundiminished. Violence, in whatever form, is an abhorrence,\r\nbut its pursuit by unscrupulous groups and individuals to\r\nreap political capital, at a time when patience, courage,\r\ncommitment and tolerance are required, can only give us all\r\ncause for concern.\r\nWe therefore wish to appeal to all, regardless of\r\naffiliation, to exercise forbearance and to renounce the use\r\nof violence. But, more so, we call on all Governments and\r\npolitical leaders to use their influence with their supporters\r\nto prevail upon them not to threaten the democratization\r\nprocess and to work constructively for a better South Africa.\r\nThis appeal goes also to all emerging democracies.\r\nNow that the goal of majority rule is in sight, it is time\r\nfor blacks, who have for long suffered under the odious\r\nsystem of apartheid, to close their ranks in solid unity so\r\nthat, together, they may be able to let the new South Africa\r\ncreate an impact on the international scene, for their own\r\nbenefit and the benefit of all South Africans.\r\n42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nWe appeal to black South Africans to forge greater\r\nunity and to be conscious of their responsibility to disprove\r\nthe assertion of the apologists for apartheid that blacks are\r\nincapable of ruling themselves. For it is only when they act\r\nin unison and stop the violence that they will be able to\r\nenjoy the fruits of their freedom struggle, which they have\r\nendured for so long and are, at last, about to win.\r\nSierra Leone has for many years supported a\r\ncomprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict, based on\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\r\nWe see the recent mutual recognition of the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel as an extremely\r\npositive step towards the full restoration of peace in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nWe also encourage all the parties to the ongoing\r\nnegotiations concerning other facets of the Middle East\r\nproblem to demonstrate the same spirit of accommodation in\r\nthe interests of their own people, who for decades have\r\nknown nothing but strife, conflict, suffering and hatred, and\r\nin the interests of peace and of mankind as a whole.\r\nSierra Leone supports the territorial integrity of Kuwait.\r\nI would now like to turn to another important matter in\r\nthis Organization: that is the functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nUndoubtedly, just as a growing number of nations\r\ncontinue to encourage greater participation by their citizens\r\nin the attainment of the ends of the State, so must this\r\nnational awareness of the need for political harmony and\r\njustice be a paradigm instructive to the Security Council,\r\nwhich, as the primary organ responsible for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, should be perceived as\r\nlegitimate in its decision-making process and, thus, should\r\nembrace the views of a wider section of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIt is necessary at this juncture to express our concerns -\r\nconcerns that are shared by many small States Members of\r\nthis Organization - regarding the willingness of the\r\ninternational community, but more so its major players, to\r\nensure respect for the principles enshrined in our Charter.\r\nIt is clear that the time has come to articulate the normative\r\nvalues that are to be pursued in guaranteeing the security of\r\nthose who are not in a position to undertake their own\r\ndefence and to reassure them that their reliance on the\r\nUnited Nations as the guarantor of their sovereignty against\r\nviolations by stronger nations has not been misplaced.\r\nThe failure to halt aggression in some recent cases has\r\nseriously undermined the foundations of the common\r\nsecurity arrangement that the end of the cold-war presaged.\r\nThe repeated indecision with which aggression in different\r\nparts of the world has been confronted has set a dangerous\r\nprecedent by undermining the confidence of small nations in\r\nthe Organization’s protective capacity and by encouraging\r\nautomatic resort to self-defence, with a concomitant increase\r\nin arms build-up. It also goes some way to assuaging the\r\nresidual fears that perpetrators of massive violations of\r\nhuman rights, even genocide, may have had that their\r\ndespicable actions will somehow be met with purpose and\r\nresolve by the international community.\r\nIn the coming days, there must be a firm, unequivocal,\r\ntimely and balanced response from the international\r\ncommunity to threats to and breaches of international peace\r\nand security if the Bosnian experience is not to become a\r\nfeature of relations between States. It is undesirable to allow\r\nthe view to prevail that the international community is more\r\ndisposed to act forcefully in certain instances than in others.\r\nIt is in this vein that we must express our concern over the\r\napparent deterioration of the security situation in Somalia.\r\nWe express the belief that, despite the provocation, a\r\ndistinction must continue to be made between the Somali\r\npeople, the warlords and gunmen. We firmly reject those\r\nwho want to impose tyranny on the Somali people, and we\r\nexpress our heartfelt condolences to the families of those\r\ngallant peace-keepers who have fallen while on duty in\r\nSomalia.\r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights held in\r\nVienna in June this year was a landmark event which was\r\nable to overcome the numerous challenges that it faced.\r\nThat Conference addressed, inter alia, such fundamental\r\nhuman rights as the rights of women and children and\r\nreaffirmed the universality of human rights and the\r\nlegitimate role of the international community in protecting\r\nthese rights worldwide. It also reaffirmed the importance of\r\neconomic, social and cultural rights and the right to\r\ndevelopment, and it adopted several practical steps to\r\npromote and protect human rights in both private and public\r\nlife. The challenge now facing us is to implement the\r\nrecommendations of that Conference.\r\nWe would not like to reopen the debate regarding\r\nhuman rights standards. The United Nations established\r\nthose standards more than 40 years ago. What is important\r\nis that human rights should remain universal and\r\nnon-selective. Human beings all over the world, irrespective\r\nof their race, religion, gender or class, must enjoy equal\r\nrights and protection.\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 43\r\nWe see the re-emergence of racism and ethnic conflict\r\nat its genocidal worst today in various parts of the world.\r\nThe United Nations must assume a much stronger role in\r\ntrying to prevent and minimize the suffering caused to\r\npeople who are subjected to the pain and intimidation of this\r\ndark display of man’s inhumanity to man. Regrettably, in\r\nmany lands today, on every continent and among peoples of\r\nevery race, colour, language and religion, conflicts erupt in\r\nunspeakable violence. As has been observed, ethnic tensions\r\nhave become the racial fault line in widely diverse societies\r\nall over the globe - the advanced, the developing, the\r\nrelatively stable and the unstable alike. We must redouble\r\nour efforts and guard against such dangers.\r\nSierra Leone continues to be concerned by the problem\r\nof refugees and displaced persons, particularly as we\r\nourselves have become victims of such a phenomenon.\r\nApart from the effort to prevent and avert the flow of\r\nrefugees, if our people are to be able to return to their\r\ncommunities, remain there and rebuild their lives they must\r\nhave what the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees calls \"emergency development funds\" to meet their\r\nbasic needs in the areas of health care, education and\r\nemployment. While acknowledging the generosity that the\r\ninternational community has shown in the past in respect of\r\nrefugees worldwide, we appeal to that community in general,\r\nand to the major donors in particular, not to give in to \"aid\r\nfatigue\" but to meet the urgent and felt needs of their\r\nbrethren and sisters, many of whom have found themselves\r\nrefugees overnight through no fault of their own.\r\nSierra Leone therefore urges the international\r\ncommunity to look at these ever-present challenges: how to\r\nassist uprooted people, particularly in the context of conflict\r\nand grinding poverty; how to enable the displaced to return\r\nhome in safety and dignity and rebuild their lives; and how\r\nto prevent and solve refugee problems.\r\nHowever, while providing help and assistance to\r\nmitigate the refugee problem, we remain convinced that\r\nunless and until the international community can overcome\r\nthe scourge of poverty, that problem will remain insoluble\r\nand be constantly with us. It is therefore our fervent hope\r\nthat, even at this late hour, renewed impetus will once again\r\nbe found to prevent and eradicate this condition of human\r\nmisery.\r\nThe necessity of guaranteeing the foundation of a\r\ncommon security evidently goes beyond the reduction or\r\nelimination of military conflicts and embraces human\r\nsecurity as a whole. Indeed, the fortunes of many a society\r\nwill hinge on this, as in many developing countries the root\r\ncause of political and social upheaval or military conflict\r\nremains grinding poverty. Without the eradication of this\r\nscourge, the prospect for human development will remain\r\nbleak. Regrettably, for many of our countries in Africa,\r\nespecially the least developed among us, two years after the\r\nadoption of the New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s our experience has been one of disappointment\r\nand frustration. Even though most African countries have\r\ncarried out the structural adjustment programmes and put in\r\nplace democratic structures, the development partnership\r\npromised by the New Agenda has not been forthcoming.\r\nWith few exceptions, the resources necessary to get the New\r\nAgenda implemented have not been made available.\r\nToday poverty and underdevelopment continue to\r\nplague countries like mine in sub-Saharan Africa despite the\r\ncommendable efforts of this Organization to solve some of\r\nthese palpable problems. It is a matter of regret that the\r\nnew world order seems to have relegated the economic and\r\ndevelopmental needs and problems of Africa to the lower\r\nrungs on its list of priorities. The New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s is failing because of a\r\nlack of funding and support from the international\r\ncommunity. The implementation of this New Agenda\r\nrequires the full participation of the international community,\r\nespecially donor Governments and organizations and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system. It is therefore of\r\nthe utmost importance and urgency that economic, technical\r\nand development assistance be provided to Africa by the\r\ninternational community, which unfortunately has not\r\nresponded sufficiently to our needs. We therefore call on\r\nour partners in development to give us all the support\r\nnecessary to make the reforms that we have carried out\r\nsuccessful and the sacrifices we have made not a mere waste\r\nof time.\r\nOur present situation also underscores an urgent need\r\nfor support for the effective functioning of the proposed\r\nAfrican Economic Community, which is designed to enhance\r\neconomic integration and cooperation in Africa. Financial\r\nand technical assistance must be provided to African\r\nregional and subregional organizations for them to be able\r\nto overcome the socio-economic challenges facing them.\r\nWe fully accept that responsibility for Africa’s development\r\nrests with us Africans, but it is obvious that for us to be able\r\nto achieve and sustain the goal of development, particularly\r\nin the face of all the obstacles against us, including highly\r\nunfavourable terms of trade, we must receive much stronger\r\nsupport from the international community. With such\r\nsupport, the vast potential of the continent will be properly\r\nutilized so that we do not miss yet again an opportunity to\r\nprovide a catalyst for Africa’s meaningful contribution to the\r\n44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ngrowing global economy from which we all must benefit.\r\nIt is for this reason that we look forward to the forthcoming\r\nTokyo International Conference on African Development,\r\nwhich should provide yet another opportunity for committed\r\ninternational support for Africa’s development efforts. We\r\nalso look forward to a balanced and successful outcome of\r\nthe Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and an\r\nexpansion of world trade, improved commodity pricing,\r\ngreater market access and non-restrictive trade practices that\r\nwill work for the benefit of all countries, especially those in\r\nthe process of development.\r\nThe trauma that many African societies are\r\nexperiencing daily in the fight against poverty, malnutrition\r\nand disease must not be allowed to become a way of life.\r\nThe improvement of our people’s lot is as much to be\r\nrealized through aid flows as it is to be guaranteed by\r\nlong-term measures aimed at addressing the heavy debt\r\nburden, discriminatory trade practices and depressed\r\ncommodity prices from which so many of us suffer. We in\r\nAfrica would dearly love to be able to lift ourselves by our\r\nown bootstraps but we cannot do so when our bootstraps are\r\nfirmly in the hands of others.\r\nWe face a most painful dilemma, wherein we find\r\nourselves in a position from which we presently seem unable\r\nto influence the forces that shape our destinies. But the\r\nproblems we encounter as developing countries should not\r\ndeter us from forging ahead to find new ways to\r\ndevelopment and prosperity. The experience gained by such\r\ncountries as Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Thailand and\r\nother South-East Asian countries clearly shows that success\r\ncan be gained in the long run where there is sacrifice,\r\ndetermination and hard work.\r\nThis notwithstanding, Africa’s underdevelopment\r\nremains unique, and unless the international community\r\napplies creative and effective comprehensive measures, such\r\nas debt-for-development swaps and other debt relief\r\nmeasures, the solution to Africa’s economic crisis,\r\nparticularly for countries in the least developed category,\r\nwill continue to be illusory. In a world where the gap\r\nbetween the rich and the poor countries is growing wider\r\nevery day, the need for economic and technical cooperation\r\nbetween developing countries cannot be overstated.\r\nWith regard to the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED), we welcome the\r\nestablishment of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment as a functional Commission of the Economic\r\nand Social Council. What now remains to be put in place is\r\nthe practical implementation of the Commission’s mandate\r\nto ensure the effective follow-up of UNCED. Sierra Leone\r\nwelcomes the decision to convene a Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates in April 1994.\r\nAt the recent United Nations Conference on Straddling\r\nFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the plight of\r\nmany coastal States, including mine, was highlighted\r\nregarding the lack of an effective monitoring, control and\r\nsurveillance system that can be maintained on a sustained\r\nbasis in the face of the continuing indiscriminate advance of\r\ncertain distant-water fishing nations, some of which not only\r\nfish the straddling stocks outside the jurisdiction area, but\r\nenter and violate the territorial rights of our countries. Even\r\nthe fleets of those nations which obtain relevant licenses to\r\nfish do not declare the correct catches for reliable data\r\nrecords. Consequently, the true state of exploitation of the\r\nstocks within the national jurisdiction of most of our\r\ncountries is not accurately known, and so Sierra Leone,\r\ndespite its location in one of the most fertile areas in terms\r\nof marine living resources, realizes only a miniscule amount\r\nfrom these resources as a result of the activities of the\r\ndistant-water fleets.\r\nThis present state of affairs is certainly untenable and\r\nshould not remain unchecked. The exploitation of our\r\nmeagre resources by larger nations and bodies taking\r\nadvantage of our technological weaknesses can only worsen\r\nour economic situation. These wanton fishing practices also\r\nthreaten to deplete the fishing grounds of our nations and to\r\nbecome great environmental hazards. I therefore wish to\r\nreiterate the support expressed by the Sierra Leone\r\ndelegation for the conclusions of that Conference, which we\r\nhope will bring about a radical change in the present\r\nexploitation of our marine resources. I hope our experts will\r\nsoon be able to sit down with experts of the United Nations\r\nto work out modalities that will ensure the equitable and\r\njudicious exploitation of our marine resources.\r\nLooking back at the progress accomplished by mankind\r\nover the past few decades of its quest for peace, security and\r\nsocial progress, we have to admit that the results achieved\r\nhave been mixed.\r\nA few years ago, for example, the world watched with\r\nhope and expectation as nations and societies were infused\r\nwith a new energy which held out the promise of a new,\r\ndynamic era in which our societies would at last realize the\r\npotential for peace and the global environment would be\r\ntransformed for the better. Then, many of us were\r\nconvinced that, if history had taught us anything, it had\r\nimpressed on us that this journey’s success could not endure\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 45\r\nunless we divested ourselves of the old flawed and\r\ndiscredited formulae in which the age behind us had been\r\nembedded. It was our hope that, phoenix-like, we would\r\nrise from the ashes of unfulfilled dreams and start on a\r\njourney towards the fulfilment of our aspirations to a golden\r\nage.\r\nToday, some way into that journey, we have begun to\r\nwonder whether that dream was not a mirage, whether the\r\nnew reality on which so much depends will be shaped with\r\nthe good will and cooperation of all nations, big and small\r\nalike.\r\nIn the past, many of us called for the emerging order to\r\nbe nurtured and shaped by the joint will of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole, mindful as we were of the need to\r\nanchor this new direction on principles we all believed in\r\nand subscribed to. We are still of that view. Yet, though\r\nthe recent months have witnessed a process of revitalization\r\nin the Organization’s responsibilities for crisis management\r\nand its larger engagement with the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, we are increasingly\r\nconcerned about emerging trends that may not augur well for\r\nthe global political and socio-economic transformation we all\r\nanticipate.\r\nThe assurance of international security cannot succeed\r\nfor long unless we are able, as an Organization, to forge\r\ninternational consensus among all Members on measures that\r\nare of primary importance to us all. New energy should\r\nimpel us to find the source of today’s problems, so as to\r\nmitigate the disastrous conditions under which a large\r\nsegment of mankind continues to live. New impetus should\r\nbe given to breaking the constraints that for so long kept us\r\nfrom gaining access to those in need and finding solutions\r\nto their problems.\r\nIt is our fervent hope that all of us, with new vision and\r\ncommitment, will accomplish these goals so that we may\r\nattain the new world order that was conceived within the\r\nparameters of the ideals of this Organization.\r\nMr. CARIAS ZAPATA (Honduras) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): First of all, I take great pleasure in expressing to\r\nthe President of the General Assembly the sincerest\r\ncongratulations of the people and the Government of\r\nHonduras on his well-deserved election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nIn entrusting this very delicate role to him, the\r\ninternational community is recognizing his personal merits\r\nand those of our sister nation of Guyana. We are convinced\r\nthat with his experience and proven capacity he will conduct\r\nthe work of this Assembly with great success.\r\nMy delegation also extends a warm welcome to the\r\nnew Members of our Organization: the Czech Republic, the\r\nSlovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Eritrea, Andorra and the Principality of Monaco.\r\nWe do so fully convinced that within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations we will establish and strengthen strong bonds\r\nof friendship and cooperation with them, and that their\r\nparticipation will contribute effectively to the full realization\r\nof the principles and purposes enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nPursuant to those same principles, the Republic of\r\nHonduras calls, as it did at the previous session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, for greater support and resources to be\r\naccorded to the universal organs for the legal settlement of\r\ndisputes, such as the International Court of Justice, whose\r\nrulings contribute to the peaceful settlement of disputes\r\nbrought before it. We are pleased to state that a year ago\r\nHonduras and El Salvador were handed down a ruling by the\r\nInternational Court of Justice on their border dispute; we are\r\nnow complying with that ruling and the border populations\r\nare living in complete harmony.\r\nOn the question of disarmament, in taking note of the\r\nvital discussion of the destructive power of nuclear weapons,\r\nwe urge the nuclear-weapon States to arrive at sound,\r\nverifiable agreements on the reduction and destruction of\r\nsuch weapons and their means of delivery, taking into\r\naccount the great danger the use of these and other weapons\r\nof mass destruction represents for humanity, and ensuring\r\nthat the growing financial resources released from the arms\r\nrace are transferred to the needs arising from international\r\ncooperation for development.\r\nIt is only natural that, in activities in the field of\r\ngeneral disarmament, priority should have been given to\r\nnuclear disarmament, but this must not impede renewed\r\nefforts in the field of conventional disarmament, particularly\r\non a regional basis.\r\nHonduras has observed with great concern the tragic\r\nsituation still prevailing in Bosnia and Herzegovina: the\r\nescalation of hostilities, massive violations of human rights\r\nand attempts to enshrine in legal instruments territorial\r\nconquests obtained by aggression.\r\nMy country therefore unreservedly supports the Security\r\nCouncil’s efforts to protect the displace populations, to\r\nprovide them with food, medicine and protection, and to\r\n46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nobtain a cease-fire and a solution to the various problems\r\nthat stand in the way of restoring peace to the region.\r\nIn Somalia, there is no national government to ensure\r\nthat the United Nations intervention in that country will not\r\nonly mitigate the hunger which unfortunately afflicts its\r\ninhabitants but also make it possible, with the full\r\nparticipation of the Somalis, to follow the path to peace,\r\ncoexistence and the restoration of normalcy.\r\nThat path of hope has already been taken with great\r\ndetermination in South Africa, and the international\r\ncommunity is rejoicing at the end of the last vestiges of\r\napartheid and the beginning of national reconciliation and\r\nreconstruction.\r\nIt was with rekindled hope that the entire world learned\r\nof the outcome of the negotiations which, under the inspired\r\nmediation of the Government of Norway, led to the recently\r\nsigned historic agreement on mutual recognition between the\r\nState of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization.\r\nThis is one more step towards the normalization of good-\r\nneighbourly relations in the Middle East with respect to the\r\nright to self-determination of peoples.\r\nThe Honduran Government, which has followed with\r\ninterest and concern the fierce struggle that for decades has\r\npitted Israelis and Arabs against each other, welcomes this\r\npositive development and hopes it will be accompanied by\r\npeace agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbours.\r\nSimilarly, our country has followed with great attention\r\nthe course of events in Haiti, where we have welcomed the\r\nagreement reached between President Jean-Bertrand Aristide\r\nand the head of the country’s armed forces, through the\r\nmediation of Mr. Dante Caputo, the Special Envoy of the\r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS).\r\nThe text of this agreement, in addition to contemplating\r\na series of basic provisions for the solution of the crisis,\r\ncalls for the return of Haiti’s legitimate President, and for\r\ncompliance with all commitments undertaken both in the\r\nUnited Nations and in the OAS. Our country expresses its\r\nresolute support for all measures that may be taken to\r\ncomply with the timetable established in the Governors\r\nIsland Agreement, which led to the parliamentary ratification\r\nof Prime Minister Robert Malval, which in turn has made it\r\npossible to suspend the embargo on Haiti.\r\nIn Central America, the Tegucigalpa Protocol of\r\n13 December 1991 has entered into force. It adapts the legal\r\nframework of the former Organization of Central American\r\nStates to the new realities of the region by establishing a\r\nsystem of Central American Integration which, acting under\r\nthe impetus of the regional summits, is strengthening and\r\nfostering a new system of economic, social, cultural and\r\npolitical integration for the benefit of all Central Americans.\r\nIn accordance with this basic objective, my country\r\naspires, with increasing determination and political will, to\r\nsee our region established as a region of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development which is more actively involved\r\nin the new reordering of the international community.\r\nHowever, in spite of the progress in the regional peace\r\nprocess, many of the root causes of the Central American\r\ncrisis persist, and the advances that have been made are only\r\na starting-point in confronting the underlying causes of the\r\narmed conflict which threaten to destroy all that has been\r\naccomplished.\r\nPeace and development will be securely established\r\nonly if a broad and participatory commitment is achieved,\r\ninvolving both the Governments and the organized sectors of\r\ncivilian society of each of our nations.\r\nIt is a fact that the difficulties of any one Central\r\nAmerican country have an effect on all other countries of the\r\nregion. Concerted action within a regional framework is\r\ntherefore necessary, to allow internal processes to be\r\nstrengthened while fully respecting the particular\r\ncircumstances of each country.\r\nThe Government of Honduras therefore appeals to our\r\nfellow Central Americans to meet in the near future in order\r\nto give a new thrust to coordination of the efforts which\r\nbenefit from international support and to make it possible for\r\nus to view with hope the economic integration now under\r\nway.\r\nThe challenge of establishing peace in Central America\r\nrequires that we give priority to the geographical areas most\r\naffected by poverty. This in turn requires us to promote\r\ngreater social participation by deepening the process of\r\ndecentralization through a concept of human development at\r\nthe local level and expressing that social development in\r\nrealistic macroeconomic policies which encourage both\r\ndomestic and foreign investment.\r\nIn Honduras this year we will be holding our fifth\r\nconsecutive general election since the restoration of\r\ndemocracy in 1980, and it is our policy to give firm support\r\nto the economic integration of the Central American isthmus\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 47\r\nin order to consolidate the results of growth with greater\r\nsocial well-being.\r\nA revitalized Central America with sustainable\r\neconomic growth, while respecting the natural environment\r\nand continually acting to rapidly improve the quality of life\r\nof its inhabitants, is the best guarantee of permanent security\r\nfor the region bathed by the Caribbean Sea, within which\r\nCentral America, in harmony with the principles of the\r\nmember countries of the \"Community of the Caribbean\", can\r\nconsolidate an era of peace and cooperation by the end of\r\nthis century.\r\nThe third Ibero-American summit, held at San Salvador\r\nde Bahia, Brazil, examined with concern the subject of\r\ndevelopment, with emphasis on social development. In so\r\ndoing, it reaffirmed in that community of nations the\r\ncommitment to representative democracy, the promotion of\r\nthe observance and defence of human rights, and the\r\npromotion of the economic and social development of our\r\npeoples, which are united by language, tradition and by a\r\nshared future.\r\nTo follow up on what was decided in this new forum\r\nfor cooperation, we Ibero-Americans must strengthen our\r\ncommitment to the successful convening of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, an initiative of the Chilean\r\nGovernment supported enthusiastically by Honduras, and\r\nwhich we hope will be given a final impetus by this General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThere can be no doubt that all of these attempts to\r\nachieve prosperity for our nations must inevitably involve a\r\nwillingness on the part of the industrialized States to include\r\nus in trying to establish an open, multilateral trade system\r\nthat gives our products greater access to competitive markets\r\nso that more and more countries can reach satisfactory levels\r\nof growth and trade.\r\nUnfortunately, the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade\r\nNegotiations has not yet been concluded, and this is a source\r\nof grave concern to the less developed States whose\r\nexpectations are affected along with the programmes of\r\nstructural adjustment they are carrying out with great\r\nsacrifice, as an effective contribution to a better ordering of\r\nthe world economy. Protectionist measures imposed by\r\ncertain States on exports from our region not only cause a\r\ndecline in the prices of those products but also impede\r\naccess to international markets, thus helping to plunge our\r\neconomies into a climate of uncertainty by restricting the\r\npossibilities of investment and continued growth.\r\nThe need to achieve greater global economic stability\r\nwithout regard to the economic and political might of any\r\nindividual nation should be examined along with the growing\r\nconvergence of opinions concerning global priorities with\r\nregard to the environment; this was demonstrated in a clear\r\nand positive way at the Earth Summit held at Rio de Janeiro\r\nlast year.\r\nThe deterioration of nature must be avoided. Together\r\nwe can design preservation strategies that also make it\r\npossible to make rational use of our natural resources in\r\norder to meet our countries’ requirements for employment\r\nneeds and economic growth. In Honduras, we have\r\nestablished a Ministry of the Environment charged with\r\ndesigning policies and strategies aimed at creating\r\nmechanisms to protect and preserve our ecosystem and its\r\nendangered species of flora and fauna.\r\nLastly, as regards the restructuring of the United\r\nNations, Honduras supports the proposal that the Security\r\nCouncil be expanded to include new permanent and non-\r\npermanent members so as to reflect the realities of today’s\r\nworld, allowing for the rotation of membership and an\r\nequitable geographical distribution in the composition of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe are also in favour of the revitalization of the United\r\nNations in the economic, social, cultural and related spheres.\r\nIt is essential that the necessary measures be adopted as soon\r\nas possible to strengthen the capacity of those organs\r\nconcerned in order to discharge the functions conferred upon\r\nthem by the Charter of the United Nations in the sphere of\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nWe welcome the steps that have already been taken to\r\nachieve the objectives we have set, but we believe that we\r\nneed to arrive at a more effective and more economical\r\nUnited Nations system, one which is at the same time less\r\npassive in executing the programmes adopted here.\r\nThe emergence of new conflicts and the persistence of\r\nold ones in different parts of the world reconfirm, if such a\r\nthing is necessary, the proven wisdom of trying to achieve,\r\nas we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, an integral structure of harmonization and peaceful\r\ncooperation for the international community. Let us pledge\r\nto achieve this with our votes and our actions.\r\nMr. DE MOURA (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): First of all, Sir,\r\non behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola and\r\non my own behalf, I congratulate Ambassador Insanally\r\n48 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nwarmly on his unanimous election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. I am\r\nconvinced that his proven experience and dedication to the\r\nnoble ideals of our Organization constitute a secure\r\nguarantee of the success of this session.\r\nTo Mr. Stoyan Ganev, his predecessor, I should like to\r\nexpress my sincere gratitude for his exemplary and unselfish\r\nmanner of directing the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly. The results we obtained during that session are\r\nundeniable testimony to his valiant contribution in the search\r\nfor just and lasting solutions to the grave problems with\r\nwhich we are confronted.\r\nWe are very pleased to welcome the new Members of\r\nour Organization. Their admission confirms the universal\r\nvocation of the United Nations at a time when its actions are\r\nfelt all over the world.\r\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nI also want to express my Government’s satisfaction at the\r\ndevotion and energy he has shown during the first year of\r\nhis difficult mandate, whose principal objective was the\r\nconstant search for adequate solutions to the problems that\r\nafflict all mankind. We would not be wrong to say that\r\nunder his leadership concrete and decisive steps have already\r\nbeen taken towards the resolution of certain issues that\r\nseemed too difficult to resolve.\r\nIn this context we salute his efforts, within the\r\nframework of the restructuring and revitalization of the\r\nUnited Nations system, to give the system a new vitality in\r\nthe fulfilment of its mission. We also support the\r\nmechanisms established for the prevention of conflict, as\r\nexplained in the report entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\",\r\nwhose sub-title includes the words \"Preventive diplomacy\".\r\nMy Government continues to support such initiatives and\r\ncommends the United Nations for the General Assembly’s\r\nunanimous adoption of resolution 47/120 B at its forty-\r\nseventh session on 20 September 1993.\r\nTherefore, the restructuring and revitalization of our\r\nOrganization should include reform of the Security Council\r\nso that it can respond to the realities of today’s world. We\r\nunderstand that restructuring the Security Council -\r\nspecifically its enlargement - so that it can permit equitable\r\nrepresentation of all the regions of the globe is aimed at\r\nguaranteeing greater representativeness, credibility and\r\nefficiency. We think that the time has come for the defence\r\nof peace and international security to be the responsibility of\r\nall States.\r\nSignificant and far-reaching achievements have occurred\r\nand are still occurring in international relations, after the end\r\nof the East-West confrontation and the cold war. These\r\nevents are taking place in spite of the proliferation of armed\r\nconflicts that put at risk the hope for peace and stability,\r\nconditions that are indispensable for the promotion of\r\nmutually advantageous international cooperation.\r\nWith the signing of the peace accords in Washington\r\nbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the\r\nGovernment of Israel, a new era has opened up for the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East. My Government commends the\r\nsigning of these accords and hopes that the international\r\ncommunity will continue to work for the rights of all the\r\npeople of that region, in particular so that the opportunity for\r\nthe Palestinian people to live in peace and freedom will be\r\nan irreversible reality.\r\nRegarding South Africa, it was with great satisfaction\r\nthat we heard, in the speech by Mr. Nelson Mandela in this\r\nHall on 24 September 1993, the announcement of the\r\norganization of free and democratic elections in April 1994\r\nand the call for the lifting of the sanctions. We also\r\ncommend the creation of the Transitional Executive Council,\r\nwhich will put an end to three centuries of white minority\r\ndomination. From this rostrum, my Government would like\r\nto add its voice in support of all the initiatives that aim for\r\na peaceful and negotiated solution in South Africa for the\r\npeaceful transition of power to the black majority.\r\nIn this context, my Government hopes that the\r\ninternational community will remain vigilant in order to\r\ndeter any attempt by extremist groups to derail the present\r\ndemocratic process, which will culminate in the\r\nestablishment of the right to one man, one vote, in South\r\nAfrica.\r\nWhile there has been encouraging progress with regard\r\nto the conflicts in the Middle East and apartheid, it is\r\nunfortunate that the same is not true in relation to other\r\nconflicts, such as those in East Timor, the former\r\nYugoslavia, some States of the former Soviet Union,\r\nSomalia, Liberia and my own country. As a matter of fact,\r\nthese conflicts and civil wars continue daily to kill thousands\r\nof human beings and to impede the social and economic\r\ndevelopment of the countries involved. We should like the\r\ninternational community, and the United Nations in\r\nparticular, to give more attention to the resolution of these\r\nconflicts, on the basis of international justice and legality.\r\nI should like to express our solidarity with, and\r\nencouragement to, the Government of Mozambique and our\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 49\r\nMozambican brothers and sisters, so that they may, with\r\ndetermination and patience, continue on the paths that will\r\nlead that country to a lasting and peaceful solution within the\r\nframework of the accords signed in Rome, whose\r\nimplementation should be scrupulously observed by all\r\ninterested parties, under the supervision of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe welcome the positive signs which resulted from the\r\nrecent meeting regarding East Timor between the Ministers\r\nof Foreign Trade of Portugal and Indonesia, under the\r\nauspices of the Secretary-General.\r\nWe hope that this profitable dialogue will lead to a just\r\nsolution that takes into account the aspirations of the\r\nMaubere people in accordance with the relevant resolutions\r\nof the General Assembly and of the Security Council.\r\nWith regard to Western Sahara, my Government\r\nsupports the holding of the referendum on self-determination\r\nfor this Territory under the terms of the resolutions of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and of the United Nations.\r\nMy Government also hopes that the existing obstacles will\r\nbe overcome as soon as possible.\r\nThere have lately been startling changes in the world\r\neconomic situation. This applies especially to third world\r\ncountries, particularly in Africa. In this regard, while we\r\nwitness almost linear economic growth in the developed\r\ncountries, a substantial decrease has been recorded in the\r\nless developed countries.\r\nThe indebtedness and the debt servicing of the less\r\ndeveloped countries, together with the great decrease in the\r\nprices of raw materials and the recession in the industrialized\r\ncountries, constitute the principal obstacle to their\r\ndevelopment and to their full participation in the world\r\neconomy.\r\nIn summary, it may be said that the socio-economic\r\nsituation of the developing countries - in particular, the\r\ncountries of Africa - is alarming and requires the assistance\r\nof international financial institutions.\r\nNevertheless, we are opposed to the doctrine that has\r\nbeen termed the états en échec - the failed States - according\r\nto which these countries are not able to resolve their\r\nproblems by themselves and, therefore, need new \"tutors\".\r\nIt seems to us important that certain political situations\r\nthat are a legacy of the past be revised with a view to\r\nreaching agreement and reducing the great barriers that exist\r\nand the mechanisms that jeopardize real cooperation for the\r\neconomic, technical and scientific advancement of the\r\ndeveloping countries. In this context, we propose a\r\nrestructuring of the mechanism of international management\r\nfor economic development and cooperation.\r\nMy Government shares the opinion that a successful\r\noutcome to the forthcoming world conferences on economic\r\nand social development and on population is of great\r\nimportance to the international community so that there may\r\nbe, at the highest level, an open and frank dialogue with a\r\nview to finding the most equitable solutions to the most\r\ndiverse and burning issues concerning mankind: poverty,\r\nhunger and malnutrition - in a word, \"underdevelopment\" -\r\nthat grip a great part of our planet.\r\nI should like to refer also to the importance that my\r\nGovernment attaches to environmental issues and the\r\nattention that it pays to implementation of the\r\nrecommendations and decisions of the Rio Conference of\r\n1992. In this context, the Government of Angola has\r\nestablished the post of Secretary of State for the\r\nEnvironment, whose purpose is to apply the\r\nrecommendations and decisions of the Rio Conference. In\r\naddition, an inter-ministerial commission, with an essentially\r\nconsultative role, has been set up to study and follow closely\r\nprojects related to the activities of the United Nations\r\nEconomic and Social Council’s Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe promotion of and universal respect for human\r\nrights remain the prerequisites for the strengthening of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe Republic of Angola actively participated in the\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights, which was held in\r\nVienna, and supported the consensus view. Nevertheless,\r\nAngola continues to believe that, in the broad sense, human\r\nrights are universal. We believe that there must be no\r\nselectivity in the observance of human rights. Nowhere\r\nshould human rights serve as a pretext for interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of sovereign States Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe world and the United Nations have witnessed the\r\nevolution of the political situation in my country in recent\r\nyears - in particular, since 1988. To make possible a better\r\nunderstanding of the phenomena that have contributed to the\r\ndramatic situation in Angola, allow me to provide a brief\r\nhistorical overview.\r\n50 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe Angolan Government is ever-conscious of the\r\nintrinsic link between peace and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, not just for Angola but for all of southern\r\nAfrica. My Government took the initiative of presenting a\r\npeace programme to the then Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations. This programme contained the principles\r\nthat culminated in the signing of the Accords in New York\r\nin December 1988. We recall that these accords provided\r\nfor the withdrawal of Cuban soldiers from Angola and their\r\nreturn to Cuba, as well as for the withdrawal of the apartheid\r\nforces from Angolan territory and the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978) concerning the\r\nindependence of Namibia. At that time the international\r\ncommunity greeted with satisfaction the New York Accords,\r\nwhich opened a new era in the relations between States in\r\nthat region.\r\nWith regard to the internal conflict in Angola, the\r\nGovernment was aware of the fact that only domestic peace,\r\nachieved through dialogue and political mediation, would\r\nmake possible the creation of a favourable framework for a\r\nsolution of the conflict. Apart from its own efforts, the\r\nGovernment showed that it was sensitive to African\r\ninitiatives that sought to contribute to the restoration of\r\npeace in Angola.\r\nThus it was that, in the framework of the Government’s\r\ninternal peace plan, we arrived in Gbadolite in June 1989.\r\nUnfortunately, the Accords lasted only a short time because\r\nUNITA’s friends and allies wanted a different solution. The\r\nfailure of the Accords was due essentially to bad faith on the\r\npart of the head of UNITA.\r\nIn spite of this failure, the Angolan Government\r\ncontinued to commit itself to economic and political reforms,\r\nas well as to a negotiated solution of the conflict. It\r\ncontinued to promote genuine national reconciliation, whose\r\nfundamental purpose was to put an end to the conflict with\r\nUNITA.\r\nAfter New York and Gbadolite, peace negotiations\r\ncontinued - the Portuguese Government mediating - and the\r\nBicesse Accords were signed on 31 May 1991. After a\r\nperiod of 18 months, during which the Angolan people lived\r\nin relative peace, the country’s first multi-party elections\r\nwere held on 29 and 30 September 1992.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, the United Nations\r\nconsidered these elections to be to be free and fair.\r\nUNITA was not satisfied with the defeat that the\r\nAngolan people had inflicted on it through the ballot-box,\r\nand once again showed its Fascist character. It did not\r\nhesitate to take up arms again to take power by force. It\r\nresumed its previous role as a militarist organization\r\nincapable of conforming to democratic rules.\r\nJonas Savimbi’s military option plunged our country\r\ninto a civil war that has caused incalculable loss of human\r\nlives, the destruction of social and economic infrastructure\r\nand the displacement of millions of citizens, with such\r\nconsequences as hunger, poverty, sickness and lack of proper\r\nclothing.\r\nAs we stated in the Security Council on 15 September\r\n1993, the situation in Angola is exceptionally tragic and\r\nrequires special attention from the international community.\r\nDaily, thousands of people die as a direct or indirect\r\nconsequence of the war. Children, elderly people and\r\nwomen are direct victims of these acts of war. We can\r\ndeclare, without fear of contradiction, that the critical\r\neconomic and political situation in Angola today bears no\r\nsimilarity whatever to the situation in Somalia, Bosnia,\r\nCambodia or any of the republics of the former Soviet\r\nUnion. It is our profound hope that peace will be restored\r\nto those regions.\r\nThe international community seems insensitive to our\r\ntragedy. It is as if the Angolan people were paying the price\r\nfor playing the democratic game. Indeed, how are we to\r\nunderstand the curtain of silence that envelops my country?\r\nA poor loser will not hesitate to defy the international\r\ncommunity with impunity unless it punishes him once and\r\nfor all. How can one explain that UNITA still maintains\r\noffices in certain democratic countries and that some of its\r\nofficials are still received with great pomp by officials who\r\ndo not hide their aversion to totalitarianism and are the most\r\nardent defenders of human rights?\r\nOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of\r\nAngola and of its martyred people, who are dying daily by\r\nthe thousands, I appeal to the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community from this rostrum to help my people\r\nand compel the UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi, once and for\r\nall to abandon his military adventurism and respect the will\r\nof the Angolan people, as freely expressed at the ballot\r\nboxes in September 1992.\r\nSpeaking to the Security Council last week during its\r\nconsideration of the evolving situation in Angola, we asked\r\nourselves how long that great organ, responsible for\r\ninternational peace and security, would permit the leader of\r\nUNITA to perpetrate with impunity heinous massacres that\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 51\r\nshock the human conscience. These acts discredit and\r\ndishonour the United Nations itself and the Security Council,\r\nwhose resolutions have been purely and simply ignored. We\r\nwould like to remind this Assembly that since the beginning\r\nof the war in Angola in October 1992 the Security Council\r\nhas adopted 10 resolutions condemning UNITA and\r\ndemanding that it abandon the military option and resume\r\ndialogue aimed at restoring peace.\r\nYet UNITA has met neither demand. Worse yet, in\r\nreaction to Security Council resolution 864 (1993) of 15\r\nSeptember 1993, which provides for the imposition of\r\nsanctions, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi attempted once\r\nagain to dupe international public opinion and the Security\r\nCouncil by declaring a false cease-fire and stipulating\r\nconditions at variance with the spirit and letter of the\r\nBicesse Accords, the Abidjan Protocol and the electoral\r\nresults.\r\nThe truth, however, is quite different. Not only was the\r\nunilateral cease-fire declared by UNITA not respected, but\r\nwe witnessed an increase in military operations throughout\r\nour national territory. As a result, fighting in Kuito and\r\nother regions has recently intensified in a desperate UNITA\r\nattempt to reoccupy new areas and consolidate its position.\r\nMoreover, by making new proposals outside the negotiating\r\nframework, Savimbi revealed his obvious intention to ignore\r\nthe resolutions of the Security Council and seize power for\r\nhimself at any cost, including the death of hundreds of\r\nthousands more Angolans. Savimbi does not want peace\r\nwithout power. Savimbi only wishes to gain time.\r\nObviously, the Government of Angola cannot accept the\r\npolicy of fait accompli that UNITA wishes to implement by\r\nproposing a cease-fire in situ. We believe that there is no\r\ngood will on UNITA’s part and that it does not wish to\r\nestablish dialogue to put a definitive end to the war. This\r\narmed party is plotting a dangerous manoeuvre with the aim\r\nof shirking its obligation to fulfil the Bicesse Accords and\r\nthe resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nThe United Nations has a great responsibility in the\r\nAngolan process and must not be complacent as regards\r\nUNITA. It is important that the prestige of this Organization\r\nin the peaceful settlement of the conflict not be jeopardized\r\nor challenged by the irreverence of the leader of a rebel\r\npolitical organization. The Government of Angola, the\r\nUnited Nations and the troika of observers of the Angolan\r\npeace process have all fallen victim in succession to\r\nUNITA’s bad faith over the past 12 months, a bad faith that\r\nhas characterized the behaviour of Mr. Savimbi in every\r\nmeeting held since the Namibe, Addis Ababa and Abidjan\r\nmeetings.\r\nIn Abidjan the Angolan Government bent over\r\nbackwards to be flexible. In spite of the involvement of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representative\r\nand of the leaders of the delegations of the observer States,\r\nUNITA did not sign the Protocol of Understanding which\r\nwas negotiated and agreed upon to lead to the establishment\r\nof a complete cease-fire in Angola. We would like to point\r\nout that President Houphouët-Boigny and his Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs have done their best in the search for a just\r\nsolution to the Angolan conflict. These efforts have not\r\nbeen successful, due solely to the obstinacy of Mr. Savimbi,\r\nwho says \"Yes\" one day and \"No\" the next.\r\nWe therefore consider that it is crucial that the\r\ninternational community identify the transgressor and move\r\nvigorously against him in Angola in an act of justice towards\r\nour people and Government, so that our hopes for the\r\nestablishment of democracy will not be frustrated in the\r\nmidst of the transitional process currently taking place\r\nthroughout the world. We want a lasting peace based on\r\nviable conditions for reconciling all Angolans.\r\nIn that context, my Government proposed, on 22\r\nSeptember 1993, the following conditions to resolve the\r\npost-electoral crisis caused by UNITA.\r\nFirst, UNITA must withdraw its military forces from\r\nthe areas they occupied illegally following the multi-party\r\nelections held on 29 and 30 September 1992, and must then\r\nobserve the cease-fire under the terms of Security Council\r\n851 (1993) of 15 July 1993.\r\nSecondly, after the declaration of a cease-fire,\r\nhumanitarian assistance should be implemented and the\r\nurgent evacuation of the wounded, sick, interested persons\r\nand foreigners accomplished.\r\nThirdly, UNITA must accept fully and unequivocally\r\nthe validity of the Bicesse Accords and the results of the\r\nelection held in September 1992.\r\nFourthly, UNITA must respect the legislation produced\r\nby the instruments of sovereignty established by the\r\nelections.\r\nThe Angolan Government reiterates its willingness to\r\nresume negotiations as soon as the conditions for those\r\nnegotiations have been established.\r\n52 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn my statement to the Security Council on 15\r\nSeptember 1993 I alerted its members to the crimes\r\ncommitted by UNITA against defenceless civilian\r\npopulations. These crimes range from the cold-blooded\r\nmurder of medical personnel and hospital patients, and the\r\nhunting down and physical elimination of journalists, family\r\nmembers of Government officials and UNITA dissidents to\r\nthe bombardment of cities by long-range guns and missiles.\r\nI also had the opportunity to discuss the situation prevailing\r\nin some regions of Angola, where, as in Kuito, the\r\npopulation has had to eat the flesh of human corpses in\r\norder to survive. UNITA has encircled Kuito for more than\r\neight months and does not allow humanitarian assistance to\r\nbe distributed to the population or allow foreigners to leave\r\nthe areas in which they found themselves when the war\r\nresumed.\r\nIn Somalia, one warlord, General Mohammed Aidid,\r\nhas been labelled an undesirable person by the United\r\nNations. An international arrest warrant was issued for that\r\nSomali leader. Several days ago the General Assembly\r\nelected a group of international jurists whose mandate is to\r\njudge those accused of war crimes allegedly committed in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia. And what is to be said of Jonas\r\nSavimbi?\r\nAre the crimes that are being committed in Angola\r\nunder Mr. Savimbi’s order not worse than those which the\r\nUnited Nations has attributed to General Aidid or the crimes\r\nthat it intends to judge in the former Yugoslavia? The\r\nmurder of medical personnel and patients in hospitals; the\r\nhunting down and execution of journalists; family members\r\nof Government leaders and dissidents from UNITA, Jonas\r\nSavimbi’s organization; the incineration of political\r\nadversaries in huge bonfires; the indiscriminate\r\nbombardment of cities with long-range guns and missiles;\r\nand UNITA’s ties with the forces of apartheid - what does\r\nall this mean? Are these not crimes against humanity?\r\nThe sanctions that the Security Council decreed and\r\nwhich entered into force on 25 September constitute proof\r\nof the commitment of the international community to the\r\nAngolan conflict. We hope that these signs will be\r\nhonoured by Mr. Savimbi and his allies so that dialogue can\r\nbe resumed as soon as possible, on the basis of the Bicesse\r\nAccords, the Abidjan Protocol and on fulfilment of\r\nparagraphs 6 and 12 of Security Council resolution 851\r\n(1993).\r\nIn conclusion, I should like once again, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Angola, to express our\r\nprofound gratitude for the wide range of support the\r\ninternational community has provided to alleviate the\r\nsuffering of our people. We hope this assistance will\r\ncontinue in an even more substantial way. We wish to pay\r\nhere a special debt of gratitude to the humanitarian\r\norganizations and in particular the World Food Programme,\r\nwhich, in spite of UNITA’s irresponsible and criminal\r\nactions, has continued its operations, risking the lives of its\r\nown personnel.\r\nWe express also our gratitude to the countries that in\r\ndiverse ways have given humanitarian assistance to the\r\npeople, who still are in need of it now.\r\nOnce again, I wish the President every success in the\r\nwork of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly\r\nand hope that its results will contribute to the strengthening\r\nof international peace and cooperation.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe general debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. RICHARDSON (United Kingdom): I regret\r\nhaving to make an intervention at this late hour, but I\r\npromise you it will not take 10 minutes.\r\nIn his statement earlier this evening, the Foreign\r\nMinister of Argentina referred to the alleged sovereign rights\r\nof his country over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and\r\nthe South Sandwich Islands. I must repeat that the British\r\nGovernment has no doubts about its sovereignty over the\r\nBritish dependencies in the South Atlantic. My Government\r\nwill continue to work with the Government of Argentina to\r\ncreate an atmosphere of stability and cooperation in the\r\nSouth Atlantic. Considerable progress has been made.\r\nWe look forward to resuming negotiations in the near\r\nfuture with the Government of Argentina on a new\r\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 53\r\nagreement on fishing. I must, however, add that the\r\nprogress which has been achieved is predicated on the\r\nunderstanding that sovereignty is not a matter we are\r\nprepared to discuss.\r\nMr. RICARDES (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Republic of Argentina, having taken note of\r\nthe comments made by the delegation of the United\r\nKingdom, wishes to reaffirm the comments made by the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of our country,\r\nMr. Guido di Tella, in his statement this afternoon.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.20 p.m.\r\n"
