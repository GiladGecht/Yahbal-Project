"United Nations\r\nG E N E R A L\r\nA S S E M B L Y\r\nFORTY-EIGHTH SESSION\r\nOfficial Records\r\n8th\r\nPLENARY MEETING\r\n29 September 1993\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nNEW YORK\r\nPresident: Mr. INSANALLY\r\n(Guyana)\r\n__________\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. JUAN CARLOS WASMOSY,\r\nPRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay.\r\nMr. Juan Carlos Wasmosy, President of the Republic\r\nof Paraguay, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic\r\nof Paraguay, His Excellency Mr. Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and\r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident WASMOSY (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThis is the first occasion on which I have had the honour to\r\nappear before this lofty international body to speak on behalf\r\nof my country, Paraguay. I do so with the profound\r\nsatisfaction of representing a genuinely democratic\r\nGovernment that has emerged from free elections, and as the\r\nfirst civilian citizen who has held the presidency of the\r\nRepublic in 39 years.\r\nI wish to congratulate you, President Insanally. Your\r\nelection, based on your solid professional knowledge and\r\nyour long political career, is a tribute to you personally and\r\nto your country, Guyana, which you so worthily represent.\r\nI am pleased to recall in this context that Paraguay, since it\r\nentered the United Nations as a founding Member in 1945,\r\nhas always championed the right to the self-determination of\r\npeoples and the independence of political communities\r\nwhich, like Guyana, came to self-government in fulfilment\r\nof the obligations imposed by the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI welcome very warmly the new Members that have\r\njust been admitted: the Czech Republic, the Republic of\r\nSlovakia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,\r\nEritrea, the Principality of Monaco, and Andorra. This\r\nwelcome is not simply a matter of protocol; it involves the\r\nrecognition of their respective Governments that I am\r\nexpressing on behalf of the Paraguayan Government.\r\nA little more than a month ago I inaugurated my\r\nGovernment with the firm resolve to strengthen our foreign\r\nrelations with all the members of the international\r\ncommunity, within the natural limitations set by domestic\r\nfinancial circumstances and contingencies. I would now\r\nventure to offer some thoughts for the consideration of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe new world order broke suddenly upon the world.\r\nThe bipolar structure of power has now ceased to exist, and\r\nthe change has taken place peacefully. Paraguay has\r\nchanged in the same way and with the same rhythm. Today\r\nthe Paraguayan people is the champion of its own destiny\r\nand the will of the people prevails. We live in a condition\r\nof respect for human rights, a market economy and State\r\nreform. We have successfully and peacefully carried out\r\nextraordinary reforms in the political, economic and social\r\nfields without external assistance, relying solely on our\r\ncitizens’ faith and aspiration to live in peace, with justice\r\nand freedom.\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86629 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.8\r\n11 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe Government of Paraguay respects freedom and\r\npromotes justice; it is striving to widen the opportunities for\r\nhuman development and well-being.\r\nEconomic activity, and in particular the market\r\neconomy, cannot exist in an institutional vacuum. On the\r\ncontrary, a security system must be established that ensures\r\nthe fiscal integrity of all persons, individual initiative and the\r\ninviolability of private property, through a stable monetary\r\nsystem and efficient public services.\r\nThe priority of the Paraguayan Government is to\r\nguarantee this security, this stability and these services, so\r\nthat those who wish to work and produce can enjoy the\r\nfruits of their labour and feel motivated to do their work\r\nhonestly and efficiently.\r\nThe Paraguayan people is now aware that it has\r\ntriumphed over its many vicissitudes. We have heard many\r\npromises about the advent of the new man. We have\r\nwitnessed many tragedies and dashed hopes.\r\nToday, we believe that the only path towards the great\r\ntriumphs of collective well-being is that of democracy and\r\nfreedom. The men and women of Paraguay wish to live in\r\ntheir own way, respecting the law and prospering in\r\nharmony and concord.\r\nI would consider my activities of strengthening and\r\nconsolidating democracy incomplete if in future my\r\ncompatriots could not continue freely to form political\r\nparties and to elect governments without coercion, if they\r\ncould not live in peace with their families and enjoy the\r\nhonest fruits of their work, if they could not live fruitful\r\nlives and at the end of their days reflect proudly on their\r\nsuccesses and achievements.\r\nBut as we view the Paraguayan future, we must reflect\r\non a situation fraught with dramatic realities. We have\r\novercome a domestic political situation which for three\r\ndecades had been met with indifference, marginalization and,\r\nultimately, condemnation by the international community.\r\nWe endured that situation because of the labour the\r\ningenuity and the great sacrifice of the Paraguayan people.\r\nToday we must consolidate our victory and institutionalize\r\ndemocracy as the only possible choice.\r\nWe have run into two main obstacles to the attainment\r\nof that objective: an increasing rate of population growth\r\nand a lack of resources to finance our development with the\r\nrapidity required by the rapid increase in our population and\r\nthe pressing need to raise the standard of living and the\r\nwell-being of all Paraguayans.\r\nWe believe that we must be able to count on the\r\ncooperation of the industrialized countries in order to ensure\r\nthe continued primacy of the values we share with the\r\ncommunity of nations.\r\nTo accelerate our development we call for an extension\r\nof the magnificent collaboration of the United Nations\r\nsystem and its many institutions, such as the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, which now has a new, dynamic\r\nAdministrator and in which the developing countries place\r\ngreat hopes; the effective traditional programme of the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund, which champions the rights\r\nof children and adolescents; and the United Nations Fund for\r\nPopulation Activities, which plays a very important role in\r\nregard to the crucial question of population.\r\nWe call also on the specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system - each of which has in its field greatly\r\nassisted in our countries’ development plans - to redouble\r\ntheir efforts, increase their effectiveness by means of greater\r\ncreativity, and lower their expenditures by exercising greater\r\ncontrol.\r\nThis cooperation should go hand in hand with domestic\r\nefforts to attract assistance on favourable terms and greater\r\nflows of private foreign investment.\r\nThe financial institutions, especially the World Bank\r\nand the Inter-American Development Bank, should speed up\r\ntheir assistance by reducing their bureaucracies and should\r\nprovide the fullest possible support to developing countries’\r\nprojects and programmes. We recognize the great assistance\r\nthey have provided in the past, and we urge them to exceed\r\neven their past achievements in order to ensure a better\r\nfuture for all our countries. If the developing countries do\r\nnot receive such cooperation, the consequence will be, on the\r\none hand, a prosperous and democratic world with freedom\r\nand an abundance of goods for all and, on the other, a world\r\ncorroded by ignorance, poverty and the enslavement of the\r\npoor. It will be difficult for democracy to survive if poverty\r\npersists.\r\nEstablishing economic progress with equity in Paraguay\r\nmeans strengthening democracy. My greatest desire as Head\r\nof State is to establish the democratic system once and for\r\nall in my country.\r\nIn order to achieve that aim, my Government will act\r\nvery responsibly, ensuring that its administration does not\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 3\r\nengage in irregularities, and it will be very strict in enforcing\r\nthe law. We wish to have the greatest possible transparency\r\nin the whole of the governmental process, in both domestic\r\nand international affairs.\r\nWe believe that the stability of democratic countries\r\nlies, among other things, in the integrity of their civil\r\nservants, in the independence of the judiciary, in individual\r\nand collective security, and in the State’s efficiency in\r\npromoting development. That is why my Government will\r\npursue and punish anyone who engages in corruption. In\r\nthat way we intend to eradicate corruption.\r\nWe have undertaken to fulfil these purposes in the\r\ncertainty that the international community will be prepared\r\nto support us in so doing.\r\nNationalistic passions have flared up in many parts of\r\nthe world, challenging borders and jeopardizing international\r\ncoexistence. Age-old conflicts still seethe, as can be seen\r\nfrom the terrible bloodshed, and havoc in former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe United Nations has set up more peace-keeping missions\r\nin the last three years than it did in its first 45 years of\r\nexistence.\r\nAt the same time as we are witnessing these events\r\nwith distress and sorrow, we are rejoicing in the signing of\r\nthe statement of principles between the Government of Israel\r\nand the Palestine Liberation Organization. This valuable\r\ncontribution to world peace is due to the courage and the\r\nclear-sightedness of the leaders on both sides, who have\r\nbeen able to overcome the burden of ancestral prejudice to\r\nenter into a new harmonious relationship. We also applaud\r\nthe participation of countries as mediators in these\r\nnegotiations. They all deserve the world’s admiration.\r\nMy Government believes that, in compliance with the\r\nSan Francisco Charter, the Organization will accept as\r\nMembers all those States that fulfil the requirements set out\r\nin the Charter.\r\nWe congratulate the United Nations on the tremendous\r\nwork that is being done in its peace missions. This\r\ndemonstrates not just that the Organization is alert to the\r\nneed to find a solution where any event may cause a breach\r\nof the peace but also that, in doing so, it tries to realize the\r\nhope of peace for suffering peoples, meeting their basic\r\nneeds and alleviating their difficulties.\r\nThe peace to which we aspire cannot come from sterile\r\nimmobility or from armed respite. It cannot be imposed. It\r\nmust be dynamic, sincere and generous and must be based\r\non the principles of solidarity between nations.\r\nLet me refer to a contribution from my country,\r\nreflected in our universal feeling of friendship. A few years\r\nago, in a small town called Pinasco, a doctor who was a\r\ndistinguished member of the community proposed that 30\r\nJuly be designated as a day dedicated to friendship. This\r\nidea spread throughout the Latin American continent and to\r\nother regions of the world. For this reason I am pleased to\r\nsuggest that the United Nations adopt that date as the world\r\nday of friendship.\r\nEvents are giving rise to a higher and higher level of\r\nworld and regional interdependence. With the Treaty on the\r\nIntegration of the Common Market in the Southern Cone,\r\nknown as MERCOSUR, we in the southern cone -\r\nArgentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - are seeking an\r\nimprovement in our economies.\r\nThe purpose of MERCOSUR is to harmonize\r\neconomies, to reach better and broader understandings with\r\nother economic groups through the provision of mutual\r\nfacilities. We hope that the negotiations that have begun\r\nwith the European Economic Community, the future North\r\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Asia-\r\nPacific countries will bear fruit.\r\nParaguay gives its fullest support to the creation of this\r\nCommon Market of the South. We hope fervently that there\r\nwill be frank and full cooperation in all the negotiations\r\nbetween the four countries involved. All our actions should\r\nbe really consistent with our aims. It is our sincere desire\r\nthat we may reach an understanding that is just and fair and\r\nof benefit to everyone.\r\nWhile dealing with economic affairs, I should like also\r\nto express our desire and hope that full agreement will be\r\nreached in the Uruguay Round negotiations. We hope that\r\nthe markets will open up increasingly. We wish to see trade\r\nflowing more freely, without any tariff or other barriers and\r\nwithout subsidies, which undermine the competitiveness of\r\nour MERCOSUR products.\r\nWe fully support the principle of free trade. One\r\ncannot hamper trade by protectionism while professing belief\r\nin the principle of free trade.\r\nI have just visited Bolivia, a sister country with which\r\nwe have signed joint agreements and I made an offer to its\r\nGovernment that Paraguay would serve as a link for its entry\r\ninto MERCOSUR. I also requested that they themselves, in\r\ntheir turn, shall serve as a link between MERCOSUR and\r\nthe Andean Pact. Through the system of MERCOSUR and\r\nthrough the Andean Pact, we have established a fresh and,\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nwe hope, promising arrangement. Today - 29 September -\r\nwe commemorate the battle of Boquerón, a symbol of the\r\nvalour of both peoples which we hope will be a landmark\r\nfor the future in our search for cooperation, understanding\r\nand peace.\r\nThis new era represents a challenge in relations\r\nbetween nations. In the process of the globalization of\r\neconomies, countries must avoid selfishness. They must\r\nshare their prosperity and technological advances in order to\r\nensure effective progress for all mankind. The European\r\nCommunity, the NAFTA countries and the Asia-Pacific\r\ncountries should be a dynamic force in economic relations,\r\nand should not set new limitations on world trade.\r\nInternational coexistence requires that we seek to\r\nestablish mutually supportive understandings and agreements\r\nthat will strengthen the collective economy and, thus, every\r\ncountry’s individual economy.\r\nNorth America provides a very promising example of\r\nthis. Mexico, Canada and the United States are proposing\r\na zone of free trade between countries that have different\r\ncultures, histories, languages and lifestyles. In spite of these\r\ndifferences they have taken a praiseworthy decision to make\r\ntheir economies complementary.\r\nNAFTA represents an undertaking to ensure shared\r\nprosperity through collective arrangements. As we enter a\r\nnew century, these three countries realize that economic\r\nprosperity depends, as never before, on the opening of new\r\nmarkets across the world and increasing the volume of world\r\ntrade. We hope that when this arrangement is established it\r\nwill be of great benefit to the whole of Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean.\r\nEconomic development should not run counter to the\r\npreservation and protection of the environment. Both\r\nconcepts are valid for everyone, irrespective of differences\r\nin countries’ levels of economic development.\r\nEnvironmental degradation will continue if we keep on\r\napplying such ambiguous criteria as \"environmental\r\nconditionality\". The great meeting on the environment held\r\nat Rio in 1992, after very lengthy deliberations, points us in\r\nthe direction of \"sustainable development\" - development\r\nthat can be made compatible with protection of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nWe need to fulfil the agreement that was reached at\r\nRio. We must not go back on the commitments undertaken\r\nthere. Neither should there be double standards - different\r\nstandards for industrialized and for developing countries.\r\nThe latter need the cooperation that was promised at that\r\nmemorable international meeting.\r\nWith regard to social problems on a world scale, drug\r\ntrafficking threatens the economic and political stability of\r\nsome countries. In this area too the United Nations should\r\ntake the lead in order to combat the scourge of drugs, with\r\nall its disastrous consequences for young people and the\r\nmoney laundering and terrorism that are its ramifications.\r\nParaguay is totally committed to the battle against drug\r\ntrafficking, the money laundering resulting from it and all\r\nthe other crimes that are associated with drugs. This\r\nstruggle requires total international cooperation if drug\r\ntrafficking is to be eliminated. It has to be recognized that\r\nresponsibility for this undertaking must be shared by\r\nproducers, consumers and also intermediaries.\r\nThe United Nations is preparing for a conference in\r\n1995, which will be a special landmark in the whole of\r\ninternational coexistence. I refer to the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development that will be held in Copenhagen. The\r\nGovernment of Paraguay applauds this initiative and offers\r\nits fullest cooperation at the preparation stage and in the\r\nstudies. We are also willing to take an active part in the\r\nevent itself.\r\nInitiatives of this kind and the 1994 Cairo Conference\r\non Population and Development deserve our fullest support.\r\nAlthough, as I have said, the issues to which I referred\r\nearlier are of great significance to my country, I wish to\r\nmake the point that the raising of educational standards in\r\nmy country is my obsession. For this reason, we are trying\r\nto improve human resources so that we may make use of the\r\nnew technology which we sorely lack.\r\nEducation is not simply a commitment on the part of\r\nthe State; it is a challenge shared by all the productive\r\nsectors of the country. Technology may provide fresh\r\neconomic opportunities resulting in new sources of labour.\r\nThat is why Paraguay believes that the Bolívar\r\nProgramme is a good precedent for what can be done\r\nbetween countries determined to face the future by sharing\r\ntechnologies, innovations and industrial competitiveness.\r\nWe also hope that the industrialized countries, or those\r\nthat have achieved a high technological level, will show the\r\nnecessary will to promote the presence of their companies in\r\nour countries, so that their capital and new technology can\r\naccelerate progress in our developing countries.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 5\r\nWe shall always stress the need for a more balanced\r\ntreatment of the social and economic issues on the\r\ninternational agenda. Attention must not be given to so-\r\ncalled new global issues at the expense of the problems of\r\ndevelopment, the struggle against poverty, the defeat of\r\nignorance, and the promotion of international cooperation.\r\nAfter 48 years, men and institutions are able to concede\r\ntheir mistakes and can strengthen their convictions in order\r\nbetter to achieve their purposes. The United Nations has\r\ndemonstrated such abilities by renewing and adapting itself\r\nto the demands of our changing world. Paraguay is in\r\nfavour of this and supports the necessary reforms to adapt\r\nthe Charter to the challenges of a new age. In this way will\r\nthe United Nations be able to live up to the high ideals and\r\nhopes with which it was created.\r\nTo that purpose, it is vital that it redistribute functions\r\nand responsibilities among its bodies, increase coordination\r\nand streamline its processes. The United Nations should be\r\nthe forum for the genuine expression of the aspirations of all\r\nMember States and the primary instrument for genuine and\r\npeaceful understanding among all peoples of the world.\r\nWe must confront and settle the financial crisis which\r\nweighs so heavily on our Organization. It is not logical to\r\nassign it tasks without providing adequate means to carry\r\nthem out. Let us avoid being moved by political motives to\r\ntransform that inadequacy into administrative negligence and\r\nfinancial paralysis. Let us do the opposite - let our\r\nOrganization be the great forum of the international scene.\r\nLet it be renewed, better, more effective and more equitable.\r\nWith timely intervention, the United Nations has\r\nbrought lengthy conflicts to an end and achieved their\r\nsettlement. This praiseworthy work must be recognized and\r\nif, in some cases, the success has not been great, that has\r\nbeen due to struggles between different power centres. But\r\ntoday we are all equally ready to work to achieve more\r\neffective disarmament and to establish new international\r\nstandards for the use of nuclear energy to benefit mankind\r\nand not to destroy it. We have made considerable progress\r\nbut there remains a long way to go before we have full and\r\ncomplete security in this area. Paraguay will support a\r\ndisarmament policy as a commitment to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe continue to believe and have always maintained that\r\nthe United Nations should assume leadership, with the\r\nsupport of all Member States, in carrying out the necessary\r\nchanges to establish the rule of peace and the human\r\ndevelopment to which we all aspire.\r\nMy country wishes to underscore the outstanding work\r\nof the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to\r\nexpress its appreciation for his activities aimed at making the\r\nUnited Nations and its entire system more efficient.\r\nParaguay has faith in these positive solutions. We\r\npledge to uphold the legal principles of international\r\ncoexistence and appeal to the loftiest sentiments and the\r\nhighest sense of responsibility of all leaders of the world.\r\nMy country believes that this can be achieved and urges that\r\nit be made a reality.\r\nNo more fratricidal wars. Let us all unite in the war\r\nagainst underdevelopment, against unemployment, and\r\nagainst ignorance, which is the worst of all slaveries.\r\nReiterating our commitment to full support for the\r\nUnited Nations, we also reaffirm our resolute cooperation\r\nwith the international community and express our deepest\r\ndesire for peace, prosperity and development for all the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nI should like to conclude with a message in my native\r\nlanguage, Guaraní:\r\n\"Ja johayjhú, ñaño pytyvó, icatú haguaicha ñasé\r\nténondé oñondivepá. Aguiyéveté.\"\r\nThis means: \"Let us love one another, brothers. Let us help\r\neach other to move forward together\".\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Juan Carlos Wasmosy, President of the Republic\r\nof Paraguay, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. GUNTIS ULMANIS, PRESIDENT OF\r\nTHE REPUBLIC OF LATVIA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear\r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Latvia.\r\nMr. Guntis Ulmanis, President of the Republic of\r\nLatvia, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Latvia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Guntis Ulmanis, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident ULMANIS (spoke in Latvian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): Mr. President, please\r\naccept Latvia’s congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession. The people of Latvia wish you a successful term as\r\nleader of this body.\r\nLatvia wishes to pay its respects to those nation States\r\nwhich have recently been admitted to the United Nations and\r\nlooks forward to cooperation with them.\r\nIt has been an eventful year for Latvia. On\r\n18 November 1993, Latvia will celebrate the seventy-fifth\r\nanniversary of the declaration of independence of Latvia in\r\n1918. Our seventy-fifth year of statehood has been marked\r\nby the election and the convening of our Parliament, the\r\nSaeima. The convening of the Saeima was an especially\r\nsolemn occasion in that it meant the full restoration of\r\nparliamentary democracy and the Constitution of 1922.\r\nMoreover, the convening of the Saeima completed a\r\nthree-year restoration process that included the\r\nre-establishment of our de facto independence in August\r\n1991 and our admission to the United Nations. The\r\nre-establishment of Latvia’s independence and the restoration\r\nof its Constitution, following a half century of suspension,\r\nis testimony to the power of democracy, the endurance of\r\nthe human will and the supremacy of international law.\r\nTo understand the processes currently under way in\r\nLatvia and in our region, it is helpful to note some aspects\r\nof recent history. According to a secret protocol to the\r\nMolotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, signed by Nazi Germany\r\nand the Soviet Union, Latvia was relegated to the Soviet\r\nUnion’s sphere of influence, an act which cleared the way\r\nfor the Soviet Union’s illegal occupation of Latvia in 1940.\r\nEven though the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its secret\r\nprotocols were, under international law, void at their signing,\r\nLatvia was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union shortly\r\nafter the occupation.\r\nAlthough Latvia lost its sovereignty and independence\r\nde facto, its status as a State continued de jure. Latvia’s de\r\njure status continued to be recognized by many States, and\r\nthis position was echoed in their declarations throughout the\r\nfifty-year period of Latvia’s occupation. The continuing\r\nidentity of the State of Latvia was preserved by the\r\napplication of the principle that illegal acts cannot validly\r\nchange an existing legal situation - ex injuria non oritus jus.\r\nConsequently, when it re-established its independence in\r\nl991 Latvia was quickly able to renew diplomatic relations\r\nwith those States with which it had had such relations prior\r\nto its occupation in 1940. In addition, Latvia continues to\r\nadhere to certain bilateral and multilateral agreements to\r\nwhich it became party between 1918 and 1940.\r\nI have stressed the matter of Latvia’s continuous identity\r\nbetween 1918 and 1991 in order to emphasize that Latvia is\r\nnot a newly independent State. This fact is important\r\nbecause the de jure continuity of Latvian statehood has legal,\r\npolitical and economic consequences for Latvia, in particular\r\nwith respect to our relations with the Russian Federation.\r\nThe key to stable and friendly relations between our two\r\nStates, in both the political and economic spheres, is\r\nrecognition by both parties that Latvia was illegally and\r\nforcibly occupied and annexed in 1940 by the Soviet Union.\r\nI should like to express Latvia’s support for the various\r\nefforts by the Secretary-General and the Member States to\r\npromote the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nin particular, efforts that were initiated by the report of the\r\nSecretary-General entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nRecognizing the pragmatic and forward-looking approach of\r\nthe proposals contained in the Secretary-General’s report,\r\npreventive diplomacy in particular, we must also consider\r\nproposals that will similarly address other responsibilities of\r\nthe United Nations, including the enhancement of respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms and the promotion\r\nof sustainable development. Latvia’s experience with regard\r\nto the utilization of preventive diplomacy may be useful in\r\ndeveloping such proposals.\r\nI should like to emphasize that Latvia has utilized\r\npreventive diplomacy to the maximum extent possible.\r\nLatvia has initiated or welcomed United Nations and\r\nregionally sponsored efforts in fact-finding and confidence-\r\nbuilding in connection with the issues facing Latvia and our\r\nregion. Among these efforts is our recent agreement with\r\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to\r\nestablish a presence in Riga, our capital. These efforts have\r\nresulted in an increased understanding of the situation in\r\nLatvia, providing the United Nations, Member States and\r\nregional organizations with the knowledge and perspective\r\nto respond adequately to our problems. The\r\nSecretary-General, Member States and regional organizations\r\nhave been involved, in cooperation with Latvia, in applying\r\nthese measures to the most important and urgent matter now\r\nconfronted by Latvia - namely, the continued illegal presence\r\nof the military forces of the former Soviet Union on Latvian\r\nterritory.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 7\r\nFor over two years, Latvia has sought the removal of\r\nthe former Soviet Union’s military forces from its territory,\r\nthrough bilateral negotiations with the Russian Federation\r\nand with the assistance of the international community. Yet\r\nthese forces, now under the control of our large neighbour,\r\nthe Russian Federation, are still stationed on our territory.\r\nLast year the General Assembly addressed this issue\r\nunder the agenda item entitled \"Complete withdrawal of\r\nforeign military forces from the territories of the Baltic\r\nStates\". In adopting resolution 47/21 by consensus, the\r\nGeneral Assembly called upon the Baltic States and the\r\nRussian Federation\r\n\"to conclude without delay appropriate agreements,\r\nincluding timetables, for the early, orderly and complete\r\nwithdrawal of foreign military forces from the\r\nterritories of Estonia and Latvia\". (resolution 47/21,\r\npara. 2)\r\nThe Russian Federation, in joining in the consensus for the\r\nadoption of resolution 47/21, affirmed its obligation to\r\nwithdraw its military forces from the Baltic States, which it\r\nhad earlier assumed as a participating State of the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe at the\r\nHelsinki meeting in July 1992.\r\nA fact-finding mission headed by Tommy Koh,\r\nAmbassador-at-Large of Singapore, recently returned from\r\nLatvia and the Baltic States to report to the\r\nSecretary-General on the implementation of resolution 47/21.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his efforts at ensuring\r\nthe implementation of this resolution. We also wish to thank\r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-seventh session, for accepting our invitation to visit\r\nLatvia in July 1993 and witnessing the situation in Latvia at\r\nfirst hand. I hope that, in addition to reviewing the situation\r\nregarding foreign military forces, Mr. Ganev gained insight\r\ninto Latvia’s process of renewal.\r\nBefore I report to the Assembly on the present situation\r\nregarding the issue of the foreign military forces on the\r\nterritory of Latvia, I should like to express Latvia’s support\r\nfor the ongoing democratic processes in the Russian\r\nFederation, at whose head is the lawfully elected President\r\nof the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin. I hope that the\r\npolitical and economic reform process in the Russian\r\nFederation will continue and that political forces there will\r\nsolve their problems using peaceful and democratic means.\r\nAt critical moments in the past, democratic forces in the\r\nRussian Federation have demonstrated their ability to act\r\ndecisively to keep the Russian Federation on the road to\r\ndemocracy. I am convinced that this will also be the case in\r\nthese, for Russia, difficult and complicated times.\r\nSince February 1992, State delegations of Latvia and\r\nthe Russian Federation have held eight sessions of\r\nnegotiations on the subject of troop withdrawal from Latvia.\r\nThese negotiations resulted in various agreements, which\r\ngovern technical matters during withdrawal. Unfortunately,\r\nwe have failed to secure agreement on the important\r\nquestion of a withdrawal timetable. Latvia has consistently\r\ndemanded that withdrawal be completed by the end of 1993,\r\ntwo and a half years after Latvia regained its independence.\r\nThe delegation of the Russian Federation has offered final\r\nwithdrawal dates ranging from 1994 until 1999, without ever\r\nsubmitting a concrete timetable or systematic plan for\r\nwithdrawal. The problem of the final withdrawal date is\r\ncompounded by the demands of the Russian Federation to\r\nmaintain three bases in Latvia: the radar station in Skrunda,\r\nthe cosmic intelligence centre in Ventspils and the naval\r\nbase in Liepaja. We have repeatedly stated, and the\r\ninternational community, including the Russian Federation,\r\nhas concurred, that withdrawal should be early and complete;\r\nfurthermore, we cannot permit our soil to be used for\r\npurposes that may be directed against third countries.\r\nA second principal issue on which the Russian\r\nFederation has held up its withdrawal from Latvia is its\r\ndemand for extraordinary social benefits for pensioned\r\nofficers of the former Soviet Union and the Russian\r\nFederation who are residing in Latvia. For years, the officer\r\ncorps of the occupying army was granted favourable access\r\nto apartments, medical care and other social services.\r\nDemands for continuation of such privileges are not only\r\nunacceptable to Latvia, but unjust to all its residents; we\r\nshall not permit these demands to delay the withdrawal\r\nprocess.\r\nAt the beginning of the negotiations between our two\r\nStates, in February 1992, agreement was reached on certain\r\nmatters. Among these was the requirement that both parties\r\nrefrain from uncoordinated, unilateral actions during the\r\nperiod of withdrawal. The time since then has been marked\r\nby such incidents as the military forces of the Russian\r\nFederation conducting unauthorized troop movements on the\r\nground, unauthorized naval movements through Latvia’s\r\nports and unauthorized air sorties in Latvian skies. Contrary\r\nto agreement, fresh recruits have secretly entered Latvia to\r\nreplace departing troops.\r\nIn the light of the continued presence of these forces,\r\nforeign investment in Latvia, which is necessary for the\r\ndevelopment of our small country, has been discouraged. In\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\naddition, the military forces of the Russian Federation have\r\ndone substantial damage to Latvia’s environment.\r\nLatvia seeks an assurance that its sovereignty,\r\nindependence and territorial integrity will be respected and\r\nthat a threat to international peace and security will not arise\r\nfrom its territory. I hope that the negotiations with the\r\nRussian Federation, which began yesterday, on 28 September\r\n1993, will be pragmatic in nature and will soon lead to an\r\nagreement providing for the complete withdrawal of foreign\r\nmilitary forces from the territory of Latvia. Such an\r\nagreement would have the potential to open a new chapter\r\nin the relationship between our two States, a chapter\r\ncontaining neither suspicion nor animosity. We could then\r\neven foresee a time when our societies and children would\r\nbe free of the prejudices of the past.\r\nLatvia welcomes the complete withdrawal of the\r\nmilitary forces of the Russian Federation from Lithuania,\r\nwhich is a step toward improving the security of the Baltic\r\nregion.\r\nAs I have stated, it is important to recognize that Latvia\r\nwas illegally occupied and annexed, and that a principal\r\nconsequence of these events is the significantly altered\r\ndemographic situation there. This situation must be taken\r\ninto account if one is to understand the internal situation in\r\nLatvia. In 1940, 75 per cent of Latvia’s inhabitants were\r\nethnic Latvians but today they constitute only 52 per cent of\r\nLatvia’s population. During the Soviet occupation, hundreds\r\nof thousands of persons were deported to Siberia, and many\r\nthousands were arrested and executed. During the Second\r\nWorld War tens of thousands died, were sent to Nazi\r\nGermany for forced labour, or were forced to emigrate to the\r\nWest in order to escape the Red Terror. In sum, during the\r\noccupation, the pre-war population of Latvia was reduced by\r\none third. Among the victims who suffered this fate were\r\nthe Livs, one of the indigenous peoples of Latvia, who at\r\npresent number only a few dozen.\r\nDuring the post-war years, the deportation and massive\r\ninvoluntary emigration of Latvians from their native land\r\nwas paralleled by a heavy influx of residents of the Soviet\r\nUnion. In 1945, newly arrived Soviet military personnel\r\nwere immediately allocated approximately 25 per cent of all\r\nthe apartments in Riga, the capital of Latvia. Many of these\r\napartments had earlier been vacated by Latvian families\r\nwhich had been deported to Siberia or which had been\r\nforced to flee to the West. In addition to the introduction\r\ninto Latvia of active and retired military personnel, the\r\nSoviet regime, using offers of various privileges, enticed\r\ncivilian labourers and managers from the Soviet Union to\r\nmigrate to Latvia.\r\nThe pace of population transfer increased dramatically\r\nafter 1959, when Soviet leaders initiated a policy of\r\ncolonization for Latvia by undertaking a heavy\r\nindustrialization drive there. During the next 30 years the\r\ntotal population of Latvia increased by 27 per cent. While\r\nthe indigenous population grew at a rate of 7.6 per cent,\r\npopulation growth in the migrant community was 58.5 per\r\ncent, with the result that mechanical growth exceeded natural\r\ngrowth by close to a factor of eight. I should like to stress\r\nthat no other country has lost, as a result of occupation and\r\ncolonialism, such a large part of its indigenous population\r\nduring modern times. In no other modern-day country has\r\nthe indigenous population nearly become a minority in its\r\nown country, as has happened in Latvia.\r\nWe believe that the restoration of our independence has\r\ngiven us the opportunity to improve our demographic\r\nsituation. If we can reach a point where Latvians feel secure\r\nabout their future, we will then have the freedom to invest\r\nmore of our resources in finding solutions to global\r\nproblems.\r\nThe change in the demographic situation of Latvia\r\nduring the Soviet occupation cannot be conveyed by\r\nnumbers alone. Latvians were subjected to discrimination,\r\nin particular with respect to the use of the Latvian language\r\nand professional development. Command of the Russian\r\nlanguage became necessary in both the educational system\r\nand many workplaces, while use of the Latvian language\r\nwas eliminated in many spheres. Further, the policy of the\r\nSoviet authorities was to prevent access by Latvians to\r\nprofessions in various governmental and strategic fields.\r\nWith a view to ensuring the survival of the Latvian\r\npeople, it has become necessary for Latvia to develop a law\r\non citizenship which will safeguard the national identity of\r\nits indigenous population. Concurrently, Latvia will uphold\r\nits obligations under international human rights law.\r\nLatvia has already determined its present body of\r\ncitizens through a process of resident registration. In 1991,\r\nalong with the restoration of its sovereignty and\r\nindependence, Latvia restored citizenship to those persons\r\nfrom whom it had been taken in 1940; this was done\r\nregardless of their national, religious or ethnic backgrounds,\r\nand citizenship was granted to their descendants as well.\r\nPursuant to Latvia’s Constitution, it is this body of persons\r\nwhich participated in the June 1993 parliamentary elections.\r\nLatvia’s present body of citizens includes approximately\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 9\r\n400,000 non-ethnic Latvians, or approximately 25 per cent\r\nof the electorate - a figure that reflects the non-ethnic\r\nLatvian composition of the electorate prior to the occupation\r\nin 1940.\r\nLatvia’s democratically elected Parliament, the Saeima,\r\nwill in the near future adopt a citizenship law which will set\r\nthe requirements, in accordance with international law, for\r\nobtaining Latvian citizenship for residents of Latvia who\r\narrived after 1940. Persons transferred into Latvia during the\r\nSoviet occupation exercise freely all rights granted by\r\ninternational human rights instruments. According to experts\r\nof the Council of Europe, the protection afforded by Latvia’s\r\nlegislation is comparable to that provided by the\r\nconstitutional instruments of most States members of the\r\nCouncil of Europe and guaranteed collectively by the\r\nCouncil of Europe, in particular through the European\r\nConvention on Human Rights.\r\nHistorical minorities of Latvia such as Russians,\r\nBelarussians, Poles, Jews and others have their own schools\r\nand active national cultural societies, which help to maintain\r\neach group’s national identity.\r\nA peaceful, legal and pragmatic restoration process has\r\nbegun in Latvia. Numerous appraisals by the international\r\ncommunity have affirmed that this process is in fact peaceful\r\nand is being conducted within the confines of international\r\nlaw.\r\nLatvia has no reason to hide its internal situation and\r\nhas thus welcomed numerous examinations of its human\r\nrights record. On behalf of Latvia, I should like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General and the States Members of the United\r\nNations for the fact-finding mission, headed by the present\r\nAssistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr. Ibrahima\r\nFall, which visited Latvia in October 1992. I should like to\r\nquote from the Mission’s conclusions:\r\n\"Latvia is going through a transitional period\r\nfollowing the reestablishment of independence. During\r\nthis period the Latvian Government is endeavouring to\r\nredress certain historical inequities and injustices\r\nperpetrated during Soviet rule from 1940 to 1991.\r\n\"This has given rise to anxiety among the\r\nnon-ethnic Latvians about their future status and role in\r\nthe country. It is this sense of insecurity rather than\r\nany gross violation of human rights that is most\r\ncharacteristic of the situation prevailing in Latvia today.\r\n\"The information received and examined by the\r\nMission does not reveal gross and systematic violations\r\nof human rights in Latvia. Individual violations which\r\nhave been reported are limited and not related to\r\ndiscriminatory policy as such and they should and can\r\nbe remedied at the appropriate level. On the positive\r\nside, it should be emphasized that no instances of\r\nviolence, no mass dismissals from employment,\r\nexclusion from educational establishments, evictions\r\nfrom apartments, or expulsions were reported.\"\r\n(A/47/748, paras. 21-23)\r\nThe report of the United Nations human rights\r\nfact-finding mission to Latvia is similar to reports submitted\r\nby the Council of Europe, the Conference on Security and\r\nCo-operation in Europe and the European Court of Human\r\nRights. Despite these numerous affirmations that human\r\nrights are not being violated in Latvia, it has become the\r\nobject of political attacks - the Russian Federation constantly\r\naccuses Latvia of human rights violations. Latvia has\r\nexpended great efforts and resources to refute these\r\nunsubstantiated allegations. In addition, resources of\r\ninternational organizations, including the United Nations,\r\nhave been expended.\r\nI shall now address the grave financial crisis that faces\r\nthe United Nations and has forced the Secretary-General to\r\ntake drastic measures to economize. Latvia believes that a\r\nsolution to the crisis that is acceptable to all Member States\r\nand based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations must be found.\r\nLatvia wishes to bring to the attention of the General\r\nAssembly an ad hoc decision which was made for reasons\r\nof financial and political expediency, but which will in fact\r\ncontribute to the financial crisis. I am referring to the\r\ndecision taken by the General Assembly in December 1992\r\nto determine, inter alia, the assessment rates of 15 Member\r\nStates, including Latvia, according to an ad hoc method\r\nrather than the standard method for determining capacity to\r\npay.\r\nThe December 1992 decision is not in accordance with\r\nthe Charter principle of sovereign equality because the two\r\ndifferent methods for determining assessments result in\r\nunequal financial obligations for different Member States.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that Latvia and the other two Baltic\r\nStates are not successors to the former Soviet Union, they\r\nhave been made to assume excessive financial obligations of\r\nthe former Soviet Union and even to accept a portion of its\r\ncontribution to the Working Capital Fund.\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nLatvia is now entering its third year as a State Member\r\nof the United Nations. We expect to increase our\r\ninvolvement in the work of the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations, participating in the search for\r\nsolutions to global problems. At the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights in Vienna, we addressed two problem areas\r\nwhere we should be able to make contributions: the rights\r\nof minorities and the rights of foreigners.\r\nLatvia reiterates the offer it made at the Earth Summit\r\nin Rio de Janeiro to host an international conference in its\r\nresort city of Jurmala to examine possibilities for redirecting\r\nresources from armaments towards rehabilitating the\r\nenvironment.\r\nLatvia supports the establishment of the post of United\r\nNations high commissioner for human rights. We also urge\r\nan increase in the percentage of the regular budget allocated\r\nto the Centre for Human Rights in Geneva.\r\nThe position of Latvia regarding non-governmental\r\norganizations is that they play a valuable role on the\r\ninternational stage, especially in the area of human rights.\r\nTheir access to the United Nations human-rights system\r\nshould be increased.\r\nWith respect to the debate on restructuring the Security\r\nCouncil, Latvia supports increasing the number of members\r\nof the Security Council. Such reform must ensure that the\r\nCouncil is adequately balanced between large and small\r\nStates.\r\nLatvia supports the efforts aimed at rationalizing the\r\nstructure and the agenda of the General Assembly.\r\nLatvia welcomes the positive processes under way in\r\nthe Middle East, South Africa, Cambodia and Haiti. We\r\nhope that, with the efforts of the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations, peace will prevail in the former\r\nYugoslavia, Georgia, Somalia and elsewhere where blood is\r\nstill being spilt.\r\nLatvia has a history of participation in international\r\naffairs, including its term as Presiding Member of the\r\nCouncil of the League of Nations. In order to mark our\r\nhistoric contribution to international relations, and to\r\ncelebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the signing of our\r\ndeclaration of independence, Latvia has undertaken the task\r\nof restoring a hall at the United Nations Office in Geneva.\r\nThis hall, located in the Palais des Nations, and adorned\r\nwith amber collected from the shores of the Baltic Sea, was\r\ndecorated and endowed by the Government and the people\r\nof Latvia in 1938 as a donation to the League of Nations.\r\nMay the return of that hall at the Palais des Nations to its\r\noriginal splendour symbolize the victory of justice\r\nconstituted by the return of Latvia to full membership in the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIt is my belief that the restoration of our independence\r\nwill enable Latvia, a small State, to play a greater role in\r\nsecuring peace and democracy in the world. I am convinced\r\nthat together we can leave our children a better world with\r\nmore security, more faith and more freedom.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nLatvia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Guntis Ulmanis, President of the Republic of\r\nLatvia, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nADDRESS BY MRS. VIOLETA BARRIOS DE\r\nCHAMORRO, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF\r\nNICARAGUA\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua.\r\nMrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic\r\nof Nicaragua, Her Excellency Mrs. Violeta Barrios de\r\nChamorro, and to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident BARRIOS de CHAMORRO (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): Allow me to congratulate you sincerely, Sir,\r\non behalf of our Latin American and Caribbean region, on\r\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits forty-eighth session.\r\nSome nations, like Nicaragua, are in transition from war\r\nto peace. We are in the process of shaking off an\r\ninheritance of 50 years of right-wing dictatorship and\r\n10 years of left-wing dictatorship. At the same time, we are\r\nmoving from a centralized economy to a social market\r\neconomy. Each one of these three transitions is an\r\nenormous challenge requiring fluid and timely international\r\npolitical and economic cooperation.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 11\r\nNicaragua is a special case. My country has had to\r\nendure this triple transition. We are overcoming a post-war\r\nera, building democracy and restoring our economy’s\r\nstrength and dynamism, all in the midst of a polarized\r\nsociety. I sincerely believe that few societies in\r\ncontemporary history have had to confront so many\r\nchallenges at the same time and in such difficult\r\ncircumstances.\r\nThe Governments and organizations that have been\r\nfollowing closely the critical situation in which I found my\r\ncountry when I took office - with a gross national product\r\nsimilar to that of an economy of the 1940s and an\r\nunprecedented rate of hyperinflation - can easily understand\r\nthe magnitude of our efforts.\r\nWe need to build a democracy, reconstruct a wounded\r\nsociety and compete economically with the world, all while\r\nfollowing an economic adjustment plan that leaves us no\r\nresources for social investment. There is hunger in my\r\ncountry. There is hatred. There are many weapons. But\r\nthere is also an absolute desire to build a society at peace.\r\nNicaragua has been a symbol of war and of hope in this\r\ndecade. Nicaragua should continue to be a symbol of hope.\r\nWe will achieve this only with international assistance.\r\nWith great effort, we have limited inflation to\r\n3.5 per cent annually, but with such difficulty that we were\r\nable to achieve economic growth of only 0.2 per cent in\r\n1992, after eight years of a falling gross national product.\r\nI recognize that the international community has tried\r\nto understand the immense complexity of our process. In\r\n1990, the General Assembly granted Nicaragua special\r\ntreatment, and called upon the international community to\r\nprovide us with effective and timely support. Since then,\r\nmy country has fulfilled all agreements and commitments\r\nundertaken with multilateral institutions and the international\r\ncommunity. We are engaged in creating the necessary\r\nconditions so that private, national and international\r\ninvestment can contribute to the economic growth of the\r\ncountry and hence initiate the reconstruction process and the\r\nsustained development needed by Nicaragua.\r\nAfter paying for oil imports and external debt, my\r\nGovernment has received international assistance amounting\r\nto an average of less than $12 million a year, which does not\r\ncover the costs of such a difficult and complex transition.\r\nOur economy has stabilized; however, this has been a slow\r\nprocess and it does not satisfy the aspirations of an\r\nimpoverished people demanding the attainment, in a short\r\nperiod of time, of levels of well-being that they deserve.\r\nThe economic problem is our greatest source of\r\ninstability, because it creates tensions in the political and\r\nsocial environment, jeopardizing national and regional\r\nstability. If foreign aid arrives late, if strong conditions are\r\nplaced on it or it becomes a political tool, as happened in\r\n1992 and is happening now, democracy in Nicaragua could\r\ncollapse.\r\nMy country depends on the financial support of the\r\ninternational community. Our exports are equivalent to only\r\n$250 million a year, and we need $850 million to finance\r\nour imports and service our inherited external debt.\r\nI have come to the General Assembly, to this forum of\r\nfraternal nations, to ask the international community to\r\ncontinue helping Nicaragua. We need the United Nations to\r\nhelp us to maintain and to guarantee economic bilateral\r\ncooperation at current levels for my country. We need\r\nadditional resources to reactivate economic production and\r\ngrowth, to strengthen the creation of social networks and to\r\nrenew the process of conciliation.\r\nWe must not forget that on 25 February 1990, to the\r\nsurprise of the entire international community, we held the\r\nfirst free and participatory elections in all the history of my\r\ncountry. On that day, Nicaraguans laid down their weapons\r\nand we all celebrated the triumph of peace, aware that we\r\nwere choosing the path of democracy, freedom, peace and\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nWhen the time came to vote, every citizen voted against\r\ndecades of violence and bloodshed, and as we voted, we\r\nthought about erasing from our minds the sad images of\r\n10 years of war, the orphans, the widows and the maimed.\r\nWe voted in the determination to put an end to the tragic\r\nparade of soldiers, many of them children, combatants in a\r\nwar between brothers.\r\nThis was my first mandate: to generate a policy of\r\nnational reconciliation; not an easy task in a society\r\naccustomed to political polarization and to confrontation.\r\nToday, three years later, I continue to be committed to\r\npursuing national dialogue as the only viable way to solve\r\nour problems. The call to achieve this national\r\nunderstanding has been met with solidarity and support from\r\ncountries and international organizations.\r\nIn the national dialogue, we rely on the presence, which\r\ngreatly enhances the validity of the process, of\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nrepresentatives of the Presidents of Central America, a\r\nregion that can envision its future only in the larger prospect\r\nof integration and unity with Nicaragua.\r\nThe sincere gratitude of my people and Government\r\ngoes to my Central American colleagues, to the\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General of the Organization\r\nof American States, to the Catholic Church and to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, who have\r\ncontributed so much to peace and reconciliation in\r\nNicaragua.\r\nI especially wish to thank the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations for his support in the formation of an active\r\ngroup of donor countries, friends of Nicaragua, which,\r\nwithin the context of the United Nations, will help us\r\nidentify our requirements for external cooperation and the\r\nmeans for channelling this necessary assistance.\r\nI believe that countries in transition from war to peace,\r\nwhich have signed international agreements to attain total\r\npacification, democracy and reconstruction, should have\r\naccess to a special fund to enable them to stand again on\r\ntheir own feet and go forward.\r\nNicaragua and other countries in Latin America, such\r\nas Haiti and El Salvador, need exceptional treatment because\r\nwe cannot compete with nations that have not suffered the\r\npain of the political, economic and social destruction caused\r\nby war.\r\nWhen we appeal to the international community, we do\r\nso in the conviction that the principal efforts for the\r\nreconstruction of our country are our own responsibility as\r\nNicaraguans, as the actors in our own development. The\r\nGovernment of which I am President assumes this level of\r\nresponsibility in order to prevent our democracy from\r\nregressing. I reaffirm once more before the Assembly the\r\ncommitment I made to the Nicaraguan nation not to rest\r\nuntil democracy has been consolidated.\r\nI shall continue to work to ensure that freedom of\r\nexpression, assembly and association are never again\r\nrestricted. My commitment to human rights is firm and\r\nunalterable.\r\nMy decision to achieve the institutionalization of the\r\narmed forces in Nicaragua is irreversible. For that reason,\r\nin addition to drastically reducing my country’s army, I am\r\nintroducing reforms and laws that will guarantee the total\r\nsubordination of the military to civilian authority and clearly\r\nestablish fixed terms of office in the upper echelons.\r\nWe are in the process of building a democratic\r\ninstitutional structure, including a small, professional,\r\nnon-partisan army at the service of the nation as a whole.\r\nSimilarly, we are making great efforts to disarm civilian\r\ngroups and to prevent the thousands of weapons already\r\nconfiscated from being used once again to undermine\r\nNicaragua’s democratic achievements and so undermine the\r\nregional stability of Central America. Weapons confiscated\r\nby our authorities are burned in public for all to see.\r\nIn consultation with other countries of the international\r\ncommunity, my Government has decided to host in our\r\ncapital city of Managua, in May 1994, the second\r\ninternational conference on new and restored democracies.\r\nWe want to share experiences, closely examine the structures\r\nof the new democracies and adopt proposals that will\r\ncontribute to their self-betterment.\r\nThe United Nations must respond positively to the\r\nchanges in the world today. Nicaragua supports recognition\r\nby the United Nations of the rights of the Republic of China -\r\nTaiwan. We believe it is only right to recognize the\r\nfundamental rights of the 21 million people who live on that\r\nterritory. Nicaragua firmly supports this noble initiative.\r\nFinally, I share the joy of all our countries at the\r\nhistoric signing of the declaration of principles between the\r\nGovernment of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization. This agreement clearly demonstrates that\r\npeace is possible when the will for dialogue and negotiation\r\nexists. It should serve as one of the great lessons of our\r\ntimes and a source of new hope for global peace.\r\nWe Nicaraguans trust in God, in the solidarity of\r\nfriendly nations and in cooperation by international\r\norganizations; the generous, fraternal, sincere hand they\r\nstretch out to us will enable the Nicaraguan people to\r\nachieve the new society of which it dreamt when it voted in\r\nour general elections on 25 February 1990.\r\nWe in Nicaragua know that the century that is coming\r\nto an end leaves us some hard lessons. Yet it allows us to\r\nface with courage the great challenges that will enable us to\r\nconsolidate a world society inspired by peace, freedom and\r\nprogress. For that reason, on the threshold of the new\r\ncentury, I would like to reaffirm, in the name of the\r\nNicaraguan people, our deep commitment to contribute to\r\nthe development of a more prosperous and more just world\r\norder. That is the commitment I make to democracy and to\r\nall the peoples of the world.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 13\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Nicaragua for the statement she\r\nhas just made.\r\nMrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nMr. KINKEL (Germany) (spoke in German; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): Please accept my warm\r\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. I wish you\r\nluck and success in your high office. At the same time, I\r\nextend a cordial welcome to the new Members of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nAddressing the Assembly 20 years ago, Willy Brandt\r\nsaid that the Federal Republic of Germany’s purpose in\r\njoining the United Nations was to help serve the cause of\r\nworld peace. That has always been, and will remain, the\r\nfundamental aim of German foreign policy. At that time, in\r\na bipolar world, Germany was divided. In that year, 1973,\r\nthe October war broke out in the Middle East. In South\r\nAfrica the inhuman apartheid regime was dominant. Today\r\nmy country is united in peace and harmony with our\r\nneighbours. Today we can congratulate Israel, the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and neighbouring Arab\r\ncountries on a historic breakthrough. Today the policy of\r\napartheid has been overcome. Without the resolve to seek\r\npeace, these developments would not have been possible.\r\nWorld peace, which appears to have come closer as\r\nbipolarity has receded, must not remain an unfulfilled vision.\r\nThe international community’s desire for peace led to the\r\nfounding of the United Nations after the Second World War.\r\nIt remains our moral and political obligation to fulfil that\r\nlegacy. There can be no more important task. In the quest\r\nfor peace we are faced with a new challenge and a new\r\ndanger, but we also have a historic opportunity.\r\nWe are faced with the great challenge of overcoming\r\nhunger and poverty around the world, of preserving the\r\nnatural sources of life, and of creating the foundations for a\r\nlong-term global population policy. When people have to\r\nleave their native lands, when human rights are violated,\r\nthere can be no peace. Peace is not merely the silence of\r\nguns. Hence, economic and social challenges must be very\r\nhigh on the global agenda. The world is deeply unjust. The\r\ndistribution of mankind’s opportunities is woefully unequal.\r\nThis we should not tolerate.\r\nThe danger confronting us is that peace in many parts\r\nof the world is threatened by new conflicts, especially those\r\nof an ethnic nature. The continuing proliferation of modern\r\nweapons and weapon technology increases the destructive\r\npotential of these conflicts.\r\nOur opportunity, after the end of the East-West\r\nconfrontation, is to develop the United Nations into what its\r\nfounding fathers intended it to be: the principal guardian of\r\npeace. In performing that role the United Nations must have\r\nthe support of the numerous other international organizations\r\nthat are functioning successfully today.\r\nI truly believe that we can master the economic,\r\necological and social challenges and overcome the danger of\r\na relapse into a confrontation of States, peoples, cultures and\r\nreligions only if we resolutely seize the historic opportunity\r\nto strengthen the global multilateral system and the United\r\nNations.\r\nToday no country alone can cope with global\r\nchallenges. Hence we must counteract nationalism with\r\nmultilateralism. German foreign policy is aimed at\r\nstrengthening the multilateral world order. It is committed\r\nto the goal of European integration. Its purpose is to\r\nharmonize and create a fair balance of interests. German\r\nforeign policy is therefore a policy within, in support of, and\r\ntogether with the United Nations.\r\nI agree with the Secretary-General: Peace can only be\r\npreserved if we strike at the roots of conflict. His proposed\r\nagenda for development must go hand-in-hand with \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\". Misery, starvation and poverty are still\r\nthe overriding problem in many countries.\r\nAt the eighth session of the United Nations Conference\r\non Trade and Development and at the Rio Conference, the\r\ndeveloping and industrial countries agreed on a\r\ncomprehensive partnership for promoting development and\r\nprotecting the environment. For that partnership to be\r\nsuccessful both sides, North and South, must contribute their\r\nshare. By carrying out economic and political reforms,\r\nmaking more efficient use of their funds and cutting military\r\nexpenditure, and ensuring greater democratic control and\r\nrespect for the rule of law, many developing countries have\r\nembarked on the right course. The World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, scheduled to take place in Copenhagen in\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\n1995, must be a forum for dialogue on the social issues\r\nre-emerging all over the world.\r\nThe industrial countries have undertaken to support the\r\nefforts of the developing countries by improving the general\r\nconditions for world trade in a spirit of solidarity. Such\r\nassistance can never be more than help towards self-help.\r\nWhat is required is more entrepreneurial cooperation with\r\ndeveloping countries, more direct investment, improved\r\ncooperation in the field of technology, the opening of\r\nmarkets and the elimination of trade barriers. The Uruguay\r\nRound of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\r\n(GATT) must at long last establish reliable rules for free\r\ntrade and be brought to a conclusion by December 15.\r\nGermany, one of the leading trading nations, is committed\r\nto these goals. If new trading blocs were to form, with the\r\nattendant conflicting interests, new political confrontations\r\nwould soon follow. Protectionism would be the worst\r\noutcome.\r\nThe global economy is in the throes of a fundamental\r\nstructural change. International competition is becoming\r\nmore intense. Many highly industrialized societies are\r\nconfronted with fresh challenges. Unemployment and\r\nsluggish growth are unexpectedly severe burdens on their\r\nproductive capacity, both domestically and externally. On\r\nthe other hand, the trend towards a single world economy\r\nopens up the first opportunity for billions of people to offer\r\ntheir products in all markets.\r\nAll of us, industrial and developing countries alike,\r\nmust make peace with nature. The United Nations is called\r\nupon to protect the natural foundations of life. I propose\r\nthat the United Nations develop an early-warning system for\r\nenvironmental disasters. The momentum of the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development must\r\nbe maintained. My country is ready for comprehensive\r\ncooperation. Germany can make a special contribution,\r\nparticularly as regards the transfer of environment-friendly\r\ntechnologies.\r\nThe population explosion is a threat to the planet’s\r\nequilibrium. Whereas in the eighteenth century the world\r\npopulation increased by a quarter of a billion in 75 years, it\r\nis now increasing by this number every three years. Most\r\nof this increase is taking place in countries whose economic\r\nand ecological resources are already strained to the limit.\r\nFamily planning must be enhanced, the poverty gap reduced,\r\nand education and knowledge disseminated among women\r\nand men alike. A successful International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, to be held in Cairo next year,\r\nis therefore mandatory.\r\nRespect for human rights is a universal obligation. It\r\nis a focal point of German foreign policy. Human rights and\r\nthe protection of minorities belong together. Racism,\r\ncultural arrogance and the delusion of wanting to create\r\n\"ethnically clean\" areas constitute a threat to peace.\r\nYugoslavia is a terrible example of this. Where civic,\r\neconomic, cultural and religious rights of minorities are\r\nconcerned, the majority may not rule by fiat.\r\nThe Declaration and Programme of Action of the\r\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights represent the\r\nconsensus opinion of the community of nations. They\r\nreaffirm the universal validity of the human rights. Now it\r\nis important to seek rapid implementation. I wish to\r\nmention five specific points:\r\nFirstly, my country has long advocated the appointment\r\nof a high commissioner for human rights. He should be\r\nauthorized to take steps on his own initiative to protect\r\nhuman rights and to give active support to those countries\r\nseeking to improve the human rights situation.\r\nSecondly, we need an international criminal court. The\r\nInternational Law Commission has submitted a full draft\r\nstatute for such a court. The pressure on those who trample\r\nhuman rights under foot must be increased now. Those who\r\ntorture on this Earth must live in fear of punishment.\r\nThirdly, in order to prosecute speedily those who are\r\nresponsible for the ghastly violations of human rights in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, the Security Council has set up an ad\r\nhoc Tribunal. The elected judges must now begin their work\r\nright away. A chief prosecutor should be appointed without\r\ndelay.\r\nFourthly, the non-governmental organizations have\r\nbecome part of the world’s conscience and therefore have an\r\nincreasingly important role to play in the defence of human\r\nrights.\r\nFinally, the instruments for ensuring respect for human\r\nrights must be given a higher priority in the United Nations\r\nbudget.\r\nThe crisis in the former Yugoslavia, and especially the\r\nwar in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is one of the most\r\ndepressing episodes of our time. A Member of the United\r\nNations has fallen victim to a war of conquest accompanied\r\nby genocide and mass expulsions. For the first time since\r\nthe Second World War, frontiers in Europe are being\r\nredrawn by force of arms. The principles of the United\r\nNations have been treated with contempt. The credibility of\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 15\r\nour institutions - indeed the credibility of the United Nations\r\nitself - is being put to the test.\r\nIf the fighting continues, the winter will prove to be an\r\nawful disaster for the suffering people. It must therefore be\r\nstopped as quickly as possible and steps taken to ensure that\r\nhumanitarian aid is provided. We therefore support the\r\nGeneva efforts to settle the conflict, in spite of doubts about\r\nthe current plan, and we express special thanks to the\r\nCo-Chairmen, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, for the\r\ndifficult job they are doing.\r\nA settlement now seems within reach, but it must be\r\naccepted by all parties to the conflict. No party must impose\r\nits will on another. The Bosnian Muslims must be given\r\nviable territory. We need an assurance that the community\r\nof nations will be resolutely and actively involved in the\r\nimplementation of a settlement.\r\nWe cannot tolerate a situation in which the Muslims,\r\nwho have lived in Europe for centuries, would have fewer\r\nrights than their Christian neighbours. Through preventive\r\nmeasures we must ensure that the tragedy of this war does\r\nnot spill over into neighbouring regions. What is now\r\nrequired is proposals for controlled disarmament in the\r\nregion. This is a task for the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE).\r\nAfter decades of war and bitter antagonism, the Middle\r\nEast is experiencing a historic breakthrough towards peace.\r\nWe all want the peace process to become irreversible.\r\nGermany and its partners in the European Community have\r\nundertaken to provide political, economic and particularly\r\nfinancial support. They have earmarked about a billion\r\ndeutschemarks for this purpose.\r\nI should like to express my respect for both sides for\r\ntheir political courage and their will for peace. I call upon\r\nthose who still hesitate to help sustain the peace process. I\r\nappeal to all to renounce the use of force.\r\nThe continuing proliferation of arms in many parts of\r\nthe world is still highly disturbing. President Clinton’s\r\nproposals have our support. Encouraging progress has been\r\nachieved in the form of the Convention placing a global ban\r\non chemical weapons and of the agreement reached on a\r\nmandate for negotiations in the Geneva Conference on\r\nDisarmament with a view to a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\r\nThe test moratorium must be extended. There must be no\r\nfurther testing.\r\nThe nuclear and non-nuclear Powers alike are urged to\r\nconsolidate the non-proliferation regime. When the matter\r\ncomes up for decision in 1995, the Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\nmust be extended indefinitely. As the representative of a\r\ncountry which many years ago unilaterally and bindingly\r\nrenounced the possession of nuclear weapons and other\r\nmeans of mass destruction, I appeal to all Members: accede\r\nto the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\r\nThe laying of mines in large regions in many countries\r\nhas become a scourge for the population. It prevents the\r\nreturn of refugees and the resumption of farming.\r\nThousands have been killed or horribly mutilated. It must\r\nbe stopped. The European Community has, with our\r\nsupport, seized the initiative. We need a fund to finance\r\nmine detection and disposal operations.\r\nMy country’s European anchorage is indispensable on\r\nboth political and economic grounds. My Belgian colleague,\r\nWilly Claes, has already explained the position of the 12\r\nmembers of the European Community.\r\nStability in Europe cannot remain a privilege of the\r\nWestern nations. The peoples of the reformist countries\r\nfought for their freedom and we encouraged them to do so.\r\nWe shall not abandon them now. We must gradually open\r\nthe road to the Euro-Atlantic institutions for the countries of\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe. Those institutions include the\r\nEuropean Community and the Council of Europe as well as\r\nthe Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO). I am expecting a clear message from\r\nthe NATO summit - which is to take place at the beginning\r\nof 1994 - like the one that came from the European\r\nCommunity summit meeting in Copenhagen. In this process,\r\nno new ruptures must emerge. A lasting peaceful order in\r\nEurope is not feasible without including Russia.\r\nOver the last four years Germany has made a greater\r\nfinancial effort than any other nation to help the reformist\r\ncountries on their road to democracy, the rule of law and a\r\nfree market economy. This assistance, too, is a major\r\ncontribution to conflict-prevention and the safeguarding of\r\npeace. In the present critical phase, Russia’s friends and\r\npartners - who include the Germans in particular - must\r\ncontinue to provide political and economic support for\r\nPresident Yeltsin’s reforms.\r\nI am concerned about developments in Georgia. We\r\nmust achieve a cease-fire and work out a viable political\r\nsolution. This is a task for the United Nations in particular.\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe desire for peace makes it imperative for all\r\ncountries to seek closer regional cooperation.We support\r\nintra-Africa efforts to resolve conflicts and welcome the\r\nstronger commitment on the part of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity.\r\nWe are gratified by the democratic changes to be\r\nobserved in Latin America in recent years. Nearly\r\neverywhere democracy and free-market principles have\r\nasserted themselves and sources of conflict have, thank God,\r\nbeen eliminated.\r\nThe Association of South-East Asian Nations has\r\nbecome an important instrument for cooperation in the\r\nAsia-Pacific region. European-Asian cooperation must be\r\nintensified.\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" has become the lodestone for\r\nthe world Organization’s further development. I wish to\r\ntake this opportunity, Mr. Secretary-General, to express my\r\nthanks for your commitment. The Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly have constructively taken up the Agenda’s\r\nproposals. However, conflict prevention must begin at an\r\nearly stage. Preventing fires is better than having to put\r\nthem out. We must focus our energy on the possibilities of\r\npreventive diplomacy, confidence-building measures,\r\nfact-finding and the early detection of conflicts.\r\nThe CSCE must back the United Nations within its\r\nsphere of jurisdiction. The relations between the two\r\norganizations have been intensified. The CSCE should be\r\ngiven wider scope for conflict prevention and crisis\r\nmanagement.\r\nIn wars and crises, the Blue Helmets have helped to\r\nprotect the civilian population, to prevent the spread of\r\nwarfare and to initiate the transition to democracy. Some\r\n80,000 troops from more than 70 countries are engaged in\r\n17 peace-keeping missions around the world. They and the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat’s Department of Peace-keeping\r\nOperations deserve our thanks.\r\nOne of the most successful operations was the one in\r\nNamibia. In Cambodia the United Nations has sponsored\r\nfree elections and restored hopes of lasting peace after\r\ndecades of terror and oppression. Of course - and it is\r\nimportant to stress this - not all the hopes placed in the\r\nUnited Nations can be fulfilled, and it would be wrong to\r\ndeny that difficulties have been encountered. But what\r\nwould happen without the United Nations and the Blue\r\nHelmets? To the critics I therefore say that we need not less\r\nbut more commitment to the United Nations.\r\nIn Somalia starvation has been overcome. The\r\nreconciliation process has been overshadowed by incidents\r\nin which troops and civilians have been killed. These are\r\ntragedies, but without the United Nations Operation in\r\nSomalia, hundreds of thousands would have had to die.\r\nGermany has been providing humanitarian aid within the\r\nscope of this major peace-keeping operation, our largest\r\ncommitment of personnel so far within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nOur involvement in such operations has the backing of\r\nthe German people. There is a consensus in our country in\r\nfavour of widening our scope for contributing to peace. We\r\nare engaged in a passionate debate over proposed\r\nconstitutional amendments which would enable Germany to\r\nparticipate in all United Nations operations without\r\nrestriction.\r\nA policy for peace also means strengthening the rule of\r\nlaw as opposed to the rule of the strong. If the United\r\nNations is prevented from carrying out its mandate, it will\r\nhave to be in a position to authorize the Security Council to\r\nresort to force, as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nHowever, the use of military means should be\r\nconsidered only if we have a clear political blueprint for\r\nresolving the conflict. Force must always be the last resort.\r\nConsequently, our contribution to the United Nations will\r\ncontinue to be of a mainly political and economic nature.\r\nGreater emphasis will have to be placed on United Nations\r\npeace-keeping measures in view of the growing\r\nresponsibilities and demands.\r\nFirst, the United Nations Secretariat’s Department of\r\nPeace-keeping Operations must be improved logistically and\r\norganizationally and in terms of staff. The German\r\nGovernment is willing to make further experts available to\r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nSecondly, effective crisis management presupposes the\r\nability to react swiftly. The Secretary-General’s initiative for\r\nthe establishment of stand-by forces has my support.\r\nStand-by forces should not be confined to military units but\r\nshould include civilian personnel and experts ranging from\r\npolice to election observers. But participation must always\r\nbe voluntary and be subject to the fulfilment of national\r\nconditions.\r\nThirdly, enhancing the efficiency of the United Nations\r\npresupposes a link-up of military forces. The North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO) has declared its willingness to\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 17\r\nmake its capacities available. The same holds true for the\r\nWestern European Union (WEU).\r\nFourthly, in many countries military training is geared\r\nsolely to the traditional duties of the army. The specific\r\ntasks of peace-keeping require a completely different kind of\r\ntraining. The national preparation of \"Blue-Helmet\" forces\r\nneeds to be coordinated to a greater degree by the United\r\nNations. For this, common training guidelines are needed.\r\nThe United Nations should also create its own training\r\ncapacity; that is my view. Common training and exercises\r\nare, at the same time, important steps in confidence-building.\r\nFifthly, peace-keeping operations require sound\r\nfinancing. The responsibility for peace also includes the\r\nprompt and complete payment of contributions by all\r\nMembers.\r\nHumanitarian concerns have been of pivotal importance\r\nfor Germany’s involvement in United Nations activities from\r\nthe very start. In the Middle East, in Africa, in South-East\r\nAsia, in the Gulf region, in Somalia and in former\r\nYugoslavia we are providing humanitarian assistance. We\r\nhave assumed responsibility for transport, medical care, the\r\nmonitoring of disarmament measures and the repatriation of\r\nrefugees. Together with our partners in the European\r\nCommunity we have called for the creation of a post of\r\ncoordinator for humanitarian assistance.\r\nPart of our humanitarian commitment is the readiness\r\nto assist refugees from the civil war, whose situation is very\r\ndistressing. We have admitted more than 350,000 refugees\r\nfrom former Yugoslavia. I urge the General Assembly to\r\nuse every opportunity to strengthen the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Mrs.\r\nOgata deserves high praise for the job she is doing. More\r\ninternational solidarity and burden-sharing is called for. We\r\nmust not abandon those countries which, as neighbouring or\r\ntarget countries for the refugees, are particularly affected.\r\nThe aim must be to offer shelter to refugees from civil wars\r\nor other disasters near their home countries in order to\r\nfacilitate their early return to those countries. For this we\r\nneed binding rules. I therefore propose the drafting of an\r\ninternational convention to regulate large-scale refugee\r\nmovements.\r\nAnother focal point of our involvement in United\r\nNations activities has been what the Secretary-General refers\r\nto in his \"Agenda for Peace\" as post-conflict peace-building.\r\nLasting peace depends on the establishment of democratic\r\nand market-economy structures based on the rule of law.\r\nInvestment in the democratization process is an investment\r\nin peace. My country, Germany, sees this as a priority of its\r\ncommitment to development. That is why Germany\r\nparticipates in missions to observe elections, provides\r\neconomic experts, and assists in the creation of democratic\r\nadministrative, judicial and police institutions.\r\nI should like to stress that a culture of peace is another\r\nprerequisite for lasting peace. Not only governments but\r\nalso individual citizens must develop the will for peace if we\r\nwant to overcome racial hatred and religious conflict. A\r\nculture of peace encompasses a dialogue between ethnic\r\ngroups as well as between religions and cultures. The\r\nEuropeans live next door to and in close contact with Islam.\r\nWe need bridges of mutual understanding, not new enemy\r\nimages. We need to promote education for peace. The\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), with its mandate to foster relations\r\nbetween nations, therefore deserves comprehensive support.\r\nGermany advocates the strengthening of all United\r\nNations bodies. We do not want a never-ending discussion\r\non reform, but greater efficiency. We welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to reorganize the Secretariat.\r\nThe efforts to revitalize the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council also meet with our full\r\nsupport. We would be happy if the United Nations were\r\nbetter represented in Germany and have therefore made an\r\noffer for the relocation of institutions of technical\r\ncooperation to Bonn.\r\nThe most important decisions on security and peace are\r\ntoday made in the Security Council. This is what the\r\nCharter envisaged right from the start. Anyone who wants\r\npeace must strengthen the Security Council.\r\nIn its response to the Secretary-General’s request, the\r\nFederal Government has stated that efficiency and credibility\r\nare of equal importance for the future composition of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nGermany is prepared to assume responsibility as a\r\npermanent member of the Security Council also. I stated\r\nthis at the last session of the General Assembly. However,\r\nwe will be able to maintain and strengthen the credibility of\r\nthe Council only if, in deliberating on reforming it, we also\r\ntake into consideration the growing importance of the third\r\nworld.\r\nFinally, let me state that Germany wants to be and will\r\nbe a driving force in efforts to strengthen the United\r\nNations. We need to achieve a basic consensus for the\r\nimportant tasks ahead of us. In my view this consensus lies\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nin the rule of law. The law protects the weak and\r\nlegitimizes force where it is unavoidable. The law is an\r\nexpression of partnership and is opposed to tyranny and\r\nhegemony. It is the acceptance of law that creates justice.\r\nOnly where justice reigns can peace flourish.\r\nMr. QIAN Qichen (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): At the outset I should like warmly to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that given\r\nyour proven talent and extensive experience, and with the\r\ncooperation of all delegations, you will steer our session to\r\nfull success. I also wish to express my sincere thanks to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for his remarkable\r\naccomplishments during the last session. I would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to extend a warm welcome and\r\ncongratulations to the new Members which have been\r\nadmitted to the United Nations this year.\r\nThe world has moved into a transitional period towards\r\nmultipolarity since the disintegration of the bipolar structure.\r\nIt had been hoped that the end of the cold war would bring\r\npeace and prosperity to the world. Indeed, the prospects of\r\navoiding another world war and ensuring a lasting peace\r\nhave improved. However, contradictions that had lain\r\ndormant during the cold war have begun to emerge, and\r\nmanifestations of hegemonism and power politics in\r\ninternational relations are on the rise. Peace and devel-\r\nopment, so ardently aspired to by mankind, still face grave\r\nchallenges.\r\nThe relative stability Europe once enjoyed has been\r\nupset. Many countries are plagued by severe economic\r\nslumps or by political upheaval. Some regions are torn by\r\nethnic or religious feuds exacerbated by territorial disputes,\r\nleading to intermittent conflicts and armed clashes. A\r\nregional war is raging at the southern end of the Eurasian\r\nland mass. All this can only have a negative impact on\r\nEurope and on the world at large.\r\nIn the meantime, a number of developed countries have\r\ndeveloped a \"post-cold-war syndrome\". Some have sunk\r\ninto the longest recession since the Second World War. In\r\nthe new setting, internal contradictions have sharpened,\r\npolitical scandals are rife, racism has reared its ugly head,\r\ntrade protectionism is on the rise, and xenophobic violence\r\nis spreading. Public disaffection has been manifest, and the\r\nentrenched political establishment has been shaken. This\r\ntrend has adversely affected the stability of the countries\r\nconcerned and complicated international relations.\r\nThe new international environment has led to an even\r\nmore dire plight for many developing countries. Increasing\r\nforeign intervention has heightened various internal factors\r\nof instability, thus compounding their difficulties. Their\r\nrights to independence, subsistence and development have\r\nbeen neither duly respected nor safeguarded. Therefore,\r\ninterference from the outside should cease, and the\r\ninternational community should give top priority to helping\r\nthose countries achieve political stability and overcome\r\neconomic difficulties. Lasting world peace and stability will\r\nremain elusive if the developing countries are still beset by\r\npersistent political unrest and if the North-South gap\r\ncontinues to widen.\r\nThere is no denying the fact that peace and\r\ndevelopment remain the overriding issues of our time. To\r\npreserve peace and accelerate development has become the\r\npressing demand of the people of all countries, but especially\r\nof those in the developing countries.\r\nThe world we live in is as diversified as ever. There\r\nare now more than 180 independent sovereign States, which\r\ndiffer not only in social systems but also in stages of\r\ndevelopment. Moreover, they have widely diverse\r\nideologies, cultural traditions, ethnic identities and religious\r\nfaiths. We should recognize and respect those differences\r\nand diversities, and treat each other as equal members of the\r\ninternational community. We should promote interchanges\r\nin the spirit of seeking common ground while setting aside\r\ndifferences. We should oppose any attempt to impose a\r\nparticular model on large numbers of countries, as diverse as\r\nthey are.\r\nWe believe that there can be genuine peace,\r\ninternational harmony and common development among\r\nStates only when international relations strictly conform to\r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nand are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence\r\nand other accepted norms of international conduct.\r\nIncreased economic and cultural interchanges between States\r\nhave deepened their interdependence. It is absolutely\r\nnecessary that States open up to each other; enhance\r\nexchanges, mutual understanding and cooperation; and share\r\nthe benefit of complementarity. But all this will be possible\r\nonly on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual\r\nbenefit.\r\nIn order to attain the overall objective of peace and\r\ndevelopment, the Chinese Government has on many\r\noccasions called for the establishment of a new international\r\npolitical and economic order of peace, stability, justice and\r\nrationality based on the Five Principles of Peaceful\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 19\r\nCoexistence and on the recognition of the diversity of the\r\nworld and of the differences among States. Under the new\r\norder, mutual respect and cooperation between States on an\r\nequal footing will replace hegemonism and power politics;\r\npeace talks, dialogue and consultations will replace the use\r\nor threat of force; and equality, mutual benefit and\r\naccommodation of each other’s needs will replace trade\r\nprotectionism and unequal exchanges. The Chinese\r\nGovernment is ready to cooperate extensively with all other\r\ncountries and will continue to make unremitting efforts for\r\nthe establishment of such a new order, and for peace and\r\ndevelopment of the world.\r\nThe report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277)\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General contains many important,\r\nthought-provokinq recommendations and ideas that deserve\r\ncareful consideration. We commend the Secretary-General\r\nfor his efforts therein. As a permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council, China has always supported the positive\r\nendeavours of the United Nations in preserving world peace\r\nand stability, promoting global development and resolving\r\ninternational disputes. We support the further enhancement\r\nand strengthening of the United Nations constructive role in\r\npreventive diplomacy, in peacemaking and peace-keeping on\r\nthe basis of the purposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nAs the frequency and scope of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations is growing, we deem it important\r\nand relevant to stress such basic principles of the Charter as\r\nrespect for the sovereignty of, and non-interference in, the\r\ninternal affairs of Member States. Those principles must be\r\nstrictly observed at all times when undertaking preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peace-keeping operations or post-conflict\r\npeace-building. Prior consent and pledges of cooperation by\r\nthe parties must be obtained, and strict impartiality should\r\nprevail in all peace-keeping missions. Only in this way can\r\nUnited Nations preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping\r\noperations fulfil the underlying purposes of the Charter and\r\nachieve the desired positive result.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of international disputes is an\r\nimportant principle of the Charter, one which we deem to be\r\nthe essence of preventive diplomacy. Everything should be\r\ndone to bring the opposing parties to the negotiating table\r\nbefore the outbreak of conflicts, so that they can start\r\nconsultations to achieve a peaceful settlement. All disputes\r\nbetween States, regional conflicts or even internal conflicts,\r\nhowever complex they may be, should be amenable to a\r\npolitical solution, and nothing should be done to aggravate\r\nthe situation.\r\nNot long ago, the Palestine Liberation Organization and\r\nthe Government of Israel signed an agreement on mutual\r\nrecognition and on the question of self-government for\r\nPalestinians. Although just a beginning, the move was a\r\nmajor breakthrough in the settlement of the Middle East\r\nquestion, which has dragged on for nearly half a century.\r\nThis agreement was the result of efforts by the international\r\ncommunity and by both Palestine and Israel to settle an\r\ninternational dispute by peaceful means. We sincerely\r\nwelcome and wish to express our congratulations at this\r\ndevelopment. We can see from this that as long as a\r\nglimmer of hope remains, one must not give up the pursuit\r\nof a peaceful settlement.\r\nNeedless to say, one should adopt a very serious\r\nattitude towards, and firmly oppose, any act of aggression\r\nthat tramples on the sovereignty of another country, such as\r\nlarger States bullying smaller ones or the strong lording it\r\nover the weak in the international arena. We disapprove of\r\nthe indiscriminate use of sanctions or force in the name of\r\nthe United Nations. We also believe that humanitarian\r\nmissions must not be transformed into military operations\r\nand that a war cannot be stopped by\r\nexpanding it.\r\nIt must be noted that in a world troubled by recurrent\r\nregional conflicts and interwoven contradictions, the United\r\nNations alone cannot hope to resolve all international\r\ndisputes. It has the duty to undertake this task and\r\nmaintain international peace and security. But regional\r\norganizations should also be taken into account and\r\nencouraged, as provided in Chapter VIII of the Charter, to\r\nassume greater responsibility and play a more active role in\r\nthis regard. In view of the proliferation of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations and the concomitant demands on\r\nthe Organization and Member States in terms of manpower,\r\nfinance and material resources, we deem it essential that the\r\nUnited Nations act within the limits of its means and\r\nenhance the cost-effectiveness of such operations.\r\nPeace and development are inseparable. Economic\r\ndevelopment cannot get off the ground without the\r\nprerequisites of peace and stability. On the other hand,\r\nunless there is sound economic development, there can\r\nhardly be secure or enduring peace and stability. We\r\nmaintain that the United Nations should meet the demands\r\nof the developing countries for social and economic\r\nadvancement and should give this very high priority. This\r\nis the way to make the United Nations an Organization that\r\nall the countries of the world will support and count on.\r\nThis is also the way to enhance further the role and prestige\r\nof the United Nations. Proceeding from this consideration,\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nwe in China have stepped up preparations for the fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women in Beijing, scheduled for\r\n1995. We also give vigorous support to the convening of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen\r\nthe same year.\r\nIt must be pointed out that unless the international\r\ncommunity helps the developing countries break loose\r\nquickly from poverty and backwardness, there can be no\r\nsustained growth or prosperity for all. Hence, we call upon\r\nthe developed countries to do more to curb trade\r\nprotectionism, contribute more funds for development and\r\nenvironmental protection, cut back debt burden, increase\r\nofficial development assistance, reduce restrictions on\r\ntechnology transfer and open their markets wider so as to\r\ncreate a favourable environment for the economic recovery\r\nand revitalization of the developing countries. This will\r\nprove a boon to the developed countries themselves. At a\r\ntime when the world economy has become increasingly\r\ninterrelated, the revitalization of the developing countries\r\nwill be a boost to the world and will spur to the economic\r\nrecovery and growth of the developed countries.\r\nSince the founding of the United Nations, tremendous\r\nchanges have taken place in the world and in the\r\nOrganization itself. United Nations membership has\r\nincreased from the original 51 to 184 now, the majority\r\nbeing developing countries. The Chinese Government is of\r\nthe view that, in keeping with developments, the United\r\nNations should be restructured, and the composition of the\r\nSecurity Council could be appropriately enlarged to enable\r\nthe Organization better to respond to the changes in the\r\nworld, meet the concerns and wishes of the membership and\r\nenhance its own role in international affairs. Reform of the\r\nSecurity Council should enable it better to discharge its\r\nmandate in accordance with the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter. It is the collective will and common aspiration\r\nof the membership that in the new circumstances the United\r\nNations should be better equipped to address major\r\ninternational issues vigorously and effectively and in a fair\r\nand balanced manner. Therefore, the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil and other United Nations organs should take due\r\naccount of the principle of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution and should accommodate the interests of the\r\ndeveloping countries which make up the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the membership. Since any reform would affect\r\nthe interests of all Member States and involve a revision of\r\nthe Charter, views from all quarters must be heard. The\r\nreform plan should undergo extensive discussions and\r\nconsultations by the membership and should be generally\r\nacceptable to all.\r\nThe Chinese Government has stated on many occasions\r\nthat China stands for the non-proliferation of all weapons of\r\nmass destruction. At the same time we hold that the\r\nultimate objective of mankind should be the complete\r\nprohibition and thorough destruction of those weapons. Now\r\nthat the Conventions banning biological and chemical\r\nweapons have been concluded, we deem it high time that the\r\ncomplete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear\r\nweapons were put on the agenda.\r\nThe international community has expressed concern\r\nover the issue of a nuclear-test ban. The Chinese\r\nGovernment has always stood for a total test ban within the\r\nframework of the complete prohibition and thorough\r\ndestruction of nuclear weapons. We support an early start\r\nto negotiations for a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty\r\nand will work in common with other countries towards a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear-test ban at an early date.\r\nChina has always exercised great restraint in nuclear\r\ntesting. The number of our tests is the smallest among all\r\nnuclear Powers. While a nuclear test ban is necessary, to\r\nundertake not to use nuclear weapons at all is far more\r\ncrucial, because this will not only make their testing,\r\ndevelopment, production or deployment devoid of any\r\nmeaning, but will give great impetus to nuclear disarmament,\r\nwhich will contribute tremendously to world peace and\r\nsecurity. If, however, complete prohibition and thorough\r\ndestruction of nuclear weapons cannot be achieved soon\r\nenough, then let the nuclear Powers reach an agreement not\r\nto be the first to use nuclear weapons and not to use them\r\nagainst non-nuclear-weapon States or nuclear-free zones.\r\nThis is entirely feasible and should be done as soon as\r\npossible. This will put nuclear Powers to the test to see\r\nwhether they are genuinely willing to treat non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States as equals. China long ago unilaterally under-\r\ntook not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time\r\nor under any circumstances, and not to use or threaten to use\r\nthem against any nuclear-free zone or non-nuclear-weapon\r\nState. We call upon all the other nuclear Powers to make\r\nthe same pledge and conclude an international convention to\r\nthis effect as soon as possible.\r\nNow there are international arrangements and\r\nconventions that are designed to control arms transfers and\r\nban certain types of weapons of mass destruction. Such\r\nconventions are aimed at maintaining international and\r\nregional peace, security and stability. The arrangements\r\ndesigned to control transfers of missile technology should\r\nalso take into account such elements as the arbitrary use of\r\nmissiles for attacks on other countries. Otherwise, such an\r\narrangement will become a means by which certain Powers\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 21\r\ncan maintain military superiority or play power politics. That\r\nis morally unjustifiable. We oppose the all-too-frequent\r\narbitrary use of sanctions by one country to bring pressure\r\nto bear on another under the pretext of controlling arms\r\ntransfers while engaging in massive arms sales of one’s own\r\nwhich jeopardize the sovereignty and security of the country\r\nconcerned. We also denounce the hegemonic conduct of a\r\nself-styled \"world cop\" that tramples upon international law\r\nand norms of international relations by endangering another\r\ncountry’s navigational safety and normal trading under the\r\npretext of enforcing the ban on chemical weapons and in\r\ndisregard of the provisions of the relevant international\r\nconventions.\r\nThanks to the policy of reform and opening to the\r\nworld, China’s economy has expanded considerably over the\r\npast 15 years and is now in high gear. Our gross national\r\nproduct rose 12.8 per cent last year, and the current year’s\r\ngrowth rate will again be in double digits. Our foreign trade\r\nand economic cooperation have been expanding rapidly.\r\nTotal trade volume in 1992 was a 5.2-fold increase over\r\n1978, the year before the start of the reform and opening-up,\r\nand represents an annual growth rate of 13.9 per cent.\r\nInvestments from overseas have flowed in rapidly. Nearly\r\n50,000 overseas-funded projects involving $58 billion were\r\napproved in 1992. The momentum has continued into the\r\ncurrent year. High-speed growth has helped basically solve\r\nthe problem of feeding and clothing a population of over 1.1\r\nbillion and put China on the road towards prosperity. It has\r\nalso boosted economic exchanges and cooperation with other\r\ncountries. This is good for both China and the world.\r\nBut we have encountered some problems as our\r\neconomy has picked up speed. These problems will be\r\nresolved by accelerating and deepening our reform. We\r\nhave taken a number of measures to strengthen\r\nmacro-control and readjust the economic structure to ensure\r\nhealthy, rapid and steady economic growth. We are fully\r\ncapable of attaining our objective. We are full of confidence\r\nin the future of our development programme.\r\nIt is an objective reality that China has indeed achieved\r\nimpressive economic success. But it does not tally with the\r\nfacts to exaggerate our economic strength. Given China’s\r\nvast land area, huge population and uneven economic\r\ndevelopment in different parts of the country, our per capita\r\ngross national product is still quite low. Ours is still a\r\ndeveloping country. It will require several generations\r\nworking very hard for many decades before we can attain\r\nthe level of an average developed country.\r\nAt this juncture, I would like to draw attention to\r\nassertions recently bruited about on the international scene:\r\nthat China’s economic success would entail a military\r\nbuild-up, or that China would move to \"fill up the vacuum\",\r\nthus constituting a threat, and so on and so forth. This is\r\nutterly groundless. A China with a burgeoning economy is\r\nan important factor contributing to the economic well-being\r\nof Asia and the world at large. The Chinese people had\r\nlong suffered under imperialist aggression, and it regained\r\nindependence only after horrible sacrifices in countless grim\r\nstruggles spanning more than a century. Nothing can make\r\nus forget the episodes of our history when our country was\r\nsubjected to foreign aggression, dismemberment and\r\nenslavement. Our ancient sage Confucius, that great thinker\r\nand statesman, admonished: \"Do not do unto others what\r\nyou would not like others to do unto you\".\r\nEven when China becomes more developed, we will\r\nnever engage in aggression or expansionism; nor will we\r\never seek hegemony. This is a pledge which has been\r\nenshrined in our Constitution and which has become part of\r\nour consistent and firm basic State policy. It has been borne\r\nout by facts that China is a staunch force for world peace\r\nand stability. Our limited defence capability is solely for\r\nself-defence purposes. Many of our military industrial plants\r\nhave been converted to civilian production. Our military\r\nexpenditures are the lowest among the major countries. We\r\nhave neither troops nor military bases on foreign territory.\r\nWe are immersed in economic construction. Therefore, we\r\nneed an international environment of enduring peace as well\r\nas long-term amicable relations with our neighbours. We are\r\nready to cultivate and strengthen similar relationships with\r\nall other countries on the basis of the five principles of\r\npeaceful coexistence.\r\nNo matter how the wind may change its direction on\r\nthe world scene, China will unswervingly play its part in\r\npreserving world peace and promoting common prosperity\r\nand development.\r\nMr. JUPPÉ (France) (interpretation from French): I\r\nshould like first to say, Mr. President, that France is pleased\r\nto see the General Assembly meeting under your guidance\r\nthis year. Your election is just testimony to the esteem in\r\nwhich the international community holds your country. It\r\nalso affords us the opportunity to welcome the \"silent\r\nrevolution\" that has been taking place in Latin America over\r\nthe past few years, which has put many States back on the\r\npath of national reconciliation, democracy and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe year which is ending will have been as rich in\r\npromise as it has been fraught with danger. Conflicts once\r\nthought to be insoluble suddenly seem to be on track\r\ntowards resolution. On behalf of my country, I should like\r\nto pay tribute to the men in the Middle East, in South Africa\r\nand in Cambodia who found the courage to take the path\r\ntowards reconciliation and peace: Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser\r\nArafat, F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, His Majesty\r\nKing Norodom Sihanouk and all those, known and unknown,\r\nwho accompanied or even preceded them on this courageous\r\npath.\r\nThe agreement between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) opens the way to the\r\nsettlement of a conflict which some had despaired of seeing\r\nresolved, and makes it possible to conceive of a radically\r\nnew future for the entire region. This revolution gives us\r\nnew reason to believe in human will and encourages us\r\nnever to consider the hope for peace as a chimera. From us,\r\nit calls for collective effort, including financial effort, in\r\norder to translate this hope into reality as soon as possible.\r\nIt also invites us to erase the aftermath of conflicts as\r\nreflected in past resolutions of this Assembly.\r\nBut the end of what was for years called the balance of\r\nterror has also led to new kinds of uncertainty and disorder.\r\nRussia is going through a political and economic\r\ntransition that could lead to serious internal difficulties, as\r\nthe events of the past few days have shown. In that context,\r\nI should like to reaffirm France’s support for the process of\r\ndemocratization and reform courageously undertaken by\r\nPresident Yeltsin.\r\nIn the former Yugoslavia war has been raging for two\r\nyears, with its attendant death, suffering and destruction.\r\nOther regions in Africa, Central Asia, the Balkans and the\r\nCaucasus are falling or could fall victim to this new type of\r\nconflict, resulting from the break-up of States and the\r\nresurgence of nationalist, ethnic or religious passions.\r\nElsewhere, States put under a sanctions regime by our\r\nOrganization for failing to comply with the obligations of\r\ninternational law or with commitments they have made\r\npersist in refusing to take the measures that would permit\r\nthem to regain their place in the international community.\r\nAlmost everywhere, the proliferation of weapons is a\r\nfearsome factor for instability.\r\nIn the face of the promises and dangers I have just\r\noutlined, France bases its foreign policy on a few guiding\r\nprinciples. Whether they are found reassuring or disturbing,\r\nI should like to recall them to the Assembly.\r\nThe first principle is the desire for independence.\r\nFrance has amply demonstrated that it is ready to act in\r\nconcert with others where the ends are genuinely collective.\r\nBut, needless to say, it does so in complete sovereignty.\r\nExercising freedom of judgement and choice, France refuses\r\nto follow the orthodoxy of the moment or to succumb to\r\npressures resulting from relative material strengths.\r\nThe second principle, shared by many in this Hall, is a\r\ncommitment to our fundamental interests. Like every other\r\nState in this Organization, France has its own strategic,\r\ncommercial and cultural interests which it seeks to preserve.\r\nWhile we are open to negotiation and to the mutual\r\nconcessions it implies, we cannot be made to give up\r\nanything we consider to be an essential element of our\r\nsecurity, our prosperity or our culture.\r\nThe third principle is devotion to law and justice.\r\nBeyond its own interests, France aspires to help ensure that\r\ncertain fundamental principles first inspired by France,\r\namong others, triumph throughout the world: the right of\r\npeoples to self-determination and security, human rights and\r\nthe right to development.\r\nFinally, one last aspect of our diplomacy, in the service\r\nof the others, is France’s perseverance, and at times\r\nstubbornness. May I recall our resolve - despite obstacles -\r\nin opening up the path that would eventually lead to the\r\nrestoration of peace in Cambodia, and our determination to\r\nsee institutional legality restored in Haiti.\r\nThese unchanging principles dictate the two main lines\r\nof the policy which my country hopes to implement on the\r\ninternational stage.\r\nOur ambition concerns Europe first of all.\r\nWhatever the present difficulties, whatever the\r\nprevailing scepticism, France will not falter in its resolve to\r\nbuild with its neighbours a strong, prosperous, democratic\r\nand generous Europe, capable of making its voice heard and\r\nof contributing to world peace. This is an irrevocable choice\r\nfor us because the peoples of Europe need a plan that brings\r\nthem together, and European unity is the only goal that\r\nmeasures up to the values they share. Moreover, the\r\nbuilding of a united Europe is the only way to avert the\r\ndangers threatening our continent at this time: dangers\r\narising from the resurgence of the most implacable forms of\r\nnationalism and from the persistence of unacceptable\r\neconomic disparities. Europe’s success will serve as an\r\nexample for other regions of the world as did in its day the\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 23\r\nreconciliation between France and Germany sought by\r\nGeneral de Gaulle and Chancellor Adenauer.\r\nI have already spoken of the conflict raging in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia.\r\nFrance has spared no effort to put an end to it. As you\r\nknow, France initiated most of the Security Council\r\nresolutions designed to discourage or punish aggressors.\r\nTogether with its partners, France provides an essential part\r\nof the humanitarian aid sent there. Its soldiers represent the\r\nlargest of the contingents made available to the United\r\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), and more than a\r\ndozen of them have paid for their generous presence there\r\nwith their lives. It has so far been the only country to send\r\nreinforcements in accordance with resolution 836 (1993) in\r\norder to contribute to the security of the protected areas and\r\nthe Muslim populations there. France was, as well, the first\r\nnation to deplore the inadequacy of the actions taken by the\r\ninternational community in regard to the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe efforts it has made entitled it to tell those who have\r\nbeen free with their advice and lessons that they might be\r\nbetter heard if they were agreeing, when they are able to do\r\nso, to commit their own troops to the field. Once in contact\r\nwith the realities of the situation, they would undoubtedly\r\nbetter appreciate the fact that between negotiated peace and\r\nchaos there is no middle ground.\r\nLet us learn the lessons of this painful experience. It\r\nis essential for us to acquire the means to avoid the\r\nrepetition of such a conflict, and to ensure, without waiting\r\nfor future progress in the construction of a united Europe,\r\nthat preventive diplomacy, military openness and respect for\r\nthe rule of law prevail wherever latent tensions remain. This\r\nis the intent of the proposed pact on European stability\r\nwhich France has submitted to its European partners and to\r\nwhich it would like to associate Russia, as well as its allies\r\nacross the Atlantic, Canada and the United States.\r\nEurope is, of course, far from being the sole horizon of\r\nFrance’s action. My country has long-standing, close\r\nrelations with many parts of the world. For the long-term\r\norganization of the international scene in the aftermath of the\r\ncold war, France naturally turns to the United Nations.\r\nBecause it believes in the mission of the United\r\nNations, France wants a strong and effective Organization.\r\nThis goal involves, first of all, the reforming of the\r\nSecurity Council. Its enlargement, which has become\r\nnecessary today in the light of the world’s evolution, must\r\nbe envisioned as the way to increase its effectiveness.\r\nFrance understands and supports the aspirations of some\r\nof its partners to exercise their international responsibilities\r\nmore actively, provided that they are ready to commit\r\nthemselves in the field. However, the expansion of the\r\nCouncil should not be achieved at the expense of one or\r\nanother group of States; in particular, it must preserve the\r\ncapacity of the developing countries to make their voices\r\nheard. In our view, this is an essential requirement.\r\nIn their wisdom, those who drafted the Charter\r\nrecognized that only a group of limited size could take\r\nprompt measures to restore peace when confronted with an\r\nurgent crisis. We should therefore take care that the\r\nprojected enlargement does not lead to a paralysis of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nFrance hopes that at its present session the General\r\nAssembly will decide to open discussions on ways to reform\r\nthe Security Council. A solution will have to be found that\r\nreconciles the will to reform with the desire for\r\neffectiveness. This is why enlargement, in our view, will\r\nhave to be decided according to a formula combining new\r\npermanent members and additional non-permanent members.\r\nThe Secretary-General is a key institution of the United\r\nNations. France would like him to be given the means to\r\ncarry through the innovative action he has undertaken.\r\nAllow me to pay a tribute to the energy, authority and\r\ncourage with which our Secretary-General is carrying out his\r\nmissions.\r\nFrance approves not only of his political initiatives but\r\nalso of his tireless efforts to rationalize the functioning of\r\nour Organization. We must combat the proliferation of\r\ninstitutions, which consumes our resources and threatens the\r\ncoherence of our efforts. We must improve the coordination\r\nof activities linked to development and restore to the\r\nEconomic and Social Council its role as a provider of\r\nstimulus and organization. We must combat administrative\r\nwaste wherever it exists, without hesitating to punish any\r\nabuses that may be uncovered. Lastly, we must have more\r\nsupervision and greater transparency in peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nThe Secretary-General still does not have all the means\r\nto exercise his responsibility to the full. France calls on the\r\nMember States to provide him with those means without\r\ndelay. Strengthening the Department of Peace-keeping\r\nOperations, establishing a mechanism for a true general\r\ninspection, and setting up a court for budgetary discipline\r\nare, in our eyes, indispensable measures.\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe third requirement for strengthening the\r\nOrganization is a clean-up of its finances.\r\nPerhaps I should have begun with this point.\r\nAccording to an old French saying, money is \"the sinew of\r\nwar\". It is also the sinew of peace. Our projects for this\r\nOrganization will be no more than empty words unless we\r\nhave the courage to adopt the new measures that its financial\r\nbankruptcy requires.\r\nFirst, Member States which do not pay their\r\ncontributions within 30 days following the\r\nSecretary-General’s call for contributions should be\r\npenalized. France proposes that market-rate interest should\r\nbe imposed on all late payments. This firm stance seems\r\nparticularly necessary because the payment of accumulated\r\narrears alone would suffice to resolve the financial crisis. It\r\nis also consistent with considerations of fairness and political\r\nmorality. One cannot simultaneously speak of United\r\nNations reform, justice and international development and\r\nexempt oneself from the primary financial obligation\r\nresulting from adherence to our Charter. It is high time to\r\nmeasure the generosity of words against the yardstick of\r\narrears due our Organization.\r\nThe establishment of a mechanism for a true general\r\ninspection will, as I have said, make it possible to rationalize\r\nthe functioning and costs of the United Nations. France will\r\nsupport all initiatives to supplement the existing procedures\r\nof internal assessment, which have already shown their\r\nlimitations despite the judicious reorganization recently\r\nintroduced by the Secretary-General.\r\nLastly, we must adopt an exemplary budget for the\r\n1994-1995 period. We must not hesitate to reduce\r\nexpenditures for obsolete activities. We will also have to\r\nprovide sufficient funding for the new mandates entrusted to\r\nthe Organization. If, from that, it is necessary to consider a\r\nreasonable increase in the ordinary budget, France, which\r\nhas never espoused a dogmatic idea of zero growth, will\r\nreadily accept this.\r\nThese are concrete measures. They require a collective\r\neffort on the part of Member States. But France is\r\nconvinced that we can no longer be satisfied, as in previous\r\nyears, with marginal adjustments. The very ability of the\r\nUnited Nations to carry out its mandate is at stake.\r\nFrance, as you will have realized, is ambitious for the\r\nUnited Nations. With the support of renovated institutions\r\nand reorganized financing, the United Nations will be able\r\nto meet the great responsibilities incumbent on it: to preserve\r\npeace and collective security, to promote development and\r\nto address global problems whose international scale\r\nremoves them from the individual action of States.\r\nPeace is of course the first of our responsibilities.\r\nThe present instability in several parts of the world\r\ncompels the United Nations to intervene more and more\r\nfrequently in order to check the spread of conflicts and allow\r\na negotiated solution to be sought. France, for its part, has\r\nwished to participate fully in this effort and is today in the\r\nfront rank of States participating in peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nThis commitment obviously does not confer any\r\nprivilege on us. But our experience enables us to cast a lucid\r\neye over the operations in which we have participated and\r\nencourages us to reaffirm certain principles and to propose\r\ncertain common-sense measures that might help increase the\r\nfuture effectiveness of our action.\r\nFirst, greater political control is needed over operations\r\nthat have become increasingly complex. Purely military\r\nconsiderations should never thwart - or even obscure -\r\npolitical ends. Naturally, regional or defence organizations\r\nmay make useful contributions in terms of expertise,\r\npersonnel or matériel. But the use of force presupposes that\r\nthe guardian of the law - that is, the Security Council -\r\nexercises its authority in the name of the international\r\ncommunity. This it cannot relinquish. That is why France\r\ninsisted that the Secretary-General’s Special Representative\r\nto the former Yugoslavia should have authority over all\r\noperations under international mandate. It is important, it\r\nseems to me, that we should maintain this requirement at all\r\ntimes. By the same token, France insists that the political\r\nends of the operation in Somalia should not be lost sight of.\r\nNext, we should systematically consider the question of\r\nthe timetable of operations.\r\nAs a matter of principle, time-frames should be\r\nexplicitly assigned to each operation in the actual resolution\r\nthat institutes it. It is also important to know when to\r\nterminate operations that go on and on, needlessly dipping\r\ninto the means of the Organization and its Member States.\r\nFrance fully supports the Secretary-General’s efforts on this\r\nscore.\r\nLastly, we must expand the capacity of the\r\nOrganization to react. The time that elapses between our\r\ndecision to create a force and the implementation of that\r\ndecision is far too long. How many weeks did we have to\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 25\r\nwait before the air power authorized by resolution\r\n836 (1993) on Bosnia was eventually deployed? And how\r\nmany weeks for the ground reinforcements that had been\r\nannounced to reach Sarajevo?\r\nWe cannot but note that the current procedures do not\r\nmeet the criteria for rapid reaction and flexible use which\r\nare called for in this area.\r\nFrance does not, however, believe that the Organization\r\nshould have its own force. On the other hand, it has\r\nparticipated in discussions organized by the\r\nSecretariat-General on the concept of stand-by units. These\r\ndiscussions have resulted in original proposals for \"tailor-\r\nmade\" forces for the United Nations. In this way, the\r\nOrganization could have at its disposal support, transport and\r\ncommunications capabilities which it currently lacks for\r\ncarrying out military actions speedily.\r\nFrance, which has already offered, in a statement made\r\nby the President of the French Republic, to make available\r\nto the Secretary-General a 1,000-strong contingent for peace-\r\nkeeping operations at 48 hours’ notice, will take part in this\r\neffort.\r\nThese measures will have another advantage. They will\r\nadd an extra degree of effectiveness to preventive diplomacy,\r\nwhich has to be central to the ambitions we have for the\r\nOrganization. This policy requires us to develop and put in\r\nplace mechanisms for crisis alert, evaluation and prevention.\r\nSeveral ideas were put forward in the \"Agenda for\r\nPeace\" - they included use of fact-finding missions and the\r\neffective deployment of United Nations forces - and have\r\nalready been applied to certain difficult situations in Africa,\r\nCentral Asia and the Balkans.\r\nIn this spirit, the United Kingdom and France are ready\r\nto submit to the Secretary-General proposals for compiling\r\na list of prominent individuals who could intervene promptly\r\nat his request, in liaison with appropriate regional\r\norganizations, and provide them with equipment -\r\nspecifically in the communications field - necessary for\r\ncarrying out their mission completely.\r\nIt is through concrete initiatives of this sort, which may\r\nseem modest at first, that preventive diplomacy will\r\ngradually assume its rightful place in the maintenance of\r\npeace.\r\nThe effort made in relation to disarmament in the past\r\nfew years, finally, should continue.\r\nConsiderable progress has already been made with the\r\nreduction of stockpiles from the cold-war era. But a new\r\npriority is becoming evident: the struggle against the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. To attain this\r\ngoal, we must be extremely vigilant in the threefold domain\r\nof nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and ballistic\r\ntechnologies.\r\nIn this light, France welcomes the signing in Paris by\r\nnearly 150 States of the Convention banning chemical\r\nweapons, the first real multilateral disarmament pact of\r\ngeneral scope, and calls on the States which have not yet\r\nratified this Convention to do so. It supports the efforts\r\nbeing made by several groups of countries to institute\r\nsystems of control of missile technology, nuclear exports and\r\nthe sale of so-called sensitive products.\r\nFrance asks, finally, that the non-proliferation regimes\r\nbe strengthened. It reaffirms in particular its desire to see\r\nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty prolonged indefinitely and\r\nunconditionally. It continues to believe that it is only the\r\nSecurity Council that can decide on sanctions against\r\nirresponsible behaviour. This would be the case if North\r\nKorea were to fail to respect its commitments to the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nWhat guarantees can be given for collective security\r\nand peace if nothing is done to try to resolve the economic\r\nand social disparities that are so often the source of conflict?\r\nWe know that there can be no lasting peace without lasting\r\neconomic development. That is why the \"Agenda for Peace\"\r\nunquestionably requires also an \"agenda for development\".\r\nFrance, as is known, has consistently spoken for the\r\ninterests of the developing countries, particularly the least\r\ndeveloped, in discussion with its industrialized partners. It\r\nhas tirelessly pleaded - sometimes as a voice crying in the\r\nwilderness - for a substantial increase in the level of official\r\ndevelopment assistance in order to permit these countries to\r\nenjoy trade advantages without reciprocity, to ease their debt\r\nburden and stabilize raw-material prices. Our resolve in this\r\nmatter will not weaken: how can we accept, for example, a\r\nsituation in which every year the African countries pay the\r\nWorld Bank more than they receive from it?\r\nNor can we accept the persistence, and sometimes the\r\nworsening, of the most glaring situations of distress. France\r\nhas not forgotten the depth of the crisis in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica, with which it has so many ties. It believes it is\r\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nessential that the basic achievements of cooperation between\r\nthe European Community and the African, Caribbean and\r\nPacific countries, should be maintained, especially with\r\nregard to trade.\r\nLastly, our third ambition for the United Nations\r\nconcerns the vast issue of societal questions, linked naturally\r\nto the requirements of development but distinct from it.\r\nThe protection of human rights, the preservation of the\r\nenvironment, aid to refugees, the struggle against full-scale\r\nepidemics, organized crime and drug trafficking all have a\r\nworldwide dimension. The Organization must address these\r\nproblems with the same energy it expends in the search for\r\npeace and the promotion of development.\r\nSeveral important dates lie ahead of us. Let us apply\r\nwithout delay the recommendations unanimously adopted at\r\nthe Vienna Conference on Human Rights, particularly the\r\ncreation of a post of high commissioner for human rights.\r\nLet us prepare for the conferences in Cairo and Beijing and\r\nthe social development summit in Copenhagen with all the\r\nnecessary determination, so as to reinforce the cooperation\r\nrequired in addressing demographic problems, the promotion\r\nof women’s rights and the demands for social development.\r\nGreat epidemics have always been a threat to the\r\nworld’s nations. But the need for full-scale international\r\nmobilization is becoming particularly acute in the case of\r\nAIDS in view of the havoc of all kinds caused by the spread\r\nof this malady. I earnestly hope that, as we approach the\r\nsecond decade of this struggle, the coherence of United\r\nNations action, and that of its specialized agencies and of all\r\nStates and interested organizations, will be equal to this new\r\nchallenge. In this context, France proposes the convening of\r\na conference next year to bring together the main contributor\r\ncountries in the war against this scourge in order to improve\r\ncoordination of their efforts and give them a new impetus.\r\nIn most cases, these phenomena are not new. However,\r\nthe challenge they pose to our societies, in the North and in\r\nthe South, is of unprecedented seriousness. They affect\r\nunderdevelopment as much as they do the excesses of the\r\nconsumer society, and our traditional responses are proving\r\nto be inadequate or ineffective. We need new ideas in this\r\narea. The Secretary-General should have broad power to\r\ntake initiatives and make proposals in this matter. France\r\ntherefore suggests the formation of a group of prominent\r\nfigures chosen for their intellectual and scientific abilities\r\nand moral influence to assist him in this vital task at the end\r\nof our century.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 27\r\nSetting forth such ambitions for the United Nations\r\nmight have made the sceptics smile a few years ago. With\r\nthe end of the cold war the international community has a\r\nhistoric opportunity: no longer to dismiss problems but\r\nperhaps to solve them; no longer to limit conflicts but\r\nperhaps to settle them.\r\nLet us remain clear-sighted. This period could be\r\nmerely a brief interlude. If we were to hesitate, would it be\r\nlong before peoples succumbed to their basest inclinations,\r\ncast off the rules of international law or put themselves - in\r\nthe best of cases - under the sole protection of regional,\r\ncompeting and potentially hostile solidarities?\r\nWe do not have unlimited time. It is therefore our duty\r\nto undertake without delay the reforms required to strengthen\r\nour Organization and to realize its new objectives.\r\nI should like to assure the Assembly that in the pursuit\r\nof these twin goals, the United Nations can count on\r\nFrance’s firm resolve.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
