In a\r\nletter contained in that document the Secretary-General\r\ninforms me that since the issuance of his communications\r\ndated 21, 24 and 27 September 1993 Mali has made the\r\nnecessary payment to reduce its arrears below the amount\r\nspecified in Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly duly takes note of this\r\ninformation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nADDRESS BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESIDENT\r\nO F T H E R E P U B L I C O F B O L I V I A ,\r\nMR. GONZALO SANCHEZ DE LOZADA\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bolivia.\r\nMr. Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bolivia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I have the honor to welcome\r\nto the United Nations the Constitutional President of the\r\nRepublic of Bolivia, His Excellency Mr. Gonzalo Sanchez\r\nde Lozada, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident SANCHEZ de LOZADA (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I should like to extend greetings to the President\r\nof the General Assembly, Ambassador Samuel Insanely of\r\nGuyana, to the former President, Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria,\r\nand to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. I\r\ncongratulate them on their active commitment to the\r\nprinciples of peace, justice, human development and\r\ninternational law.\r\nI should also like to greet the Heads of State and\r\nrepresentatives of Member States who are gathered here in\r\nthis historic Hall.\r\nDespite having the seventh highest rate of\r\nhyperinflation in the history of mankind, Bolivia has been a\r\npioneer in the structural reforms that began in 1985 with the\r\nadvent of democracy and freedom - reforms that were\r\ncarried out without limiting human rights but by making\r\nmajor sacrifices. I should like to take this opportunity to\r\npay a tribute to the President of our country during that\r\nperiod, Dr. Victor Paz Estenssoro and, on behalf of all\r\nBolivians, to pay a special tribute to his statesmanlike\r\nleadership.\r\nIn retrospect, this may not seem so great a task:\r\nReining in the economic crisis and bringing about peaceful\r\nThis record is subject to correction.\r\nCorrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned\r\nwithin one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,\r\nRoom C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.\r\nCorrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n93-86635 (E)\r\nDistr. GENERAL\r\nA/48/PV.9\r\n13 October 1993\r\nENGLISH\r\n2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nchange in conditions of freedom and liberty are activities\r\nthat are being accomplished in many countries in Latin\r\nAmerica and elsewhere in the world. The situation in\r\nRussia, for example, reminds us of the difficulty of\r\nachieving consensus and legitimacy in governing a society\r\nin crisis, a society in which change is necessary.\r\nBolivia’s course has required daring and imagination.\r\nWe have not shrunk from calling upon our people to make\r\nsacrifices and shoulder additional burdens. But we are\r\nprofoundly alarmed, however, when we see so many\r\ncountries embarking on the road to democracy and change\r\nand attempting to achieve stable growth and development\r\nwith social justice and when we then note that no\r\ncorresponding efforts are being made in the developed\r\nworld.\r\nThe end of the cold war lit a beacon of hope, but we\r\nare surprised that it has not engendered an increase in\r\ninternational cooperation and solidarity. There was greater\r\ncooperation during the era of confrontation because of the\r\ndesire to defend third-world countries against the communist\r\nthreat and to replace the cold war with relations built on\r\nsolidarity and development. Today, on the contrary, poor\r\ncountries are faced with cuts in assistance, the prices of our\r\nraw materials continue to plummet, and protectionism is on\r\nthe rise. Indeed, in real terms the current prices of tin,\r\ntungsten, antimony, coffee, rubber and petroleum are even\r\nlower than they were in 1930, during the great depression.\r\nIt is difficult to see on this bleak horizon how we are\r\ngoing to solve our problems: the migration from rural to\r\nurban areas, and from cities to the developed world; the\r\nincrease in drug trafficking and the phenomenon of poor\r\npeople being virtually forced to destroy nature in order to\r\nsurvive. That creates a vicious circle, with ever-deepening\r\npoverty.\r\nThe paradox of our times is that, in a world that is\r\ngrowing ever richer in overall terms, poverty is on the\r\nincrease. There is a wider disparity between the \"haves\" and\r\nthe \"have nots\". The precarious stability born of internal\r\nsocial and economic deficiencies must be tackled by all of\r\nus. There is also an urgent need for basic changes in how\r\nwe face the problem of solidarity and the development of the\r\ncommunity of nations and human societies.\r\nDeveloped countries must realize that sooner or later\r\nthe present situation rewards no one and injures everyone.\r\nI truly believe that we must have a clear awareness of the\r\nfact that population growth, the doubling of the population,\r\nthe destruction of the environment, the production of illegal\r\ndrugs and the trafficking in them, the migration from poor\r\ncountries to rich countries are problems that will affect not\r\nonly those countries but the world at large.\r\nThe solution is greater development. We know that\r\nwhen people’s incomes rise, when women are educated and\r\nwhen there is social justice, population growth rates also\r\nchange.\r\nWe know that in order to restore balance between the\r\nenvironment and society we need educated people who can\r\nput to use their special heritage and knowledge of living in\r\nharmony with nature - as is the case in our country.\r\nJust as we had to learn that nature can punish us when\r\nwe harm it, the time has come for all of us, developed and\r\nundeveloped, to become aware that it is unacceptable that\r\nthe rich of the world should become ever more wealthy\r\nwhile the poor are becoming poorer.\r\nAs we know, the solution is not just to hand out money\r\nor aid. But there is no other way to achieve our goal if we\r\ndo not change old ideas. The motto should be \"Trade, not\r\naid\". Yet it would seem that the fate of the underdeveloped\r\nworld is \"no trade and no aid\", which is absolutely\r\nunacceptable to us all if we wish to create a new, more just\r\nand peaceful society.\r\nWith the passing of time solutions will be even more\r\ncostly and more difficult in human terms and in social and\r\neconomic terms. What we need, I believe, is greater\r\nforesight on the part of those who are guiding the world’s\r\ndestiny. They must find solutions that are truly effective.\r\nI am not saying that we should repeat the past. But in\r\nthe past there were plans such as the Marshall Plan that\r\nhelped donors and recipients alike. We need similar\r\napproaches. We look forward with great expectation to the\r\nfree trade agreement among Canada, the United States and\r\nMexico. We congratulate President Clinton on his\r\ncommitment to struggling against the forces of protectionism\r\nin his country and elsewhere in North America to trying to\r\nforge ahead.\r\nAs a small developing country, Bolivia views all this\r\nwith hope, and as a commitment that we will be able to sell\r\nour products to the developing countries rather than only\r\nsending them people.\r\nWe look forward to a speedy and successful conclusion\r\nof the Uruguay Round, as we believe that the freedom of\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 3\r\nopportunity to produce is the only hope for our societies.\r\nThe children of the world ask only that their parents be able\r\nto work and bring home their daily bread. But that happens\r\nonly when a country - a society, a world - stands together\r\nand gives everyone equal access and opportunity.\r\nWe are not asking for special treatment; we are not\r\nasking just for help. We are asking to be allowed to work\r\nand to export, and not to be obliged just to export the most\r\ntalented and vigorous people of our societies to the\r\ndeveloped world.\r\nIn Bolivia we are trying to forge ahead with projects\r\nusing foreign capital and the participation of our people. We\r\nare a very poor people. Our country knows that it needs\r\ntechnology and capital, and during the coming years we\r\nhope to embark on an ambitious but feasible plan.\r\nThis plan has three pillars: capitalization,\r\ndemocratization and popular participation.\r\nFirst, we wish to invite foreign capital to come to\r\ndevelop technology and use fresh resources in order to\r\nenrich the heritage of our State enterprises. We do not want\r\nto sell our heritage, and we do not want only the\r\nparticipation of States.\r\nSecondly, 50 per cent of those enterprises and\r\n50 per cent of the stock must be owned by all Bolivians so\r\nthat these Bolivians can participate in the enterprises and\r\nfeel included in the process of economic development.\r\nThirdly, many people ask \"How can we give free goods\r\nto uneducated people who do not know how to read or write,\r\nwho have different ethnic and cultural backgrounds?\" The\r\ntruth is that in Bolivia many people do not know how to\r\nread but do know how to count. They know what it means\r\nto participate. They know what it means to feel they are\r\ntaking part in the fortunes of the country. With their\r\nparticipation we wish to bring to poor neighbourhoods and\r\ncommunities the health and education the people there need\r\nso that they can share in management.\r\nThe coming millennium will no longer find that\r\nrepresentative democracy is enough. It must be participatory\r\ndemocracy. People want to participate and they will do so\r\nvery well when it comes to matters that directly affect their\r\nlives and futures.\r\nWe believe that with participation of this kind our\r\nsocieties’ meagre resources will yield greater productivity.\r\nDemand will grow, which will make it possible for our\r\nsocieties to forge ahead.\r\nBut in Bolivia participation is not a mere word. For the\r\nfirst time in 500 years, a man has emerged from an\r\nindigenous ethnic group to become Acting President of our\r\ncountry. To the Bolivian people Victor Hugo Cárdenas is\r\nnot only an Aimara Indian, a person from the countryside,\r\nbut a great professional and outstanding intellectual. He\r\ntypifies our desire that all of our citizens take part in our\r\nsociety. We want to do away with age-old injustices. We\r\nwant to bring about change - to bring people in, not keep\r\nthem out. We want to create unity while respecting the\r\ndiversity of opinion not only on ecology and the\r\nenvironment but also on cultural, geographical and racial\r\nproblems.\r\nWe believe that this determination to include - not\r\nexclude -people is helping build a society in which there is\r\nchange with order, and order with change. And although we\r\nare among the poorest countries in Latin America - indeed,\r\nin the world - we believe that we stand as an example of the\r\nfact that it is possible to live with social peace and to regain\r\nstability, growth and social justice within the general\r\nframework of a democratic society. In Bolivia, democracy\r\nworks because people seek consensus; they seek respect;\r\nand they are accepting of diversity.\r\nThis process should allow us to arrive at a situation\r\nconducive to dealing with employment, education and health\r\ncare, and, most importantly, the rural sector, where the\r\ngreatest degree of poverty prevails and where the people are\r\namong the poorest in the world.\r\nDynamic growth would, of course, reduce the need to\r\ncultivate coca leaves. We in Bolivia have succeeded in\r\nreducing by 50 percent the amount of land used for the\r\ncultivation of these leaves. We accomplished this without\r\nthe guerrilla violence that accompanies narcotrafficking, and\r\nwithout the cartels that are in place in the country. While\r\nwe are undoubtedly making progress in this area, we are\r\nwell aware of the fact that the only alternative development\r\nactivity to this is light industry for export purposes. There\r\nis no use telling the Bolivian peasant, as I said earlier, to\r\nstop producing drugs and instead plant coffee when the price\r\nof coffee has dropped to half its former price, or to produce\r\ncacao when no one wants cacao - or rubber. Experience of\r\nalternative crops emphasizes the vital importance of enabling\r\ncountries such as Bolivia - especially Bolivia - to export\r\ntheir products to the developed countries in the form of\r\nmanufactured goods, rather than having them export the\r\nscourge of harmful drugs to the rest of humankind. We will\r\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncontinue, nevertheless, to fight against drug trafficking\r\nbecause we have made a commitment not only to our people\r\nbut also to humankind. Though we are poor, we are very\r\nhappy to see that new efforts are being made to reduce\r\ndemand. What we want to do is reduce supply. We wish\r\nto eliminate this business, with all its attendant dangers -\r\nsocial, moral, legal and institutional. Indeed, we have\r\nchosen the zero-option. We expect to be successful, with or\r\nwithout help. But we are more likely to be successful if we\r\nenjoy the support, cooperation and understanding of the rest\r\nof the world, which is, after all, affected by this terrible\r\nscourge.\r\nOurs is an ambitious project, to be sure, but it is\r\nfeasible. We recognize that the principal responsibility for\r\nthis plan rests with Bolivians. We are not just waiting for\r\nsomeone to help us. No, we know what all the peoples of\r\nthe world know, that hunger cannot wait, that solutions have\r\nto be found by oneself. But, in all sincerity, I think it will\r\nbe very difficult to overcome these problems without\r\ninternational cooperation. There must be some signal from\r\nthe outside that assistance will not come to an end as\r\nbarriers to trade mount.\r\nBolivia has made a great commitment to the\r\nenvironment. We have done so because our poverty stems\r\npartly from our neglect of this problem. We have allowed\r\npoverty increasingly to justify destruction of our natural\r\nresources in our daily activities. We do have a great plan -\r\na plan of international significance, not just to resolve our\r\nbalance-of-payments problems, not just to create an\r\nindustrial centre that could be the basis of the energy that we\r\nneed, but to see to it that environmental pollution is reduced.\r\nThat plan calls for construction, with Brazil, of a pipeline\r\nthat would bring Bolivian gas to the San Pablo market.\r\nWith cheap, non-polluting energy, used in industry and in\r\ncars, we can contribute to fundamentally reducing pollution\r\nin Latin America at its source, for the benefit and\r\ndevelopment of Bolivia, Brazil and the entire world.\r\nHuman rights must be the emblem of the new world\r\ncommunity, and we must see to it that the right to\r\ndevelopment within social justice is achievable. It is not just\r\na gift that we are asking for. We are asking for an\r\nopportunity. The United Nations is changing. It has to\r\nchange; the world has changed. After the great\r\nconfrontation of the cold-war period, we must deal with all\r\nthe harm this war caused, especially in the Third World.\r\nWe have to reorient global solidarity, not just in terms of\r\nassistance, but we must accept a concept that is truly very\r\nsimple and logical. Some countries become rich when they\r\ndo business, when they engage in trade with other rich\r\ncountries. To believe that a man is rich because everybody\r\nelse is poor is a holdover from the past. The great lesson of\r\nour time is that the only way to generate wealth is to help\r\npeople break the shackles of poverty.\r\nWe welcome the agreement between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization. It marks the beginning of\r\na new era of peace and of a new spirit of global justice and\r\ndialogue between nations facing historic circumstances. The\r\nmutual recognition of the inadmissibility of acquiring\r\nterritory through war is a great stride forward, as is the great\r\nand historic lesson that, even in regions where territorial\r\ndisputes so stubbornly persist, civilized dialogue, common\r\nsense and humanity can yield results and can bring people\r\ntogether rather than keeping them apart.\r\nRecently, in the heart of Latin America, we reunited\r\ntwo countries - Paraguay and Bolivia - that 61 years ago\r\nwere split apart by war and have now decided to forge a\r\ncommon destiny. This has had a great impact on us,\r\nbecause, since the handshake - since the agreement between\r\nthe two countries - in our country the veterans of the Chaco\r\nwar have marched carrying the flag of Paraguay. If those\r\nwho fought, whose comrades died, are prepared to forget,\r\nhow could we not do likewise?\r\nThese enlightening examples of how the most bitter\r\nconflicts can be resolved evoke in us a sincere desire that\r\nthe same spirit should guide the search for a final solution\r\nto Bolivia’s land-locked status, which has lasted 114 long\r\nyears. Many people say: \"How can you be claiming\r\nsomething that you lost 114 years ago?\" I reply that we\r\nhave a great deal of patience; our people waited 500 years\r\nfor their lands to be given back to them, for them to win\r\nback their country and their right to participate in society.\r\nI believe that injustice is not prescribed for us; we shall\r\ncontinue to make our claim, through the use of reason and\r\nnever by force. We shall continue to claim our right of\r\naccess to the sea until it is granted, until the sea runs dry.\r\nWhen it does, there will be no further problem and we\r\nshall make no further claims, but I believe that it really\r\nwould be an affront to go on blocking this historic coming\r\ntogether - which two fraternal peoples are demanding - if at\r\nthe Government level, at the level of leadership, we continue\r\nto discuss something to which both countries already want\r\nto find a solution. Solutions are possible; miracles do\r\nhappen, but we have seen that miracles are the result of\r\nwork and imagination, and in this we are committed, without\r\naggressiveness, coolly and calmly, to doing whatever we\r\ncan, as creatively as we can manage, to find solutions that\r\nwill meet the challenge and the expectations of this new\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 5\r\nworld in which we are living, and to bring about the change\r\nthat we require.\r\nIn these times of change, we must rely on our own\r\ncreativity. We know the importance of one’s own efforts.\r\nBut at the same time we want others in this world to stand\r\nby us in solidarity, and at least give us the opportunity to\r\nshow what we can do.\r\nAnd we must move ahead in security along the new\r\npaths required by history, and we ask, and shall try to\r\nensure, always and with renewed vigour, that the path\r\nchosen is the path of solidarity, well-being, and fraternal\r\nrelations between peoples and countries.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I should like to thank the\r\nConstitutional President of the Republic of Bolivia for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bolivia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued)\r\nGENERAL DEBATE\r\nADDRESS BY MRS. KIM CAMPBELL, PRIME\r\nMINISTER OF CANADA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Canada.\r\nMrs. Kim Campbell, Prime Minister of Canada, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of Canada, The Right Honourable Kim\r\nCampbell, and inviting her to address the General Assembly.\r\nMrs. CAMPBELL (Canada): It has been an\r\nextraordinary year since the General Assembly met last year.\r\nWe have seen breakthroughs in two areas - South Africa and\r\nthe Middle East - which have bedevilled the international\r\ncommunity for decades. Bringing both to a successful\r\nconclusion will be hard, but we have good reasons for\r\noptimism. Canada applauds the courage and foresight of the\r\nparties involved, and pledges that it will continue to do its\r\npart in promoting further advances.\r\nBut, at the same time, we have also seen tragedies - in\r\nSomalia, Bosnia, Angola and elsewhere - which have, thus\r\nfar, defied our best efforts to bring peace.\r\nIt is against this background, of hope renewed and\r\nhopes dashed, that I wish to speak about the United Nations\r\ncentral vocation: the defence and promotion of peace and\r\nsecurity and the conditions in which they can thrive. It is a\r\nCanadian vocation as well.\r\nSince United Nations peace-keeping was invented in\r\n1956 by Lester Pearson, we have been there; sweating it out\r\nin the field, taking casualties, doing the tough work for\r\npeace, in partnership with a growing number of other\r\nMember States. Since 1956, Canada has fielded almost\r\n100,000 men and women in United Nations operations in\r\nevery corner of the world. That contribution has been a\r\ncostly one for us, not least in lives lost. None the less, it is\r\na contribution which has been a symbol of pride to most\r\nCanadians, a tangible expression of our national quest for a\r\nbetter world.\r\nCanadians speak from experience born of commitment.\r\nWe see the changes which must be made and the principles\r\nwhich must remain immutable. The world is hungry for\r\nmultilateral solutions to conflict and war. This is our time,\r\nthe United Nations moment. We are living through decisive\r\npolitical change. Cold war certainties have given way, but\r\nin their place we have unpredictability and instability - a\r\npolitical unease about our future, uncertainty about where\r\ncollective endeavours can take us. Most countries feel more\r\nsecure militarily, but our citizens, in their personal lives,\r\noften feel less secure about their well-being, for themselves\r\nand for generations to come.\r\nBut this broader perspective must not obscure the very\r\nreal military dangers which remain: excessive accumulations\r\nof conventional arms; the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction - chemical, biological and nuclear; and conflict\r\nand human misery created by the breakdown of civil and\r\npolitical society within States and across fragile and often\r\nnew borders.\r\nThe world has learned some hard lessons in recent\r\nyears. First, we have learned that our security is\r\ninterdependent. Within each specific area of concern -\r\nwhether military, economic, environment or health - no\r\nnation can stand alone. We are all affected, positively and\r\nnegatively, by developments beyond our borders. And our\r\nown actions, within our own countries, inevitably resonate\r\nthroughout the wider community of nations.\r\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nSecondly, we have learned that our security is\r\nindivisible. We cannot escape the connections linking\r\nissues; between, for example, economic growth,\r\nenvironmental safety and population flows. Deterioration in\r\nany one area can destabilize the whole. We must think\r\nabout security more broadly, in terms which address\r\nfundamental sources of insecurity: questions of economic\r\ndevelopment and prosperity; environmental integrity;\r\nfreedom from crime and physical threat; health; membership\r\nin communities which reflect our values, traditions and\r\naspirations.\r\nThirdly, we have learned that genuine security is not\r\nabout control and repression. It is about striking the right\r\nbalance of interests, within countries and across borders.\r\nFourthly, we have learned that we have to find more\r\ncooperative ways of addressing security issues, ways which\r\nmaximize the relative strengths of many existing institutions.\r\nWe foresee a network of collaborative arrangements - local,\r\nregional and global - forming the building-blocks of a new\r\nsystem of collective security, all hinged on the focal point of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations itself provides useful\r\nguidance, describing possible relationships between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional bodies in the pacific settlement\r\nof local disputes. Cooperation between the United Nations,\r\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European\r\nCommunity in Europe; between the United Nations, the\r\nCommonwealth and the Organization of African Unity in\r\nAfrica; and between the United Nations and the Organization\r\nof American States in Central America and Haiti has moved\r\nus considerably along the path anticipated by the drafters of\r\nthe Charter. Moreover, regional organizations are often the\r\nbest equipped to deal with local sources of instability and\r\npotential conflict, such as water disputes, demographic shifts\r\nor human rights concerns.\r\nFor decades, the cold war hemmed us in. That time is\r\nover. We have it within our grasp to fulfil the promise of\r\nour Charter, to build a global cooperative security system\r\ncentred on the United Nations. For it is the United Nations\r\nalone which can provide a universal forum for elaborating\r\nnew principles and negotiating new rules and standards.\r\nAnd it is the United Nations alone which, as a universal\r\nbody, can bring the full weight of the international\r\ncommunity to bear on specific critical issues.\r\nIn the last five years alone, the involvement of the\r\nUnited Nations in various multilateral military efforts has\r\ngrown exponentially. Five years ago there were seven such\r\noperations; today there are 16. Five years ago there were\r\n9,000 military personnel deployed with the United Nations;\r\ntoday there are nearly 80,000, more than Canada has in all\r\nof its regular armed forces. And as we look around the\r\nworld today, the prospect of even more operations has to be\r\nseen as inevitable.\r\nThe transformation in United Nations operations has not\r\nbeen simply quantitative of late. The fact is that the United\r\nNations is now engaged in a range of activities which goes\r\nwell beyond the traditional concepts of peace-keeping we\r\nhave been accustomed to in the past. Much of the\r\nSecretary-General’s ground-breaking \"An Agenda for Peace\"\r\nhas moved from prescription to reality, and rightly so. It is\r\nquite right to ask whether and under what conditions the\r\nUnited Nations should commit its resources to the resolution\r\nof international crises. It is equally right to ask whether the\r\nUnited Nations has the right tools to do what is asked of it.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe rapid expansion of United Nations operations in the\r\npast several years has been both unprecedented and\r\ninstructive. In the process we have all learned certain\r\nlessons, some in a very wrenching fashion. We would all do\r\nwell to take stock of our recent experience and determine\r\nhow we can together improve our capacity to act more\r\neffectively.\r\nHaving been an active participant in virtually every\r\nUnited Nations military operation, Canada has made its own\r\ndiagnosis and come to its own conclusions as to some\r\nremedies that should be pursued.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nTo begin with, we must improve our collective capacity\r\nto judge, to determine accurately and dispassionately the\r\nnature of impending threats and the facts of specific cases.\r\nWe must also improve our capacity to act, to respond firmly\r\nand effectively to events before they deteriorate into crises.\r\nThere are steps we can take now to improve our\r\ncollective capacity in the field of preventive diplomacy.\r\nRecent initiatives to strengthen our early-warning system\r\nshould be implemented. To do that, the Secretary-General\r\nshould be given the resources necessary for independent\r\npolitical analysis, analysis that he could draw on before\r\narmed conflict is unleashed and when non-military\r\nintervention can still be effective. Not only must warnings\r\nbe timely; they must also have an impact on decisions. The\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 7\r\nSecretary-General must make full use of the provisions of\r\nArticle 99 of the Charter to bring to the attention of the\r\nSecurity Council situations which may threaten peace. This\r\nwould itself provide a powerful stimulus to global attention\r\nand necessary preventive action.\r\nThe United Nations ability to conduct preventive\r\ndiplomacy through the good offices of the Secretary-General\r\nmust be strengthened. The Secretary-General’s efforts to\r\naddress dozens of conflicts and potential conflicts require\r\ntangible support. The preventive deployment of peace-\r\nkeepers to forestall conflict, as we have recently done in the\r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, can prove very\r\nuseful and in the long run avoid a much larger commitment\r\nof scarce resources.\r\nExperience with the assignment of United Nations\r\nmilitary forces around the world has, in our view,\r\ndemonstrated a number of shortcomings. It is incumbent on\r\nus all to move quickly to respond to them by changing the\r\nway that business is conducted. First, major operations can\r\nno longer be run on an ad hoc basis. The management,\r\nplanning and operational capacity of the United Nations has\r\nto be reinforced. A permanent strategic headquarters staff\r\ncapable of controlling two or more large-scale,\r\nmultidimensional operations has to be put in place. To be\r\neffective, this headquarters would need a comprehensive\r\ninformation processing and planning capacity.\r\nSecondly, the United Nations ability to bring matériel\r\nand personnel speedily to a theatre of operations and to\r\nensure coordination between sources of equipment and\r\npersonnel has to be strengthened. Too often in the past, the\r\nSecretary-General has had to delay United\r\nNations-sanctioned operations for want of adequate personnel\r\nor matériel.\r\nThe ability to deploy United Nations troops rapidly to\r\nemerging flashpoints has to be upgraded substantially. At a\r\nminimum, Member States should enter into formal\r\ncommitments with the Secretary-General to provide troops\r\non a stand-by basis and tied to readiness standards, as\r\nCanada has done in the past year.\r\nThirdly, United Nations Members have to build and\r\ndevelop the large cadre of peace-keepers necessary for the\r\nUnited Nations missions of the future. Peace-keeping\r\ndemands cultural sensitivity, the ability to mediate and a host\r\nof other skills. Training will be required, particularly of a\r\ncorps of senior officers who will have to exercise leadership\r\nin complex, difficult and dangerous situations. Training\r\nholds the key to successfully integrating different national\r\ncontingents into one operation.\r\nFourthly, we need to ensure that field operations meet\r\nhigh performance standards. Work on the development of\r\na common code of conduct and operating procedures for all\r\npersonnel serving under the United Nations flag should be\r\nbrought to an early conclusion.\r\nFifthly, we must also come to grips with the\r\nincreasingly serious dangers facing our peace-keepers. We\r\nand others are working to clarify and codify principles and\r\nmeasures for the protection of United Nations personnel,\r\nparticularly those involved in peace-keeping operations.\r\nCanada will be proposing specific provisions for such a\r\nconvention to be discussed during the coming General\r\nAssembly session.\r\nIn the last several years, a range of innovative proposals\r\nhas been put forward with a view to enhancing the capacity\r\nof the United Nations to mount effective multilateral military\r\noperations. Many of these suggestions have been the subject\r\nof extensive debate in Canada, as they have in many other\r\ncountries. We have, in fact, been proponents of some of\r\nthese suggestions. We fully recognize, of course, that ours\r\nis but one perspective. Actually realizing these necessitates\r\na much broader level of support by United Nations Member\r\nStates.\r\nAccordingly, in the best interests of future United\r\nNations efforts, it is time that a panel of civilian and military\r\nexperts with experience in United Nations operations be\r\ncharged with assessing these and other proposals which\r\ncould further enhance the operational capacity of the United\r\nNations. Such a report should be finalized and submitted to\r\nthe Secretary-General next summer. It should include clear\r\nrecommendations on both the merits of the proposals and, as\r\nimportantly, how they could be implemented and financed.\r\nThe report would in turn would provide us with the basis for\r\ncoming to collective decisions on whether or not to proceed\r\nwith any of these. Only in this way can we more\r\ndefinitively determine not only the potential need but the\r\nrequisite support for these proposals.\r\nThe agenda for such a review would include: the\r\nestablishment of a permanent United Nations staff college\r\nfor the training of military officers; the creation of more\r\ntraining facilities for United Nations troops; the development\r\nof a network of United Nations material supply depots\r\nstockpiled with equipment for rapid dispatch to new United\r\nNations operations; the question whether United Nations\r\nMember States would provide at nominal, if any, cost\r\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nequipment and matériel which would be made available to\r\nUnited Nations contingents not having such resources in\r\ntheir own military establishments; and the creation of a\r\npermanent rapid deployment force under United Nations\r\ncommand, based possibly on a new United Nations volunteer\r\nforce.\r\nThere may well be other issues that should be on that\r\nagenda. The key, however, is to have that assessment made.\r\nMy own Government is committed to reviewing these and\r\nother related questions in the context of a reappraisal of our\r\nown military capacity, including our participation in United\r\nNations operations.\r\nSecurity is more than simply a matter of being able to\r\ndeploy adequate numbers of troops on a timely basis.\r\nModern United Nations missions are drawing on expertise\r\nfar beyond that of traditional military peace-keepers. There\r\nis a demand for civilian police, for election workers, for\r\nhuman rights monitors, for engineers, administrators and\r\nother specialists to rebuild infrastructure. It is not enough to\r\nstop hostilities; the United Nations is now expected to build\r\nthe peace as well.\r\nWe are moving from a tradition of interposing peace-\r\nkeepers between hostile forces to new forms of engagement.\r\nRebuilding societies to stand on their own will be a complex\r\nand lengthy process. Diplomatic peacemaking, military and\r\ncivilian peace-keeping and peace-building pose new sorts of\r\nchallenges. It has become obvious, in our view, that a more\r\nintegrated and coordinated approach by the United Nations\r\nis now mandatory if we are to cope successfully with many\r\nof the crises which draw United Nations military forces. We\r\nhave had a measure of success in this regard in Cambodia,\r\nbut far less in other situations, such as Somalia. United\r\nNations military operations cannot in and of themselves\r\naddress or resolve the root causes of conflict. That is\r\nsomething that can be achieved only through a much more\r\nbroadly based effort, be it political, economic or social. In\r\neffect, we need a capacity to rebuild, over time, countries or\r\nsocieties which have suffered structural collapse.\r\nAn effective system of cooperative security, led by a\r\nreinvigorated United Nations, will cost money; but then,\r\ngenuine security always carries a price which is worth\r\npaying. Resources are limited, and we must all share the\r\nburden. This means paying United Nations bills in full and\r\non time. That is what Canada does, and we expect others to\r\ndo the same. It is difficult to overstate the damage that\r\nnon-payment and the build-up of arrears does to the United\r\nNations system, and to our collective capacity for effective\r\naction.\r\nBurden-sharing means taking part in the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations, from contributing troops for peace-keeping\r\nmissions to providing observers for election monitoring.\r\nToday, Canada is providing just under 4 per cent of all\r\nUnited Nations forces. Little less than one year ago,\r\nCanadian troops accounted for 10 per cent of all United\r\nNations forces. Those are rather remarkable figures when\r\nwe consider that Canada accounts for less than one half of\r\n1 per cent of the world’s population, and that our military\r\nestablishment represents less than 1 per cent of global\r\nmilitary expenditures. This is not to suggest that we are\r\nseeking a diminished role, one more commensurate with our\r\nrelative status in the world. It is, instead, to question\r\nwhether others are doing their fair share.\r\nBurden-sharing also means sharing political\r\nresponsibility for shaping and taking decisions, and for\r\nensuring that decisions and commitments are fulfilled. That\r\nis why we welcome the Security Council’s increasing\r\nattention to drafting clear mandates, sharply defining\r\nobjectives and setting deadlines. Clear and realistic\r\nmandates are necessary if the United Nations is to remain\r\nboth credible and effective.\r\nIn Canada as in a number of other countries,\r\ngovernments are facing difficult fiscal circumstances and\r\npublics that are demanding more effective, efficient and\r\neconomical service from government. The need for\r\nrationalization of government, for streamlining, and for an\r\nend to overlap, duplication and waste is one that my own\r\nGovernment has addressed in the last several months. Our\r\nefforts in that respect will continue. We have a\r\nresponsibility to our own taxpayers to ensure that the same\r\nstandards and objectives are applied to the international\r\ninstitutions of which we are members.\r\nInstitutions of the United Nations cannot remain\r\nimmune to the challenges, financial as well as political, of\r\nthe late twentieth century. They too must help shoulder the\r\nburden by becoming leaner, more efficient, better focused,\r\nmore responsible and more responsive. They must adapt,\r\njust as Member States are doing, to new technologies, to\r\ncontinuing fiscal restraint, to the challenge to do better with\r\nless. The structures here are not sacrosanct. No position,\r\nexpenditure or institution should be free of the scrutiny\r\nunder which we in Canada, and others elsewhere, have\r\nplaced our own State structures.\r\nWe applaud the reforms initiated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and we pledge our support for further action. We\r\nurge him to press on, and we urge all Member States to\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 9\r\nsupport his efforts. Our security, the security of generations\r\nto come, is in the balance.\r\nWe have a great deal to do. All of our efforts to\r\nreform the peacemaking and peace-keeping function of the\r\nUnited Nations will be in vain if we are not able to come to\r\nterms collectively with what must be regarded as the most\r\ndangerous current threat to international security: the\r\nubiquitous spread of weapons of mass destruction. In too\r\nmany areas of the world, the prospect of conflict involving\r\nnuclear weapons risks destabilizing already tense situations,\r\nand could lead to human disasters of unimaginable\r\nproportions. We must muster the collective resolve to put\r\nteeth into the Non-Proliferation Treaty, disciplining harshly\r\nthose who violate its provisions and giving confidence to\r\nthose who abide by its undertakings. We wholeheartedly\r\nwelcome the priority attached to this issue by President\r\nClinton, and the practical measures he proposed.\r\nOur own priorities are clear: further progress in nuclear\r\narms reduction; indefinite extension and universal adherence\r\nto the Non-Proliferation Treaty; negotiation of a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty; early progress to bring the\r\nchemical weapons Convention into force; and strengthening\r\nof the United Nations Conventional Arms Register. These\r\ndirect investments in peace and security must be\r\naccompanied by collective action on the root causes of\r\ninsecurity.\r\nWe must develop and consolidate democratic\r\ninstitutions and the rule of law. Modern history teaches us\r\nthat democracies are the least likely States to wage war, the\r\nbest guarantors of peace. The impartial rule of law\r\ndomestically is the surest way of keeping democracies\r\ndemocratic; internationally, it is the best way to resolve\r\ndisputes before they become crises.\r\nWe must protect and promote human rights. Security\r\nbegins at the level of the individual, and there can be neither\r\npeace nor security while people, singly or collectively,\r\nminorities or majorities, are unable to uphold their dignity\r\nand exercise their inherent rights. The General Assembly\r\nmust build on the progress achieved at the Vienna\r\nConference earlier this year and agree to establish by the end\r\nof this year the post of United Nations high commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights.\r\nWe must attack the poverty, deprivation and economic\r\nunderdevelopment which so often lie at the heart of\r\ninstability and insecurity. The Secretary-General should\r\ndraw up an agenda for development. It should incorporate\r\na bold rethinking of how the United Nations can best play its\r\nimportant role in the economic and social spheres, while\r\navoiding the duplication of activities best carried forward\r\nelsewhere. The Agenda could help redefine the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in promoting sustainable development in\r\nclose cooperation with other international economic and\r\nfinancial institutions. We owe no less to the children of the\r\nworld as we celebrate the third anniversary of the Summit\r\nfor Children.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nTo be lasting, economic growth has to respect the\r\nenvironment. Hence, we have to follow through on our\r\ncollective commitments at last year’s Rio Summit to protect\r\nthe environment. The social and economic costs of not\r\ndoing so are simply unacceptable, a fact that is all too real\r\nfor the thousands of Canadians dependent on the Atlantic\r\nfishery.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe brutal collapse of the fishery in the North-West Atlantic\r\nand elsewhere is compelling evidence of the need to address\r\nthat crisis urgently. The United Nations must urgently adopt\r\na legally binding international regime to conserve and\r\nmanage high-seas fish stocks.\r\nIt is clear, however, that no amount of development\r\nassistance can match the economic growth that could be\r\nachieved through a freer flow of goods, services, capital and\r\nideas among our Member States. Indeed, the single most\r\nimportant step we can take collectively towards improving\r\nthe prosperity of developing and developed economies alike\r\nwould be to reach, without any further delay, a substantial\r\noutcome to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations. These discussions have reached a pivotal\r\nstage; we must not lose this precious opportunity. My\r\nGovernment remains committed to doing its part to reach\r\nthat goal and to pursuing other opportunities for trade\r\nliberalization, such as through the North American Free\r\nTrade Agreement. We are convinced that the Agreement\r\nwill make the North American economies both more\r\ncompetitive and more open and will provide a much needed\r\nstimulus to global trade and investment.\r\nOur peace and security are not there for the taking. We\r\nmust work for them, and work hard - in our own countries,\r\nin our regions, and globally. We must renew and revitalize\r\nexisting structures and, where necessary, build anew. We\r\nhave a historic opportunity to make good on the language of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, on the thwarted promise of those\r\nearly days, to build in our own time a cooperative system of\r\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\npeace and security which respects difference but holds fast\r\nto universal principles of human dignity and freedom. Let\r\nus move forward, together, now.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Canada for\r\nthe statement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Kim Campbell, Prime Minister of Canada, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nADDRESS BY MR. JANEZ DRNOVSEK, PRIME\r\nMINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA\r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Janez Drnovsek, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Slovenia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Janez Drnovsek, and inviting him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. DRNOVSEK (Slovenia): Allow me, Sir, to offer\r\nyou, and the Republic of Guyana, sincere congratulations on\r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-eighth session. This session is taking place at a\r\nmoment of world history which everyone agrees to be\r\nexceptional, so it is particularly important that it be as\r\nsuccessful as possible. The fact that you are guiding its\r\nwork encourages me to hope that it will be so.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to express my\r\ngratitude for the contribution of the former Foreign Minister\r\nof the Republic of Bulgaria, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan\r\nGanev, as President of the Assembly at its forty-seventh\r\nsession.\r\nThe very presence of Slovenia as an independent State\r\nand a Member of the United Nations is adequate testimony\r\nto the fact that the world has fundamentally changed.\r\nTogether with a series of other countries that are either\r\nnewly founded or have disengaged themselves from the\r\nshackles of limited sovereignty - or both simultaneously -\r\nSlovenia was not, of course, only an object of those changes,\r\nbut a protagonist in them. The motive force for these\r\nchanges was the democratic aspirations of nations, their\r\ndemocratic movements and prominent individuals from all\r\nspheres of social life. Many of the basic principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, especially the principle of respect\r\nfor human rights, motivated the democratic movements in\r\ntheir struggle for political and economic change.\r\nWe should not forget that fact today as we watch the\r\nprocesses under way in the part of the world formerly\r\nknown as the East. The tragic events which we perceive as\r\nhaving resulted from those very changes should not blur the\r\nmemories of the movement for the freedom and dignity of\r\nmen and women as individuals and as members of\r\nhistorically, culturally and linguistically defined entities. The\r\ndifficulties faced by the new democracies were expected.\r\nYet they are strengthening democratic institutions and the\r\neffectiveness of democratic mechanisms. On the other hand,\r\nin another - the smaller -part of the East, there is an orgy of\r\ndestructive violence caused by inconceivable hatred.\r\nThe old terminology, transferred to the notion of\r\n\"countries of the former East\", obstructs a real understanding\r\nof current events in the part of the world to which it refers.\r\nIdeological notions should be replaced by terminology that\r\nrespects the cultural and historical characteristics of\r\nindividual regions, which in recent history all known politics\r\nand ideologies have tried to obliterate.\r\nThe former socialist countries that earlier on had\r\ndeveloped democracy movements are now experiencing\r\nsecure democratic development. On the other hand, in those\r\ncountries with totalitarian regimes that were suddenly\r\nconfronted with the end of the bipolar world and where\r\ndemocratic movements were barely incipient, the ensuing\r\nideological vacuum led to nationalism accompanied by\r\nexpansionism and grave violations of human rights and of\r\nthe rights of minorities. Former Yugoslavia, a typical multi-\r\nethnic State, a federation composed of six different\r\nterritorially defined members, experienced the consequences\r\nof these distinctions within its former borders, and for that\r\nreason could not survive.\r\nEvery region has its own particular characteristics.\r\nRespecting them would to a great extent facilitate\r\nstabilization and the prospects of peaceful development on\r\nthe basis of multilateral cooperation. It is not just for\r\nEurope in the wider sense that this is valid, although it is\r\ntrue that the processes of change are most pronounced in this\r\nregion, for better or for worse. The changes I am referring\r\nto put seriously to the test most of the principles of\r\ninternational cooperation and most of the mechanisms\r\ncreated to enhance it. The right to self-determination is a\r\ncase in point. This right, on the one hand, was denied to\r\nsome nations while on the other hand the misuse of the same\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 11\r\nprinciple for carrying out aggressive expansionism and\r\nland-grabs has been tolerated.\r\nThe role of the United Nations has greatly increased\r\nsince the end of the cold war, and the Organization is\r\nconfronted with a number of issues that have to be tackled\r\nin a new way commensurate to the new atmosphere. Now\r\nit is more or less clear to everybody that we cannot do\r\nwithout new concepts and new mechanisms within this\r\nOrganization to enable it to react in accordance with the\r\nrequirements of the time. It is of crucial importance to\r\nstrengthen human rights and democracy within countries and\r\nto reflect this equally in their interrelations.\r\nThere are great expectations that the United Nations\r\nwill face these issues and will be able to adapt itself\r\nefficiently. In order to do this the General Assembly should\r\nmake proposals in this regard. Let me mention some of the\r\nfields that these proposals could embrace.\r\nInternational law needs a further evolution of\r\nsubstantive provisions and consensual mechanisms for their\r\nimplementation. The principle of non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States should be reaffirmed, though it\r\nshould be sensibly qualified by adequate internationally\r\ndefined standards. International cooperation and the\r\ninterdependence of all States are continuously diminishing\r\nthe scope of matters which are essentially within the\r\ndomestic jurisdiction of States, while the scope of legitimate\r\ninternational action is being expanded. In this context there\r\nappears to be an opportunity for further protection of human\r\nrights, the rights of ethnic minorities and the environment.\r\nThe Conference on Human Rights which took place in\r\nVienna last June confirmed global standards of respect for\r\nand protection of human rights and recommended the\r\nestablishment of a high commissioner for human rights.\r\nSlovenia intends to submit during this session proposals for\r\nenhancing the activities of the United Nations in the field of\r\nhuman rights, strengthening the Centre for Human Rights\r\nand the establishment of a high commissioner for human\r\nrights.\r\nEconomic cooperation is of particular importance.\r\nCooperation in the framework of a series of existing\r\ninternational organizations and integrations must be seen in\r\nthe context of its extension to new members. Agreements\r\non economic cooperation between members and\r\nnon-members of trading blocs are already being concluded,\r\nalthough sometimes too slowly. In any case, it is important\r\nthat these associations should not close the door to the new\r\ndemocracies, since this could greatly impede the\r\ndevelopment of market economies in the new democracies\r\nat the very start. It is to be hoped that regional Economic\r\nCommissions, specialized agencies of the United Nations and\r\ninternational financial institutions will use their influence in\r\norder to help remove obstacles.\r\nAt the Earth Summit in Rio last year we took part in\r\nthe efforts for closer international cooperation on the\r\nenvironment. We will render all possible support to the\r\nUnited Nations to achieve the aims of the Rio Conference,\r\nincluding sustainable development, and to simultaneously\r\ndetect new problems in this field. Of course, success will\r\nelude us if there is no adequate supervision or sanctions.\r\nEuropean security since the end of the cold war has\r\nacquired different faces, and new countries have entered the\r\nEuropean scene. Some military arrangements with purported\r\ndefence aims have disbanded, and a number of countries are\r\nlooking for new arrangements to safeguard their security.\r\nThis represents an opportunity that should not be lost.\r\nEurope should be able to fill the security vacuum with\r\ndemocratic, forward-looking and adequate security\r\narrangements for all, the more so since it is the first time in\r\nhistory that security is not bound to increased defence\r\nspending. This is encouraging. On the other hand, we are\r\nfacing the danger of new outbreaks in different regions.\r\nThis situation, more than anything else, requires preventive\r\ndiplomacy, which should, by its very nature, be a matter of\r\ncoordination for the United Nations, whose views should be\r\nformed in the General Assembly and the Security Council.\r\nExisting security associations, such as the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO) the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Western European\r\nUnion (WEU) should be systematically extended, and care\r\nshould be taken to see that there is coordination between\r\nthem and decision-making institutions of the United Nations.\r\nThe agreement between the United Nations and the CSCE\r\nsigned in May this year is encouraging from this point of\r\nview. It may be useful to seriously consider creating forces\r\nfor rapid action, wherever timely action firmly authorized by\r\nthe Security Council could prevent a crisis.\r\nDuring the last two years Slovenia has radically and\r\nunilaterally restricted its own military potential. More than\r\nhalf of the military facilities of the former Yugoslav army on\r\nSlovenian territory have been committed to civilian needs.\r\nHowever, the Republic of Slovenia remains subject to the\r\narms embargo which the Security Council imposed on the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, this measure did not\r\nproduce the desired effect in other parts of the former\r\nYugoslavia; on the contrary, it has prevented the victims of\r\naggression from effectively defending themselves. It is our\r\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nview that it is high time the Security Council reconsidered\r\nthis measure and adjusted it to realities.\r\nI am sure that I am not alone in the view that all the\r\nnew dilemmas that the world is facing also require reform of\r\nthe structures and mechanisms of the United Nations. The\r\nGeneral Assembly should more fully utilize its own\r\ncompetence in this sense for dealing with situations and take\r\nsteps to settle international relations matters. The Security\r\nCouncil, in view of the new circumstances in the world and\r\nthe nature of current problems, would appear to need some\r\nmodification so as to be able to react more flexibly and\r\neffectively. It would be wise to increase its membership\r\nappropriately to make it more representative and to\r\nstrengthen its responsibility to United Nations Member States\r\nthrough the General Assembly. Further, strengthening the\r\nprofessional competence of the Secretariat could be\r\nenvisaged, thereby improving conditions for the effective\r\noperation of the Secretary-General. The current state of the\r\nworld, in which we are simultaneously confronted with\r\npossible dangerous consequences of otherwise welcome\r\nchanges and with the well-known mounting problems of\r\ndeveloping countries, of course demands increased efficiency\r\nof existing and perhaps new mechanisms. This means that\r\nit will also be impossible to avoid the question of settling the\r\nregular financing of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Pursoo (Grenada), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nIn closing I must unfortunately also touch on a matter\r\nthat has already disturbed and concerned the international\r\ncommunity for far too long: the crisis in some parts of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. Slovenia, despite being near the regions\r\nof armed conflict in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nhas not been directly involved in the problems that have\r\nbeen the cause of armed conflict for the last two years. This\r\ndoes not, of course, mean that people of Slovenia and the\r\nSlovene Government are indifferent. The Republic of\r\nSlovenia is respecting sanctions and is cooperating in all\r\nefforts by the international community to bring peace to\r\nthese countries. We have submitted proposals in order to\r\nalleviate the crisis, find a political solution and cut short the\r\nwar and suffering. Unfortunately, the war still rages on.\r\nWe are constantly reminded of this by the presence of\r\n70,000 refugees living in Slovenia. Caring for them is no\r\nsmall burden for the 2 million inhabitants of Slovenia, even\r\nthough we have the cooperation of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees. However, international aid for\r\nrefugees is decreasing.\r\nIn our view, it is crucial to abide by all the principles\r\non which the international order after the end of cold war\r\nshould be based. This would encourage the newly founded\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia to follow these principles\r\nand, like other States founded on the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia, to seek membership in the United Nations in\r\naccordance with the Charter. The political and economic\r\ninterests of all members of the former Yugoslavia can begin\r\nto be met only through negotiations, on an equal legal\r\nfooting, on the succession of the former Yugoslavia.\r\nSlovenia supports, and will continue to support, all\r\ninitiatives to create a better world that provides adequate\r\nprospects for the coming generations - a world based on the\r\nmutual interests of the entire international community,\r\nwithout the horrors of war, poverty and social distress, a\r\nworld in which human rights and the dignity of every\r\nindividual are standards respected by all Governments.\r\nI wish the General Assembly every success at the\r\ncurrent session in its work towards this goal.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Slovenia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Janez Drnovsek, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Slovenia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nMr. SATTAR (Pakistan): It is with great pleasure that\r\nI extend to the President of the General Assembly the\r\nfelicitations of the Pakistan delegation on his election to\r\npreside over the forty-eighth session. His diplomatic skills\r\nand wide experience, particularly in the United Nations, will\r\nbe a valuable asset for the success of this important session\r\nof the Assembly.\r\nWe express our appreciation and gratitude also to the\r\nprevious President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for his memorable\r\ncontribution in guiding the forty-seventh session of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nA special tribute is due to the Secretary-General of our\r\norganization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedication\r\nand dynamism. We agree with the Secretary-General that\r\npeace, development and democracy are interlinked and that\r\n\"Cooperative global integration is now an inescapable\r\nfact and requirement for all the world’s peoples.\"\r\n(A/48/1, para. 13)\r\nPakistan is happy to welcome the Czech Republic,\r\nSlovakia, Eritrea, the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 13\r\nMacedonia, the Principality of Monaco and the Principality\r\nof Andorra as Members of our Organization. We look\r\nforward to close cooperation with them in efforts to\r\naccomplish the aims of the United Nations.\r\nTo that objective, and to the noble vision of the\r\nCharter, Pakistan has been committed ever since its\r\nindependence. We have throughout sought to abide by its\r\nprinciples, and we reaffirm our faith in their timeless\r\nvalidity. As in the past, so also in the future Pakistan will\r\nextend its wholehearted cooperation to all other States in\r\ncommon efforts aimed at realizing the ideals that inspired\r\nthe establishment of the United Nations.\r\nNearly half a century later retrospection evokes mixed\r\nfeelings. The Organization’s failures and acts of omission\r\nhaunt and depress; yet Members of the United Nations have\r\nmuch to celebrate. Some of the achievements during these\r\ndecades have been monumental.\r\nOver 130 nations have emerged from the dark era of\r\ncolonialism and alien domination, each bringing its unique\r\ngenius to enrich world civilization, and to advance the cause\r\nof human dignity.\r\nThe nightmare of a nuclear Armageddon has been\r\naverted. Weapons of mass destruction are being reduced.\r\nIdeological rivalry and confrontation have yielded to peace\r\nand cooperation.\r\nDemocracy continues to triumph. People in large parts\r\nof the world have achieved economic and social progress,\r\nand better standards of living in peace and freedom.\r\nIn moments of optimism, we even perceive the glimmer\r\nof a new dawn, of a more equitable and tranquil era, when\r\npower will have been civilized, when differences and\r\ndisputes between States will be resolved, not through\r\naggression or intimidation, but by peaceful means on the\r\nbasis of law and justice, as they are between individuals.\r\nThat vision appears tantalizingly close, yet it eludes our\r\ngrasp. The world community’s progress towards peace and\r\nprosperity is both slow and meandering. We have witnessed\r\nmany setbacks and reverses. At such times the vision of\r\npeace seems to recede to the far horizon.\r\nRespect for fundamental rights has been severely\r\nundermined. Some States have exhibited blatant disregard\r\nand contempt for international norms, allowing and even\r\nencouraging their forces to perpetrate barbarous acts that\r\noutrage the conscience of decent people.\r\nInstead of civility and the practice of tolerance being\r\npromoted, chauvinism and the evils of bigotry and hatred are\r\nencouraged in some countries. The consequence has been\r\npogroms against minorities and destruction and desecration\r\nof their places of worship.\r\nThe number of people in the world who have been\r\nforced to flee their homes as refugees has risen to a record\r\nlevel, straining the resources available for their relief.\r\nThe problem of poverty has intensified. A billion\r\npeople live in penury, without adequate food and shelter.\r\nFor them, life is short and brutish.\r\nManifestly, the United Nations has a long road to\r\ntravel, and many old and new obstacles to overcome, before\r\nit fulfills the aims and purposes set for it in the Charter. But\r\neven as we count the multifarious challenges, we can draw\r\nsome solace from recent successes.\r\nA remarkable transition has taken place in Cambodia,\r\na transition in which the United Nations Transitional\r\nAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC) played a pivotal role. The\r\ncommendable contribution of the Secretary General’s Special\r\nRepresentative, Mr. Yasushi Akashi, and his collaborators,\r\nis a source of satisfaction for the Organization and its\r\nmembers. Committed to the promotion of peace and\r\nstability, Pakistan is happy to have provided 1,500 personnel\r\nfor UNTAC during the transition.\r\nThe Declaration of Principles signed by the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and Israel is a positive development.\r\nImplemented in good faith, it could go down in history as an\r\nimportant first step towards peace and coexistence in the\r\nMiddle East. Vital to the realization of that aim will be\r\nrespect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and\r\nan equitable settlement of the outstanding issues. The status\r\nof Al-Quds-el-Sharif remains a crucial issue of interest to us\r\nin Pakistan and, indeed, to Muslims all over the world.\r\nWe hope that the Declaration, evolved with the\r\ncommendable contribution of Norway, and the agenda\r\nagreed between Jordan and Israel will give a fillip to the\r\nnegotiations for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East,\r\nfor which Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\r\n338 (1973) provide an agreed and necessary basis.\r\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn Afghanistan the accommodation achieved by the\r\nmujahidin leaders, and the formation of a coalition\r\ngovernment, is reason for satisfaction. Consolidation of\r\npeace will allow the Afghan people to enjoy the fruits of\r\ntheir epic victory. Meanwhile, a programme for the\r\nreconstruction of this war-ravaged country needs to be\r\nlaunched immediately. By providing employment, it will\r\nreinforce the peace process. Pakistan is prepared to join in\r\ninternational efforts for the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\r\nAssistance is needed also for the million and a half Afghan\r\nrefugees in Pakistan who are still unable to return to their\r\nhomeland, pending the creation of conducive economic and\r\npolitical conditions.\r\nThe political evolution in South Africa holds the\r\nwelcome promise of peace and freedom for all its people.\r\nThey and the world at large applaud the valiant freedom\r\nfighter and statesman, Nelson Mandela, for his sagacious\r\nleadership. Pakistan will respond positively to his proposals\r\nto bring South Africa back into the comity of nations. The\r\nformation of a pluralist, democratic Government is in sight.\r\nPakistan looks forward to developing close and friendly\r\nrelations with the new South Africa.\r\nIn Somalia, too, notable progress has been made\r\ntowards the restoration of law and order and the\r\nrehabilitation of its polity, though, regrettably, the process\r\nhas been slow and painful. We in Pakistan are deeply\r\ngrieved because our troops have suffered heavy casualties on\r\naccount of the misguided acts of a Somali faction. Yet\r\nPakistan will not abandon the United Nations Mission. Our\r\ncontingent will continue to hold high the United Nations\r\nflag, assist relief operations and promote the re-establishment\r\nof peace and harmony in Somalia, for whose people we\r\ncherish abiding goodwill and fraternal affection.\r\nWe welcome the progress achieved in Mozambique,\r\nLiberia and Rwanda, and hope that the relevant agreements\r\nwill be implemented in letter and in spirit. The unfortunate\r\ndevelopments in Angola must be reversed. We urge the\r\nparties concerned to seek dialogue and national\r\nreconciliation. The international community must assist\r\nthese countries in restoring peace and normalcy.\r\nThe optimism generated by the end of the cold war has\r\nbeen blighted by the colossal tragedy in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. A member of the United Nations has been\r\ncarved up by the use of force and its people brutalized\r\nthrough aggression and cold-blooded genocide. Crimes\r\nagainst humanity have been perpetrated on a scale not seen\r\nsince the Holocaust. The conscience of mankind has been\r\noutraged. Yet the community of States failed to act in\r\ndefence of a small State. It has succeeded, instead, in\r\ndenying the inherent right of a State to self-defence. Indeed,\r\nsome of the members of the Security Council even\r\nobstructed moves to assist the victims of aggression and\r\nslaughter, knowing full well that the perpetrators of\r\naggression were being aided and abetted by their ethnic\r\nneighbours.\r\nWith their hands tied behind their backs, the Bosnians\r\nhave been forced to negotiate a so-called agreement. They\r\nhave been obliged to submit to a diktat in disregard of equity\r\nand even the resolutions of the Security Council. A plan\r\nthat would reward aggression and legalize acquisition of\r\nterritory by force cannot, and should not, win the\r\napprobation of the world community.\r\nThe General Assembly can still act, even at this\r\neleventh hour, to salvage the hope that has been invested by\r\nthe people of the world in the United Nations. Its voice\r\nmust rise in defence of law and justice, in order to preserve\r\nthe sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina; to ensure an\r\nequitable apportionment of territory among its different\r\nethnic components; to strengthen the United Nations force so\r\nthat it can keep and enforce the peace; to protect the safe\r\nareas to provide relief against hunger and the rigour of the\r\napproaching winter; and to punish those responsible for the\r\nbestial crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nAzerbaijan is yet another victim of aggression.\r\nArmenians have occupied Azeri territory and expelled\r\nhundreds of thousands of people from their homes. We call\r\nfor an end to this aggression and for the withdrawal of\r\nArmenian forces. Also, the Azeri refugees need the\r\nassistance of the world community for the relief of their\r\nsuffering.\r\nThe crisis in Kashmir calls for urgent action by the\r\nUnited Nations. India has unleashed a brutal reign of terror\r\nand repression in the occupied State in an unconscionable\r\nattempt to bludgeon the Kashmiri people into submission and\r\nto thwart their legitimate struggle for the realization of their\r\nright to decide their own future. This is, of course, an\r\ninherent right, but in the case of Kashmir it has been\r\nspecifically pledged to them by Pakistan, by India and by the\r\nUnited Nations. It is sanctified in the resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council pertaining to Kashmir.\r\nInternationally respected non-governmental human\r\nrights organizations have graphically documented the brutal\r\ncrimes committed by the Indian occupation forces.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 15\r\nSince 1990 Amnesty International has been reporting on\r\nthe massive violations of human rights in Kashmir by Indian\r\nforces, on the practice of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and\r\nkillings of Kashmiris in custody, and on the perpetration of\r\nrape as a matter of policy.\r\n\"Rape is not uncommon and there is evidence of its\r\nemployment as an instrument of terror\", says\r\nP. M. Vandarajan, a University of Oxford lecturer, who\r\nvisited Kashmir in September 1992. In his report,\r\npublished by the International Federation of Human\r\nRights, Paris, the author recalls:\r\n\"The infamous mass rape by the Indian Army at\r\nKunan Poshpora was reported widely in the press, both\r\nin India and abroad. It is, to date, the most sickening\r\nexample by far of the brutal excesses of the Security\r\nForces against the women of the region\".\r\nIt is the most sickening, but it is by no means a solitary\r\nincident.\r\nAlso catalogued in the report are cases of\r\n\"disappearances\" of people, and of young men who \"are\r\ntortured in Kashmir every day\", and of extra-judicial, or\r\nillegal, executions, which \"are alarmingly frequent\".\r\nThe very titles of the reports issued by international\r\nhuman rights organizations and by reputable journals depict\r\nthe grave conditions in Kashmir. Headlines and titles of\r\nreports issued during 1993 include: \"Heaven on Fire\", a\r\nreport by Tim Gopsill on behalf of the British Parliamentary\r\nGroup; \"India’s Shame\", a London Sunday newspaper, 17\r\nJanuary 1993; \"The crackdown in Kashmir - Torture of\r\nDetainees and Assaults on the Medical Community\", Asia\r\nWatch and Physicians for Human Rights; \"Extra-Judicial\r\nExecutions, Rape, Arbitrary Arrests, Disappearances and\r\nother violations of Basic Human Rights by the Indian\r\nSecurity Forces in Indian-administered Kashmir\", a report by\r\nthe International Federation of Lawyers for Human Rights;\r\n\"Violations of human rights committed by the Indian\r\nsecurity forces in Jammu and Kashmir\", by the same\r\nOrganization; \"Rape in Kashmir: A Crime of War\", by Asia\r\nWatch and Physicians for Human Rights.\r\nThe report by Asia Watch, a division of Human Rights\r\nWatch, New York and Washington, and Physicians for\r\nHuman Rights, Boston, released in June 1993, concludes:\r\n\"In their efforts to crush the militant separatist\r\nmovement in Kashmir, Indian government forces have\r\nsystematically violated international human rights and\r\nhumanitarian law. Among the worst of these violations\r\nhave been the summary executions of hundreds of\r\ndetainees in the custody of the security forces in\r\nKashmir. Such killings are carried out as a matter of\r\npolicy ...\r\n\"Methods of torture include severe beatings,\r\nelectric shock, suspension by the feet or hands,\r\nstretching the legs apart, burning with heated objects,\r\nsexual molestation and psychological deprivation and\r\nhumiliation. One common form of torture involves\r\ncrushing the leg muscles with a heavy wooden roller ...\r\nTens of thousands of Kashmiris have been killed by\r\nIndian forces in the nearly four years since India began the\r\nbrutal repression in January 1990. Many more have been\r\nmaimed and incapacitated.\r\nNo statistics can illustrate the agony of a people or\r\nportray their anguish and pain. But they do illustrate the\r\niron resolve of the people to recover their birthright. Now,\r\nin the fourth year, the Kashmiri struggle continues to gather\r\ninternal strength. It has been established beyond doubt that\r\nthe Kashmiri people have not acquiesced and will not\r\nacquiesce in Indian occupation. They have not accepted and\r\nwill not accept Indian rule.\r\nIndia’s position on the Kashmir question, and its policy\r\nin the occupied territory, constitute a fundamental defiance\r\nof international law and morality. India claims that Jammu\r\nand Kashmir is part of India; this claim is legally and\r\nhistorically baseless. The future of the State remains to be\r\ndetermined. The resolutions of the Security Council on this\r\nquestion, providing for a plebiscite to decide the accession\r\nof the State to India or Pakistan, have yet to be\r\nimplemented. A member of the United Nations cannot be\r\nallowed to refuse to implement a resolution of the Security\r\nCouncil. The resolutions in question were, moreover,\r\naccepted by Pakistan as well as India. Law does not permit\r\na party to unilaterally renounce an international agreement.\r\nThe struggle of the Kashmiri people to recover their\r\nfreedom of choice is a righteous struggle for a fundamental\r\nright. It merits the support of all members of the United\r\nNations. For Pakistan, a party to the dispute, such support\r\nis a matter of duty as well as right. The Government and\r\npeople of Pakistan remain steadfast in their adherence to the\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and in our strong support for\r\nthe Kashmiri right to self-determination. Pakistan calls upon\r\nIndia to fulfil its obligations under law. We request all other\r\nmembers of the United Nations to take appropriate action to\r\nhalt the Indian violations of human rights in Kashmir and to\r\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nensure the implementation of the Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nRecent reports testify to an alarming escalation in\r\nhuman rights abuses by the Indian forces in Kashmir. In\r\norder to investigate this human rights emergency, we\r\naddressed a letter to the President of the Security Council\r\nlast week and reiterated our suggestion that a fact-finding\r\nmission be dispatched to Jammu and Kashmir. If India has\r\nnothing to conceal, it should accept our suggestion.\r\nAlong with the resolution of conflicts, disarmament\r\noffers a real option for States, large and small, to enhance\r\ntheir security and expand the frontiers of regional and global\r\npeace. The end of the cold war has removed the threat of\r\nnuclear Armageddon. We welcome the agreements on the\r\nreduction of strategic arms. Even so, thousands of nuclear\r\nweapons will remain in the arsenals of the nuclear-weapon\r\nStates. We hope they will act to further reduce and\r\neventually eliminate all nuclear weapons. The Geneva\r\nConference on Disarmament should renew its work on a\r\nprogramme for nuclear disarmament to be achieved within\r\na specific time-frame.\r\nUntil nuclear disarmament is realized, the non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States have the right to be assured by the nuclear-\r\nweapon States that there will be no use or threat of the use\r\nof nuclear weapons. The disappearance of the rival military\r\nblocs which relied on nuclear deterrence for security against\r\neach other should make it possible for the nuclear Powers to\r\nundertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons\r\nagainst non-nuclear States.\r\nFor over 20 years Pakistan has advocated the\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. We\r\nare therefore happy that negotiations are to open in Geneva\r\nfor the conclusion of such a treaty. Pakistan will participate\r\nactively in this endeavour. We have also consistently\r\nsupported a global ban on the production of fissile material\r\nwhich should be realized on a non-discriminatory basis.\r\nThe regional approach has proved to be an effective\r\navenue to promote nuclear non-proliferation. The concept of\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones is finally being translated into\r\nreality. The Latin American nuclear-weapon-free zone came\r\ninto force this year. Mutual arrangements for\r\nnon-proliferation have also been worked out by Brazil and\r\nArgentina. The dramatic reversal in South Africa’s nuclear\r\nweapons programme has created the conditions for\r\nestablishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa. In the\r\nMiddle East, too, the progress towards peace may create\r\npolitical momentum for non-proliferation.\r\nUnfortunately, the hopes for non-proliferation in South\r\nAsia received a serious setback when India exploded a\r\nnuclear bomb in 1974. Nevertheless, Pakistan has continued\r\nto advocate efforts to eliminate the danger of proliferation in\r\nSouth Asia. To that end, we have put forward several\r\nproposals. These include a South Asia nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone; the simultaneous signature of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) by India and\r\nPakistan; mutual verification by these countries of each\r\nother’s nuclear facilities; a bilateral nuclear-test-ban treaty;\r\na conference with the participation of India, Pakistan, the\r\nUnited States, Russia and China to elaborate\r\nnon-proliferation and security arrangements in our region.\r\nRegrettably, these proposals have not yet been accepted.\r\nConventional disarmament can also be promoted most\r\neffectively in the regional context. The Geneva Conference\r\non Disarmament should elaborate principles to promote such\r\nregional arms control and disarmament in the conventional\r\nfield. The United Nations arms transfer Register has proved\r\nto be a successful experiment. Pakistan has provided the\r\nrequired information on its arms acquisition and sales.\r\nHowever, this Register may not provide a complete picture\r\nof the dangers to peace in various regions. It is only when\r\nboth the transfer and the indigenous production of\r\narmaments are taken into account that a comprehensive\r\nevaluation of arms balances or imbalances can be made.\r\nTo promote peace and prosperity, it is essential to\r\nfacilitate rather than restrain the application of modern\r\ntechnology for economic and social development. The\r\nUnited Nations should consider preparing a comprehensive\r\nstudy of the impediments placed arbitrarily in the way of the\r\napplication of advanced technology for the promotion of\r\neconomic and social development in the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe global recession of the past few years has brought\r\nsevere hardship to many of the poorest countries and\r\nespecially to the poorest within these countries. The\r\ngrowing number of people living in absolute poverty\r\nthreatens political stability in many developing countries. A\r\ncomprehensive programme for development should be\r\naccorded high priority by the world community.\r\nThe forces of protectionism must be resisted. The\r\nUruguay Round must be concluded by the end of 1993.\r\nAdequate official resources should be channelled to those\r\ndeveloping countries which are implementing far-reaching\r\neconomic reform and liberalization measures. The desperate\r\nneeds of Africa require urgent attention. A new flow of\r\nofficial assistance should be directed in particular to the\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 17\r\neradication of poverty, to human and social development\r\nprogrammes and to sustainable growth in the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe developing countries need urgently to address the\r\ninexorable and unsustainable growth in their populations.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the dedication and efforts of Mr. Nafis\r\nSadik, the indefatigable head of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund. We hope the forthcoming population\r\nConference in Cairo will devise a comprehensive long-term\r\nstrategy to meet the challenge of burgeoning populations. At\r\nthe same time, the needs of the world’s children must\r\nassume priority on national and international agendas.\r\nWith the collapse of the Iron Curtain, there are now no\r\npolitical or ideological obstacles in the way of creating a\r\ntruly global economy based on the principles of the market.\r\nWe hope that regional economic groupings will produce a\r\nmomentum towards global economic interaction and\r\nintegration, and not the reverse. Pakistan stands at the\r\ncrossroads of South Asia, Central Asia, West Asia and the\r\nGulf, and can serve as a link for mutually beneficial\r\neconomic, commercial and industrial cooperation between\r\nthese adjacent regions.\r\nThe United Nations is the only forum where the nations\r\nof the world can concert their policies to construct the new\r\nstructures for global peace and progress. The Secretary\r\nGeneral has pointed in the right direction in his report\r\nentitled \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nIt is essential to strengthen the mechanisms for\r\ndispute-settlement and the resolution of conflicts provided\r\nfor in the Charter of the United Nations. At the same time,\r\nthe Security Council must exhibit a more uniform and\r\nconsistent resolve to implement its own decisions and\r\nresolutions. Only thus can the goal of collective security\r\nbecome a living reality.\r\nPakistan agrees that an appropriate enlargement of the\r\nmembership of the Security Council is required to enhance\r\nits representative character. Its procedures should also be\r\nmade more transparent. The guiding principles for reform\r\nmust be democracy and the sovereign equality of Member\r\nStates. We cannot contemplate according privileged status\r\nto those countries which have a record of defying the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and refusing to\r\nimplement the resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nThe demands made on the United Nations for\r\npeace-keeping and peacemaking have increased significantly.\r\nToday there are 80,000 United Nations peace-keepers\r\nengaged in some 17 operations. Their missions are often\r\ndifficult and dangerous. Yet the Members of the United\r\nNations have to accept the risks and assist States and\r\ncommunities threatened by more powerful neighbours and\r\nadversaries. Pakistan is among the largest contributors to\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, with more than\r\n6,000 personnel committed to United Nations operations at\r\npresent.\r\nIf the United Nations is to discharge its growing\r\nresponsibilities, it must be assured of stable and adequate\r\nresources to finance its activities. The cost of alternatives\r\nwould be immensely higher.\r\nThe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly\r\nshould mark a watershed - a transition from the habits of the\r\ncold war to an endeavour to construct peace and universal\r\nprosperity in a new multipolar era. To succeed in this\r\nendeavour, we shall need to arrest the dangerous\r\nproliferation of national and ethnic conflicts and disputes;\r\nestablish the supremacy of human rights, democracy and\r\nfreedom; prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and move towards nuclear and conventional\r\ndisarmament, and arrest the forces of trade protectionism and\r\nmercantilism to foster global and sustainable development.\r\nThe challenges that the Member States of the United\r\nNations confront are imposing indeed. Yet, the opportunities\r\nfor genuine peace and universal prosperity are also most\r\npromising. With goodwill and cooperation, Member States\r\ncan make significant progress at this session towards the\r\nvision of peace, progress and human solidarity envisaged in\r\nthe Charter.\r\nMr. SOLANA (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe United Nations has embarked on an irreversible process\r\nof profound transformation. Efficiency and flexibility will\r\nbe the defining features of this process. But an effective\r\nUnited Nations must continue to be in the service of peace\r\nand development.\r\nThe United Nations of the next century must not be a\r\nmechanism, however efficient, for balancing the interests of\r\nthe most powerful. The Organization must move ahead as\r\nthe world’s primary instrument for promoting development\r\nand solidarity among nations and among men.\r\nOur Organization is first and foremost a body of\r\nsovereign nations. It does not and cannot have any other\r\nwill than that expressed here by Member States. The drastic\r\nincrease in the number of Members over the last four years,\r\nsomething that had not been seen since the days of\r\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ndecolonization, underscores this characteristic and is also\r\nproof of the confidence that we States place in the United\r\nNations.\r\nThis community of nations now wishes to\r\ninternationalize certain issues which in earlier times fell\r\nexclusively within the internal jurisdiction of States.\r\nMexico, as a country aware of its international\r\nresponsibilities, is acting within the requirements of the new\r\nconsensuses. But we must repeat time and again that we\r\nreject the idea of international action developing to the\r\ndetriment of national sovereignty.\r\nAll the peoples represented here must participate in\r\nforging the Organization of the future. Mexico sees in any\r\nreforms a historic opportunity to strengthen the democratic\r\nlife of this Organization.\r\nThe question of equitable representation in the Security\r\nCouncil plays a central role in the reform of our\r\nOrganization. There is a consensus on the need to increase\r\nthe number of seats in the Council. Whereas in 1945 there\r\nwere 51 Members of the United Nations, today there are 184\r\nof us. For this reason, we should perhaps try, at the very\r\nleast, to double the number of seats in the Council. But\r\nsimply increasing the membership would not be enough.\r\nThe restructuring of the Council must take into account,\r\nfirst of all, the fact that the Council lacks authority of its\r\nown. It acts by the mandate of those of us who have\r\ndecided, as sovereign States, to delegate our authority to it\r\nfor the delicate task of maintaining world peace. The\r\nquestion of the Council’s composition must be addressed\r\nhaving regard to the overriding need to guarantee the\r\nlegitimacy and transparency of the Council’s actions.\r\nThose who make the greatest contributions to the\r\nmaintenance of peace, not necessarily those who are the\r\nlargest producers and exporters of the world’s weapons,\r\nshould be members of the Council. Carrying out peace-\r\nkeeping operations is not simply a question of placing\r\nmilitary contingents at the Council’s disposition. We must\r\nrecognize the efforts of all those countries which have\r\nbrought about the peaceful settlement of international\r\ndisputes. The recent frequent recourse to the Security\r\nCouncil has tended to hide the fact that our first obligation\r\nis to resolve differences by peaceful means.\r\nA representative body must be democratic. The right\r\nof veto is not democratic, and therefore Mexico has never\r\nsupported it. Together, we must seek new ways to control\r\nthe exercise of that right and ensure that no permanent\r\nmember alone can decide or obstruct the Council’s action.\r\nTransparency in the working methods of the Council\r\nwill restore to the General Assembly the primacy derived\r\nfrom its universality and pluralism. We propose that a\r\nGeneral Assembly working group be established to make\r\nrecommendations on all aspects of the Security Council’s\r\nreform.\r\nIn recent years peace-keeping operations have increased\r\nconsiderably. This shows that the world has not yet\r\nmanaged to resolve its most pressing problems.\r\nNationalisms persist. Xenophobia and racism are on\r\nthe rise. Extreme poverty has increased.\r\nMexico sees peace-keeping operations as an excellent\r\ninstrument for containing the effects of conflict situations.\r\nSuch operations exist to create the conditions for a political\r\nsolution to be reached by peaceful means. They are an\r\nopportunity for peace, but they are not peace itself.\r\nBefore the Security Council decides to set up a peace-\r\nkeeping operation, all parties to the conflict must have given\r\ntheir consent. Only in this way can we guarantee the\r\ninviolability of the sovereign rights of States and respect for\r\ntheir internal jurisdiction.\r\nA clear mandate is also indispensable. Precisely\r\nbecause their functions have become diversified, the Blue\r\nHelmets must have clearly delimited fields of activity. My\r\nGovernment is concerned that the scope of activity of the\r\nmembers of those forces can be widened in situ, and that\r\ntheir areas of competence are confused with other collective\r\nactions based on the enforcement measures outlined in\r\nChapter VII of the Charter.\r\nIn Somalia United Nations forces should only ensure\r\nthat the international humanitarian aid reaches its intended\r\nbeneficiaries. The international community’s support for\r\npeace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief depends on\r\ntheir impartiality and transparency.\r\nMexico makes an urgent appeal to Member States\r\nimmediately to lay down parameters regulating all aspects of\r\nthe establishment and functioning of peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nNo force can replace political will in finding solutions\r\nto international conflicts. This is demonstrated by the\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 19\r\nagreement between the Palestinian Liberation Organization\r\nand the State of Israel regarding autonomy for the occupied\r\nterritories. Mexico congratulates both the parties involved,\r\nas well as those who assisted them in this great success of\r\npolitical intelligence, of concertation and respect for the\r\nrights of the other side. Weapons are yielding to the rule of\r\nreason. The self-determination of peoples and the right of\r\nevery State to live within secure and recognized boundaries -\r\nprinciples to which Mexico has always subscribed - are\r\nbeginning to gain strength in the Middle East.\r\nIn contrast to the signs of hope we are seeing in the\r\nMiddle East, the failure of the efforts to bring peace to the\r\nformer Yugoslavia is clear. Peace plans come and go, but\r\nthere has been no end to the killing and suffering of\r\ninnocent people. Mexico urges all the parties to the conflict\r\nto agree on concrete confidence-building measures which\r\nwill allow the conditions for a broad, lasting agreement to be\r\ncreated.\r\nMexico welcomes the recent decision by the United\r\nStates, France, the United Kingdom and Russia unilaterally\r\nto extend the moratorium on nuclear testing. This decision\r\nwill make it possible for the Conference on Disarmament\r\nfinally to begin negotiations to ratify a treaty completely\r\nbanning these tests. We hope that all the nuclear Powers,\r\nincluding China, will join the moratorium.\r\nThis historic decision, inspired and encouraged from the\r\nbeginning by my country, will be a vital step in preventing\r\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons. Mexico stresses the\r\npriority of the negotiations, both on their own merits and\r\nbecause of the effect they will have on the next Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty Review Conference, which will\r\ndetermine the future of this important international\r\ninstrument. For Mexico, the complete cessation of nuclear\r\ntests is inextricably linked to the fate of the non-proliferation\r\nregime.\r\nThe community of nations must now confront another\r\ndanger: drugs. Now the largest illegal business in history,\r\nthey are putting an end to human lives, corrupting the forces\r\nof order and harming political institutions, and they can even\r\naffect the stability of States.\r\nWe cannot question the merit of the United Nations\r\nConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\r\nPsychotropic Substances, an instrument which has served to\r\nguide State policies and coordinate international cooperation.\r\nCertain local and national battles have been won as a result\r\nof them. But the war has not been won, and it is now a\r\nworld war.\r\nIn view of the uncontrollable spread throughout the\r\nworld of the dirty business of drugs, of their consumption,\r\nproduction and traffic, and all the related illegal activities,\r\nwe must give thought to the ineffectiveness of the strategies\r\nwe have followed, and we must adopt a new course. We\r\nmust intensify our political determination, imagination and\r\nstrategic creativity and, above all, international cooperation\r\nin which there is respect for sovereignty and no one claims\r\npreeminence, in order to stop the growth of this terrible\r\nsocial cancer.\r\nAnother central issue of our times is the great migratory\r\ncurrents which are developing with renewed vigour as the\r\ncentury draws to a close. The great international migrations\r\nare a result of the polarization of wealth and well-being.\r\nThey are a problem which affects the entire world,\r\nexceeding the capacity for action of individual States. We\r\nneed new plans for international cooperation to seek\r\nsolutions to the most distressing problems relating to\r\neconomic underdevelopment.\r\nEvery wave of migration throughout history has its own\r\nexplanations, and the explanations are not necessarily related.\r\nHowever, they always include the search for a better life.\r\nChanges in the world’s structure are both a brake on\r\nmigration and an encouragement. In 1989, 1 per cent of the\r\nworld’s population - more than 50 million people - lived\r\noutside their country of origin. In 1992, only three years\r\nlater, this figure had doubled. At the beginning of the\r\n1990s, the number of refugees in the world had reached 17\r\nmillion.\r\nThose countries which, because of their economic\r\ndevelopment and social peace, seem to be able to accept new\r\ngroups of migrants are today undergoing internal conflicts at\r\ntimes expressed through manifestations of ethnic and\r\nreligious intolerance.\r\nDuring this period of difficult transition towards a new\r\nordering of power and balance in the world, internal\r\ntensions, protectionist tendencies, the global recession and\r\nthe disintegration of numerous States have combined to\r\nmake certain countries perceive the phenomenon of\r\nmigration as a threat to their national security.\r\nLet us keep this phenomenon from overwhelming us by\r\nadopting restrictive measures that are only superficial\r\npalliatives.\r\nMexico proposes that the Assembly begin serious\r\nthought on this subject as soon as possible.\r\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThe national plans of any State must be based on\r\npolicies which make it possible for the inhabitants to live in\r\na dignified manner in their own country. Only in this way\r\ncan we ensure that whole peoples will not try to leave in\r\nsearch of better economic opportunities. Extreme poverty\r\nhas increased in all areas of the world. For as long as the\r\nrichest one fifth of the world’s population represents 83 per\r\ncent of total income, we will have failed in our efforts at\r\neconomic cooperation.\r\nThe countries of Latin America and those of Central\r\nand Eastern Europe have made special efforts to make\r\ninternal adjustments to bring about economic reforms that\r\nwould have been hard even to imagine a few years ago. The\r\nproblem of critical poverty, however, cannot be left to the\r\nwhim of market forces. In Mexico the State has not\r\nabdicated its social responsibility. Indeed, we have\r\nstrengthened our development policies based on solidarity.\r\nPresident Carlos Salinas de Gortari has said, time and\r\ntime again, that in order to consolidate any programme of\r\nadjustment and economic stability, the promotion of social\r\nprogrammes is indispensable. He has also stressed that the\r\nexpansion, modernization and proper orientation of\r\neducational programmes was the only way, in the long term,\r\nto increase productivity and raise the living standards of the\r\npeople.\r\nThe convening of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in 1995 shows that the United Nations has\r\nacknowledged the priority nature of this item on the\r\ninternational agenda. Mexico is already participating with\r\nenthusiasm in preparations for this important event.\r\nIn the course of this year the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights was held at Vienna. The agreements reached\r\nmust lead to a strengthening of already existing legal\r\ninstruments. The community of States participating in the\r\nConference expressed their political determination to\r\nimplement these agreements in a non-selective manner, with\r\nobjectivity and respect for universality. This is a\r\nfundamental aspect of the protection and promotion of\r\nhuman rights throughout the world. Mexico would repeat\r\nbefore the Assembly that full respect for human rights\r\nrequires us to direct our efforts towards the weakest groups:\r\nthose that live in conditions of poverty, refugees, ethnic\r\nminorities, and all those people in need of respect for their\r\nway of life and their culture.\r\nMexico’s total trade with the United States of America\r\nand Canada is equivalent to 20 per cent of its gross national\r\nproduct. For this reason it signed the North American Free\r\nTrade Agreement and parallel agreements. On that basis we\r\nhope to promote, regulate and ensure trade flows, services\r\nand investments among these three countries. In due course\r\nthis will be the largest free-trade area in the world: 360\r\nmillion people with a product worth $7 trillion, a moving\r\nforce of principal importance for the world economy.\r\nBut Mexico is also a substantial and proud part of Latin\r\nAmerica. We have our cultural links and historic alliances\r\nin Latin America. We give priority to our cooperation with\r\nCentral America and with the countries of the Caribbean.\r\nWe participate actively in the Rio Group and in the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System (SELA). We, together with\r\nColombia and Venezuela, are involved in negotiations on\r\nfree trade with the Group of Three, and we hope that these\r\nwill be completed this year. With Chile we already have an\r\nagreement which has been in existence since January 1992.\r\nWe are also having talks with other countries in the area.\r\nWe participate actively in the Ibero-American\r\nConference, which is gaining the kind of standing that befits\r\nan organization of 21 Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking\r\ncountries in America and Europe.\r\nAs an Atlantic country we feel very close to Europe,\r\nwhere we have our principal partners and friends. We feel\r\nespecially close to the European Community, with which we\r\nhave a standing dialogue.\r\nWe are also a Pacific country and have significantly\r\nexpanded the number of our representatives and our trade\r\nwith Asian countries. We appreciate the support that has\r\nbeen given to us by the countries of the Asia Pacific\r\nEconomic Cooperation Council to help us to enter that body\r\nvery soon.\r\nWe have also been invited by the 24 countries of the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\n(OECD). We appreciate the invitation. We are working out\r\nthe details of our entry into this prestigious group.\r\nWe congratulate the leaders of South Africa, President\r\nDe Klerk and Nelson Mandela, on the agreements that they\r\nhave reached and we are ready immediately to initiate full\r\nrelations with that Republic.\r\nWe recognize and fully support the efforts that have\r\nbeen made in Haiti. Our Ambassador has now returned to\r\nPort au Prince. We reiterate our offer to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to give technical and economic resources for the\r\ngeneral recovery of Haiti.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 21\r\nWe wish to continue to be respectful friends of each\r\nand every one of the States that are Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe central strategy of the foreign policies of President\r\nCarlos Salinas de Gortari are diversification and the\r\ndeepening of our relations with all regions and countries of\r\nthe world.\r\nMexico has already begun preparations for the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. In my country this will not be an occasion for\r\nmeaningless celebrations and self-congratulatory gestures.\r\nWe are making a serious effort to give serious thought to the\r\nfuture of the Organization. The first question that we must\r\nanswer, however, is: What functions do we want the United\r\nNations to perform in the coming century? All the rest will\r\nfollow by accretion.\r\nIf in truth we have an opportunity - as has so often\r\nbeen said since the end of the cold war - to turn the\r\nOrganization into the cornerstone of a truly new, more just\r\ninternational order, then let us take action.\r\nMr. KOOIJMANS (Netherlands): First of all, please\r\nconvey to His Excellency, Ambassador Insanally, my\r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-\r\neighth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is being held at a\r\npoint in time in which the United Nations is being asked to\r\nplay a constructive role in many fields. The onerous task of\r\nhelping to respond to this challenge rests on his capable\r\nshoulders. I should like to wish him every success in his\r\ntask and I pledge the full support of the delegation of the\r\nKingdom of the Netherlands.\r\nThe world is balancing between great hope and\r\nimmense suffering. Walls have tumbled not only in Europe.\r\nIn the Middle East two courageous leaders, Prime Minister\r\nRabin and Chairman Arafat, have set out on the road to\r\nreconciliation between their people. In South Africa\r\nMr. Mandela and President De Klerk showed similar courage\r\nin breaking with the past and ushering in a new democratic\r\nSouth Africa. At the same time, we see violence of many\r\nkinds raking the face of the Earth. From Angola to Bosnia\r\nvillages are being destroyed and innocent people are\r\nslaughtered in cold blood.\r\nThe future of Russia as well is crucial to our hopes. A\r\ndemocratic Russia at peace with itself and its neighbours is\r\na major element of international stability. In Russia, too, we\r\nsee a courageous statesman trying to break with the past:\r\nPresident Boris Yeltsin. I join many others in expressing my\r\nfull support for his efforts to consolidate democracy in\r\nRussia.\r\nThe end of the cold war created a historic opportunity\r\nto shape a more just and peaceful world. History will judge\r\nus severely if we let this opportunity slip through our hands.\r\nStrengthening international peace and security involves\r\na broad range of efforts. It is now widely recognized that\r\n\"security\" cannot be viewed in military or political-military\r\nterms alone. A broader definition is called for. Indeed, last\r\nyear’s summit meeting of the Security Council emphasized\r\nthat non-military sources of instability in the economic,\r\nsocial, humanitarian and ecological fields can be threats to\r\npeace and security as well. The traditional distinction\r\nbetween conflicts between States and conflicts within States\r\nis also becoming blurred. Bloodshed within a State tends,\r\nsooner or later, to spill across national borders. This, of\r\ncourse, raises the issue of sovereignty. How do we define\r\nsovereignty at a time of increasing interdependence and\r\nincreasing mutual vulnerability? Sovereignty is certainly an\r\nimportant principle of international law. But this principle\r\ncan never have been intended to shield from the outside\r\nworld dictators who massacre their own people. Nor can it\r\nbe intended to allow the perpetuation of large-scale suffering\r\nand death in a State that has collapsed into anarchy. At\r\ntimes the international community can indeed have a moral\r\nduty to intervene. And at times it can be necessary for the\r\nUnited Nations to take over the de facto exercise of\r\nsovereignty in such a shattered State to allow it to be rebuilt.\r\nWe must hope that this will succeed in Somalia. We can\r\ntake heart from current developments in Cambodia, which\r\nprove that such ambitious ventures can succeed.\r\nA number of recent resolutions of the Security Council\r\nhave broken new ground by extending international\r\nresponsibility to encompass the plight of individual countries\r\nsuch as Somalia and Bosnia. Thus the definition of what\r\nconstitutes a threat to international peace and security has\r\ngradually been widened.\r\nIn his recent speech in Quebec, Secretary-General\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali discussed the issue of \"conflict\r\nsituations within nations\". He said:\r\n\"It is these new conflicts which are most\r\nthreatening to international peace today and which\r\nare most damaging to the rights of individuals\".\r\nOn that occasion the Secretary-General called for \"a\r\nnew diplomacy for democracy and human rights\". I believe\r\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthat this idea is a valuable addition to our \"Agenda for\r\nPeace\".\r\nLet me mention here the United Nations Conference on\r\nHuman Rights, which opened up new possibilities for\r\nimproving the protection of human rights. After a difficult\r\nstart, the outcome of the Conference was certainly gratifying.\r\nThe Final Document contains important recommendations\r\nfor further steps, which should now be implemented.\r\nThus, the Kingdom of the Netherlands would like to\r\nunderscore the urgent appeal of the Conference to the\r\nSecretary-General and the General Assembly to increase\r\ndrastically the funding of the United Nations Centre for\r\nHuman Rights. It is of crucial importance that in the course\r\nof this session of the General Assembly the post of high\r\ncommissioner for human rights be created, and the broad\r\noutline of the mandate established. This session will also\r\nprovide us with an opportunity to tackle one of the most\r\nheinous categories of human rights violations - that of grave\r\nwar crimes - through the establishment of the International\r\nWar Crimes Tribunal. The Kingdom of the Netherlands,\r\nwith its rich tradition in the field of international law, is\r\nproud to have been asked to host the Tribunal in The Hague.\r\nThe increasing responsibilities that the United Nations\r\nis called upon to shoulder emphasize the twin requirements\r\nof legitimacy and effectiveness. This brings us to the heart\r\nof the debate on enlargement of the Security Council.\r\nClearly, we must be careful not to jeopardize the\r\ndecision-making ability of the Security Council by making\r\nit unwieldy. However, I would favor extension of the\r\nCouncil by the inclusion of a few major countries, provided\r\nthat they were willing and able to carry the share of\r\ncollective responsibility that went with their membership.\r\nThe \"Agenda for Peace\" invites us to take a broader\r\nview of the task of maintaining peace and security. It\r\nrightly stresses the need for early warning and early action\r\nwith regard to a crisis; or - even better - preventive action.\r\nDevelopments in the former Yugoslavia and in other trouble\r\nspots of the world have once again confirmed that the longer\r\na crisis is allowed to fester, the more difficult it is to bring\r\nit under control, and the higher the cost of such action.\r\nI believe that, in this light, we should try to rethink the\r\ninterrelationship of the various instruments of crisis\r\nmanagement. Diplomatic efforts, economic sanctions and\r\nmilitary pressure should not necessarily be viewed as\r\nsequential but, rather, as an integrated set of instruments.\r\nPeacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building\r\nrequire the full range of United Nations instruments,\r\nincluding those of the humanitarian and socio-economic\r\nsectors.\r\nThe enormous increase in the number and scope of\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations confronts us all\r\nwith a daunting task. Moreover, in many cases the\r\nenvironment in which these operations take place has\r\nchanged: whereas, previously, peace-keeping operations\r\ntended to be conducted in a benign environment, where all\r\nparties benefited from the implementation of a limited\r\nmandate, now peace-keepers often operate in a hostile\r\nclimate, where one or more parties frown upon the United\r\nNations presence and the Organization’s mandate. This\r\nmeans that many operations these days are fraught literally\r\nwith physical danger for United Nations personnel - civilian\r\nas well as military - and that privileges and immunities are\r\noften violated. No longer does the blue flag automatically\r\ncommand respect, and this directly affects the credibility of\r\nthe United Nations. Consequently, mandates now tend to be\r\nstronger than before, and often they are explicitly based\r\nupon Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nThe changing character of peace-keeping operations\r\nrequires personnel with different qualifications. Well-trained\r\nsoldiers used to be able to do the job; today we require also\r\nspecialized units in the field of logistics, staff officers with\r\nexperience in multinational operations, mine-clearing experts,\r\nand so on. On the civilian side, police officers, electoral\r\nexperts, administrators and human-rights specialists are\r\nindispensable for integrated operations.\r\nIncreasing recourse to the United Nations, particularly\r\nwhen it comes to initiating peace operations, is pushing the\r\nUnited Nations to the limits of its organizational and\r\nfinancial resources. This means that in the future the United\r\nNations will have to rely more on regional organizations and\r\nstructures to carry out peace operations and other missions.\r\nThe Charter makes provision for this, and the\r\nSecretary-General has advanced a similar proposal in his\r\n\"Agenda for Peace\". On one hand, this will relieve the\r\nUnited Nations of some of its commitments; on the other, it\r\nwill enable regional organizations or structures with greater\r\nfirst-hand knowledge of the conflicts in their parts of the\r\nworld to contribute more effectively to resolution of the\r\nunderlying problems.\r\nThere are no standard formulas which dictate how these\r\ninterlocking institutions should interact, and each case will\r\nhave to be looked at individually to determine which form\r\nof cooperation is most suitable.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 23\r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands has consistently\r\nendeavoured to make a high-grade contribution to effective\r\npeace operations, to which we feel committed as a Member\r\nof the United Nations. The present reorganization of the\r\nNetherlands armed forces is specifically geared to enabling\r\nour country to participate even more broadly, speedily and\r\neffectively in future peace-keeping operations.\r\nThe Netherlands believes that adequate preparation and\r\nefficient supervision are crucial to the success of peace\r\noperations and has accordingly made a number of military\r\nofficials available to the United Nations.\r\nAs peace operations increase in number and scope, so\r\ndoes the need for support from the Secretariat. The\r\nSecretariat should be able to expand - and to contract - in\r\nproportion to the need for peace-keeping tasks. Whenever\r\nexpansion is required it should take place at an early stage.\r\nThe preparation, planning and budgeting that precede the\r\nactual operation are precisely the elements that are essential\r\nto its success. The budgets currently proposed to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for setting up new peace operations are\r\ninadequate. This not only makes it difficult for the Member\r\nStates to reach decisions on the funding of operations, but\r\nalso indicates that, at the time the budgets are presented,\r\nthere is no complete picture of the way the operation is to be\r\nset up. Obviously, if the number of peace operations\r\ndecreases, the additional staff at the Secretariat will also no\r\nlonger be necessary. What I am suggesting here is that any\r\nreinforcement be temporary, flexible and prompt.\r\nApart from proper planning and training, adequate\r\nstaffing and a satisfactory level of supervision - all of which\r\nare indispensable to the success of a peace operation - it is\r\nimportant that United Nations peace forces be on the spot as\r\nsoon as possible after the decision to deploy them has been\r\nmade. Otherwise, there is a danger that hostilities will be\r\nresumed and thus that the basis for successful\r\nimplementation of the Security Council mandate will have\r\ndisappeared before the forces are in position. Speed is\r\ntherefore of the essence if the use of greater force is to be\r\navoided.\r\nThis is possible only if there is a clear picture of the\r\nforces that can be made available to the United Nations at\r\nshort notice. In this connection, the Netherlands welcomes\r\nthe formation of the stand-by forces planning team, which is\r\nengaged in formulating a concept and drawing up an\r\ninventory of rapid deployment forces. The Netherlands has\r\nundertaken to communicate by the end of 1993 which Dutch\r\nunits could be eligible for designation as stand-by forces.\r\nThe final decision concerning possible deployment of troops\r\nwill of course always rest with the Netherlands Government.\r\nThe growing demands on the United Nations system\r\ncan be met only if standards of management, administration\r\nand accountability are high. The responsibility for\r\ndetermining and maintaining these standards lies first and\r\nforemost with ourselves as Member States. It is our\r\nresponsibility to indicate clear priorities, to ensure\r\nconsistency in the decisions taken by different United\r\nNations commissions and governing bodies, and to provide\r\nthe financial resources required to meet agreed priorities.\r\nMuch criticism levelled against the Organization\r\nindicates a genuine need to improve the functioning and\r\nmanagement of the Secretariat. Part of this criticism has its\r\nroots in the way Member States discharge their\r\nresponsibilities: the failure of Governments to set priorities,\r\nthe adoption of resolutions with unclear objectives and the\r\nfailure to pay assessed contributions cannot be blamed on\r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nI am convinced that the vast majority of United Nations\r\nstaff members are dedicated and loyal international civil\r\nservants. We owe them our respect. In areas ranging from\r\nthe direct provision of health care to non-proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons, many of them work under difficult\r\nconditions, some even risking their lives.\r\nBut despite the quality and commitment of its staff, the\r\nSecretariat should take a long hard look at its own\r\nmanagement structure. Key phrases such as management by\r\nobjectives, transparency and accountability must become\r\nhousehold words in United Nations vocabulary. Line\r\nmanagers must be given greater responsibility and should be\r\nheld accountable for the attainment of predetermined\r\nobjectives.\r\nMoreover, the Secretariat should respond to criticism in\r\na more satisfactory manner: first of all, by ensuring that\r\njustified criticism is acted upon and that corrective measures\r\nare taken without delay; and, secondly, by promptly refuting\r\nfalse allegations. In short, the public relations of the United\r\nNations need improvement.\r\nThe Secretary-General has taken several commendable\r\ninitiatives to restructure the Secretariat. The first changes\r\nwere introduced in the political sectors, and this year the\r\nsocial and economic sectors were reorganized. This\r\nrestructuring has provided a solid basis for improving\r\neffectiveness and coordination. But further measures are\r\nrequired. It is important to maintain the momentum and to\r\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nprovide clear perspectives for United Nations staff members:\r\nthey should not be kept in the dark about their future status\r\nand about the direction of reform. Lingering uncertainty has\r\naffected staff morale and thus staff effectiveness.\r\nI have already said that Member States have a\r\nresponsibility to provide financial resources for agreed\r\npriorities and mandated activities. The United Nations\r\ncannot be run on a shoestring. Year after year the\r\nOrganization suffers from long delays in the receipt of\r\nassessed contributions. As a result, mandated activities can\r\nbe implemented only in part or after substantial delay. In\r\nthe area of peace-keeping, troop contributors unfortunately\r\nhave to be prepared and able to provide long-term advance\r\nfinancing for peace-keeping operations.\r\nThis lack of discipline among Member States forces the\r\nSecretariat to spend a great deal of energy attempting to\r\nsolve incessant liquidity problems. The painful paradox is\r\nthat the Secretariat’s relative success at shoestring budgeting\r\nseems to contribute to a further deterioration in payment\r\ndiscipline among Member States. Moreover, the burden of\r\nkeeping the United Nations in business now lies unfairly\r\nwith those Member States who make their payments\r\npromptly and in full.\r\nA number of Member States appear to make partial\r\npayments as an expression of their dissatisfaction with\r\ncertain aspects of the Organization’s work. The United\r\nNations does not serve an à la carte menu: dissatisfaction\r\nshould be voiced in debate and by force of argument, not by\r\nwithholding assessed contributions.\r\nWe shall be considering the recommendations of the\r\nVolcker-Ogata report on the financing of the United Nations\r\nsystem during this session. The merits of many of the\r\nrecommendations are obvious, but generally speaking they\r\ncan only help to alleviate the immediate problems; they do\r\nnot go to the heart of the matter. Ultimately, the only\r\nsolution to the Organization’s financial problems - and this\r\ncannot be stated often enough - is prompt and full payment\r\nof assessed contributions by all Member States.\r\nWhile we insist that Member States meet their financial\r\nobligations, we also expect the Secretariat to use its financial\r\nresources in an efficient and effective manner. Some\r\nMember States have suggested the establishment of new\r\nfinancial control mechanisms. These proposals may have\r\nmerits, but we should not lose sight of the fact that a number\r\nof control mechanisms already exist. I believe that a critical\r\nreview of the functioning of the present mechanisms is in\r\norder before we decide upon new structures.\r\nBut auditing alone is insufficient. The structure of the\r\nOrganization must be such that financial and administrative\r\nmismanagement is prevented. Line managers, for example,\r\nmust be held accountable for budgets under their control. In\r\nrecent years the Netherlands delegation has presented several\r\nideas aimed at the improvement of the management of\r\nUnited Nations programmes, and these have subsequently\r\nbeen adopted by the General Assembly.\r\nIn addition, I advocate greater cost-awareness, not only\r\namong United Nations staff but also, and especially, among\r\nMember States. It is relatively simple to request the\r\nSecretary-General to undertake new activities, call additional\r\nmeetings or produce reports on a variety of issues. But we\r\nmust ask ourselves each time whether these requests meet a\r\nreal need, as they compete for strained financial and staff\r\nresources.\r\nAlthough the resources of the United Nations are\r\nlimited, genuine priorities must be met. In this respect, at\r\nthis session the General Assembly will face a particularly\r\ndifficult task. It will have to determine which activities will\r\nreceive priority under the regular budget for 1994 and 1995.\r\nAs new priorities emerge, a number of activities will have to\r\nbe reduced or even eliminated altogether. We have to live\r\nwithin our means. The Netherlands believes that additional\r\nresources are needed most to strengthen the capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations in the area of human rights, to improve the\r\nSecretariat’s capacity to plan and manage peace-keeping\r\nactivities and to ensure the effective coordination of\r\nhumanitarian and emergency operations.\r\nSo far I have addressed a number of conditions that\r\nwill have to be fulfilled if the United Nations is to respond\r\neffectively to the new challenges confronting it. A sound\r\nfinancial basis, effective management and the availability of\r\nqualified personnel, both at the Secretariat and in the context\r\nof peace operations in the field, are the material\r\nrequirements which must be met. However, no less crucial\r\nis the determination actually to implement the resolutions\r\nadopted by the Security Council. Decision-making in the\r\nCouncil should reflect the combined political will of its\r\nmembers - acting on behalf of the United Nations Member\r\nStates - actually to translate their words into action where\r\nnecessary, once the material conditions have been fulfilled.\r\nToo often in the recent past, there has been a failure to take\r\ndecisive action despite a declared willingness to do so when\r\nsuch action was both necessary and justified.\r\nIrrespective of the detrimental effect this can have on\r\npeace operations themselves, it can also cause irreparable\r\ndamage in the long term to the standing and credibility of\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 25\r\nthe United Nations as a whole. Let me be clear about this:\r\nI am not advocating resort to military action at the drop of\r\na hat. But if the Security Council draws a line and says that\r\nif the line is crossed military action will be taken, it must be\r\nprepared to fulfil this pledge. If such a course proves\r\nimpossible, then the mandate was not adequately tailored to\r\nthe situation. If, on the other hand, the mandate is adequate\r\nbut the Council lacks the will to carry it out, its apparent\r\ndetermination is nothing but an empty threat. Either way,\r\nthe credibility of the Organization is dealt a severe blow. If\r\nthis occurs too often, we run the risk that the new decisive\r\nUnited Nations of the post-cold-war era will become a paper\r\ntiger, making decisions that it cannot or will not put into\r\npractice. This must not be allowed to happen.\r\nNow, more than ever, we need a decisive United\r\nNations and a firm commitment on the part of the Member\r\nStates. The United Nations needs Member States that pay\r\ntheir dues, provide the Organization with the necessary\r\nhuman resources and have the political will to carry out the\r\ndecisions which they have collectively arrived at. The\r\nMember States need a United Nations which is able to\r\nperform those tasks, which operates efficiently and\r\neffectively and which can be made accountable for the\r\nresources entrusted to it. It is the wish of the Kingdom of\r\nthe Netherlands that this forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly will bring us closer to achieving these aims.\r\nMr. KRAVCHANKA (Belarus) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): I wish sincerely to congratulate the representative\r\nof Guyana on his unanimous election to the distinguished\r\npost of President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession. This is an expression of great respect for him and\r\nhis country. I cannot fail to note the enormous amount of\r\nhard and complicated work, deserving of the highest\r\nappreciation, that Mr. Stoyan Ganev, a representative of the\r\nfriendly, fraternal Bulgarian people, carried out in that post.\r\nWe welcome and congratulate the Czech Republic,\r\nSlovakia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,\r\nMonaco, Andorra and Eritrea, which have this year become\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nThe end of the twentieth century will undoubtedly go\r\ndown in history as a time of tectonic shifts in international\r\nrelations. With our own eyes we have seen the huge\r\ntectonic plate of the cold war, with its intense confrontation\r\nbetween two super-Powers and two ideologies, sink into the\r\npast. Living space for a new world order has been opened\r\nup. What will it look like?\r\nThe end of the last century was filled with dire\r\nforebodings reflected in a surrealistic quest, and those\r\nforebodings have, unfortunately, been borne out. The\r\ndifficult twentieth century has become the century of\r\nconfusion for the human soul and human society, and of the\r\nextreme tension of antagonisms that have many times\r\nbrought civilization to the brink of destruction.\r\nToday feelings and expectations are different. At the\r\nend of the century, it would seem, the foundation is being\r\nlaid for harmonizing new ways of life in the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nBut the establishment of a new world order is not as\r\npainless as one might imagine. Changes in the balance of\r\npower and the dynamism of international relations often\r\nmutate unforeseeably into chaotic scenes of tense\r\ncontradiction and conflict. World Powers, alliances of States\r\nand newly emerged countries are searching for their identity\r\nand rethinking their role in an entirely new world.\r\nNot always can an organizing vector or a system of\r\nvalues, guidelines and ideas inspiring all of us be felt in this\r\nworld.\r\nIn this situation, there is a new perception of the\r\npotential role of the United Nations. I believe that this\r\norganizing role of the United Nations is more lofty, more\r\nsignificant and more realistic than the one formerly assigned\r\nto it in the post-war decades, which in fact was unfeasible in\r\nthe context of confrontation between the super-Powers. It is\r\nprecisely this role for the United Nations in a new world that\r\nthe Republic of Belarus advocates most actively.\r\nIt is at this precise moment that the potential of both\r\nthe United Nations Charter and the Organization itself as a\r\ncentre for harmonizing and coordinating the action of nations\r\nis being realized. The United Nations, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has emphasized is truly\r\nbecoming irreplaceable.\r\nUndoubtedly, the new role of the United Nations\r\nrequires a new level of efficiency in the Organization,\r\nparticularly in its main bodies - the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The Republic of Belarus supports the\r\nreforms aimed at helping the Organization adapt to the\r\nfundamentally new realities and making the procedures of its\r\nmain bodies more democratic. But in surging forward, one\r\nshould not lose contact with the ground under one’s feet.\r\nReforms, responsibilities and the future are those reference\r\npoints on which we believe we should constantly focus our\r\nattention.\r\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nAt this decisive moment, the Security Council is\r\nbecoming the centre of attention, like a magic crystal ball in\r\nwhich one can discern the future. Naturally, reforming the\r\nCouncil, including expanding its membership, requires an\r\nespecially responsible approach. Mindful that in these new\r\nconditions, this most important United Nations body cannot\r\nremain the same as it was designed and created almost half\r\na century ago, we support a careful search for consensus on\r\nall issues related to its reform. Changes in the Security\r\nCouncil - especially today, when its work has become much\r\nmore intensive - should not hamper the productiveness of its\r\nefforts. To a large extent these efforts depend, in our view,\r\non well-coordinated activities among all of the Council’s 15\r\nmembers, on their adherence to the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter of the Organization and on their highly\r\nconscientious, responsible attitude, proved, through real\r\ndeeds, to the entire international community.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus, as representatives know, is\r\none of the candidates for a non-permanent seat on the\r\nSecurity Council for 1994 to 1995. Today, on the eve of the\r\ngolden jubilee of the United Nations, the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof its creation, it is appropriate to recall that at the time of\r\nthe inception of the World Parliament back in 1945, Belarus\r\nwas a founding member of the United Nations, having been\r\namong the first to sign its Charter.\r\nIt is appropriate to recall here that we have gained a\r\ncertain amount of experience through working in the\r\nSecurity Council from 1974 to 1975. It is also true that we\r\nhave been represented in that important body the fewest\r\nnumber of times compared to our friends and colleagues in\r\nthe regional group, but we hope that this injustice will be\r\nredressed at the forthcoming elections.\r\nThe new historical conditions which led to the creation\r\nof the Commonwealth of Independent States, with Minsk as\r\nthe host city for its coordinating organs, have made us take\r\na fresh look at our role and at our possibilities of\r\nparticipating in the life of the international community. This\r\nis also attested to by the joint support of the Commonwealth\r\nand of a number of friendly States for Belarus’s candidature\r\nfor non-permanent membership in the Security Council. For\r\nus, the submission of the candidature of the Republic of\r\nBelarus for membership in the Security Council does not\r\nrepresent merely a spontaneous political gesture nor a\r\nhankering for pro-forma prestige. Historical circumstances\r\nare such that the experience and the potential of Belarus, at\r\nthis very difficult moment in the formation of a new world\r\norder, can be of great importance to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nLet us take a look at this experience and potential in\r\nthose areas which have become very important for\r\npreserving global peace and security, as is widely recognized\r\nand attested to even by this current debate.\r\nI deal first with the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. As representatives are aware, Belarus is one of\r\nthe four States that inherited strategic nuclear potential from\r\nthe former Soviet Union. In our case, this is an important\r\nmodern arsenal located in the heart of the European\r\ncontinent on mobile strategic missiles. It directly affects\r\nglobal security, the nuclear balance and nuclear non-\r\nproliferation. Belarus, however, renounces the prestige of a\r\nnuclear State, the sword of Damocles referred to here by\r\nPresident Clinton, and has chosen non-nuclear status.\r\nHaving made the appropriate commitments, we are\r\nfulfilling them in practice. In 1992 we were the first to\r\nremove tactical nuclear weapons from our territory; in fact,\r\nthat was done ahead of schedule. Last February, the\r\nParliament of Belarus virtually unanimously ratified the\r\nStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) and the Lisbon\r\nProtocol to that Treaty, and also took the decision to accede,\r\nas a non-nuclear State, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons. In July of this year the instruments of\r\naccession were deposited in Washington, Moscow and\r\nLondon.\r\nI wish to emphasize that since May 1992 - that is, since\r\nthe signing of the Lisbon Protocol - we have never given\r\nany grounds for anyone to doubt the honesty, logic and\r\nconsistency of our actions. Of all the States which are the\r\nnuclear heirs to the Soviet Union, Belarus was the first, and\r\nstill the only one, to have rejected nuclear weapons in\r\npractice. Moreover, it did so without any preconditions or\r\nreservations. Thus, for the first time in the history of the\r\ninternational community, a sovereign State has voluntarily\r\nrenounced a real opportunity to possess and develop nuclear\r\npotential. This is truly a large-scale contribution by Belarus\r\nto global security and the non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons. I wish to emphasize once again that our words\r\nand deeds are not at variance.\r\nHaving put forward from this lofty rostrum in 1990 the\r\nidea of creating a non-nuclear belt from the Baltic to the\r\nBlack Sea, we have, to the best of our abilities, been\r\ntransforming our territory into part of such a belt. We hope\r\nthat in due course our idea will be supported and developed\r\nby our neighbours.\r\nOf great concern to the international community is the\r\nthreat of illegal exports from the territory of the former\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 27\r\nSoviet Union of nuclear materials, technology and\r\nequipment, which can fall into irresponsible hands.\r\nResponding to this danger, Belarus was the first State of the\r\nregion to enter into a large-scale agreement with the United\r\nStates to set up a stringent system for export control. Work\r\non implementing this agreement is already under way.\r\nOther initiatives put forward by my country are no less\r\nfamiliar to the United Nations. After many years of effort\r\nby Belarus, there has been agreement on international\r\nmachinery that has the potential to prevent States from\r\nreplenishing their arsenals with new types of weapons of\r\nmass destruction. During this session we intend to continue\r\nour active work in this area.\r\nTaking an authoritative position on these issues,\r\nBelarus, on behalf of and on the instructions of the States of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States, intends during\r\nthis session to present a joint declaration by the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States on issues of the\r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their\r\ndelivery systems.\r\nI turn now to reductions in conventional weapons. Our\r\ncountry does not manufacture battle tanks, and never has.\r\nYet we now have more tanks per capita than any other\r\nEuropean State - another part of the difficult heritage of the\r\nformer Soviet Union. When we decided to accede to the\r\nTreaty on Conventional Forces in Europe, we knew full well\r\nthat Belarus would have to eliminate 1.7 times more tanks\r\nthan the United States, 10 times more than the United\r\nKingdom and 50 times more than France. That\r\ndisproportionate burden is not taken into consideration in the\r\nTreaty, since the Republics of the former Soviet Union had\r\nno opportunity to participate in its preparation.\r\nAt stake, however, was the fate of a highly important\r\ninternational agreement on which many European countries\r\nhad been working for more than 20 years, and so as not to\r\ntorpedo all that work and set Europe back many years we\r\nundertook that excessive burden, at great cost to ourselves.\r\nNow, Belarus is making an enormous contribution to\r\nstrengthening regional and international security by\r\ndestroying the weapons of what was the most powerful\r\nmilitary tank district in the former Soviet Union. We are\r\ndoing this with extreme difficulty, because of the problems\r\nof the present transitional period. I would note that this\r\noften results in a lack of understanding among our own\r\npeople: during an energy crisis, we are destroying tanks\r\nwhile we lack the energy resources to carry out our crop-\r\nsowing campaign.\r\nWeapons are immoral, just as the Moloch of war is\r\nimmoral. But the process of disarmament has turned out to\r\nbe far from idyllic: a catch-phrase of our century - \"Guns\r\nbefore butter\" - has been fulfilled in a most unexpected way,\r\nfor the destruction of the guns has done nothing to increase\r\nthe supply of butter.\r\nIn reducing its conventional weapons, Belarus is guided\r\nby the interests of all, and is entitled to expect reciprocity\r\nfrom other States in overcoming its difficulties.\r\nOn the whole, the heritage of the former Soviet Union\r\nhas been a difficult one: an economy among the most\r\nhighly militarized, and large military contingents. Suffice it\r\nto say that at the start of 1992 there were three times as\r\nmany soldiers and officers per thousand civilians on our\r\nterritory as there were on average in the USSR.\r\nWorking sincerely to keep Belarus neutral, our\r\nParliament and our Government have adopted a policy\r\nintended to demilitarize the national economy, including a\r\n50 per cent reduction in our army over five years and the\r\ndevelopment and adoption of a defensive military doctrine.\r\nHaving lived over the centuries through the horror of\r\nnumerous wars, and having lost in their flames millions upon\r\nmillions of its citizens, the Republic of Belarus will do its\r\nutmost to ensure that the firestorm of military confrontation\r\nwill never again consume its territory.\r\nI shall deal now with ethnic conflicts.\r\nAcute and bloody ethnic, religious and intercommunal\r\nclashes have become a dangerous feature of the new world.\r\nThe deep, often irrational, roots of these conflicts pose an\r\nespecially difficult challenge to the entire international\r\ncommunity, for they do not respond to simple prescriptions\r\nfor settlement. In Belarus, profound social transformations\r\nare taking place against a background of unique mutual\r\ntolerance among varied ethnic, cultural and religious groups\r\nwithin our society. Not a single drop of blood has stained\r\nthe soil of Belarus during this difficult time of transition.\r\nWe shall continue to do our best so that Belarus, nestled in\r\nthe very heart of the European continent, can continue to set\r\nan example of political, ethnic and religious balance.\r\nMr. Nyakyi (United Republic of Tanzania), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nBelarus is unique in its humanistic spirit, which can\r\nguarantee stability and irreversible democratic reform, and\r\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nwe sincerely offer to the Security Council our experience of\r\ncoexistence among different ethnic groups and the centuries-\r\nold tradition of national, cultural and religious tolerance that\r\nis a feature of our country.\r\nI am sure that tolerance can be an important key to the\r\nresolution of any conflict. With international effort, we can\r\nsucceed. It was tolerance in the highest sense of the word\r\nthat made possible a recent handshake, which finally opened\r\nthe way to what had seemed the impossible: a Middle East\r\nsettlement. It is tolerance that will determine the success of\r\nthe process under way in South Africa, and it is a lack of\r\ntolerance that is delaying the settlement of the crisis in\r\nBosnia.\r\nInstability; ethnic and religious clashes; ethnic and\r\nregional separatism; internal political strife: they have all\r\nreached tragic levels in the post-Soviet areas. In a number\r\nof cases, they have grown into local military conflicts, and\r\neven wars. The internal stability of Belarus and its position\r\nat the centre - serving as host to the coordinating bodies of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States - give Belarus the\r\npotential to be a peacemaking mediator in such conflicts.\r\nFor example, we sincerely wish to help settle the\r\nproblem of Nagorny-Karabakh. Belarus remains ready to\r\nassist in convening the international conference on Nagorny-\r\nKarabakh, under the auspices of the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), to be held in our\r\ncapital, Minsk, on a date to be determined by the\r\nparticipants.\r\nWe believe that the neutrality proclaimed by Belarus is\r\nan international asset. This constitutional objective enables\r\nus to adopt a wider, unbiased approach to determining our\r\npositions on various issues. We do this taking due account\r\nof the realities of today’s world and of our place in that\r\nworld. We strive to pursue our policies in such a way as to\r\nlay the foundation for a prosperous and neutral Belarus.\r\nSpecifically, we are moving towards the development and\r\nimplementation of the principles of democracy.\r\nThe Belarus Parliament is in the final stages of\r\nconsidering our new Constitution, which will consolidate the\r\nirreversibility of the democratization of our State. We are\r\nbuilding a new political structure: new political parties,\r\nnational, social and political movements, and hundreds of\r\ncivic organizations have been officially registered and have\r\nbegun their political activities.\r\nAmong these organizations is the League for the\r\nProtection of Human Rights. The evolving human-rights\r\nstatus of Belarus is up to international standards. As early\r\nas 1991 we ratified the Optional Protocol to the International\r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and recognized the\r\ncompetence of the Human Rights Committee, in keeping\r\nwith article 41 of the Covenant.\r\nBelarus commends the results of the second World\r\nConference on Human Rights, held this year in Vienna. The\r\nConference in particular reiterated the obligations of States\r\nto ensure completely and effectively all human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms without any discrimination whatever\r\nagainst persons belonging to national minorities. We attach\r\ngreat importance to this provision.\r\nBelarus has created and is still creating all the\r\nnecessary conditions for national minorities that live in its\r\nterritory so that they can fully enjoy human rights. But at\r\nthe same time we are far from being indifferent to the\r\ntreatment of Belarusians who live beyond our national\r\nterritory and will continue in future to follow closely the\r\nsituation of more than 2 million ethnic Belarusians who live\r\nin different countries of the world.\r\nEconomic reforms are gaining ground in the Republic.\r\nA gradual movement towards a market economy has\r\nincreased the level of openness of the economy and has\r\nlimited the State’s monopoly in a number of areas of life.\r\nConcrete steps towards creating a private sector have been\r\ntaken. The law on private landed property, which is of\r\nfundamental importance in this respect, has been in force\r\nsince 1 September. The adoption of these legislative acts,\r\nlike the laws on property, entrepreneurship, and foreign\r\ninvestment, has created the basis for the further development\r\nof market relations. Right now Belarus is on the threshold\r\nof a wider stage of its privatization.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus, like other States of this\r\nregion, is vitally concerned about developing and\r\nstrengthening multilateral cooperation in the economic field.\r\nWe believe that there are forms of discrimination and\r\nlimitation with respect to the States of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope which should, along with the cold war, become a\r\nthing of the past. Any delay here will be at variance with\r\nthe political and economic realities of the world.\r\nBelarus is striving to lift barriers and limitations in the\r\nfield of trade and has taken a decision to start negotiations\r\non its accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and\r\nTrade (GATT). We also hope that very soon the Uruguay\r\nRound will be successfully completed.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 29\r\nIntegration on a new level of economic activity within\r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is especially\r\nurgent for us. Belarus was one of the main initiators for\r\nsetting up an economic union within the framework of the\r\nCIS and of concluding an appropriate agreement to that\r\neffect. It is with great pleasure that I state that an agreement\r\non setting up such an economic union was signed recently,\r\nunder the chairmanship of Mr. Shushkevich, in Moscow at\r\nthe meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the CIS.\r\nThis opens up favourable prospects for the economic\r\nstabilization of the Commonwealth of Independent States and\r\nfor the gradual overcoming of the most acute problems of\r\nthis transitional stage. I am convinced that the agreements\r\nreached in Moscow will mark a transition towards radically\r\nnew relations, that is, market relations, and will inevitably\r\nlead to the formation on that basis of the eastern European\r\ncommonwealth, a geopolitical and economic group of a\r\nmarket type that will gradually, but at the same time\r\nconsistently and unswervingly, become integrated into\r\nEuropean and world economic structures.\r\nThese new prospects encourage us also because they\r\nwill help Belarus, I hope, in the near future to strengthen its\r\nreal capacity to pay and settle to a large extent the problem\r\nof our financial obligations to the United Nations.\r\nWe are well aware of the acuteness of the financial\r\nsituation of the Organization. That is why, despite our own\r\nextremely difficult economic and financial situation, the\r\nGovernment of Belarus recently made a contribution\r\namounting to $3.5 million to the budget of the Organization\r\nand, in effect, has fully settled its arrears. I wish to assure\r\nMembers of the United Nations that we will\r\ncontinue to do what we can within our very limited\r\nresources. But the United Nations itself through its main\r\norgan the General Assembly must take steps to have the\r\nfinancial obligations of Belarus strictly match our real\r\ncapacity to pay. In particular the new realities warrant a\r\ndecision without further delay on the relocation of our\r\ncountry from Group B to Group C in the scheme of the\r\napportionment of expenses for United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nAt the beginning of my statement I mentioned the great\r\nhopes for the future which Belarus places on United Nations\r\nactivities. However, there is one very special area for us in\r\nwhich United Nations assistance is vitally important, and that\r\nis the environment and our \"eternal wound that does not\r\nheal\" - Chernobyl - the most terrible nuclear disaster.\r\nAlong with the growth of cancer, especially among\r\nchildren, of great concern to us recently has been the social\r\nand psychological stress among our people. The birth rate\r\nhas fallen dramatically and the number of psychogenic\r\ndiseases has been growing rapidly. People are overwhelmed\r\nby a concern about their health and the health of their\r\nchildren. This has also affected the pace of the Republic’s\r\ntransition to new social and economic realities. We call\r\nupon the United Nations, in close cooperation with the\r\nCommission of the European Communities, to continue their\r\nefforts to further study and overcome the consequences of\r\nthe Chernobyl disaster. We hope that in the process of\r\nreforming the United Nations system and its Secretariat the\r\nnecessary institutional and programme mechanisms will be\r\nworked out to further carry out Chernobyl-related activities\r\nin the interests of the entire international community, taking\r\ninto consideration the great significance and uniqueness of\r\nthe lessons of the Chernobyl tragedy.\r\nThe activities carried out by the new United Nations\r\nCoordinator on Chernobyl, Mr. Jan Eliasson, the beginning\r\nof whose work is greatly appreciated by us, gives us hope\r\nthat the United Nations potential will be used actively\r\nenough to yield tangible practical results.\r\nIn the post-Chernobyl era we need moral and\r\npsychological support, sometimes simply compassion. In\r\nthis connection I should like to recall the words of a great\r\nRussian writer, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who is connected to\r\nBelarus by birth. He once declared that beauty and the\r\nnobility of human relations would save the world. To that\r\nI would add compassion because they in effect are\r\ninseparable since beauty is always noble while compassion\r\nand nobility are always beautiful.\r\nBelarus, living through the post-Chernobyl nightmare,\r\nhaving over centuries survived the nightmare of many raids,\r\ninvasions and wars, poverty and hardship, understands the\r\npain, the suffering, of the peoples of the developing\r\ncountries as no other country does. Poverty, diseases, child\r\nmortality, in many parts of the world cannot leave people of\r\ngood will indifferent. Indeed it is immoral to fail to take\r\nnote of this. I am convinced that the new world order will\r\nentail a fairer distribution of the world’s wealth and it will\r\nbe marked by assistance to those who for decades have been\r\nunjustifiably doomed to poverty, stagnation and predictable\r\nbackwardness and have had to be content with the remaining\r\ncrumbs of the wealth produced by them but then\r\nredistributed and not in their favour.\r\nAs one of the original members of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development, our country is striving to\r\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncontribute to its work in a way that reflects the ecological\r\nand economic interests of all groups of States in a balanced\r\nmanner. We support efforts to elaborate an international\r\nconvention on desertification; the search for a solution to the\r\nproblems of the small developing island States; and the\r\nsearch for new and additional resources for developing\r\ncountries.\r\nAware, under the conditions of post-Chernobyl realities,\r\nof the significance of ecological problems in finding a\r\nsolution, Belarus has been actively supporting the\r\nimplementation of the decisions and recommendations of the\r\nfirst-ever summit in history held in the interests of the Earth.\r\nThe Parliament of the Republic of Belarus has already\r\nratified the Convention on Biological Diversity and is now\r\nexamining the issue of acceding to the Convention on\r\nClimate Change. We support priority consideration of\r\necological problems within the context of international\r\ncooperation, and the Republic of Belarus supports the idea\r\nof transforming, in the near future, the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development into the United Nations council on\r\necological security. We are ready to contribute to the\r\nelaboration of its structure and mandate.\r\nThe United Nations is moving from the old epoch to\r\nthe new one with an imposing baggage. Certain parts of it\r\nhave already become obsolete and will be of interest only to\r\nhistorical researchers; others contain the grains of that new\r\nfuture role to be played by the United Nations in this quickly\r\nevolving world which I have already spoken about - for\r\nexample, a positive and future-oriented experience of large-\r\nscale peace-keeping operations in Namibia and Cambodia.\r\nStanding on the threshold of the third millennium, one can\r\nhardly envisage all of the details of the general picture of the\r\nfuture world. However, the prospects that lie ahead are what\r\nmatters most, and they are clearly visible. From the role of\r\ncease-fire organizer to the role of peace guarantor, from the\r\nrole of peace guarantor to the role of co-organizer of life in\r\nthe international community, a wise and authoritative\r\narbitrator whose political will is without doubt recognized by\r\nall: that is the way we see the role of the United Nations in\r\nthe next century. Meeting the challenges of the time,\r\nBelarus is ready to work together with other friendly States,\r\nincluding, if this is the will of the General Assembly, within\r\nthe Security Council of the United Nations.\r\nMr. POOS (Luxembourg): First of all, I should like to\r\nextend to the President of the General Assembly at this\r\nforty-eighth session my sincere congratulations on his\r\nelection. He was unanimously supported for this position\r\nbecause of his excellent qualities; and his election is also a\r\ntribute to his country, Guyana.\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our Secretary-General, also\r\ndeserves our wholehearted thanks and appreciation for his\r\nconstant and resolute efforts in implementing the decisions\r\nof our Organization and applying the principles of our\r\nCharter.\r\nThe already very broad universality of the United\r\nNations has been further strengthened - and I welcome this -\r\nwith the admission of six new countries: the Czech\r\nRepublic, the Slovak Republic, Eritrea, The Former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco and Andorra.\r\nMr. Willy Claes, the Belgian Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, yesterday expressed the views of the European\r\nCommunity and its member States. I shall therefore be able\r\nin this statement to focus on a few matters of particular\r\nconcern to my Government.\r\nThree years ago, from this very rostrum, we welcomed\r\nthe end of the East-West confrontation and its corollary, the\r\nend of the threat of nuclear annihilation. Throughout the\r\nworld, democracy and respect for the state of law were\r\nprogressing in a most encouraging way. But given\r\ndevelopments in the last few years, it would seem that we\r\nshould somehow dampen our enthusiasm.\r\nChanges in the balance of forces between the Powers\r\nthat dominated the old order have allowed nationalism and\r\nregionalism to develop. In some cases, this has led to the\r\ndestabilization of entire regions following upon rivalries\r\nbetween neighbors, ethnic tension and religious fanaticism.\r\nNationalism is of course not in and of itself evil. It is\r\nin some sense a logical manifestation of feelings of pride\r\nand self-confidence which can finally express themselves\r\nafter long years of oppression during which free speech was\r\nforcibly repressed.\r\nBut once the legitimate expression of this regained\r\npride of a people is transformed into open hostility towards\r\neverything that is different, then nationalism carries within\r\nitself the seeds of grave danger.\r\nExtreme nationalism can be seen in many places,\r\nwhether it be in the territory of the former Soviet Union or\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, where it has found its most\r\nintolerable expression. It leads to explosions of violence,\r\narmed aggression, acts of terrorism and unspeakable\r\nsuffering for the civilian populations.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 31\r\nEthnic conflicts are proliferating in all regions of the\r\nworld. In Western Europe itself, it can be seen in the\r\nresurgence of racist and xenophobic incidents.\r\nAs a challenge to the primacy of law and to respect for\r\nhuman rights, extreme nationalism constitutes a threat to the\r\ninternational order.\r\nA clear and coherent strategy is necessary to respond to\r\nthis challenge.\r\nFirst of all, education with regard to tolerance should be\r\nrenewed; and, secondly, legal protection for minorities must\r\nbe ensured.\r\nThe principles and rules drawn up in this area by the\r\nCouncil of Europe and the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe might suggest some solutions. New\r\ninstruments are to be defined next week at the summit of the\r\nCouncil of Europe. The plan for stability in Europe is part\r\nof this same approach.\r\nThirdly - and this is the most important action to be\r\ntaken - we must do everything possible at the national,\r\nregional and international levels to strengthen\r\ndemocratization and to promote protection for human rights.\r\nIt is on the basis of these principles, focused on the free\r\nexpression of peoples and the development of democratic\r\nstructures, that the United Nations has proposed solutions\r\nand agreements to resolve the conflicts which are being\r\nsubmitted to it in ever-increasing numbers.\r\nThe Government of Luxembourg expresses its deep\r\nsatisfaction over the agreement on mutual recognition and\r\nthe agreement on the autonomy of occupied territories\r\nconcluded between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe should like to pay tribute to those who forged the\r\nagreements, in particular Prime Minister Rabin, his Foreign\r\nMinister Peres and President Arafat. They have given the\r\nworld a lesson in courage and clarity of vision and in\r\npolitical realism as well.\r\nThe developments we have witnessed are of a historic\r\nsignificance comparable to that of the collapse of the Berlin\r\nWall. They fundamentally change the facts of the Middle\r\nEast; they have launched a process of reconciliation in order\r\nto put an end to an explosive, untenable and unjust situation.\r\nIn a region devastated by more than 40 years of war,\r\nviolence and hatred, a window is now opening on a more\r\npeaceful and democratic future. The still fragile dynamic\r\nthat has been created must be strengthened without delay.\r\nThis can first be achieved by the conclusion of peace\r\nagreements between Israel and its neighbours: Lebanon,\r\nJordan and Syria. The Government of Luxembourg\r\nencourages the leaders concerned to overcome the last\r\nobstacles and to open the way to normalization of their\r\nrelations with Israel.\r\nThe Israelis and the Palestinians must then act together\r\nand in good faith, with the solidarity of the regional and\r\ninternational community to implement successfully the\r\nagreement on autonomy in the occupied territories, the first\r\nstep towards a comprehensive settlement. The first\r\ncontributor of funds, the European Community and its\r\nmember States, is prepared to increase cooperation on behalf\r\nof a population that must be helped to emerge from poverty\r\nand build a more dignified and prosperous future. Our\r\nGovernment will participate fully in that effort.\r\nThanks to the United Nations, peace was restored in\r\nNamibia and Nicaragua three years ago.\r\nToday in Cambodia the effort led by the United Nations\r\nhas enabled the people of an ancient culture, humiliated by\r\ndecades of bloody oppression and foreign occupation, to\r\nparticipate on a mass scale in free and open elections. By\r\nconsolidating a State of law and national reconciliation, the\r\ncountry will be able to rebuild itself.\r\nIn Haiti a firm policy of close cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of American States\r\n(OAS) has led to an agreement which provides for the\r\nrestoration of democracy.\r\nIn El Salvador the assistance of the United Nations was\r\ndecisive in putting an end to the civil war and recommencing\r\nthe construction of a civilian society and the process of\r\nnational reconciliation. Free elections in which all\r\nSalvadorians will be able to participate are to be held next\r\nyear.\r\nIn Somalia, however, intervention by the United\r\nNations has demonstrated the limits of armed intervention in\r\na tribal civil war in the absence of a political agreement and\r\na cease-fire. Nevertheless, the difficulties encountered in\r\nMogadishu should not make us forget that the United\r\nNations made an essential contribution to combating the\r\nfamine.\r\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn South Africa further decisive progress is being made\r\ntowards the definitive abolition of apartheid. I welcome the\r\nagreement on setting up a transitional body to draw up a\r\nprovisional Constitution and prepare for free elections in\r\nApril 1994. Only a shared determination and close\r\ncooperation between all the parties will make it possible to\r\nstop the deadly violence which continues to kill and which\r\njeopardizes the process of reconciliation.\r\nSignificant progress towards restoring democracy and\r\ntowards national reconciliation has also been made in other\r\ncountries in Central America and in Africa.\r\nThose achievements, however imperfect, are\r\nencouraging, and demonstrate the role that our Organization\r\ncan play in preserving peace and consolidating democratic\r\nregimes.\r\nThe situation in the former Yugoslavia is still extremely\r\ndisturbing. Every day we see on television the barbarism\r\nthat accompanies \"ethnic cleansing\" and the bloodstained\r\ndismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina -a country which\r\nwas once an example of ethnic and religious coexistence.\r\nThe agreement between the three Bosnian parties,\r\nwhich has yet to be finalized, is admittedly complex and far\r\nfrom perfect. Yet it has the merit of opening up the\r\nprospect of putting an end to terror and violence. It offers\r\na comprehensive arrangement for emerging from the crisis.\r\nIts success, which is far from being assured, presupposes a\r\nreal desire on the part of the three parties to reach agreement\r\nand to carry out and abide by what is signed. The European\r\nCommunity and its member States, where necessary assisted\r\nby the Western European Union (WEU), are ready to\r\ncontribute to implementation of the agreement, in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations, the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO) and the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Sanctions could be\r\nlifted when the various Security Council resolutions on the\r\nformer Yugoslavia have been implemented and when a\r\nsatisfactory solution to the problem of minorities has been\r\nfound.\r\nOverall, our Organization’s peace-keeping activities\r\nhave reached an unprecedented level. Almost 80,000 Blue\r\nHelmets, military and civilian, are in the field in an\r\nunparalleled number of humanitarian missions and peace-\r\nkeeping operations. I pay tribute to all those who serve the\r\ncause of peace and in particular to those who have lost their\r\nlives during these actions. We have a duty to ensure better\r\nsecurity for personnel.\r\nLuxembourg, itself born as a modern State of an\r\ninternational treaty guaranteed by the Powers of the time, is\r\nparticularly sensitive to the need for security and the need to\r\npreserve the peace. It has therefore contributed actively to\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, sending military\r\npersonnel and making suitable financial contributions. My\r\nGovernment intends to continue this cooperation in the\r\nfuture.\r\nLuxembourg also firmly supports the efforts to step up\r\nUnited Nations activities in the area of preventive\r\ndiplomacy. These efforts must be increased. Measures such\r\nas fact-finding missions, the use of rapid alert systems, the\r\nestablishment of a rapid deployment group, and a\r\nreinforcement of the roles of regional organizations could all\r\nbe very useful in preventing conflict. Once a conflict has\r\nbeen unleashed it requires a much more costly intervention\r\nto ensure the restoration of peace.\r\nNew cooperation is developing between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations, which will increasingly\r\nbe called upon to carry out peace-keeping functions at their\r\nlevel or to support and supplement United Nations activities\r\nin the area of collective security. The WEU, of which my\r\ncountry currently holds the presidency, is in the course of\r\ndefining its role in peace-keeping operations. NATO and the\r\nCSCE are doing likewise.\r\nThe preservation of peace and the promotion of\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law go hand in hand with the\r\nprotection of human rights.\r\nOver the years, our Organization has succeeded in\r\ndeveloping and progressively codifying human rights. But\r\nthat is not enough; we must also see to it that these rights\r\nare better respected. The annual reports of organizations\r\ninvolved in the defence of human rights show that we are\r\nstill far from attaining that objective.\r\nWe are pleased that the Vienna Conference on Human\r\nRights allowed encouraging progress to be made. The\r\nuniversality of human rights was clearly affirmed. Specific\r\nproposals were made for ensuring broader knowledge of\r\nhuman rights, promoting them and respecting them. It is\r\nnow for this Assembly to approve those proposals, including\r\nthe establishment of a High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights.\r\nThere is an indissoluble link between respect for human\r\nrights and the promotion of democracy. Within the United\r\nNations system this link takes concrete form in the\r\nOrganization’s growing activities in the area of technical\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 33\r\nassistance and international supervision of electoral\r\nprocesses. I support the proposals by our Secretary-General\r\nto broaden these support activities to include the\r\nestablishment of a free press, political parties and an\r\nindependent judiciary.\r\nIn this context, I welcome the decision taken by\r\nPresident Yeltsin to organize free elections in order to ensure\r\ndemocratic legitimacy for all State bodies in Russia.\r\nThe United Nations must also increase its activities in\r\nthe economic, social and environmental areas. This will also\r\nrequire the continued courageous reform of its structures and\r\nworking methods.\r\nWe can have no lasting peace while peoples are\r\nsubjected to abject poverty and famine and while they have\r\nno hope for progress towards greater justice and equality.\r\nCooperation and trade: these are the two foci of a single\r\npolicy, which must be followed. In the past few years my\r\nGovernment has doubled the aid it designates for\r\ndevelopment and cooperation. We are in favour of the swift\r\nconclusion of a balanced agreement in the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Such an\r\nagreement can provide at the world level a new impetus to\r\ntrade and economic relations.\r\nFollowing the Rio Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, the new Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment must be determined to ensure that the\r\ncommitments entered into at that Conference are followed\r\nup.\r\nThe world’s population has more than doubled over the\r\npast 40 years and according to estimates will double again\r\nin the next 30 years. The international community must\r\nengage in a thorough analysis of the consequences of that\r\nlevel of growth - for example, the problems of refugees,\r\nurban concentration, and the enormous constraints in the\r\nareas of food, housing, health and education. That is why\r\nthe Conference on Population and Development to be held\r\nin Cairo in 1994 has such importance.\r\nIt is not surprising that social problems are becoming\r\nincreasingly important at a time when many economies are\r\nfacing difficult adjustment processes and others are carrying\r\nout a delicate transition from a planned economy to a market\r\neconomy. Moreover, all recently published reports confirm\r\nthat there is a disturbing increase in the gap between the\r\nrichest sectors and the poorest sectors of populations, both\r\nwithin countries and between countries.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development which will\r\ntake place in 1995 will, if it is adequately prepared, offer the\r\ninternational community an opportunity to develop a strategy\r\nto combat poverty and to ensure the better distribution of\r\nwealth.\r\nMore than a year ago the Secretary-General issued his\r\nreport \"An Agenda for Peace\", which was designed to\r\nstrengthen the Organization’s capacities in the area of\r\npreventive diplomacy and the maintenance and restoration of\r\npeace. Some of the proposals it contains are already being\r\napplied in practice, but others are still pending. We hope\r\nthat the current review of the Agenda will lead to specific\r\nresults that can meet the Organization’s needs.\r\nReform of the Security Council is a delicate issue\r\nwhich touches on the very heart of international post-war\r\ncooperation. The Council has now been in operation for\r\n50 years, and the time has come to have a candid and in-\r\ndepth discussion of the question. The fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe Organization in 1995 could offer us a good opportunity\r\nto do this.\r\nThe second crisis facing the United Nations - and this\r\npoint has been emphasized in all the statements made here\r\nso far - is the chronic budget deficit. To put it bluntly, the\r\nUnited Nations is bordering on insolvency. This is all the\r\nmore astonishing in that the annual budget of the\r\nOrganization is about the same as that of a medium-sized\r\ncity.\r\nThe legal obligation that binds all Member States\r\nmakes it incumbent on them to pay their financial\r\ncontributions in full and at the proper time. The credibility\r\nand the operational capacity of the United Nations depend on\r\nthis.\r\nIn conclusion, let me turn to an old Europe.\r\nIn building European union the members of the\r\nEuropean Community have tried to seize an unprecedented\r\nopportunity for the entire continent to achieve a truly unified\r\nEurope, a Europe of countries that have often made war\r\nagainst each other in the past.\r\nWithout denying the current difficulties, I believe that\r\nthe process of integration being carried out by the European\r\nCommunity can serve as the inspiration for initiatives for\r\nregional integration in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\r\nEuropean unification was thought up and implemented\r\non the basis of principles that are still fully valid:\r\nreconciliation between peoples that only yesterday were\r\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nenemies; broad-ranging political, economic, commercial and\r\ncultural cooperation; and the development of a social model\r\nbased on pluralistic democracy, the market economy and\r\nsolidarity. Such a model guarantees justice and social\r\ncohesion even if we are never able to make it perfect and it\r\nmust be constantly adjusted.\r\nIt is on the basis of these common values that all the\r\npeoples of Europe can, for the first time in their history,\r\nbuild their future together. I believe that at the world level\r\nalso, thanks to concerted international action, we will be in\r\na better position to overcome the obstacles to peace and to\r\ncreate a world order that is more democratic, more tolerant,\r\nmore just and more social - in a word, more in keeping with\r\nthe spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMr. HAN (Republic of Korea): May I congratulate\r\nAmbassador Insanally of Guyana on his assumption of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession. I also wish to acknowledge the excellent work done\r\nby His Excellency Ambassador Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria as\r\nPresident of the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nI also pay tribute to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedication to the cause\r\nof the United Nations and to its reform at this important\r\njuncture.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to express my\r\nwarmest welcome to the new Member States - Andorra, the\r\nCzech Republic, Eritrea, the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Monaco and the Slovak Republic. My\r\ndelegation wishes them every success and looks forward to\r\nworking closely with them in all areas.\r\nWe live in an age of historic transition. This is\r\nconfirmed by the dramatic changes in the international\r\nsituation since the last session. A new world order, which\r\nis fundamentally different from the old one, is taking shape.\r\nWe are witnessing a trend towards peace, cooperation and\r\ninterdependence, instead of conflict, confrontation and\r\nideological bigotry. The most resounding testimony to this\r\neffect emerged in the peace accord between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization signed in Washington this\r\nmonth.\r\nToday we find ourselves in an international\r\nenvironment that was only a vision to the founding fathers\r\nof the United Nations. I should like to quote from the\r\nremarks of Mr. Oswaldo Aranha, a distinguished diplomat\r\nfrom Brazil, who was the President of the General Assembly\r\nin 1947. He said:\r\n\"All idea of force is today obsolete and negative. The\r\nold order, based on political power, is trying to survive,\r\nbut there is no longer room for predominance through\r\nforce. The United Nations stands for the new order,\r\nbased on peaceful accord, on understanding, on free\r\ndiscussion ... and on the common and equal\r\nresponsibility of peoples.\" (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Second Session, Plenary Meeting,\"\r\n128th meeting, p. 1442)\r\nForty-five years after these words were spoken, we\r\nfinally stand at the end of one era and on the threshold of a\r\nnew one. This may be a second, and perhaps the last,\r\nopportunity for us to fulfil the stated mission of the United\r\nNations at its creation.\r\nTo be sure, the end of the cold war does not mean the\r\nend of all problems. The world worries about the continuing\r\nand even worsening ethnic and religious conflicts. We face\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Environmental protection is another major\r\nchallenge to today’s world. Development cannot be taken\r\nfor granted. These are monumental issues that require the\r\ncollective efforts of all members of the international\r\ncommunity, and of the United Nations in particular.\r\nWe have entered an age of diversity and uncertainty,\r\nbut we should not be daunted by this new reality. We may\r\nnot be accustomed to it, but we should not be afraid of\r\nliving in a pluralistic world. Nations differ in what they\r\nwant to achieve and in how they want to achieve it. These\r\ndiverse goals, while constituting a possible source of\r\nconflict, should also form the basis for complementarity and\r\ncooperation among nations.\r\nSome say that bipolarity is being replaced by\r\nmultipolarity. Yet \"pluralistic\", rather than \"multipolar\", is\r\nperhaps more precise a term to describe the emerging world\r\norder. A multipolar world would postulate geopolitics based\r\nupon conflict and balance of power. A pluralistic world, on\r\nthe other hand, accepts diversity and encourages cooperation.\r\nThus, the world has the potential to become more democratic\r\nand harmonious than it has ever been in history.\r\nOne of the most noteworthy changes in the aftermath\r\nof the cold war is the strengthening of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly in the field of peace and security. The \"Agenda\r\nfor Peace\" report that Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali\r\nsubmitted last year provides a solid base on which to\r\naugment the role of the United Nations in this area.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 35\r\nPreventive diplomacy, in particular, is of the utmost\r\nimportance, given the enormous human and material costs of\r\nconflicts once they break out. My delegation will continue\r\nits participation in the efforts to translate into a meaningful\r\nreality such initiatives as \"preventive diplomacy\" and\r\n\"post-conflict peace-building\".\r\nAs the continuing tragedies in Bosnia and Somalia\r\ndemonstrate, conflicts fuelled by ethnic and religious\r\ndifferences, poverty and internal disorder are becoming a\r\nnew and major threat to international security. In response\r\nto increasing demands, 17 United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations are active in different parts of the world.\r\nHowever, traditional peace-keeping may no longer be\r\na sufficient response to current conflicts. We find that the\r\nscope of these operations is widening, ranging from the\r\nsupervision of a cease-fire to nation-building. Furthermore,\r\nthe timely deployment of peace-keepers is imperative to\r\ntemper a conflict at an early stage.\r\nFor this reason, we believe that the proposed\r\nmechanism of United Nations stand-by forces is an\r\nappropriate way to enhance the Organization’s role in\r\nmeeting new challenges to peace. The availability of\r\nstand-by forces will enable the United Nations to provide a\r\nquick and effective response to conflicts.\r\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm my Government’s\r\nsupport of the United Nations Operation in Somalia\r\n(UNOSOM II). We dispatched an engineering battalion in\r\nJune, and we urge all the factions concerned in Somalia to\r\ncooperate fully with the United Nations. Given the\r\nsuccessful precedent set by the United Nations Transitional\r\nAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC), I am confident that\r\nUNOSOM II will also fulfill its peacekeeping mission.\r\nNone the less, it is a source of grave concern that the\r\nnumber of United Nations casualties in Somalia is sharply\r\nincreasing. Effective arrangements need to be worked out to\r\nenhance the safety and security of those who are involved in\r\nthe United Nations peace-keeping operations there and\r\neverywhere else.\r\nIn the domain of peace and security, preventing the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, both nuclear\r\nand biochemical, is another critical task.\r\nThe Republic of Korea strongly supports the efforts to\r\nstop nuclear-weapons proliferation beyond 1995 through the\r\nextension of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). We\r\nalso support the strengthening of International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) safeguards as the central device for\r\nensuring the effectiveness of the NPT.\r\nAt the same time, consistent with the spirit and\r\nobjective of the NPT, we urge the existing nuclear Powers\r\nnot only to accelerate their efforts to reduce their nuclear\r\narsenal but also actively to join the efforts for a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. That will encourage\r\nnon-nuclear countries to adhere and agree to an indefinite\r\nextension of the NPT régime. My delegation welcomes the\r\ncommitment of nuclear-weapon States to a continuing\r\nmoratorium on nuclear testing.\r\nWith regard to chemical and biological weapons, the\r\nconclusion of the chemical weapons Convention in January\r\nwas a big step forward. We urge those States that have not\r\nyet joined the Convention to do so as early as possible. The\r\nConvention, together with the biological weapons\r\nConvention, will serve as a major instrument in preventing\r\nproliferation of biochemical weapons.\r\nWith the ending of the cold war, disarmament has\r\nmoved into the realm of real possibility. Over the past few\r\nyears disarmament has gained momentum with agreements\r\non nuclear-arms reduction and cut-backs in conventional\r\nforces. We have to keep this momentum alive. In the light\r\nof these developments, the October 1992 report of the\r\nSecretary-General on \"New dimensions of arms regulation\r\nand disarmament in the post-cold war era\" has offered timely\r\nand useful guidelines for disarmament.\r\nAt the same time, we should take note of the ongoing\r\nreassessment of multilateral disarmament machinery. The\r\nConference on Disarmament is particularly important as the\r\nsingle multilateral disarmament negotiating forum. In my\r\ndelegation’s view, the Conference on Disarmament should be\r\nappropriately expanded in membership to reflect the changed\r\ninternational environment.\r\nIn addition, the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms that was launched with the participation\r\nof more than 70 Member States should be implemented on\r\na universal basis as soon as possible.\r\nAs I discuss the issue of disarmament, I need to draw\r\nattention to the Korean peninsula. Despite the worldwide\r\ntrends towards peace and cooperation, there is still tension\r\nin Korea.\r\nMy Government believes that the solution to the inter-\r\nKorean question should be sought in the context of the post--\r\ncold-war international order of reconciliation and\r\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\ncooperation. This means active participation by both North\r\nand South Korea in the regional and global order.\r\nWe are particularly concerned with the North Korean\r\nnuclear programme. North Korea should cooperate in\r\nremoving any suspicions surrounding it by honouring its\r\nnon-proliferation obligations under the NPT.\r\nIn conformity with the Security Council resolution\r\n825 (1993), the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea must\r\ncomply with its safeguards agreement with IAEA. At the\r\nsame time, we urge the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea to cooperate with us in implementing the 1991\r\ninter-Korean Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the\r\nKorean Peninsula.\r\nMy delegation is also deeply concerned about the safety\r\nof North Korean nuclear power reactors. The International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the countries concerned\r\nshould pay special attention to the safety issue as well as to\r\nthe non-proliferation question in relation to the North Korean\r\nnuclear program.\r\nThere are several urgent issues of a non-military nature\r\nwhose solution requires a global approach. Development\r\nand trade, environment, and human rights are some of them.\r\nThe post-cold war international environment both\r\nrequires and enables us to place greater emphasis on\r\neconomic and social development. We should now devote\r\nthe peace dividend to development efforts. Given the high\r\ndegree of interdependence in today’s world, no country is\r\nimmune from the consequences of economic difficulties in\r\nother countries. Poverty, population problems and\r\nenvironmental degradation have become a common threat to\r\nthe well-being of mankind. These non-military crises are\r\nnow the issues to be addressed with a sense of urgency and\r\ncollective endeavour by all nations.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in this area should be\r\nstrengthened. I welcome the recent initiatives to restructure\r\nand revitalize the United Nations system in the economic\r\nand social field. The structure of the system should be\r\nstreamlined for effective mobilization of limited resources.\r\nMeanwhile, I believe a substantial increase in development\r\nresources is necessary to support developmental cooperation.\r\nDeveloped countries are encouraged to enhance their efforts\r\nin this area.\r\nTo achieve a more prosperous world, we need to\r\nstrengthen the global free trade regime. The regime of the\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) was created\r\nshortly after the founding of the United Nations. The\r\nunderlying philosophy was clear: peace and security can\r\nbest be guaranteed if buttressed by economic prosperity.\r\nDuring the cold-war period, this global free trade regime\r\nexceeded early expectations by bringing wealth and\r\nprosperity to those who embraced it. Now that the cold war\r\nis over, the whole world can more fully benefit from it.\r\nOur choice is clear. We must strengthen the free trade\r\nsystem, by ensuring a successful conclusion of the Uruguay\r\nRound.\r\nEconomic development is closely linked with the\r\nenvironment issue. It was at the Rio Summit last year that\r\nthe world was keenly awakened to this critical issue. The\r\nSummit emphatically stressed the importance of global\r\npartnership to achieve environmentally sound and sustainable\r\ndevelopment towards the twenty-first century.\r\nWhen we deal with environmental problems, it is\r\nimportant to strike a balance between the North and the\r\nSouth. The former focuses on the primacy of environmental\r\nprotection while the latter emphasizes the development\r\nimperatives. We believe that the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment is a very appropriate forum for seeking such\r\na balance and coordinating the implementation of the results\r\nof the United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment.\r\nAs a member of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, the Republic of Korea is ready to do its part\r\nin contributing to global action. We hope to help bridge the\r\ndivergences between the developed and the developing\r\ncountries. We are now in the process of joining the\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and other\r\nenvironmental agreements.\r\nThe human rights issue is receiving growing attention\r\non the international level. This may be a natural\r\nphenomenon as the emerging pluralistic world society\r\nfacilitates the promotion of democracy all over the world.\r\nAt the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna\r\nin June, I had the privilege to report to the forum that human\r\nrights have finally come of age in Korea. I also pledged our\r\nfirm support for the international movements to promote\r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action are\r\nthe most significant results of the Conference. We must take\r\nthe necessary follow-up measures. In five years we will\r\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights of 1948. I hope that our\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 37\r\ngeneration will be able to meet the expectation set by those\r\nwho produced this Declaration.\r\nAs we pay due attention to the human rights issue, we\r\nshould also concern ourselves with the question of refugees\r\nand disadvantaged groups. Armed conflicts and natural\r\ndisasters around the world raise the need for humanitarian\r\nassistance and protection of refugees and displaced persons.\r\nThe Republic of Korea’s recent accession to the Convention\r\nrelating to the status of refugees testifies to its commitment\r\nto this cause.\r\nI attach special significance to the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development which will take place in 1995 in\r\nCopenhagen. I hope that effective programmes of action\r\nwill be put forward at this Conference to tackle major\r\nimpediments to social development.\r\nAs the United Nations faces new opportunities and\r\nchallenges, it also needs reforms in order to cope with them\r\nbetter. This is indeed a tall order.\r\nWe believe that, with the enormous increase in the\r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations, it has become\r\nnecessary to enlarge the Security Council. The question is\r\nhow to enlarge the Council without sacrificing its\r\neffectiveness. The creation of a third category, with long-\r\nterm membership but without the power of veto, coupled\r\nwith the expansion of the non-permanent membership, may\r\nbe an answer.\r\nConcerning the General Assembly, the simplification of\r\nthe committee structure, through the merger of the Fourth\r\nCommittee and the Special Political Committee, will\r\nundoubtedly enhance its efficiency. The rationalization of\r\nthe agenda may be another measure to help enhance the\r\ncapability of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\nmeasures to reform the Secretariat and supports him in this\r\ncomplex task. In particular, the recent establishment of the\r\nOffice of the Assistant Secretary-General for Inspections and\r\nInvestigations is an initial step towards increasing the\r\naccountability of the Secretariat.\r\nI note with concern the report of the Secretary-General\r\nthat refers to the financial status of the United Nations. We\r\nfully agree with him that in order to enable this Organization\r\nto meet the demands of its time, the resources provided\r\nshould match its political will. My delegation is in favor of\r\nconstructive discussions during the current session which\r\nwould explore ways and means of alleviating the current\r\nfinancial difficulties of the United Nations.\r\nI believe the reform should be based on a proper\r\nunderstanding of the changed world situation. It should also\r\nconform with the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations. I hope this process will lead to an efficient and\r\nproductive United Nations that is truly capable of fulfilling\r\nthe aspirations of mankind by the year 1995, the world\r\nbody’s fiftieth anniversary.\r\nGiven the vital role that the United Nations has played\r\nin the Republic of Korea, we will observe this occasion with\r\nparticular dedication. A national committee will be formed\r\nand activities will be coordinated with the Secretariat, with\r\nspecial emphasis on conveying the message of the United\r\nNations to Korea’s next generation.\r\nIn the Republic of Korea, the new Government has\r\nlaunched a reorientation of foreign policy. Our new\r\ndiplomacy places emphasis on universal values - peace,\r\ndemocracy, liberty, welfare and human rights. Globalism is\r\nat the core of the new diplomacy.\r\nKorea is pursuing a more active role in tackling global\r\nissues such as international peace and security, disarmament,\r\nthe eradication of poverty, protection of the environment and\r\nefficient utilization of natural resources. It is through such\r\nengagement in global affairs that Korea seeks to play its due\r\npart in the activities of the United Nations designed to make\r\nthe world a safer, more just and more prosperous place.\r\nThe Republic of Korea is now participating in the\r\nUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II). It is\r\nalso serving a three-year term on the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. We shall actively seek ways to increase our\r\ncontribution to international organizations, especially those\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations.\r\nIn this regard, the Republic of Korea hopes to better\r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity by having an opportunity to serve on the Security\r\nCouncil. We hope to receive the encouragement and support\r\nof the world community in these efforts.\r\nDemocratization, and harmony between nations, are the\r\nmost important trends of the new world order. By drawing\r\nupon them, we have the opportunity to make the future more\r\npeaceful and secure than ever before in the history of\r\nmankind. Our success or failure will depend upon our\r\nunderstanding of the nature of the new order and our ability\r\nto build on it.\r\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nTo be sure, there are dangers also. We failed with the\r\nLeague of Nations. We often experienced bitter frustration\r\nduring the cold war period. Yet, we are on the threshold of\r\na new beginning. We need to look forward, because the\r\nfuture is in our hands. We have to prove to ourselves that\r\nwe are equal to the task.\r\nMr. McKINNON (New Zealand): The United Nations\r\nis our Organization; we are its custodians, and we have to\r\nadjust to change. We have a huge responsibility to pass it\r\non in better shape than we found it. Historians in future\r\nyears will acknowledge this period of radical change.\r\nBut what are the objectives of this Organization of ours\r\nin 1993? Well, they are not very difficult to enumerate,\r\nbecause they are set out for us and by us in the Preamble to\r\nthe Charter, and they remain as valid today as they were\r\nwhen they were agreed in 1945.\r\nThe first, of course, is peace, because without peace\r\nand security no human society can flourish; then human\r\ndignity, because if we do not treat each other with respect as\r\nindividuals, we will not do so as nations; justice, because\r\nunless relations between nations are grounded in law, the\r\npowerful will always be able to triumph over the weak;\r\nsocial and economic progress, because without the sustained\r\nand sustainable development of our economies, all our other\r\nachievements will be as nothing.\r\nI believe that to this list we must now add the\r\nmaintenance of a clean and attractive environment. We are\r\nlearning, painfully, that our planet also has rights. We\r\nignore them only at our peril.\r\nThese are the foundations for the vision of what the\r\nworld should be. In New Zealand, we would say that they\r\ngive opportunities to all. When the United Nations came\r\ninto existence almost 50 years ago, the vision was sharper\r\nthan the reality, but the founders of the United Nations were\r\ncertainly not deterred. They were at the watershed in the\r\naffairs of the world. They had just experienced the awful\r\nreality of a global conflict in which millions had died, and\r\nthey were determined to do everything in their power to\r\nmake sure that such a conflict could never occur again.\r\nThey did build well. They embodied their vision not only\r\nin this Organization but also in a whole series of economic,\r\nfinancial, social and humanitarian institutions, and they gave\r\nit the only strength that counted: their sheer determination,\r\nas men and women from very different countries, to make\r\nit happen.\r\nOnly the utmost patience and perseverance has kept that\r\ndream and that determination alive through most of the\r\n50 years since 1945. Progress has been slow and it has been\r\nhalting. Some great things were done, but too often the\r\nMembers of the United Nations could agree only at the\r\nlowest common denominator, a reflection of the political\r\ngaps and strains within the United Nations membership.\r\nThere are, however, four reasons why I believe that that\r\nlong, grey era has closed.\r\nThe first is that the cold war, that shadow and threat of\r\na global conflict, is now over. Freed of that constraint, the\r\nUnited Nations can operate, as it was intended that it should,\r\nas the ultimate guardian of the security of all its Members,\r\nthe ultimate arbiter of world peace.\r\nSecondly, democracy, one of the most effective\r\nguarantors of peace between nations, is spreading. We\r\nwelcome the establishment of democratic institutions and\r\nprocesses in countries that have for too long been without\r\nthem.\r\nThe third point is that in the General Agreement on\r\nTariffs and Trade Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations, the world has a major opportunity to turn its\r\nback on protectionism and lock in the prospects for\r\neconomic growth through trade and other forms of economic\r\nintegration. Freedom and free trade go hand in hand.\r\nFourthly, and last, the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro\r\nand Agenda 21 contain a global consensus, a universal\r\ndetermination to act to preserve our environment.\r\nThis combination of developments marks a new\r\nwatershed; if we are to keep faith with the founders of this\r\nOrganization, we must do what they did in 1945 at their\r\nwatershed, and build well, not just for ourselves, but of\r\ncourse for those who follow.\r\nOn the issue of security and peacemaking, the first\r\npoint that I raised was that the elimination of confrontation\r\nbetween the super-Powers has opened up new possibilities\r\nfor the practice of collective security and peacemaking. The\r\nunfortunate consequence of 50 years of super-Power\r\nconfrontation is, paradoxically, that we are not yet very good\r\nat working together: like a novice sports team, we are really\r\nrather uncoordinated, sadly lacking in strategy, sadly lacking\r\nin team skills or knowledge of the new rules, and sadly\r\nlacking in collective determination. We cannot correct these\r\ndeficiencies overnight, but we must keep on trying to\r\nimprove.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 39\r\nThe other paradox is that peace has not broken out\r\nsimply because the former Soviet Union and the United\r\nStates have stopped squaring off against each other. There\r\nhave been unexpected consequences: some would liken the\r\nresult to taking the lid off a pressure-cooker. Conflicts,\r\ninternal and between neighbours, seem to have burst out\r\neverywhere. These consequences, in human terms, are\r\nhorrific.\r\nSo here we are, in the United Nations, underresourced,\r\nundertrained and facing an enormous peacemaking, peace-\r\nbuilding and peace-keeping challenge. We really have no\r\nalternative to learning as we go, and I believe that we are\r\ndoing so.\r\nDuring the past year, I have spoken to soldiers and\r\nrelief workers in the field in United Nations missions as\r\nwidely spread as Somalia and Croatia, and I pay my highest\r\ntribute to their dedication under some of the most adverse\r\ncircumstances. United Nations people are trying there, as\r\nelsewhere, to create conditions where their work will\r\nultimately no longer be required. They are actually trying to\r\ndo themselves out of a job.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s document \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\" is now in a consolidation phase. The problems are\r\nclear: rising expectations; machinery due for reform; lack of\r\nfunds; and the lack of ready, well-trained and well-equipped\r\nforces. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has already made some\r\nthoughtful proposals, including sending teams to Member\r\nStates to help identify in advance resources available for the\r\nUnited Nations operations. New Zealand is willing to\r\nrespond positively to this approach.\r\nMr. HAN (Republic of Korea), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe Secretary-General has also made organizational\r\nchanges in the Headquarters departments that support peace-\r\nkeeping. The revamping of the Department of Peace-\r\nKeeping Operations is a very good start, providing we\r\nrecognize that we need more than just a shifting of the\r\nresources. The new philosophy of peace-building and\r\npeacemaking must work in tandem with the well-tried and\r\nsuccessful peace-keeping philosophy of the past.\r\nOn the issue of safety and security of United Nations\r\npersonnel, recent peace-keeping operations have highlighted\r\nthe risks to United Nations personnel working in dangerous\r\nand unstable situations. That does not help the recruitment\r\nof peace-keepers, and it does not help the recruitment of\r\ncontributing countries. The United Nations must have the\r\nmeans to hold personally responsible and accountable those\r\nwho attack or commit other acts of violence against the\r\nUnited Nations and associated personnel.\r\nEarlier this year the New Zealand Government took the\r\ninitial step of calling for all possible measures to ensure the\r\nsafety of United Nations personnel. We asked the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to report on the adequacy of existing arrangements.\r\nHis report makes a number of positive recommendations.\r\nHe has highlighted the need for the General Assembly to\r\nelaborate a new multilateral instrument on the role the\r\nSecurity Council might play in setting the appropriate\r\nconditions designed to improve the safety of personnel.\r\nI was very pleased just this afternoon to participate in\r\na Security Council meeting that adopted a resolution\r\nwelcoming the Secretary-General’s report and spelling out\r\nthe conditions the Council will impose in the future for the\r\nprotection of United Nations personnel. I was also delighted\r\nthat the General Assembly last week agreed to New\r\nZealand’s proposal to include a new item on the safety of\r\npersonnel in this year’s agenda. I hope that the Sixth\r\nCommittee will establish a working group to consider the\r\nissue and make urgent progress. I hope the subject will also\r\nbe very fully discussed in all other relevant United Nations\r\nbodies.\r\nOf course, any mechanisms for protecting peace-keepers\r\nmust also require that parties to any conflict respect the\r\nintegrity of those personnel that have been deployed on their\r\nbehalf. Such an undertaking should, in principle, form part\r\nof the mandate for any peace-keeping operation. The recent\r\npractice of the Security Council of establishing clear\r\nmandates for peace-keeping operations at the outset of\r\ndeployment is especially welcome, but there remains an onus\r\non a host State both to explain carefully to its people the\r\nreason for the United Nations presence and also to take\r\nactive steps to ensure the safety of United Nations personnel.\r\nBut the purpose of peace-keeping or peacemaking and\r\npeace-building is not solely to deal with conflicts that have\r\nalready arisen, urgent though that task is. We must improve\r\nour capacity to prevent conflicts before they break out, and\r\nI should like to acknowledge here the importance and\r\ntimeliness of recent improvements in conflict-resolution\r\nmechanisms and the ongoing work on preventive diplomacy.\r\nI welcome very warmly the contribution made by my\r\nAustralian colleague, Senator Gareth Evans, to the debate on\r\nthis subject. He has given us much food for thought and\r\nsome helpful suggestions for concrete steps we can take to\r\nimprove our performance in this area.\r\n40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nDisarmament measures remain a key element in conflict\r\nprevention. This year, as the international community\r\nmoves towards the extension - I hope for an indefinite\r\nperiod - of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons, the Assembly will have non-proliferation as one\r\nof its major themes. In this regard, North Korea’s continued\r\nevasion of its responsibilities under that Treaty demands a\r\nfirm international response.\r\nWe welcome very strongly the restraint being shown by\r\nthe nuclear-weapon States on testing and their positive\r\nattitude towards the launching of negotiations for a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. It is not before time. New\r\nZealand has sponsored a draft resolution on comprehensive\r\ntest-bans for many years. Its purpose now is on the brink of\r\nfulfillment. The subject needs to be taken up in the\r\nConference on Disarmament. Given the importance of the\r\ntasks now on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament,\r\nmembership of the Conference must be open to all who have\r\nthe will to participate constructively.\r\nIn respect of conventional weaponry, we applaud the\r\nenhancement of controls through the commencement of the\r\nRegister of conventional-arms transfers. We now have a\r\nchemical weapons Convention in place alongside the\r\nbiological weapons Convention.\r\nIt is timely to consider what similar work can be done\r\nin respect of conventional weapons. As disarmament moves\r\nfrom the realms of Utopia into the achievable, we must lend\r\nevery effort, here in the United Nations and outside it, to\r\nensure disarmament’s more rapid progress. No sensible\r\nproposal should be discarded simply for outdated ideological\r\nreasons.\r\nThe spread of democratic institutions to every corner of\r\nthe globe is, I believe, one of the most encouraging\r\nphenomena of recent years, and the pace is astonishing. In\r\nthe space of just 24 hours last week, the Parliament of Israel\r\napproved a Declaration of Principles on Palestinian self-\r\ngovernment; the Parliament of South Africa enacted\r\nlegislation establishing the Transitional Executive Council to\r\ntake charge of that country until a democratically elected\r\nGovernment is in office; and a constitutional Government\r\ntook office in Cambodia.\r\nWe welcome these historic events and the promise they\r\nhold for a more just and prosperous existence for the peoples\r\nof those nations. As delegations will remember, the Middle\r\nEast and South Africa dominated the political agenda of the\r\nAssembly for many years. These positive developments in\r\nboth regions will give a new cast to the Assembly’s\r\ndeliberations.\r\nWe can also take heart from progress on another front\r\nof long-standing concern to the Assembly. The United\r\nNations is now three years into the International Decade for\r\nthe Eradication of Colonialism. The good news is that we\r\nare already seeing evidence that the goals and objectives of\r\nthe United Nations in this area are almost completely\r\nrealized. The number of Self-Governing Territories on the\r\nUnited Nations list is now very small, and many of these are\r\nexploring innovative ways to complete the decolonization\r\nprocess. The recent United Nations Seminar on Colonialism,\r\nheld in Papua-New Guinea in June, confirmed this trend. It\r\nalso revealed that in some cases some very small Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories do not want fundamental constitutional\r\nchange thrust upon them.\r\nNew Zealand has always been a strong advocate of the\r\nprinciple that in all cases decisions on self-determination are,\r\nof course, for the local people to make. We are comfortable\r\nwith the notion that certain Territories, such as the Tokelaus,\r\nmay finally choose to develop concepts of self-government\r\nand free association that further develop models that have\r\nalready been successfully employed for other very small\r\nformer Territories.\r\nIn that connection, and consistent with New Zealand’s\r\nprincipled approach to all matters of decolonization, I am\r\npleased to confirm that the New Zealand Government and\r\nthe people of the Tokelaus have extended an invitation to the\r\nUnited Nations to send a further visiting mission to the\r\nTokelaus early in 1994 to meet local leaders and, of course,\r\ndiscuss recent developments.\r\nDemocracy is a sure foundation for peace between\r\nnations. It is the political expression of that universal\r\nrespect for human rights to which we are all committed.\r\nThe Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action arising out of\r\nthis year’s World Conference on Human Rights gives some\r\ndirection to steps the Organization can take to strengthen the\r\nobservance of human rights.\r\nI believe we should move quickly to approve a high\r\ncommissioner for human rights. The United Nations needs\r\nan officer with a mandate to play a constructive role in\r\npreventing, monitoring and alleviating human rights abuses\r\nthroughout the world. The Centre for Human Rights should\r\nbe given the resources to match the immense task it will\r\nhave before it. There is a clear need for an enhanced\r\nprogramme of advisory services and technical assistance to\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 41\r\nhelp countries build up their national human rights\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nHuman rights is also about recognizing the rights of\r\npeoples to self-identity. In this, the International Year for\r\nthe World’s Indigenous People, I would like to support a\r\nproposal that the United Nations declare a decade for\r\nindigenous peoples. We need to build on what has been\r\nachieved, first at Rio de Janeiro and subsequently during the\r\nInternational Year world wide. This is a long-term task. It\r\nwill require a sustained and very coordinated effort.\r\nUnhappily, our task is not just to enhance the\r\nobservance of human rights. In this last decade of the\r\ntwentieth century, we seem at times to be actually moving\r\nbackwards, witnessing the abuse and deprivation of human\r\nrights on a scale that we really believed we had put a long\r\nway behind us. The suffering of millions of refugees\r\ndisplaced by conflict is beyond our comprehension but\r\ncannot and should not be beyond our compassion. This\r\ndimension is starkly evident in nearly every issue now\r\nbefore the Security Council. Last June, the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees put the\r\nfigure at 19 million people - 19 million displaced people\r\naround the world - and it continues to rise.\r\nIt is appropriate to pay a special tribute to Mrs. Ogata\r\nand her staff for the way in which they are meeting, often in\r\ndangerous and trying circumstances, the challenges which\r\nthis problem brings. New Zealand has responded to these\r\nincreased demands by making a special provision for\r\nrefugees from Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia by\r\nestablishing special programmes for particularly vulnerable\r\ngroups, such as women at risk, and by providing aid. We\r\nnow have one of the highest per capita resettlement ratios in\r\nthe world. But this is, of course, addressing the symptoms,\r\nnot the cause. The ultimate objective must be to create or\r\nrecreate conditions that allow refugees to return in safety and\r\ndignity to their own homes and homelands.\r\nNor can we neglect the need to bring to justice those\r\nwho have brought about such suffering. The establishment\r\nof a war crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is\r\ncertainly a central pillar in the international response to this\r\nparticular conflict. The full achievement of the Tribunal’s\r\nmandate is of the highest priority. At the same time, and in\r\na broader context, New Zealand also welcomes the\r\nconsideration being given to the creation of an international\r\ncriminal court. We would like to see further progress on\r\nthis issue made during this session of the Assembly.\r\nSustainable economic growth for all countries is\r\nessential for stability and peace in the world. A principal\r\ndeterminant for that is an open, healthy and international\r\ntrading system, a system that encourages closer economic\r\nrelations and strengthened North-South exchanges. There is\r\nno greater assistance developed countries can give to the\r\ndeveloping countries than to open their markets. A\r\nsatisfactory conclusion to the Uruguay Round of multilateral\r\ntrade negotiations would be of immense benefit to us all and\r\nhas been mentioned, I believe, by just about every speaker\r\non this rostrum during this debate.\r\nProgress to that end in the General Agreement on\r\nTariffs and Trade, of course, has been slow, as we know.\r\nMany deadlines have come and many deadlines have gone\r\nwithout resolution. We should not be under any illusion.\r\nCome this December, after seven years of negotiations on\r\nthe Uruguay Round, either we will have the liberalization of\r\nmultilateral trade with a benefit to all or the prospects of\r\navoiding global economic warfare will have suffered the\r\nmost serious setback. The New Zealand Government sees\r\nthe purpose of these negotiations being to lock in place\r\ntoday the politically attainable, and to build on what might\r\nbe possible tomorrow. In preparing for that, we also have\r\nto focus our attention on what is needed to ensure that all\r\ncountries are placed where they can reap the benefits of the\r\nfuture.\r\nWe still have much to follow up from the Rio\r\nConference on Environment and Development. But time is\r\nnot on our side. Environmental degradation continues to\r\npose a serious threat to the planet and its resources, and no\r\ncountry - no country - is immune from its impact. The\r\nlevels of responsibility for environmental damage may differ\r\nfrom country to country, but we must face up to their\r\nconsequences together. We must meet the objectives of\r\nAgenda 21 and the Rio Declaration. All countries should\r\nmove to ratify the climate and biodiversity Conventions, a\r\nstep that New Zealand took just recently. New Zealand will\r\ncontribute to the global environmental facility that is to fund\r\nboth of those Conventions. We have begun work to reduce\r\ncarbon dioxide emissions and are developing a\r\ncomprehensive strategy for reducing net greenhouse gas\r\nemissions. We are also making excellent progress on\r\nphasing out consumption of ozone-depleting chemicals.\r\nNew Zealand is ready to share its expertise on biological\r\ndiversity with other countries to assist them in meeting\r\nobligations under the Conventions.\r\nI suppose that one of the most useful exercises that we\r\ncan conclude here is to draw some lessons from the\r\nexperiences and views that I have set out. The most obvious\r\n42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\none to me is that, however important it is to deal with the\r\nparticularities of human aspirations for peace, respect for the\r\nindividual, economic well-being and a good, clean\r\nenvironment, one should never lose sight of the connections\r\nbetween them all. The Secretary-General has pointed out\r\nhow peace, development and democracy form a mutually\r\nreinforcing circle, and we agree. Getting the linkages right\r\ncan be as important for success as the elements of each.\r\nPeace and security are not likely to be soundly based if\r\npeople are hungry. Economic growth cannot last if the\r\nnatural resources used to create it are not conserved. People\r\nare not likely to make the effort required by economic\r\nrestructuring if the important choices are made for them.\r\nEconomic growth cannot be sustained if countries keep\r\ncoming up with new pretexts, such as environmental\r\nprotection, to justify excluding outside competition from\r\ntheir own markets.\r\nHuman aspirations and human security must be seen in\r\nthe round. That is one of the major challenges facing the\r\nmembership of this Organization. The work done by the\r\nUnited Nations in post-peace-keeping situations, I believe,\r\ndeserves renewed attention. For those countries where there\r\nis still a need to foster economic, political and social\r\ndevelopment, we should look at establishing a partnership\r\narrangement between the United Nations and the sovereign\r\nGovernment. A coordinating body comprising the\r\nGovernments and a group of friends of the Secretariat could\r\nhelp to ensure that the gains of peace-keeping are taken\r\nthrough to reconstruction. I believe that we need a new\r\ninstitutional framework to graduate problems out of the\r\nsecurity area and into a forum more able to cope with the\r\nneeds of redevelopment and reconstruction.\r\nThe second lesson is that we need to keep looking at\r\nhow well the United Nations is fitted to meet the challenges\r\nit is facing and be prepared to change it where necessary.\r\nMembership of the United Nations has continued to grow\r\nand I warmly welcome the newest Member States.\r\nMany speakers have referred to Security Council\r\nreform. The Security Council is in need of early reform.\r\nWe support a modest increase in membership and a fresh\r\nlook at the institution as a whole. The possibility of some\r\nmembers representing regional groupings for, say, a 10-year\r\nperiod is worth considering. New Zealand will continue to\r\noppose any extension of veto rights.\r\nAnother imperative is for the Council’s work methods\r\nto be improved. Wider consultation with the broader\r\nmembership of the United Nations is essential. United\r\nNations agencies are also ripe for restructuring. The General\r\nAssembly has made a good start on itself. We have\r\nstreamlined the Committees, but we also must streamline the\r\noverall workload. It is unmanageable at present.\r\nFor several years now, we have been looking hard at\r\nways to fund new demands on the Organization by making\r\ncompensating savings elsewhere. We still need to ask hard\r\nquestions about whether all that has been done traditionally\r\nstill needs to be done. I welcome the fact that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s budget proposals already envisage some major\r\nsteps in this area. He has also identified better contracting\r\nas a source of further savings.\r\nAt the end of the day, however, all that can be done to\r\nincrease efficiency and cut costs will come to naught if the\r\nfinancial commitment by Member States is lacking. New\r\nZealand pays its dues on time; most others do not. I urge\r\nthem to do so. Let us certainly go on talking about financial\r\nreform, but let us also secure the financial basis of the\r\nOrganization while we are doing so.\r\nBut what is the real dream that all of us have? I would\r\nurge all members to keep making, from year to year, real\r\nprogress towards satisfying those basic human aspirations I\r\nmentioned at the outset and to do so with a strong, well-\r\nequipped and well-focused United Nations. Specifically, I\r\nwant to see a reshaped Security Council, a more tightly\r\nfocused General Assembly, better peace-keeping practice, a\r\nSecretariat equipped to handle peace-building and partnership\r\narrangements, and financial arrangements built on efficiency\r\nand punctuality. Would that not give a point to the fiftieth\r\nanniversary celebrations that lie ahead in 1995, and would it\r\nnot make the United Nations of the next 50 years a more\r\neffective, more dynamic and exciting place to do the world’s\r\nbusiness in than the conditions of the last 50 years have\r\nallowed? The deprived of this world expect no less. The\r\nwell-off know the world is too small for the huge gap that\r\nnow exists amongst all people to remain.\r\nMr. DOSSOU (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the delegation of Benin and on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Benin, I should like to extend\r\nmy warm congratulations to Ambassador Insanally on his\r\nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at this session. His unanimous election as leader\r\nof our deliberations testifies to his abilities; it is also\r\nrepresents an honour for his country and draws attention to\r\nthe role played by Caribbean countries in the international\r\narena.\r\nI take this opportunity to extend my sincere\r\ncongratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 43\r\nably presided over the work of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-seventh session.\r\nIt is also a great pleasure and a privilege for me to pay\r\na well-deserved tribute to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, who effectively and\r\nsuccessfully heads this global Organization and who is\r\nworking intensively to restore peace and security to the\r\nvarious hotbeds of tension throughout the world.\r\nThe delegation of Benin solemnly welcomes the new\r\nStates that have joined the world community to make their\r\ncontribution to respect for the common basic values of the\r\nnew society which together, we, the people of the world, are\r\nendeavouring to build. I welcome the Czech Republic, the\r\nSlovak Republic, Eritrea, the Principality of Monaco and the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra, whose admission enhances the\r\nuniversality of this Organization.\r\nWe are meeting here, as we do each year under similar\r\ncircumstances, to consider together ways and means of\r\npromoting peace and prosperity for all our peoples.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, we\r\nhave witnessed many important events that have given the\r\ninternational community as a whole new prospects and new\r\nchallenges in its quest for peace.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the confrontation between the\r\ntwo blocs, which for so long had created political tension,\r\nhas today been replaced by the universal values of\r\ndemocracy and equality in international relations. These\r\nvalues are interdependent with economic and social\r\ndevelopment and with the security of all States.\r\nIt is also encouraging to see that renewed confidence in\r\nthe effectiveness of the United Nations in settling conflicts\r\nhas strengthened the credibility and the capacity to act of the\r\nOrganization, opening up new areas in which it is able to\r\nencourage the settlement of a vast range of problems that\r\nafflict humankind.\r\nIn just five years, the tasks of the Organization in the\r\narea of maintaining peace have increased and widened\r\nconsiderably.\r\nDespite positive developments, changes currently under\r\nway that were designed to provide for greater freedom and\r\nencourage the establishment of more just and more dynamic\r\nsocieties have unfortunately also become the source of new\r\nchallenges and even greater uncertainty in international\r\nrelations. Each day, in one place or another on our planet,\r\ncivil wars, territorial partition, ethnic confrontations and\r\ntribal or religious struggles demand the urgent intervention\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nWe can see, therefore, how difficult is the task of the\r\nOrganization, which is obliged to respect a fragile balance\r\nbetween the sovereignty of States and the duty to intervene.\r\nIn Europe, the political picture has changed\r\ndramatically in just a few years. The hopes born of the\r\ndisappearance of the Berlin Wall have been virtually dashed\r\nby another, anachronistic war in the former Yugoslavia and\r\nby the situation in some of the States that emerged from the\r\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union, thus threatening stability\r\nand security on the old continent.\r\nIn Africa, major civil wars continue to rage. These\r\nwars are responsible for the untold suffering and destruction\r\nwhich are hampering efforts at socio-economic development\r\nand recovery in our continent.\r\nAfrica needs peace and security. Without them the\r\ncourageous and far-reaching reforms undertaken at the\r\npolitical and economic levels cannot be successful.\r\nThe twenty-ninth summit of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) held in Cairo in June of this year provided us\r\nwith an opportunity to adopt a mechanism for the\r\nprevention, management and settlement of conflicts. That\r\nmechanism is an important step forward in the acceptance of\r\nthe imperative of peace, which is so essential to\r\ndevelopment. Indeed, conflict management remains a major\r\nconcern for our countries, as the massive movements of\r\nrefugees that result from conflicts distract us, to our sorrow,\r\nfrom the paramount task of development.\r\nWest Africa, which until now has been a peaceful land\r\nof asylum, welcoming refugees from the rest of the continent\r\nand even beyond, is now living through a particularly\r\ndifficult time, with an unprecedented increase in emergency\r\nsituations and in the number of refugees, which in less than\r\nfour years has risen from 20,000 to 1.2 million.\r\nHere, I would pay a tribute to the humanitarian\r\nactivities and the considerable efforts of the United Nations\r\nto settle conflicts in Africa and elsewhere in the world.\r\nBecause of the support of the United Nations, the\r\nLiberian conflict today offers encouraging prospects for a\r\npeaceful and lasting settlement. The major protagonists in\r\n44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nthe Liberian tragedy now seem disposed towards dialogue\r\nand agreement. They met in Geneva from 10 to\r\n17 July 1993, with the help of representatives of the\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization of African Unity and\r\nthe Executive Secretariat of the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) and of the Acting President\r\nof that Community, to seek ways and means of silencing the\r\nweapons of war and restoring peace to their country. Those\r\npresent at the Geneva meeting successfully prepared a\r\ncomprehensive agreement that takes account of all aspects of\r\nthe Liberian tragedy.\r\nIn Cotonou on 25 July 1993, representatives of the\r\nvarious factions and of the interim Government of Liberia\r\nsigned that peace agreement, thanks to the mediation of Mr.\r\nNicéphore Soglo, President of the Republic of Benin, and\r\nActing President of ECOWAS. Benin is pleased by the\r\nwillingness of our Liberian brothers to enter into this\r\nagreement and by their spirit of constructive and fraternal\r\ndialogue, without which nothing positive could have been\r\nachieved. Benin continues to believe that dialogue is the\r\nonly way of restoring peace to this war-torn country.\r\nWe welcome the positive results thus far achieved in\r\nthe implementation of the agreement, most notably the\r\nobservation of the cease-fire by all the warring factions and\r\nthe cessation of hostilities.\r\nIn particular, the delegation of Benin welcomes the\r\nunanimous adoption by the Security Council of resolution\r\n856 (1993), which supports the efforts of ECOWAS and\r\napproves the deployment in Liberia of an advance team of\r\n30 military observers to participate in the work of the Joint\r\nCease-fire Monitoring Committee. We also welcome\r\nresolution 866 (1993), which establishes the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).\r\nThis Mission can be made possible only by a\r\nmobilization of the international community to support the\r\nefforts of ECOWAS by, inter alia, contributing to the\r\nspecial trust fund, which would facilitate the dispatch of\r\nreinforcements to ECOMOG by the African States and help\r\nprovide for the upkeep of the contingents made available to\r\nECOMOG by the participating States, as well as by helping\r\nin carrying out the work of removing mines, providing\r\nhumanitarian and developmental assistance and promoting\r\nthe healthy evolution of the electoral process.\r\nThe three signatories of the 25 July 1993 peace\r\nagreement met in Cotonou from 15 to 18 August 1993 to set\r\nup the Council of State, the transitional executive body. The\r\n25 July peace agreement promises finally to put an end to\r\nthe very long, devastating war in Liberia.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to make an appeal to\r\nall the parties who signed that agreement, urging them to\r\ncontinue to abide by the commitments entered into during\r\nthe Cotonou talks and to work with ECOWAS and the\r\nUnited Nations for the proper and swift implementation of\r\nthose commitments, in order to put an end to the suffering\r\nof the Liberian people and ensure that the national\r\nreconciliation process will proceed to its successful\r\ncompletion.\r\nAlong the lines of the solution under way in Liberia,\r\nwe should work to ensure that peace returns to Somalia,\r\nAngola, the Sudan and Mozambique.\r\nIn Angola, for example, despite the great hopes and\r\nexpectations aroused by the agreements reached in Estoril,\r\nPortugal, we are seriously disturbed and deeply saddened by\r\nthe resumption of hostilities following the refusal of UNITA\r\nto recognize the results of the free elections of 29 and\r\n30 September 1992.\r\nBenin welcomes the change in the position taken by the\r\nUnited States Government, which has now granted\r\ndiplomatic recognition to the legal Government of Angola.\r\nThis action by the Clinton Administration strengthens the\r\nposition of the international community in support of the\r\nverdict of the ballot box rather than the compulsion of the\r\ngun.\r\nIn South Africa, developments are encouraging. The\r\nmultipartite talks made it possible to reach an agreement on,\r\ninter alia, the establishment of a transitional executive\r\ncouncil and the holding of the first democratic and\r\nnon-racial elections in the history of South Africa, scheduled\r\nfor 27 April 1994.\r\nThe Government of Benin supports the courageous and\r\nresponsible appeal by the Chairman of the African National\r\nCongress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, before the Special\r\nCommittee against Apartheid in this prestigious Hall of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 24 September 1993. He invited the\r\ninternational community to lift all economic sanctions\r\nagainst South Africa, except for the arms embargo. Given\r\nthe positive development that will lead this country, which\r\nis undergoing a process of reform, to implement the\r\nprinciple of \"one man, one vote\", the time has come for all\r\nMembers of our universal Organization to support the\r\npeaceful transformation of South Africa.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 45\r\nBenin wishes to see the African continent free itself of\r\nall fratricidal and internal wars, of all conflicts that impede\r\nits development. It is my firm hope that the logic of war\r\nwill now progressively yield to the logic of peace and\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nTurning to the Middle East, 26 years after Israel’s\r\noccupation of the Arab territories, Benin cannot but greet\r\nwith joy the historic agreement between the Israeli\r\nGovernment and the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\ngranting autonomy to Gaza and Jericho.\r\nThat agreement marks the beginning of a just and\r\nlasting peace that will allow every State in the region,\r\nincluding Palestine and Israel, to live within secure and\r\ninternationally recognized borders guaranteed by the\r\ninternational community. Our duty is thus to encourage the\r\ntwo essential parties, as well as all parties involved, to\r\nundertake or to continue the dialogue necessary for a\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East.\r\nIn the Persian Gulf region the full restoration of the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait helped to\r\nreaffirm the fundamental principles governing inter-State\r\nrelations. In this connection we sincerely hope that Security\r\nCouncil resolution 833 (1993), on the demarcation of the\r\ninternational border between Iraq and Kuwait, will be\r\nrespected by all States. Pending issues such as that of the\r\nKuwaiti prisoners of war must be settled so as to open the\r\nway to fraternity, cooperation and solidarity in that\r\nsubregion.\r\nThe atmosphere of relaxation of tension which began\r\nwith the end of the cold war and which has made possible\r\na new spirit of consensus, inter alia in the Security Council,\r\nis still rather uncertain for much remains to be done to\r\nconsolidate peace.\r\nWe must recognize today that the idea of peace can no\r\nlonger be based on a build-up of weapons; it must be based,\r\nrather, on concerted efforts on their reduction and complete\r\nelimination. The balance of terror is now yielding to a\r\nmeeting of the minds, the hearts and the actions of man.\r\nThat is why the signing of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\r\non Their Destruction, in Paris on 13-15 January 1993, not\r\nonly helps to strengthen international peace and security but\r\nalso offers prospects for international cooperation in the area\r\nof using the chemicals industry for peaceful purposes.\r\nBenin, which is dedicated to peace and economic and\r\nsocial progress, urges the international community to refrain\r\nfrom any military use of science so that science can be\r\ndevoted to development, and international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe decision by Russia, the United States of America,\r\nthe United Kingdom and France to extend their moratorium\r\non nuclear testing until September 1994 proves that the\r\nGovernments of those nuclear Powers are increasingly\r\ninterested in measures that will make it possible to use\r\nscientific and technical developments exclusively for\r\npeaceful purposes.\r\nMy country joins the rest of the international\r\ncommunity in congratulating the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea on the reversal of its decision to\r\nwithdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), for that withdrawal from the\r\nTreaty would only have weakened it, given that its strength\r\nlies in its universality.\r\nThe determination shown by Member States to move\r\ntowards the solution of regional conflicts and the new sense\r\nof urgency over new threats to the well-being of the planet\r\ncreate a historic opportunity for us to tackle the economic\r\nproblems facing all of our countries.\r\nIndeed, this forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly is taking place against a background of general\r\neconomic crisis. In the new economic order which is\r\ncharacterized by increased trade between three dominant\r\ngroups - Western Europe, North America and the Pacific-\r\nAsia zone - Africa is virtually left out.\r\nThe developed North seems to have less and less need\r\nof Africa’s products and Africa for its part no longer has the\r\nmeans to buy the goods and services of the North. What is\r\nmore, the international community does not seem very\r\nanxious to find a better way of dealing with the African\r\ncountries’ debt burden.\r\nThis situation cannot but lead to a slowing down in\r\ntrade on the world market and directly affect African\r\neconomies which are already suffering.\r\nIn these circumstances our survival necessarily requires\r\nsustained regional integration so that we can be in a better\r\nposition to deal with the vicissitudes of the international\r\neconomic environment and take up the challenge of how to\r\ndevelop our own continent.\r\n46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nIn his \"An Agenda for Peace\" the Secretary-General\r\nemphasized the role of regional organizations in establishing\r\npeace and preventive diplomacy. This role naturally extends\r\nto development too. We cannot overemphasize the\r\nimportance of integration for development.\r\nIn the case of Africa such integration is a means of\r\nencouraging trade, investment, and research and development\r\ncooperation among African countries.\r\nThat is why the Heads of State or Government of the\r\nmembers of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS), meeting in Cotonou from 22 to\r\n24 July 1993, adopted and signed a revised Treaty of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States and reaffirmed\r\ntheir determination to bring a new dynamism to the process\r\nof regional integration.\r\nIf the development of Africa is primarily the\r\nresponsibility of the Africans themselves, it is no less\r\nimportant for the international community to recognize the\r\nprinciple of shared responsibility and full partnership with\r\nAfrica.\r\nIn this connection we should note that the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s is not living up to all\r\nthe hopes that the African countries placed in it. It is\r\nnecessary further to strengthen national capacities and to\r\ncreate a climate that is favourable to development.\r\nWhile Benin welcomes the study on the need and the\r\nfeasibility of the establishment of a fund to diversify African\r\ncommodities, we strongly hope that bolder action will be\r\ntaken with a view to implementing the new programme and\r\nensuring the input of the major financial contributions which\r\nare necessary for the establishment of the fund in 1994.\r\nHence we must increase the quality and the quantity of\r\nassistance to Africa.\r\nIn this spirit Benin will in a few days be participating\r\nin the Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment. This Conference, to be held against the\r\nbackdrop of the new world economic and political order of\r\nthe post-cold-war era, will provide the international\r\ncommunity with a new framework for discussing how to\r\nreaffirm the question of Africa’s economic development as\r\none of the major concerns of the world today.\r\nOur hope, widely shared by African countries, is that\r\nthe Conference, apart from adopting a declaration, will\r\nactually lead to specific actions and commitments in support\r\nof Africa.\r\nThe African countries also hope that the Tokyo\r\nDeclaration of 9 July 1993 of the Group of Seven\r\nindustrialized countries - which was designed to replace the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank\r\nStructural Adjustment Programme with another mechanism\r\nthat would be better adapted to the conditions and realities\r\nof developing countries - will soon take effect.\r\nIf this new mechanism is to have some hope of\r\nsucceeding, it will have to be drawn up following\r\nconsultations with the countries that are actually\r\nexperiencing the harsh social consequences of the Structural\r\nAdjustment Programme.\r\nIf we are to win this wager for development, to which\r\nAfrica aspires, we have to involve women and children, who\r\nrepresent the majority of the populations of our countries,\r\nand so, above all, we have to educate and train young people\r\nand adults.\r\nIn this connection, the Government of the Republic of\r\nBenin is actively preparing for the International Year of the\r\nFamily in 1994. We shall also be participating with great\r\ninterest in the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Cairo from 5 to\r\n13 September 1994. In addition, we wish to make a real\r\ncontribution to the preparatory work for the World\r\nConference on Women, which will be held in Beijing in\r\n1995.\r\nThe fact that these various conferences are to be held\r\nshows that matters relating to social development are\r\neliciting unprecedented interest in the world. This can also\r\nbe seen from the decision to convene a World Summit for\r\nSocial Development in 1995. This renewal of interest is\r\nmotivated by the profound changes in the social and political\r\nsituation in the world, and the shifting of priorities at the\r\nState level.\r\nDemocracy cannot become stronger unless there is at\r\nleast a minimum level of prosperity for peoples. One\r\nobstacle to this strengthening of democracy and thus the full\r\ndevelopment of human rights is poverty, the poverty in\r\nwhich the majority of our populations live.\r\nThe right to development has been ignored for too long.\r\nIt must now be regarded as a priority right, a sacred right.\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 47\r\nThis right to development is the right to dignity, to personal\r\ndevelopment, and is not compatible with the subhuman\r\nstatus afflicting millions of human beings, particularly in\r\nAfrica, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nThe right to development is a human right and a\r\nnational right, and that is why we welcome the conclusions\r\nof the World Conference on Human Rights, which was held\r\nin Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993. That Conference\r\ncertainly marked the beginning of a new era which, we trust,\r\nwill witness the gradual elimination of the current\r\ninternational economic order, in which two thirds of\r\nmankind cannot meet their basic needs and in which\r\n600 million human beings are living in almost absolute\r\npoverty. The elimination of such poverty is one of the basic\r\nobjectives of Agenda 21. The establishment of an\r\nInternational Day for the Eradication of Poverty, the first of\r\nwhich will be celebrated on 17 October next, is one step in\r\nthis direction.\r\nWe can never say often enough that the major\r\necological problems facing our countries today have a\r\nplanetary dimension that requires a world-wide approach.\r\nThis is why the United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development, held in Rio in June 1992, made\r\nsustainable development one of the major concerns of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThat Conference marked a turning-point in the way that\r\nwe look at our future. It must now be approached in an\r\nintegrated manner as we work on our development policies.\r\nAgenda 21, the basic document that emerged from that\r\nConference, is an enormous programme of action for the late\r\ntwentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It requires\r\nGovernments to adopt national strategies focused on\r\nsustainable development, in close cooperation with the\r\nprivate and public sectors.\r\nHere I am happy to draw attention to the major\r\nimportance my country attaches to follow-up of the decisions\r\nand recommendations of Rio. Benin welcomes the\r\nestablishment of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, which held its first session here in New York\r\nfrom 14 to 25 June 1993, and we welcome the work of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the elaboration\r\nof an international convention to combat desertification in\r\nthose countries experiencing serious drought and/or\r\ndesertification, particularly in Africa. That Committee has\r\nalready met, from 24 May to 3 June 1993 in Nairobi and\r\nfrom 13 to 24 September 1993 in Geneva.\r\nPursuant to the Rio recommendations, on 9 to\r\n13 August 1993 Benin held a national seminar on follow-up\r\nstrategies to implement the results of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, including\r\nconsideration of chapter 12 of Agenda 21, on how to combat\r\ndesertification and the impact of drought. The seminar was\r\nheld at a time when the international community and the\r\ndevelopment partners of the third world countries were fully\r\ninvolved in thinking about what strategies should be used to\r\nmake this concept of sustainable development operational.\r\nThis seminar was proof of the political will of the\r\nGovernment of Benin to abide by the commitments we\r\nentered into at Rio.\r\nThe Cotonou seminar recommended, inter alia, the\r\nestablishment of a national commission on sustainable\r\ndevelopment. A drafting committee for a national Agenda\r\n21, the major guidelines for which were decided on by the\r\nseminar, has been set up. It should finish its work by the\r\nend of this year.\r\nIn two years, we shall be celebrating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\r\nThe years that have passed since 1945 have been\r\nmarked by ongoing, fundamental change and by a\r\nconsiderable increase in the membership of the Organization\r\nas well as by a significant widening of the Organization’s\r\narea of activity.\r\nIt is thus obvious that the Organization needs to be\r\nrestructured to meet our world’s current requirements. This\r\nis why Benin supports the efforts under way to restructure\r\nand revitalize the United Nations in its economic and social\r\nsectors and related areas.\r\nIn the view of the delegation of Benin, the reform\r\nshould be designed to ensure better coordination of the\r\nactivities of the United Nations and wiser utilization of its\r\nhuman and financial resources.\r\nBenin, while still open to dialogue in negotiations,\r\nendorses the view of the Group of 77, particularly on the\r\nquestion of how to allocate seats on the governing bodies of\r\nbodies such as the United Nations Development Programme,\r\nthe United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund.\r\nIn the political area, my country is willing to consider\r\nall proposals that take account of the concerns and interests\r\nof all the various actors, large and small, in the international\r\npolitical arena at the end of this second millennium.\r\n48 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nReform of the Security Council is a matter of particular\r\nimportance to all Member States. Benin will follow closely\r\nany proposal for reform that might strengthen the\r\neffectiveness of the Council and avoid transforming it into\r\na forum for sterile debate or logjams or into an instrument\r\nthat benefits only a privileged few.\r\nBefore I conclude my statement, I should like to recall\r\nthat if we wish to approach the next millennium in\r\ntranquillity, if we wish to draw satisfaction from the efforts\r\nmade so far along the tortuous and difficult path towards\r\ndevelopment, we must do everything possible to give more\r\nsustained attention to the principle of world-wide partnership\r\nand the duty to show solidarity which is necessarily implied\r\nby the new international order that now governs the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIt is Benin’s wish that mankind, when it draws up its\r\nfirst balance sheet of this new era, should see a drop in the\r\nnumber of ills that continue to undermine the twentieth\r\ncentury, namely poverty, famine, endemic diseases such as\r\nmalaria, the AIDS pandemic and its devastating human,\r\nsocial and economic consequences, illiteracy, environmental\r\ndegradation, underdevelopment, and all those other ills that\r\nbeset us.\r\nIn an increasingly interdependent world, and faced with\r\nthis challenge, nations must agree to yield part - only part -\r\nof their national sovereignty to our universal human values,\r\nand to show greater determination to coexist despite cultural,\r\npolitical, social and economic differences. Only in that way\r\ncan the world of the twenty-first century be a more\r\nhospitable one for people, wherever they may live and\r\nwhoever they may be.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe general debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply. I remind members\r\nthat statements in the exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and five\r\nminutes for the second intervention, and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. ANSARI (India): I wish, under rule 73 of the rules\r\nof procedure, to refer to the statement made earlier today by\r\nthe representative of Pakistan.\r\nAll the water in the East River cannot wash off the\r\nstains of falsehood, prejudice and perversion with which the\r\nForeign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan defaced\r\nthis lofty forum. His eloquence is matched only by his\r\nsophistry, and the two together constitute an impressive\r\nexercise in high-pitched salesmanship of a product whose\r\nshelf-life is ending, if it has not ended.\r\nThe representative of Pakistan sought to assume an air\r\nof injured innocence. He would have us believe that he has\r\nbeen forced into combat without even a sword in his hand.\r\nThe truth, however, is that he does not stand in need of a\r\nsword. He is instead making use of every weapon available\r\nin the arsenal of modern-day terrorism. His Government’s\r\nrole in recruiting, training, funding and arming terrorists and\r\nabetting their infiltration into the Indian states of Punjab and\r\nJammu and Kashmir is well known to Governments, the\r\ninternational media and human rights organizations.\r\nVery recently a report by Asia Watch gave ample facts\r\nand figures to substantiate what it called \"the Pakistan\r\nconduit\" being used by these terrorists. The \"conduit\" is not\r\nfor moral support, as is claimed so innocently by Pakistan.\r\nIt is instead a well established channel for injecting deadly\r\nhardware into the territory of India. Clinching evidence of\r\nthis was provided by the United States Department of State\r\nreport on global terrorism for the year 1991, and by a\r\nDepartment of State spokesman on 8 January 1993.\r\nMatters have deteriorated to such an extent that the\r\nUnited States Government considered in all seriousness\r\ndeclaring Pakistan a State sponsor of terrorism. This is\r\nevident from an extract from a letter dated 2 August 1993\r\nwhich the State Department wrote to the Chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Foreign Affairs of the United States House of\r\nRepresentatives, which reads as follows:\r\n\"If there is any subsequent resurgence of official\r\nsupport for those who commit terrorist acts against\r\nIndia, either directly or through private groups, the\r\nSecretary of State will not hesitate to name Pakistan a\r\nState sponsor of terrorism.\r\n\"...\r\n\"In any case, the Secretary of State will review this\r\nissue again not later than December this year\".\r\nPakistan’s commitment to the cause of promoting\r\nterrorism does not stop at this. It has gone further, to ensure\r\nthat this terrorism is \"sustainable\". It has done so by\r\nestablishing a deep nexus between terrorism and the trade in\r\nnarcotic drugs. The present caretaker Government of\r\nPakistan published only the other day a list of some of their\r\nmore prominent narcotics barons. It reads like a \"Who’s\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 49\r\nWho\" of that noble land. If further evidence is needed of\r\nthe Pakistani hand, it is readily available in countries such as\r\nEgypt, Tunisia and Algeria, where Pakistani-trained terrorists\r\nof the Peshawar school have been wreaking havoc.\r\nIt would thus seem that the crocodile tears the Foreign\r\nMinister of Pakistan has shed before this Assembly are\r\nreally in support of his extraordinary plea that world opinion\r\nshould accept Pakistan’s actions as the principal promoter of\r\nnarco-terrorism in the world. From this unacceptable\r\npremise the Government of Pakistan wishes to argue that it\r\nshould not only be allowed a free hand to violate with\r\nimpunity the basic human rights of ordinary citizens, of men,\r\nwomen and children, but should also be proclaimed the\r\nprotector of the human rights of the very terrorists who are\r\nviolating every norm of civilized existence.\r\nThe verdict of the jury on this strange plea is clear and\r\nunambiguous. It is incorporated into paragraph 17 of the\r\nVienna Declaration adopted after the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights in June this year. The words of that\r\nparagraph are worth recalling:\r\n\"The acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all\r\nits forms and manifestations as well as linkage in some\r\ncountries to drug trafficking are activities aimed at the\r\ndestruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and\r\ndemocracy, threatening territorial integrity, security of\r\nStates and destabilizing legitimately constituted\r\nGovernments. The international community should take\r\nthe necessary steps to enhance cooperation to prevent\r\nand combat terrorism.\" (A/CONF.157/23, para. 17)\r\nThe Foreign Minister of Pakistan also sought to regale\r\nus today by replaying an old, worn-out gramophone record\r\non the question of self-determination. It would be charitable\r\nto characterize his remarks as half-truths. In reality,\r\nhowever, they cloak a nefarious design aimed at the\r\nterritorial integrity of India. He conveniently ignores the\r\nfact that the debate on the concept of self-determination was\r\nsettled in the United Nations long ago. The concept itself\r\nrelates to people under colonial or alien domination or\r\nforeign occupation. It specifically does not permit action\r\nwhich would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the\r\nterritorial integrity or political unity of States. This is\r\nspelled out conclusively and unambiguously in paragraph 2\r\nof the Vienna Declaration I cited earlier.\r\nThe state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of\r\nIndia. The validity of its accession to India, both legally and\r\nthrough the popular will, is uncontestable. Rather, it is\r\nPakistan that is the aggressor and is to this day in unlawful\r\noccupation of a part of Jammu and Kashmir. The only issue\r\nthat remains to be resolved, therefore, is the vacation by\r\nPakistan of that aggression.\r\nIt is a matter of history that in the past 46 years\r\nPakistan has committed aggression against India on three\r\ndifferent occasions. After each setback it committed itself\r\nto solemn agreements, multilaterally or bilaterally. The\r\ncommitments undertaken therein were forsaken soon\r\nthereafter. The excuse in each case was a yearning for\r\nsomething not legally Pakistan’s, the justification always\r\npegged to a nebulous principle that it never practised in\r\nregard to its own people in any part of its own territory.\r\nThe Foreign Minister spoke of the sanctity of\r\ninternational agreements; he chose not to mention the Simla\r\nAgreement signed between our two countries in 1972, which\r\nhas provided the framework for the conduct of bilateral\r\nrelations. In that agreement, both countries undertook not to\r\ninterfere in each other’s internal affairs, to prevent hostile\r\npropaganda, and also to prevent the organization, assistance\r\nor encouragement of any acts detrimental to the maintenance\r\nof peace and harmonious relations. Both countries further\r\nundertook to resolve their differences by peaceful means,\r\nthrough bilateral negotiations.\r\nInstead of implementing these provisions, the\r\nGovernment of Pakistan decided, around the year 1984, to\r\nconduct a proxy war against my country through the\r\norganization of large-scale terrorism in the border states of\r\nPunjab and Jammu and Kashmir. A report published on\r\n1 February 1993 by the Republican Research Committee of\r\nthe United States House of Representatives traces in graphic\r\ndetail the manner in which the Pakistan Government\r\nagencies have involved themselves in the training of\r\nterrorists and their infiltration into India.\r\nIndia is thus the principal victim of these criminals;\r\nhowever, it is not the only one. A report in The New York\r\nTimes on 11 August 1993 by its correspondent in Peshawar\r\nattributes to the concerned officials of the United States the\r\nview that\r\n\"some of the men, and much of the inspiration, for the\r\nbombing of the World Trade Center in New York in\r\nFebruary and for a second bombing conspiracy ... in\r\nNew York in June\" (\"Where Arab Militants Train and\r\nWait\", The New York Times, 11 August 1993, p. A8)\r\ncame from Peshawar. The global dimensions of the matter\r\nare thus evident.\r\n50 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\r\nThis, then, is the record. It speaks for itself. The\r\nconclusion is inescapable that such an approach to relations\r\nwith a neighbouring country is contrary to norms of civilized\r\nbehaviour, self-defeating and certainly not conducive to\r\ncommon well-being.\r\nIndia, on its part, wishes well to Pakistan and its\r\npeople. Our two peoples are linked by ties of blood, history\r\nand culture and must take into account the economic\r\nimperatives of a common region. The people and the\r\nGovernment of India extend once again the hand of\r\nfriendship to the people and Government of Pakistan, in the\r\nexpectation that they will see fit to make a new beginning\r\nand give shape to the vision of a great Indian poet,\r\nMohammad Iqbal, whom Pakistan regards as its national\r\npoet. I translate the couplet,\r\n\"Come, let us lift the veil of otherness, bring together\r\nestranged ones,\r\nErase the signs of strangeness\".\r\nMr. AKRAM (Pakistan): Let me respond to this\r\nspewing of hatred which we have just heard from the\r\ndistinguished representative of India. Not only has he\r\nrobbed the people of Kashmir of their land, now he also\r\nwishes to rob Pakistan of its national poet.\r\nJammu and Kashmir is not an integral part of India.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 47 (1948), notes the desire of\r\nIndia and Pakistan that \"the question of the accession of\r\nJammu and Kashmir to India or Pakistan should be decided\r\nthrough the democratic method of a free and impartial\r\nplebiscite\" (fourth preambular paragraph).\r\nThis call for a plebiscite was reiterated in Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 91 (1951) and 122 (1957), among others,\r\nand resolutions of the United Nations Commission on India\r\nand Pakistan, specifically its resolutions of 13 August 1948\r\nand 5 January 1949. India has refused to implement these\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe United Nations maps - the official documents of\r\nthe United Nations - all indicate that Jammu and Kashmir is\r\ndisputed territory. Kashmir is on the agenda of the Security\r\nCouncil. The Secretary-General’s latest report mentions\r\nJammu and Kashmir as a question that has to be resolved\r\nbetween India and Pakistan. The oldest United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operation, the United Nations Military\r\nObserver Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), has\r\nbeen stationed on the line of control in Jammu and Kashmir\r\nsince 1949. So much for Kashmir being an integral part of\r\nIndia.\r\nThe Simla Agreement did not change the status of\r\nKashmir. The Simla Agreement called for a final settlement\r\nof Jammu and Kashmir through bilateral negotiations or any\r\nother means agreed between the parties. Pakistan has sought\r\nto pursue bilateral negotiations with India. We wrote to the\r\nPrime Minister of India in 1992 at the level of our Prime\r\nMinister. The response was to shut the door in our face.\r\nIndia has refused to discuss Kashmir in bilateral\r\nnegotiations.\r\nThe distinguished representative of India has said that\r\nthe self-determination in Kashmir would erode the territorial\r\nintegrity of India. Territorial integrity applies only to\r\nterritory that is part of States, not to territories which are\r\ndisputed, territories whose status has not been determined.\r\nIndia has been in colonial occupation of Kashmir since 1947.\r\nIt deserves to be treated as a colonial Power. A people\r\nstruggling against colonial occupation for their right to self-\r\ndetermination is entitled to struggle by all means possible.\r\nIndia has attempted to tarnish the Kashmiri struggle by\r\ndepicting it as terrorism. Pakistan condemns terrorism.\r\nTerrorism implies senseless violence against innocent people.\r\nBut when a people is subjected to foreign occupation, when\r\nits homes are invaded, its sons are shot and its women are\r\nraped, does it not have the right to take up arms in\r\nself-defence? As one Kashmiri businessman is quoted by\r\nThe Los Angeles Times of 29 August,\r\n\"Now it is a question of survival. Now they go into\r\nour homes and shoot our children. ... I am a\r\ngrandfather, and sometimes I feel I must pick up a\r\ngun.\"\r\nIf the Kashmiris are terrorists, then so were all those\r\nbrave sons and daughters who struggled against colonialism\r\nby all means at their disposal and won freedom for the vast\r\nmajority of the States represented in this Hall tonight. If the\r\nKashmiris are terrorists, then most of the States represented\r\nhere are the products of terrorism.\r\nThe recent human-rights Conference in Vienna took\r\nspecial note of the particular situation of peoples under\r\ncolonial and other forms of alien domination or foreign\r\noccupation, and recognized their right to take any legitimate\r\naction, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nto realize their inalienable right to self-determination.\r\nIndia’s campaign in Kashmir constitutes State terrorism.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Summit in Jakarta described the\r\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 51\r\nsuppression of a people’s struggle for self-determination as\r\nthe worst form of terrorism, and what it means to the\r\nKashmiris is torture. I quote a report of the International\r\nFederation of Lawyers for Human Rights:\r\n\"People, mainly young men, are tortured in Kashmir\r\nevery day. ... there is exhaustive evidence gathered by\r\nthe local human-rights workers, lawyers and doctors to\r\nsupport this assertion ... The methods employed are\r\nbarbaric, inhuman and unimaginably vicious. Detainees\r\nare beaten with rods or lathis; they are whipped with\r\nflexible cable; they are subjected to electric shock\r\ntreatment ...\".\r\nI shall not go any further; it is too beastly to be recounted in\r\nthis forum.\r\nAmnesty International: \"Torture is practised\r\nsystematically in Jammu and Kashmir.\"\r\nRape: this afternoon we referred to Kunan Poshpora.\r\nOn 10 October 1992 the village of Chak Saidapara was the\r\nsite of another mass rape by the Indian army. The Asia\r\nWatch report says that as the conflict in Kashmir enters its\r\nfourth year, central and state authorities have done little to\r\nstop the widespread practice of rape by Indian security\r\nforces. Arson has been a weapon in India’s counter-\r\ninsurgency strategy in Kashmir since 1990.\r\nMassacre: Sopura, 6 January 1993. Batekote,\r\n1 October 1992. Nasrullahpora, 13 July 1992. The list is\r\nendless.\r\nThe representative of India has chosen to speak of\r\nPakistan in terms that have been borrowed from a lexicon\r\nthat one should not use against one’s neighbour. Let me\r\nremind him that in Pakistan we have a functioning\r\ndemocracy. No part of Pakistan is under emergency rule,\r\nlike Kashmir. Unlike India, we do not have pogroms in\r\nPakistan. One hundred thousand Muslims have perished in\r\nacts of religious frenzy and communal violence in India\r\nsince 1947. In Pakistan we not only profess democracy, we\r\nalso practice it. We do not, like India, pretend to be perfect.\r\nBut we are certainly better than India, a country which is\r\nfast emerging as the sick man of Asia, riven by internal\r\ndissensions, divided into castes, classes and nationalities,\r\nsurging with irrational and murderous forces of Hindu\r\nfundamentalism, ruled by indecision and ambiguity, prone to\r\nbullying its neighbours and with a proclivity to the use of\r\nforce; a country which has engaged in 17 different wars\r\nsince its independence, the highest number for any State\r\nrepresented in this Hall.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I remind members that\r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to five\r\nminutes for the second intervention.\r\nI now call on the representative of India.\r\nMr. ANSARI (India): We are constrained to speak a\r\nsecond time.\r\nThe representative of Pakistan has added nothing either\r\nto the knowledge or to the perception of this Assembly. His\r\nremarks call to mind another couplet of the poet Iqbal, who,\r\nincidentally, was born an Indian and died an Indian: \"He\r\nparticipates not in serious quest, but opts eagerly for blind\r\nemulation\". My delegation considers it unnecessary to add\r\nto this very apt description.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9:30 p.m.\r\n"
