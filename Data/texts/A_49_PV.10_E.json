(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mircea Ion Snegur, President of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova.\r\nMr. Mircea Ion Snegur, President of the Republic of\r\nMoldova, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova, His Excellency Mr. Mircea Ion\r\nSnegur, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Snegur (spoke in Moldovan; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Allow me at the outset, Sir,\r\nto extend to you my cordial and sincere congratulations on\r\nthe occasion of your election as President of the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that your\r\ncompetence and active cooperation with Member States will\r\npave the way for a successful and fruitful session.\r\nAt the same time, I should like to express my deep\r\ngratitude to His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally for the\r\noutstanding work accomplished in his capacity as President\r\nof the previous session.\r\nI should also like to express sentiments of our\r\nutmost consideration to His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, whose activities in redefining the role of\r\nthis prestigious Organization in this changing world enjoy\r\nthe appreciation and support of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nI am honoured to represent the Republic of Moldova\r\nfor the second time at this rostrum. Nearly three years\r\nago, in March 1992, I expressed gratitude to Member\r\nStates for their considerable support extended to my\r\ncountry by recognizing it at the international level as an\r\nindependent State and by accepting it into the large\r\nfamily of the United Nations.\r\nLooking back over these years, I should like to note\r\nthat the Republic of Moldova gained its independence in\r\na complex political context in which the aspirations for\r\nfreedom and democracy of nations led to the collapse of\r\ntotalitarian regimes and the emergence of new States.\r\nUnfortunately, those positive changes were followed\r\nby negative tendencies, such as threats to subregional and\r\nregional security. Moreover, we are witnessing the\r\nreappearance and aggravation of some older problems\r\nconnected to national minorities, territorial disputes, the\r\npresence of foreign military troops on the territory of new\r\nindependent States, the intensification of some separatist\r\ntendencies, often inspired and directed from abroad, and\r\nso on.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the state of affairs is\r\nmore complex than we could imagine. The euphoria that\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nfollowed the events in Eastern Europe and on the territory\r\nof the former Soviet Union generated in some the opinion\r\nthat the two main objectives - democratization of society\r\nand building a market-oriented economy, both compulsory\r\nfor the institutional reintegration of new States into the\r\ndemocratic world - would not face serious obstacles. Now,\r\nhowever, we find that there is a desynchronization and even\r\na time disparity between those two objectives. I would say\r\nthat that disparity is even more evident in the new\r\nindependent States that emerged as a result of the collapse\r\nof the former Soviet Union. In this sense, the Republic of\r\nMoldova is no exception.\r\nThe situation requires a larger conceptual and practical\r\neffort to correct such desynchronizations. It is obvious that\r\nthe United Nations cannot remain indifferent to the\r\ndifficulties that confront the countries in transition. In this\r\nconnection, we consider that the Secretary-General’s\r\nintention to draw up an agenda for development is\r\nparticularly opportune, and we welcome it. In our opinion\r\nthe assistance granted by the United Nations to young\r\nStates should be provided on the basis of the concrete\r\nconditions prevailing in every specific country and the\r\nprogrammes being elaborated in each.\r\nLocated at the intersection of the geopolitical interests\r\nof some great Powers, Moldova was incorporated into a\r\nState and political entity in which democratic values were\r\nmeaningless. The experience of Moldova is different from\r\nthat of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, where\r\nthe communist \"freezer\" functioned for only four decades\r\nand something was preserved from the previous democratic\r\ndevelopment. That is why we had to begin the process of\r\ndemocratization and market transition almost from the very\r\nbeginning. The deepening of the economic crisis can be\r\nexplained to a large extent by the fact that we do not have\r\nat our disposal sufficient financial and energy resources or\r\nthe raw materials necessary to support these reforms.\r\nIn addition, our country’s potential was affected this\r\nyear by a natural disaster of which the international\r\ncommunity has already been informed. We suffered human\r\nlosses and considerable material damage, and we had to\r\nmobilize every effort and all resources to subdue the\r\nelements and overcome their consequences. Our voice was\r\nheard by the international community. I should like to\r\nexpress my sincere gratitude to the international\r\norganizations and countries that granted humanitarian\r\nassistance to the Republic of Moldova and my sincere\r\ngratitude to the Members of the United Nations for their\r\nunderstanding and sympathy, which they manifested by\r\nadopting the resolution (48/266) entitled \"Emergency\r\nassistance to the Republic of Moldova\" during the forty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nOver the three years that have elapsed since the\r\nproclamation of the independence of the Republic of\r\nMoldova, on 27 August 1991, our decision to develop\r\ndemocracy and a State of law with a market economy has\r\nremained firm, in spite of transitional difficulties. This\r\nfirm decision is being realized through our efforts to\r\ncreate the necessary legislative premises for promoting\r\nreforms, including privatization, for transforming the\r\neconomy to one based on market relations and for\r\nensuring respect for fundamental human rights and\r\nfreedoms.\r\nThe recent parliamentary elections held on a multi-\r\nparty basis were free and fair, and this was confirmed by\r\ninternational observers. Another significant event was the\r\nadoption of the Constitution, which paves the way for the\r\nreal independence and democracy chosen by the people of\r\nthe Republic of Moldova.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova has ratified a series of\r\nimportant international Conventions on human rights. We\r\nhave consequently undertaken new commitments to\r\nchange the internal juridical framework in accordance\r\nwith international standards. Measures have been taken\r\nto guarantee the rights of the national minorities, some of\r\nwhich were on the edge of losing their identity during the\r\nSoviet regime. Many provisions of Moldovan legislation\r\nare aimed at protecting the right to retain, develop and\r\nutilize the language spoken on the territory of the country.\r\nUnder the new Constitution, special forms of autonomy\r\nmay be granted to some human settlements in the east\r\nand south of the Republic of Moldova in accordance with\r\nspecial juridical statutes adopted under the constitutional\r\nlaws. For example, a draft for such a statute for the\r\nsouthern region is being examined in the Parliament.\r\nWe consider that the good intentions of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Moldova and its concrete\r\nand positive actions represent essential premises for the\r\nelimination of sources of tension. It is our strong belief\r\nthat they can be eliminated, and with less controversy, not\r\nthrough the use of force but in a peaceful way through\r\nnegotiation and dialogue; as an old saying teaches us: \"It\r\nis better to have a year of negotiations than a day of\r\nwar\". This is true, since any armed conflict provokes\r\nhuman and material losses.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova is and will remain fully\r\ncommitted to constructive negotiations, on the condition,\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nof course, that all the parties involved demonstrate political\r\nwill and common sense.\r\nAt the same time we cannot ignore the fact that in\r\nspite of reasonable compromises made by Chisinau,\r\ntendencies of separatism still exist in eastern regions, and\r\nhuman rights continue to be flagrantly violated. For\r\nexample, despite the fact that the Moldovan authorities and\r\nseveral international organizations, including the United\r\nNations, have expressed their deep concern about the\r\nsituation of the \"Ilascu Group\", as of today the members of\r\nthe Group are still illegally detained. Another example is\r\nthis: the Moldovans from the left bank of the Dniester\r\nriver are prohibited from using the Latin alphabet in their\r\nschooling. The separatist leaders from Tiraspol continue to\r\nobstruct the signing of the already-endorsed agreement on\r\nthe legal status and the modalities and stages of the\r\ncomplete withdrawal of the 14th Army.\r\nI want to emphasize once again that a complete,\r\norderly and unconditional withdrawal of foreign military\r\ntroops from the territory of the Republic of Moldova is the\r\nwill of our people. This will is clearly reflected in our\r\nConstitution, which forbids the deployment of foreign\r\ntroops on the territory of the Republic of Moldova. In this\r\ncontext, it should be mentioned that the authorities of the\r\nRussian Federation show a correct understanding of our\r\nposition. I would like to underline the important role of the\r\ninternational community, the international organizations,\r\nincluding the United Nations, and especially the Conference\r\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in\r\nfacilitating the bilateral negotiations.\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate\r\nEstonia and Latvia on the withdrawal of foreign military\r\ntroops from their territory and, at the same time, to express\r\nour hope that the international community will support the\r\nsame kind of appropriate and orderly withdrawal of foreign\r\ntroops in the case of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nI should like to touch upon the subject of separatism\r\nand discuss it in a larger perspective. It is well known that\r\nmany regions of the world are currently affected by\r\nseparatist tendencies. Respecting the right of nations to\r\nself-determination - a fundamental right outlined in\r\ninternational documents - we cannot ignore the fact that this\r\nright is often used as a tool serving the interests of certain\r\npolitical groups and, in that context, this right has nothing\r\nto do with the legitimate aspirations of people to liberty and\r\nnational sovereignty.\r\nToday, in my opinion, at the end of the millennium\r\nthe separatist phenomenon is an extremely negative one,\r\nand to ignore it can lead to tragic consequences for many\r\ncountries - indeed, for the entire world. In such\r\ncircumstances, can we afford to allow dozens of\r\nartificially induced States to emerge as a result of the\r\npressure of certain interested political groups? Will this\r\nfurther the strengthening of international stability and\r\nsecurity? We do not believe so. Given that the majority\r\nof States have a multi-ethnic configuration, and could be\r\naffected by such separatist tendencies, we cannot but\r\nemphasize the dangers this might entail. That is why we\r\nbelieve that this kind of separatism - today’s deadly world\r\nvirus - must be condemned by the international\r\ncommunity. We think that this issue should be more\r\nclosely examined, and we hope that the United Nations\r\nwill give due attention to this matter.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova has joined the United\r\nNations as a young European country. Our European\r\naspirations are determined by our geopolitical and cultural\r\naffiliations to the European democratic space, and we are\r\nlinked to it by our Latin heritage also. For us, to be\r\nisolated from the European space and its values means to\r\nfacilitate the re-emergence of some influences from which\r\nwe suffered painfully in the recent past. That is why our\r\nvital and fundamental goal is the integration of our\r\ncountry into Europe. In this context, we firmly look\r\nforward to increasing cooperation and linkage with the\r\nCouncil of Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO), the Western European Union (WEU), and the\r\nCSCE, including expanding our relations with the\r\nEuropean Union, which represents the main guarantee of\r\ndemocratic practices and values.\r\nThe implementation of our options depends crucially\r\non the willingness of the economic and political-strategic\r\nEuro-Atlantic structures to support Moldova actively.\r\nI think that establishing economic relations with the\r\nindependent States of the former Soviet Union and joining\r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States - where we\r\nparticipate only in the economic structures and are not\r\ninvolved in collective security or political-military\r\ncooperation - will not become an obstacle to our gradual\r\nintegration into the Euro-Atlantic structures. We believe\r\nthat in these times nobody wants new dividing lines in\r\nEurope or in any other part of the world. On the\r\ncontrary, we need to eliminate those once generated by\r\nthe cold war. At the turn of the century, not only Europe\r\nbut the whole world finds itself in a complex process of\r\ntransformation. We want to establish new forms of\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\ncollaboration that would respond to the aspirations and the\r\nneeds of all States.\r\nThe day is approaching when the international\r\ncommunity will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations. In all these years the\r\nUnited Nations has been - and it remains - the major\r\nuniversal centre for maintaining peace and international\r\nsecurity and for mobilizing the efforts of States, in\r\ncooperation with regional organizations, towards settling\r\nglobal issues. The Republic of Moldova has the honour to\r\ncontribute, together with other States, to the implementation\r\nof the noble ideals of the World Organization. I am\r\nespecially pleased to inform the Assembly that a committee\r\nfor coordinating the activities and manifestations dedicated\r\nto the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations has been created in the Republic of Moldova.\r\nIn calling to mind the achievements and successes of\r\nthe United Nations system, we cannot but mention the fact\r\nthat so far it has operated under the guidance of a Charter\r\nconceived 50 years ago. I think that the new international\r\nrealities might call for some essential modifications to adapt\r\nthe provisions of the Charter to these realities.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova supports the reforms\r\ninitiated by the United Nations aimed at improving the\r\nefficiency of the Organization and its major bodies.\r\nOur country shares the views expressed by the\r\ndelegations of many countries within the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group regarding the issue of fair representation on\r\nthe Security Council. The Council’s composition, its\r\nfunctioning and methods of work should be modified\r\nwithout affecting the efficiency of its activities in its main\r\nfield, which is ensuring international peace and security.\r\nTaking into account the active role and contribution\r\nperformed in the United Nations by Germany and Japan\r\nand their possibilities of assuming specific responsibilities\r\nin keeping international peace and security, Moldova\r\nsupports the candidatures of these two countries as\r\npermanent members of the Security Council. Our position\r\non fair representation on the Security Council is that it is\r\nnecessary to take into account all regional groups\r\nrecognized in the United Nations. In this sense, the\r\nRepublic of Moldova supports the proposal of the\r\nNetherlands to grant an additional seat to each geographic\r\ngroup, including countries from Eastern Europe.\r\nConsultations and debates on such an important\r\nsubject should be supplemented with practical\r\norganizational and procedural measures, such as setting\r\nup some subsidiary bodies of the Security Council in\r\naccordance with Article 29 of the Charter, and increasing\r\nand expanding cooperation with the General Assembly\r\nand the regional organizations.\r\nAt the same time, we consider that the working\r\nmethods of the most representative body of the United\r\nNations - the General Assembly - could also be modified.\r\nWe are all interested in directing those activities as much\r\nas possible towards consolidating the principles of justice,\r\ndemocracy and development. The delegation of Moldova\r\nsupports the decisions adopted at the forty-seventh session\r\naimed at increasing the efficiency of the General\r\nAssembly and rationalizing the activities of its\r\nCommissions.\r\nThere is a direct link between peace and security on\r\nthe one hand and economic and social development on\r\nthe other. In this new era, when the United Nations is\r\nincreasing its efforts to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity, we should not forget about the persistence of\r\ninequalities and of grave social and economic problems,\r\nwhich affect all countries, particularly those in transition\r\nand the developing ones. In this sense, reform of the\r\nOrganization should include economic and social\r\nmechanisms, especially the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThis reform, already initiated, should be more effective in\r\nimplementation and be more rational in the utilization of\r\navailable resources.\r\nIn this context, I should like to stress the importance\r\nof the two previous sessions of the Commission for\r\nSustainable Development, whose work we hope will\r\nmaintain and intensify the impulse generated by the Rio\r\nde Janeiro Conference on Environment and Development\r\nwith respect to the rapid implementation of the\r\ncommitments made in the framework of Agenda 21.\r\nTurning to another matter, I would like to note that\r\nthe Republic of Moldova is aware of the financial crisis\r\nof the Organization. We are not indifferent to this\r\nsituation, and I would like to assure the Assembly that\r\nmy country will do its best to fulfil its commitments.\r\nThe recommendations of the last session of the\r\nCommittee on Contributions concerning the\r\nre-examination and adjustment of the scale of assessments\r\nof Member States reflect more justly States’ real capacity\r\nto pay. We hope that the General Assembly will take\r\nthese recommendations into consideration in the spirit of\r\njustice and solidarity which characterizes the United\r\nNations.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nIn conclusion, I express the hope that the constructive\r\natmosphere that characterizes the United Nations will help\r\nus to identify the problems faced by the international\r\ncommunity and to find the necessary solutions.\r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Moldova expresses\r\nits readiness to cooperate most actively and efficiently with\r\nthe delegations of other States in order to achieve the high\r\ngoals of the United Nations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Moldova for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Mircea Ion Snegur, President of the Republic of\r\nMoldova, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan, President\r\nof the Republic of Suriname\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname.\r\nMr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan, President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname, His Excellency Mr. Runaldo Ronald\r\nVenetiaan, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Venetiaan: Our world is moving into a\r\nnew era which has not yet taken a permanent shape. This\r\nprocess of change entails profound transformations, some\r\nof which promote development, the rule of law, respect for\r\nhuman rights and care for the environment, while others\r\npresent a serious threat to life and to the world itself.\r\nDuring this process cultural, social and political principles\r\nwhich once seemed to be of eternal value are superseded by\r\nnew ones.\r\nIn many parts of the world instability reigns, causing\r\ntragedy and chaos.\r\nIn these challenging times, Sir, your unanimous\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\nninth session merits compliments. Your election to this\r\nhigh office is a demonstration of the Member States’\r\nconfidence in you. The Republic of Suriname is\r\nconvinced that under Your Excellency’s guidance our\r\ndeliberations during this important year will produce\r\ntangible results.\r\nWe pay tribute to Ambassador Samuel Insanally of\r\nGuyana for the excellent way in which he presided at the\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe vital, extraordinary and excellent manner in\r\nwhich Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali fulfils his mission as\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations in these critical\r\ntimes of intensified disputes, war and violence earns our\r\ngratitude, admiration and respect. We wish to thank him\r\nmost heartily and, at the same time, congratulate him on\r\nhis important role in shaping the future of the\r\ninternational system.\r\nEvents during recent years have confronted the\r\ninternational community with the reality that the demise\r\nof the confrontational clash of ideologies did not\r\nautomatically usher in the stability and prosperity to\r\nwhich we all aspire. Immense problems persist in the\r\npolitical, social and economic spheres and at the national,\r\nregional and international levels.\r\nWe are witnessing the eruption, the continuation and\r\nthe spreading of severe national and ethnic rivalries, as in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda. These conflicts\r\nand disputes have given rise to the emergence of a large\r\nnumber of displaced persons, who are subjected to the\r\nworst kind of harassment, starvation and deprivation.\r\nThese manifestations are compounded by practices\r\nthat once again leave a shameful blot on our civilization.\r\nThe international community cannot close its eyes to\r\nthese practices or fail to act in the face of such horrifying\r\nand unacceptable situations. Such crises, regardless of the\r\nvarious causes and motives from which they may ensue,\r\ntend to have in common the fact that masses of innocent\r\nwomen, children and elderly people pay the price and\r\nbear the brunt of conflicts and wars.\r\nThe real concern is not only the number of victims\r\nclaimed or the scale of the destruction that may ensue but\r\nalso the possibility that the seeds of those conflicts will\r\nspread, both in the developed and in the developing\r\ncountries, in the absence of the attention of a world order\r\ncapable of containing and addressing their causes.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nIt is legitimate for the international community to\r\nregard these problems as a shared burden and to strive for\r\ntheir peaceful and prompt solution on the basis of practical\r\ncooperation. We should in the short term resort to such\r\nmechanisms as are deemed practical to come to the\r\nimmediate rescue of those who are suffering. Furthermore,\r\nwe should increase our efforts to eliminate the deeprooted\r\ncauses of the unresolved national conflicts, to ensure the\r\ncivil and human rights of ethnic minorities and to promote\r\npeaceful coexistence through respect for each other’s race,\r\ncolour, ethnicity, religion and sex. If we fail to do so, the\r\nsuffering will be prolonged and will threaten regional and\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAs we discuss the issues now confronting our world,\r\nwe cannot but refer to the importance of building a new\r\nreality that aims at the full development of the people’s\r\npotential through the establishment of peace, the building of\r\ndemocracy and the shaping of sound economies.\r\nWe know that it is a difficult process to establish\r\ndemocracy, dependable democratic institutions and a\r\ndemocratic culture. Notwithstanding the commitment or\r\nvigour with which our Governments strive to achieve this\r\nobjective, the process is bound to be slow and full of\r\ncomplications. Suriname is convinced, however, that we\r\nmust endeavour to reach this goal, led by the perception\r\nthat the core of democracy, as we see it, is not merely\r\nadherence to an ideal system but one of the most important\r\nprerequisites for a stable, united and integrated society that\r\ncan swiftly settle its differences, realize its aspirations and\r\nenjoy and preserve its cultural, political and socio-economic\r\nachievements.\r\nThe commitment of Suriname to the cause of\r\ndemocracy is strengthened by the distressing experience of\r\nthe rule of dictatorship under which its people had to live\r\nsome years ago. There are indeed tremendous efforts\r\ninvolved in bringing a democratic system back on track.\r\nOur involvement in the building of a new national\r\npolitical reality establishes a link between us and the\r\nregional process of political renewal, in which Governments\r\nof the region are faced with the complex task of restoring\r\nand safeguarding democracy.\r\nIndeed, in Latin America and the Caribbean,\r\ndemocracy has suffered some severe setbacks.\r\nThe problems of Haiti are of particular concern to us.\r\nThe violent and illegal interruption of the democratic\r\nprocess in this country has led to continued violations of\r\nhuman rights, to increased poverty and to suffering for\r\nthe Haitian people, as well as to the flight of thousands\r\nfrom their home country. It is against this background\r\nthat my Government has granted a request to provide a\r\ntemporary safe haven for Haitian refugees and has\r\npledged its support to the multinational force.\r\nFurthermore, my Government decided to make\r\nmembers of the national army and the police force\r\navailable to the United Nations mission in Haiti, which,\r\nwithin the framework of the implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 940 (1994), will become operational\r\nsimultaneously with the restoration of the democratic\r\nGovernment under the leadership of President Jean-\r\nBertrand Aristide.\r\nMy Government’s decision to support and participate\r\nin the United Nations mission in Haiti was inspired by its\r\nconception of regional and international responsibility to\r\ncontribute to the safeguarding of constitutional democracy\r\nin the region.\r\nWe believe that our hemisphere is in need of\r\npermanent mechanisms to guarantee swift and direct\r\naction when democracy is threatened - for example, by\r\nthe unconstitutional take-over of Governments.\r\nThe significant efforts made by the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of American States, including the\r\nvarious resolutions adopted, the missions sent to Haiti and\r\nthe threat of an immediate military intervention, have\r\nfinally convinced the military leadership to step down not\r\nlater than 15 October.\r\nIn a general sense, we are hopeful that current\r\ndevelopments in Haiti, which are the result of initiatives\r\ntaken within the framework of the United Nations, will\r\nlead to a peaceful resolution of the crisis. Suriname\r\nwishes to emphasize that all efforts to restore democracy\r\nin Haiti will appear to have been in vain if the rich\r\ncountries do not forthwith pool financial resources in a\r\nfund for the reconstruction and development of Haiti.\r\nThe developments in South Africa which led to the\r\ndemise of the abhorrent regime of apartheid and to the\r\nestablishment of a democratic and non-racist South Africa\r\nhave led to the conviction that in the end the rightful\r\nstruggle of people for justice, equality and majority rule\r\nwill meet with success. Indeed, the birth of the new\r\nSouth Africa last April has demonstrated that structures\r\nimposed by force cannot survive the determination of\r\nthose who seek justice.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nThe people and Government of the Republic of\r\nSuriname wish to congratulate the people of South Africa\r\nand their leaders, especially President Nelson Mandela, on\r\nthis success, which will have a positive impact on the world\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe are all greatly indebted to the Special Committee\r\nagainst Apartheid, which for 32 years played a vital role in\r\nglobal efforts to end apartheid. My country is confident\r\nthat the new Government in South Africa will cope well\r\nwith the new challenges it faces. We hope that the\r\ninternational community will not wait to assist the new\r\nGovernment in bringing about the necessary economic and\r\nsocial changes to build a future of security, stability and\r\nprosperity for the South African people.\r\nThe many positive political changes and international\r\nbreakthroughs resulting from the end of the cold-war era\r\nhave had a profound influence on the problem of the\r\nMiddle East, especially the Palestine issue. The conflict\r\nhas taken a positive turn in line with those changes. My\r\nGovernment wishes to record its satisfaction over the\r\nhistoric agreement signed between Israel and Jordan, which\r\nfollowed the accord between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization in September 1993. The historic\r\nopportunity to achieve lasting peace has now materialized\r\nand the international community must guarantee that this\r\nimportant momentum is not lost.\r\nThe statistics of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the World Bank and the United Nations give\r\nrise to only one conclusion: that we live in a world beset\r\nby inequality, gross disparity and imbalance in the\r\ndistribution of wealth and resources, and urgent solutions\r\nfor the economic situation of developing countries are\r\nrequired.\r\nThe problem of economic imbalance is not limited to\r\na few countries or to one region. It is a global issue - just\r\nas peace and democracy are global issues - and for that\r\nreason this forum must deal with it as a matter of priority.\r\nNo longer is it the nuclear nightmare that frightens us most:\r\nrather, it is the scourge of poverty, which continues to\r\nerode the foundations of our civilization.\r\nIn Suriname, as elsewhere in Latin America, the\r\nCaribbean and other regions, bold but necessary reforms\r\nhave been set in motion to eliminate obstacles to\r\ndevelopment and economic competitiveness in order to\r\nadapt to new international realities. In this context, my\r\ncountry is endeavouring to rehabilitate and reconstruct the\r\nbeleaguered economy of our nation on a sound and solid\r\nfoundation.\r\nWithin the framework of these economic reforms we\r\nconsider the development of human resources to be a\r\npriority issue. We consider it to be extremely important\r\nto improve the living conditions and basic health and\r\nnutrition of our people. We are committed to these goals\r\nbecause we believe that every human being has the\r\nultimate right to development.\r\nThe austerity measures which were subscribed to by\r\nmy Government have not been easy to implement because\r\nof the weakness of the economy and the hardships and\r\nsuffering they impose on our people. Notwithstanding the\r\nprogress made so far, it is obvious that such an\r\nundertaking calls for the availability of vast resources,\r\nwhich cannot be mobilized at the national level only. We\r\ntherefore have called on the international community to\r\nprovide assistance to complement our domestic efforts.\r\nIn particular, we have called on our historical partner to\r\nfulfil the agreements reached in this context and to\r\nsupport us in our attempts to create prosperity for our\r\npeople.\r\nWe must add to this that it is our obligation to see\r\nto it that our need for aid does not lead to the\r\nrecolonization of our country.\r\nMy Government shares the international\r\ncommunity’s concern for the fragile ecosystem in our\r\nworld, which must be protected. Like other developing\r\ncountries, Suriname is confronted with the challenge to\r\nmeet its present development needs and simultaneously\r\nsafeguard the environment and natural resources for\r\ngenerations to come. In trying to establish a sound\r\nbalance between development and environment my\r\nGovernment has committed itself to taking all the\r\nmeasures necessary to protect and preserve the\r\nenvironment, in accordance with the guidelines adopted\r\nby the Rio de Janeiro Conference, and has incorporated\r\nthe concept of sustainable development in its national\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\nIf the international community does not have the\r\npolitical will to deal effectively with the crises occurring\r\nin so many economies, the world will continue to lack\r\nstability and will remain vulnerable to upheavals and\r\nsetbacks that could undermine the foundations of the\r\nfuture.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nIn the context of the recently held International\r\nConference on Population and Development and the\r\nforthcoming Fourth World Conference on Women, a World\r\nSummit for Social Development is therefore a timely\r\ninitiative as it will provide an opportunity to embark on an\r\nin-depth analysis of human development in all its aspects.\r\nThese international meetings should afford all of us the\r\nopportunity to address in an integrated manner the issues of\r\npoverty, unemployment and social integration.\r\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean various\r\nencouraging initiatives have been taken to deal effectively\r\nwith the imperatives of economic and social development\r\nand to enhance the capability of the countries of the region\r\nto respond to the pressing challenges ahead. Joint efforts\r\naimed at the strengthening of regional integration and\r\ncooperation have been made.\r\nOn 24 July 1994 in Cartagena, Colombia, we stood at\r\nthe cradle of the Association of Caribbean States, an\r\nassociation which brings together member States of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM), the countries of\r\nCentral America, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti,\r\nSuriname, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela. This is\r\nindeed proof of the growing awareness among the\r\nleadership in the region that closer economic and political\r\nrelations are tools to enhance our capacity to bring\r\nprosperity to our peoples. By joining the Association of\r\nCaribbean States, Suriname has demonstrated that it is part\r\nof the region and wants to participate in the shaping of its\r\nfuture.\r\nSuriname has also explored the possibility of joining\r\nCARICOM as a full member since it believes that by\r\njoining Suriname will both enhance its own capacity to\r\nintensify regional cooperation and bring to the Caribbean\r\nCommunity its cultural richness and its economic\r\nopportunities.\r\nOur hemisphere, which includes both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries, is being challenged to take the\r\nopportunity provided by global changes to develop\r\ninitiatives for the cultivation of international relations\r\nconducive to prosperity for all on the basis of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, social reform and equity.\r\nIn the light of these aims, my country welcomes the\r\nproposed Summit for the Americas, to be held in December\r\n1994, at which representatives of countries of the Western\r\nhemisphere will come together to address these issues and\r\nto act as catalysts for the changes needed in the\r\ndevelopment patterns of both the countries of the North and\r\nthose of the South in order for them to reach their\r\ncommon goals.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea has on many occasions been described as one of the\r\nmost important multilateral legal instruments of our\r\ncentury. My Government participated actively in its\r\npreparation, and I take great pleasure in congratulating the\r\nworld community on the coming into force of this\r\nConvention on 16 November 1994.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, I also wish to express\r\nmy satisfaction with the agreement that has been reached\r\nwith regard to the mining of minerals in the deep sea-bed,\r\nas contemplated in the aforementioned Convention.\r\nAll Members of the United Nations pledge their\r\nsupport for the principles and initiatives of the United\r\nNations. At the same time, the Member States are\r\nkeeping an eye both on the kind of support and on the\r\nlevel of assistance they can generate from this\r\nOrganization. Suriname does so.\r\nFor Suriname, many aid programmes from the\r\nspecialized agencies and other United Nations bodies have\r\nbeen hampered by the implementation of one of the main\r\ncriteria for assistance. Suriname was counted among the\r\nnet contributors of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme because our national per capita income was\r\ncalculated to be higher than $3,000. This figure is wrong\r\nbecause of an unrealistic official exchange rate. Now that\r\nthe official exchange rate has moved to a realistic level,\r\nwhich is more than 100 times the former rate, Suriname\r\nis looking forward to a readjustment of its status and\r\nsubsequently to a reclassification, and also to the aid\r\nprogramme that will follow this transformation.\r\nWe are involved in an evolutionary process, with\r\nboth the world and the United Nations adjusting to new\r\ndemands with regard to peace, security and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. It is clear that a new international order\r\nbased on the democratic participation of all States calls\r\nfor a restructuring and strengthening of the United\r\nNations in response to its new responsibilities. Indeed,\r\nthe role of the United Nations has taken on more\r\nrelevance than ever before, and it is most urgent for the\r\ninternational community to restructure this Organization\r\nin order to enable it to play the important role for which\r\nit was created.\r\nThe celebration in 1995 of the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations will be a good occasion on which to\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nreflect on the new role of the Organization and the\r\nattainment of that objective, provided that the relations\r\nbetween the General Assembly, the Security Council and\r\nthe Secretary-General are reorganized.\r\nMy Government is committed to contributing to the\r\nsuccessful outcome of this endeavour.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency The Honourable André Ouellet,\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Canada.\r\nMr. Ouellet (Canada) (interpretation from French):\r\nCanada is very pleased, Sir, that you have been elected to\r\nthe presidency of the Assembly, and it is certain that you\r\nwill, with tact and efficiency, assume the responsibility of\r\nguiding our work. You can count on our full cooperation.\r\nThe United Nations has always had a special place in\r\nCanada’s foreign policy. As I address the Assembly for the\r\nfirst time as Minister of Foreign Affairs, I am reminded of\r\nsomething one of my illustrious predecessors, Lester B.\r\nPearson, said about the United Nations:\r\n\"We must cultivate international ideals, develop\r\ninternational policies, strengthen international\r\ninstitutions, above all the United Nations, so that\r\npeace and progress can be made secure.\"\r\nThe Government that I represent shares his broad and\r\nnoble vision of the role and place of the United Nations.\r\nIn order to face the challenges that await it at the dawn of\r\nthe twenty-first century, the international community needs,\r\nmore than ever, a strong, credible multilateral institution\r\nequipped with the tools needed to fulfil our expectations.\r\nThese challenges are the maintenance of peace and\r\ninternational security, as well as development, justice,\r\ndemocracy, human rights and the fight against inequalities.\r\nAt a time when we are preparing to celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, there is no more\r\nurgent task than the intensification of our efforts for\r\nreform in order to give our Organization the second wind\r\nit needs. Let us draw inspiration from the vision and\r\nenthusiasm of the people who drafted the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations 50 years ago.\r\nThe extensive upheavals that have shaken our planet\r\nsince the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold\r\nwar can be symbolized in a few images. I am thinking of\r\nthe moving image of President Nelson Mandela taking the\r\noath of office as democratically elected President of South\r\nAfrica and the historic handshake between Prime Minister\r\nYitzhak Rabin and the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\nleader, Yasser Arafat. For their people and those in\r\nCambodia, El Salvador - and soon, perhaps, Mozambique\r\nand Angola - who have discovered the road to peace, with\r\nthe help of the United Nations, the future is filled with\r\nhope.\r\nThere is also hope in Haiti, where a courageous\r\npeople has been subjected for too long to oppression and\r\nabject poverty. We shall share their joy when they can\r\nfinally welcome to his native land President Aristide, a\r\nliving symbol of nascent democracy.\r\nBut there are also unbearable images of the victims\r\nin the market in Sarajevo and the flood of humanity\r\nfleeing the killings in Rwanda.\r\nThe international community cannot remain\r\nindifferent to conflicts that threaten the lives of millions\r\nof innocent people and expose them to the worst\r\nviolations of their most fundamental rights. Recent\r\nexperience has shown us that only a concerted and\r\ndetermined effort on the part of the international\r\ncommunity can solve these problems.\r\nIt is no easy task. Faced with the problems in\r\nBosnia, Somalia, Rwanda or even Haiti, some people will\r\nbe tempted to give up and wonder if the United Nations\r\nis wrong in trying to resolve essentially internal conflicts\r\nthat have numerous complex causes.\r\nCanada does not share this opinion. We think that,\r\ndespite these problems, the Security Council is on the\r\nright track, even though the steps it has taken have not\r\nalways proved capable of solving all the problems.\r\nConsistent with that belief, we have always made a\r\ntangible contribution to United Nations operations, as far\r\nas our circumstances permit.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nThe Canadian contribution to peace-keeping operations\r\nin the territories of the former Yugoslavia totals more than\r\n2,000 soldiers and civilian police. The Canadian\r\nGovernment decided a few days ago to renew once more\r\nthe mandate of its troops for a six-month period. Canada\r\nhas always been convinced that there can be no military\r\nsolution to the Yugoslavian conflict. It is because we wish\r\nto give peace another chance that we have chosen to\r\nmaintain our contribution to the United Nations Protection\r\nForce.\r\nWe have also responded to the Secretary-General’s\r\nappeal for help in the tragedy of Rwanda. For two months\r\nours was the only country providing an air bridge to Kigali.\r\nThere are 600 Canadian soldiers serving under the United\r\nNations flag, and many Canadian non-governmental\r\norganizations have mobilized to provide help to those in\r\ndistress.\r\nWe will also be in Haiti, with 600 soldiers and 100\r\npolice officers when the time comes to deploy the United\r\nNations peace-keeping force. Our participation is a logical\r\nsequel to our numerous efforts of the past three years to\r\nrestore the democratic process in this country, to which we\r\nare attached by language, geographical proximity and the\r\nmany personal ties between our peoples. The Haitian\r\npeople can count on Canada’s lasting help as they rebuild\r\ntheir economy.\r\nWe are also contributing to the Middle East peace\r\nprocess. As the leader of the multilateral Working Group\r\non Refugees, we are tackling with determination that task\r\nentrusted to us by the international community. Our\r\nobjective is to contribute to the construction of a renewed\r\nregion where, 10 years hence, no one will consider himself\r\nor herself a refugee. We are also providing substantial\r\nfinancial assistance to the Palestinian people’s\r\nreconstruction projects. We would favourably consider\r\nsending peace-keepers if the need should arise, thus\r\ncarrying on a lengthy tradition of Canadian participation in\r\npeace-keeping operations in the region.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe economic and social problems facing the\r\ninternational community often receive less headline\r\nattention than the armed conflicts. However, they are every\r\nbit as urgent. Hundreds of millions of people around the\r\nworld continue to be condemned to a life of poverty. For\r\nwhole sectors of humanity, such basic needs as a proper\r\ndiet, drinking water, education and medical care are more\r\nof a dream than a reality.\r\nCertain parts of the developing world are currently\r\nexperiencing remarkable progress, while others,\r\nunfortunately - the African continent in particular - are\r\ncontinuing to struggle.\r\nIt is estimated that there are an unprecedented 19\r\nmillion refugees and displaced persons in the world. We\r\nare witnessing a massive movement of people that none\r\nof our societies is able to manage without the cooperation\r\nof the entire international community.\r\nThe recent Cairo Conference revealed the urgent\r\nneed for effective measures to cope with the problems of\r\npopulation and development, problems that cannot be\r\nresolved without giving full recognition to the essential\r\nroles of women.\r\nOur ability to translate into reality the concept of\r\nsustainable development will have a very direct impact on\r\nthe daily lives of our fellow citizens. The fishermen of\r\nNewfoundland and the Maritime Provinces of Canada are\r\nall too familiar with this problem. Their livelihood has\r\ndisappeared, through the plundering of fish stocks in\r\ninternational waters off our shores. This is why we\r\nbelieve an agreement must be reached without delay on\r\nfishing on the high seas.\r\nWe could easily add to the list of pressing problems\r\nthat I have just mentioned. And no one can challenge the\r\nfact that all of these problems - from peace-keeping to\r\ndevelopment, including the fight against AIDS, drug-\r\ntrafficking and the protection of human rights and the\r\nenvironment - require a determined, coordinated effort on\r\nthe part of the international community.\r\nA great deal has been done over the past few years\r\nto help our multilateral institutions to effectively face\r\nthese numerous challenges. However, much more needs\r\nto be done. Too often, the intervention of the United\r\nNations comes too late, is too slow and is carried out\r\nunder inadequate conditions.\r\nThe lack of political will on the part of Member\r\nStates cannot be blamed on the Secretary-General. On\r\nthe contrary, I would like to pay special tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff. They have done more\r\nand better than anyone should expect from an institution\r\ndeprived of the most elementary resources, lacking even\r\na solid financial foundation.\r\nWe must fully assume our responsibilities and give\r\nthe United Nations the tools required to fulfil its unique\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nmandate successfully. However, it seems that we are\r\nunable to take a second look at the habits of the past.\r\nWe invest too much energy in activities of marginal\r\nuse and in unimportant quarrels when there is an\r\nemergency right under our noses.\r\nWe waste valuable resources by allowing the\r\nnumerous institutions and agencies we have created over\r\nthe years to jealously protect their independence and resist\r\nchange when circumstances require a pooling of energies.\r\nAs a result of our extreme reticence to implement\r\nadministrative reforms, we are handicapping the only\r\ninstitution on which we can depend, when modern and\r\nflexible management methods would enable us to respond\r\nmuch more effectively to the needs of the moment.\r\nCanada believes that the reforms of the United Nations\r\nsystem must be deepened and accelerated. We must do\r\nmore and better with the resources at our disposal.\r\nEfforts should be concentrated on the following five\r\nmajor priorities, which I would like to bring to your\r\nattention.\r\nFirstly, we must strengthen the United Nations\r\nsystem’s capacity for preventive action. The United\r\nNations already has a number of tools for detecting\r\npotential conflicts, and can use a variety of mechanisms to\r\ntry to eliminate problems before crises break out. Lack of\r\ninformation is not the problem; what we need is the ability\r\nto better analyse this information, to develop appropriate\r\nstrategies and above all to mobilize energy from all\r\ncomponents of the system.\r\nIn order to act rapidly, the United Nations must be\r\nable to count on qualified human resources, available on\r\nshort notice, to complement its own personnel. This is why\r\nCanada has prepared for the Secretary-General an inventory\r\nof resource persons suited to missions of good offices or\r\nspecializing in elections, human rights, the administration\r\nof justice and other such fields.\r\nAt its first summit in January 1992, the Security\r\nCouncil recognized that non-military sources of instability\r\nin the economic, social, humanitarian and ecological fields\r\nhave become threats to international peace and security.\r\nLet us recognize once and for all the need to expand the\r\ntraditional concept of security, and to mobilize all\r\ncomponents of the United Nations system to attack conflict\r\nat its very roots.\r\nWe also feel that the preventive capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations system will be strengthened if we make\r\nbetter use of the expertise of those who have direct\r\nknowledge of the field. The United Nations Economic\r\nand Social Council should periodically hold public\r\nhearings, similar to those held last June on the Agenda\r\nfor Development, with a view to assisting the United\r\nNations to better anticipate problems and to develop\r\nstrategies for attacking the economic and social causes of\r\nconflicts. The findings of its hearings could and should\r\nbe provided to the Security Council and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral so that they can develop appropriate preventive\r\nmeasures.\r\nAny strategy for preventing armed conflicts also\r\ninvolves pursuing tangible disarmament objectives.\r\nCanada has established two priority objectives for the\r\nnext few years: nuclear non-proliferation and the control\r\nof conventional arms.\r\nNuclear arms control and disarmament are under\r\nway: we are continuing negotiations on a comprehensive\r\ntest-ban treaty to ban nuclear testing for all time. Canada\r\nis working in the Conference on Disarmament to secure\r\na mandate for negotiations on a convention to prohibit the\r\nproduction of fissile material for weapons purposes.\r\nTogether, these treaties will have the effect of\r\nconstraining and preventing a future nuclear arms race.\r\nIn 1995 we will have to decide the fate of the\r\nworld’s nuclear non-proliferation regime; the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is very\r\nimportant for Canada, and we believe that there is only\r\none option: that the NPT must be indefinitely extended.\r\nI urge all Governments to support this option, which will\r\nallow for the continuation of a crucial instrument in\r\npreventing the spread of nuclear-weapon technology and\r\nprovide new impetus to reduce existing stocks.\r\nWe must also recognize that, although the threat of\r\nnuclear weapons is of prime concern, the ongoing use of\r\nconventional weapons is an equally dangerous and very\r\nreal threat to peace and security.\r\nThe task of controlling conventional weapons is the\r\nresponsibility of every Government. Huge sums are\r\nbeing spent each year purchasing such weapons, often to\r\nthe detriment of services essential to the public, such as\r\neducation and health care. Those who are more\r\nconcerned about the size of their military arsenal than\r\nabout the welfare of their people should no longer expect\r\nto receive unconditional international aid.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nThe recently established United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms is a start, and I urge Member States to\r\nmake information available to the Register as Canada has\r\ndone.\r\nMore can be done, however. For example, next year\r\nwe will be reviewing the Convention on certain\r\nconventional weapons that deals with land-mines. The\r\nabuse of land-mines is responsible for continued suffering\r\nand death of civilians long after the fighting has stopped.\r\nI welcome the proposal made by President Clinton on\r\nMonday to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of anti-\r\npersonnel land mines. He can count on the support and\r\nassistance of the Government of Canada on this useful idea.\r\nWe must strengthen the Convention by extending its scope\r\nto cover internal as well as international conflicts and by\r\ninsisting on effective verification measures to ensure\r\ncompliance. We will create a task force in Canada to\r\nconsider other initiatives that might be taken in the coming\r\nmonths, and I look forward to sharing ideas on this subject\r\nwith other ministers.\r\nSecondly, we must conduct an in-depth review of the\r\nUnited Nations economic and social activities. I think I\r\nspeak for most members of the Assembly when I express\r\nserious concerns regarding what can best be described as\r\nthe drift of the United Nations in the economic and social\r\nsectors. While the debate on the United Nations mandate\r\nin the areas of peace and security is lively and productive,\r\nit is unfortunately too often vague and directionless when\r\nwe tackle economic and social problems.\r\nWe are not saying that everything must be changed -\r\nfar from it. But certain reforms have already been\r\nintroduced; to mention but one, we welcome the decision\r\nto make the United Nations Development Programme\r\nAdministrator responsible for system-wide coordination.\r\nBut at a time when large sectors of international economic\r\nactivities are beyond the control of States, and when the\r\nresources devoted to development and international\r\ncooperation are subject to all manner of constraint in all of\r\nour countries, we must rethink the role and mandate of all\r\nour multilateral institutions, including those of Bretton\r\nWoods. These questions will be taken up at next year’s\r\nGroup of Seven summit, to be held in Halifax, and should\r\nbe debated as widely as possible within other relevant\r\ninstitutions.\r\nCanada is ready to proceed with a comprehensive re-\r\nevaluation of its multilateral system as it applies to\r\neconomic and social issues. If necessary, the relevance of\r\ncertain institutions must be rethought, and a real solution\r\nmust be found to the problem of duplication.\r\nWe expect great things of the next chapter of the\r\nSecretary-General’s Agenda for Development. We share\r\nto a great extent his visions of development, which\r\nencompass all facets of human activity, and particularly\r\nits social dimensions. Although the full importance of\r\nthese dimensions has finally been grasped, they are still\r\npoorly integrated in our development strategies. The time\r\nhas come to translate this vision into new operational\r\npriorities and to adapt our institutions and structures to it.\r\nThe Secretary-General should not hesitate to recommend\r\nradical reform if necessary. Together we can restore the\r\nrelevance and leadership of the United Nations system.\r\nWe must adapt it to the new realities of an ever-changing\r\nworld.\r\nThirdly, we must strengthen the rapid-intervention\r\ncapability of the United Nations. The implementation of\r\na number of the proposals advanced by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in \"An Agenda for Peace\" has enabled the United\r\nNations to make great strides in the area of peace-\r\nkeeping. Last April the Government of Canada took the\r\ninitiative of inviting the major troop-contributing countries\r\nto a meeting in Ottawa to discuss problems associated\r\nwith political direction, command and control and the\r\ntraining of peace-keeping- operations personnel.\r\nIn this regard, I am pleased to announce that Canada\r\nwill soon open a centre for peace-keeping research and\r\ntraining. The centre, to be located on the site of the\r\nformer military base in Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, will be\r\nnamed after Lester B. Pearson, Canadian recipient of the\r\nNobel Peace Prize. I invite Member States to come and\r\njoin us so they can share our experience and help fine-\r\ntune our future approach.\r\nThe experience of the last few years leads us to\r\nbelieve that we need to explore even more innovative\r\noptions than those considered to date. Recent peace-\r\nkeeping missions have demonstrated the limitations of the\r\ntraditional approach. As we now fully realize, rapid\r\ndeployment of intervention forces is essential.\r\nIn the light of the prevailing situation, the\r\nGovernment of Canada has decided to conduct an in-\r\ndepth review of the short-, medium- and long-term\r\noptions available to us to strengthen the rapid-response\r\ncapability of the United Nations in times of crisis. From\r\namong these options, we feel that the time has come to\r\nstudy the possibility, over the long term, of creating a\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\npermanent United Nations military force. We will ask the\r\nworld’s leading experts for their input and will inform all\r\nMember States of the results of the study.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nFourthly, we must improve the functioning of United\r\nNations decision-making bodies.\r\nThe Security Council currently bears enormous\r\nresponsibilities. Its decisions are binding on all Member\r\nStates and have a determining influence on millions of\r\npeople. It is essential that the Council be able to reflect as\r\naccurately as possible the wishes of the entire international\r\ncommunity. For this reason, it is imperative that the\r\ncomposition of the Council be reviewed. By making the\r\nCouncil more representative of today’s world, we can\r\nenhance the legitimacy of its actions and facilitate their\r\nimplementation. Canada will continue to play an active\r\nrole in the negotiations launched during the last session of\r\nthe General Assembly, with a view to concluding an\r\nagreement as soon as possible.\r\nHowever, an expanded Council must not be seen as a\r\npanacea. As we have said on a number of occasions, the\r\nCouncil must make its working methods more transparent\r\nand become more receptive to the viewpoints of non-\r\nmember States with special concerns. More specifically,\r\nCanada has advocated closer dialogue between the Council\r\nand troop-contributing countries. The informal practices\r\ndeveloped in recent years are a good start, but in our view\r\nwe must look for practical ways to institutionalize them.\r\nWe ask the members of the Council to keep an open mind\r\nin this regard.\r\nFinally, we must put the United Nations on a sound\r\nfinancial footing.\r\nIt goes without saying that the United Nations can\r\nfulfil the mandates we give it only to the extent that\r\nMember States meet their financial obligations and\r\ncontribute generously to its voluntary funds. The sums in\r\nquestion are no doubt modest when compared with those\r\ninvested elsewhere, but they represent none the less a\r\nburden that is already significant and growing larger at a\r\ntime when many of our countries, Canada most definitely\r\nincluded, are going through a difficult period of budgetary\r\nadjustment.\r\nOur taxpayers do not question the need to contribute\r\nto the United Nations, but they are entitled to expect that\r\ntheir contributions will be spent judiciously. That is why\r\nwe attach such great importance to the need for sound\r\nmanagement of the system’s resources. The recent\r\ncreation of the new position of inspector general should\r\nhelp tighten controls and improve administrative practices.\r\nThere is also a need to review budgetary procedures in\r\norder to make them more transparent and to simplify\r\nthose that govern peace-keeping operations.\r\nReviewing the scale of assessments is always a\r\nperilous undertaking, but I believe the need to do so has\r\nbecome urgent. The current system suffers from serious\r\ndistortions and no longer reflects properly Member States’\r\nability to pay. We hope the General Assembly will make\r\nthis a priority issue at the current session.\r\nIn the final analysis, the future of the United Nations\r\ndepends on the willingness of its Member States to lend\r\nit political and practical support. This support depends in\r\nturn on the degree of support the Organization receives\r\nfrom our respective citizenries. It is not only Member\r\nStates’ credibility that is at stake, but, even more\r\nimportant, that of the United Nations.\r\nGovernments must strive to work together and in\r\ncooperation with private enterprise and non-governmental\r\norganizations to define our new vision of the United\r\nNations for the next century. This is, in part, why the\r\nCanadian Government has provided support to the\r\nCanadian Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. That Committee, which brings together\r\nleaders from all sectors, has prepared a remarkable\r\nprogramme of activities to commemorate the anniversary\r\neverywhere in our country. The emphasis is being placed\r\non youth education and the main subjects of the United\r\nNations agenda.\r\nNext year at this time, all eyes will be turned\r\ntowards the General Assembly. Let us make that\r\nanniversary the beginning of a new era for the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nnext speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel,\r\nMr. Shimon Peres. I now call on him.\r\nMr. Peres (Israel): I should like to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly. We are pleased that the representative of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire - a nation for which Israel has high regard - has\r\nbeen elected to this distinguished post. I should like to\r\nexpress to the Secretary General our deepest appreciation\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nfor his contribution to world peace in general, and to peace\r\nin the Middle East in particular.\r\nA year ago, I offered a concept for a new Middle\r\nEast. Many applauded; more remained sceptical. What at\r\nthat time seemed lofty is today a reality. I feel I can\r\nsubmit today an invitation to a further journey in the new\r\nMiddle East.\r\nLast year was a year of remarkable events. The\r\nPalestinian people, as a result of our agreement, gained\r\nauthority in Gaza and Jericho; Jordan and Israel agreed, in\r\nthe Washington Declaration, to end the state of war and\r\nmove towards an agreement of full peace; voices of\r\npromise are exchanged between Damascus and Jerusalem;\r\nmultilateral meetings produced a network of regional\r\ncooperation; Morocco and Israel established formal\r\nrelations; and an agenda for a new Middle East will emerge\r\nfrom an unprecedented economic conference in Casablanca\r\nnext month.\r\nThe desire for peace is rooted in the millenniums of\r\nJewish existence. Generations prayed for it, and now a\r\nyoung generation in Israel is today engaged in making it.\r\nThe search for peace is shared by young people all over the\r\nMiddle East, Arabs and Israelis alike. We have to fulfil\r\ntheir hope.\r\nI am addressing this Assembly for the first time, not\r\nas a party to a controversy, but as a representative of a\r\ncountry that has shown a capacity to solve conflicts that\r\nseemed insoluble.\r\nThe United Nations should play an increasing role\r\nfacing the changing times. It can define new destinies. It\r\ncan adopt new means.\r\nAs the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, it may adopt models for new endeavours by\r\nmobilizing builders to construct peace, not just by\r\ndeploying troops to keep it. Economic structures will offer\r\nmore than military deployment.\r\nGaza, as an example, has a new authority. It needs a\r\nnew economy. The United Nations can provide an answer.\r\nThe 7,000 years of Gaza are mainly a history of suffering.\r\nIts population density today is among the highest in the\r\nworld.\r\nThere is a role for the United Nations in Gaza, and it\r\nhas played one. It began by stationing troops - which were\r\nrecalled, unfortunately, on the eve of the Six-Day War.\r\nThen UNRWA came and supplied food, health and\r\neducation to the refugees. Then UNDP contributed\r\ngreatly to the construction of an infrastructure in the Gaza\r\nStrip.\r\nThe United Nations can help Gaza today become\r\nfree from want. It can introduce there the necessary\r\neconomic and proper social institutions. An enlarged\r\nallocation for Gaza, with the existing United Nations\r\nadministration, will produce immediate results and may\r\nmake Gaza a new model of United Nations endeavours.\r\nThe world is moving from military might to social\r\npriorities. It is time to turn from political confrontation\r\nto economic cooperation. In the Middle East, economic\r\ngrowth can compensate for political compromises.\r\nWe no longer live in a closed world. The intensive\r\nflow of information has opened the eyes of many people.\r\nNo longer can tyranny blind their perceptions. Iron\r\ncurtains can no longer bar the spread of the true story.\r\nKnowledge has finally overcome propaganda.\r\nThis current is profound and lasting. The sources of\r\nstrength and wealth are today universal rather than\r\nnational, intellectual rather than material. The size of the\r\nterritory, the number of its people, the wealth of its raw\r\nmaterials, no longer decide the fate of a nation. It is the\r\nscope of education, the level of science, applied\r\ntechnology and up-to-date information that make all the\r\ndifference.\r\nIntellectual sources are no longer partitioned by\r\ntraditional divides. Science has no territorial limits.\r\nTechnology has no national flags. Information can travel\r\nwithout visas. Armies cannot conquer wisdom. Borders\r\ncannot protect knowledge. The talent of creation is\r\nreplacing the strategies of destruction. Computers, not\r\nrifles, mark the difference. The hunting season in history\r\nis disappearing.\r\nMs. Arystanbekova (Kazakhstan), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThis does not mean an end to agonies. Starvation,\r\ndisease, terrorism, desertification, nuclear weapons,\r\necological damage and dangerous drugs overflow the\r\nboundaries of land and the boundaries of reason.\r\nViolence employs new tactics: it has not\r\ndisappeared. Confrontations in the future may not\r\nnecessarily be wars of conquest, but bloodshed of protest.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nThe strong know that they will not be strengthened by\r\ndominating the poor, or by owning their deserts. The poor\r\ncannot, and will not, comply with their conditions, tolerated\r\nby the indifference of the well-off.\r\nExisting institutions were initiated in a different time.\r\nThey are based today on memories rather than on needs.\r\nMinistries of foreign affairs and defence were structured to\r\nconfront enemies. Now we face dangers more than\r\nenemies, but without our being organized to handle them.\r\nWe are not answering the need. Diplomacy and strategy\r\nshould be mobilized to face the undefined dangers. Disease\r\nwill not be overcome by traditional diplomatic démarches.\r\nStarvation cannot be eliminated by guns. Deserts will not\r\nbloom beneath air raids. Remedies will not arrive of their\r\nown accord: they should be invented and introduced.\r\nIsrael is on the side of this tendency. We are\r\ncommitted to ending the conflicts. We are determined to\r\nuproot their causes. We do not intend to stop this\r\nmomentum or allow its interruption.\r\nFor the last five decades the mere existence of Israel\r\nhas served as a temptation to try and destroy it. For half a\r\ncentury we had to give security top priority. To this very\r\nday, we shed tears on the tombs of our children, who paid\r\nwith their young lives to overcome the menace. When\r\nwars became futile, suspicion succeeded fighting. The\r\nallegation was that Israel was trying to expand territorially\r\nand was unwilling to compromise geographically. Reality\r\nended this allegation as well.\r\nEgypt, first to negotiate peace, found an Israel willing\r\nto exchange land for peace. The Palestinians, next in line,\r\ngained jurisdiction over territories they had never controlled\r\nbefore. With Jordan, we agreed to delineate a permanent\r\nborder without one side encroaching on the land of the\r\nother. Syria was told at the outset of negotiations that the\r\nnature of peace would affect the depth of the withdrawal.\r\nLebanon was told that Israel had no demands on its\r\nterritory and no intention of compromising its integrity.\r\nNegotiations have not been easy. With the\r\nPalestinians, we negotiated on uncharted ground. Never\r\nhad the Palestinian people experienced self-rule. Today\r\nthey possess a territorial address and an administrative\r\nauthority. For the first time in their history, their children’s\r\neducation is solely in Palestinian hands. In the coming days\r\nIsrael will hand over additional responsibilities to the\r\nPalestinian Authority. The Declaration of Principles will be\r\nfully implemented in the spirit and letter. We shall support\r\na Palestinian readiness to hold democratic elections.\r\nIsrael, as well as the Palestinians, may discover that\r\nPalestinian democracy and Israeli security are\r\ncomplementary. We have demonstrated that we are true\r\nin our moral choice not to govern the destiny of another\r\npeople.\r\nWe shall continue to negotiate with Syria. We are\r\nnegotiating out of conviction, not weakness, and we hope\r\nto conclude the negotiations with a settlement that will\r\nrespect the interests of both sides, without harming Syrian\r\ndignity or compromising Israeli security. Syria insists on\r\na narrow path for the negotiations, postponing meetings\r\nbetween the leaders and thus slowing the pace of\r\nnegotiations. Israel is ready for accelerated negotiations.\r\nWe address the Syrians by saying: \"Let us talk face to\r\nface. Let us negotiate, as proclaimed in Damascus, with\r\ncourage to attain a peace of honour. By ending suspicion,\r\nintroducing creativity and allowing flexibility, we can\r\ntransform a promising climate into a solid terrain.\" Syria\r\ndeclared its strategy for peace. We appreciate it.\r\nMilitary threats and territorial positions should be\r\ntransformed by security arrangements, diplomatic rapport,\r\nfull peace and economic endeavours. That will erode the\r\nmotivation for conflict. Without peaceful relations,\r\nbalances of power are meaningless. The range of\r\nunderstanding can serve as the only answer to the range\r\nof ballistic missiles.\r\nPresident Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher\r\nare relentlessly pushing for peace. European, Russian and\r\nmany other leaders are genuinely supportive. Important\r\nMiddle Eastern leaders are actively engaged in the same\r\ndirection. Still, much depends on direct negotiations.\r\nYesterday’s enemies, tomorrow’s partners, should become\r\ntoday’s interlocutors.\r\nA peace treaty between Israel and Syria may\r\nproduce a historic result greater than just an agreement\r\nbetween two countries. It may well become the crowning\r\nof a comprehensive peace. It may become an opportunity\r\nfor the leaders of the region - Kings, Presidents, Prime\r\nMinisters, supported by the most prominent leaders of our\r\ntime - to gather and announce the end of the conflict and\r\nto proclaim full peace throughout the region.\r\nPeace can hardly emerge from stinginess. By\r\ndefinition, it calls for generosity. Peace is more than a\r\nmere ceremony. It requires ongoing maintenance; it\r\nawaits a passionate cultivation of new relations. We hope\r\nthat our neighbours, from Saudi Arabia to Lebanon, from\r\nDjibouti to Algeria, will become constructive partners in\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nit. Dark clouds are still hanging over the horizon - the\r\nshadows of missed opportunities.\r\nWe have to build a coalition to prevent subversive\r\nturbulence from undermining legitimate Governments and\r\nharassing the stability needed for the inflow of investment.\r\nAll countries of the Middle East face a choice: to remain\r\npolitically divided and economically stagnant or to become\r\neconomically advanced and politically just.\r\nA high standard of living for the people - all people -\r\nis the best promise for stability in our midst. Israel is\r\nwilling to participate in achieving it. There are sceptics, we\r\nknow, who do not believe that the Middle East is ripe for\r\na common market similar to the European one. They forget\r\nthat Europe did not do it in one leap. It started with a\r\nCommunity of coal and steel. We can start with a\r\ncommunity of water and tourism.\r\nNor do they believe that the Middle East is ready for\r\na free trade zone like the one in North America. Yet the\r\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement emerged in a short\r\nwhile as a success by linking geographic proximity with\r\neconomic growth. Those sceptics claim that generations are\r\nneeded to cement a new market in the Middle East. Well,\r\nthey can see what in 10 short years happened to Asian\r\ncountries, which attained unpredicted prosperity. They\r\nachieved it by adopting a market economy.\r\nThe profile of a market economy is clear. It is made\r\nof comprehensive education, open borders, free movement,\r\nscience-based industries and competitive trade. A market\r\neconomy is a fabric woven from political silk and durable\r\nthreads of welfare. The time is ripe for its rendezvous with\r\nthe Middle East.\r\nAt the end of October, under the presidency of King\r\nHassan II, we shall take the first step to implement a\r\nregional design. We shall try to establish instruments for\r\ndevelopment: a regional bank, channels for private\r\ninvestment and a framework for regional planning. The\r\nwealth of the Middle East should be convinced to remain\r\nat home. Over the last decade it has invested the better\r\npart of its fortunes abroad. Homebound wealth will attract\r\nforeign investment as well.\r\nWe should cut the enormous expense - $70 billion\r\nannually - of the arms race. The savings can be directed to\r\ndevelopment. The arms race can be reduced only by\r\nregional consent. No single country will do it alone.\r\nTo transform the region and make it a stable and\r\nattractive place we need the emergence of the region as\r\na whole, committed to a new future. Nature, and not\r\nonly politics, calls for it. The waters, the winds, the\r\nenvironment call for regional responsibility and\r\ncooperation, for desalinization plants, energy stations,\r\nhighways, railways, runways, piers, telecommunication\r\nnetworks, high-tech industries, tourism infrastructure,\r\nbanking systems, computer terminals and ecological\r\nconsiderations - a landscape that will meet the future will\r\ncreate a state of prosperity, and it is a regional challenge.\r\nThe Middle East was the cradle of civilization and\r\nhas a capacity to contribute. It experienced golden ages,\r\neconomically and culturally. It should be our collective\r\nambition to make it happen again and to make it happen\r\nsoon. Today, shortages can be bridged rapidly.\r\nComputers can carry children not only from grade to\r\ngrade but from age to age. The software of knowledge\r\nwill better replace the hardware of weapons.\r\nI have served my country since its birth. I have\r\nlearned that complex problems call for unconventional\r\nsolutions. I feel that over the past year we have won a\r\nlicence to build a new Middle East, to make it part of the\r\nglobe in its new age, free of wars, free of enemies, free\r\nof terrorism; a Middle East which will be nuclear-free,\r\nmissile-free, hunger-free, discrimination-free, tyranny-free;\r\na constituency of peace, a domain of freedom, a land of\r\nprosperity. There is a morning awaiting us after a long\r\nnight, calling us to direct our energies and our aims and\r\nour prayers towards that great opportunity.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdellatif Filali, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco.\r\nMr. Abdellatif Filali, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom\r\nof Morocco, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nKingdom of Morocco, His Excellency Mr. Abdellatif Filali,\r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Filali (Morocco) (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nam pleased to extend to you, Sir, my sincere\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly and to express\r\nto you my great delight at seeing you, a distinguished\r\nfriend from a sisterly country, conducting the work of this\r\nsession.\r\nYour competence and great diplomatic experience are\r\nassets which ensure the success of our deliberations. We\r\nare convinced that, through you, Africa will bring to this\r\nsession its well-known capabilities and talents in order to\r\nsecure the best results for our work. Allow me to assure\r\nyou of the full cooperation of the delegation of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to His Excellency\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Republic of Guyana and President of\r\nthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, for the\r\nlaudable work he accomplished.\r\nI should like also to express to our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, my sincere regards and\r\nappreciation for his untiring efforts in upholding the\r\nprinciples of the Charter and for the wisdom and the\r\nperspicacity with which he faces the increasing\r\nresponsibilities assigned to the United Nations in recent\r\nyears.\r\nThe end of the cold war gave the peoples of the world\r\ncause for hope that they were about to see the dawn of a\r\nnew era in international relations, an era of democracy,\r\njustice and an effective international solidarity which would\r\ntake into account the interests of all.\r\nYears after that historic opportunity, we have come to\r\nrealize that our optimism was unjustified. We are to see\r\nyet any sincere international effort towards the creation of\r\na new world order and of the hoped-for peace dividends we\r\nhave seen nothing concrete yet. On the contrary, what we\r\nsee now makes us fear that that historic opportunity is on\r\nthe verge of being dissipated in the fog of an ambiguous\r\ninternational political atmosphere.\r\nA close examination of the characteristics of the\r\npresent world order reveals that its thrust focuses almost\r\ntotally on the issues of economic openness, freedom of\r\ninternational trade, democracy and human rights.\r\nThere is no doubt that these two last questions\r\ndeserve every attention, since they are among the\r\nunderpinnings of any system of honest government and of\r\nsocial justice and have always been among the goals of\r\nenlightened civilizations in their search for a fair society\r\nin which justice and social peace may prevail.\r\nMaybe it would be going too far to insist, as some\r\ndo, on the adoption of one model of democracy, out of all\r\nthe other models, by all the countries and societies of the\r\nworld without taking into account the numerous factors\r\nwhich have to do with the civilizations of the peoples of\r\nthose countries, their customs, traditions, cultures, the\r\ndegree of their development, their general conception of\r\nthe universe we live in, or their views concerning life and\r\nsociety.\r\nAs regards our Organization, the principles of\r\ndemocracy require us to examine its methods of operation\r\nin order to secure a unified implementation of its\r\nresolutions and ensure efficiency in the discharge of its\r\nduties.\r\nIn view of the ever-increasing importance of the role\r\nthe Security Council now plays in international affairs, we\r\nmust debate the extent of its adaptation to the great\r\nchanges that have taken place in the world recently and\r\nwhich have affected the balance of power, side by side\r\nwith the new political and economic trends, so that we\r\nmay find consensus solutions in reviewing the Security\r\nCouncil’s methods of work and in trying to enhance its\r\nefficacy.\r\nThe changes I have spoken of require us to review\r\nalso some of the provisions of the Charter with a view to\r\nenabling our Organization to face up to the new\r\ninternational challenges with the participation of all in the\r\ninterests of all.\r\nAs for the question of human rights, the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco attaches great importance to those rights, which\r\nare enshrined in our constitution. However, I wish to\r\npoint out - as I did in past years - that human rights have\r\ndifferent aspects which must be respected fully. We\r\nshould not focus solely on the political aspect whose\r\nimportance has been established. The rights of the human\r\nbeing to the essential, basic human needs such as food,\r\nclothing, medicine and shelter are inalienable and\r\nfundamental, just exactly as the right to life. That is why\r\nthe World Conference on Human Rights, which was\r\nconvened in Vienna last year, determined that economic\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\ndevelopment which makes it possible to satisfy those needs\r\nwas a fundamental human right.\r\nConsequently, the affluent nations have an obligation\r\nto pay more attention to the economic interests of the\r\ndeveloping world in order to help it reach the levels of\r\ndevelopment that will allow it to accord to those rights the\r\npriority they deserve.\r\nIn this context, we expect the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, which will take place in Copenhagen\r\nnext year, to define the essential needs of man the\r\nsatisfaction of which would guarantee a decent life and\r\nexpect the Summit to set up a plan of action to stimulate\r\nsocial development and economic progress in the countries\r\nof the third world.\r\nThe world has entered upon a new era marked by\r\nfundamental changes in the traditional international relations\r\nwhich emphasized the primacy of political beliefs. In\r\naddition, the great Powers have engaged in a new race for\r\neconomic interests in place of the arms race. The race that\r\nnow concerns them is characterized by the strengthening of\r\nrelations within great economic groupings with a view to\r\nthe creation of new economic blocs. These developments\r\nwill undoubtedly alter the economic and political map of\r\nthe world and will, thereby, widen the gap between the\r\ndeveloped and the developing countries.\r\nIn a much more interdependent world, thanks to the\r\nnew means of communication and technology, such as live\r\ntelevision broadcasts, it has become ever more difficult to\r\npersuade the peoples of the developing countries to be\r\ncontent with their lot while the disparities between the\r\naffluence of the developed countries and the misery of the\r\ndeveloping countries are constantly worsening. Therefore,\r\nit would be illogical to expect that lasting peace and\r\nsecurity could prevail in a world wherein the overwhelming\r\nmajority of people live in despair, deprivation and social\r\nmisery.\r\nThe rich countries should find satisfactory solutions to\r\nthe economic problems of developing countries - in\r\nparticular, to those related to the deterioration in terms of\r\ntrade, the decline in commodity prices, external\r\nindebtedness and technological weaknesses.\r\nIn April 1994, the city of Marrakech hosted the\r\nsigning of various agreements under the General Agreement\r\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Through these agreements,\r\nthe international community established the primacy of the\r\nrule of law in international economic and trade relations\r\nand put an end to the law of the primacy of strength that\r\nprevailed in the past.\r\nThe agreements, which were signed by 109 States,\r\nincluded a number of extremely positive elements. One\r\nof the most significant results of the Marrakech\r\nagreements was the creation of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, which will come into being next year and\r\nwill have competence in the areas of control and\r\nimplementation. We hope that this new organization,\r\nthanks to its competences, the policies laid for it, and the\r\nprogramme of work designed to pursue those policies will\r\nbe able to lay real foundations for international trade that\r\nwould free trade from the protectionism that plagues it\r\nunder many guises such as the so-called social\r\nconsiderations that relate to workers’ rights and\r\nenvironmental considerations.\r\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War and the\r\nsetting up of the United Nations, international relations\r\nhave been characterized essentially by the movement\r\ntowards the liberation of peoples from the colonial yoke,\r\nespecially in Africa and Asia. Nowadays, only some\r\nenclaves remain from the colonial era. For particular\r\nreasons, those enclaves required more time for their\r\nliberation, and they are now involved in settlement\r\nprocesses with the agreement of the interested parties.\r\nThe British colony of Hong Kong will revert to\r\nChinese sovereignty in 1997, as will the Portuguese\r\ncolony of Macau in the near future. Similarly, the status\r\nof Gibraltar is the subject of continuous discussions\r\nbetween Spain and the United Kingdom with a view to\r\nthe return of that Territory to Spanish sovereignty. These\r\nare settlement processes that we in Morocco strongly\r\nsupport.\r\nAs we know, some enclaves in the northern part of\r\nMorocco are still under Spanish control. These are the\r\ncities of Sebta and Melilia and the neighbouring islands.\r\nSince its accession to independence, my country has\r\ntirelessly asked Spain to return those enclaves so that we\r\nmay restore our territorial integrity and put an end to this\r\nlong-standing dispute.\r\nThere is no doubt the ideal solution in this respect\r\nwould be to follow the same procedure that was adopted\r\nin the case of each of the territories I have just\r\nmentioned, namely, dialogue, natural understanding and\r\nharking to the voice of wisdom by heeding the logic of\r\nour time and taking into account the interests of both\r\nparties.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nWe believe that the Moroccan-Spanish group proposed\r\nby His Majesty King Hassan II to reflect and consult on\r\nthat question is the best framework within which it would\r\nbe possible to reach a settlement that may safeguard the\r\nsovereign rights of Morocco and, at the same time, allows\r\nSpain to protect its economic interests.\r\nWe are convinced that the historic ties of civilization\r\nbetween Morocco and Spain as well as our relations of\r\ngood-neighbourliness and our fruitful cooperation in several\r\nareas will make it possible to overcome the difficulties that\r\nlie in the way of the settlement of this dispute.\r\nThe freeing of relations between Morocco and Spain\r\nfrom the remnants of the past is a matter of significant\r\nimportance in view of the fact that both countries belong to\r\nthe Mediterranean region, that sensitive part of the world\r\nwhich should be a region of cooperation, stability and\r\nsolidarity.\r\nIn this context, we are convinced that the prosperity\r\nand security of Europe and particularly of its Mediterranean\r\ncountries could not be fully achieved without genuine\r\nefforts to contribute to the development of the southern\r\nMediterranean countries. We are also convinced that this\r\nwill be achieved only through the eradication of the existing\r\ngap between the countries of the two sides of the\r\nMediterranean and the establishment of a multifaceted\r\ncooperation that would be inspired by a comprehensive\r\nvision of the concept of cooperation and anchored in the\r\nwill of both sides to enter into a partnership that may\r\nprovide a solid foundation for the prosperity and stability of\r\nthe region.\r\nProceeding from this conviction, the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco proposed to the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe at its fourth session held in\r\nDecember 1993 in Rome, the convening of a ministerial\r\nmeeting to address the issues of security and cooperation in\r\nthe Mediterranean region in which all the Mediterranean\r\ncountries as well as all other countries interested in the\r\nfuture of that sensitive region would participate in order to\r\nconsult over the various issues and problems that face the\r\nregion. We do hope that the proposal will gain the support\r\nof the countries concerned.\r\nAlong with our brethren from the countries of the\r\nArab Maghreb, Morocco has made sustained efforts aimed\r\nat securing the unity of the region and ensuring the coming\r\nto being of the institutions of such unity.\r\nHowever, it is no secret to anyone that the\r\nachievement of the desired unity still faces certain\r\ndifficulties regardless of all that has been accomplished so\r\nfar at the institutional, structural and regulatory levels.\r\nNevertheless, it is the conviction of all concerned that the\r\nsetting up of that edifice will benefit all the people of the\r\nregion and will open up great vistas in the areas of\r\ndevelopment and progress.\r\nIt is obvious that the pace of progress towards the\r\nachievement of the desired objectives is rather slow at the\r\ntime. However, my country remains prompted by a\r\nsincere determination and by a firm will to overcome\r\nthose difficulties, in the conviction that its future and that\r\nof the countries of the region depend to a great extent on\r\nthe achievement of such unity and solidarity amongst\r\nthem. In all this, there is the awareness that the ties of\r\ncommon heritage, of common history, of culture, of\r\nlanguage and of religion bind all our peoples together.\r\nWith regard to the so-called question of Western\r\nSahara, the United Nations settlement plan has entered the\r\nfinal stage of implementation. The Kingdom of Morocco\r\nhas cooperated sincerely with the Secretary-General, as\r\nattested to in the Secretary-General’s reports, with a view\r\nto facilitating his mission and speeding up the ongoing\r\nprocess. Therefore, we look forward with optimism to\r\nthe holding of the referendum within the next few\r\nmonths.\r\nThe past decade was one of the most disastrous for\r\nthe African continent in economic and in social terms.\r\nThe limited international effort provided to assist the\r\ncontinent has not yielded any improvement so far. As a\r\nmatter of fact, standards of living in many sub-Saharan\r\ncountries continue to worsen as the per capita income\r\ncontinues to decline while the growth rate of the gross\r\nnational product dropped to less than 1.5 per cent at a\r\ntime when the population grows at a much greater rate.\r\nThus the overall economic situation in Africa has\r\nfallen to a level below the one recorded in the seventies.\r\nBecause of such constant deterioration and the\r\nmarginalization from which Africa suffers, partial and\r\ntemporary solutions cannot satisfy us. Exceptional\r\ninternational efforts should be undertaken and drastic\r\nsolutions designed to remedy to the situation.\r\nOn the occasion of the holding of the historic\r\nmeeting of Marrakech, in the context of the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Agreements,\r\nHis Majesty the King has called upon the leaders of the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nworld to integrate the economy of Africa in the global\r\neconomy and urged the elaboration of a Marshall Plan with\r\na view to reducing poverty and alleviating the suffering of\r\nmillions of human beings in our continent.\r\nAs an African country, the Kingdom of Morocco\r\ncontinues to do its utmost in assisting sisterly countries in\r\nthe sub-Saharan region by all the means at its disposal. In\r\nfact, my country channels 90 per cent of the funds it\r\nallocates to international cooperation to the assistance of\r\nsisterly African countries.\r\nDuring the month of April 1994, the African scene\r\nwitnessed an important event, namely, the victory of\r\ndemocratic forces, the forces of peace and freedom, against\r\nthe forces of racial discrimination. Thus, South Africa’s\r\nfirst free elections in which all segments of its people\r\nparticipated have resulted in the election of Mr. Nelson\r\nMandela to the presidency of the Republic.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco had earlier expressed its\r\nsatisfaction at those decisive developments, which ended a\r\nhalf-century-long conflict and allowed South Africa, a sister\r\ncountry, to usher in a new era of national harmony and\r\ndemocracy and give it reason to look forward to a\r\nprosperous future for all its people. My country made its\r\ncontribution by giving an impetus to the reconciliation\r\nprocess through meeting with and offering encouragement\r\nto Presidents Mandela and De Klerk, both known for their\r\nwisdom and clearsightedness.\r\nWe were one of the first countries to establish\r\ndiplomatic relations with the new South Africa - more than\r\ntwo years ago now - and we will make every effort to\r\nstrengthen the basis of our cooperation with that country,\r\nwhich, to our great satisfaction, has taken back its rightful\r\nplace within the United Nations. We have no doubt that\r\nSouth Africa will greatly and positively contribute to the\r\nenrichment and effectiveness of the work of our\r\nOrganization and to the well-being of the entire African\r\ncontinent.\r\nOne year after the signing in Washington of the\r\nDeclaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government\r\nArrangements in Gaza and Jericho, between the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and Israel, we note today that the\r\npeace process in the Middle East is moving along at a\r\nsteady pace, thus giving rise to some optimism for the first\r\ntime in the last 50 years.\r\nIn spite of the hindrances and obstacles it faces from\r\ntime to time, this agreement is being effectively and\r\npractically implemented. We hope that this encouraging\r\nstart will continue and will include all the occupied\r\nPalestinian territory, and that it will result in the transfer\r\nof all powers to the Palestinian National Authority to\r\npave the way for a comprehensive solution that would\r\ngrant the totality of its legitimate rights to the Palestinian\r\npeople, including the creation of an independent State\r\nwith Al-Quds as its capital, in accordance with the United\r\nNations resolutions.\r\nIt was only natural that the Palestinian self-\r\ngovernment experience should face initial difficulties and\r\nexperience sensitive beginnings. We hope that the States\r\nmembers of the international community that have\r\nfollowed this issue for decades and that supported the\r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people throughout its different\r\nstages will not fail to grant all the necessary material aid\r\nand assistance to the Palestinian National Authority\r\nduring this delicate period, in order to help it build its\r\nnational institutions and its economic structures, and to\r\nensure the success of this experience.\r\nSimilarly, Jordan and Israel have signed an\r\nagreement recently in Washington. However, the advent\r\nof peace and security in that region will always depend\r\non the achievement of a comprehensive solution, which\r\nwould guarantee the recovery of Syrian and Lebanese\r\nterritories, in conformity with international legality and in\r\nparticular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\r\n(1973) and 425 (1978).\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, convinced of the virtues\r\nof dialogue and concerted action among the parties to the\r\nArab Israeli conflict, was one of the first to recommend\r\nand promote this approach as the ideal means for the\r\nsettlement of disputes. My country strongly believes that\r\nthe logic of war and violence does not lead to permanent\r\nsolutions. That is why we feel a great deal of satisfaction\r\ntoday as we see the parties in the Middle East engaging\r\nin a constructive dialogue to achieve an agreement that\r\nwould put paid to conflicts and tragedies and usher in a\r\nnew era of peace, cooperation and well-being in the\r\nregion’s history.\r\nIn order to encourage peace efforts and to make the\r\nArab world benefit from their dividends, Morocco will\r\nhost next month, in Casablanca, an Economic Conference\r\nfor the Middle East and North Africa. Highly placed\r\ngovernment officials, and businessmen as well as\r\nfinancial and economic experts will participate in the\r\nConference. This gathering will aim at setting the rules\r\nfor boosting the economy and development in the two\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nregions, and at creating economic programmes based on\r\npartnership for the benefit of the countries of the two\r\nregions and their peoples.\r\nRegarding the dispute between Iran and the United\r\nArab Emirates, we hope that the two countries, which are\r\nmembers of the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\r\nwill resort to dialogue to resolve their dispute over the\r\nfuture of the islands of Abu Moussa and the Greater and\r\nthe Lesser Tumbs. The historic and friendly relations\r\nbetween the two peoples, which allowed them to coexist\r\nunder United Arab Emirates sovereignty on Abu Moussa\r\nisland, should enable them to return to normal relations.\r\nContemporary history has known few tragedies\r\ncomparable to the one being experienced by the people of\r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who have been,\r\nand still are, subjected to all kinds of collective\r\npunishments, massacres, \"ethnic cleansing\", displacement,\r\nconfiscation of property, destruction of places of worship\r\nand demolition of cultural monuments. The inability of the\r\ninternational community and of the United Nations in\r\nparticular to put an end to these outrageous criminal acts\r\nand their inability to uphold the principles of international\r\nlaw, which is violated daily by Serbian practices, is\r\nintolerable and unacceptable.\r\nOur Organization will celebrate next year its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. The period that has elapsed since its inception\r\nhas known many activities and accomplishments but also\r\nsome failures and setbacks. As regards its\r\naccomplishments, one should underline its sustained action\r\nto liberate peoples from the colonial yoke and to assist\r\nthem in obtaining their political independence, as well as\r\nits activities aiming at the settlement of many conflicts by\r\npeaceful means and the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security through, inter alia, peace-keeping\r\noperations. Its specialized institutions and agencies have\r\nalso made considerable contributions through their great\r\nefforts in social, health and cultural matters.\r\nHowever, our Organization has been unable to\r\naccomplish some tasks entrusted to it by the Charter. I\r\nrefer in particular to economic and development issues.\r\nNo large-scale action has been taken to help developing\r\ncountries in particular achieve economic development,\r\ndespite the efforts and the many meetings devoted to this\r\nquestion.\r\nThis fiftieth anniversary will take place in an\r\ninternational environment that is totally different from the\r\none that followed the Second World War. Our\r\nOrganization must adapt to this change by exploring the\r\nprospects of the twenty-first century, of which we are on\r\nthe threshold.\r\nTo this end, several ideas have been put forward\r\nwith the aim of strengthening our Organization, reforming\r\nits structures and affording it the means whereby it could\r\nmeet the new and increasing demands made upon it in\r\nmany areas. In short, the aim is to enable the\r\nOrganization to satisfy the current needs of the\r\ninternational community. The Secretary-General’s report\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" appeared at the right moment to\r\nshow us the appropriate means by which the organs of the\r\nUnited Nations might serve international peace and\r\nsecurity. The report also introduced new ideas\r\nconcerning preventive diplomacy with the aim of\r\npreventing the eruption of new conflicts and dealt with\r\nthe issues of building and maintaining peace, as well as\r\nmany other issues, and put forth proposals which we are\r\nsure will improve the functioning of our Organization.\r\nThere is no doubt that the fiftieth anniversary\r\ncelebrations will be an opportunity for many world\r\nleaders and other high officials that are rich in experience\r\nto rethink the future of our Organization in order to\r\nenable it to meet the highest aspirations of mankind in the\r\ntwenty-first century: to live in peace and security, in\r\nsocial justice and human dignity.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall upon the Minister for Foreign Relations of Panama,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Gabriel Lewis Galindo.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nMr. Lewis Galindo (Panama) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): First of all allow me to say how pleased we are\r\nat your election as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session. Since you are such an eminent\r\nstatesman, we are certain that this session will be a\r\nresounding success. We hail the work accomplished by\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who presided\r\nover the recently concluded session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are grateful to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization, for the fine job he\r\nis doing, reflecting his constant concern with helping to\r\nbuild a more just and progressive world society on the basis\r\nof the purposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter.\r\nThis past May, the Panamanian people completed an\r\nirreproachable electoral process. The results now make it\r\npossible for us to undertake the democratic reconstruction\r\nof the State, with broad-based and cooperative participation\r\nby all of Panama’s various social groupings.\r\nThis has made it possible for us to develop promising\r\nnew relations of understanding and cooperation with the\r\nGovernment of the United States, grounded in a common\r\nresolve to fulfil on schedule the timetable established by the\r\nTorrijos-Carter Treaties on the Panama Canal and\r\nassociated territories. Furthermore, we are seeking to\r\nextend our relations, as partners and friends of the United\r\nStates, into fields that will facilitate the solution of regional\r\nand world problems affecting the stability of areas of\r\ncommon interest to both nations. With maturity, and an\r\nintense sense of dignity and patriotism, the Government of\r\nPanama is embarking on a new era in our relations with the\r\nUnited States.\r\nThus these Treaties today are becoming once more for\r\nour two nations what we intended them to be when they\r\nwere signed 17 years ago: the feasibility of a great Power\r\nand a small country working together, peacefully, to\r\nachieve mutually beneficial results on matters that\r\npreviously gave rise to confrontation. Furthermore, this is\r\nin keeping with the principles of international law and gives\r\nus all new cause for hope concerning the new era the world\r\nis now seeking to establish.\r\nMs. Arystanbekova (Kazakhstan), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nPursuant to those Treaties, the Government headed by\r\nMr. Ernesto Pérez Balladares intends in a responsible\r\nmanner to put into effect the timetable of reversion to\r\nPanama of all the lands, waters and installations that form\r\nthe Canal and its contiguous area. Similarly, we intend to\r\nensure full demilitarization of the waterway and,\r\nconsequently, we are planning as of now the prompt\r\nconversion of the foreign military installations there into\r\nindustrial and trading posts of international interest, whose\r\noperations will be carried out just a few scant yards from\r\nthe vessels that pass through day by day, heading towards\r\nall points of the compass.\r\nThe decisions we have taken will ensure that this\r\nstrip of territory will become one of the most attractive\r\nareas for investment in the Atlantic, the Americas, and the\r\nPacific Basin.\r\nDespite Panama’s intense economic and cultural\r\nenergy, it is a small country. Hence developing this\r\nproject will require international cooperation. In the short\r\nterm, the new Panamanian Government intends to\r\ncoordinate this cooperation in order to take the best\r\npossible advantage of a tremendous potential.\r\nIn this context, we shall convene in 1997 the World\r\nCongress on the Panama Canal to commemorate the\r\ntwentieth anniversary of the signing of the Torrijos-Carter\r\nTreaties. This event will bring together the users of the\r\nCanal and the potential users of the associated facilities -\r\nshipbuilders, industrialists, financiers, technical experts,\r\nplanners and leaders of higher education - to consider the\r\nscope and orchestration of the entire development project\r\nfor the Panama Canal and the Panamanian nation.\r\nThis Congress will also be an arena for the display\r\nof technology-, media- and communications-related\r\nproducts, as well as for interoceanic and intercontinental\r\ntrade. It will therefore be of particular importance in\r\ngauging the scope of the new world trend which we now\r\ncall \"globalization\". For this reason, we intend to plan\r\nthis Congress with the cooperation of the United Nations\r\nas well as that of the two countries which, in their time,\r\nwere engaged in the construction of the Canal - France\r\nand the United States.\r\nThere is another facet to this situation, however. We\r\nPanamanians have convincingly proved our ability to\r\nefficiently administer and operate the existing Canal; we\r\nshall demonstrate this once again at the World Congress.\r\nYet we wish to make further use of these skills, and this\r\ndesire forms the basis for the projects tied in with the\r\ncurrent, final phase of implementation of the Torrijos-\r\nCarter Treaties: by this, I mean the international\r\nuniversity conglomerate that we call the \"Ciudad del\r\nSaber\", \"the City of Knowledge\". In this area, and with\r\nthe excellent infrastructure facilities that will soon revert\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nto Panama, we can bring together, in the best possible\r\nphysical environment, faculties and departments of the\r\nmajor universities interested in studying subjects related to\r\nthe next century and its prospects - subjects such as\r\ncommunications and telecommunications, naval and air\r\ntransport, computer technology, international trade, the\r\nenvironment and sustainable development, as well as\r\neconomic and business relations between our Americas and\r\nthe Pacific basin.\r\nThus conceived, the City of Knowledge will replace\r\nmilitary bases and foreign soldiers with an international\r\nconglomerate of universities and a great army of students\r\nand teachers from all corners of the world. This will be the\r\nbest possible way to celebrate the end of the cold war and\r\nthe development of new world circumstances, while at the\r\nsame time making the new era accessible to many\r\nthousands of our young people. We are certain that this\r\nproject will receive the necessary international cooperation\r\nand the support of the United Nations system.\r\nThere is another issue of similar, worldwide interest\r\nthat deserves the attention of this forum. Although it is an\r\ninteroceanic passageway, the Panama Canal is fed\r\nexclusively by fresh water. For this reason, its existence,\r\nthe quality of its services and the possibility of expanding\r\nthem depend on the renewal of its forests and the attention\r\nto the environment that is indispensable to feeding its basin,\r\nguaranteeing the water supply and making it possible for\r\nthe Canal to operate.\r\nThis basin has suffered disturbing deterioration, which,\r\nshould it continue, could jeopardize the services provided\r\nto the world by the Canal. Conscious of its responsibilities,\r\nour country has begun a series of national and international\r\nconsultations with a view to devising a campaign that\r\nwould secure the technical and financial resources needed\r\nto ensure the environmental conditions required for the\r\nimprovement and optimal use of the Canal. This campaign\r\ncould perhaps serve as a symbol of international\r\ncooperation in ensuring appropriate use of resources\r\nnecessary to mankind.\r\nOur country has recently rejoined the Rio Group - of\r\nwhich we were one of the initial promoters - as a full\r\nmember. With respect to foreign policy, we fully concur\r\nwith the purposes, declarations and agreements adopted by\r\nthis group.\r\nWe Panamanians are sincerely resolved to expand our\r\npolitical dialogue and economic cooperation with\r\nneighbouring countries. To this end, we are pursuing the\r\nprocess of integration with the countries of Central\r\nAmerica in all ways that can be mutually beneficial.\r\nBecause of its history and traditions, as well as for\r\nreasons of geographical proximity and economic affinity,\r\nPanama will be promoting links and integration with its\r\nSouth American neighbours, with which it shares the\r\nideals of Bolivar.\r\nAt the same time, the great trading opportunities\r\nafforded us as a result of the reversion of the Panama\r\nCanal and its adjacent areas make it incumbent on us to\r\nstrengthen our links with the countries of the Pacific\r\nbasin, and to work together on projects and activities of\r\nmutual benefit.\r\nFor similar reasons, Panama, which already has a\r\nspecial relationship with the United States - a relationship\r\nthat is taking on special significance today - intends to\r\nseek membership in the North American Free Trade\r\nAssociation, whose current members, Canada, the United\r\nStates and Mexico, are certain to play a significant role in\r\nensuring the best possible use of the Canal areas that will\r\nrevert to Panama.\r\nIn recent times, the international community has\r\nnoted symptoms of repeated crises in certain parts of the\r\nCaribbean area. Indeed, on certain specific conditions,\r\nPanama has offered parts of its national territory to help\r\nprovide a temporary solution to the problem of the\r\nHaitian and Cuban raft and boat people. This gesture has\r\nbeen motivated solely by humanitarian considerations,\r\nwithout political or diplomatic implications. We shall\r\ncontinue to act in this manner, especially when it is useful\r\nin providing a grace period during which a peaceful, and\r\nagreed solution to the underlying causes of these\r\nproblems may be found.\r\nIn the case of Haiti, my Government is particularly\r\ngratified that an agreement was reached which allowed\r\nfor the landing of multinational forces in accordance with\r\nthe relevant Security Council resolution and without the\r\ntrauma of an invasion by force. We believe, none the\r\nless, that Haiti’s problems will be solved only when all\r\naspects of the Security Council resolution are fully\r\nimplemented and, in terms of socio-economic issues,\r\nprovided the international community helps eradicate the\r\ncauses of the poverty and backwardness which persist\r\nthere.\r\nWith respect to the situation in the fraternal Republic\r\nof Cuba, we believe that the causes underlying the\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nconflict must be addressed. For this reason, my\r\nGovernment favours reforms which, through the exercise of\r\nself-determination, would guarantee the establishment of a\r\nmulti-party democracy there. Furthermore, my Government\r\nis in favour of lifting the economic embargo that is such a\r\nburden on that country. Only by acting simultaneously on\r\nboth fronts will it be possible to overcome this crisis. We\r\nare fully ready to assist the fraternal Caribbean nation of\r\nCuba.\r\nWith the conclusion of the cold war, the world is\r\nfocusing most of its attention on other problems, new and\r\nold, which now make up the world agenda - problems such\r\nas the current restructuring of systems of economic\r\nrelations and international politics.\r\nIt must be stressed that in the handling of the\r\nphenomena known as \"globalization\", it is vital to establish\r\na new order which will take into account the realities,\r\ninterests, sovereign rights, and just aspirations of the small\r\ncountries and the developing nations in general. Any\r\ndevelopment which, out of selfishness, indifference,\r\ninattention, or the like, fails to meet this requirement, will\r\ninevitably condemn us to a world riddled with yet further\r\nimbalance, marginalization and instability.\r\nMankind’s hopes for the twenty-first century will be\r\nrealized only if together we are able to build a much fairer,\r\nmore equitable and more balanced future. This applies to\r\nall countries, be they rich or poor, weak or strong.\r\nSpecifically, such a future requires that we embark\r\nimmediately on a vigorous programme of common and\r\ncoordinated actions to eradicate mankind’s greatest\r\nproblem: poverty. Panama declares again today, before the\r\nAssembly, that it is willing to join the international\r\nprogrammes to combat poverty and promote solidarity and\r\nsocial equity, as well as those aimed at promoting a better\r\nquality of life for the sectors that are most deprived and\r\nleast fairly treated. In particular, Panama will commit itself\r\nto efforts to improve the social situation of the family and\r\nof women and children.\r\nIn respect of this universal aspiration, women in\r\nPanama have already attained positions of relative\r\nimportance in both political and professional arenas.\r\nToday, for the first time in the history of our Republic, the\r\ndeserving President of our legislative organ is a woman\r\nwho is a popular leader, while in our last elections another\r\nprominent female politician was a candidate for the\r\npresidency of the Republic of Panama, and she now leads\r\nthe major opposition party. We are also proud to see\r\nPanamanian professional women serving in the Cabinet of\r\nMr. Ernesto Pérez Balladares and as judges on our\r\nSupreme Court of Justice. In short, women in Panama\r\nplay a leading and powerful role in all aspects of our\r\npolitical and private life, and they are often at the\r\nforefront of our technical, scientific and professional\r\ndevelopment. For this reason we shall continue to\r\nsupport actions that make it possible for women to\r\nachieve full and effective equality of rights and\r\nopportunities in an increasingly competitive world.\r\nOn another question, my country has decided to\r\ntackle firmly and unequivocally the problems of drug-\r\ntrafficking, money-laundering and terrorism. We are\r\ncurrently devising a strategy to combat these terrible evils\r\nthat imperil the very existence of our nations. We favour\r\nthe development of joint, coordinated action on the\r\ninternational level. The community of nations faces a\r\ngreat challenge in these grave problems, and we fervently\r\nappeal to the Governments and the peoples of Latin\r\nAmerica to create a powerful organization to combat\r\nthem.\r\nIn another area, Panama is particularly attentive to\r\nthe discussions aimed at defining a new role for the\r\nUnited Nations and the corresponding structural reforms\r\nthis world Organization requires. With regard specifically\r\nto the structure of the United Nations, Panama believes it\r\nis necessary to increase the representativity of its most\r\nimportant decision-making bodies. In particular, my\r\ncountry believes that the Security Council must be\r\nenlarged. Panama wishes to reiterate that, whatever\r\napproach is taken, Latin America’s participation in that\r\nbody should be increased and Latin American countries\r\nshould be given consideration as possible permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nI am pleased to state that the new democratic\r\nGovernment of Panama fully accepts the commitment to\r\nbolster and enhance its presence in international agencies,\r\nwhere it is a Latin American and Caribbean voice that\r\nremains faithful to the rightful aspirations of the\r\ndeveloping countries. This decision is reflected in the\r\nspeech delivered by Ernesto Pérez Balladares when he\r\nwas sworn in as my country’s President. He said:\r\n\"This is the new face that Panama is showing to its\r\nfriends abroad. We are no longer at the stage of\r\nseeking solidarity on the Canal Treaty in order to\r\nregain the benefits of our geographic position. Now\r\nwe want to begin our participation in the new world\r\nthat is challenging us all and to make known the\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\npotentialities of our geographic position, our desire to\r\ntake advantage of all opportunities properly, fairly and\r\nrespectfully, in the pursuit of an aggressive foreign\r\npolicy free of complexes and capable of helping us\r\nsurmount the challenges of the next century. We are\r\nfriends to all. We are foes of none.\"\r\nWe look with optimism on the development of\r\nmankind and, in particular, that of my country. We will\r\npass the baton to our young people on our country’s path\r\nof progress, peace and justice.\r\nFinally, on this occasion I also take pleasure in\r\nwishing you, Mr. President, every success in your task of\r\nleading the General Assembly.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
