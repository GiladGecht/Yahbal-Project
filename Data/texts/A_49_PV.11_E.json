(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.40 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Heydar Alirza ogly Aliyev, President of\r\nthe Azerbaijani Republic\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nAzerbaijani Republic.\r\nMr. Heydar Alirza ogly Aliyev, President of the\r\nAzerbaijani Republic, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nAzerbaijani Republic, His Excellency Mr. Heydar Alirza\r\nogly Aliyev, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Aliyev (interpretation from Russian):\r\nAllow me, first, to express my sincere satisfaction on the\r\noccasion of your election, Sir, as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session and to wish you every\r\nsuccess in your work.\r\nI should like also to thank the President of the last\r\nsession, Mr. Samuel Insanally, for the work he did.\r\nI express my deep gratitude to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts to\r\nstrengthen peace and security throughout the world. I\r\nshould like to extend to him my very special appreciation,\r\nespecially for his keen interest in the problems of our\r\nyoung State, which is going through a complicated period\r\nof its history.\r\nIt is with a sense of excitement and pride that I am\r\naddressing this Assembly from the podium of the most\r\nauthoritative international forum. For the first time, the\r\nPresident of an independent Azerbaijan is representing his\r\ncountry before the international community, a country that\r\nhas been recognized by this community and has joined it\r\nas an equal among equals.\r\nThe Azerbaijani people have striven for freedom for\r\ncenturies. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union\r\nthey gained their national independence. Our Republic\r\nhas embarked upon the road of constructing a law-based,\r\ndemocratic and civilized State. This is a complicated\r\nprocess; it cannot be completed overnight, but we are\r\nsteadily moving towards our goal. During a short period\r\nof time a great deal has been accomplished, and all the\r\nconditions have been created for the formation of a\r\nlaw-based, democratic society. We have evolved in our\r\nRepublic a multi-party system, firmly based on the\r\nprinciples of political pluralism and freedom of the\r\nindividual, speech, the press and conscience, as well as\r\nprinciples of respect for human rights and the rule of law.\r\nAll citizens of multinational Azerbaijan enjoy equal\r\nrights, irrespective of their racial, religious and linguistic\r\naffiliations.\r\nPolitical changes and the democratization of the\r\ncountry have created the conditions for carrying out deep\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\neconomic reforms, ensuring a transition to a market\r\neconomy. We fully encourage the development of free\r\nenterprise and private initiative. We are on the way to\r\nrealizing a large-scale privatization programme, using world\r\nexperience based upon common human values - on the\r\nexperience of leading countries that have already achieved\r\ngreat success in constructing civilized, prosperous and\r\ndemocratic societies.\r\nLocated at the important geopolitical junction of\r\nEurope and Asia and the focus of the keen interest of many\r\nPowers, possessing rich natural resources and a substantial\r\nindustrial potential and guided by the firm will and\r\nconfidence of the Azerbaijani people, we are carrying out\r\nthe strategy of strengthening our independence and\r\nimplementing democratic market reforms. Today, from this\r\nlofty rostrum, I firmly declare that no one will be able to\r\nmake the Azerbaijani people stray from this path. We look\r\nto the future of our country with optimism.\r\nOur optimism is also linked with historic processes\r\ntaking place in the world as well as with profound changes\r\nin the system of international relations. A world order\r\nbased on equal rights and replacing military and ideological\r\nconfrontation will certainly form the future basis of this\r\nsystem. Partnership and enduring peace and security for\r\neveryone, in accordance with international law and the\r\nprinciples and provisions of the United Nations Charter, are\r\nbecoming the fundamental principles of the new world\r\norder. We see the light at the end of the tunnel, a tunnel\r\nleading from a world of hostility based on the use of force\r\nto an era of cooperation and prosperity. We are ready to\r\nwalk along this road together, hand in hand with all the\r\nother countries and peoples of the world.\r\nHowever, the threats looming over mankind have not\r\nbeen totally eliminated. Old stereotypes still exist, and\r\nnumerous problems, accumulated over decades of\r\nconfrontation, especially problems in the sphere of\r\ndisarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, have not yet been overcome. Relations\r\nbetween States with different economic potentials still\r\nsuffer from the maladies of the past. Time is presenting us\r\nwith new challenges, challenges linked with environmental\r\ndifficulties and population and development problems.\r\nAggressive nationalism and separatism, giving birth to\r\nconflicts in the Caucasus, the Balkans and other hot spots,\r\nhave become realities following the collapse of the old\r\nworld order. These conflicts not only hamper the\r\ndevelopment of independent States and directly threaten the\r\nvery existence of fledgling democracies, but also threaten\r\ninternational security as a whole.\r\nThat is why, in a post-confrontational world, a\r\nspecial responsibility rests on the shoulders of\r\nauthoritative international organizations as well as on\r\nthose shoulders of the big Powers. Using their political\r\nweight and their economic, financial and military\r\nresources, they must more actively direct their potential\r\ntowards extinguishing the flame of conflicts and towards\r\nthe consolidation of peace, stability and security\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nIt goes without saying that in the construction of a\r\nnew world order there is a leading role for the United\r\nNations, which will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary next\r\nyear, and for its Security Council, which has extensive\r\nexperience in resolving a number of conflicts and crises.\r\nHowever, the Security Council will still face the difficult\r\ntest of proving to the international community its\r\nefficiency under new conditions. Today, as never before,\r\nthe Security Council is required to be more persistent in\r\nachieving guaranteed implementation of its resolutions.\r\nWe hope that enlargement of the Council will contribute\r\nto its strengthening.\r\nWe attach great importance to the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which is primarily seen as ensuring\r\nthe closest possible interaction between States in the\r\ndecision-making process, on the basis of compromises\r\nand the balance of interests.\r\nUnder present conditions, one should mention the\r\nincreased importance of the efficient use by the\r\nSecretary-General of his powers, as well as the support\r\nthat must be given him by Member States, which share\r\nwith him the responsibility for strengthening international\r\npeace and security.\r\nGenerally speaking, the Azerbaijani Republic is\r\noptimistic about the future of the United Nations. We are\r\ndetermined to continue to protect the lofty principles of\r\nthe United Nations and to seek improvement in the\r\nauthority and efficiency of the Organization.\r\nFor many of those present the notion of war and\r\narmed conflict may, fortunately, be associated with\r\nhistory or faraway events. But for my people it is a cruel\r\nreality and a bloody daily routine.\r\nFor six years the flame of war has been blazing on\r\nthe land of Azerbaijan. The Republic of Armenia, under\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nthe pretext of realizing the right to self-determination of an\r\nethnic group of Armenians living in the Nagorny Karabakh\r\nregion of Azerbaijan, is openly carrying out plans to annex\r\nthe territories of our State, to forcibly change its State\r\nborders and to expel the Azerbaijani people from their\r\nhomes.\r\nAll this is cloaked by an arbitrary interpretation of the\r\nright of peoples to self-determination as meaning a right of\r\nany ethnic community to proclaim itself independent and to\r\njoin another State. Such an interpretation of the right to\r\nself-determination blatantly contradicts the principles of\r\nState sovereignty and territorial integrity. Any attempt to\r\nmake this right absolute results in cruel conflicts, which we\r\nhave witnessed in our region and in other parts of our\r\nplanet.\r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has\r\nexpressed his concern on this issue, saying:\r\n\"... if every ethnic, religious or linguistic group\r\nclaimed statehood, there would be no limit to\r\nfragmentation, and peace, security and economic\r\nwell-being for all would become ever more difficult to\r\nachieve.\" (A/47/277, para. 17)\r\nI fully agree with Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali that:\r\n\"The sovereignty, territorial integrity and\r\nindependence of States within the established\r\ninternational system, and the principle of self-\r\ndetermination for peoples, both of great value\r\nand importance, must not be permitted to work\r\nagainst each other in the period ahead.\"\r\n(ibid, para. 19)\r\nBeing aware that the international community is\r\ninsufficiently, and sometimes unilaterally, informed about\r\nevents in our region, I should like to brief the Assembly on\r\nthe real situation.\r\nHaving created a powerful military build-up on the\r\nterritory of the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, the\r\nRepublic of Armenia started intensive military activities\r\nagainst our Republic. With the occupation of the town of\r\nShusha and of the Lachin region, the annexation of\r\nNagorny Karabakh was completed, and about 50,000\r\nresident Azerbaijanis were ousted. Using the Nagorny\r\nKarabakh springboard, Armenian armed forces then\r\noccupied another six regions of Azerbaijan: Kalbajar,\r\nAgdam, Fizuli, Djebrail, Zangelan and Kubatli, which, like\r\nthe Lachin region, are situated outside the former Nagorny\r\nKarabakh autonomous region, with a territory four times\r\nbigger than that of Nagorny Karabakh.\r\nAs a result of the aggression, more than 20 per cent\r\nof the territory of Azerbaijan is under occupation by the\r\narmed forces of the Republic of Armenia. I must\r\nmention here the huge losses on the Azerbaijani side:\r\nmore than 20,000 killed, about 100,000 wounded and\r\n6,000 taken prisoner. In addition, more than 1 million\r\nAzerbaijanis - about 15 per cent of the population - have\r\nbecome refugees and live in tents. In their own country\r\nthey have been deprived of shelter, and they suffer from\r\nheat, cold and epidemics, and experience shortages of\r\ntheir basic needs. Seven hundred towns and villages have\r\nbeen levelled on the occupied Azerbaijani territories;\r\npractically all the houses, schools, hospitals, and ancient\r\nmonuments have been burned down and looted.\r\nI think there is no need to prove that here we are\r\ndealing not with the realization of the right to\r\nself-determination, but with a gross violation of\r\ninternational law, in the form of aggression against the\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence\r\nof a United Nations Member State.\r\nThe war has created unbearable conditions for my\r\npeople. It aggravates social tension and hampers the\r\nimplementation of economic and political reforms aimed\r\nat the democratization of Azerbaijani society.\r\nAs a result of the war, the Azerbaijani people have\r\nsuffered a huge material loss, amounting to billions of\r\ndollars. As for the moral damage inflicted on human life\r\nand destiny, there is hardly anything to compare to the\r\nsorrow and pain of my people.\r\nBlood is being shed now, not only in Azerbaijan, but\r\nalso in other hot spots of the world. Peoples must not\r\nremain indifferent to these tragic events. Collective\r\nefforts should be made in order to prevent the escalation\r\nof armed conflicts and to achieve their just and lasting\r\nresolution.\r\nDuring the past two years the Security Council\r\nadopted four resolutions and its President has made six\r\nstatements in connection with the occupation of\r\nAzerbaijani territories by armed forces of the Republic of\r\nArmenia.\r\nIn all its resolutions the Security Council reaffirms\r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani\r\nRepublic; emphasizes the inadmissibility of the use of\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nforce for the acquisition of territory; it strongly demands\r\nthe immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of\r\nall occupying forces from all the occupied regions of\r\nAzerbaijan; and calls for the return of refugees to their\r\nhomes.\r\nBut all these decisions have so far been completely\r\nignored by the Republic of Armenia. Moreover, Armenia\r\ncontinues to build up its military presence in the occupied\r\nterritories of Azerbaijan.\r\nOn the other hand, the Security Council has also failed\r\nto put into effect the mechanism for implementing the\r\nresolutions. Here we face a question: to what extent is the\r\nSecurity Council consistent and resolute, and how is the\r\ndegree of application of its powers in each case defined?\r\nNon-compliance with the decisions of the Security\r\nCouncil does not serve the interests of the United Nations,\r\nand may undermine confidence in its abilities to achieve its\r\nmain objective: the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nExperience gained in the process of settling regional\r\nconflicts shows that the efforts to implement resolutions\r\nsucceed only when endorsed by the political-military means\r\nenvisaged in the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe duty of the most authoritative international\r\norganization in the world community is to take effective\r\nmeasures with respect to the aggressor State, which is\r\nblatantly violating norms of international law.\r\nIn the efforts to settle the Armenian-Azerbaijani\r\nconflict, we rely on such an authoritative organization as\r\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(CSCE). The Minsk Group, created by the CSCE for the\r\nsettlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, also\r\nproceeds on the basis of the necessity for the evacuation of\r\nall the occupied territories and the complete withdrawal of\r\nthe occupying forces beyond the boundaries of Azerbaijan.\r\nIt also calls for respect for the sovereignty, territorial\r\nintegrity and internationally recognized borders of\r\nAzerbaijan.\r\nHowever, unfortunately, the numerous mediation\r\nefforts of the CSCE have not yet brought about any\r\ntangible, concrete results, due to the lack of appropriate\r\nmechanisms.\r\nOnly now do we have the first positive result. At the\r\ncost of enormous efforts, and owing to active mediation by\r\nthe Russian Federation and the CSCE Minsk Group, a\r\ncease-fire has been achieved in the conflict zone. The\r\nfighting and bloodshed have been stopped for more than\r\nfour months. We greatly appreciate all this. But the\r\nsituation still remains very complicated and the truce is\r\nvery fragile.\r\nThe Republic of Armenia has put forward an\r\nillegitimate condition, that of exchanging part of the\r\noccupied Azerbaijani territories for independent status for\r\nthe Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic.\r\nIt demands that it keep its military presence in this\r\nAzerbaijani region and that it control the town of Shusha\r\nand the Lachin region of Azerbaijan, which implies\r\nconsolidation of its annexation of our territories.\r\nArmenia completely excludes the restoration of the\r\ndemographic composition of Nagorny Karabakh as it was\r\nat the beginning of the conflict and the return of the\r\nAzerbaijani population, including its return to one of the\r\nancient centres of Azerbaijani culture, the town of\r\nShusha. On these conditions, Armenia, ignoring the\r\nSecurity Council’s resolutions, proposes the deployment\r\nof an international separation force along the perimeter of\r\nthe occupied Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan,\r\nthus trying to turn it into a tool for freezing the situation\r\nand to make it a hostage of its annexationist policy.\r\nThe position of the Azerbaijani Republic has always\r\nbeen constructive and peace-loving. Despite all the\r\ndamage inflicted upon us, we propose peace to the\r\nArmenian side on the basis of international law, justice\r\nand humanism. We are prepared to provide guarantees to\r\nthe Armenian population of Nagorny Karabakh. We\r\nfavour the restoration, on a mutual basis, of\r\ncommunications in the region, including the humanitarian\r\ncorridor between Nagorny Karabakh and the Republic of\r\nArmenia. We are also prepared to discuss the status of\r\nNagorny Karabakh within the Azerbaijani State.\r\nHowever, there are norms and principles that we\r\nconsider eternal: the sovereignty and territorial integrity\r\nof our country, the evacuation of all the occupied\r\nterritories and the return of refugees to their homes,\r\nincluding the return of 50,000 Azerbaijani refugees to\r\ntheir native land in Nagorny Karabakh.\r\nThe Azerbaijani Republic, while it still wants a\r\npeaceful political settlement, considers that only the\r\nelimination of the consequences of aggression, through\r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolutions, will\r\nmake it possible to carry on a stable and productive\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nnegotiating process, with the goal of establishing a durable,\r\nstable cease-fire and ensuring security for all the people of\r\nthe region. Here we count on the assistance of the world\r\ncommunity to ensure the realization of coordinated peaceful\r\ndecisions on the basis of a precise mandate for peace-\r\nkeepers in accordance with international norms.\r\nWe highly appreciate the cease-fire agreement. We\r\nrealize that it does not mean peace yet, but it creates the\r\nnecessary conditions for its rapid achievement. On several\r\noccasions we have voiced our firm resolution to observe the\r\ncease-fire regime until the peace agreement is reached and\r\nthere is a total cessation of the military conflict. I repeat\r\nthat today from this lofty rostrum of the United Nations.\r\nWe support the peace-keeping activities of the CSCE\r\nMinsk Group and the Russian Federation, and favour the\r\nconsolidation of their efforts against any kind of\r\ncompetition in the process of settling the conflict. Such\r\ncompetition could only complicate the achievement of\r\npeace, which is needed equally by the peoples of\r\nAzerbaijan and of Armenia.\r\nOur demands for the complete evacuation of all\r\noccupied Azerbaijani territories are legitimate; they are in\r\nfull conformity with Security Council resolutions. Attempts\r\nto annex any regions are unacceptable to us and go against\r\nthe norms of international law.\r\nAs a result of a war thrust upon us, an extremely\r\ndifficult humanitarian situation has emerged in the\r\nRepublic. Every seventh person in a country with a\r\npopulation of 7 million is a refugee, lacking a home, work\r\nand means for existence. Suffering from harsh miseries,\r\nrefugees and displaced persons are staying in tent camps.\r\nThe severe winter conditions and the lack of necessary food\r\nand medicines have created a threat of epidemics and\r\nfamine among the most vulnerable group of the population.\r\nOvercoming the extremely grave refugee situation has\r\nbecome one of the major concerns of the Azerbaijani State.\r\nInternational organizations and a number of States\r\nhave responded to the urgent appeal of our Republic, and\r\nwe express our most sincere gratitude to the Governments\r\nof Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan,\r\nSwitzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark, which have\r\nbecome the largest donors to the United Nations\r\nprogrammes of humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan. We\r\nare also grateful to the Governments of Turkey, Iran, Saudi\r\nArabia and other countries for their considerable\r\nhumanitarian assistance within the framework of bilateral\r\nrelations, and to the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross, the United Nations Children’s Fund,\r\nDoctors Without Borders and numerous non-governmental\r\norganizations which have rendered invaluable assistance\r\nto the refugees and displaced persons in Azerbaijan.\r\nThe role and place of my country in international\r\nrelations are influenced by its geographical location and\r\nsocio-political orientation, as well as the historical-cultural\r\ntraditions of a land where Western and Eastern\r\ncivilizations have merged. It is with an awareness of\r\nthese peculiarities and the challenges of change that we\r\nare building, step by step, our cooperation with the\r\noutside world. Since the international recognition of the\r\nAzerbaijani Republic, we have established equal, balanced\r\nrelations with the overwhelming majority of States, and\r\nwe have joined a number of world and regional\r\norganizations. We have made serious efforts to expand\r\nour international relations and to restore the links that\r\nwere lost due to certain conditions. Attaching special\r\nimportance to historical, geographical, economic and\r\nhumanitarian links with the independent States that have\r\nemerged on the territory of the former Soviet Union, we\r\nfavour the development of equal cooperation with them,\r\nin particular with Russia, both on the basis of bilateral\r\nrelations and within the framework of the Commonwealth\r\nof Independent States.\r\nAzerbaijan is developing friendly relations with the\r\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, France and China.\r\nClose good-neighbourly ties link us with the countries of\r\nour region and of adjacent regions, countries such as\r\nTurkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Pakistan, with\r\nwhich we closely cooperate within the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference.\r\nAzerbaijan’s accession in May this year to the\r\nPartnership for Peace programme of the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization was an important event in the\r\npolitical life of our country. This programme attracts us\r\nwith the idea of cooperation and interaction in the\r\ninterests of common security. I welcome the accession of\r\nthe former members of the Warsaw Pact to this\r\nprogramme. This fact gives hope to the whole of the\r\nEurasian continent for peaceful cooperation, thereby\r\nensuring security, progress and prosperity for all peoples,\r\nand thereby eventually eliminating the possibility of the\r\nemergence of new adversarial blocs. We hope that\r\nparticipation in the NATO programme will enhance the\r\nrole of our country in the building of a new European\r\nsecurity structure.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nThis year the Azerbaijan Republic was accorded the\r\nstatus of Observer in the Non-Aligned Movement, a step\r\nthat provides us with a broad opportunity for the\r\nestablishment of bilateral contacts in various fields and for\r\nthe rapprochement of our positions with those of the States\r\nmembers of the Movement.\r\nThe accession of the young Azerbaijani State to the\r\nUnited Nations as a full Member in January 1992 marked\r\nthe most important stage in the development of our country.\r\nThe scope of our cooperation with many United Nations\r\ninternational agencies has been expanding ever since.\r\nWe appreciate especially the cooperation we enjoy\r\nwith the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World\r\nBank. Concrete projects that are of great importance for\r\nthe socio-economic development of our country have been\r\nelaborated as a result of the practical work of experts\r\nrepresenting these large financial institutions. We assume\r\nthat many possibilities exist for our fruitful cooperation\r\nwith international financial institutions. We understand the\r\nprudence and concern demonstrated by the heads of the\r\nIMF and the World Bank with regard to the war conditions\r\nin which the Azerbaijani Republic has been engaged. At\r\nthe same time, however, the IMF has given a structural\r\nadjustment loan to Armenia, which is in a state of war with\r\nus. We consider that justice requires at least a balanced\r\napproach in this matter.\r\nWe are expecting a great deal from the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) in the way of technical\r\nassistance in the drawing up of national programmes for the\r\ndevelopment of market economy infrastructures, and\r\nassistance to enable our country make progress towards\r\nmodern management methods and the application of\r\nadvanced technologies.\r\nWe attach especial attention to international economic\r\ncooperation, and it is with deep satisfaction that I should\r\nlike to inform you that on 20 September 1994, as a result\r\nof long and difficult negotiations, the Azerbaijani Republic\r\nsigned a contract with a consortium of large international\r\noil companies for the joint development of the off-shore\r\noilfields for a 30-year term in the Azerbaijani sector of the\r\nCaspian Sea.\r\nThis landmark economic endeavour testifies to our\r\npolicy of openness to the whole world, as well as to our\r\npolicy of liberalizing the economy and attracting foreign\r\ninvestment. The signing of this unique contract will\r\npromote the strengthening of cooperation and\r\nrapprochement among the peoples and countries\r\nparticipating in its implementation, that is, Azerbaijan, the\r\nUnited States, Russia, the United Kingdom, Turkey,\r\nNorway and Saudi Arabia.\r\nIn mentioning this, I should like once again to\r\nunderline the fact that the Azerbaijani Republic is seeking\r\nfull-fledged integration into the world community and has\r\nthe full capacity to do so. For that reason the core of its\r\npolicy is the aspiration for peace, and we pin great hopes\r\non the United Nations in assisting us to achieve this\r\npeace.\r\nThe Azerbaijani people have placed great confidence\r\nin me in electing me President of a young, independent\r\nState, and today it has been my privilege to convey to\r\nyou its deepest aspirations. I leave this lofty rostrum of\r\nthe General Assembly in the hope that the voice of my\r\npeople will be heard by the members of the Assembly\r\nand that it will pave the way to their hearts.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Azerbaijan Republic for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Heydar Alirza ogly Aliyev, President of the\r\nAzerbaijan Republic, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral Debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nnext speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Antonio Martino.\r\nMr. Martino (Italy): Mr. President, I am delighted\r\nto begin by congratulating you and your country, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at this session. I also wish to thank your\r\ndistinguished predecessor, Ambassador Insanally.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to congratulate the\r\nSovereign Military Order of Malta on its admission to\r\nObserver status in the General Assembly.\r\nMy statement fully endorses and follows on that of\r\nthe German Foreign Minister, who spoke in his capacity\r\nas Chairman of the European Council.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nFrom the very beginning of its membership in the\r\nUnited Nations Italy’s foreign policy has been guided by its\r\nactive support for the Organization’s principles and\r\nfunctions. Our contributions to United Nations\r\ndeliberations, peace-keeping operations and aid through\r\nmultilateral channels are tangible proof of Italy’s faith in\r\nthe project drawn up at San Francisco almost 50 years ago.\r\nOur newly elected Government will remain steadfast\r\nin this approach to supporting the United Nations and\r\nbuilding upon the historic opportunities offered by the new\r\ninternational situation. Let me emphasize that, now more\r\nthan ever, Italy is firmly committed to fostering personal,\r\npolitical, and economic freedom, protecting individual rights\r\nand liberties and enforcing the rule of law. These are the\r\npreconditions for peace and prosperity and the reasons why\r\nItaly is presenting its candidature to the Security Council\r\nfor the period 1995-1996.\r\nUnfortunately, the hopes that were kindled by the end\r\nof the cold war, with its promises of peace and stability,\r\nhave not been met in international reality. At the same\r\ntime, there is little doubt that today we are facing fewer\r\nglobal risks, despite local conflicts, intolerance and racial\r\nand ethnic strife. It is thus our task to embark on a new\r\nage of cooperation, democracy and development, in which\r\nthe United Nations must play a central role. Today, the\r\nGeneral Assembly can become the link between\r\nexpectations and commitment.\r\nItaly will continue to play its part in peace-keeping, as\r\nit is already doing in eight different missions, including\r\nlogistical support for the operation in former Yugoslavia\r\nand training centres and permanent bases for peace-keeping\r\nforces on its territory. The new United Nations base in\r\nBrindisi is particularly significant in this regard.\r\nHowever, we cannot ignore the high costs of the\r\nproliferation of primarily internal conflicts. The budget for\r\npeace-keeping operations currently amounts to\r\napproximately $3 billion, three times the regular budget of\r\nthe Organization. The Presidency of the European Union\r\nhas noted this particular aspect of peace-keeping operations.\r\nWe must strengthen preventive diplomacy in order to avoid\r\nover-extending our capabilities, becoming ineffective and\r\nrisking financial collapse.\r\nIn the wake of the crisis in Rwanda, my Government\r\nis promoting the establishment of a task force for rapid\r\nintervention in humanitarian emergencies. This matter is\r\nnow being considered in the appropriate forums and the\r\nresults will be presented to the United Nations. I welcome\r\nthe support expressed for an emergency humanitarian\r\ninstrument by the Presidents of the United States, the\r\nRussian Federation and Argentina, and believe that our\r\nideas and proposals follow the same orientation.\r\nEntrusting peace-keeping functions to regional\r\norganizations is another option for crisis management.\r\nMy Government has moved consistently in this direction\r\nat the national level and in its capacity as\r\nChairman-in-Office of the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE).\r\nItaly attaches particular importance to an effective\r\nand efficient functioning of the Security Council. The\r\nmatter of equitable representation on the Security Council\r\nand of increasing its membership requires thorough\r\nexamination. To this end, Italy has submitted one of the\r\nmost realistic and comprehensive proposals to the Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group. We hope that the General Assembly\r\nwill reach a consensus on the methods and timetable for\r\na truly equitable reform.\r\nMany members question whether the pre-eminence\r\nthe Organization has given to peace-keeping in recent\r\nyears has not drained the other fundamental objectives of\r\nthe United Nations - namely, economic and social\r\ndevelopment - of initiative and resources. The\r\nSecretary-General has wisely acknowledged these\r\nconcerns in his recent agenda for development.\r\nMr. Seniloli (Fiji), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nAs that document states, peace is only one of the\r\ndimensions of development. The others are the economy,\r\nthe environment, justice and democracy. To the extent\r\nthat democracy protects and promotes personal liberty and\r\neconomic freedom, it has a decisive impact on\r\ndevelopment by encouraging the strongest force behind\r\neconomic growth and personal development - individual\r\ncreativity. A prosperous democracy will be free of the\r\ninternal tensions that have caused so many of today’s\r\nconflicts. The United Nations will foster a more peaceful\r\nworld by promoting freedom and justice in addition to\r\ncontinuing its peace-keeping functions.\r\nIn today’s world, the issue of trade is of paramount\r\nimportance. As I like to say, trade unites us; politics\r\ndivides us. At the Naples Summit, Italy, in its present\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the G-7, strongly advocated the\r\nfurther dismantling of barriers to world trade in order to\r\nfoster the creation of wealth. We are convinced that the\r\nleaders of the free world must avoid squandering the\r\nunique opportunity for world peace and prosperity offered\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nby current historic developments. They must resist the\r\npressure of interest groups and be ready to serve the\r\ngeneral interests of their nations and the nations of the\r\nworld, which today more than ever require the opening of\r\nmarkets and the liberalization of trade. This will be the\r\nrole of the World Trade Organization.\r\nIn this spirit, we endorse the principles of the agenda\r\nfor development and are ready to help establish the\r\nguidelines for their implementation. The fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations Charter will provide an\r\nopportunity for fostering such a process.\r\nI should now like to address the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly in my capacity as Chairman-in-Office of\r\nthe CSCE. We are actively promoting peaceful solutions\r\nto several regional crises. In the former Yugoslavia we are\r\nengaged in restoring long-term missions, appointing\r\nOmbudsmen for the Bosnian Federation, instituting a CSCE\r\nmission in Sarajevo and admitting The Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia to the CSCE.\r\nWe have lent our good offices to Ukraine, where a\r\nCSCE mission will be instituted, and to Georgia for the\r\ncrises in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The CSCE\r\nPresidency has also worked towards facilitating the\r\nwithdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic States and\r\nfinding a solution to the problems of citizenship and status\r\nof non-citizens in that area. Through the local CSCE\r\nmissions, the CSCE Presidency is also attempting to foster\r\na political solution to the Moldova-Trans-Dniester and\r\nTajikistan crises, while it actively supports the efforts of the\r\nChairman of the Conference on Nagorny Karabakh,\r\nAmbassador Eliasson.\r\nAt the 1992 Helsinki Summit the CSCE declared itself\r\nto be a regional arrangement under Chapter VIII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and adopted specific guidelines on\r\npeace-keeping. The ministerial meetings in Stockholm and\r\nRome led to the United Nations-CSCE Framework\r\nAgreement in March 1993 and to the CSCE’s being granted\r\nobserver status at the United Nations. My recent letter to\r\nthe Secretary-General on developing and strengthening\r\ncooperation between the CSCE and the United Nations was\r\na follow-up to these decisions, as was the establishment of\r\nrelations between the CSCE and numerous United Nations\r\nagencies working in areas of common concern. One\r\nspecific proposal is to attribute primary responsibility to the\r\nCSCE for issues concerning stability and security in its\r\narea, without impinging on the statutory powers of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nPeace-keeping is an area that requires closer\r\ncooperation. The two Organizations should adopt a\r\nstandard set of principles for the peace-keeping activities\r\nundertaken by individual States or third parties.\r\nI should like to address the European Presidency’s\r\nstatement and memorandum on our current international\r\npolicies, limiting myself to those issues which more\r\nclosely concern Italy for historical and geographical\r\nreasons.\r\nItaly warmly welcomes the acceptance by the\r\nCroatian-Muslim federation and the Serbian-Montenegran\r\nfederation of the peace plan submitted to them on 6 July.\r\nThat plan provides a realistic solution to territorial\r\ndisputes and constitutional issues and ensures that Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina will retain its international identity.\r\nUnfortunately, the repeated rejection of the plan by the\r\nBosnian Serb leadership is a source of deep\r\ndisappointment. This has made tougher sanctions against\r\nPale inevitable in order to force it to reconsider its\r\nposition.\r\nThe partial lifting of sanctions against Belgrade,\r\nwhich we have advocated from the beginning, will\r\nencourage the Serbian Government to pursue its new,\r\nmore constructive policy. This includes the agreement to\r\nallow international monitors to ensure the effective\r\nsealing of the border between Serbia and Bosnia. In our\r\nongoing commitment to find a solution to the intractable\r\ncrisis in Bosnia, we have been trying to involve other\r\nimportant international forums, starting with the G-7,\r\nenlarged to include Russia, in joint efforts to foster a\r\npolitical solution.\r\nWith regard to the Middle East, Italy welcomed the\r\nsigning of the Cairo Accords, concluded on 4 May, which\r\nauthorized the start of self-government in Gaza and\r\nJericho. We also salute the subsequent transfer to the\r\nPalestinian authorities of jurisdiction over the issues\r\ncovered in the Washington Agreements. Italy is pleased\r\nto have contributed to the resumption of negotiations that\r\nled to the Cairo Accords, through our participation in the\r\ninternational temporary presence in Hebron to implement\r\nSecurity Council resolution 904 (1994). Italy reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to contributing politically and economically\r\nto the reconstruction of the Palestinian territories. The\r\nIsraeli-Jordan Accords of 25 July represent a milestone in\r\nthe construction of a new Middle East on the basis of\r\npeace and cooperation. We hope that all these\r\ndevelopments will stimulate progress in other negotiations\r\nbetween Israel and its neighbours.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nIn the Mediterranean basin, serious instabilities and\r\ntensions are spreading. Italy intends to make its efforts to\r\nensure that this region sets an example of tolerance,\r\neconomic cooperation and democracy.\r\nAs one of the main architects of the peace process in\r\nMozambique, Italy is pleased with the progress achieved in\r\nrecent months. Elections are now set for 27 and 28\r\nOctober this year. We will continue to collaborate with the\r\nUnited Nations and other donor countries in the\r\nreconstruction of Mozambique. We also hope that regional\r\ncooperation in southern Africa will help improve economic\r\nconditions in Mozambique, thereby strengthening the\r\nprocess of peace and democratization. We hope that\r\nMozambique will become another United Nations success\r\nstory, like the peace-keeping operations in Namibia,\r\nCambodia, El Salvador, Guatemala and elsewhere.\r\nWe would also like to encourage the trends towards\r\nre-establishing peace in Angola on the basis of the Peace\r\nAccords and the pertinent Security Council resolutions.\r\nAn area that has seen great progress in recent years is\r\nthe further strengthening of disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation. The implementation of existing agreements\r\nis a difficult task for our diplomacies, but the drive towards\r\nmore advanced forms of disarmament and arms control is\r\nrelentless. We look forward confidently to negotiations to\r\nban nuclear testing and to halt the production of fissionable\r\nmaterial. Progress in this field should also contribute to the\r\nindefinite and unconditional extension of the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty.\r\nWith regard to conventional weapons, I wish to take\r\nthis opportunity formally to announce the terms of Italy’s\r\nmoratorium on the export of anti-personnel mines. The\r\nmoratorium will apply to all transfers and be applied until\r\nnew international regulations become effective. This\r\ncommitment imposes an economic cost, but one that my\r\ncountry is willing to pay. We urge all Member States to\r\nadopt similar national moratoriums until the international\r\nregime has been finalized.\r\nBut let us not forget that conflicts, especially internal\r\nones, are also created through the violation of fundamental\r\nhuman rights. That is why we are in favour of\r\nstrengthening the mechanisms to monitor and protect those\r\nrights by fully implementing the High Commissioner’s\r\nmandate and strengthening the Centre for Human Rights.\r\nWhen these rights are seriously violated, despite all\r\nefforts, we are in favour of recourse to a fair judicial\r\nprocess. In the same spirit with which we welcomed and\r\ncontributed to the International Tribunal on crimes\r\ncommitted in the former Yugoslavia, we support the\r\ncreation of an international criminal court for the\r\nadjudication of all violations of human rights, wherever\r\nthey may occur. This court must be allowed to inflict the\r\nappropriate punishment, with the exception of the death\r\npenalty, which Italy has consistently opposed. We are\r\nparticularly pleased that, after years of hard work, the\r\nInternational Law Commission has completed a draft\r\nstatute for the court, and look forward to contributing to\r\nthe Assembly’s debate on the matter.\r\nThe strengthening of international security is closely\r\nrelated to the fight against terrorism and organized crime.\r\nFrom 21 to 23 November this year, Italy will be hosting\r\nin Naples the ministerial World Conference on Organized\r\nTransnational Crime, under the auspices of the Crime\r\nPrevention and Criminal Justice Branch of the United\r\nNations.\r\nItaly is also actively participating in the preparation\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development, to be held\r\nin Copenhagen in March 1995, by contributing its\r\nexperience in the three crucial issues on the agenda:\r\ncombating poverty, unemployment and discrimination.\r\nWe live in an exciting but complex world. Few of\r\nus would disagree with the comment of Alfonso the Wise,\r\nKing of Castile, a medieval patron of astronomy, who is\r\nquoted as saying, in effect, \"If the Lord Almighty had\r\nconsulted me before embarking on the Creation, I would\r\nhave recommended something simpler.\"\r\nWhile rereading the first address Italy delivered to\r\nthis Assembly at the eleventh session, I was deeply\r\nmoved, and not only because it was given by my father.\r\nRereading it, it made poignantly clear the far-reaching\r\nchanges since 1956, both on the international scene -\r\nfrom decolonization to the end of the cold war - and on\r\nthe Italian domestic political scene. In that address, he\r\ndefined the United Nations as\r\n\"the most complete expression of that education of\r\nthe human race, acquired, as Lessing said, through\r\nsuffering and error\". (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Eleventh Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 588th meeting, para. 94)\r\nAnd today, so many years later, it is an honour for\r\nme to reaffirm the same profound conviction and to\r\npledge to this Assembly the total dedication of Italy and\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nits Government to the ideals embodied in the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nAddress by Mr. Efraín Goldenberg Schreiber, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Peru\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Peru.\r\nMr. Efraín Goldenberg Schreiber, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Peru,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Peru, His Excellency Mr. Efraín Goldenberg\r\nSchreiber, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Goldenberg Schreiber (Peru) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I should like sincerely to congratulate Mr.\r\nEssy on his election as president over the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. His country and mine\r\nmaintain friendly diplomatic relations and close links\r\nstrengthened by the historic ties between Africa and Latin\r\nAmerica. I wish him success in his endeavours and offer\r\nhim the fullest cooperation of the Peruvian delegation.\r\nWe live in an age that confronts the international\r\ncommunity as a whole, and the United Nations in\r\nparticular, with big challenges. Representative democracy\r\nand the market economy have spread throughout the world,\r\nalong with an intensification of integration processes and\r\nthe globalization of trade.\r\nNevertheless, international peace and security have not\r\nyet been consolidated in all regions. We have witnessed\r\nevents such as the unexpected collapse of States that had\r\nseemed to be solid, episodes of massive violence within\r\nsome countries and the tragic and complex situations that\r\nresulted, persistent aggression against a Member of this\r\nOrganization and the exacerbation of nationalism in many\r\nparts of the world. All these things challenge the present\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to respond.\r\nFaced with such challenges, the United Nations must\r\nreaffirm its central role as the indispensable leader in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and in the\r\npromotion of world-wide development. This is its duty, not\r\nonly because of the universal character of the United\r\nNations system, but also because of the contractual\r\nsignificance of the instrument by which it was established.\r\nIn this respect, we must bear in mind that the\r\npotential of the United Nations as the foremost\r\ninternational Organization can be reinforced by increased\r\nand more efficient coordination with the regional\r\norganizations.\r\nBy the same token, we attach special importance to\r\nthe General Assembly’s exercise of the powers assigned\r\nto it by the Charter, as well as to the expansion and\r\nreform of the Security Council. With regard to the latter,\r\nwe should seek to correct the imbalances in its present\r\ncomposition, improve its decision-making machinery and\r\nmake its working methods more transparent, while\r\nstriving to make its composition truly representative of all\r\nMember States of the Organization.\r\nAs the Secretary-General pointed out in his reports,\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277) and \"An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment\" (A/48/935), it now appears to be politically\r\nfeasible to respond to the multiple requirements of\r\ninternational peace and security while encouraging\r\ncooperation in the social and economic field, because the\r\ncomplementarity of these elements is such that without\r\neconomic development there can be no peace or security.\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" must therefore be complemented\r\nby an agenda for development. In this way the United\r\nNations could lead the international community, in\r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of its\r\nCharter, and integrate the actions of our Organization with\r\nthe work of the Bretton Woods institutions, and above all\r\nthe World Trade Organization.\r\nIn this regard, we share the concern of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who has warned that the subject of development\r\nis in danger of vanishing from the United Nations agenda.\r\nWe must therefore emphasize that the grave problems\r\nrelated to development must be included in our\r\nOrganization’s work and that developed and developing\r\ncountries must agree on the need to address, urgently and\r\nadequately, critical situations such as dire poverty.\r\nThe coming World Summit for Social Development\r\noffers us an opportunity that we must seize. Peru, which\r\ntook part in the early stages of the process that led to the\r\ndecision to convene that Summit, will contribute to it the\r\nnational programme for social development that the\r\nGovernment of President Fujimori has been carrying out,\r\na programme that gives priority attention to the basic\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nservices of health, education and the administration of\r\njustice, particularly for the poorest.\r\nIn the same context, Peru believes that the internal\r\nefforts of developing countries in the vital spheres of social\r\nand economic advance must be matched by high-priority\r\nmultilateral and bilateral cooperation.\r\nI must also observe that in most of our countries\r\nsocial development also means stability. Therefore,\r\ncontinuing democratization and modernization is largely\r\ndependent on the assignment of high priority to this\r\ninescapable challenge.\r\nAlong with the problems of development, the rapidly\r\nevolving situation today presents us, as an international\r\nOrganization, with a number of particularly complex\r\nsubjects. Outstanding among them is the process of\r\nreconciliation and peace in the Middle East, which will\r\nhave important effects on regional and world stability and\r\nsecurity, as well as on trade, regional cooperation and\r\ndisarmament. Peru supports this process, and believes that\r\nresolutions adopted in the General Assembly must properly\r\nreflect that reality and contribute to the maintenance of an\r\nappropriate political climate to advance the negotiating\r\nprocess.\r\nWe also welcome the new South Africa, which\r\nembodies the fulfilment of the essential principles of the\r\nCharter and which is a possible factor for regional stability.\r\nIt also provides an example of democratic change.\r\nThe tragic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which\r\nhas made clear the serious limitations of multilateral\r\norganizations, demands increased efforts by the\r\ninternational community to ensure an early and lasting\r\npeace.\r\nI now wish to address a subject that we cannot ignore,\r\none that affects the international community as a whole and\r\nthat is particularly delicate for my own country: the drug\r\nproblem. Peru reiterates its resolve to continue to fight\r\nillegal drug trafficking, as well as its conviction that this\r\nserious problem urgently requires the unwavering political\r\ncommitment of the international community. That alone\r\nwill make it possible to adopt concrete and realistic\r\nmeasures to stand up to this scourge in accordance with the\r\nmandates of the Global Programme of Action adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly in 1990.\r\nInternational coordination and cooperation against\r\ndrug-trafficking are indispensable. In that regard, I am\r\npleased to point out that the recent Summit of Presidents\r\nof the member countries of the Rio Group accepted the\r\nproposal of the President of the Republic of Peru, Alberto\r\nFujimori, to coordinate legislation to penalize money-\r\nlaundering, allow the confiscation of property linked to\r\ndrug-trafficking, establish swift extradition procedures,\r\npromote judicial and police cooperation on this matter and\r\nbolster cooperation for alternative development.\r\nMy country also pays special attention to human\r\nrights. Their promotion and defence constitute an\r\ninescapable obligation of the international community,\r\nwhich must therefore reinforce and improve current\r\nmechanisms of the system for the protection of human\r\nrights, in order to increase their efficacy.\r\nWe are pleased to note the growing recognition and\r\nsupport by this international Organization for those\r\ncountries that, like us, are continuing to struggle to defend\r\nlife and civilized ways of coexistence against the\r\nunjustifiable and irrational violence of terrorism. For us,\r\nthis means that the international community has made\r\nprogress, by recognizing that in countries such as Peru\r\nterrorist groups are the primary, the true, violators of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nIn the current context of renewal, we supported the\r\ncreation of the post of United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, in an effort to improve\r\nUnited Nations measures to prevent and monitor\r\nviolations of human rights, whether the violators be\r\ngovernment agents or others. It is a matter of pride for\r\nour region that a distinguished Latin American diplomat\r\nis the first to fill this high office.\r\nWithin this chamber last year, the President of Peru\r\nannounced that the leader of the bloodiest terrorist\r\nmovement in the Western Hemisphere - caught as a result\r\nof our successful campaign for national peace - had\r\nacknowledged in writing the clear defeat of his totalitarian\r\naims and his bloodthirsty methods. Today I am pleased\r\nto confirm that Peru is swiftly progressing towards\r\nreconciliation and peace. The Peruvian strategy, which\r\ninvolves the State and civil society, has borne fruit, as\r\nevidenced by the mass desertions of terrorists as a result\r\nof the \"repentance law\" passed on repentance and the\r\nreturn of peaceful villagers to their homes, with the\r\nsupport and backing of the State.\r\nMy country, having guaranteed democracy and\r\neconomic freedom, now has, after many years, excellent\r\nprospects. We have established a new national\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nenvironment by consistently applying economic, social and\r\npacification policies. The results prove that we have taken\r\nthe correct path, as shown by the growth in gross national\r\nproduct - 7 per cent last year, and projected to be between\r\n9 per cent and 10 per cent this year, figures which\r\nconstitute the highest growth rates in the hemisphere.\r\nThis new situation will allow us, for the first time in\r\ndecades, to give social issues the priority they deserve. The\r\neconomic policies followed in Peru have made possible a\r\nsocial programme implemented through non-inflationary\r\ninvestment, with our own resources. This programme has\r\nthe technical backing of international financial institutions\r\nand is in line with the conceptual approaches on social\r\ndevelopment promoted by the World Bank, the United\r\nNations Development Programme and a growing number of\r\nnon-governmental organizations that share a belief in\r\nputting the human being at the core of development efforts.\r\nTo do otherwise would be to make sustainable long-term\r\ngrowth impossible. This essential task for the whole of\r\nPeruvian society requires the cooperation and support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMy country’s contribution to change in the world has\r\nbeen made possible by the efforts of our people, who have\r\nenabled us to enjoy internal peace, security, stability and\r\neconomic growth. The path we are taking leads the most\r\ntenacious nation in South America, a people of long-proven\r\ncreativity, on the threshold of a new millennium with the\r\nenthusiasm, the ability and the necessary tools for its\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Peru for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Goldenberg Schreiber, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Peru,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Federal Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Austria, His Excellency\r\nMr. Alois Mock.\r\nMr. Mock (Austria) (interpretation from French):\r\nAllow me to congratulate the President sincerely on his\r\nelection to preside over the forty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am particularly pleased to see a\r\nrepresentative of a French-speaking African country occupy\r\nthis important position. We trust that the forty-ninth\r\nsession will, under his enlightened leadership, pay special\r\nattention to the political, economic and social problems\r\nfacing his continent, so sorely tried over these last few\r\nyears.\r\nNext year the United Nations will celebrate its\r\nfiftieth anniversary with a series of activities throughout\r\nthe world. The image of the United Nations in the eyes\r\nof world public opinion will depend largely on its status,\r\non the extent to which it has remained faithful, 50 years\r\nafter its founding, to the principles of the San Francisco\r\nCharter, which are still valid.\r\nI believe it must be a priority to strengthen the world\r\nOrganization in the spirit of Article 1 of the Charter, so\r\nthat it can effectively carry out its mission of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. Let us also recall here\r\nthe words of the great philosopher, Sir Karl Popper,\r\nrecently deceased, who wrote: \"Our primary objective\r\nmust be peace. But we must not hesitate to wage war for\r\npeace.\" We have given the United Nations the\r\nresponsibility of deciding when to use force to preserve\r\npeace. This weighty responsibility has to be exercised\r\nwhen necessary.\r\nThe Security Council is of paramount importance in\r\npreserving peace in the world. In order to maintain and\r\nstrengthen the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Security\r\nCouncil, Austria advocates a slight increase in its\r\nmembership. Every Member of the United Nations must\r\nbe able to see and understand how views develop within\r\nthat body. They must all be able to feel sure that\r\ndiscussions in the Council take account of the views of\r\ninterested countries, for example, countries contributing\r\ntroops for peace-keeping operations.\r\nThe importance of the United Nations must be\r\npreserved and developed, not only as a system for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, but also\r\nas a forum for discussion and an instrument for\r\ncoordination at the global level. On the first point, much\r\nremains to be done. In the social and economic sphere\r\nand in the field of development, important progress has\r\nbeen made, notably with the reform of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, which has permitted better guidance of\r\noperational activities for development.\r\nA solid financial basis is absolutely vital to the\r\neffective discharge of the United Nations mission. Non-\r\npayment or late payment of mandatory contributions by\r\nMember States is a violation of the Charter and of the\r\nduty of international solidarity. The burden thus created\r\nfalls, above all, on those Members that are called good\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\npayers and those that provide troops, expenditures that are\r\nreimbursed by the United Nations only after considerable\r\ndelay. This chronic problem, which is getting worse, can\r\nbe resolved only by timely and full payment of mandatory\r\ncontributions by all Member States. As one of the 20\r\ncountries that, in 1994, paid their full contribution in a\r\ntimely fashion to the regular budget of the United Nations,\r\nand as a regular participant in peace-keeping operations,\r\nAustria will, along with the Secretariat and other interested\r\ndelegations, seek a solution to this difficult problem.\r\nOn the eve of its fiftieth anniversary the United\r\nNations faces new challenges at the world level.\r\nSustainable development, the monitoring of world\r\npopulation growth, the elimination of poverty, the creation\r\nof opportunities for productive employment, social\r\nintegration, equality for women, better protection of human\r\nrights, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons - all are major\r\nthemes of our era and have been or will be the subject of\r\ninternational conferences. The task of the United Nations\r\nis to draw the necessary conclusions from the results of\r\nthese conferences and to define the outlines of sustainable\r\nhuman development at the world level. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reports, \"An Agenda for Peace\" and \"Agenda for\r\nDevelopment\", are essential elements in a discussion that\r\nhas already led to a broader understanding of the idea of\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe protection and promotion of human rights is one\r\nof the central tasks of the United Nations. The\r\naccomplishment of this task has benefited from the vital\r\nimpetus provided by the Vienna Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action. While we can be pleased with the\r\noutcome of the World Conference on Human Rights, the\r\nlasting impact of the final document of Vienna will none\r\nthe less be measured by the continuing will of the\r\ncommunity of nations to give effect to its provisions more\r\nrapidly and to guarantee them more effectively than in the\r\npast.\r\nA crucial role is to be played in this connection by the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. Austria welcomes\r\nthe swift implementation of this central provision of the\r\nVienna document. In the few months that he has occupied\r\nhis post, Mr. José Ayala Lasso has fully lived up to the\r\nexpectations arising out of his difficult and important\r\nmandate. His official visit to Vienna began a dialogue with\r\nall Governments. It seems to us a matter of priority to\r\npromote coordination of international protection of human\r\nrights within the United Nations system, and in this the\r\nHigh Commissioner will, of course, have a determining role\r\nto play. We should also strengthen the various mechanisms\r\nfor protecting human rights, as well as the role of the\r\nSpecial Rapporteurs. This should make it possible to\r\nreact more quickly to violations of human rights and to\r\nprevent them more effectively. The resources needed for\r\nthe High Commissioner’s work should be provided as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nEffective protection of human rights is not only a\r\nduty towards each individual; it is also an essential\r\ncontribution to ensuring stability, development and\r\nsecurity. History teaches us that we must resolutely\r\noppose all flagrant violations of human rights, such as\r\ngenocide in the Nazi concentration camps or by the\r\nKhmer Rouge, as soon as they are brought to light. This\r\nmakes it all the more difficult to understand that the\r\nresolution adopted by the United Nations Conference on\r\nHuman Rights relating to Bosnia and Herzegovina has\r\nremained a dead letter, thereby jeopardizing the credibility\r\nof our world Organization.\r\nMr. Choi Su Hon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nIn this connection, I wish to pay a particular tribute\r\nto Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, former Prime Minister of\r\nPoland and Special Rapporteur of the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights, for his excellent work, of which the world\r\ncommunity should be proud. I would also hail President\r\nIzetbegović of Bosnia and Herzegovina who, with great\r\nself-discipline and in a very constructive spirit, has\r\naccepted to speak with those who are committing a kind\r\nof genocide against his people. This is remarkable\r\nconduct from an extraordinary individual.\r\nThe effective protection of minorities involves great\r\ndifficulties in many countries. I am pleased to be able to\r\ninform the Assembly that, in 1992, Austria and Italy were\r\nable to resolve their dispute over the Southern Tyrol. The\r\ndispute related to the implementation of the 1946 Treaty\r\nof Paris on the situation of the German-speaking and\r\nLadino-speaking populations in Southern Tyrol. It was\r\nalso dealt with in General Assembly resolutions 1497\r\n(XV) and 1661 (XVI), adopted at the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth sessions respectively.\r\nThe solution that was agreed to by both sides was to\r\nestablish relatively comprehensive autonomy in southern\r\nTyrol. This seemed on the whole to be an adequate basis\r\nfor ensuring the continued existence of the German-\r\nspeaking and Ladino minorities.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nGiven the constant changes in the atmosphere -\r\nparticularly the economic and financial atmosphere - there\r\nhas to be a dynamic autonomy if its objective is to be\r\nattained. This will require ongoing flexibility and\r\nunderstanding on the part of the relevant authorities. A\r\nsolution to the minorities problem on the basis of territorial\r\nautonomy must, over the long term, aim at ensuring that all\r\nthose who live together under the same roof view such\r\nautonomy as a positive thing that protects their respective\r\ninterests.\r\nThe unanimous statements made by Prime Minister\r\nBerlusconi, Foreign Minister Martino and Interior Minister\r\nMaroni that they would not touch the autonomy of southern\r\nTyrol seem to us to be a guarantee that we shall continue\r\non the same road.\r\nAustria is proud, as one of the headquarters countries\r\nof the United Nations, to host a number of important\r\nprogrammes that meet the immediate interests of the\r\nindividual and also have a decisive impact on international\r\nrelations. These include protection from drug abuse, the\r\nstruggle against crime, questions on the use and control of\r\nnuclear power and on the preservation of the system for the\r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons - all of these are\r\nmajor activities of the United Nations at Vienna, as is\r\ninternational cooperation on outer space and on the\r\npromotion of international industrial development.\r\nFollowing recent political changes, important new\r\nareas for United Nations activities have emerged in Eastern\r\nEurope and Central Asia. Vienna sees itself as an\r\nimportant point for coordinating activities to support and\r\nassist those States as they move towards democracy, a state\r\nof law and a market economy.\r\nOn the eve of its fiftieth anniversary, the United\r\nNations currently has more than 70,000 people in 17\r\ndifferent peace-keeping operations. More than three times\r\nthe regular budget is being devoted to those operations.\r\nAustria, which has been involved for decades in such\r\noperations, is aware of the enormous challenge that this\r\nposes to the United Nations and its Member States in terms\r\nof funds, personnel and organization.\r\nOne of the most important events to take place within\r\nthe framework of the activities organized in Austria in\r\nconnection with the fiftieth anniversary will be the very\r\nhigh-level conference set for early March 1995 in Vienna.\r\nThis conference will be devoted to the discussion, analysis\r\nand preparation of recommendations on how best to take up\r\nthe challenge of measures to preserve peace on the eve of\r\nthe new millennium. I am particularly pleased and\r\ngrateful that the Secretary-General has been kind enough\r\nto agree to deliver the opening address in Austria.\r\nAustria is in favour of strengthening civilian peace-\r\nkeeping operations and of stepping up United Nations\r\nactivities in preventive diplomacy. Thus, the Austrian\r\nFederal Government has established, in the city of\r\nSchlaining, a centre for civilian peace-keeping operations.\r\nThis year, we held our second seminar on the re-\r\nestablishment of peace and on preventive diplomacy, a\r\nseminar in which high officials of the United Nations\r\nparticipated. Also in Schlaining, we have a regular\r\ntraining programme, with international participation, for\r\ncivilian international operations relating to peace-keeping\r\nand peace-building.\r\nFor a quarter of a century, the non-proliferation\r\nTreaty has successfully prevented the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons and has also successfully prevented the\r\nabuse of nuclear power for military purposes. The 1995\r\nReview Conference will take a decision on extending the\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty. Our common goal must be the\r\nunconditional and unrestricted extension of the Treaty.\r\nAustria also has good reason to hope that the substantive\r\nnegotiations currently under way in the Conference on\r\nDisarmament with a view to the conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty will lead to nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nAs the host country of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency, Austria is aware of the importance of\r\nthis control mechanism for the application of the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty. The success of any future agreement\r\non a nuclear-test ban will, in the final analysis, depend on\r\nthe effectiveness of the work done by organizations\r\nresponsible for its implementation and verification.\r\nA year ago, the Austrian Federal Government\r\ndecided to offer Vienna as headquarters for the future\r\norganization to be established under the nuclear-test-ban\r\ntreaty, and I would wish to extend this invitation again\r\ntoday before the General Assembly.\r\nThis year once again, our hopes of seeing an end to\r\nthe fighting in the territory of the former Yugoslavia have\r\nbeen dashed. Despite international initiatives and peace\r\nplans, the actual prospects for an equitable and lasting\r\nsolution are not very good. The reconciliation between\r\nthe Bosnian Croats and the Bosnians, which stemmed\r\nfrom the Washington Agreements, should not make us\r\nforget that the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina continues\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nto leave innumerable victims in its wake. The toll of dead\r\nand displaced persons grows daily more terrible. The\r\naggressor has gone so far as to attack or lay siege to cities\r\nthat have been declared United Nations protected areas.\r\nDespite repeated international condemnation, the\r\nSerbian side has continued its practice of \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\". Austria strongly condemns these crimes,\r\nwherever and by whomever they may be perpetrated, and\r\nwe shall never stop calling for an end to such practices.\r\nBasic principles of the international order continue to\r\nbe trampled underfoot and lose their credibility. Specific\r\nresolutions such as those on military guarantees for\r\nprotected areas or return of refugees to their home, have not\r\nyet been implemented. All international initiatives and\r\nefforts for the repatriation of refugees have been made a\r\nmockery by \"ethnic cleansing\", which continues to be\r\npractised and, in the final analysis, continues to be tolerated\r\nat the international level. The arms embargo imposed by\r\nthe Security Council in September 1991 has a unilateral\r\nimpact, to the detriment of those countries that have taken\r\nover from the former Yugoslavia and that are threatened by\r\nSerbian ambitions. And so we have arrived at a situation\r\nwhere the legitimate Government of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is unable fully to exercise its right to\r\nlegitimate self-defence, while at the same time that State\r\ncannot even benefit from adequate protection under the\r\nsystem of collective security. On the other hand, we do not\r\nsee any attempt on the Serbian side to abandon the idea of\r\na Greater Serbia based on the illegal conquest of territories\r\nby force. This can be seen from the fact that the peace\r\nplans prepared by the European Union and the contact\r\ngroup have still not been accepted by the Serbian side,\r\nalthough on many points they do respond to their\r\naspirations.\r\nIn its resolution 943 (1994) of 23 September the\r\nSecurity Council set forth the conditions for a suspension\r\nof sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\n(Serbia and Montenegro). The Belgrade Government must\r\nallow international observers to control the blockade against\r\nthe Bosnian Serbs. The observer Mission now being\r\nestablished along the Serbo-Bosnian border is, as Austria\r\nsees it, a step in the right direction but, and I stress the\r\npoint, it remains to be seen how effectively the Mission\r\nwill be able to carry out its task and whether credible\r\nconsequences will in fact be drawn from the conclusions\r\narrived at by the observers.\r\nIn Croatia also the situation remains largely\r\nunchanged: contrary to the provisions of the 1992 Vance\r\nplan which was approved by the Security Council, more\r\nthan one quarter of the country remains in the hands of\r\nthe rebel Serbs. So far there has been neither\r\ndemilitarization of these regions under the supervision of\r\nthe United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troops\r\nnor has it yet been possible for the civilian population to\r\nreturn. Recent protests show to what extent the situation\r\nhas become untenable for displaced persons within\r\nCroatia.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of the extremely harsh\r\njudgements often pronounced on Croatia one must not\r\nforget the very clear terms of the legal opinions of the\r\nBadinter Commission in January 1992. From these texts\r\nit is clear that, in principle, Croatia met all the conditions\r\nset forth by the European Union for recognition of new\r\nStates in Eastern Europe. I realize that in some areas,\r\nsuch as administration, practices vis-à-vis the minorities\r\nand the media, improvements are still much to be desired.\r\nBut we should not measure Croatia by different and\r\nharsher criteria than the criteria we use for other countries\r\nin central and south-eastern Europe because we have\r\ngreater access to Croatia and because there are more\r\ntransparent structures there, and there is no other country\r\nin Europe, apart from Bosnia and Herzegovina, that has\r\nbeen subjected for years to a violent military attack with\r\nwhich it has to cope under extremely difficult conditions.\r\nThe situation in Kosovo, which has been too\r\nneglected because of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nis continuing to deteriorate. The Belgrade authorities\r\nhave pursued their systematic action against the Albanian\r\nmajority of the population. There is still a danger that\r\nmass violence may erupt. Observer missions sent by the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(CSCE) which were expelled in 1993 have not been\r\nauthorized to return despite intensive international efforts\r\nto that end. In that region, which is almost 90 per cent\r\ninhabited by Albanians and has been fully autonomous\r\nduring the past couple of decades, we are witnessing the\r\nexercise of a kind of power that is tantamount to that of\r\nan occupying regime.\r\nThe situation in former Yugoslavia shows that what\r\nthe great French philosopher, Blaise Pascal, said in his\r\nPensées remains as true as ever. He said that justice\r\nwithout force was powerless and that force without justice\r\nwas tyrannical. The collective security system of the\r\nUnited Nations which is part of the post-war order, has\r\nnot really been applied by the international community in\r\nthe case of the conflict in former Yugoslavia. The hope\r\nthat the collective security system would be used as an\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\ninstrument of peace following its successful use after the\r\nIraqi invasion of Kuwait has proved disappointing.\r\nUnfortunately, Bosnia and Herzegovina is not an\r\nisolated case. It would be a serious mistake not to mention,\r\nat least, some other tragedies - Rwanda, Angola,\r\nAfghanistan, Haiti, Tajikistan, and so on. There is too long\r\na list of hotbeds of crisis and violence, where the law of the\r\nstrongest tramples underfoot the principles of the Charter of\r\nSan Francisco. At the same time we must draw strength\r\nand optimism from some positive developments, historic in\r\ntheir significance. I may mention, for example, free and\r\ndemocratic elections in South Africa, an end to the policy\r\nof apartheid, autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, and an end to\r\nthe state of war between Jordan and Israel. In South Africa\r\nand in the Middle East age-old objectives of the United\r\nNations have finally been attained or are about to be\r\nattained. Austria, in so far as it can, actively supports these\r\npeaceful processes, not only in the interests of the peoples\r\nconcerned but also in the interests of greater hope of\r\nresolving other similar problems.\r\nThe year 1994 is of historic significance to Austria.\r\nA huge majority - 66.58 per cent - of the Austrian people\r\ncame out firmly in support of joining the European Union,\r\na community of States that holds the same values as, and\r\nplays an increasingly important role in, the United Nations.\r\nThis was the largest support in a European State for the\r\nidea of European integration.\r\nWith that democratic force we will continue to support\r\nthis goal, and - as of 1 January I hope - as a member of\r\nthis community we will contribute in a spirit of solidarity\r\nand openness to the attainment of the objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations as we have done in the past.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Oman,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah.\r\nMr. Abdullah (Oman) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nMr. President, please allow me at the outset to congratulate\r\nyou on your assumption of the Presidency of the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election\r\nto this high office attests to the respect accorded by the\r\ninternational community to your friendly country, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire. We are confident, in view of your qualifications\r\ncredentials and diplomatic skills, that you will steer the\r\nwork of this session to a successful conclusion which will\r\nfurther the noble causes and principles of the United\r\nNations, which are aimed at bringing peace and prosperity\r\nto the world. I would like to assure you of my delegation’s\r\ncooperation with your endeavours to achieve this common\r\ngoal.\r\nI should like also to take this opportunity to express\r\nour appreciation to His Excellency Samuel R. Insanally,\r\nthe Permanent Representative of the friendly country of\r\nGuyana, for the exemplary manner in which he presided\r\nover the work of the previous session of the General\r\nAssembly. Furthermore, on behalf of the Government of\r\nthe Sultanate of Oman, I should like to pay special tribute\r\nto the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedicated and\r\ncontinued efforts aimed at resolving complicated conflicts\r\nby peaceful means.\r\nThis forty-ninth session is being held amid\r\nincreasing prospects for and optimism about the creation\r\nof a world in which atmosphere of peace, interdependence\r\nand peaceful settlement of disputes will prevail. Our\r\nArab region is currently witnessing radical and important\r\nchanges where hatred and animosities between the Arabs\r\nand Israel are slowly vanishing and giving place to a new\r\nclimate of understanding, dialogue and coexistence.\r\nWe are totally convinced that there is no alternative\r\nmeans by which the Arabs and Israel may resolve their\r\ndifferences other than negotiation. While some promising\r\nand positive results have been achieved, we are still at the\r\nbeginning of a long process and we have a long way to\r\ngo towards resolving deep-seated differences. We\r\ntherefore appeal to the international community to\r\ncontinue to lend its support to the efforts aimed at\r\nbringing peace and security to the region.\r\nIn South Africa, my country has participated with\r\nmany other countries of the world in the inauguration\r\nceremony of President Nelson Mandela. That historic\r\nevent could not have taken place were it not for the\r\ncourageous policies of both President Mandela and Vice\r\nPresident de Klerk in their approach to power-sharing\r\nbased on equality.\r\nThanks to the positive steps taken and the wise\r\npolicies pursued by President Mandela in forming a\r\nNational Coalition government that embraces various\r\npolitical parties, South Africa has been able to resume its\r\nrightful place in this Assembly, and can now play its\r\nnatural role in regional and international forums.\r\nIn Mozambique, the peace process is making\r\nsignificant progress. Moreover, we are witnessing an\r\nincreasing normalization of relations amongst Asian\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\ncountries. We also witness more integration and\r\ninterdependence in the economic relations in Europe and in\r\nNorth America. And last but not least, we note with\r\nsatisfaction the peaceful resolution of conflicts in Latin\r\nAmerica and the unprecedented tendency of its peoples to\r\nopt for peace, development, and social and economic\r\nbetterment in their countries.\r\nWe have to cover a lot of ground before we achieve\r\nthe building of the world envisaged by the Charter of this\r\nOrganization. The prevailing climate of concord affords us\r\nan opportunity to enable this Organization to face up to the\r\nchallenges and unresolved problems and to address such\r\nproblems in the light of the new realities.\r\nMy country views with satisfaction the steps that have\r\nbeen achieved so far on the Palestinian-lsraeli track. We\r\nhave always called for a just, lasting and peaceful solution\r\nto the situation between the Arabs and Israel through direct\r\nnegotiations. Therefore, my country has welcomed the\r\noutcome of the Palestinian-lsraeli negotiations which\r\nculminated in the signing of the Cairo Agreement on the\r\nimplementation of self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.\r\nThis Agreement is now being implemented, the Palestinian\r\nAuthority is now a concrete reality and is exercising its\r\ndifferent functions in such areas as education, health,\r\ntaxation, tourism and social affairs. There are other\r\nfunctions stipulated in the Agreement which, we hope, will\r\nbe exercised at the earliest possible time, by the Palestinian\r\nAuthority. The expansion of the competence of the\r\nPalestinian Authority to other Palestinian areas in the West\r\nBank will undoubtedly strengthen the peace process and\r\ncontribute positively to security and stability in the area.\r\nSuch significant steps could never have been achieved\r\nhad not the Palestinian Liberation Organization honoured its\r\nobligations under the Declaration of Principles signed in\r\nWashington and under the Cairo Agreement. In order to\r\nachieve peace and enable the Palestinian people to take\r\nadvantage and reap the benefits of the vigorous efforts\r\nexerted in this context, the international community should\r\nextend the necessary assistance to the Palestinian Authority\r\nso that it may be able to discharge its many responsibilities\r\nand rebuild the infrastructure, which has been severely\r\ndamaged. Support for the Authority will not only serve the\r\ncause of security and stability in the self-rule areas alone\r\nbut in the region of the Middle East in its entirety.\r\nThe desired just and lasting peace will prevail only\r\nthrough complete withdrawal by Israel from the entirety of\r\nthe occupied Arab territories, in accordance with Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\r\n425 (1978), and in application of the land-for-peace\r\nprinciple.\r\nMy country has followed with interest another\r\nsignificant step in the peace process, namely that on the\r\nJordan-lsraeli track, which was highlighted by the signing\r\nby His Majesty King Hussein of Jordan and the Israeli\r\nPrime Minister of a declaration that ends the state of war\r\nbetween the two countries and masks the movement\r\ntowards the establishment of a comprehensive peace. My\r\ncountry has supported these positive and important steps.\r\nMindful of the fact that comprehensive peace is an\r\naspiration of the present and future generations, we\r\nemphasize the critical importance of a complete Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Jordanian territories. We\r\nbelieve that it is crucial for Israel to demonstrate the\r\nnecessary flexibility to reach an agreement on the\r\nquestion of water in order for both countries to move\r\nforward towards the long-awaited lasting peace.\r\nWe look forward to similar positive and important\r\nsteps in the peace process on both the Syrian-Israeli and\r\nLebanese-Israeli tracks. We are confident that the co-\r\nsponsors of the Middle East peace process as well as the\r\nparties concerned are fully aware of the fact that unless\r\nsignificant and substantive progress is made on those two\r\ntracks, the peace process will remain incomplete and will\r\nmake the region’s peoples prey to suspicions, mistrust and\r\ninstability. Therefore, efforts must be made in the\r\ncoming phase, to achieve concrete progress in this\r\ndirection. Israel must declare its readiness to withdraw\r\ncompletely from the Syrian Golan Heights and from the\r\nLebanese territories it now occupies. We are confident\r\nthat if Israel were to take such an undoubtedly positive\r\nstep in the peace process, the peoples of the Middle East\r\nwould be able to work together towards the consolidation\r\nof peace and the promotion of economic development on\r\na large scale in the region.\r\nMindful of the need to support the peace process and\r\ngiven the awareness that national and regional security are\r\ninseparable, the Sultanate of Oman has actively\r\nparticipated in the meetings of the five working groups\r\nemanating from the multilateral negotiations. Although\r\nthe latter are no substitute for bilateral negotiations, they\r\nconstitute a significant tributary that has the potential of\r\ngiving a rather significant boost to the process in the\r\ndirection of the desired just and comprehensive peace in\r\nthe Middle East.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nGiven the pivotal importance of water resources for\r\nthe future security and peace of the Middle East, the\r\nSultanate of Oman accords a very high priority to the\r\ndiscovery and development of new water resources side by\r\nside with the promotion of sea-water desalination\r\ntechnology in order to make such technology more cost\r\neffective. Within the framework of multilateral negotiations\r\nin the Middle East, my country hosted the fifth meeting of\r\nthe Working Group on Water Resources held from 17 to 20\r\nApril 1994. The meeting resulted, inter alia, in the\r\nendorsement of the Omani proposal to establish in Muscat,\r\nthe Omani capital, a regional centre for the research aimed\r\nat the development of desalination technology.\r\nGiven the great significance we attach to the\r\nestablishment of that centre, as it will have a decidedly\r\npositive impact on the economic development of the States\r\nof the Middle East, we look forward to the cooperation of\r\nall in this regard in order to make the transfer of water-\r\nresources technology cost effective to the region so as to\r\nhelp in raising the standards of social and economic\r\ndevelopment and, thereby, in consolidating the peace and\r\nstability of the region.\r\nWe in the Gulf region are committed to the\r\nachievement of the highest level of stability, cooperation\r\nand development in all our countries and to the\r\ndevelopment of our multilateral and bilateral relations. This\r\nnaturally embraces the settlement of all bilateral differences.\r\nConsequently, we view with satisfaction the agreement\r\nbetween the State of Bahrain and the State of Qatar to have\r\nrecourse to the International Court of Justice with regard to\r\ntheir differences over the disputed islands and the maritime\r\nborders. We also hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nand the United Arab Emirates would settle their differences\r\nregarding the islands of Abu Moussa, the Greater Tumb and\r\nthe Lesser Tumb as soon as possible, in an amicable and\r\npeaceful fashion. This could include having recourse to\r\ninternational arbitration in view of the mutual interests the\r\ntwo countries share in various spheres. There is no doubt\r\nthat such regional efforts will contribute to the\r\nconsolidation of regional security and serve the cause of\r\ninternational peace.\r\nWe have noted recently that there has been\r\nconsiderable progress in Iraq’s implementation of the\r\nresolutions relating to the destruction of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, particularly the agreement on the installation of\r\na long-term monitoring system, which should now be put\r\ninto effect for a suitable period. In the meantime, the\r\nSecurity Council should proceed to make the necessary\r\ncontacts with both Iraq and Kuwait to implement its\r\nresolution 833 (1993) regarding the demarcation of\r\ninternational borders between the two countries through\r\nthe acceptance and legal ratification by the parties in\r\naccordance with established international norms and\r\npractices in matters relating to international borders.\r\nWe believe that it is an opportune time to take more\r\npositive steps to enable Iraq to perform its regional and\r\ninternational role in a peaceful context and to help the\r\nbrotherly Iraqi people to put behind it the years of\r\nembargo and to make up for what it has lost in terms of\r\nsocial and economic development.\r\nThe future of the region should be based on the\r\nconviction that it is imperative for States to develop and\r\nfurther their relations and to overcome their outstanding\r\ndifferences in a manner that safeguards the interests of all\r\nparties.\r\nThe interdependent nature of today’s world makes it\r\nimpossible for States to pursue an individualistic approach\r\nthat disregards the interests of others. We therefore\r\nbelieve that the peaceful conduct of relations and the\r\npursuit of constructive political dialogue are the best\r\nguarantees for present and future security and stability in\r\nthe region.\r\nWe aspire after a more stable, more developed world\r\nthat would be totally free from ethnic and regional\r\nconflicts, a world that would be able to ensure the\r\nprogress of mankind towards a better way of life by\r\nchannelling the disposable economic resources to the\r\nfinancing of scientific research which may benefit social\r\nand economic development. While we are fully aware of\r\nthe fact that the international community has made real\r\nprogress in changing to the better in many important\r\nareas, it is nevertheless regrettable that there remain many\r\nfactors which make other parts of the world prey to\r\npolitical, ethnic and regional conflicts. It is now\r\nabundantly clear that the United Nations is losing its\r\nability to address all these crises. While we sympathize\r\nwith the sufferings of many peoples that are victims of\r\nsuch crises, we believe it is high time the international\r\ncommunity set up a new and unambiguous rule that\r\nshould be followed in dealing with such problems. It is\r\nevident that the present mechanisms available to the\r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations are\r\nno longer able to perform their humanitarian role. It is\r\nnot possible for the United Nations to go on feeding\r\nwhole peoples indefinitely, and it is, therefore, high time\r\nfor the leaders of countries immersed in such tensions and\r\nconflicts to realize that the United Nations will not be\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nresponsible for their actions towards their peoples, and that\r\nthe States of the international community are no longer able\r\nto rebuild for them what they themselves have destroyed.\r\nFunds should not be made available to rebuild countries\r\nwhich destroy their own infrastructures with their own\r\nhands. All peoples should contribute effectively to the\r\ndevelopment of the world economy rather than be a burden\r\non it.\r\nThe United Nations cannot play a peace-keeping role\r\nin each and every conflict that erupts in the world. Peace-\r\nkeeping forces should not be dragged into regional conflicts\r\nexcept to the extent to which regional organizations and\r\nStates are willing to shoulder their full responsibility in this\r\nregard. If deemed necessary, this should take place only\r\nfollowing the consent of the parties to conflict and on the\r\nbasis of clear goals and mandates linked to a definite time-\r\nframe.\r\nRegional organizations have a vital role to play in the\r\nresolution of the disputes that exist in many parts of the\r\nworld. Although that role parallels and is complementary\r\nto the efforts of the United Nations, we have noted that,\r\nregardless of how important and necessary it is, it is almost\r\nnon-existent in the political arena. While we value the\r\nefforts of the peace-keeping forces in Somalia, we believe\r\nit would have been possible to avoid the negative aspects\r\nthat became evident in that operation had full use been\r\nmade of the Organization of African Unity, the competent\r\nregional organization qualified to bring about national\r\nreconciliation and the establishment of national authority.\r\nThe United Nations could have lent a helping hand by\r\nproviding expertise and advice, as well as political,\r\nfinancial and humanitarian support.\r\nRegional arrangements, whether in Asia, Africa or in\r\nany other continent, in no way detract from the role of the\r\nSecurity Council as the principal body responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Rather,\r\nsuch regional arrangements could help lighten the Council’s\r\nworkload and instil a sense of partnership and a spirit of\r\ncaring into international affairs.\r\nAs the possibility of the failure of some peace-keeping\r\noperations cannot be ruled out, it is necessary to face the\r\nfacts and to draw object lessons from them if the United\r\nNations is to avoid sliding into the repetition of the same\r\nmistakes.\r\nTragic events are taking place in Rwanda as a result\r\nof the continuing political and ethnic strife that has led to\r\nthe outbreak of violence, to the horrendous massacres,\r\nwhich claimed hundreds of thousands of innocent lives,\r\nand to the destruction of the infrastructure of that\r\ncountry’s economy. Great numbers of Rwanda’s people\r\nare now living in refugee camps in neighbouring countries\r\nunder unimaginably tragic circumstances. Hunger and\r\ndisease claim the lives of hundreds daily. In view of this\r\nhorrendous suffering, my country calls upon the\r\nRwandese parties to stop the bloodshed and work towards\r\nnational reconciliation in accordance with the Arusha\r\nPeace Agreement so that peace and stability may be\r\nrestored in Rwanda.\r\nThe mediation efforts undertaken so far to bring\r\nabout peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina have proven to be\r\ninsufficient, due mainly to the imbalance of power\r\nbetween the Bosnian parties. The main cause of\r\nimbalance in this regard is the denial to the people of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina of their right to fight for their\r\nexistence through the imposition of a comprehensive arms\r\nembargo on that small State, in total disregard of its right\r\nof self-defence enshrined in Article 51 of the United\r\nNations Charter. The arms embargo should be imposed\r\non the aggressor. And who is the aggressor in the\r\nBosnian case? All the facts available to the United\r\nNations and its agencies regarding the situation in\r\nSarajevo and in other Bosnian cities prove that the Serbs\r\nare the aggressors, and in the most inhuman terms.\r\nWhile my country welcomes the structural reforms\r\nundertaken with a view to ensuring the optimum\r\nutilization of the resources available to the United Nations\r\nwith the greatest degree of efficiency and flexibility, it\r\nfeels that the ability of the Organization to discharge its\r\nduties and perform its role depends to a very large extent\r\non the willingness of the Member States to live up to one\r\nof the main responsibilities of membership - the prompt\r\npayment of their financial contributions, including their\r\nprompt contribution to peace-keeping operations.\r\nAs we approach the second summit meeting of the\r\nSecurity Council, we ought to accord due attention to the\r\nissue of the expansion of the Council’s membership in\r\naccordance with the different trends prevailing in the\r\nworld, while constantly preserving the principle of\r\nequitable geographic balance without prejudice to the\r\nlevel of decision-making in the Council. We therefore\r\nsubscribe to the view that no hasty decision should be\r\ntaken in this respect and that more time should be given\r\nto the regional groups to expound their views in this\r\nregard.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nMy country has noted with satisfaction the successful\r\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round and the long-range\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1994 and the\r\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization. This has\r\nhelped prevent the world economic order’s turning into a\r\nhotbed of tension and strife between the various regions.\r\nHowever, my country and the developing countries in\r\ngeneral, some of which have acceded to those agreements\r\nor are in the process of so doing, request that their\r\nparticular circumstances be taken into consideration when\r\nimplementing the new agreements.\r\nIt is expected that our developing countries will have\r\nto make sacrifices in order to support the world economic\r\norder arising out of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs\r\nand Trade, particularly in the short and medium terms.\r\nTherefore, we hope to find support from the new World\r\nTrade Organization that would be proportionate to what we\r\nhave to offer. We are particularly interested in the\r\ndevelopmental aspect of these agreements, as we are\r\ninterested in strengthening and developing the service sector\r\nin our countries through the assistance offered by the\r\nadvanced economies and the international organizations.\r\nIn the area of disarmament, we hope that the\r\ninternational support to the Convention on the Prohibition\r\nof the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\r\nChemical Weapons and on their Destruction will give\r\nimpetus to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to\r\ndraft a comprehensive test-ban treaty that would be an\r\nimportant step towards ridding the world of nuclear terror.\r\nIn this context, we support the efforts aimed at establishing\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones, particularly in the Middle East,\r\nwhich is one of the world’s most sensitive regions.\r\nAt present, thanks to the prevailing spirit of concord\r\nand the ending of the cold war between the East and West,\r\nwe witness a robust movement towards the consolidation of\r\npeace and security. The world is beginning to realize that\r\na climate of concord and harmony is the most viable means\r\nof establishing an international community characterized by\r\nconstructive cooperation and mutual benefit, and that such\r\na development will be in the interest of mankind and its\r\nwell-being.\r\nToday, on the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe founding of the United Nations, we hope that the\r\noutcome of this session will be more compatible with the\r\nprinciple of international partnership and solidarity so that\r\nhumanity may be able to lessen and cure the ailments that\r\nsill undermine the twentieth century and thus ensure that\r\nthe twenty-first century will be a century of hope, peace\r\nand security for all human beings wherever they may be\r\non the face of the Earth.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nnext speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBulgaria, His Excellency Mr. Stanislav Daskalov, on\r\nwhom I now call.\r\nMr. Daskalov (Bulgaria): Let me, on behalf of the\r\nBulgarian delegation, congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I should also like to extend my\r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Ambassador Samuel\r\nInsanally, for his proficiency in presiding over the\r\nforty-eighth session.\r\nDiverse, often conflicting trends and events\r\ncharacterize the present year, which has marked the end\r\nof apartheid in South Africa, a significant breakthrough in\r\nthe Middle East peace process and steps towards a\r\nsettlement of the problems in Northern Ireland. We have\r\nalso witnessed, however, the incredible human tragedy in\r\nRwanda and the continuing bloodshed in Bosnia. New\r\nhotbeds of tension have emerged in some parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nWhat are, in our view, the parameters of the political\r\nsituation in the world, and Europe in particular? Efforts\r\nto build a new world based on the idea of developing the\r\ncollective security system envisaged in the United Nations\r\nCharter have received additional impetus. Universal\r\nstandards for human rights and international mechanisms\r\nfor safeguarding them are being devised. The problems\r\nof population, poverty and the global ecosystem are being\r\naddressed with increasing attention. A concept for\r\nrenewed cooperation for development is being considered\r\nin which peace, the economy, the environment, social\r\njustice and democracy are viewed as aspects of the same\r\nmovement towards a better world.\r\nAt the same time, the elimination of the\r\ncontradictions between the East and the West has been\r\nfollowed by destabilization - temporary, we hope - in\r\nsome regions of the world. Acts of aggressive\r\nnationalism and xenophobia, of violence and terrorism,\r\nare becoming more frequent. The numerous conflicts\r\nbased on national, ethnic and religious intolerance are\r\ndifficult to manage. Among other things, this has\r\ndisturbed the balance between the efforts to maintain\r\ninternational security and the activities in the social and\r\neconomic sphere, against a background of spreading\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nhunger and poverty and the aggravation of economic and\r\nenvironmental problems.\r\nThese global problems have left their mark on\r\nrelations in Europe as in other places. On one hand, new,\r\nhistoric possibilities for wide cooperation between all\r\nEuropean States have opened up in the process of\r\npromoting a common European identity. On the other\r\nhand, new, as well as reawakened, national interests and\r\npolicies are taking shape, and these are interacting with and,\r\nat the same time, counteracting the integration processes.\r\nThe end of the ideological and military confrontation\r\non the old continent has not yet led to the removal of all\r\nbarriers. Europe is still divided into zones that differ in\r\nterms of security and economic welfare. It is desirable that\r\nthis division be overcome, as the problems of the zones\r\nwith less security could be transferred to those with greater\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe global political dimension of the ongoing\r\ntransition to democracy and a market economy in Central\r\nand Eastern Europe has been largely recognized. Despite\r\nthe serious decline in living standards and rising\r\nunemployment, the Bulgarian people voted for transition.\r\nThe process of market-orientated reform that started about\r\nfive years ago is irreversible. Our association with the\r\nEuropean Union is a manifestation of the European\r\norientation of my country’s policy and an expression of the\r\npolitical will to adhere to the universal values of\r\ndemocracy. We are adapting our economic, social and\r\ntrade mechanisms to those of the European democracies\r\nand are actively participating in political dialogue with the\r\nEuropean Union. Though slower than we anticipated, the\r\neconomic reforms in Bulgaria are moving ahead.\r\nAs a participant in the Partnership for Peace initiative\r\nof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and as a State\r\nwith associate status in the Western European Union,\r\nBulgaria will contribute to the improvement of cooperation\r\nbetween the Euro-Atlantic and European security\r\ninstitutions and the relevant United Nations structures.\r\nOn the eve of the session of the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Budapest\r\nlater this year, Bulgaria is confident that the high-level\r\nrepresentatives of European countries will come up with\r\nnew ideas to improve the functions of the CSCE, including\r\ncooperation with United Nations.\r\nThe Council of Europe - one of the oldest of the\r\ninternational organizations in Europe - has won recognition\r\nas an organization capable of responding adequately and\r\nin a timely manner to the challenges of our time by\r\npromoting pluralistic democracy, the rule of law and\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nAs Bulgaria currently holds the chairmanship of the\r\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, I\r\nshould like to refer briefly to this body, which already\r\ncomprises 32 members. Nine States have joined since\r\n1989, and nine others are involved in a process of\r\naccession. Cooperation between the Council of Europe\r\nand United Nations institutions and between the Council\r\nand some of the specialized agencies has been developed\r\nover many years and has produced concrete results. This\r\ncooperation has now become triangular - combining the\r\nefforts of the Council of Europe, of the CSCE and of the\r\nUnited Nations. In addition, there is a developing\r\npartnership with the European Union.\r\nIn this complex and interdependent environment the\r\nUnited Nations must increase its capacity to confront the\r\nnew challenges if it is to be effective in peace-making\r\nand in the development of social and economic\r\ncooperation between countries. In this context, important\r\nviews and concepts are contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report \"An Agenda for Peace\", in his\r\nreport on new dimensions of arms regulation and\r\ndisarmament and in his agenda for development.\r\nBulgaria values highly the role of the United Nations\r\nin solving problems directly related to the strengthening\r\nof regional and international security. We support a\r\npeaceful and equitable solution of the conflicts in the\r\nCaucasus region, the Caribbean, Africa and other places.\r\nWe are particularly concerned about the conflict in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, which has become one of the\r\nmost serious challenges facing European States and\r\ninstitutions, the entire civilized world and the international\r\norganizations. We call for an immediate end to the war\r\nand the suffering of the population. A political solution\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina must be based on respect for\r\nthe interests of all parties. There must be compromise\r\nand realism on all sides. In our view, concerted action by\r\nthe participants in the Contact Group is the second\r\nprerequisite for the achievement of a lasting and just\r\nsolution to the conflict.\r\nLet me once again reaffirm the position of Bulgaria\r\non the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. My country will\r\nnot participate, directly or indirectly, in any military\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nactivities on the territory of the former Yugoslavia - not\r\neven under the flag of the United Nations - and we call\r\nupon the other Balkan States to do likewise. \"Restraint\"\r\nshould be the key word for the Balkan region. Bulgaria\r\nwill continue to pursue a constructive and balanced policy\r\nand will not take part in any one or other grouping of\r\nBalkan countries. Thus it will maintain its stabilizing role\r\nin the region.\r\nBulgaria subscribes to the view that in the current\r\ncircumstances it would not be appropriate to lift the arms\r\nembargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina. This, in our\r\nview, would make the conflict even more uncontrollable.\r\nWe welcome the adoption of Security Council\r\nresolutions 941 (1994), 942 (1994) and 943 (1994), which\r\nreflect in a balanced way the current developments in the\r\nregion. We hope that the easing of the sanctions against\r\nSerbia and Montenegro will be followed by the adoption of\r\na responsible policy by the party concerned, thus leading to\r\nfurther normalization of the situation in the region. We\r\nappeal to the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs to accept the\r\nproposed peace settlement and to act in accordance with the\r\nnorms of civilized behaviour.\r\nThe crisis in the former Yugoslavia is directly related\r\nto yet another important problem - that of equitable burden-\r\nsharing, not only in implementing the sanctions imposed by\r\nthe Security Council but also in overcoming their adverse\r\neffect on the economies of third countries. The decision to\r\nabide strictly by the sanctions has not been an easy one for\r\nus. We joined in the sanctions against Serbia and\r\nMontenegro - sanctions mandated by the United Nations -\r\nin the conviction that they are one of the peaceful means by\r\nwhich the international community can contribute to a\r\nsolution of the conflict. The sanctions have, however,\r\ncaused significant direct and indirect losses to my country.\r\nOn three occasions since 1991 - as a result of the sanctions\r\nagainst Iraq, Libya, and Serbia and Montenegro - Bulgaria\r\nhas requested consultations with the Security Council\r\nregarding its special economic problems. Let me point out\r\nthat the adverse effects of the sanctions have came at a\r\ntime of major economic transformation. They distort trade\r\nseriously and hence have a significant negative impact on\r\nthe economy, affecting primarily the emerging private\r\nsector.\r\nMr. Blandino Canto (Dominican Republic), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nAt a time of reorientation of foreign trade within our\r\nEuropean integration policy, the implementation of the\r\nsanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\n(Serbia and Montenegro) has cut off our normal trade\r\nroutes to European markets. The lack of adequate\r\nalternative transport corridors makes our export activity\r\nmuch less competitive and sometimes even impossible.\r\nThe sanctions are far from being the only source of\r\nour problems and difficulties, but they definitely have a\r\nconsiderable negative impact on the overall political,\r\neconomic, security and social situation in my country. I\r\nwould say that the burden of the sanctions exceeds the\r\npoint of reasonable economic and social tolerance in\r\nBulgaria, given the lack of adequate financial, economic\r\nand trade assistance. Urgent measures are imperative to\r\novercome all those negative effects. Bulgaria would\r\nwelcome a more active involvement of international\r\ninstitutions and the developed countries in, for example,\r\nfinancing projects for improving the transport\r\ninfrastructure of the country as part of the alternative\r\nroad, railroad and communication links in Europe.\r\nAnother measure could be the provision of better market\r\naccess for Bulgarian goods and services. We also hope\r\nthat the sanctions Committee established under resolution\r\n724 (1991) will give favourable and timely consideration\r\nto the applications submitted by Bulgarian companies,\r\nespecially those for providing humanitarian aid to the\r\nBulgarian minority in eastern Serbia, whose situation is of\r\nprimary concern to us.\r\nThe United Nations has shown considerable\r\nunderstanding of our difficulties and has given us moral\r\nsupport. I would like to recall the adoption by consensus\r\nof General Assembly resolution 48/210, initiated by\r\nBulgaria and sponsored by a number of countries. We\r\nnow look forward to constructive discussions on the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on this resolution. This should\r\nlead to the General Assembly’s adoption of further\r\nrecommendations for practical steps aimed at assisting\r\nthird countries in alleviating their special economic\r\nproblems.\r\nBulgaria is of the view that in the process of\r\nrestructuring the United Nations account should be taken\r\nof the new political and economic realities of the world,\r\nas well as the specific problems of countries in transition\r\nto a market economy and of small States, while at the\r\nsame time observing the principles of international law\r\nand equality set forth in the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe improvement of interaction between the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the\r\nSecretary-General, as well as the restructuring of the\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nmajor United Nations bodies in the social and economic\r\nsphere, will contribute to reinforcing the role of the United\r\nNations in the pursuit of the necessary balance between\r\npreventive diplomacy, promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and protection of human rights.\r\nBulgaria is following with great interest the ongoing\r\ndiscussion on the question of equitable representation on the\r\nSecurity Council and increasing its membership while\r\npreserving its effectiveness. Our country is ready to\r\nparticipate actively in the search for consensus decisions.\r\nWe believe that the Security Council’s work would be\r\nmuch more effective if, in the decision-making process on\r\nregional issues, the positions of neighbouring countries and\r\nStates concerned, as well as those of the respective regional\r\norganizations, were taken into consideration. This is\r\nparticularly important in cases where the Security Council\r\nconsiders the imposition of economic sanctions. It would\r\nbe useful to prepare and examine in advance a complex\r\nevaluation of the negative effects sanctions would have on\r\nthe economies of neighbouring countries.\r\nThere is also a need for greater transparency in the\r\nactivities of the sanctions Committees. We therefore\r\nsuggest that their meetings should be open to interested\r\nStates. The respective Chairmen could also conduct\r\nbriefings after each meeting to inform the States of the\r\ndecisions taken.\r\nThe States willing to provide contingents for\r\npeace-keeping operations should also be involved in the\r\nSecurity Council deliberations regarding these operations.\r\nIn addition, the recently established practice of holding\r\nregular meetings of the heads of current operations, the\r\nmember States of the Security Council and representatives\r\nof other interested States should be institutionalized,\r\nespecially in cases where the Security Council considers the\r\nmandate, composition and nationality of the contingents\r\ninvolved in a particular peace-keeping operation.\r\nBulgaria supports the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity aimed at preventing the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and at their elimination. At\r\nthe forthcoming Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) review and extension conference, we will\r\nadvocate an indefinite and unconditional extension of the\r\nTreaty. We are also happy to announce that this year\r\nBulgaria ratified the 1993 Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nthe Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\r\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. The\r\nRepublic of Bulgaria will continue to support regional and\r\nglobal initiatives on conventional disarmament and arms\r\ncontrol.\r\nIn today’s world, peace and security, democracy and\r\nsustainable development are inseparable. We therefore\r\nsupport the strengthening of the United Nations role in\r\nthe social and economic field.\r\nThe further liberalization of world trade is an\r\nimportant factor in development. The successful\r\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations provides favourable prospects for wide\r\nliberalization and stable growth of world trade. The\r\nWorld Trade Organization will be of paramount\r\nimportance for the efficient functioning of the global trade\r\nsystem for the benefit of all countries. We expect that\r\nBulgaria will be able to finalize its negotiations on\r\naccession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\r\n(GATT), including the results of the Uruguay Round,\r\nwithin a time-frame that will allow us to become a charter\r\nmember of the World Trade Organization.\r\nBulgaria is interested in taking all possible measures\r\naimed at achieving economic stability through sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Regional cooperation has a considerable\r\nrole in this regard. We hope that the Conference of\r\nMinisters of the Environment of the European countries,\r\nwhich is to take place in 1995 in Sofia, will contribute to\r\nreinforcing the positive trends in the solution of regional\r\nenvironmental problems.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights and\r\ncooperation in the humanitarian field has an especially\r\nimportant place in Bulgaria’s domestic and foreign policy.\r\nWe support the strengthening and promotion of the\r\nUnited Nations monitoring mechanisms in the field of\r\nhuman rights, the establishment of the post of United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the\r\nincreased public awareness regarding human rights in all\r\nparts of the world and the activities of the\r\nnon-governmental organizations. The World Summit on\r\nSocial Development in Copenhagen and the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women in Beijing are expected to give a\r\nmajor impetus to the development and protection of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nNext year we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations. We await it with a sense of\r\nresponsibility and hope. I am confident that the efforts of\r\nthe international community to build a new world security\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nsystem based on the effective maintenance of world peace\r\nand stability, respect for human rights and promotion of the\r\nmarket-economy principles and of universal democratic\r\nvalues will dominate the future of the world Organization.\r\nBulgaria is prepared to contribute to the achievement of\r\nthese goals.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Foreign Trade and Cooperation of Luxembourg,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jacques Poos.\r\nMr. Poos (Luxembourg) (interpretation from French):\r\nAllow me to express my deep pleasure at Mr. Amara\r\nEssy’s election to preside over the General Assembly this\r\nyear. This is a well-deserved tribute to your country, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, which is held in high esteem by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMy distinguished German colleague, Mr. Klaus\r\nKinkel, speaking on behalf of the European Union,\r\nindicated the role it intends to play in international relations\r\nand described its positions on the major political questions.\r\nThese positions are fully shared by my country.\r\nConsequently I will limit my remarks to certain points\r\npertaining to the functioning of our Organization.\r\nOver the past few years, we have lived through the\r\nend of the cold war and far-reaching upheavals in the\r\ninternational arena. These changes have had important and\r\nlasting effects on many people, on the populations of many\r\nStates that lived under authoritarian forms of government\r\nand have now conquered the freedom to exercise their\r\nfundamental rights; on peoples freed of the constraints\r\nimposed upon them by the competition between the two\r\nsuper-Powers, which enabled dictatorial and repressive\r\nregimes to act with full impunity; and, finally, on the\r\ninternational community as a whole, which is no longer\r\nforced to live with the fear of nuclear conflagration\r\nthroughout the planet.\r\nDemocracy has made a historic breakthrough. It will\r\nbe restored in Haiti. In the Middle East the peace process\r\nis making progress. In South Africa apartheid has been\r\ndefinitively abolished, and this shining victory is shared by\r\nour Organizat ion, which fought apartheid\r\nuncompromisingly. Let us give careful thought to the\r\nformidable lesson of political courage, tolerance and\r\nreconciliation given us by Presidents Mandela and de Klerk.\r\nThese advances are offset, however, by the\r\nemergence throughout the world of areas of tension\r\nwhich, no longer masked by a bipolar structure, are now\r\ngrowing in intensity. For three years now war has been\r\nraging in the former Yugoslavia, with an increasing toll\r\nof death, suffering and destruction. In Rwanda, we\r\nwitnessed the unleashing of barbarism, which in a few\r\nmonths killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and\r\nprovoked a refugee problem of exceptional dimensions.\r\nSimilarly, elsewhere - in Africa, the Caucasus, Central\r\nAsia - other regions are faced with new types of conflict,\r\nresulting from the break-up of States and the resurgence\r\nof nationalist, ethnic and religious passions.\r\nNever before has the United Nations found itself so\r\nmuch at the centre of world politics. The United Nations\r\ntoday finds itself forced to face entirely new challenges,\r\nto deal with an ever-growing number of demands and\r\nmissions that are increasingly complex. I hail the\r\ndedication of our Secretary-General, who has persistently\r\ndevoted his energies to the difficult mission of adapting\r\nthe Organization to a new international environment, and\r\nof strengthening it to enable it to fulfil its new tasks. I\r\nwish to pay tribute to the United Nations peace-keeping\r\nforces which have intervened in recent times in an\r\nimpressive number of conflicts. They have contributed,\r\nat times in a decisive manner, to protecting civilian\r\npopulations, to preventing the spread of conflict and to\r\nfacilitating the process of transition to democracy. A\r\nsignificant number of them have given their lives in what\r\nare often highly dangerous operations.\r\nThe growth of peace-keeping operations has been\r\nexponential. In the past five years, the Organization has\r\nlaunched more peace-keeping operations than during the\r\nprevious 40. Moreover, the Organization is now\r\nembarked upon activities which far surpass the traditional\r\npeace-keeping concepts to which we had grown\r\naccustomed. Indeed, most of the recent conflicts have\r\nemerged not between States but within States; the Charter\r\nhardly contemplates such situations. We shall therefore\r\nhave to give thought to the conditions under which the\r\nUnited Nations should act in such cases, and ask\r\nourselves whether it has the necessary resources and\r\ninstruments to fulfil its new missions.\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" provides a framework for\r\nthe future evolution of our Organization in this field of\r\npeace-keeping. A number of the ideas put forward by the\r\nSecretary-General have been constructively put to use by\r\nthe Security Council and by the General Assembly. But\r\nrecent experience has shown us, at times pointedly, that\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nthere are often serious shortcomings to the way in which\r\nthe United Nations conducts these military operations.\r\nMajor operations can no longer be decided upon\r\nspontaneously; in the area of peace-keeping, the United\r\nNations needs to strengthen its organizational, management\r\nand planning capacities. It must be able to rely on a\r\npermanent high command structure capable of\r\nsimultaneously conducting several multi-dimensional large-\r\nscale operations and which has adequate means for\r\ninformation processing and coordination.\r\nEffective crisis management implies the capacity to\r\nreact quickly, which is why it would be desirable to\r\nenhance the United Nations capacity to rapidly carry the\r\nnecessary personnel and equipment to the theatre of\r\noperations. In the recent past there have been too many\r\ninstances in which the Secretary-General has been forced to\r\ndelay operations approved by the Security Council owing\r\nto a lack of personnel or equipment. This implies that we,\r\nthe Member States, should contribute the necessary peace-\r\nkeeping troops for future missions and that we should be in\r\na position to put them rapidly at the disposal of the United\r\nNations. These contributions should not be limited to\r\nmilitary personnel, but should also include civilians, from\r\npolice to election observers. Indeed, peace-keeping requires\r\nmany skills, including that of being able to intervene\r\nbetween opposing parties, of being sensitive to cultural\r\nparticularities, and of being able to act as a mediator. The\r\npersonnel who are called upon to intervene in these\r\ncomplex, difficult and dangerous situations should therefore\r\nbe properly prepared and trained. Uniform training and\r\njoint exercises constitute the key to the effective integration\r\nof different national contingents in a multinational\r\noperation.\r\nFinally, there is a need for a substantial strengthening\r\nof the safety provisions for the Blue Helmets.\r\nDriven to the limits of its financial and organizational\r\ncapacities, the United Nations will increasingly need to\r\ncount on regional organizations and structures in order to\r\ncarry out these peace-keeping operations. Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and such organizations is\r\nprovided for by the Charter, and it has been developed, for\r\nexample, in the former Yugoslavia, in Somalia and in the\r\nCaucasus. It should be further strengthened.\r\nOnly the United Nations has the international\r\nlegitimacy to decide to use force or to impose peace\r\nenforcement measures. But in the sphere of peace-keeping\r\nand preventive diplomacy, the activities of regional\r\norganizations would have the advantage of relieving the\r\nUnited Nations of part of its work. Often having a better\r\nunderstanding of the conflicts in their areas, such\r\norganizations could act with greater effectiveness.\r\nWith respect to the European continent, the United\r\nNations should intensify its cooperation with the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(CSCE), the Council of Europe and the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO), taking into account the\r\ncompetence of each of those organizations.\r\nDoes international law authorize the United Nations\r\nto intervene within a country? Does not the Charter\r\nassert the principle of non-intervention in the internal\r\naffairs of a State?\r\nI welcome the fact that for some time now the\r\ninternational community has been treating that principle\r\nin a more flexible way. That principle should no longer\r\nserve as a shield for flagrant and massive violations of\r\nhuman rights. That is what occurred in 1991 in Iraq,\r\nwhen the international community came to the aid of the\r\nKurds, harshly repressed by Saddam Hussein, or, again in\r\n1992 in Somalia, when the task was to protect the supply\r\nof humanitarian aid to a population threatened by famine.\r\nOn each occasion, the international community\r\ncourageously assumed its duty to assist, though it is true\r\nthat in Somalia a political solution remains to be found.\r\nDid the international community show similar\r\ndetermination when, last spring, a virtual genocide was\r\nperpetrated in Rwanda, especially when the Tutsi\r\ncommunity became the target of a deliberate act of\r\nextermination undertaken by officials of the Hutu\r\ncommunity?\r\nThe United Nations, after hesitating for a moment,\r\ndecided to reconstitute the United Nations Assistance\r\nMission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in order to provide\r\nprotection to the population that was threatened. But the\r\nSecretary-General’s appeal was not heeded. The action\r\nfinally taken by France and the Africans - and for this I\r\npay a tribute to them - succeeded at least in putting the\r\nbrakes on this infernal machine. I hope in any case that\r\nan international tribunal will be created without delay to\r\nbring to trial those responsible for this crime against\r\nhumanity.\r\nIn this era of interdependence, efforts with a view to\r\ncollective maintenance of peace and security cannot be\r\nreduced to peace-keeping operations alone, but must\r\nnecessarily take into account economic and social factors.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nFamine, underdevelopment, the flow of refugees, over-\r\npopulation, environmental deterioration, drug abuse and,\r\nfinally, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are\r\nall serious threats to our global balance and, hence, to\r\nworld peace.\r\nIn the economic sphere, too, our security depends on\r\nthat of others. In all sectors that give rise to concern,\r\nwhether we are dealing with military, trade, environmental\r\nor health problems, no nation can isolate itself from others.\r\nWe are all affected by what happens beyond our borders,\r\njust as our own actions within our borders inevitably have\r\nrepercussions on the community of nations as a whole.\r\nOur security is increasingly indivisible. We cannot\r\ndisregard the links that exist between development,\r\neconomic growth, protection of the environment and\r\npopulation movements. If the situation deteriorates in any\r\none area, the whole can be destabilized.\r\nHaving a global mandate in political, economic and\r\ncultural matters, the United Nations is the ideal forum in\r\nwhich to carry on the quest for lasting development that is\r\ncompatible with preservation of an environmental balance\r\nand with the needs of social development.\r\nWe express our satisfaction at the recent issuance by\r\nthe Secretary-General of his \"Agenda for Development\",\r\nwhich is a supplement to his \"Agenda for Peace\".\r\nWe hope that at this session of the Assembly we will\r\nsucceed in identifying the priority sectors in which we\r\nshould undertake in-depth reforms.\r\nThe promotion of progress and of economic, social\r\nand environmental development needs greater attention if\r\nwe wish to overcome the long-term threats to international\r\nsecurity. We must give our Organization the necessary\r\ntools to strengthen international cooperation, while national\r\nGovernments make efforts to overcome increasingly\r\ncomplex problems relating to development.\r\nOur vision of the future cannot merely accept poverty\r\nand privation in far too many parts of the world, where\r\npopulations are deprived of their fundamental right to food\r\nand education and even to water, health and a roof over\r\ntheir heads. Wishing to make its contribution to a much-\r\nneeded international solidarity, the Government of\r\nLuxembourg has undertaken to double, by the year 2000,\r\nthe percentage of its gross national product earmarked for\r\nofficial development assistance so as to reach the target of\r\n0.7 per cent.\r\nThe agenda for humanity, if I may use the\r\nexpression of our Secretary-General, is the true challenge\r\nfaced by the United Nations at the end of this twentieth\r\ncentury. From Rio to Cairo, through Vienna, Copenhagen\r\nand Beijing, major international conferences are supplying\r\nglobal answers to these global questions. Mankind,\r\nhuman development and commitment to his community\r\nare at the heart of those concerns, whether we speak of\r\nthe Earth Summit, the World Conference on Human\r\nRights, the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, the World Summit for Social Development\r\nor the Fourth World Conference on Women. Improving\r\nthe status of women and of women’s general access to\r\neducation and health is one of the keys to the success of\r\nthis vast undertaking.\r\nMillions of people in many parts of the world\r\ncontinue to fall victim to flagrant violations of their\r\nhuman rights. The Vienna Conference reaffirmed the\r\nuniversal validity of those human rights.\r\nThe creation at the last session of the General\r\nAssembly of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights should encourage\r\ngreater respect for those principles. However,\r\nundertakings assumed are valuable only if they are\r\ntranslated into practical action. Thus, we must ensure that\r\nthe United Nations has the necessary support and means\r\nin this sphere to implement its programme of action. We\r\nmust take the necessary measures to increase the\r\nresources and strengthen the functioning of the United\r\nNations Centre for Human Rights, as well as that of the\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nNon-governmental organizations, through their\r\nactions, are also now a part of the international\r\nconscience, including its conscience in regard to respect\r\nfor human rights. Thus, our Organization and all its\r\nMember States should recognize and facilitate the\r\nimportant role played by those organizations.\r\nAs we draw near to the celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, our Organization has\r\nbeen undertaking a series of negotiations with a view to\r\nrevising its working methods. The work with a view to\r\nthe necessary reform of the Security Council has\r\ncontinued over the past year. It will be necessary to\r\npersevere in our search for a solution that will reconcile\r\nthe need for a more balanced composition with the\r\nconcern for effective functioning.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nIt is also imperative to improve the methods of work\r\nof the Council and ensure greater transparency in its work\r\nand better communication with the members of the General\r\nAssembly. Although the latter do not participate in the\r\ndeliberations of the Council, they are bound by its decisions\r\nand they are regularly requested to apply sanctions and to\r\nprovide funds or personnel for the implementation of peace-\r\nkeeping operations.\r\nThe Secretariat is a key institution of the United\r\nNations system. It must have the necessary means to carry\r\nout the innovative work it has been undertaking\r\nenergetically and courageously. At the same time,\r\nhowever, we should combat the proliferation of institutions,\r\nsince this exhausts the limited resources of our\r\nOrganization and compromises the cogency of its efforts.\r\nIn this period of limited resources, it is also imperative\r\nthat Member States seriously take up the question of\r\neffective management. Strict budgetary discipline is\r\nneeded, and resources should no longer be wasted on\r\noperations with ill-defined goals. In that connection, we\r\nwelcome the various steps taken by the Secretary-General\r\nwith a view to making better use of the resources provided\r\nto the Organization and creating a more rigorous financial\r\ninspection system.\r\nOur Organization, in the end, will succeed only\r\nthrough the way in which each State discharges its own\r\nresponsibilities under the Charter. They include financial\r\nresponsibilities. The obligation of solidarity that is binding\r\nupon all States of our Organization should motivate them\r\nto discharge their budgetary obligations to the United\r\nNations in full and on time.\r\nOur Organization, which is the only forum that brings\r\ntogether virtually all the States of the world, needs the\r\ncommitment of its Members. It needs decisions that are\r\nwell thought out. It needs measures for proper follow-up.\r\nOnly in that way will it be able usefully to contribute to\r\nchannelling international efforts to realize our common\r\ngoal: which is to make our planet a place where peace,\r\nsecurity and greater prosperity for all peoples of the world\r\ncan prevail.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Secretary for External Relations of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia, the Honourable Mr. Resio Moses.\r\nMr. Moses (Federated States of Micronesia): I am\r\nhonoured to address this forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. First, I wish to congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on\r\nhis election to the presidency, and to say that his\r\nexperience makes him an excellent choice to ably lead\r\nthis body to meet the challenges ahead. I also take this\r\nopportunity, on behalf of my Government, to congratulate\r\nthe former President, His Excellency Mr. Samuel\r\nInsanally, and express our appreciation for his\r\ncontributions. The same appreciation is extended to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, for his strong and\r\neffective leadership, so instrumental in the success of the\r\nwork accomplished by this Organization.\r\nWe note with great sympathy the terrible volcanic\r\neruption in Papua New Guinea. We express the hope that\r\nthis Organization and its Members will take all possible\r\nmeasures to assist in alleviating the suffering and\r\ndestruction caused by this disaster. We also express our\r\nsympathy to the people and the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Estonia for the recent accident and loss of\r\nlife in that country.\r\nWe join the other members of this Assembly in\r\nwarmly welcoming the new South Africa here. Their\r\nstruggle was long, arduous and painful. The people and\r\nGovernment of Micronesia share the joy of the\r\nGovernment and people of South Africa at having\r\nachieved their objective.\r\nMy Government welcomes the historic steps taken\r\ntoward peace in the Middle East and expresses its support\r\nfor the ongoing bilateral negotiations between the parties\r\nin that region. In the light of these positive developments\r\nin the peace process, the General Assembly should reflect\r\nthis new reality in the course of this forty-ninth session\r\nand provide an environment conducive to further dialogue\r\nbetween parties.\r\nWe gather at a time in our history when new\r\ngrounds of cooperation are being woven into greater\r\ndimensions of solidarity. This is fortunate because we\r\nalso face urgent challenges to the future of our planet.\r\nFrom the point of view of a small developing State, we\r\ncome to this Assembly with immediate concerns on such\r\nissues as climate change, sustainable development, nuclear\r\nwaste and natural disasters.\r\nLinked with all these concerns is the issue of human\r\nrights. The road from Vienna, where the world\r\ncommunity met only a few hundred miles from where\r\n\"ethnic cleansing\" was taking place in Bosnia and spoke\r\nof improvements in the field of human rights, has been\r\nmarked with new signposts leading us in the right\r\ndirection, namely, the establishment of the post of United\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the\r\nelection of Ambassador Jose Ayala Lasso to that post.\r\nHowever, the scenery along the way is not that much\r\ndifferent from what it was for many years before this.\r\nToday, the atrocities and violations of human rights that are\r\ncontinuing in Bosnia seem to be even overshadowed by\r\nnewer outbreaks of human rights violations in such areas as\r\nRwanda, Haiti and other parts of our world. This\r\nAssembly must continue to devote its attention and\r\nresources to human rights.\r\nSeveral weeks ago at Brisbane, Australia, the Heads of\r\nGovernment of our 15 Pacific States, including the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia, held the annual meeting of\r\nthe South Pacific Forum. As is their practice each year, the\r\nleaders discussed matters of common concern within our\r\nregion and expressed consensus views in a communiqué\r\nthat has already been presented and included in the records\r\nof this Assembly. The Federated States of Micronesia\r\nsubscribes to the views expressed in that communiqué, and\r\nwill be guided by it in many of our actions here in the\r\ncoming months.\r\nThe South Pacific Forum also decided, at its recent\r\nmeeting in Brisbane, to seek observer status at the United\r\nNations during this forty-ninth session. In attaining\r\nobserver status with the United Nations, the South Pacific\r\nForum will address the increasing importance placed on the\r\nrole of regional organizations and the contributions they can\r\nmake towards the objectives of the United Nations. We\r\nbelieve that the Forum, as an observer, can increase the\r\neffectiveness of our region’s work on such critical issues as\r\nclimate change, conservation of biological diversity and\r\neffective implementation of the results of the Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States.\r\nOne long-standing major concern of our Government,\r\nwhich is shared by Forum members, is the testing of\r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction\r\nwithin our region. We are relieved by the continued\r\nmoratorium on nuclear testing by France and the United\r\nStates, but we remain deeply concerned at the possible\r\nconsequences that may flow from China’s insistence on\r\nproceeding with its programme. We will not breathe easy\r\nuntil a moratorium on all testing is made permanent, and to\r\nthat end we hope that rapid progress will be made towards\r\nconcluding a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.\r\nDespite our outspoken concerns in numerous\r\ninternational venues during recent years, the Pacific\r\nregion’s vastness and seeming emptiness still makes it an\r\nattractive location for environmentally unfriendly\r\nactivities. Too often, when we have attempted as island\r\ncountries to halt movements through our waters of toxic,\r\nradioactive and hazardous materials, our voices have not\r\nbeen heard. As if the dangers of such transport were not\r\nbad enough, today we confront an even more repugnant\r\nprospect, that of our region becoming a permanent\r\ndumping ground for the world’s nuclear waste. I wish to\r\nemphasize here that the Federated States of Micronesia is\r\nand will remain diametrically opposed to the use of our\r\nregion by countries which are unwilling to store their\r\nwaste within their own borders. As part of our dedication\r\nto finding more effective means to prevent these outrages,\r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia has the honour of\r\nchairing the ongoing negotiations within the Forum group\r\ntowards a regional treaty banning transboundary\r\nmovement of all hazardous wastes.\r\nThrough these and other appropriate actions, we are\r\ndetermined to see that the Pacific region is treated by the\r\nrest of the world community with the same degree of\r\nconcern for the long-term health and welfare of our\r\npeople and their environment.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s new report on\r\nan Agenda for Development. My Government fully\r\nsupports the call for a re-evaluation of the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in development. As the United Nations\r\napproaches its fiftieth anniversary, its global agenda must\r\nbe redefined to be more comprehensive and more\r\nfocused. The present lack of coordination between the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the United Nations must\r\nbe corrected to synchronize the setting of global policy on\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe end of the cold war has presented the United\r\nNations with a long-overdue opportunity to turn its\r\nattention to development. Yet the cost associated with\r\nexpanded peace-keeping operations around the world is\r\ndiverting scarce resources at a time when, for many\r\nStates, the role of the United Nations in development is\r\nbecomingly increasingly prominent. This is a trend that\r\nthe United Nations must examine very carefully in order\r\nto find the proper balance among all its responsibilities\r\nunder the Charter.\r\nThe recently concluded International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development in Cairo is testimony to the\r\nglobal problems associated with our rapid population\r\ngrowth. The United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity face a pressing urgency to redirect resources\r\nto address population growth and sustainable resource use.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nThe world’s population is growing faster than ever before\r\nwith an estimated number of 95 million people being added\r\neach year. This unprecedented population growth rate will\r\nhave a profound effect on our environment. The action\r\nplan for population and sustainable development has clear\r\nimplications for climate change. I wish to draw the\r\ndistinction that, although the rate of population growth in\r\nthe industrialized world is slower, these countries still add\r\na disproportionate cost to the environment because residents\r\nin industrialized countries add about four times as much\r\ncarbon to the atmosphere each year as do their counterparts\r\nin the developing countries. Micronesia strongly supports\r\nthe Programme of Action on Population Control and\r\nDevelopment endorsed at Cairo and is looking forward to\r\nmeeting the goals and objectives contained therein.\r\nAs an island State, my Government welcomes the\r\nsignificant breakthrough and the universal acceptance of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of Sea and its\r\nimminent entry into force on 16 November 1994. This is\r\nthe culmination of long and arduous negotiations among\r\ncountries for more than a decade in shaping what I consider\r\nto be a near-perfect management and conservation regime\r\nfor the high seas and the deep seabed which is the common\r\nheritage of mankind. The Federated States of Micronesia\r\nis a party to the Convention and I am happy to inform the\r\nAssembly that my country was among the many countries\r\nwhich signed the deep seabed mining Agreement relating to\r\nthe Implementation of Part XI of the Convention after it\r\nwas opened for signature. We look forward to close\r\ncooperation with the international community in the sound\r\nmanagement and conservation of the high seas as well as\r\nour individual territorial waters.\r\nAs a developing island State whose economy is\r\ndependent on these resources, Micronesia is committed to\r\nthe promotion of responsible fishing practices - not only\r\nwithin our exclusive economic zone and the zones of our\r\nneighbours in the region, but also in the contiguous high\r\nseas areas adjacent to the zones. The Federated States of\r\nMicronesia has actively participated in all of the substantive\r\nsessions of the United Nations Conference on Straddling\r\nFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. In the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia, we are fortunate that our\r\nislands are located in those latitudes of the Pacific Ocean in\r\nwhich 50 per cent of the world’s highest grade tuna\r\nresources are located and caught. While we appreciate\r\nhaving this resource, we remain ever mindful of the fact\r\nthat the continued viability of our economy depends on the\r\nrational use of the marine resources present in our waters\r\nand beyond. This principle of rational utilization of\r\nresources forms the foundation for the concept of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nIt is not only coastal States like my own, which must\r\nbe dedicated to rational use and responsible fishing\r\npractices. Distant water fishing nations must also\r\nrecognize and protect the fragile balance of nature that\r\nexists in the oceans of the world to ensure the\r\nsustainability of the resource.\r\nDuring the last session of the Conference on\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks,\r\nmy Government’s delegation joined the 15 other States\r\nmembers of the Forum Fisheries Agency in supporting a\r\nbinding legal document as the form of outcome for the\r\nConference. Even so, we do not support any outcome\r\nwhich would compromise the sovereign rights of coastal\r\nStates over the living marine resources occurring within\r\ntheir own extended economic zones. We do not support\r\nany derogation from the provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea that recognize the\r\nsovereign rights of coastal States.\r\nI now direct my comments to the recently concluded\r\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States in Barbados, which has\r\nbeen a great success in many ways. For the first time in\r\nthe history of the United Nations, we have been able to\r\nput forward an agenda for world attention concerning the\r\nsustainable development of small island developing States.\r\nThe Programme of Action that emerged from that Global\r\nConference is the first post-Rio de Janeiro effort to\r\namplify the principles of Agenda 21 in a specific context\r\npointing towards tangible measures for implementation.\r\nWhile this is a milestone, it will remain little more\r\nthan a planning document without the genuine\r\ncommitment of our developing countries around the\r\nworld. We welcome the recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on actions taken by the Organization and by the\r\nbodies of the United Nations system to implement the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States. We cannot help but feel\r\na certain impatience to see actions taken that are\r\naccompanied by necessary funding; nevertheless my\r\nGovernment applauds the steps being taken to ensure that\r\nthe results of the Barbados Conference are integrated into\r\nthe programme of work of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development. Strong partnership in this\r\nregard should be seen not as a conflict between developed\r\nand developing countries, but rather as a shared goal and\r\nan investment for the benefit of the entire family of\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nnations. A notable and welcome example of such shared\r\neffort is the upcoming initiative by the United States to\r\nwork with all countries towards the revitalization of the\r\nessential coral reefs, which are deteriorating all over the\r\nworld.\r\nThe Global Environmental Facility (GEF) is one\r\nsource of funding from which Small Island Developing\r\nStates could access financial assistance for implementation\r\nof the Programme of Action and other related\r\nenvironmental endeavours. The Programme of Action\r\nadopted at the Barbados Conference specifically requested\r\nthat, since such global environmental problems as climate\r\nchange, biological diversity and international waters are of\r\ngreat significance and concern to small island developing\r\nStates, the restructured GEF should be seen as an important\r\nchannel of assistance in these areas through the provision\r\nof new and additional resources. At the meeting of Heads\r\nof State the South Pacific Forum, which recently concluded\r\nin Brisbane, Australia, welcomed the restructuring and\r\nreplenishment of the GEF and its intention to assist in the\r\nimplementation of the decisions taken at Barbados.\r\nWe therefore encourage all Member States, during the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly, to give\r\nmeaning to the concept of sustainable development by\r\nsupporting the overall outcome of Barbados, including all\r\nenabling legislation. This will give the United Nations\r\nspecialized agencies and organizations the mandate to start\r\nimplementing the Programme of Action.\r\nIn the Framework Convention on Climate Change, we\r\nappealed for a more constructive approach by the\r\ninternational community, with a view to further\r\ncommitments towards the reduction of greenhouse gases, as\r\ncalled for by the proposed protocol to the Convention\r\ndistributed this week to the Parties by the Alliance of Small\r\nIsland States. Recent scientific reports have confirmed with\r\ncertainty that global warming is occurring. More\r\nimportantly, it is also clear that the industrialized countries\r\nmust make greater cutbacks in emissions than were\r\noriginally envisioned if there is to be any hope of avoiding\r\ndisastrous consequences to much of the world -\r\nconsequences which cynics were scoffing at only a few\r\nyears ago. We welcomed with hope the coming into being\r\nof the climate-change Convention this past March and call\r\nupon all Members of the United Nations to be present as\r\nParties when the Conference of the Parties to the\r\nConvention convenes in Berlin.\r\nIn keeping with its concern for the protection and\r\nsustainable use of the environment, the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia acceded in June to the Convention on\r\nBiological Diversity and is looking forward to the first\r\nConference of the Parties this November, in the Bahamas.\r\nIn this connection, my Government wishes to add its\r\nsupport to the request made at the last session of the\r\nIntergovernmental Group in Nairobi that work on a\r\nprotocol on biosafety should begin without further delay.\r\nThe question of ownership and access to ex-situ genetic\r\nresources not presently covered by the Convention must\r\nalso be addressed as a matter of priority.\r\nThe concept of giving equal priority to the\r\nenvironment and to development is now widely accepted\r\nbut remains in many ways difficult to implement. It will\r\nremain so for many years to come, even though all our\r\nbest thinking is to be devoted to it. Sadly, even as we\r\nspeak, the quality and stocks of our planet’s natural\r\nresources are deteriorating at an accelerated pace due to\r\npast and current practices. If we are to succeed in\r\nconfronting this challenge, the integrated efforts of the\r\nentire international community must call upon the assets\r\nthat all countries - large and small, developed and\r\ndeveloping - can bring to bear.\r\nFor example, sustainable living, which has been the\r\nway of island peoples for centuries, involves practices and\r\ntechniques that are quite relevant to sustainable\r\ndevelopment in much of today’s world. The canoes\r\nsailing across our crystal blue lagoons bring to mind a\r\nhost of traditions of our people that involve clean use of\r\nthe environment and highly effective resource-\r\nmanagement practices. We must approach sustainable\r\ndevelopment in a way that respects and builds on the age-\r\nold concept of sustainable living and takes full account of\r\nthe wisdom that can be gleaned from indigenous cultures\r\nworldwide.\r\nIn other words, my country believes that not only is\r\nit important to have a common vision to combat climate\r\nchange and promote sustainable development, but it is\r\nnow incumbent upon us seriously to rethink our roles and\r\nhow we can all play a vital part in restoring our\r\nenvironment. As a front-line country in terms of\r\nvulnerability, Micronesia recognizes that we cannot retreat\r\ninto the position of treating global environmental issues\r\nonly to the extent to which we think we are conveniently\r\ncapable, without giving due consideration to their urgency\r\nand magnitude. Addressing this man-made catastrophe\r\nrequires many more additional resources and a greater\r\ncommitment, especially on the part of the developed\r\nworld.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nOur views on these issues are clear and simple: we\r\nare convinced that all our efforts are mounting up to a\r\nlong-term investment for the survival and viability of our\r\necosystem, the common heritage of mankind. In assessing\r\nwhat has transpired so far in all related activities geared to\r\nthis common objective, I cannot but say how fascinated I\r\nam with the enormous effort that has gone into these\r\nprocesses. The activities include the negotiations on the\r\nclimate-change Convention, the biodiversity Convention, the\r\ndesertification Convention and the Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea, as well as the Conference on Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the Barbados\r\nConference, the Cairo Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, the Commission on Sustainable Development\r\nand the Global Environmental Facility. I cannot but believe\r\nthat positive progress will emanate from this massive\r\nhuman energy and commitment, and that our future will be\r\nsecured with this common vision. We are not only\r\ninhabitants of this planet, but custodians of its resources for\r\nfuture generations. I hope that the greed of mankind will\r\nnot in the end triumph over the our inherent responsibility\r\nto leave for future generations an environment that is as\r\nhabitable as the one we find today. Sustainable utilization\r\nof our natural resources may be the greatest gift that our\r\npresent civilization can contribute to future humanity.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kyrgyzstan, Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Rosa E. Otunbayeva.\r\nMrs. Otunbayeva (Kyrgyzstan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): I wish to congratulate the President on his\r\nappointment to this highly responsible and important post.\r\nMy delegation will work constructively with him during the\r\ncourse of this, the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations.\r\nSince the end of the Second World War, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of which we shall be celebrating next year, the\r\nworld has been engaged in peace-building. It has been a\r\nlong road, and it has not been without its dramatic\r\nmoments. Over the past half century the world has come\r\nto the brink of nuclear war many times. Now, with the end\r\nof the cold war, with the dissolution of the bipolar world,\r\na new challenge has arisen in the shape of a series of wars\r\nand conflicts based on ethnic and religious intolerance that\r\nhave exploded in many different areas of the world.\r\nIn his report \"An Agenda for Peace\" the Secretary\r\nGeneral spoke of the concentration of efforts towards\r\npreventive diplomacy, of steps for increasing international\r\nconfidence-building and achieving early recognition of\r\nconflict situations. Such measures have taken on special\r\nimportance in our countries with the fall of\r\ntotalitarianism, because we have inherited many long-\r\nstanding issues of conflict that had previously been\r\nhidden and suppressed by a regime of terror in the\r\nconditions of that time.\r\nThe United Nations, in our view, could play a\r\nleadership role in the study of typical conflict situations.\r\nIt could systematize the approaches, principles and paths\r\nfor the resolution of traditional issues of dispute such as\r\nborder issues, the sharing or allocation of water and other\r\nnatural resources, the self-determination of nations and\r\nterritorial integrity, and the protection of minorities on the\r\nbasis of ethnic, religious, linguistic and other differences.\r\nThis would allow the United Nations to establish a legal\r\nbasis for decisions that would help decrease the potential\r\nfor new conflicts and aid in the resolution of existing\r\nproblems. Only by following the highest authority of\r\nlaw, and only on the basis of international law, can we\r\nweave a solid fabric of peace throughout the planet, in all\r\nof its smallest corners, no matter how remote or\r\nprovincial.\r\nViolence and intolerance among people have led to\r\nunending war and bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe tragedy of Bosnia poses a challenge to all\r\nhumankind. Fifty years ago the nations of this world,\r\nhaving united, put an end to nazism and genocide. Why\r\nthen are we now moving so slowly in the face of the\r\nviolence that is obviously based on ethnic and religious\r\ndiscrimination and that is reverberating throughout the\r\nplanet? We stand for a political settlement of conflicts.\r\nWe call for both sides to put an end to the bloody\r\nslaughter. In our view, the recommendations of the\r\nContact Group provide a way out of this crisis and hope\r\nthat peace can be restored in the heart of Europe.\r\nWe greatly value the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, his Mission and the Observer Group of the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(CSCE) to resolve issues peacefully in Tajikistan. We\r\nwelcome the recently signed cease-fire in Tehran, in\r\naccordance with which hostilities have temporarily ceased\r\nand political prisoners and prisoners of war are being\r\nreleased. We have great hope for the gradual end of this\r\ncrisis and for the unification of the Tajik peoples, who\r\nhave experienced more than enough sorrow and suffering,\r\nfor the return of all refugees to their homes and for the\r\nrestoration of peace with our neighbours. We express this\r\nhope now, before the coming winter, and call upon all\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\ncountries to render vitally important humanitarian aid to\r\nTajikistan.\r\nWe are following with great concern and alarm the\r\nsituation in Afghanistan and welcome the efforts towards\r\nsettlement. The restoration of peace in that country and the\r\nachievement of national reconciliation would bring long-\r\nawaited peace to the Afghan people, who have suffered so\r\nmuch, and drastically improve the situation in our region of\r\nthe world. That region is exhausted from gunfire and war.\r\nIt is yearning for trade and a return to tilling the soil.\r\nNotwithstanding the tremendous difficulties inherent\r\nin our search for peace and accord in that country, we urge\r\nthe world not to give in either to moral or to donor fatigue.\r\nIt is not possible to dodge responsibilities during this trying\r\nperiod because the deadly conflict in this country has been\r\nbrought about by participation on many different sides.\r\nAfghanistan has a plethora of weapons. The country is\r\nprey to a non-stop and intensive arms race. Hope for peace\r\ncan be guaranteed only if the international community\r\ndevotes its unwavering attention and political will to\r\nunravelling the knot of the Afghan conflict.\r\nThat is why my country has consistently called for\r\ncompletion and effective implementation of the Register of\r\nConventional Weapons. We support the initiative of the\r\nUnited States announced by President Clinton on the\r\nratification of and support for General Assembly resolution\r\n48/75 K of 16 December 1993 on a moratorium on the\r\nexport of land-mines.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic has consistently stood for a\r\ncomprehensive, effective reduction in conventional arms.\r\nWe are actively and diligently working on the conversion\r\nof our defence industry to civilian production. Kyrgyzstan,\r\nas a non-nuclear State, signed the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and advocates\r\ntransforming it into an agreement of unlimited duration.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of all countries - and first and\r\nforemost the United States of America and France - to\r\nreach a consensus on the issue of a comprehensive nuclear-\r\ntest ban.\r\nWe support the initiatives put forward by President\r\nNazarbayev of Kazakhstan on confidence-building measures\r\nin Asia, and we envisage our region of Central Asia,\r\nlocated as it is between two nuclear Powers, as an area free\r\nof nuclear weapons. That would be our Central Asian\r\ntreaty.\r\nOur world, so full of anxiety and so weary, believes\r\nthat hope for peace is not an illusion. I recall with great\r\nexcitement the unseasonably warm day of 13 September\r\n1993 at the White House in Washington when, after many\r\nyears of conflict, a declaration of principles on Palestinian\r\nself-rule in Gaza and Jericho was signed by the Israeli\r\nGovernment and the Palestine Liberation Organization.\r\nIt is with great satisfaction and happiness that we see\r\ntogether with us in this Hall representatives of the\r\nGovernment of South Africa that was elected on a\r\ndemocratic basis. Let us stock up on patience. We can\r\nachieve breakthroughs and visible results on the difficult\r\npath to peace and concord only if we do not give in to\r\nfatalism.\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts are achieving\r\nsignificant success in settling many of the conflicts of our\r\ntime. We know that 75 countries are participating in 17\r\nUnited Nations Missions overseeing the holding and\r\nmonitoring of elections, rendering humanitarian assistance\r\nduring disasters and restoring what has been destroyed, as\r\nwell as ensuring a United Nations military and police\r\npresence. The issue of creating reserve peace-keeping\r\nforces has now been raised. From this rostrum we hear\r\nthe commitment of dozens of countries to peace-keeping\r\noperations. We need the blue helmets of peace, not the\r\nmercenary black helmets of death which have recently\r\nparticipated with increasing frequency in conflict zones\r\naround the world.\r\nFully aware that peace-keeping operations are an\r\nimportant factor in the future new world order, my\r\ncountry, with its highly qualified doctors, nurses,\r\nengineers and rescue workers, would like to participate in\r\npeace-keeping operations. We accept and support the\r\nproposals that many countries have made here at the\r\nGeneral Assembly during discussions of peace-keeping\r\nissues with regard to the need and opportunities for\r\nconducting training of military and civilian personnel on\r\nboth a multilateral and a bilateral basis. Such possibilities\r\nare also open to us as participants in the Partnership for\r\nPeace programme of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO).\r\nAs a country experiencing a period of emergency\r\nand in need of immediate assistance because of natural\r\ndisasters and social hardships, we warmly support the\r\nproposal of Argentina’s President Menem that a civilian\r\nservice be created to provide immediate humanitarian\r\nassistance under the auspices of the United Nations.\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nDevelopment is the main problem facing young\r\ndemocratic societies. Thirty years’ experience of North-\r\nSouth collaboration has taught us, the new 1990s generation\r\nof independent countries, instructive lessons. It is easy for\r\nour achievements and our real advantages to become lost in\r\nthe picture of the protracted drop in production levels and\r\nthe destruction of the social infrastructure. The people of\r\nKyrgyzstan are grateful to the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the World Health Organization\r\n(WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) and other institutions in the\r\nUnited Nations family that have sought to help us at this\r\ndifficult time.\r\nIn the face of a sharp increase in drug trafficking,\r\ninterwoven with transnational organized crime, first in our\r\nregion and then through Russia to Europe and other\r\ncontinents, we need energetic and massive measures to\r\nblock the drug-distribution routes and destroy production.\r\nThe United Nations International Drug Control Programme\r\nhas become truly critical in our region. As a whole, we\r\nwould like to see greater action and coordination of the\r\nwork of the United Nations specialized institutions with the\r\nnew States, both at their headquarters and in their regional\r\noffices.\r\nIt is noteworthy that not only traditional developed\r\ncountries, but also developing countries, which bear the\r\nburden of their own numerous economic and social\r\nproblems, have helped in the establishment of the newly\r\nindependent States and their entry into the world order.\r\nAnd this has particular significance. We are firmly\r\nconvinced that the timely rendering of full-fledged,\r\neffective assistance to us - countries with transitional\r\neconomies that must now choose their own paths at this\r\ndifficult time - will help us to stand more quickly on our\r\nown two feet, form the foundation for a market economy\r\nand develop democratic foundations for society. We\r\nourselves will then be able to render speedier assistance to\r\nthe more needy. We support such a policy of reaching out\r\ntowards solidarity, mutual support and collaboration.\r\nBearing in mind the close collaboration of countries\r\nwith transitional economies with international financial and\r\neconomic institutions, precise coordination and deeper\r\ninteraction of the work of the United Nations and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions are becoming increasingly\r\nnecessary.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic welcomes and shares the\r\nobjectives and fundamental parameters of development set\r\nforth in the preliminary report of the Secretary-General,\r\n\"An Agenda for Development\". These are peace,\r\neconomic growth, the environment, justice and\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThe recent World Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment in Cairo and future Conferences on social\r\ndevelopment and the improvement of the status of women\r\ntestify to the world’s deep concern about the situation of\r\nbasic human needs at the turn of the next century. If\r\nhuman rights are all-inclusive, universal and inalienable,\r\nthen these rights also pertain to all women and children\r\non Earth. The improvement of the status of women is\r\nkey to resolving vital social problems such as those\r\ninvolving population, education and health care. In other\r\nwords, it is the most important issue on the eve of the\r\ntwenty-first century for an agenda for humanity.\r\nIn my country, we will fully support and are ready\r\nto cooperate with the newly appointed United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. We in\r\nKyrgyzstan, a country in which over 80 ethnicities reside,\r\nseek to create equal and just conditions for all of our\r\ncitizens. There are no restrictions on the development of\r\nculture, the arts, education or media in the languages of\r\nall ethnic groups. Along with an increase in mosques, the\r\nnumber of Orthodox and Protestant churches is growing.\r\nCommitted to ideas of friendship and concord, we are\r\nconsistently working on programmes and measures to halt\r\nmigration from our country and to preserve the present\r\nmulti-ethnic composition of society. On the basis of the\r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to\r\nNational or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities\r\nadopted at the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly, my country, together with the Russian\r\nFederation, cosponsored a CIS convention on the rights of\r\nethnic minorities, which is currently open for ratification\r\nto all other Commonwealth members.\r\nDemocracy in my country is very fragile. Political\r\npluralism, freedom of the press and speech, and adherence\r\nto human rights and fundamental freedoms in the\r\nRepublic are not accidental gifts from above but genuine\r\nvalues for which a real struggle is being waged in society\r\n- the struggle between openness and isolation, blind force\r\nand respect for the law, totalitarian ways and commitment\r\nto freedom. But the people of Kyrgyzstan, headed by\r\nPresident Askar Akaev, having made its choice three\r\nyears ago, firmly and unwaveringly stand for democracy\r\nand a market economy.\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nA tectonic political, social, and economic shift is\r\ntaking place across the enormous Eurasian land mass. The\r\nsuccess of the present transformations in Russia strengthens\r\nour own awareness of the irrevocability of the choice of the\r\ndemocratic way. Kyrgyzstan, like other nations of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, is deeply committed\r\nto democracy, the principles of freedom and independence,\r\nand the philosophy and spirit of the creation of peace. My\r\nancient people, yet still a young nation, like the \"Manas\" -\r\na Kyrgyz epic poem of a million lines - the millennium of\r\nwhich we will celebrate in 1995, is undergoing a\r\nrenaissance. We realize that a long and thorny path awaits\r\nus. But the most important thing on that path is peace,\r\nwhich is the same for everyone on this Earth and is\r\nindivisible.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate for this\r\nafternoon.\r\nSeveral representatives have asked to speak in exercise\r\nof the right of reply; I would remind members that, in\r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 34/401,\r\nstatements made in exercise of the right of reply should be\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and five\r\nminutes for the second, and should be made by delegations\r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Matešić (Croatia): I apologize for speaking at\r\nthis late hour, but I shall be brief.\r\nMy delegation wishes to respond to the statement\r\nmade by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece during\r\nthe general debate on Wednesday, 28 September. In\r\nparticular, we wish to respond to the following comment in\r\nhis statement:\r\n\"The concentration of efforts aimed at ending the war\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina does not mean that less\r\nattention should be paid to a solution of the problem\r\nof the Krajinas, nor that its importance should be\r\nunderestimated.\" (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-eighth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n8th meeting, p. 24)\r\nWhile my delegation agrees with the general thrust of\r\nthe Foreign Minister’s comment, we are surprised by his\r\nreference to the so-called Krajinas. From the context, it is\r\nobvious that the reference is to a part of the internationally\r\nrecognized territory of the Republic of Croatia. In this\r\nregard, my delegation wishes to stress that, within the\r\nRepublic of Croatia, there are no administrative units called\r\n\"Krajinas\". Rather, this is a name that has been given by\r\nthe Belgrade proxies to Serb-occupied territories of\r\nCroatia.\r\nWe wish to stress that the Security Council has\r\nstated in numerous resolutions that this territory is an\r\nintegral part of the Republic of Croatia. My delegation\r\nwas therefore surprised by the fact that a part of the\r\nterritory of the Republic of Croatia was referred to in the\r\nmanner mentioned above by the Greek Foreign Minister\r\nwhile, at the same time, he did not make reference to the\r\nRepublic of Croatia when discussing the situation within\r\nCroatia. My delegation was all the more surprised by this\r\nas Greece has shown particular sensitivity to geographic\r\nand State names which it perceives as threatening its\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia wishes to maintain the\r\nexisting good relations that it has with Greece and\r\napplauds any constructive actions of the Greek\r\nGovernment that could help to resolve the crisis in our\r\nregion in a just and equitable manner. However, it would\r\nseem only proper that Greece show consistency in its\r\nposition on geographic names and not make references to\r\nparts of the internationally recognized territory of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia in a manner that is not acceptable to\r\nthe Croatian Government and which might be interpreted\r\nas putting into question the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of the Republic of Croatia.\r\nMr. Laclaustra (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Head of my delegation, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Spain, will have the opportunity\r\ntomorrow to congratulate the President of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nOn this occasion, the Spanish delegation wishes to\r\nrefer to the references made to the Spanish cities of Ceuta\r\nand Melilla in the statement made today by the Prime\r\nMinister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation\r\nof Morocco.\r\nIn my delegation’s view, those references are\r\ninaccurate and inappropriate. They are inaccurate because\r\nthese are Spanish Territories whose citizens are\r\nrepresented in the national parliament under the same\r\nconditions as all their compatriots. The references are\r\ninappropriate because they are not consistent with the\r\ngood relations that exist between the Kingdom of Spain\r\nand the Kingdom of Morocco.\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 29 September 1994\r\nMr. Kulla (Albania) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe head of the Albanian delegation to the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session - the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Mr. Serreqi - in his statement to the\r\nAssembly, will convey the delegation’s congratulations to\r\nMr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire on his election as\r\nPresident of the Assembly for the session. For my part, I\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to wish Mr. Essy all\r\nsuccess in his noble mission.\r\nI requested this opportunity to speak so that I might\r\npresent my Government’s views on statements made here\r\nyesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece.\r\nRegrettably, those statements do not reflect the truth and\r\nthe reality of the situation in my country. We deplore the\r\nfact that for a long time Greece, our neighbour, has\r\ndoggedly refused to recognize the obvious political,\r\neconomic and institutional transformations that have been\r\ncarried out over the past three years by Albania’s\r\ndemocratic Government. I refer in particular to the\r\nabsurd analogy with the previous regime - an analogy that\r\ncontrasts totally with all the reports of numerous\r\ninternational observers.\r\nI should like to recall the fact that my Government\r\nhas committed itself to the best possible treatment of\r\nnational minorities in the Balkans. Respect for the human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms of all the citizens of\r\nAlbania is the foundation of the country’s legislation.\r\nWhat is even more important is that it is one of Albania’s\r\nlong-standing traditions.\r\nAlbania has committed itself to intensive economic\r\nreform and is confronting great difficulties. Several\r\ninternational institutions that are cooperating with us are\r\ncompletely satisfied with our economic reform, describing\r\nit as the most successful. In this context, we note with\r\nregret that Greece, although it is the only Balkan country\r\nin the European Union, has on several occasions used its\r\nveto to block the provision of Union aid to Albania, in an\r\neffort to make our transition even more arduous.\r\nI should like to emphasize that, despite the rigid\r\nposition adopted by Greece, the Government of Albania\r\nhas left the door to dialogue open, considering this the\r\nonly means of overcoming the crisis.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.35 p.m.\r\n35\r\n"
