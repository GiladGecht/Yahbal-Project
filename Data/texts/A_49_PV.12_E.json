(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order a 10.25 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, President\r\nof the Republic of Lithuania\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Lithuania.\r\nMr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, President of the\r\nRepublic of Lithuania, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Lithuania, His Excellency Mr. Algirdas\r\nMykolas Brazauskas, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Brazauskas (spoke in Lithuanian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): I sincerely thank you,\r\nSir, for the honour and opportunity of addressing this\r\nforum, and I extend my congratulations to you upon your\r\nelection to lead the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn this Hall, we see representatives of the entire world,\r\na world in which there has been unprecedented global\r\nchange. Our planet is growing more unified in all areas of\r\nlife; economic and political integration is well under way.\r\nNations, States and entire continents are drawing closer\r\ntogether. It is unfortunate that not all changes lead to\r\nprogress. A new avalanche of problems confronts the\r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations,\r\naffecting rich and poor countries alike.\r\nI fully concur with Secretary-General Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali in his belief that today as never before our\r\ninternational community needs a new and forward-looking\r\nvision of our future. The time has long been ripe for us\r\nto discuss within the United Nations agenda the creation\r\nof a new and universal concept of development that\r\nwould embrace peace, economic development, a clean\r\nenvironment, social justice and democratic governance as\r\nthe five spokes supporting the wheel of humanity’s\r\nprogress. It is clear, I believe, that our generation must\r\ntake up the task of rediscovering the world and building\r\nwithin it new, mutually supportive relationships. One of\r\nthe fundamental instruments at our disposal in this global\r\ntask is the United Nations.\r\nOn the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations, it is appropriate to\r\nrecall the circumstances of its creation. It is important\r\nthat we examine the strengths and weaknesses of the\r\nUnited Nations predecessor, the League of Nations. We\r\nmust learn from this analysis so as to ensure that the\r\nUnited Nations shall not become a mere bystander to\r\nworld events. It is true, of course, that the global\r\nsituation today is fundamentally different from that which\r\nexisted at the outbreak of the Second World War. We no\r\nlonger suffer from the presence of dictatorial bandit States\r\nled by fanatics. But potential dangers exist today; they\r\nare multifaceted and have spread throughout the world.\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nTogether we must overcome racism, hatred of\r\nforeigners, fanatical nationalism and intolerance. If we do\r\nnot, these demons, once having manifested themselves in\r\nmen, communities or entire nations, could destroy the entire\r\nworld.\r\nToday I would like to take note of a historic day for\r\nLithuania, the Baltic States and all of Europe. It is all the\r\nmore significant in that the General Assembly will discuss\r\nat this forty-ninth session, the complete withdrawal of\r\nforeign military forces from the territories of the Baltic\r\nStates, as called for by a General Assembly resolution\r\nadopted at the forty-eighth session. On 31 August 1993 the\r\nwithdrawal of the Russian military from Lithuania was\r\ncompleted, and exactly one year later the same historic\r\nevent took place in Estonia and Latvia. That date also\r\ncoincided with the withdrawal of Russian troops from\r\nGermany. This harmony of dates is more than merely\r\nsymbolic: it marks the resolution of one more consequence\r\nof the Second World War.\r\nGuided by the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter, Lithuania continues to broaden its international\r\nrelations in a consistent manner. The goals and priorities\r\nof our economic, social and foreign policies remain\r\nunchanged.\r\nLithuania seeks to secure democratic government and\r\nthe principles of a free market, and at the same time to\r\nensure the well-being of its people and the protection of\r\nminority rights. Lithuania is confronted with serious\r\nproblems of a social character common to all young\r\ndemocracies.\r\nYet at the same time, we must also recognize what has\r\nalready been accomplished. Lithuania has a stable\r\ncurrency. Inflation is under control. The private sector\r\nalready employs the majority of the work force. A vibrant\r\nand innovative market continues to grow. After four years\r\nof dramatic decline, the standard of living has been\r\nstabilized, although it is still rather low. An attractive legal\r\nenvironment has been ensured for foreign investment.\r\nWe attach great value to the bilateral and multilateral\r\nassistance to the process of democracy-building and free-\r\nmarket reforms. Western interest in and attention to the\r\nrestored democracies of Central Europe is vital not only for\r\nus, the recipients of such assistance, but for the future of a\r\nunified Europe. Today the future of the West can no\r\nlonger be considered in isolation from developments in the\r\nEast.\r\nWe benefit from successful cooperation with Estonia\r\nand Latvia, our closest neighbours, with whom we share\r\na common history and common fate. This year a\r\npermanent body, the Baltic Council of Ministers, was\r\nestablished. But as we look to the future, this will not be\r\nenough. If the Baltic countries are to become integrated\r\nmembers of Europe, then the establishment of a common\r\nvisa and economic space can only be the first step of\r\nmany. It is imperative that our foreign and defence\r\npolicies be even more closely coordinated and that we\r\nharmonize our legislation in accordance with the norms of\r\nthe European Union.\r\nI believe that all the countries of our region face\r\nnew opportunities with the establishment of another\r\ncooperative body approximately one year ago: the\r\nCouncil of Baltic Sea States. This region has great\r\npotential. It is home to countries large and small,\r\neconomically strong and less developed, that not so long\r\nago were separated by the front lines of the cold war.\r\nThe Baltic Sea States are unified by many common\r\ngoals as well as problems. Sadly, in recent days we have\r\nalso shared a common tragedy. I wish to express my\r\ndeepest condolences to the Governments of our\r\nneighbouring countries and to the people whose loved\r\nones perished in the catastrophe that befell the ferry M.S.\r\nEstonia.\r\nAs I speak of our neighbours, I must also point to\r\nour relations with Belarus. We are heartened by the new\r\npossibilities of concluding a treaty on inter-State relations\r\nbetween our two countries. The signing of such a treaty\r\nwill further secure the principle so valued by our nations:\r\ngood-neighbourly relations.\r\nLithuania attaches particular importance to its\r\nrelations with Russia. As neighbours, we are very\r\ninterested - perhaps even more so than other countries -\r\nin the success of the democratic and free-market reforms\r\nin that country.\r\nRussian relations with Lithuania and the other Baltic\r\nStates today are a reflection of the current Russian\r\nposition concerning the evolving European order, one in\r\nwhich old divisions are disappearing. We would like to\r\nhope that the new Russia will adhere to the principles of\r\ninternational law and will not obstruct the integration of\r\nthe Baltic countries into European political, economic and\r\nsecurity structures. This would be a clear signal that the\r\ndemocratic reforms undertaken in Russia are irreversible\r\nand that new lines of division will not be drawn in\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nEurope. It would reaffirm that Russia does not seek to\r\nisolate itself from the West and that, on the contrary, it\r\ntrusts the West and seeks cooperation with it on an equal\r\nbasis.\r\nGiven Lithuania’s geopolitical situation and our\r\neconomic opportunities, we can and are prepared to be a\r\nbridge between East and West. But I also want to\r\nemphasize that a future as a buffer State is completely\r\nunacceptable to us.\r\nSeveral days ago, in his address to the Assembly,\r\nRussian President Yeltsin stated that it was essential to\r\nreject the imposition of one’s will on weaker States and to\r\nbuild a new order, founded on law and morality. I express\r\nmy hope that democratic Russia will adhere to these\r\nresponsibilities and thus justify the growing trust of the\r\ninternational community in its future.\r\nOne year ago I said from this podium that Lithuania\r\nwould welcome steps toward the gradual demilitarization of\r\nthe Kaliningrad district. Today I can state with satisfaction\r\nthat Russia is reducing its military presence in that area.\r\nLithuania, whose territory is traversed by transit to this\r\nRussian enclave, is not indifferent to the future of the\r\nKaliningrad district and the Lithuanian minority residing\r\nthere. Occupying a unique place on the map of Europe, this\r\nRussian territory demands special attention. It could\r\nbecome a stone in the foundation of security and an\r\nattractive economic partner or, under less favourable\r\nconditions, a source or even exporter of military threat and\r\nunrest. Lithuania proposes to examine issues pertaining to\r\nthe Kaliningrad district as part of the round-table\r\nmechanism established by the European Stability Pact. We\r\nhope that all interested parties will give their support to this\r\ninitiative.\r\nIn concluding a fundamental bilateral Treaty with\r\nPoland this year, we have closed a chapter of our common\r\nhistory. From the start of the 1930s and the outbreak of\r\nconflict over Lithuania’s capital of Vilnius, relations\r\nbetween us were tainted by open confrontation, a state of\r\naffairs still remembered in the halls of the Palais des\r\nNations in Geneva. I believe that this Treaty, which\r\nrecognizes and confirms the present borders of our\r\ncountries, can be considered the final rapprochement for\r\nLithuania and Poland. As we greet the future, Lithuanians\r\nand Poles will be able to make their rightful contribution to\r\na unifying Europe.\r\nWe also strive to establish closer ties with other\r\ncountries of Central Europe. We share not only a similar\r\nhistory, but also current problems and future goals. I am\r\nconvinced that the convening of a meeting of the leaders\r\nof all Central European States in the very near future\r\nwould benefit our countries. Such a conference would\r\nallow us to discuss our common reform experiences and\r\nour strategies for drawing closer to the European Union.\r\nParticipation in multilateral and international forums\r\nprovides new opportunities for Lithuania. An ever-\r\nincreasing number of important political decisions are\r\ntoday being reached in international organizations. This\r\nis especially beneficial for small and medium-sized States.\r\nLithuania sees the guarantee of its security, stability\r\nand well-being in joining European political, economic\r\nand security structures. Lithuania has always been an\r\nintegral part of European civilization and culture. We\r\nhave never lost our European heritage. Our recent 50year\r\nseparation from the world did not sever our roots. Our\r\ngoal remains membership in the European Union. We\r\nhave already concluded a free-trade agreement with the\r\nUnion that should come into affect next year. We also\r\nexpect soon to sign an agreement on associate\r\nmembership with the Union.\r\nIntegration into the European Union cannot be\r\nconsidered in isolation from the broadening of\r\nqualitatively new ties with the Western European Union.\r\nLithuania is an associate partner of this defence\r\norganization of ever-increasing importance. We believe\r\nthe strengthening of the role of the Western European\r\nUnion to be both logical and necessary.\r\nI am also convinced that the security and stability of\r\nmy country and the region demand closer cooperation\r\nwith the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\r\nLithuania has presented its formal request for membership\r\nin that organization and will continue resolutely to seek\r\nthe fulfilment of this goal. Lithuania’s participation in the\r\nPartnership for Peace programme opens new avenues for\r\nLithuanian cooperation in efforts with Europe, the United\r\nStates and Canada in their endeavours to prevent conflict\r\nand maintain peace. We firmly hope that our active\r\nparticipation and that of other Central European States in\r\nthe Partnership programme will have a positive impact on\r\nthe broadening of NATO.\r\nThe expansion of NATO eastward would not pose a\r\ndanger or threaten any European State. Russian fears of\r\nisolation, I believe, are groundless. We welcome Russia’s\r\njoining in the Partnership for Peace and hope that its\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nparticipation in the programme will contribute to the\r\nstrengthening of mutual trust and stability.\r\nI should like to take note of several concerns of a\r\nmore global character, the burden and urgency of which are\r\nparticularly felt by the countries in transition. Our\r\nwell-founded fears are heightened by the continuously\r\ngrowing gap between the developed and developing\r\ncountries. Can we truly speak of a stable Europe when the\r\nhourly wages of a laborer in the European Union are equal\r\nto one day’s pay in Central Europe and, in some countries\r\nof Eastern Europe, to a month’s income? If this\r\nunfortunate tendency is allowed to continue, a wave of\r\ndespondency and instability may overflow all barriers.\r\nThe young democracies of Central and Eastern Europe\r\nare confronted by dangers posed by organized crime, illegal\r\nmigration and trafficking in narcotics and, most horribly, in\r\nnuclear materials. These are the unfortunate negative\r\nconsequences of our rejoining the world; without the\r\nnecessary experience, they are difficult to address. We\r\nrequire coordinated and concrete assistance.\r\nWe live not only in a time of great changes, but also\r\nin a world of great contrasts. As we celebrate the historic\r\ntransformation of Europe, the stunning successes in the\r\nMiddle East peace process and the end of apartheid in\r\nSouth Africa, we are nevertheless witnessing continuing\r\ntragedies and conflicts all over the world.\r\nThe efforts of the international community, expressed\r\nthrough the United Nations, do not always achieve their\r\ndesired results. The main reason for this is the inability to\r\nenact decisive measures. This is particularly evident when\r\nlarge countries are for any reason drawn into local conflicts,\r\nleading to a clash of their global interests. In such cases,\r\nthe timely removal of built-up tensions becomes difficult.\r\nIf we fail to avoid conflict, its containment and reduction\r\nbecome painful and long-term, often leading to the death of\r\nBlue Helmets in the execution of their peace mission. It is\r\ntherefore crucial that we join forces to improve the conflict\r\nprevention mechanism. In this regard, we support the\r\ninitiative of Germany and the Netherlands to improve\r\ncooperative relations between the United Nations and the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\r\nEvery State must contribute in a tangible way towards\r\nthe creation of a peaceful and stable world. This must be\r\nthe responsibility of everyone. It would be inappropriate\r\nfor any country to seek to achieve its own interests or\r\nexpand its sphere of influence under the guise of\r\npeace-keeping missions. There are criteria which must be\r\nfollowed in this regard - namely, the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE. These principles must, in\r\nmy opinion, apply to all countries, including the Russian\r\nFederation. We cannot agree to allowing countries to\r\ncarry out peace-keeping missions in any given\r\ngeographical space without the consent of the parties to\r\nthe conflict or the proper international mandate. I would\r\nlike to emphasize my conviction that the principles of\r\ninternational law must be adhered to by all States, small\r\nand large.\r\nWith the end of the cold war and the spread of\r\ndemocracy, old global divisions begin to disappear. It is\r\nvital that this continue. Those who believe that a new\r\ndelineation of spheres of interest can bring stability to the\r\nworld are mistaken. We who have felt the consequences\r\nof such divisions of influence can testify that this would\r\nonly bring about new conflicts and upheaval.\r\nThe United Nations has a particular significance for\r\nsmall and medium-sized States - in other words, the\r\nmajority of countries. These States suffer first when\r\ninstability and mutual distrust take root in the world. In\r\nan anarchic world, guided only by an ad hoc order, small\r\nStates are the first to fall victim to larger interests. Small\r\nStates experience with considerable pain the negative\r\nside-effects of global changes; they are the true front-line\r\nStates. We have only to look at the front pages of the\r\nworld’s newspapers. Bosnia, Rwanda, Tajikistan - all of\r\nthese are small States struggling with tragic historical\r\nlegacies.\r\nAt the same time, if there exist guarantees for their\r\nsecurity, small States develop rapidly and bring their own\r\ncontributions to the international community. I firmly\r\nadhere to my remarks, made a year ago in this Hall, that\r\n\"the future of a more integrated world lies in\r\ndemocracy and the individuality of free nations.\"\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-\r\neighth Session, Plenary Meetings, 7th meeting,\r\np. 14)\r\nThis individuality and diversity do not have to divide us.\r\nQuite the opposite - they will enrich us.\r\nLithuania became a Member of the United Nations\r\nthree years ago. Until now, Lithuania was perhaps a\r\npassive recipient of the assistance and security this\r\nmembership provided. Today Lithuania seeks to\r\ncontribute actively to the undertakings of the international\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\ncommunity to strengthen security and stability throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nTogether with Estonia and Latvia, Lithuania is in the\r\nprocess of establishing a Baltic peace-keeping battalion\r\nwhich will be fully operational in the very near future.\r\nWith the consent of the Lithuanian Parliament, a group of\r\nLithuanian peace-keepers, serving within a larger Danish\r\nbattalion, is today a part of the United Nations Protection\r\nForce stationed in Croatia. I take this opportunity to thank\r\nDenmark and the other countries that provide continuous\r\nassistance in the creation of Lithuanian and Baltic\r\npeace-keeping units. In the future, within its financial\r\ncapabilities, Lithuania will continue to participate in similar\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping and humanitarian missions.\r\nWith the expansion of United Nations membership, the\r\nrange of issues we are asked to discuss within the United\r\nNations has also increased, imposing new responsibilities\r\nand new demands on the Organization. It is very important\r\nthat the international community be properly represented in\r\nthe Security Council. Lithuania therefore supports\r\nproposals to expand the membership of the Council,\r\ncreating new permanent as well as non-permanent seats.\r\nOne of the principle guarantees of international\r\nstability is respect for fundamental human rights and\r\nfreedoms and their development and defence. It was, of\r\ncourse, within the framework of the United Nations that the\r\nfirst landmark international human rights documents were\r\nadopted.\r\nWe believe the establishment of the office of High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights to be a timely decision.\r\nThe High Commissioner must become the overall\r\ncoordinator of United Nations activities in the field of\r\nhuman rights. The world clearly needs an institution that\r\ncan rapidly and effectively report human rights violations,\r\nparticularly those which pose a danger of escalating into\r\nprolonged conflict. Such reporting would enhance the\r\npolicy of preventive diplomacy.\r\nLithuania continues along the difficult road of reform,\r\nmaintaining a relatively high human development index, as\r\nreflected in the United Nations Development Programme’s\r\n1994 report on human development, where it is in twenty-\r\neighth place. We are well aware of the particular\r\ncircumstances of this high ranking and of the fact that it is\r\ncalculated with the use of rather distorted gross national\r\nproduct statistics. Unfortunately, the use of these distorted\r\nfigures has led to excessive contributions to the United\r\nNations and to a reduction in assistance provided.\r\nAt the same time, Lithuania, like other Central\r\nEuropean countries, has despite the odds achieved a high\r\nlevel of development in education, science and culture.\r\nThis, too, is reflected in the human development index.\r\nThis state of affairs has two aspects. As Lithuania cannot\r\neffectively finance these areas from its own resources, an\r\noverall decline is unavoidable. Another possibility\r\nremains: with the help of the United Nations and other\r\norganizations, the decline may be halted in the fields of\r\neducation, science and culture. If the existing foundation\r\nis protected, recovery in the economic and social fields\r\nwill follow more rapidly. Adopting this second solution\r\nwould be less costly and more effective than allowing a\r\ncollapse of the system.\r\nLithuania, like other formerly central-command\r\neconomies, has inherited environmentally damaging\r\ntechnologies. While we have witnessed political and\r\neconomic change, the restoration of a balanced\r\nenvironment in our countries will take many years and\r\nrequire financial resources.\r\nAs the possessor of a powerful nuclear energy\r\nfacility, Lithuania is particularly concerned about nuclear\r\nsafety. Here, I wish to express our particular gratitude to\r\nSweden and other Western European partners for\r\nassistance they provide to increase the safety of our\r\nnuclear energy programme.\r\nLithuania welcomes the increased attention that\r\ninternational environmental organizations are giving to the\r\nconcerns of our region. I believe that combined efforts\r\nare capable of producing results much sooner than we\r\nfirst imagined. But, for this to occur, we must be assured\r\nthat assistance provided by the United Nations will not be\r\nreduced. Of particular relevance to my country is the\r\ntransfer of environmentally sound technology and\r\nknow-how. An ecologically aware civilization must\r\nbecome the goal of our era.\r\nIf the international community does not provide the\r\nnecessary assistance and cooperation the situation in our\r\nregion could change for the worse. The countries of\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe receive a small portion of the\r\ntechnical assistance provided by the United Nations, but\r\nit is employed in our region effectively and with visible\r\nresults.\r\nHere I should like to welcome the reforms initiated\r\nby the Secretary-General. We now see the first results of\r\nthe restructuring, and we are satisfied with the progress.\r\nWe are particularly encouraged by steps taken to increase\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nmanagerial and policy-making accountability within the\r\nSecretariat, as well as the simplification and streamlining of\r\nthe decision-making machinery. Lithuania supports and\r\npledges its full cooperation with the new Office of Internal\r\nOversight.\r\nI would also draw attention to the fact that the United\r\nNations Charter still contains certain outdated concepts\r\nconcerning enemy States. These are a relic of the Second\r\nWorld War. Therefore, I believe Articles 53 and 107 of the\r\nCharter ought to be amended.\r\nOne of this year’s most important international events\r\nwas the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment held recently in Cairo. Next year the United\r\nNations will continue the tradition of transcontinental\r\nforums. The world social Summit in Copenhagen will\r\nafford us an opportunity to put people’s concerns at the\r\ncentre of social policy. This is of particular relevance to\r\ncountries whose economies are in transition, where people\r\ncarry the burden of rapid economic, social and political\r\nchange.\r\nThe World Conference on Women, to be held in\r\nBeijing, will address the key question of how, in times of\r\nawesome change, men and women can work together for a\r\npeaceful world in which equality and harmony will be the\r\nnorm and reality of life.\r\nAt the beginning of my address I spoke of the wheel\r\nof human development being supported by five basic\r\nprinciples. Today we clearly face a time for decisions.\r\nEither that wheel will turn, slowly but surely, through the\r\njoint efforts of us all, taking us towards ever higher plains\r\nof progress, or it will stop turning, and if it stops it will\r\ninevitably begin to roll backwards - to chaos and barbarity.\r\nAs humanity crosses into a new millennium, we must\r\nnot allow the wheel to stop turning. This demands the\r\ncollective action of all States and peoples. That is why we\r\nmust always remind ourselves that no organization in the\r\nworld today can equal the authority, longevity, dynamism\r\nand vitality of the United Nations.\r\nThat which divided nations, States or continents\r\ncannot achieve alone they can and will achieve together as\r\nthe United Nations. I am convinced of this, as there is no\r\nalternative.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, President of the\r\nRepublic of Lithuania, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Rafael Caldera, President of the\r\nRepublic of Venezuela\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Republic of Venezuela.\r\nMr. Rafael Caldera, President of the Republic of\r\nVenezuela, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Venezuela, His Excellency Mr. Rafael\r\nCaldera, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Caldera (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Venezuela,\r\nI wish to congratulate you, Sir, Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of Côte d’Ivoire, on your election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. I am\r\nconfident that under your guidance the Assembly will at\r\nthis important session contribute to progress in the\r\ncarrying out of the important task with which the\r\nOrganization is charged - the constant quest for peace.\r\nI also take pleasure in paying tribute to Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, whose intelligent\r\nand expert leadership have given the world fresh hope, as\r\nwe are about to enter a new millennium, so that we may\r\nbe optimistic about the future, even though there are still\r\ngrounds for concern.\r\nThe twentieth century, which is drawing to a close,\r\nhas witnessed momentous events for mankind. Two\r\nworld wars, which cost an enormous number of human\r\nlives and immense physical, economic and cultural losses,\r\ndemonstrated the extent to which man is capable of\r\ndestruction - above all, self-destruction. The world’s\r\npolitical map has been changed many times, with\r\npredictable consequences.\r\nScience and technology have made remarkable\r\nprogress. The discovery of antibiotics has provided\r\nundreamt-of opportunities for surgery. Surgeons have\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nconverted the human body into a fruitful field for\r\noperations capable of correcting natural defects and injuries\r\narising from circumstances prevailing in an increasingly\r\ncomplex society. Life expectancy has risen steadily, and\r\nterrible endemic diseases that used to claim countless\r\nvictims have vanished almost completely.\r\nCommunications have been the greatest marvel of this\r\ncentury. The twentieth century has been the era of radio\r\nbroadcasting and television. Important events occurring in\r\nany part of the world are immediately known in the most\r\ndistant regions. The fax has supplanted the mails and\r\nimproved on the telegram and the telex. Communications\r\nare the principal reason why the inhabitants of this planet\r\nare gradually recognizing their role as members of a single,\r\nvast community of nations.\r\nOf necessity, institutions have endeavoured to keep in\r\nstep with the rapid and unremitting march of events. Both\r\ninternal and international juridical norms are subject to\r\nconstant change. Fundamental concepts of nationality and\r\nsovereignty are being reconsidered, and formulas are being\r\nsought so that inalienable and traditional rights may exist in\r\nharmony with the requirements of the supranational\r\ncommunity. Amongst these values are the self-\r\ndetermination of nations and non-intervention, as laid down\r\nin the Preamble to our Constitution. Accordingly,\r\nVenezuela has been and remains permanently disposed to\r\npromoting the peaceful spread of democracy to every nation\r\non Earth, and especially to those of our continent. We\r\nhave consequently supported efforts aimed at reintroducing\r\na fully democratic system in those Latin American\r\ncountries where it is not at present established. Their\r\nsituation is inevitably of deep concern to us by reason of\r\nhistory and natural affinities. For the same reason, though,\r\nVenezuela did not support military intervention in Haiti,\r\ndespite the fact that the United Nations has lent it\r\nmultilateral and institutional support.\r\nAt the same time, regional integration is expanding,\r\nwith profound effect on the exercise of rights within every\r\ncountry. This process is rapidly leading to hemispheric and\r\nuniversal integration. For Latin Americans, the bicentennial\r\nof the birth of Antonio José de Sucre, the young man who\r\nconsolidated our independence at the battle of Ayacucho,\r\nwill provide an opportunity to reassert the unbreakable links\r\nof our solidarity. As we see it, the objective of the\r\nforthcoming meeting of Heads of State or Government,\r\nconvened by the President of the United States, will be the\r\nencouragement of a genuinely democratic system in the\r\nAmerican continent and throughout the world. It is our\r\nhope in this regard that there will be a commitment to fight\r\nwithout quarter against poverty and an effective\r\nagreement to stamp out corruption.\r\nThe United Nations has managed to avoid most of\r\nthe obstacles that caused the failure of its immediate\r\npredecessor, the League of Nations. Next year it will\r\ncelebrate its first 50 years of existence: a time in which,\r\namidst contradictions and disappointments, it has provided\r\na unique forum for constant dialogue, in every language\r\nand in the most contrasting tones. It has made\r\nuninterrupted progress and shown a willingness to accept\r\nthe structural changes that changing times have imposed.\r\nFor this reason we are awaiting further changes, such as\r\nthe expansion of permanent representation on the Security\r\nCouncil to Latin America by granting Brazil permanent\r\nmembership. Latin America has every right to this by\r\nvirtue of its spiritual strength and its constant espousal of\r\nliberty and international friendship.\r\nHowever, despite all the progress achieved, it is\r\nundeniable that we are still a very long way from having\r\nestablished a stable, universal peace or a harmonious\r\ncoexistence amongst nations. Nor have we developed\r\nstandards of living that permit all social strata in the\r\nvarious continents to enjoy a fitting human existence, with\r\na satisfactory world-wide level of equity in social\r\nrelations.\r\nThe struggle for human rights has spread\r\nsignificantly, and international treaties have been signed\r\nto ensure that protection of such rights transcends all\r\nborders. But the basic human right to life itself, the right\r\nto work and the right to have enough to eat for healthy\r\nliving are far from having been secured for a considerable\r\npart of mankind.\r\nThe momentous International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, recently held in Cairo,\r\nseemed to be based on the assumption that it is\r\nimpossible to guarantee development interpreted as\r\nparticipation by the whole human being and by all human\r\nbeings in economic and social processes - if the\r\npopulation continues to increase. This is because many\r\ncountries have not ensured, as is essential, that everyone\r\nwho is born will have the means to enjoy a decent\r\nexistence. In my country, at the beginning of the century,\r\na time of manifest poverty and backwardness, there was\r\na saying that every child was born with an arepa under\r\nthe arm. \"Arepa\" is a bread made of maize and is a\r\npopular staple of the daily diet. This saying has now\r\ndropped out of popular usage.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nIn spite of the dramatic repercussions of the events\r\nfollowing the destruction of the Berlin Wall, peace has not\r\nyet been achieved. Just as we were ready to thrill with\r\nemotion at the arrival of universal peace, the Gulf War\r\nawakened us from that dream. Recent conflicts in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia and in Rwanda, two countries so\r\nfundamentally different one from the other, have stirred up\r\nvestiges of barbarism that had supposedly disappeared for\r\never. Religious conflicts and ethnic antagonisms, thought\r\nto have been overcome once and for all, have re-emerged\r\nwith unbelievable bitterness. Events recall the Biblical\r\ncommentary of the Peruvian Victor Andrés Belaunde, an\r\nillustrious Latin American, greatly appreciated in the United\r\nNations, who said that human beings bear the weight of a\r\ncurse implicitly imposed by God when He cast them out of\r\nthe Garden of Eden: Since they refused to be governed by\r\nGod, they would have to govern themselves.\r\nThe United Nations faces a constant challenge: the\r\nquest for peace. It is clear that peace will not be achieved\r\nsimply through political discussion or diplomatic\r\nnegotiation, still less through the mere use of force. It has\r\noften been said by knowledgeable speakers that peace is the\r\nfruit of justice: that is, without some degree of justice,\r\npeace is unattainable.\r\nThat was understood by the negotiators at Versailles\r\nat the end of the First World War when they included in\r\ntheir Peace Treaty a lengthy clause devoted to the\r\nInternational Labour Organization and inspired by the\r\nnotion of social justice. Undoubtedly, however, the need\r\nfor justice goes far beyond international conventions and\r\nrecommendations with regard to labour, and meeting that\r\nneed is becoming a matter of increasing urgency.\r\nThe rapid process of globalization we are witnessing\r\nis unstoppable and unavoidable. The steps being taken in\r\nthis direction are dictated by the state of today’s world and\r\nthe demands of the immediate and mid-term future. The\r\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round and the creation of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization represent undeniable progress for\r\nmankind. The bilateral and multilateral agreements reached\r\non all continents are signs of progress and stimulate the\r\ncreation and exchange of wealth. It is nevertheless\r\nessential to introduce into relations between States\r\ninstruments that will prevent commercial interchange from\r\nbecoming an economic war to the death. It is inappropriate\r\nto transfer to social relations the concept of the struggle for\r\nexistence in the sense that nature itself, through this\r\nstruggle, will automatically ensure the survival of the fittest -\r\nin other words, the absolute predominance of the strongest\r\nand the disappearance of the weakest. The acceptance of\r\nsuch an idea would be a crime against humanity.\r\nIt must be recognized that the United Nations and its\r\nimportant subsidiary bodies have made great efforts to\r\nalleviate the sufferings and shortages of those sectors of\r\nhumanity where the standard of living is below what is\r\ndeemed humanely indispensable. It is encouraging to\r\nnote that institutions directly related to the United Nations\r\nsuch as the World Bank and the International Monetary\r\nFund recognize that the fight against poverty must be a\r\ntop priority. It is not, however, enough to give\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the neediest. It is essential to\r\nafford nations the conditions they require to enable all\r\ntheir inhabitants to compete efficiently, to ensure their\r\nhealthy survival and to encourage their progress.\r\nIt is true that economic-liberalization measures in\r\nless-developed countries have produced positive\r\nmacroeconomic results, but in some countries that point\r\nwith satisfaction to the tremendous economic progress\r\nthey have achieved one can note, at the same time, a\r\ngrowing concern about that portion of the population that\r\nis living in poverty and, even more distressing, in critical\r\nand even extreme poverty.\r\nI share the aspiration voiced by the President of\r\nColombia to a new model of development for our\r\ncountries, for an \"alternative model,\" as he put it when\r\naddressing the Assembly. He proposed the establishment\r\nof\r\n\"a new and more productive citizen in the economy,\r\na citizen who participates to a greater degree in\r\npolitics and who is more supportive in the social\r\nsphere.\" (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nForty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th meeting,\r\n[p. 27])\r\nIn recent years my country, Venezuela, has faced a\r\ndifficult economic situation and disquieting social\r\ncircumstances. Undeniably, the blame lies largely with us.\r\nGrievous mistakes in running the country and the\r\npoisonous plague of corruption are the principal causes of\r\nthe acute crisis we are experiencing, but external factors\r\nhave also played a part. I am not here to pronounce\r\njudgement on the past. As I have pledged to my\r\ncompatriots, I must find ways of restoring the confidence\r\nthat is indispensable if coming generations are to be able,\r\nwith training and hard work, to avail themselves of the\r\nopportunities the country has to offer. Serious\r\ninstitutional problems - such as the legal proceedings\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nagainst two former Presidents of the Republic, one of\r\nwhom was suspended from office while still President -\r\nhave been handled within the legal system with strict\r\nadherence to the Constitution. The people’s conduct has\r\nbeen truly exemplary. The natural resources with which\r\nprovidence has endowed us and the favourable prospects\r\nguaranteed by our human resource, our people, who have\r\nalways demonstrated intelligence, creative audacity and\r\ncourage in times of danger, inspire us with optimism. We\r\nrealize that we must seek within ourselves the essential\r\nelements that will enable us to win the struggle for\r\ndevelopment to which we are so seriously committed. We\r\nhave put forward an economic stabilization and recovery\r\nprogramme that has been in large part accepted. It lays out\r\na feasible and clearly defined course that will ultimately\r\nlead to a solution of the crisis. However, we feel that we\r\nare in duty bound to explain to international forums, and\r\nmost particularly to this world forum, the need for\r\nfavourable prospects to open up that can help us to avoid\r\nexerting our efforts in vain and ensure instead that they will\r\nbe successful and will contribute to a better future for\r\nmankind.\r\nFor example, when considering the need to strengthen\r\ntrade relations throughout the world we must call for\r\nguaranteed access to the markets of the developed\r\ncountries, where mechanisms are sometimes in place that\r\nare skillfully used to exclude our competition. We agree\r\nwith the need for environmental protection for the benefit\r\nof the world’s inhabitants, and we are certainly ready to\r\ncontribute to that goal. However, we must make the point\r\nthat on more than one occasion the ecological struggle for\r\na healthy environment has been hypocritically used as a\r\nway to prevent developing countries from gaining access to\r\nthe markets of wealthy nations. We further believe that\r\ntransfer of technology must be wide ranging and genuine,\r\nfor if it is not the gap between us and the developed\r\ncountries, which increases every year, will ultimately\r\nbecome impossible to bridge and will lead to a sharp and\r\nbitter rift between two sectors of mankind, with\r\nunforeseeable but undoubtedly disastrous consequences.\r\nAccess to capital is a requirement that is becoming\r\never more acute as technological advances make productive\r\nprocesses more capital- and less labour-intensive. At the\r\nsame time, there must be fair payment for the raw materials\r\nthat represent the principal contribution of the\r\nunderdeveloped countries to international trade but that are\r\nconstantly losing their relevance in end products.\r\nConsequently, access to capital must be arranged on\r\nequitable terms to protect the interests of producers, who\r\nare often obliged to accept conditions that are little more\r\nthan adhesion contracts. This struggle to obtain better\r\nprices for raw materials, which are almost invariably\r\nsubject to conditions imposed by consumer countries\r\nwithout any real participation by the producers, and the\r\nestablishment of reasonable terms for international loans\r\nare part of the struggle for justice and an integral part of\r\nthe struggle for peace.\r\nThe external-debt problem of the developing\r\ncountries is still far from being solved. It is true that\r\nthere have been negotiations on restructuring and that\r\nthey have temporarily alleviated the dreadful burden that\r\nproblem represents for the debtor countries, but as the\r\nrepayment deadlines fall due the burden for those in debt\r\nbecomes harder to bear with the passing of every year.\r\nTo cite a concrete example: in my country next year’s\r\ndebt servicing payments will amount to 35 per cent of the\r\nnational budget, and in coming years the situation will\r\nbecome even more acute. The drop in the price of our\r\nmain export has made it very difficult to meet the basic\r\nneeds of our population. We have never given any\r\nthought to disavowing our obligations. We are resolved\r\nto meet them, but we consider that this subject must be\r\nplaced on international agendas and that a search must\r\nbegin for a broad solution that will open up new horizons\r\nof justice and peace.\r\nI believe that as we approach the beginning of the\r\nsecond half of the United Nations first century the\r\nfundamental aim of the United Nations must be the search\r\nfor justice in relations among peoples.\r\nSocial justice has been one of the most important\r\nachievements of this twentieth century that is now\r\ndrawing to a close. This demands of every individual and\r\nevery group whatever is required for the common good.\r\nAbove and beyond the numerical equality of commutative\r\njustice, it also requires of all of us that we make a\r\ncontribution to the community of nations in proportion to\r\nour individual possibilities. This concept has still not\r\ngained acceptance in the international field. It is true that\r\nthere have been some minor concessions to the most\r\nneedy countries but there is a lack of any clear course\r\ntowards the achievement of universal well-being. It is not\r\nonly States that should be the agents. Once the door was\r\nopened by the International Labour Organization (ILO),\r\ninternational organizations also provided access for\r\nunofficial bodies. The large transnational corporations\r\nwhich have and exercise real power must become\r\ninvolved in the management of programmes that will seek\r\npeace through justice; economic justice in so far as it\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nconcerns them; and respect for the sovereignty of both\r\nlarge and small States.\r\nThose of us who love freedom; those of us who have\r\nstruggled to achieve it, regardless of cost and sacrifice;\r\nthose of us who consider democracy and respect for human\r\nrights as priority objectives; those of us who sincerely\r\nyearn for friendship and fruitful understanding among all\r\nnations; those of us who believe in dialogue and resolutely\r\nsupport the endeavours of the United Nations to encourage\r\nit - all of us desire to see the United Nations displaying\r\nunflinching determination that the search for justice - and\r\nI shall never tire of repeating this - must play a key role in\r\nthe building of peace.\r\nIf peace is our goal let us strive to make justice its\r\nfoundation. In this way we shall realize the ideal which\r\nour Liberator, Simon Bolivar, visualized as the most\r\nimportant goal of the best system of government: \"the\r\ngreatest possible degree of happiness\", in other words,\r\nhappiness for all.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Venezuela for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Rafael Caldera, President of the Republic of\r\nVenezuela, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda Item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral Debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The first\r\nspeaker in the resumed general debate is the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and International\r\nCooperation of Cambodia, His Royal Highness Prince\r\nNorodom Sirivudh, on whom I now call.\r\nPrince Norodom Sirivudh (Cambodia)(interpretation\r\nfrom French): On this solemn occasion allow me first to\r\nconvey to you, Sir, on behalf of the Cambodian delegation,\r\nheartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency\r\nof the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. Your election is very important because it is a\r\ntribute not only to your diplomatic skills, to someone\r\nexperienced in international affairs, but also to the tireless\r\nwork done by Côte d’Ivoire, your glorious country, for\r\npeace.\r\nI am delighted to take this opportunity to convey to\r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally,\r\nour satisfaction at the exemplary way in which he\r\npresided over the work of last year’s session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe wish also to congratulate the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on the\r\nmany efforts he has constantly made for peace and\r\nsecurity throughout the world since he has been at the\r\nhead of the Organization. The Kingdom of Cambodia\r\nreiterates its firm support to the Secretary-General.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIt gives me particular pride to be here today as the\r\nrepresentative of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The Royal\r\nGovernment under the First Prime Minister, His Royal\r\nHighness Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and the Second\r\nPrime Minister, Samdech Hun Sen, was installed as the\r\nlegitimate Government of Cambodia a little more than a\r\nyear ago, on 24 September 1993, through the foresight,\r\ngenerosity and courage of the Members of the United\r\nNations and the bravery of the Cambodian people in\r\nchoosing, through United Nations-sponsored elections, a\r\nliberal democracy, building up national reconciliation\r\nunder the high guidance of His Majesty King Norodom\r\nSihanouk.\r\nI have come here today to represent the Cambodian\r\npeople in expressing our warmest gratitude to the\r\nMembers of the United Nations for their wonderful gift of\r\nfreedom. After 23 years of war Cambodia is now at\r\npeace and able to start to move towards development,\r\nsocial justice and prosperity. This has not been an easy\r\ntask because our financial base is still very low. As a\r\nmember of the group of least developed countries,\r\nCambodia remains one of the poorest countries in the\r\nworld and a large proportion of its people are saddled\r\nwith crushing poverty. But, again, the United Nations is\r\nat our side. The Bretton Woods institutions are helping\r\nus to re-establish a solid fiscal base and the specialized\r\nagencies have almost all moved in to assist development\r\nand strengthen our institutions.\r\nIn the economic field, there has been some progress\r\nover the past few years. According to the 1992 report,\r\nthe inflation rate was estimated to be 300 per cent, but in\r\n1993 it dropped to 70 per cent. This year our local\r\ncurrency is very stable: 1 dollar is equal to 2,500 riels.\r\nBilateral donors have also been generous, and as\r\nassistance moves from the area of emergency\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nrehabilitation to that of reconstruction, achievements are\r\nbeginning to be noted.\r\nHowever, the most important of the Royal\r\nGovernment’s priorities for reconstruction and rural\r\ndevelopment have unfortunately lagged behind other kinds\r\nof development. The constraints of distance, an\r\ninfrastructure ruined by two decades of war and a\r\ncontinuing insurgency have hampered efforts, but in our\r\nsecond year of office, the Government, together with our\r\nfriends, will tackle those problems. Infrastructure can be\r\nrebuilt, and our king, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, is\r\nleading the move for reconciliation with the insurgents, the\r\nso-called Khmer Rouge group, who do not recognize the\r\nUnited Nations-sponsored elections and continue to\r\nchallenge the legally elected democratic government, and\r\nabove all have rejected the cease-fire that has been\r\nproposed through His Majesty’s tireless efforts.\r\nPlease allow me to reiterate, on behalf of all the\r\npeople of Cambodia, our deep and lasting gratitude to all of\r\nthe States Members of the United Nations and to the\r\nindividual bilateral donors who have so generously\r\nsupported reconstruction in our country, both through the\r\nUnited Nations and its institutions, and through their\r\npledges at the first and second ministerial meetings of the\r\nIntergovernmental Committees on the Reconstruction of\r\nCambodia (ICORC), held in Paris and Tokyo respectively.\r\nWith the assistance of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) we have now developed our first\r\ncountry programme, which will be presented to the\r\nExecutive Board of UNDP on 6 October 1994.\r\nThe UNDP is also assisting us to reform the civil\r\nadministration within Cambodia.\r\nMany other specialized agencies of the United Nations\r\nare also doing excellent work within the country: the United\r\nNations Population Fund, the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund, the International Labour Organization, the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,\r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations and the World Food Programme, to name a few.\r\nCambodia has itself been through the holocaust of\r\ntyranny, invasion and internal disturbances. Our National\r\nAssembly is now in the process of restoring Cambodia as\r\na judicial State where human rights, political pluralism,\r\nliberal democracy and, above all, freedom of expression are\r\nrespected, as envisaged in our Constitution. To this end,\r\nwe have been grateful for the support and encouragement\r\nof the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of\r\nthe United Nations, whose close cooperation with the\r\nCambodian Government has helped us in our task of re-\r\nestablishing law and confidence in the country.\r\nCambodia is the only country in the region to have\r\nasked the Secretary-General of the United Nations to\r\ndispatch a special representative for human rights. In\r\ncomparison with the twenty years of war and\r\ntotalitarianism under the previous regimes, progress has\r\nbeen made. We also appreciate the early visit of the\r\nnewly appointed United Nations Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights, the Honorable José Ayala Lasso.\r\nBecause of our own terrible experiences, Cambodia\r\nfeels to the depths of its soul for the plight of the\r\nordinary people in Rwanda. We congratulate the\r\ninternational community for its intervention in Rwanda\r\nand we are pleased to see that the situation is now\r\nstabilized. In particular, we wish to applaud and\r\ncommend the French for the rapid action they took to\r\nhelp put an end to the killing and suffering of the\r\nRwandese people.\r\nOn the same basis, Cambodia wishes to call on the\r\nrival factions in the former Yugoslavia to stop their\r\nfighting and cooperate with the United Nations.\r\nCambodia is, of course, well acquainted with the Special\r\nRepresentative of the United Nations Secretary-General in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, His Excellency Mr. Yasushi\r\nAkashi, and is full of admiration for, and confidence in,\r\nhis efforts to restore peace and security to the people of\r\nthat troubled region.\r\nAgain, from the Cambodian experience of using\r\ndemocratic elections as a catalyst for peace, we wish to\r\ncongratulate the people of South Africa and the new\r\ndemocratic government led by President Nelson Mandela,\r\non their move towards a normalization of the lives of the\r\npeople and on the return of South Africa to the world’s\r\nembrace.\r\nCambodia fully supports the Geneva Declaration of\r\n12 August 1994 between the United States of America\r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and\r\nhopes that the Declaration will be fully and sincerely\r\nimplemented. Cambodia strongly supports the earnest\r\ndesires of the Korean people who, in the not-too-distant\r\nfuture, will bring their beloved country towards full\r\nreunification.\r\nCambodia welcomed the just initiative taken by the\r\ninternational community on the question of Haiti to avoid\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nbloodshed and to oversee the smooth transition to a\r\ndemocratically elected government. Cambodia calls on the\r\npeople of Haiti to work towards the national reconciliation\r\nand development of their country under the democratically\r\nelected president, Jean Bertrand Aristide.\r\nWe pray for an end to the senseless killing in\r\nAfghanistan, so that the Afghan people may be able to\r\nresume their normal lives and rebuild and develop their\r\nwar-torn nation.\r\nWe are pleased to see the political outcome in\r\nNorthern Ireland and hope that peace and happiness will\r\nsoon return to that beautiful land.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East has brought us great\r\njoy. The peace agreement between Israel and the\r\nPalestinian people is the most encouraging historical event\r\nof our time.\r\nThe recent accord between Israel and Jordan is\r\ndefinitely the right step towards peace, security and stability\r\nin that region. We encourage others to follow the example\r\nof this discussion for a peaceful world.\r\nCambodia is situated in south-east Asia, in the Asia-\r\nPacific region. As we have moved towards development\r\nand prosperity for the Kingdom we have welcomed the\r\nfriendship of the member countries of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which invited\r\nCambodia to be a special guest for the second time at the\r\ntwenty-seventh annual ministerial meeting held in Bangkok\r\nin July 1994. At an appropriate time, Cambodia looks\r\nforward with great enthusiasm to full membership in\r\nASEAN. We will be delighted to see all 10 countries of\r\nour subregion one day join in the great ASEAN family.\r\nThis will be a positive development for harmony and\r\nsecurity in our part of the world. ASEAN has done a great\r\ndeal for Cambodia during our difficult years, and for this\r\nwe are eternally grateful to all of its six distinguished\r\nmembers: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,\r\nSingapore and Thailand. Cambodia also welcomes the\r\npositive developments around the continuing growth of the\r\nAsia Pacific Economic Community. To use the economic\r\nachievements of the most prosperous of the nations of our\r\nwider region as a springboard for further growth, peace and\r\nstability is something that Cambodia highly values.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn addition to the constant efforts made by the\r\nCambodian authorities to rebuild our country after the\r\ndisastrous 20 years of war, Cambodia also aspires to\r\nrejoin the international community as a State of law.\r\nThe policy of neutrality and peaceful coexistence\r\nadvocated by His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk since\r\nthe period of Sangkum Reastr Niyum - People’s Socialist\r\nCommunity - which lasted from the 1950s to the 1970s,\r\nremains the key to our foreign policy in order to promote\r\npeace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nCambodia is committed to development and peace\r\nfor the well-being of our people, and we heartily welcome\r\nthe important appeal by Mr. Clinton, President of the\r\nUnited States, for the elimination of anti-personnel land-\r\nmines throughout the world, as the sine qua non for\r\ndevelopment and lasting peace. Our people bear the scars\r\nof these deadly practices, and a sincere commitment from\r\nthe international community would save the lives of\r\ninnocent men, women and children throughout the world.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank sincerely\r\nall donor countries for their generous contributions to the\r\nCambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC).\r\nThe globalization of national socio-cultural policies\r\ncan be harmonious only if there is close and sincere\r\ncooperation between the industrialized countries and the\r\ndeveloping countries. Hence, we wish to pay tribute to\r\nthe international community for its support for the\r\nInternational Committee to Save the Temples of Angkor\r\nWat, in particular, the valuable work done by UNESCO\r\nand the École Française d’extrème orient. The temples\r\nof Angkor Wat, one of the seven wonders of the world,\r\nhave been designated the common heritage of mankind.\r\nCambodia is also concerned about environmental\r\nissues, and will be signing the Agreement to Combat\r\nDesertification in Paris.\r\nCambodia welcomes the convening of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, to be held in\r\nCopenhagen, and the World Conference on Women, to be\r\nheld in Beijing next year. We give particular attention to\r\nthe development of our human sources, because of its\r\nimplications for the process of social stabilization.\r\nCambodia will actively participate in the work of these\r\nsummits.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nCambodia welcomes the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations and has already set up a\r\nnational committee to participate in various events to be\r\nheld next year.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to voice sincere gratitude to\r\nthe United Nations for the deployment of peace-keeping\r\nforces, and Cambodia takes this opportunity to inform the\r\ninternational community that it will make available its small\r\npeace-keeping forces at the request of this Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, Cambodia remains convinced that\r\nMember States will respond to emergencies and will meet\r\ntheir obligations. Cambodia is solemnly committed to\r\ncomplying with the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Spain, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Javier Solana.\r\nMr. Solana (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nshould like to convey to you, Sir, my warmest\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of this\r\nAssembly and to wish you great success in the performance\r\nof your duties. With your election, the members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly recognize in your country, Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nthe decisive contribution of Africa to the work of the\r\nOrganization. I am confident that the General Assembly\r\nwill follow the course of consensus that was set in the\r\nprevious session, under the leadership of Ambassador\r\nInsanally, to whom I should like to pay a warm tribute.\r\nMoreover, I wish to once again assure Mr.\r\nBoutros-Ghali, who honoured us last April with his official\r\nvisit to my country, of the full cooperation of the Spanish\r\nauthorities in assisting him in the difficult task he faces of\r\nmeeting the increasingly complex challenges with which\r\nour Organization is faced.\r\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Germany, in his address on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, has set forth our common points of view\r\nin this general debate. These reflect the advances made on\r\nthe path to a common foreign and security policy, which is\r\na major goal of the Union. On behalf of my delegation, I\r\nwish now to consider some issues in more detail.\r\nThe fundamental changes in the international system\r\nthat we have witnessed in recent years have provided the\r\nUnited Nations with the great opportunity finally to\r\nestablish itself as the venue for the universal harmonization\r\nof the efforts of the international community to fulfil the\r\ncommon purposes contained in its Charter. However,\r\nthey have also confronted the Organization with one of\r\nthe greatest challenges in its history. Some have even\r\ncast doubt on the actual ability of the United Nations to\r\ncontribute effectively to the solution of the many conflicts\r\nthat have arisen or have been rekindled over the past few\r\nyears.\r\nAfter the first shock, provoked by crises such as\r\nthose in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and Angola, we\r\nhave been confronted with appalling situations such as\r\nthat in Rwanda, where the Organization’s limited means\r\nhave unfortunately proved insufficient to redress the\r\nplight of millions of human beings.\r\nAt the same time, the United Nations, with its\r\nresources stretched to the limit, is undergoing a financial\r\ncrisis which can be addressed only with the resolute\r\ncooperation of the Member States. This should entail,\r\nfirst of all, the timely payment of their financial\r\ncontributions, an obligation specified in the Charter. Only\r\nthen will the Organization have the necessary means to\r\nachieve its objectives. Moreover, these means must be\r\nused in the most effective possible way.\r\nBeyond the efforts for renewal already achieved or\r\nin progress, we must undertake a process of careful\r\nconsideration at the highest level, with a view to deciding\r\nwhether we are willing to provide the Organization with\r\nthe legal, material and financial instruments it needs to\r\nmeet successfully the growing demands made on it by the\r\ninternational community. The credibility of the United\r\nNations is at stake.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is an extremely\r\nimportant and complex matter, which will have to be\r\naccomplished through a careful process of dialogue\r\nleading to an understanding among all Member States.\r\nSpain, which in the last two years has been a\r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council, reiterates\r\nits position in favour of a revision, without undue haste,\r\nof the composition and functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil, based on the criteria of representativity,\r\nefficiency and transparency, with the ultimate goal of\r\nreinforcing the legitimacy of the actions of the Council.\r\nSpain, which has taken and will continue to take an\r\nactive part in the meetings of the Ad Hoc Working Group\r\nof this Assembly, favours a moderate increase of the\r\nCouncil’s membership. This would allow for a more\r\nfrequent presence in the Council of States with specific\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nweight and influence in international relations, and which\r\nare, likewise, able and willing to contribute in a significant\r\nway to the maintenance of international peace and security\r\nand to fulfil the other purposes of the United Nations. The\r\nenlarged composition of the Council will also facilitate\r\nequitable geographical distribution among the different\r\nregions of the world.\r\nFrightening events, such as those in Rwanda, make it\r\nmore necessary than ever to continue the strengthening of\r\nthe indispensable machinery for action required to execute\r\nthe increasingly broad and complex mandates given by the\r\nSecurity Council to peace-keeping operations.\r\nFirst of all, we must further improve the management\r\nand control mechanisms here in New York. The Secretariat\r\nhas already made a major effort to strengthen the\r\nDepartment of Peace-keeping Operations by adding a\r\nSituation Centre, enlarging the Office of the Military\r\nAdviser and giving a boost to the planning unit.\r\nSecondly, in order to speed up the effective launching\r\nof operations, the provisions relating to standby\r\narrangements for peace-keeping should come into effect.\r\nSpain is prepared to participate in this mechanism, which\r\nshould be broadened to include the police components of\r\npeace operations, as well as transport-related equipment and\r\nlogistics in general.\r\nThirdly, it is important to face the issues relating to\r\nthe safety of the personnel of the peace-keeping operations.\r\nMany casualties have been suffered by United Nations\r\nforces and humanitarian-assistance personnel, among them\r\nSpanish nationals who gave their lives in the quest for\r\npeace.\r\nThe setting up of an Ad Hoc Committee on the safety\r\nand security of United Nations and associated personnel, in\r\nparticular those involved in peace-keeping operations, has\r\nbeen a step in the right direction, and we hope that the draft\r\ninternational convention on this matter will be adopted.\r\nNotwithstanding the continuous efforts of the\r\ninternational community and of many of the political forces\r\nin the area, peace has not yet arrived in the Balkans. It is\r\ntrue that developments have occurred that give us cause for\r\nhope. We have witnessed a new international cohesiveness,\r\nwhich we must preserve at all costs. A rapprochement has\r\ntaken place between the Croat and Muslim communities,\r\nwhich has led to the agreements reached on federation. I\r\nam pleased to underscore the important role that the\r\nEuropean Union is playing in the town of Mostar as a\r\ncontribution to this process. Spain is actively\r\nparticipating in this effort; this is the area in which the\r\nSpanish contingent in the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) is carrying out its mission.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the International\r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia.\r\nWe trust that the experience gained by this ad hoc\r\ntribunal will serve as an incentive to the General\r\nAssembly to give favourable consideration to the\r\nproposed statute of an international criminal court, a\r\npermanent body with universal jurisdiction, which was\r\ndrafted by the International Law Commission, and that\r\nthis idea - which is not new - will come to fruition very\r\nsoon.\r\nSpain welcomes the process of political and\r\neconomic transition in which the countries of Central and\r\nEastern Europe are currently involved. Their future\r\naccession to the European Union and their progressive\r\nintegration in the security mechanisms of the continent\r\nwill contribute to the stability of Europe.\r\nWe are also witnessing important moves towards\r\ndemocracy and a free-market economy in the Russian\r\nFederation and in the other States that emerged from the\r\nformer Soviet Union. Spain supports these changes, as\r\ntheir success will contribute not only to strengthening\r\nsecurity in Europe but to world peace as well.\r\nThe community of Ibero-American nations has\r\nendowed itself with a political forum of considerable\r\nimportance; this year, in Cartagena, Colombia, it once\r\nagain voiced satisfaction at the progress made on the path\r\nto democracy and economic modernization.\r\nWherever internal armed conflicts are still active, as\r\nin Guatemala, we are witnessing a negotiation process\r\npromoted by and under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, with the assistance of the \"Group of Friends\".\r\nBoth the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad\r\nrevolucionaria nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) are fully\r\nengaged in this process, with the ultimate goal of\r\nachieving national reconciliation and full respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nThe delicate situation in Cuba calls for an additional\r\neffort to promote dialogue and cooperation to make\r\npossible the final incorporation of both the Government\r\nand the people of Cuba into the democratic current that is\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nflowing through the continent at the present time. Dialogue\r\nis essential. Inventive solutions among Cubans, without\r\nexcluding anyone, should be encouraged, with a view to\r\nopening up new democratic possibilities leading to a\r\npeaceful transition, with due respect for human rights,\r\nnational sovereignty and fundamental freedoms. The\r\nGovernment of Spain, which remains opposed to the\r\nembargo that has been imposed, notes with satisfaction the\r\ntalks taking place between Washington and Havana, where\r\nthese issues can be addressed.\r\nThe Government of Spain is attentively following the\r\nsituation in Haiti, with a view to the full implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 917 (1994) and 940 (1994),\r\nwhich will involve the return of the President legitimately\r\nelected by the Haitian people. The international community\r\nwill have to concentrate its efforts on the reconstruction of\r\nthe country, so that democracy may rest on solid\r\nfoundations guaranteeing constitutional rule of law and\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nSpain attaches particular importance to the\r\nestablishment of a new process of dialogue and cooperation\r\nin the Mediterranean that will make it possible to tackle the\r\neconomic, demographic and cultural differences existing in\r\nthe region, and to bring peace and prosperity to the\r\nMediterranean area.\r\nMy country has special ties of friendship and\r\ncooperation with the Maghreb countries and is striving to\r\nmake a practical contribution to overcoming the problems\r\nexisting in this area, to which Spain attaches great priority.\r\nThe Spanish Government considers that the solution to\r\nthe problem of the Western Sahara lies in the holding of a\r\nreferendum on self-determination with all appropriate\r\ninternational guarantees. My Government again expresses\r\nits support for the Secretary-General and his Special\r\nRepresentative in their efforts to ensure progress in\r\nimplementing the settlement plan accepted by the parties\r\nand, in accordance with the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, creating the necessary conditions for the\r\nforthcoming holding of the referendum to which I have\r\nreferred.\r\nThe Spanish Government has expressed on many\r\noccasions, its profound satisfaction at the progress achieved\r\nin the Middle East peace process, which started at the\r\nMadrid Conference. Thanks to the determination and\r\ncourage of the interested parties, 1994 has been a year of\r\nsignificant achievements on the path to peace and\r\nunderstanding. Spain has always supported the need for a\r\nlasting and comprehensive peace, in conformity with\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\r\nSpain urges the parties and all the States in the region, on\r\nthe basis of their clear and unanimous rejection of\r\nviolence and the use of force, to coordinate all efforts\r\nnecessary to attain the desired goals of peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThis year, we have witnessed events of remarkable\r\nimportance in sub-Saharan Africa. Some have struck a\r\nmarkedly hopeful note, whereas others - such as the\r\ntragedy of Rwanda and the difficulties in the peace\r\nprocess in Somalia - have demonstrated the fragility of\r\nthe continent’s structures.\r\nRwanda has appalled us. We have witnessed the\r\nhorrors of civil war with a feeling of bitterness and even\r\nof impotence. Despite the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity, in which my country is actively participating,\r\nno solution is yet in sight to this crisis or to the problem\r\nposed by the millions of displaced people and refugees -\r\na problem which, moreover, is having serious\r\nrepercussions on the stability of the neighbouring\r\ncountries.\r\nThose responsible for the atrocities, including\r\ngenocide, committed in Rwanda must be brought to\r\njustice individually. Hence, Spain supports the work of\r\nthe Commission of Experts established under Security\r\nCouncil resolution 935 (1994), which we actively\r\npromoted and co-sponsored, as well as the work of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special\r\nRapporteur for Rwanda. These events are extremely\r\nserious and we must make an urgent legal response to\r\nthem through the establishment of an ad hoc jurisdiction\r\nfor Rwanda, following the model already provided by the\r\nTribunal established to deal with the former Yugoslavia.\r\nSouth Africa has been the other side of the coin.\r\nWe are gratified at its return to the General Assembly as\r\na full-fledged Member of the United Nations, now that\r\nthe apartheid system has been abolished and a democratic\r\nand non-racial Government has been installed.\r\nIn southern Africa, likewise, we are following with\r\nthe greatest interest, because of their importance, the\r\nprocesses aimed at peace in Angola and Mozambique.\r\nWe hope that the Angolan Government and UNITA will\r\nshortly conclude a lasting peace agreement that will put\r\nan end to decades of suffering. We hope that in\r\nMozambique the coming elections will consolidate\r\nnational reconciliation. Spain will contribute to the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\npeaceful and democratic holding of these elections by\r\nsending observers.\r\nThe decolonization of Gibraltar is a priority goal of\r\nthe Spanish Government. The General Assembly has\r\nclearly established the doctrine that the decolonization of\r\nGibraltar is a case not of self-determination but of the\r\nrestoration of Spain’s territorial integrity. I wish here to\r\nreiterate the Spanish Government’s firm resolve to continue\r\nthe process of negotiation with the Government of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, in a constructive spirit and on the bases\r\nof the Declaration of Brussels of 27 November 1984, taking\r\nduly into account the legitimate interests of the population.\r\nThe Government of Spain expresses its profound hope that\r\nthese negotiations will put an end to this colonial\r\nanachronism.\r\nDisarmament and arms control are fundamental factors\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nAccordingly, during this year Spain has adopted a unilateral\r\nmoratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines, has\r\nratified the 1980 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions\r\non the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May\r\nBe Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have\r\nIndiscriminate Effects and was among the first States to\r\nratify the chemical weapons Convention. We also support\r\nthe unconditional and indefinite extension of the non-\r\nproliferation Treaty and the early conclusion of a nuclear\r\ntest-ban treaty.\r\nMoreover, Spain hopes that a final decision on the\r\nenlargement of the membership of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament will be adopted shortly, thereby allowing for\r\nthe full participation of countries which, like Spain, have\r\ndemonstrated for many years their full commitment to the\r\nwork of the Conference.\r\nThe close relationship between peace and development\r\nis especially well reflected in the report on agenda for\r\ndevelopment submitted last May by the Secretary-General.\r\nI wish to state my satisfaction at the publication of this\r\nreport. We share the approach presented by the\r\nSecretary-General, which is based on the principle that\r\ndevelopment is a fundamental right and the strongest\r\nfoundation for peace. We welcome the idea of defining the\r\nfive principal dimensions of development that are set forth\r\nin the agenda - that is, peace as the basic foundation, the\r\neconomy as the engine of progress, the environment as a\r\nbasis for sustainability, justice as a pillar of society, and\r\ndemocracy as a guarantor of good governance.\r\nWe must now determine what actions are required in\r\norder to implement the agenda and formulate specific\r\nrecommendations on the assumption that development\r\ncannot be reduced to a simple economic dimension, but\r\nmust, rather, be considered from its political, cultural,\r\nenvironmental, social and humanitarian angles. Only by\r\nmeans of this comprehensive approach will we be able to\r\ntackle the deep inequalities and serious problems affecting\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nFurthermore, the financial resources devoted to this\r\nend should be used in a more rational and efficient way.\r\nTo achieve this, we must continue to restructure the\r\neconomic and social sectors of the Organization and of\r\nthe United Nations system, particularly by strengthening\r\neven further the coordinating role of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\nIn activities to promote development the protection\r\nof the environment should always be taken into account.\r\nStarting next year, Spain will participate in the work of\r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development, which at its\r\nlast session dealt for the first time with the\r\nimplementation of \"Agenda 21\" and of other agreements\r\nreached at the Rio Summit.\r\nThe global conferences convened by the United\r\nNations play an outstanding role in the search for\r\nuniversal consensus on development. The Programme of\r\nAction adopted in Cairo by the International Conference\r\non Population and Development will pave the way for a\r\nnew demographic policy, and places women at the axis of\r\nevery population policy. The key role played by women\r\nin development will also be highlighted during the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing in\r\nSeptember 1995.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development, which\r\nwill be convened in Copenhagen in March 1995, must,\r\nlikewise, direct us to a new way of facing social problems\r\nin the world, based on the principle that human beings\r\nshould be the core and ultimate goal of development.\r\nNobody can doubt the importance of the protection,\r\npromotion and defence of human rights as fundamental\r\ntasks of both Member States and the United Nations.\r\nIntolerance, inequalities of all kinds and violations of\r\nfundamental rights still endanger the lives, the freedom\r\nand the safety of millions of human beings. In order to\r\neradicate these evils, we must honour the commitments\r\nundertaken during the Vienna World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights and redouble our efforts to put into\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\npractice principles that, although universally acknowledged,\r\nare not universally observed.\r\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights, the office which was created by this Assembly last\r\nyear, and whose first incumbent is Ambassador Ayala\r\nLasso, must be able to perform his duties properly. To this\r\nend, it is essential to ensure that he has the adequate\r\nbudgetary means and sufficient personnel, as well as the\r\nsupport and cooperation of all Member States. Such\r\npersonnel and additional means should also be made\r\navailable to the Centre for Human Rights.\r\nIn 1995 we shall commemorate the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations. This will be an opportunity to\r\nreflect both on the Organization’s accomplishments - which\r\nare not negligible - and on the challenges it will face. We\r\nlive in an increasingly complex and dynamic international\r\nsociety, in which it is no longer possible totally to separate\r\nnational issues from international ones, nor to divide the\r\ntasks of the Organization into watertight compartments.\r\nMankind’s full development will be achieved only when its\r\nmultiple aspects, which are complementary and\r\ninterdependent, are taken into account. The path to a better\r\nworld, in which the United Nations continues to play a\r\nfundamental role, must be taken together by all the peoples\r\nof the world, as we are reminded by the motto of the\r\nfiftieth-anniversary commemoration. That is also the firm\r\nconviction of the Government and the people of Spain.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amre Moussa. I invite him to make his\r\nstatement.\r\nMr. Moussa (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nMr. President, at the outset, I should like to extend to you,\r\nbrother Minister Amara Essy our congratulations on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. Allow\r\nme also to extend through you our congratulations to the\r\nsisterly country Côte d’Ivoire, with which Egypt enjoys\r\nbonds of friendship and cooperation. I take this opportunity\r\nalso to commend your predecessor, Ambassador Insanally,\r\nthe representative of Guyana.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not pay special tribute to\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is conducting with his\r\nwell-known acumen and ability the work of this\r\nOrganization amid turbulent political waves and rapid\r\ninternational changes, and in the face of rising expectations\r\nregarding the role that the United Nations could play in the\r\nworld of today and tomorrow.\r\nAs we know, earlier this month, the International\r\nConference on Population and Development was held in\r\nCairo. We in Egypt are greatly satisfied that the\r\nConference concluded with a Programme of Action that\r\ndeals with population questions from their cultural and\r\ndevelopment perspectives, on the basis of a profound\r\nunderstanding of the various dimensions of this problem.\r\nUndoubtedly, the clamour that accompanied that\r\nConference was justified. Quite rightly, some have called\r\nattention to the fact that as the cultures of various nations\r\ndiffer from each other, there is no justification whatsoever\r\nto the imposition on any nation of a way of life it does\r\nnot approve of, a way of thinking it does not palate or\r\npractices which it does not accept. On top of all that,\r\nthere is the need to respect all religions, and to take into\r\naccount the virtues they preach and the guidelines they\r\nembody for the conduct of individuals and nations.\r\nIt might be important in this connection to refer to\r\nthe consecutive conferences that have been held in the\r\n1990s to deal with the social aspects of development. We\r\nbelieve that henceforth, the attention of developing\r\ncountries and of all other societies should be focused on\r\ndealing with these aspects. This is what all peoples of\r\nthe world have aspired after throughout the long years of\r\ninternational conflict which led to social and economic\r\nconvulsions that resulted in backwardness, misery and\r\nuntold suffering for millions of people.\r\nWhile we emphasize our interest in this approach\r\nthat relates to social development and its global character,\r\nwe also believe that the role of the United Nations therein\r\nis highly significant. Undoubtedly, the United Nations\r\nsponsorship of international conferences to this end\r\nconsolidates its role in shaping the world of tomorrow,\r\nwhich must be a world of equitable development,\r\ncollective security and social stability.\r\nI have made a point of beginning my statement by\r\naddressing the social dimension, in order to underline a\r\nnew tendency and a renewed awareness of this significant\r\naspect of international life. I call upon all countries to\r\naccord that aspect the high priority it has denied for\r\ndecades, during the cold war with its international\r\nconflicts that impacted negatively, not only on the social\r\nagenda, but also on international action in that respect and\r\nbeclouded people’s awareness of its significance and\r\neffects.\r\nDuring the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly, Egypt called for a new international social\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\ncontract, to be formulated by all the world cultures and\r\nsocieties, so that it may act as a safety valve for the\r\ninternational community both now and in future.\r\nRealization of this vision will require, first and foremost,\r\nthe creation of an appropriate international social\r\nenvironment, that would be inspired by the specific and\r\ndistinctive characteristics of all societies and that would\r\nenrich the heritage of mankind. This could be done only\r\nthrough awareness of and respect for the integration and\r\ninteraction of cultures.\r\nProceeding from its awareness of the movement of\r\nhistory, Egypt was the first to sow the seeds of peace in the\r\nMiddle East. Today, Egypt is determined to continue to\r\nassist all parties to overcome the obstacles that impede\r\nnegotiations, and to lay the foundations of new, just and\r\nsecure conditions in the Middle East.\r\nYou may recall that last year, on behalf of my\r\ncountry, I called on the Governments and peoples of the\r\nMiddle East to reflect on the future of our relations after\r\nthe settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. My call was\r\nbased on the deep-seated Egyptian conviction that the only\r\nguarantee of a durable and stable peace in the Middle East\r\nis organically linked to the extent of the parties’ success in\r\nworking out and laying the foundations of a new\r\nrelationship between the countries of the region that would\r\nbe based on a threefold foundation of political settlement,\r\nsocio-economic development, and regional security and\r\narms control.\r\nIn dealing with our vision of a new Middle East, I am\r\ngoing to deal with each of those underpinnings in a context\r\nthat has to do with the creation of a new situation which\r\nwould allow all the creative energies of the region to be\r\nunleashed in a climate of security, stability and confidence\r\nin the future.\r\nI speak first of political settlement. Last year, we met\r\nhere a few days after the signing of the historic agreement\r\nbetween President Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin in\r\nSeptember 1993. Under that agreement, the Israeli and\r\nPalestinian parties mutually recognized each other and\r\nagreed on a Declaration of Principles regarding the\r\narrangements of interim self-government. The wave of\r\noptimism that was generated at the time was tempered by\r\nthe customary caution which lasted until an agreement\r\nenforcing the Declaration of Principles was signed in Cairo\r\non 4 May 1994. That agreement constituted a significant\r\nstep on the long road of peace towards the exercise by the\r\nPalestinian people of their legitimate national rights.\r\nThe sight of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat\r\nentering Gaza on 1 July 1994 has thus epitomized the\r\nlong history of the Palestinian people’s sacrifices and\r\nsteadfastness, with which they gained the support and\r\nsympathy of all peace- and justice-loving peoples\r\neverywhere. President Arafat’s return was the first\r\ndividend of the peace option that heightened international\r\nrespect for the Palestinian people’s responsible position\r\nand courageous decision at this historical and crucial\r\njuncture in their long struggle.\r\nAllow me to pay tribute from this rostrum to the\r\nadvocates of peace, on both the Palestinian and the Israeli\r\nsides. At the same time, I call upon both sides to\r\ncontinue to tend the shoot of peace until it becomes\r\nstronger and more deeply rooted. Moreover, I call for the\r\nexpeditious adoption of new concrete measures that would\r\nassure the Palestinian people in the occupied West Bank\r\nthat the peace dividends will embrace all the Palestinian\r\nterritories occupied since 1967.\r\nOne of the most important of such measures is the\r\nalleviation of the burden of occupation and mitigation of\r\nthe daily suffering of the Palestinian people. The\r\norganization of Palestinian elections in all the Palestinian\r\nterritories would enable them to move from the first step\r\nof self-government in Gaza and Jericho towards the\r\nexercise of their full political rights, in the framework of\r\nself-determination that is the appropriate and genuine\r\nresolution of this conflict. Moreover, I appeal to both\r\nsides, in equally strong terms, to confront all acts of\r\nviolence and practices of terrorism firmly and persistently\r\nto ensure safety for all and guarantee that peace will have\r\nthe upper hand.\r\nEgypt has commended the progress achieved on the\r\nJordanian-Israeli track. The 25 July 1994 agreement to\r\nput an end to the state of war between the two countries\r\nis a positive landmark on the road to peace. Egypt\r\nwelcomes this significant step and is confident that the\r\nrising momentum will soon help achieve tangible progress\r\non the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, based on full\r\nwithdrawal from the occupied territories of both countries.\r\nSecondly, I wish to speak of economic development.\r\nScrutiny of the Middle East situation makes it clear that\r\nthere is an organic link between peace and development\r\nin that region, whose peace and security are pivotal to the\r\nworld’s peace and security. The laying of the\r\ngroundwork for the social and economic development of\r\nthe countries of that region is a necessary step, without\r\nwhich peace will remain meaningless and pointless. At\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nthe same time, the process of development can be\r\nsuccessful only within the context of balanced and well-\r\nplanned strategies that take into account the interests of all\r\nparties. In this regard, hopes are high and prospects are\r\nspacious enough. Nevertheless there is no room in all this\r\nfor the domination by one economy of another. The\r\nMiddle East can accommodate a comprehensive process of\r\nthe production and marketing of all that each country of the\r\nregion can excel in.\r\nEgypt, which is undergoing at present a stage of\r\nradical economic reform that aims at ensuring for its trade,\r\nindustry and private sector a significant breakthrough, is\r\nqualified to play a leading role in the economic\r\ndevelopment of the region. This should enhance the image\r\nof the Middle East as a region that attracts increasing\r\ntourism, flourishing trade and thriving investment, side by\r\nside with an advanced productive capacity. We nominate\r\nthe Middle East to be the cradle of new economic giants.\r\nEgypt does not seek opportunities of rapid gains, but\r\nrather an advanced economic framework that would\r\ncontribute significantly to changing the climate of the\r\nMiddle East and reshaping the region’s ability to contribute\r\nto the interactions of the developed world economy.\r\nThirdly, I speak of regional security and arms control.\r\nComprehensive peace, in its wider sense, will never be\r\nupheld in the Middle East unless we change our old\r\nperceptions. These were the products of years of wars and\r\nenmity that engendered the belief that security could be\r\nassured only through the acquisition and stockpiling of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. This regional arms race, that\r\nplagued the region and accelerated in a climate of mutual\r\nsuspicion and hostility, must be tamed in order that we may\r\nadapt to the new realities prevailing in the region. Egypt\r\nbelieves that peace in the Middle East must be strengthened\r\nby taking arms-control measures, of which the first would\r\nbe a reduction of the levels of armaments.\r\nThe region’s experience has shown that a higher level\r\nof quantitative or qualitative armament, in the case of any\r\ncountry has never deterred aggression nor guaranteed\r\nsecurity. If such experience is reason enough for\r\nreassessing our policies in this respect, the political\r\nachievements which have put us squarely on the road to\r\npeace make us question the wisdom of escalating armament\r\nunder conditions of peace.\r\nIf the first prerequisite is arms reduction, the second\r\nis the achievement of a better security balance amongst the\r\ncountries of the region. The emergence of a new more\r\nstable Middle East will never take place unless we\r\nrenounce the concepts of military superiority and agree to\r\nrid the region of the weapons of mass destruction. The\r\npersistence of such concepts can only jeopardize the\r\nexistent possibility of creating a new and different Middle\r\nEast. Any disruption of the security balance in the\r\nregion, is bound to generate suspicions that may cause the\r\nregion to slide once again into competition, escalation,\r\ndispute, conflict and confrontation.\r\nIf we are seeking normal relations between the\r\nparties, we have to ensure the co-equality of the\r\nobligations of all countries in the region. It is\r\nunacceptable that one party, to the exclusion of all others,\r\nshould be accorded a special exceptional status. Unless\r\nthis is addressed, serious cracks will develop in the\r\nfoundations we are laying which may deepen and widen,\r\nand undermine the whole edifice.\r\nProceeding from this, the Egyptian initiative\r\nlaunched by President Mubarak in April 1990, in which\r\nhe proposed that the Middle East should be declared a\r\nzone free of weapons of mass destruction, was\r\ncommensurate with the concepts of the new international\r\nera at the regional level and came as a natural extension\r\nof Egypt’s 1974 initiative to declare the Middle East a\r\nnuclear-weapons-free zone.\r\nIn this regard, Egypt strongly urges all countries of\r\nthe region to accede to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and accept the\r\napplication of the safeguards regime of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency. This, if it takes place, will be a\r\nmajor step towards peace and reconciliation in the Middle\r\nEast that would safeguard against any setbacks in future\r\nregional relations. Egypt attaches great importance to\r\nIsrael’s rapid undertaking of this step as we approach the\r\ndate of the Conference for the Review and Extension of\r\nthe non-proliferation Treaty in 1995. Otherwise, the\r\nextension of this Treaty, which aims at halting nuclear\r\nproliferation, would lead to the consecration of an adverse\r\nreality that is neither balanced nor proper and which runs\r\ncounter to the principle of universality. We would find\r\nthe persistence of such an exceptional situation strange\r\nand unacceptable.\r\nEgypt takes this opportunity to urge Israel to respond\r\npositively to this extremely earnest call which safeguards\r\nthe region against the evils of an unnecessary arms race.\r\nIt is a step that would help strengthen regional security.\r\nIn this era of peace, we should rethink our priorities and\r\nview the prerequisites of security from a different point\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nof view based on the new relations of peace instead of from\r\nconsiderations which had the upper hand at a time of\r\nregional conflicts. Israel should also conform to, rather\r\nthan depart from, the international way of thinking that\r\ncalls for universal adherence to the non-proliferation Treaty.\r\nWe adamantly insist on this in order to avoid a race in this\r\ndangerous field.\r\nWhile discussing issues of general concern to our world\r\nand its problems, I must also refer specifically to the\r\nprevailing situations in our region that create turbulence,\r\nproblems, hopes and pain. Brotherly Yemen is healing its\r\nwounds after discord and strife. We are hopeful that\r\nsufficient patience will be demonstrated to bring about\r\nnational reconciliation in accordance with the values of the\r\nYemeni people and in such a way as to ensure their\r\ncontinued march towards development and prosperity.\r\nIn Iraq, the brotherly Iraqi people remain in the grip\r\nof the tragedy that befell them and we look forward with\r\nthem to the day when their suffering will come to an end.\r\nThis would require the Government of Iraq to respond to\r\nthe demands of international legality and the unambiguous\r\nand formal recognition of the identity of Kuwait, its\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence.\r\nWhile addressing the issues of the Middle East, we\r\ncall on Iran to extend good-neighbourliness to its Arab\r\nbrethren. In this regard, serious work is needed to resolve\r\nthe problem of the occupied Arab islands in the Gulf. This\r\nwould represent a positive indication that relations in the\r\nregion can be conducted on the basis of a positive dialogue\r\ndealing with the political tendencies that are a source of\r\nconcern in various parts of the region.\r\nI turn now to Egypt’s closest neighbours in the region.\r\nIn this connection, I may say that the people and\r\nGovernment of Libya have now the clear political will to\r\nput an end to the Libyan-Western crisis concerning\r\nLockerbie by putting the accused on trial and attempting to\r\nreach practical solutions for the implementation of the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. An objective view of\r\nthe problem confirms the importance of respecting\r\ninternational legality since the trial of persons accused of an\r\ninternational crime is a necessity and the more\r\nexpeditiously it takes place the better it is for the process of\r\njustice.\r\nSimilarly, in addressing the issues pertaining to its\r\nneighbours, we must also mention Sudan, with which we\r\nhave had very special ties since the dawn of history.\r\nToday, Sudan is suffering from a challenge to its\r\nsovereignty in the south as well as an impediment to the\r\ndevelopment and prosperity of its people. In both\r\ninstances, Egypt stands firmly and clearly in support of\r\nthe unity and territorial integrity of Sudan. We cannot\r\naccept its fragmentation or division. With the same\r\nstrength and clarity, Egypt supports the right of the\r\nSudanese people to a tranquil and stable life that would\r\nafford them the opportunity to look to the future. In this\r\nframework, Sudan has a well-known history of tolerance\r\nand cordial relations amongst its people and with all its\r\nneighbours and brethren. There is no doubt that Sudan’s\r\nimplementation of policies in this direction would ensure\r\na change in the strained relations in that region.\r\nDuring Egypt’s chairmanship of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, which expired in June, the African\r\ncontinent witnessed a number of important achievements,\r\nthe most important of which was the success of the\r\norganization in creating a mechanism for the prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution of African conflicts. This is\r\na development that contributes to the international efforts\r\ndeployed in that area. It also complements the role of the\r\nUnited Nations within the framework of the principles\r\nand objectives of the Charter.\r\nOver the same period, Africa has also witnessed the\r\nentry into force of the convention establishing the African\r\nEconomic Community. This represents a significant step\r\nby the African continent towards the realization of\r\neconomic integration, which will enable it to deal with the\r\nnew international economic realities and to face up to the\r\npotential consequences of international economic\r\ndevelopments that may not be entirely in the interests of\r\nthe African States. Moreover, we in Africa are currently\r\nstudying, in all earnestness, the social and economic\r\nsituation in the continent. We are fully aware of the high\r\npriority of this problem to Africa’s present and future\r\ngenerations. This will be the subject of a special meeting\r\nof African foreign ministers soon to be held in Cairo.\r\nThe African continent’s share of human tragedies\r\nhas been abundant enough, as demonstrated by the\r\nhorrendous events in Somalia, Burundi and Rwanda.\r\nWhile Africa reaffirms its principal responsibility to deal\r\nwith such sorrowful events by providing the necessary\r\ntroops to undertake peace-keeping and peace-building\r\noperations, experience has shown that the humanitarian,\r\npolitical and economic dimensions of such events require\r\na positive contribution by the entire international\r\ncommunity, primarily within the context of the United\r\nNations. Such contribution has been forthcoming and\r\nrepresents a unique international and regional solidarity.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nAs regards Somalia, the tragedy is still unfolding,\r\ndespite strenuous African and international efforts to\r\nachieve national reconciliation between the warring Somali\r\nfactions. The crisis remains elusive owing to tribal rivalries\r\nand self-centered interests. The persistence of this situation\r\nhas further frustrated the international community, to the\r\nextent that a number of States have decided to withdraw\r\ntheir troops from the peace-keeping operation or to call for\r\nthe complete termination of the United Nations Operation\r\nin Somalia.\r\nWe are fully aware of the motives that have led to\r\nsuch decisions and proposals, and we emphasize that the\r\nresponsibility for putting an end to the current deteriorating\r\nsituation in Somalia and for reaching a solution to the crisis\r\nrests essentially with the leaders of the warring factions.\r\nWe are of the view that it is unacceptable and unwarranted\r\nthat the major Powers should impose a certain solution or\r\na particular leader in Somalia. At the same\r\ntime, we cannot wash our hands of this problem. There is\r\nstill an obligation on the part of the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the League of Arab\r\nStates to assist in achieving a just settlement to the crisis.\r\nFrom Somalia we turn to Angola, in which recent\r\ndevelopments indicate a glimmer of hope that a final and\r\npeaceful solution may be close at hand. Egypt welcomes\r\nthe official acceptance by the Government of Angola of the\r\nproposals concerning national reconciliation. We call for\r\nthe intensification of efforts to achieve peace in order that\r\nthe Lusaka Conference may succeed and for the full\r\nimplementation of the peace agreement, as well as Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 864 (1993) and 932 (1994). We also\r\nstrongly urge UNITA to show its goodwill by negotiating\r\nconstructively to reach a peace agreement without delay.\r\nIt was our hope that a just solution to the Bosnian\r\ncrisis would be found before the commencement of this\r\nsession. Unfortunately, the painful reality is that the crisis\r\nis still with us. While we accept the position of the\r\nContact Group in its proposal of the peace plan which has\r\nbeen accepted by the Bosnian Government regardless of its\r\nshortcomings, yet we demand the most basic level of\r\nrationality and justice in managing this crisis. Frankly\r\nspeaking, we believe that lifting or easing the sanctions\r\nimposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - Serbia\r\nand Montenegro - without deploying credible and capable\r\ninternational observers along its borders with Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina or securing its recognition of Bosnia as a\r\nsovereign State amounts to a negative development that is\r\nbound to hinder a just settlement, that bespeaks\r\nacquiescence in considerations that run counter to the norms\r\nof justice and is tantamount to surrender to the policies of\r\naggression and racism.\r\nA few days ago, the Security Council adopted a\r\nrather hasty resolution easing the sanctions imposed on\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - Serbia and\r\nMontenegro. It would have been more useful if the\r\nCouncil had given priority to a review of the extent of the\r\nimplementation of its many previous resolutions, adopted\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter. Those resolutions\r\ncontain provisions and requirements that should have been\r\nimplemented prior to any consideration of the easing or\r\nreviewing of sanctions.\r\nThe rules of international justice should not be\r\ntwisted to reward the aggressor for mere promises that\r\nlack credibility or effectiveness. Moreover, the\r\neffectiveness of the observers currently deployed on the\r\nBosnian-Yugoslav border is highly questionable. Indeed,\r\nin our view, they are ineffective and insufficient.\r\nEgypt, as a country contributing troops to the United\r\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), reiterates that\r\nthe purpose of the presence of these troops is to provide\r\ngenuine protection for those areas until such time as the\r\nBosnian armed forces would be in a position to undertake\r\nthe task of defending their territory.\r\nThe withdrawal of UNPROFOR while the power\r\nvacuum continues - an idea that is being floated - would\r\nbe a further step towards handing the protected areas to\r\nthe aggressors, who have the necessary power to control\r\nthem. This would certainly have negative implications for\r\ninternational relations as a whole.\r\nWe are at a unique juncture in history: our\r\ngeneration has been afforded an opportunity to lay the\r\nfoundations of a new era. Today, as we approach the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we feel that all\r\nnations, industrial and developing alike, must contribute\r\nto the development of a common vision of the new world\r\norder - a vision that will consolidate the foundations of\r\nour common future on the principles of democracy,\r\nhumanity and equality, arrived at through consensus by all\r\nmembers of the international community.\r\nWe wish to make it clear that any attempt to\r\nmarginalize the role of the developing countries in\r\nformulating the global vision for the coming era would\r\ninvolve the risk of drawing new lines of confrontation in\r\nplace of those that existed during the cold war. Those\r\nnew lines of confrontation would be ruled by economic\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nand developmental criteria and considerations that may ring\r\ndown a curtain thick enough to separate the North from the\r\nSouth, deepen disagreement between them, and give rise to\r\na situation inconsistent with the interdependence and\r\ncohesion of the present era. In this connection, I refer to\r\ndemands of the developing countries voiced during the\r\nmeeting held in Cairo this summer under the umbrella of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations coincides with the flagging of initiatives and\r\nproposals for the restructuring of the Organization’s\r\nmechanisms. Such efforts will never rise to the level of\r\nexpectations unless they are preceded by an effort to reform\r\nour thinking, to bring it into line with the changes in the\r\ninternational situation and thereby to translate the new\r\ncollective vision into a concrete programme of action that\r\nwould be based on genuine consensus and that would afford\r\nus a real opportunity to ensure the stability of international\r\nrelations.\r\nIn this context, it is needless to point out that such a\r\nprocess of thought reform as the one I have just referred to\r\nmust impact on our efforts as we embark on the process of\r\nrestructuring the United Nations and, in particular, of\r\nreforming the Security Council with its extensive\r\ncompetence.\r\nWe must emphasize several points regarding the\r\nprocess of reforming the work of the Security Council.\r\nFirst, it must be carried out on a regional basis, not on a\r\nspecific-country basis. Secondly, the new seats - and there\r\nmay be two additional ones each for Latin America, Asia\r\nand Africa - must be allocated on the basis of the criteria\r\nstipulated in the Charter. Thirdly, it is not essential at this\r\nstage to specify the two States from each region that are to\r\noccupy the additional seats. The principle of rotation could\r\nbe applied to several States satisfying the criteria agreed\r\nupon, taking into account the specific characteristics of each\r\nregion. Fourthly, agreement must be reached\r\nsimultaneously on a number of issues concerning reform of\r\nthe Council’s working methods and procedures and the\r\nneed to increase its transparency. Fifthly, the framework\r\nwithin which the right of veto is used should be reviewed\r\nand defined.\r\nWe should not pursue our work in this regard under\r\npressure of time or on the assumption that consideration of\r\nthe matter must be concluded by the time designated for the\r\ncelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nFinally, it must be emphasized that rational\r\nrestructuring is infinitely preferable to what might result\r\nfrom a hasty decision that may please some States, upset\r\nthe overwhelming majority of States that suffer from lack\r\nof representation in the Security Council and put the\r\nCouncil itself in a position of extreme lack of credibility.\r\nIn this regard, I wish to state that a number of\r\ncountries are eligible for membership of the Security\r\nCouncil in accordance with the criteria to which I have\r\nreferred. One of those countries is Egypt, which has\r\nmade significant contributions to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security in all the political,\r\neconomic and social fields, and which continues to\r\ncontribute to the cause of peace and prosperity at the\r\nregional level and in the context of its various affiliations.\r\nEconomic clout has become the principal tool of\r\ncompetition and the determining factor in the distribution\r\nof power and influence on the political and economic map\r\nof the globe. At the same time, social development has\r\nbecome a goal which we all pursue and technological\r\ndevelopment has become a prerequisite of economic\r\nprogress and social advancement. It is a challenge that\r\nmust be faced by those who aspire to progress and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nRecent international developments have highlighted\r\nthe strong link between peace, stability and development.\r\nGlobal stability cannot be achieved without balanced and\r\nsustainable development. The existing structural\r\nimbalances in international economic relations will\r\ncontinue to cause the social turmoil and conflicts that turn\r\nunder our eyes to disputes which threaten international\r\npeace and security.\r\nMr. Ben Yahia (Tunisia), Vice-President, took the\r\nchair.\r\nOn its new journey - starting in New York, moving\r\non to Rio de Janeiro and Vienna, passing through Cairo\r\nto be continued in Copenhagen and Beijing - the United\r\nNations has proved that it remains the global umbrella\r\nunder which different ideas and positions interact.\r\nWe call on the United Nations not only to contribute\r\nto but to lead the process of formulating the new concepts\r\nand ideas required to lay the foundations of the new\r\ninternational order and the relations between the North\r\nand the South, particularly in the area of social\r\ndevelopment. This requires an overall process of\r\nrationalization, as indicated by the Secretary-General. In\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nhis current report on the work of the Organization he refers\r\nto\r\n\"the common misperception of the United Nations as\r\nan organization dedicated primarily to peace-keeping.\"\r\n(A/49/1, para. 1)\r\nHe states that economic and social questions should be at\r\nthe forefront of United Nations efforts. That is what should\r\nhappen.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mümtaz Soysal.\r\nMr. Soysal (Turkey): Allow me to congratulate the\r\nPresident on his election to his high office, and to thank the\r\noutgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally,\r\nfor his wise leadership during the forty-eighth session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMany had hoped that the fall of the Berlin Wall would\r\nput an end to the divisions of the world and usher in a new\r\nera of peace and harmony among nations. This has not\r\nhappened. Today humanity faces a new division or\r\nfragmentation far more dramatic in essence. The world is\r\ntorn between hope and despair. This is the new division\r\nwe are facing.\r\nOn the one hand, hope: the spirit of democracy is\r\nkept alive. The global commitment to the universal\r\nprinciples of respect for human rights, the rule of law and\r\nfundamental freedoms has been maintained.\r\nOn the other hand, despair: the eruption of\r\nlong-suppressed evil forces, such as ethnic and xenophobic\r\nnationalism, racism and tribalism, has caused new conflicts.\r\nThey have emerged as new threats to international peace\r\nand security.\r\nOn the darkest side, there are new instances of\r\ngenocide. Slogans of racial hatred have resurfaced.\r\nHundreds of thousands of people have been killed or\r\nwounded; hundreds of thousands of people have become\r\nrefugees or displaced persons. Human dignity has been\r\nviolated.\r\nOn the brightest side, historic breakthroughs have been\r\nachieved in South Africa and the Middle East. The\r\ncourageous stand of some eminent statesmen has been\r\ninstrumental in translating the basic vision of the United\r\nNations into reality. In this respect, our praise goes to the\r\nleaders of Palestine, Israel and South Africa for their\r\ncourage and far-sightedness. Their bold steps towards\r\npeace fostered our optimism to counter the negative\r\ntrends.\r\nIn order to be able to plan a better future, we must\r\ntake account of the achievements and the failures of the\r\npast and meet the challenges of the present. The time has\r\ncome to start to contemplate realistically how to create\r\nnew and workable mechanisms to respond effectively to\r\nthe challenges of our times. But we first have to accept\r\nthe fact that euphoria is almost always short-lived.\r\nToday we observe two contradictory trends, one\r\ntowards fragmentation and conflict and the other towards\r\nglobalization and cooperation. This new dialectic defines\r\nthe framework within which we have to work together to\r\nfind a balance between optimism and pessimism, between\r\nthe integrity of the nation-State and the demands of an\r\never more interdependent world.\r\nThis Organization was built on the ashes of the\r\nSecond World War. The war’s aftermath left its imprint\r\nnot only on the United Nations Charter, but also on the\r\nrules that govern its work and its structure. Hence, the\r\ncrucial challenge before us today is to make the United\r\nNations the real centre of universal solidarity, by\r\nimproving its effectiveness and harmonizing its work with\r\nthese new imperatives. It is in line with this reasoning\r\nthat we attach the utmost importance to the process of\r\nreform and restructuring of the United Nations.\r\nIn this exercise, the pivotal point should be the\r\nSecurity Council. The widespread demands to make that\r\nprincipal body more representative, more responsive,\r\nmore transparent and more accountable have imposed\r\nupon us a historic task which we must fulfil. The\r\ndemocratization of the Security Council is a challenge of\r\nour times, one that requires an adequate response. The\r\nmoral authority of this body needs to be reinforced. We\r\nhave to enhance the representative weight of the Security\r\nCouncil by enlarging it and by establishing a fairer and\r\nmore orderly system of rotation within the geographical\r\ngroups.\r\nWe must make sure that the Security Council is not\r\nperceived as a tool of a small group of big States that\r\nseek to impose their will and their national policy\r\nobjectives on others. Indeed, the moral and legal\r\nauthority of the Security Council’s decisions emanates\r\nfrom the fact that the Council, in accordance with Article\r\n24 of the Charter, acts on behalf of all States Members of\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nthe United Nations. Consequently, it is essential that the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council be reviewed to\r\nreflect the spirit of democratization.\r\nWith this understanding, my country, Turkey, has been\r\nactively participating in the deliberations of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. We expect this Working Group to\r\nbecome a genuine driving force for real reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. Therefore, any \"quick-fix\" solution in\r\nwhich the reform may be interpreted in a rather narrow\r\nsense cannot be accepted. In the same vein, we also fully\r\nsupport the efforts under way to revitalize and rationalize\r\nthe work of the General Assembly as the central and\r\nuniversal deliberative forum.\r\nThe ongoing conflicts and tragedies all over the world\r\nunderscore the urgency of our task of strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly in the field of collective\r\nsecurity. In the past five years, United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations have undergone considerable\r\nexpansion. The nature of peace-keeping is changing.\r\nPreventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-enforcement,\r\npeace-building and global human security have emerged as\r\nnew concepts on which further reflection is needed.\r\nAs an active participant in the peace-keeping\r\noperations of the United Nations, Turkey believes that their\r\nsuccess depends ultimately on the support and assistance\r\nreceived from the community of nations. This, in turn,\r\nrequires the awareness of a sense of shared responsibility\r\nin addressing our common concerns.\r\nThe United Nations stand-by forces, in which we have\r\ndecided to participate, would play an essential role in\r\npromoting such awareness. Only when a potential\r\naggressor clearly perceives that the international community\r\nwill retaliate in a timely and effective manner might it\r\nchange its behaviour.\r\nThe challenges we are facing today go beyond the\r\nmeans and resources of a single organization. Accordingly,\r\nthere is a need for a new collective security architecture of\r\nmutually-reinforcing institutions in which all elements\r\nwould have a role to play. The interaction between global\r\nsecurity and regional security requires effective cooperation\r\nand coordination among the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations. One thing is clear: only the United Nations\r\ncan provide legitimacy to regional arrangements and\r\ninstitutions in the fields of peace-keeping and peacemaking.\r\nFrom Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Caucasus to\r\nRwanda, the peoples of the world, faced with threats of\r\nracist hatred, are desperately demanding the helping hand\r\nand protection of the United Nations.\r\nRegrettably, the tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nhas continued to be at the top of the international agenda\r\nduring the past 12 months. Despite numerous Security\r\nCouncil and General Assembly resolutions, the\r\ninternational community has been able neither to put an\r\nend to the ethnic cleansing, nor to roll back the brutal\r\naggression against the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. On the contrary, the lack of effective\r\nenforcement measures has encouraged the aggressors to\r\nproceed further with their genocidal campaign and their\r\nblatant defiance of international law.\r\nDecisive and firm action to stop the aggression is\r\nlong overdue. The Washington and Vienna Agreements\r\nlaid down the foundation for a just and viable peace in\r\nBosnia. These Agreements define the framework of a\r\nfederation which preserves the territorial integrity and\r\nunity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a multicultural,\r\nmultireligious and multi-ethnic State. They are also open\r\nto the participation of Bosnian Serbs.\r\nThe Bosnian Government accepted the latest\r\ninternational peace plan proposed by the five-nation\r\nContact Group in the spirit of peace. However, the\r\nextremist Serbs, longing for an ethnically homogeneous\r\nGreater Serbia, have insisted on their defiance of the will\r\nof the international community and have rejected the\r\npeace plan. Their rejection has demonstrated, yet again,\r\nthat aggression cannot be halted on the shifting sands of\r\npromises and declarations.\r\nThe five-nation Contact Group has committed itself,\r\nin case of rejection, to the tightening of sanctions on\r\nSerbia and Montenegro. We deeply regret that the\r\nSecurity Council, by adopting resolution 943 (1994) on\r\n23 September 1994, moved in the opposite direction\r\ndespite the efforts of the Contact Group of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. Once again,\r\naggression has been rewarded. Genocide remains\r\nunchecked. The Bosnian people are yet again completely\r\ndisappointed with the international system. Their\r\ndisappointment is shared more and more by the rest of the\r\nworld, especially in the Islamic countries.\r\nWe have arrived at a critical juncture. The\r\ninternational community should stand by its commitments\r\nand should begin to act resolutely. We have to admit\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nthat only diplomacy backed by sufficient force can make\r\nthe extremist Serbs realize that war gives them more pain\r\nthan gain. There should be no further easing of the\r\nsanctions until Serbia and Montenegro recognize all the\r\nsuccessor States within their international borders.\r\nAs winter approaches, the need to provide security,\r\nshelter and humanitarian assistance to the civilian\r\npopulation becomes ever more pressing. The safe areas\r\nshould be extended and effectively protected by the United\r\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The strangulation\r\nof Sarajevo should be ended. The humanitarian corridors\r\nshould remain open.\r\nAs a matter of principle, the Bosnian Government\r\nmust be provided with all the means necessary for\r\nself-defence, so that it may exercise its inherent right under\r\nArticle 51 of the Charter. This is a moral, legal and\r\npolitical obligation on the part of the international\r\ncommunity - but primarily a moral one.\r\nPresident Izetbegović, in his address at the 7th plenary\r\nmeeting, on 27 September 1994, from this rostrum,\r\nannounced a new formula in this respect. On the condition\r\nthat certain conditions be fulfilled, he limited his just\r\ndemand for the lifting of the arms embargo to the adoption\r\nof a formal decision, deferring the implementation of the\r\ndecision for six months. This is a new sacrifice motivated\r\nby the international community’s inability to provide\r\nsecurity for the victims or to recognize their basic right to\r\nself-defence. We must praise this noble gesture and\r\nsupport the new formula.\r\nRealization of the commitments to a just and viable\r\npeace in Bosnia - commitments that have so far remained\r\nunfulfilled - is vital for the restoration of the credibility and\r\nmoral authority of the United Nations. If we fail the test of\r\nhistory in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the so-called \"new\r\nworld order\" could turn into a permanent \"new world\r\ndisorder\".\r\nWe are witnessing further potential threats to the peace\r\nand stability of the Balkans. With the increasing tension\r\nbetween Greece and Albania there is, regrettably, a risk that\r\nyet another crisis may be created in the region. In addition,\r\nthe Republic of Macedonia is suffering from an illegal\r\neconomic blockade imposed by Greece. Moreover,\r\nMacedonia is still waiting to be represented at the United\r\nNations under the name and the flag it has chosen.\r\nThe Balkans can in no way stand the pressure of\r\nadditional tensions. Compliance with the basic international\r\nnorms - respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,\r\nnon-intervention in internal affairs, and the need to\r\nresolve disputes by peaceful means rather than by threat\r\nor coercion - is today more than ever before a pressing\r\nneed in the Balkans.\r\nMy country lies at the very epicentre of the vast\r\ngeography and the new geopolitics of Eurasia. Most of\r\nthe conflicts which are high on the international agenda\r\nare taking place around Turkey. Fully aware of our\r\nresponsibilities for the peace and stability of our region\r\nand beyond, we are trying to contain conflicts.\r\nWe seek to reverse destabilizing currents. We strive\r\nto promote the rule of law and democracy on our\r\nperiphery. We remain a factor for stability. We believe\r\nthat regional economic cooperation is a driving force for\r\nshared prosperity and increased confidence among nations\r\nas well as the most effective way to prevent the spread of\r\nethnic conflicts and potential hegemonic tendencies.\r\nWith this awareness, we have developed new\r\ncreative and cooperative regional initiatives to enhance\r\nsolidarity and to consolidate the new geopolitical\r\npluralism. We have established the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation with Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria,\r\nGeorgia, Greece, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the\r\nRussian Federation and Ukraine. The Economic\r\nCooperation Organization, originally founded by Turkey,\r\nIran and Pakistan, has been enlarged to include\r\nAfghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,\r\nTajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\r\nAnother blatant example of defiance of international\r\nlaw has been unfolding in the Caucasus, where Armenian\r\nforces continue to occupy one-fifth of Azerbaijani\r\nterritory. More than a million Azerbaijanis have been\r\ndisplaced. Constant calls by the international community\r\nfor the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of\r\noccupying forces, as stipulated in relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, have fallen on deaf ears. This\r\nunlawful situation, created by Armenians, constitutes a\r\nserious threat not only to the stability of the region\r\nneighbouring Turkey, but also to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nAs a member of the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) Minsk Group since its\r\ninception, Turkey remains committed to the CSCE peace\r\nprocess. We firmly believe that a solution should be\r\nfound through collective efforts under the authority of the\r\nCSCE. In this respect, we fully support the endeavours\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nof the Chairman of the Minsk Group to organize a\r\nmultinational force to assist the parties to reach a just and\r\nlasting solution. We stand ready to contribute to these\r\nendeavours.\r\nIn this context, I should like to reiterate our consistent\r\nand firm position, which we have expressed from this\r\nrostrum on many occasions: Neither in the Balkans nor in\r\nthe Caucasus, nor, for that matter, anywhere else, will\r\nTurkey ever accept the acquisition of territory by force.\r\nNor will Turkey ever allow misinformation and unashamed\r\nofficial propaganda - even from this rostrum - to continue\r\nto lead the international community to tolerate and\r\nperpetuate the living conditions imposed upon the Turkish\r\npeople of Cyprus.\r\nTurkish Cypriots remain totally isolated in their part\r\nof the island because of innumerable restrictions that\r\nGovernments and international organizations have placed on\r\ntheir trade, travel, cultural and sporting contacts with the\r\nrest of the world. This arbitrary embargo is maintained as\r\na result of a relentless campaign to distort the facts relating\r\nto the history of events on the island over the last 31 years.\r\nEven a United Nations-sponsored confidence-building\r\npackage, which was aimed at partially alleviating the ill\r\neffects of this embargo, was deliberately torpedoed by the\r\nshort-sighted policies of the other side, and, unfortunately,\r\nprospects for a just and durable settlement have been\r\nfurther eroded.\r\nA realistic and viable negotiated settlement continues\r\nto be the objective of the Turkish Cypriot side. We support\r\nthis, and we believe that the only way towards a\r\ncomprehensive solution of the question of Cyprus lies in\r\nremoving the obstacles to the confidence-building measures.\r\nAs a neighbouring country, Turkey follows very\r\nclosely developments in Georgia. We look forward to the\r\nrestoration of peaceful conditions in that friendly country\r\nand stand prepared to participate in the concerted\r\ninternational action within the framework of the United\r\nNations Observer Mission in Georgia.\r\nTurkey has set out on a lasting path of solidarity with\r\nthe newly independent Central Asian republics, with which\r\nit has historic, cultural and linguistic ties. Turkey fully\r\nsupports the efforts of those secular republics to build\r\npluralistic societies and will assist them in integrating into\r\nthe world community. I should like to underscore that\r\nTurkey’s relationship between sovereign countries is one of\r\ncooperation and solidarity; it is a relationship between\r\nsovereign countries. It is neither in competition with, nor\r\nexclusive of, other countries’ relations with them.\r\nWe attach great importance to the unity and\r\nterritorial integrity of Afghanistan. We had hoped that a\r\nbroad-based national reconciliation process including all\r\ngroups could have started. However, we have been\r\ngreatly dismayed by the resumption of armed conflict.\r\nWe once again call upon all the Afghan parties to put an\r\nend to the fratricidal fighting and start working for the\r\nestablishment of internal peace so that the rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction of this devastated country can begin.\r\nIn the Middle East, the end of the cold war has\r\nfundamentally altered the bleak picture and opened new\r\nhorizons for peace. The Israeli-Palestinian agreement and\r\nthe ensuing Israeli-Jordanian agreements have opened up\r\na new era in which enmity is giving way to reconciliation\r\nand despair to hope.\r\nThe historic breakthrough in the peace process,\r\nwhich promises concord and cooperation between the\r\nPalestinians and Israel, and between Israel and its Arab\r\nneighbours, will undoubtedly have positive ramifications\r\non a much wider regional and global scale. The\r\nestablishment of permanent peace in the Middle East will\r\nalso create the necessary conditions for harmony,\r\neconomic cooperation and shared prosperity.\r\nAs a country neighbouring the Middle East, Turkey\r\nhas a record of constructive involvement in the region’s\r\naffairs and good traditional ties with all the parties. It is\r\nactively participating in all tracks of multilateral\r\nnegotiations. It remains ready to contribute to the\r\neconomic restructuring efforts of the Palestinians in Gaza\r\nand Jericho. It will take part in the temporary\r\ninternational presence upon the request of the parties. I\r\nshould like to reaffirm our strong support for the process\r\ntowards a just and lasting peace in the region.\r\nThe rather optimistic prospects for the future of the\r\nMiddle East need to be tempered, however, with a degree\r\nof realism, in the face of the hardship the Iraqi people\r\nhave been suffering. Four years after the outbreak of the\r\nGulf crisis they are still waiting to return to normality.\r\nWe are fully aware of the fact that, in order to take its\r\nrightful place in the international community, Iraq has to\r\ncomply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nHowever, we cannot and should not turn a blind eye to\r\nthe fact that Iraq has almost completed its compliance\r\nwith the disarmament requirements under Security\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nCouncil resolution 687 (1991) and deserves encouragement\r\nin this respect.\r\nIt should also be borne in mind that the sanctions have\r\ncaused great economic problems not only for the Iraqi\r\npeople but also for a number of countries, especially Iraq’s\r\nneighbours. The great economic losses of the most\r\nadversely affected countries, particularly mine - Turkey -\r\nstill have to be addressed.\r\nHere, I must also underline once again our principled\r\nstand that we will remain committed to the territorial\r\nintegrity and unity of Iraq, which are vital for peace and\r\nstability in the Middle East.\r\nThe elimination of apartheid in South Africa closed a\r\nlong and dark chapter in the history of humanity. Apart\r\nfrom South Africa, the picture is still gloomy in many parts\r\nof Africa. The United Nations conducts half of its\r\npeace-keeping operations in that continent and is actively\r\ninvolved in maintaining and building peace in Somalia,\r\nMozambique, Angola, Liberia, Rwanda and Burundi.\r\nThe efforts of the United Nations in Africa should be\r\nbased on a twofold and consolidated strategy. They should\r\nbe directed not only to maintaining peace, but also to\r\naccelerating sustained economic development, through\r\nwhich the major causes of continued armed conflicts may\r\nbe defused.\r\nIndeed, the root causes of conflict require new global\r\ncommitments. In full agreement with the\r\nSecretary-General, my Government subscribes to the view\r\nthat it is time to balance the old commitment to territorial\r\nsecurity with a new commitment to human security; to shift\r\nfrom providing security through arms to ensuring security\r\nthrough development.\r\nThe end of the cold war has also ended the\r\ncompartmentalization of major components, such as\r\npolitical security and social issues. It is now mostly\r\nrecognized that security cannot be viewed in political and\r\nmilitary terms alone, and that peace and prosperity are\r\nindivisible.\r\nAt a time when disorder and disintegration, both at\r\nnational and international levels, seem fated to increase, the\r\nconcept of crisis prevention needs to be elaborated and\r\nexpanded.\r\nWe strongly endorse the view that peace, development\r\nand democracy are interrelated and mutually reinforcing.\r\nWe all recognize the pressing need to promote a new\r\nculture of development. The United Nations new agenda\r\nfor development must bring sustainable and\r\npeople-centred development to the forefront. For this, a\r\nstronger role for the United Nations is needed.\r\nDemocracy is the underlying imperative for human\r\nsecurity, social integration and good governance. Indeed,\r\nduring the Vienna Conference last year, the international\r\ncommunity reiterated its commitment to the protection of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms and to the\r\ncommon struggle against racism, xenophobia and\r\nintolerance. Today a pluralistic civil society, free and fair\r\nelections, and the rule of law are defined as the common\r\ngoals of humanity. Dialogue between different cultures\r\ncan only be achieved within the context of democracy.\r\nViolence and terrorism could not, and should not, be\r\njustified under any circumstances. In this spirit, the\r\nGeneral Assembly in its resolution 48/122 reaffirmed the\r\nVienna Declaration and described terrorism as an activity\r\nwhich aims at the destruction of human rights,\r\nfundamental freedoms and democracy, as well as\r\nthreatening the territorial integrity and security of States,\r\ndestabilizing legitimately constituted Governments,\r\nundermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse\r\nconsequences on the economic and social development of\r\nStates. We call upon the international community to\r\nstand by its commitments and to take the necessary steps\r\nto combat and eradicate terrorism.\r\nLack of tolerance is the underlying cause of various\r\nconflicts which constitute the most important threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. Therefore, promotion of\r\na culture of tolerance has a direct bearing on crisis\r\nprevention. We should inject the spirit of tolerance into\r\nthe young generations.\r\nIt is a pleasure for me to recall here that on Turkey’s\r\ninitiative, the General Assembly last December\r\nproclaimed 1995 as the United Nations Year for\r\nTolerance. By the terms of resolution 48/126, the entire\r\nUnited Nations system has been asked to contribute to its\r\nsuccessful observance. Its celebration will contribute to\r\nthe acceleration of efforts to prevent all forms of racism,\r\ndiscrimination, fanaticism and fundamentalism.\r\nDisarmament should also be seen within the context\r\nof preventive diplomacy. We must recognize the fact that\r\nthe end of the cold war has not removed the danger of\r\nnuclear weapons. On the contrary, in some cases the\r\ndanger has actually increased. Hence, another field where\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nprogress is needed is the prevention of nuclear proliferation.\r\nAs we prepare for the Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which\r\nwill be convened next year, the creation of a climate of\r\nconfidence will be vital. Measures need to be taken now\r\nto create that climate.\r\nIn the same vein, we hold the view that full\r\ncompliance with existing arms control and disarmament\r\ninstruments at regional and global levels is of primary\r\nimportance.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has rightly stated, the\r\nchildren’s Summit in 1990, the Earth Summit in 1992, the\r\nhuman rights Conference in 1993, the population\r\nConference in September 1994, the social development\r\nSummit in March 1995 and the women’s Conference to be\r\nheld in September 1995 are all linked. By 1995, in time\r\nfor the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we should\r\nreach a global consensus on the way forward to new\r\ncommitments towards building a better world.\r\nTo complete the agenda, we must also add to these\r\nmajor events the Second United Nations Conference on\r\nHuman Settlements (Habitat II), which will be held in\r\nJune 1996 in Istanbul. In this context, we welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s call to declare the Habitat II\r\nConference as the \"City Summit\" to increase world\r\nawareness on this subject and to commit the world’s\r\nleaders to making our cities, towns and villages healthy,\r\nsafe, just and sustainable. High-level participation in this\r\nConference will ensure its success.\r\nWe will commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization next year. It is the most opportune time, on\r\nthe threshold of a new millennium, to take stock of what\r\nwe have achieved, and where we have failed, with a sense\r\nof realism and vision. We are obliged to realize the\r\ndreams of the founders of the United Nations. We hope\r\nthat our deliberations will help to generate a new impetus\r\nfor positive action to this end.\r\nMember States have set their hopes on the United\r\nNations, which reflects diversity united in a common\r\ncause. To the extent that it succeeds, we will have a\r\nbetter world for all peoples, and peace, security,\r\ndemocracy, development and prosperity will be enhanced.\r\nThis requires cooperative action, which all nations\r\nshould be engaged in. We have to give full scope to our\r\nimagination to keep pace with the winds of change and\r\nstrive for the realization of the shared dreams of\r\nhumankind. If we fail, future generations will pay dearly\r\nfor our mistakes. I am convinced that after all the bitter\r\nexperiences of the past, humanity has the cumulative\r\nwisdom not to make such mistakes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\n28\r\n"
