(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, Head of State\r\nand Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic\r\nof Tajikistan\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Head of State\r\nand Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of\r\nTajikistan.\r\nMr. Emomali Rakhmonov, Head of State and\r\nChairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of\r\nTajikistan, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the Head of State and\r\nChairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of\r\nTajikistan, His Excellency Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, and\r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nChairman Rakhmonov (interpretation from Russian):\r\nSpeaking from this high rostrum of the United Nations, I\r\nwould like first of all to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the high office of the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly. I am convinced that, having received such a\r\nhigh honour, you will be successful in your conduct of this\r\nforum that is so important in the life of the world\r\ncommunity.\r\nReflecting on the past, we can state with satisfaction\r\nthat the United Nations, by traversing the difficult road\r\nof overcoming political and ideological confrontation, has\r\nsaved humanity from a new global catastrophe. Today\r\nwe can say with confidence that the United Nations is a\r\nuniversally recognized instrument of peace and\r\nconstruction.\r\nWe commend the United Nations peace-keeping and\r\nhumanitarian efforts in Tajikistan. I consider it my duty\r\nto convey the sincere thanks of the Tajik people to the\r\nUnited Nations, the donor countries, the international\r\norganizations - in short, to everyone who is doing\r\neverything possible to help our State in these hard times.\r\nThere is no need to describe in detail all the\r\nhardship that has befallen our long-suffering motherland.\r\nThe wounds of the civil war, that serious illness of our\r\nsociety, cannot be healed either by surgical intervention\r\nor by compulsory treatment. They are healed only when\r\nthe victim himself becomes aware of his affliction and\r\nmakes the most effective use of all possible means\r\nnecessary for recovery.\r\nTo the credit of the people of my country, it should\r\nbe said that they were able to put an end to bloodshed,\r\nlawlessness and terror and start a constructive life.\r\nExperiencing a severe lack of time and an extremely\r\nheavy burden of political, social and economic problems,\r\nwe were able to consolidate a tendency towards the\r\nstabilization of the situation in our country. Today we can\r\nstate with confidence that the situation differs radically\r\nfrom that prevailing at the beginning of last year.\r\n1\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nRecognizing its responsibility for the destiny of the\r\ncountry, the Government of Tajikistan firmly declared its\r\ncommitment to values common to all humanity and its\r\nresolve to start building a democratic and secular State\r\nbased on the rule of law. In order to realize these\r\nintentions we have launched the constitutional process in\r\nour country.\r\nIn the course of drafting the Constitution we were\r\nguided by the experience of countries with established\r\ndemocratic traditions and advice given by highly qualified\r\nexperts of the United Nations and the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). We sought to\r\ntake into consideration the high standards set up in the\r\nbasic documents of the Helsinki process so that the new\r\nConstitution would ensure to the fullest extent possible the\r\nprotection of inalienable human rights.\r\nWe intend to conduct a referendum so the whole\r\npopulation can decide on the adoption of the new\r\nConstitution, the results of which will reinforce hope for\r\nachieving further progress in the development of society\r\nand the State. The proposed draft Constitution will provide\r\na legal basis for subsequent democratic transformations and\r\nreforms. It will undoubtedly accelerate them and make\r\nthem irreversible. Furthermore, the President of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, elected by the whole population,\r\nwill enforce the Constitution and guarantee the State’s unity\r\nand integrity.\r\nIn our domestic policy the principal issues for our\r\ncountry’s political leaders have become the questions of our\r\nnation’s spiritual revival, of the halting of senseless\r\nconfrontation and of the creation of a social basis for\r\nmutual understanding and forgiveness. The solution of\r\nthese problems will help achieve maximum progress\r\ntowards national reconciliation.\r\nLet me describe briefly to the Assembly our view of\r\nthe problem. Addressing the General Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session, I stated that political dialogue was the only\r\npossible way of untying the internal Tajik knot and\r\nachieving national reconciliation and that it was one of our\r\nhighest priorities. A careful study of the state of society,\r\nand of public opinion in particular, gave us the idea of\r\nentering into dialogue with those who have never concealed\r\ntheir desire to seize power by force. In doing so we used\r\nall possible means, including regional and international\r\nmechanisms. Only the good will demonstrated by the\r\nleaders of Tajikistan made it possible to start and to\r\ndevelop the negotiating process.\r\nThe importance of the initiatives put forward by the\r\nSecretary-General, the decisions of the Security Council\r\nand the assistance of the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe in accelerating the national\r\nreconciliation process should be particularly emphasized.\r\nWe deeply appreciate the unwavering attention of\r\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali to all the problems of Tajikistan, and we\r\ntake this opportunity to express to him our sincere\r\ngratitude.\r\nWe appreciate no less deeply the activities of the\r\nSecretary-General’s Special Envoy to Tajikistan, Mr.\r\nRamiro Piriz-Ballon, of the United Nations Observers in\r\nTajikistan and of the CSCE mission. All of them have\r\nmade a valuable contribution to the elaboration of the\r\nnegotiating mechanisms.\r\nI would like to note with satisfaction the hopeful\r\nresults of the political consultations between us and the\r\nTajik opposition, with the mediation of Mr. Ramiro\r\nPiriz-Ballon, which took place in Tehran in the second\r\nhalf of September 1994. The parties signed the\r\nAgreement on a cease-fire and stopping hostile actions,\r\nand we consider this to be an important step towards the\r\nachievement of national reconciliation, peace and stability\r\nin Tajikistan. The Security Council and the international\r\ncommunity noted with satisfaction the signing of that\r\ndocument. From this rostrum I would like to express the\r\nhope that the question of dispatching United Nations\r\nmilitary observers to Tajikistan will be resolved without\r\ndelay.\r\nI express our gratitude to the Governments and the\r\npeoples of the Russian Federation, the United States of\r\nAmerica, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and\r\nother concerned parties and countries for their assistance\r\nin the promotion of the inter-Tajik dialogue.\r\nHowever, I must state with regret that there have\r\nbeen recurrent outbreaks of violence, initiated by the\r\nunmotivated escalation of the armed opposition and\r\nmanifested in acts of terror, taking of hostages and other\r\nsubversive actions. We consider these actions a deviation\r\nfrom political methods of resolving contentious questions\r\nand reconciling existing contradictions. We also see them\r\nas showing disregard of the international community’s\r\nappeal to the Tajik parties to show restraint and\r\ncountenance no action that might impede the process of\r\nnegotiations.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nDespite those actions, the political leaders of\r\nTajikistan took a series of practical steps to strengthen\r\nconfidence-building measures. At its twentieth session the\r\nParliament of Tajikistan decided to postpone the\r\nreferendum and the elections. The aim of this initiative of\r\nthe members of Parliament was to involve the widest\r\npossible spectrum of political forces in the constitutional\r\nprocess, to give everyone wishing to return home an\r\nopportunity to do so and to let all our compatriots who had\r\nthe bad fortune to be outside the country take part in the\r\nelections. We are using this extra time to make proper\r\npreparations for addressing organizational questions\r\nconcerning the invitation of observers from the United\r\nNations, the CSCE, other international organizations and\r\ninterested countries to the elections.\r\nWe reaffirm our principled position to solve existing\r\ncontentious questions by means of dialogue. We are\r\nconvinced that the opposition’s reliance on force and the\r\ncommensurate reaction to it may cause unpredictable\r\nconsequences leading to the undermining of the stabilization\r\nprocess and of the positive decisions reached during\r\nnegotiations.\r\nAt the same time I consider it necessary to draw the\r\nAssembly’s attention to another very important aspect of\r\nthis problem. It seems that the irreconcilable wing of the\r\nopposition is cultivating plans of expanding the\r\ngeographical scope of the inter-Tajik conflict by instituting\r\nthe use of mercenaries in the armed confrontation. This\r\ncreates conditions for the internationalization of the conflict,\r\nwhich may in turn threaten to spread the confrontation\r\nthroughout Central Asia. It is easy to imagine what serious\r\nconsequences this may have.\r\nSpeaking from this rostrum, I must draw the\r\nAssembly’s attention to our anxiety over the current\r\nsituation in the neighbouring Islamic State of Afghanistan.\r\nThe world cannot remain indifferent to the situation in that\r\ncountry, where internecine war came to dominate social\r\nrelations. The Afghan conflict has brought forth a\r\ndangerous phenomenon: the emergence of anarchic\r\ngeographical units that can become a base for international\r\nterrorism and unpunished trafficking in weapons and drugs.\r\nThe situation on the Tajik-Afghan border keeps a vast\r\nregion in tension. Central Asia’s fragile backbone of\r\npolitical balance may not withstand the high pressure, and\r\nthe destructive processes taking place in Afghanistan right\r\nnow may lead to a regional cataclysm. We urge that the\r\nAfghan problem be given the world Community’s most\r\nserious consideration. Furthermore, we are convinced that\r\nthe alleviation of tension in Afghanistan will significantly\r\nand positively influence the solution of the inter-Tajik\r\nconflict. We have no doubt that the people of\r\nAfghanistan will ultimately achieve reconciliation and\r\nrestore peace to their country. We sincerely wish the\r\npeople of Afghanistan success in achieving these goals as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nIn current circumstances, with many hotbeds of\r\ntension caused by the cold war still existing, the\r\npeace-keeping efforts of the world community have a\r\nparticularly important role. It is evident that there are\r\ncertain rules limiting the use of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping forces, which reduces the effectiveness of\r\nmeasures taken by the Organization in this regard.\r\nI would once again like to draw the attention of the\r\nSecurity Council and the Assembly squarely to the\r\nquestion of giving to the Commonwealth of Independent\r\nStates (CIS) joint peace-keeping forces in Tajikistan the\r\nstatus of a United Nations operation. The CIS countries\r\nare helping Tajikistan with the protection of its southern\r\nborders, which are at the same time the borders of the\r\nCommonwealth. In this regard we recognize the special\r\nand leading role of Russia, which has been and remains\r\nthe guarantor of stability and security for all Central\r\nAsian States. We do not believe the presence of the CIS\r\npeace-keeping forces in our country contradicts the\r\ndecisions of the Security Council or the initiatives of the\r\nSecretary-General aimed at achieving peace in Tajikistan.\r\nMoreover, from our point of view, these forces are the\r\ndecisive factor in deterrence and in overcoming a state of\r\ncrisis on the Tajik-Afghan border. Taking a wider view\r\nof this problem, one might even see the outlines of a new\r\nconcept of security for the whole of Central Asia. We\r\nstill hope the Security Council will find it opportune to\r\nreconsider our initiative to call a special meeting of the\r\nCouncil to consider the situation in and around Tajikistan,\r\nas well as the question of giving the CIS joint\r\npeace-keeping forces the status of a United Nations\r\npeace-keeping force.\r\nThe tragedies of the peoples of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Rwanda, Somalia and the hot spots in the\r\nCIS all give evidence of the fact that the danger of\r\nnuclear catastrophe has been replaced by civil conflicts\r\ncaused by international, religious or ethnic differences and\r\nthat their recurrence is becoming the primary problem for\r\nthe world community.\r\nI should like to say a few words on the question of\r\nthe proposed reform of the Organization. On the whole\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nwe support the idea of expanding the Security Council.\r\nSuch a step, on the one hand, would reflect the global\r\nchanges taking place in today’s world and, on the other\r\nhand, would give an opportunity to achieve a more\r\nbalanced representation in the Council.\r\nThe emerging consensus on the need to enlarge the\r\nnumber of seats in the Security Council will probably\r\nimprove the efficiency of this central body of the United\r\nNations. In other words, the Council will enhance its\r\npotential, acquire more dynamism, increase the variety of\r\ndecisions it takes and generate a wider spectrum of ideas.\r\nThe world is diverse and is thus unique. Its diversity,\r\nhowever, does not preclude the process of integration. A\r\npraiseworthy example is Europe. A better future for\r\nmankind is apparently based on these kinds of processes.\r\nTajikistan as a member of the world community sees\r\nthe future of its development in the integration processes on\r\nvarious levels, in cooperation with neighbouring and distant\r\ncountries, regions and international organizations.\r\nThe activities of the CSCE have proved to us the\r\nefficiency of such cooperation. Its informal approach to the\r\naccelerated integration of Tajikistan into the international\r\ncommunity and the realization of the mandate of the CSCE\r\nMission to Tajikistan will undoubtedly be among the major\r\nfactors in the achievement of national reconciliation in our\r\ncountry. To a considerable extent we rely upon CSCE\r\nassistance to enhance democratic institutions and create a\r\nsociety founded on the rule of law and on the basis of high\r\nstandards that will provide universal human rights and\r\nfreedoms for every citizen. While carrying out active\r\npreparation for the upcoming Budapest summit meeting, we\r\nhope to put forward at that important forum our view of the\r\nproblems and to define the areas of cooperation.\r\nUndoubtedly for us the question of participation in the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States is vital.\r\nOur present position is that independence and\r\nsovereignty is not a sword but is rather the shield of a\r\nnation that must be strong but not heavy. Independence\r\nshould not burden human lives but on the contrary should\r\nmake everybody’s life easier and give all people on Earth\r\nthe opportunity to be equal. Principles of independence and\r\nsovereignty in the current period of history must be flexible\r\nand diverse, for the main goal is to ensure that people who\r\nused to have deeply rooted historical ties now have an\r\nopportunity for a wider realization of their economic and\r\nspiritual potential in the interests of future generations.\r\nIt is precisely in this light that we consider the\r\ndevelopment of the Commonwealth of Independent States\r\nthat is trying to find a mutually acceptable form of\r\nintegration without harming national interests. Despite\r\nwell-known difficulties the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States pragmatically searches for ways to\r\nrationalize all mechanisms of interaction among its\r\nmembers.\r\nI am convinced that the leadership and the people of\r\nStates members of the Commonwealth of Independent\r\nStates have by now recognized the truth that it is\r\nunrealistic to expect that, alone, a country can expect to\r\nsolve the task of renewing society and of carrying out\r\nreforms. We are facing the historical reality of building\r\nour future by cooperative and coordinated efforts.\r\nIn the post-Soviet period, Russia - a permanent\r\nmember of the Security Council - has assumed a heavy\r\nburden and responsibility for peace-keeping on a greater\r\npart of the territory of the former Soviet Union. We note\r\nwith deep satisfaction that these supreme efforts of Russia\r\nhave started to bring results. The multinational nation of\r\nTajikistan highly appreciates and welcomes the\r\npeace-keeping activities of Russia.\r\nI should like to note in this context that the ideas of\r\nconcluding a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, of\r\nadopting the decision on the Non-Proliferation Treaty’s\r\nopen-ended and unconditional extension, of developing\r\nregional programmes to strengthen peace and security,\r\nand other proposals put forward by Mr. Boris Yeltsin,\r\nPresident of the Russian Federation, in his address to the\r\nforty-ninth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly and aimed at strengthening international\r\nsecurity, all deserve the broadest support.\r\nTajikistan notes with gratitude the initiatives by\r\nUzbekistan to bring about a peaceful solution to the intra-\r\nTajik conflict and to ensure security and stability in the\r\nregion of Central Asia.\r\nWe highly appreciate our good-neighbourly relations\r\nwith the States of Central Asia. We hope that the sphere\r\nof their integration efforts will expand in the interests of\r\nall countries of the region of Central Asia. They deserve\r\ncareful study and support.\r\nNowadays it is universally recognized that alongside\r\npolitical questions, problems of social and economic\r\ndevelopment have assumed the same importance and\r\nurgency. The correctness of this statement is confirmed\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nby the conclusions reached at the end of the high-level\r\nEconomic and Social Council segment, that we support and\r\napprove. It is our firm conviction that the main aim of\r\nrestructuring the United Nations should be to preserve and\r\nincrease its potential to solve the whole range of\r\ndevelopment issues.\r\nFor the Republic of Tajikistan which has found itself\r\nin the hard grip of a transitional period aggravated by the\r\nconsequences of tragic events in recent years, the problem\r\nof economic survival has become a critical test. According\r\nto the \"development indicators\" data published by the\r\nWorld Bank, Tajikistan has been included in the group of\r\ncountries with the lowest level of per capita income.\r\nToday Tajikistan badly needs the help of the\r\ninternational community, not only to restore its economy\r\nbut also to create the conditions for long-term development.\r\nOur country, which is a land-locked State, is counting on\r\nspecial attention from the international community in\r\nmatters of economic and social development, and hopes that\r\nits appeal to include Tajikistan in the group of least\r\ndeveloped countries will be properly understood and\r\nsupported by the United Nations community.\r\nI assure Members that the highest objective for the\r\nleaders of the Republic of Tajikistan is the achievement of\r\nvalues common to all humanity, calmness and peace in our\r\nRepublic, the creation of a unified, peaceful, developed\r\nState of Tajikistan. And I hope that all countries of the\r\nworld will help us to achieve this noble objective.\r\nEighty years ago the fire of the First World War broke\r\nout, and very soon - in a few months - humanity will mark\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second World\r\nWar. These dates will forever be inscribed in the history\r\nof the twentieth century, in the history of the world. Still,\r\nthe dates themselves are not as important as the lessons\r\nwhich these events have taught us.\r\nThe bitter experience of the Second World War\r\npersuaded the leading Powers of the necessity to create an\r\ninternational organization the aim of which would be the\r\nmaintenance and enhancement of peace all over the world.\r\nThe main achievement of the United Nations during the\r\nalmost 50 years of its existence has been saving humankind\r\nfrom the fire of a new world war, and its development has\r\ntaken place on the basis of enhancing mutual understanding\r\nand cooperation, taking into account the interests of all\r\nparties, and the equality of large and small nations in the\r\nname of preserving our planet for future generations.\r\nNow, at the end of the twentieth century, it gives us\r\ngreat hope that the world community will not only\r\nprevent the outbreak of a third world war but will do its\r\nbest to make sure that the twenty-first century will\r\nbecome a period of creativity and calm on the whole\r\nplanet.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Head\r\nof State and Chairman of the Supreme Council of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, Head of\r\nState and Chairman of the Supreme Council of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by His Serene Highness Prince Albert,\r\nCrown Prince of Monaco\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Serene\r\nHighness Crown Prince Albert of Monaco.\r\nHis Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert of\r\nMonaco was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome His Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert of\r\nMonaco and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nCrown Prince Albert (interpretation from French):\r\nAt the outset, I should like to extend my sincere\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly, and to the newly elected members of the\r\nBureau. Your outstanding personal and professional\r\nqualities are, I am sure, a guarantee of the success of our\r\nwork.\r\nI also take this occasion to pay a tribute to your\r\npredecessor on the podium, Mr. Samuel Insanally, who,\r\noften in difficult circumstances, fulfilled his mandate\r\nexpertly and efficiently. For instance, the opportunity he\r\ngave us freely to express our opinions and ideas on\r\nseveral important problems of our time, such as that of\r\ndevelopment, was a significant initiative that will certainly\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nhave a positive impact on all our further thinking and work\r\non these questions.\r\nI turn now to our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, to thank him warmly for his efforts in\r\nundertaking the very complex and sensitive missions\r\nentrusted to him by the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil over the past months. Given that, in many\r\nrespects, the state of the world continues to deteriorate,\r\nthese efforts have been all the more worthy. While some\r\nconflicts were born or rekindled, others - often long-\r\nstanding, but no less virulent - have become worse or have\r\nexpanded. Brutality and violence, sometimes interethnic,\r\nhave all too often exploded, and no real means have existed\r\nor been available to redress their effects or the harm they\r\nhave caused.\r\nWhile we have been heartened by certain encouraging\r\ndevelopments in South Africa - which we welcome back to\r\ndemocratic life - or in the Middle East, many potential\r\nconflicts remain and others have already erupted or are\r\nabout to do so. Entire peoples are still under the yoke of\r\ndictatorship. The suffering and barbarity entailed are all the\r\nmore vicious and painful because the methods of repression\r\nhave kept pace with scientific and technical advances. The\r\ncrimes of the highest civilization go hand in hand with the\r\ncrimes of the highest barbarity. More than ever before,\r\nwomen, children, the elderly and the weakest and most\r\nvulnerable are threatened and victimized. When peace\r\ncollapses - and the more fragile it is the more violent is its\r\ncollapse - war quickly becomes total, and civilian\r\npopulations, especially the poorest, are rarely spared.\r\nThe international community, pained and\r\noverwhelmed, can only resort, in desperation, to\r\nhumanitarian assistance. Bosnia and Herzegovina and\r\nRwanda are the most striking examples of this. Most often,\r\nthis humanitarian assistance comes in response to tragic\r\nsituations and complex political circumstances that make it\r\ndifficult to deliver and, despite all the haste and the efforts\r\nmade, render its benefits uncertain.\r\nBearing in mind the decisions taken by the Security\r\nCouncil in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a view\r\nto protecting the civilian populations, and inspired by the\r\ncourageous and generous initiative recently undertaken by\r\nFrance in Rwanda with the support of Africa and the\r\nUnited Nations, should not the international community\r\nadopt a convention-based instrument that would meet this\r\nchallenge? For such challenges could face it again in the\r\nfuture.\r\nThrough such an instrument, States parties would\r\nundertake in advance to authorize in case of a conflict the\r\nestablishment of protection and security areas reserved for\r\ndefenceless children, women and the elderly. The\r\nboundaries of these zones would, of course, need to be\r\nclearly established, with the agreement of the State or\r\nStates concerned. Special access routes to such areas -\r\nneutralized airports, roads and railroads - would be\r\nprovided for in this treaty in order to ensure the delivery\r\nof humanitarian assistance. The protection and\r\nfunctioning of these areas would have to be guaranteed by\r\nunarmed agents, preferably volunteers, under the auspices\r\nand responsibility of the United Nations, and they would\r\nwear white helmets or have some other distinctive\r\ninsignia, as has already been suggested.\r\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the\r\nProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12\r\nAugust 1949 - which envisaged cordons sanitaires and\r\nsecurity zones, without however making them mandatory\r\n- could serve as a model to a great extent when we\r\nconsider this matter. Does not protection for the most\r\nvulnerable sectors of the non-combatant population -\r\nchildren, women and the elderly - deserve true\r\ninternational commitment? It would be particularly\r\nsignificant and symbolic if, on the occasion of its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, after considering a desirability study drafted\r\nby the Secretary-General, our Organization equipped itself\r\nwith such an instrument, open for signature by all States,\r\nproviding for the establishment of humanitarian zones in\r\ntime of conflict.\r\nIn this way, the High Commissioner for Refugees,\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund and international\r\ncharitable institutions such as the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross or certain non-governmental\r\norganizations recognized for their humanitarian activities\r\nwould be in a better position rapidly to provide\r\nprotection, relief and assistance to the civilian populations\r\nafflicted by destructive conflicts and deprived of their\r\nmost fundamental rights.\r\nWhile it is more important than ever for our\r\nOrganization to secure for itself effective means of\r\nprotecting innocent civilian populations, we must none the\r\nless not neglect future generations. By depleting the\r\nnatural resources of our Earth and damaging our\r\nenvironment, often out of simple negligence, we are\r\njeopardizing the future and the happiness of our children.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco is fully aware of this and is\r\nstriving to assist to the extent within its power in\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nprotecting the environment as well as in combating\r\npollution in the oceans and seas.\r\nBy virtue of its maritime traditions, Monaco has\r\nprimarily throughout its history stressed the protection of\r\nthe resources of the marine environment. A large number\r\nof initiatives have been taken in this respect on the local,\r\nregional and even international levels. The Principality is\r\nalways ready to step up its efforts and to strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation in these areas.\r\nIndeed, in this respect a cooperative undertaking with\r\nthe United Nations has existed since 1961. Pursuant to an\r\nagreement concluded between the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency and the Government of Monaco, an\r\ninternational marine radioactivity laboratory has been\r\noperating in the Principality. This laboratory has garnered\r\nimportant and interesting experience in the realm of the\r\nmeasurement of levels of radioactivity in the seas and\r\noceans. With the assistance of the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme, it has developed various methods\r\nof monitoring the marine environment on a worldwide\r\nscale.\r\nThe proclamation of 1998 as the International Year of\r\nthe Ocean, as proposed by the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, would, I am convinced, provide an opportunity to\r\nbolster this international cooperation and to once again take\r\nstock of the marine environment, after the assessment\r\ndrawn up in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 at the Earth Summit.\r\nIn this spirit, we have paid particular attention to\r\ncertain conclusions of the Fourth United Nations\r\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks whose migrations take place both within and\r\noutside exclusive economic zones, which took place here in\r\nAugust. The alarm that was sounded as a result in\r\nparticular of the report drawn up by the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations with respect\r\nto the overexploitation of the seas and oceans cannot leave\r\nus indifferent. The careful husbandry and use of such\r\nprecious marine resources and the stepped up struggle to\r\ncombat marine pollution should continue to be the subject\r\nof the most energetic and attentive concern on the part of\r\nthis Organization.\r\nThe agreement recently adopted in the context of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - and we\r\nvery much welcome the felicitous conclusion of that\r\nagreement - demonstrates that with goodwill, the\r\ninternational community can find the right formulae to\r\naccommodate the interests of all by preserving the general\r\ninterest, that is, thinking globally but also acting locally.\r\nOnly world cooperation can make it possible to\r\nsolve the grave problems associated with safeguarding our\r\nenvironment and as a result respond to the tremendous\r\nchallenges that we face now and will increasingly face in\r\nthe future. With future generations in mind, I feel\r\nimpelled to speak of the future of our Organization,\r\nwhich next year will celebrate a landmark event: its\r\nfiftieth anniversary.\r\nImportant world conferences - the one on population\r\nand development which has just concluded in Cairo, the\r\none on social development scheduled for Copenhagen in\r\nMarch next year, or the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, which will take place in September 1995 in\r\nBeijing - have been and will be opportunities to intensify\r\nour thinking and build up our means of intervention in\r\nkey areas for the future.\r\nThe work in progress to improve the functioning of\r\nthe Organization and its structures is encouraging. The\r\nGovernment of the Principality is following these\r\ndevelopments with interest.\r\nI should be remiss if I concluded my statement\r\nwithout thanking the members of the Security Council\r\nand the States that have contributed to peace-keeping\r\noperations and without stating that the Principality fully\r\nappreciates the sacrifices made. Men and women serving\r\nthe Organization have lost their lives. We salute them\r\nand pay tribute to their memory. We must be watchful -\r\nand this is a major responsibility - in order to ensure\r\nbetter protection for these soldiers of peace while\r\nremembering their wives, their children and their families.\r\nOur action is and should always be designed first\r\nand foremost to serve mankind, to alleviate its sufferings\r\nand remedy the evils of its plight. Is it not time at last to\r\nsay, as André Breton wrote, \"for man to go over to the\r\nside of man, lock, stock and barrel\".\r\nI wish, as I conclude my statement, to express my\r\nfervent and sincere wishes for the success of the work of\r\nthis forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI venture to hope that thanks to general goodwill and\r\nmutual understanding we may be able to find practical\r\nand effective solutions, in keeping with the spirit and\r\nletter of the Charter of the United Nations, to the key\r\nissues before us for our consideration.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Crown\r\nPrince of the Principality of Monaco for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Albert, Crown Prince of\r\nMonaco, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Culture, Youth and\r\nSport of Liechtenstein, Her Excellency Ms. Andrea Willi.\r\nMs. Willi (Liechtenstein): At the outset, let me\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. I wish you\r\nevery success and pledge you the full support of my\r\ndelegation. I also wish to commend your predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, for\r\nthe excellent and able manner in which he conducted the\r\nwork of the forty-eighth session.\r\nUnder his wise guidance, the Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations, during the forty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, engaged in a creative and constructive\r\ndialogue on a question likely to have a great impact on the\r\nfuture work and credibility of the United Nations, that of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the membership\r\nof the Security Council. The report of the Working Group,\r\nwhich was adopted on 14 September by the General\r\nAssembly, makes it clear that these discussions have had a\r\npositive beginning and that much more work in a\r\nconstructive and open-minded spirit remains to be done in\r\norder to find a solution acceptable to all Member States.\r\nEven though detailed discussion of this sensitive issue must\r\nbe continued by the Working Group, I should like to\r\nreiterate at this juncture that the Government of\r\nLiechtenstein attaches the utmost importance to maintaining\r\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the work of the Security\r\nCouncil, and that at the same time it holds the view that the\r\ndiscussions of the Working Group should cover not only\r\nthe enlargement of the Council, but also, and to no less an\r\nextent, its working methods.\r\nThe second session of the Preparatory Committee for\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development, which will take\r\nplace in Copenhagen in March 1995, concluded its work\r\njust three weeks ago. The Liechtenstein Government is\r\nencouraged by the results of this session, which prove that\r\nthe preparatory process is on the right track, and we are\r\nconfident that the consultations to be held by Ambassador\r\nSomavía during the last week of October will lay a solid\r\nbasis for the work of the third session and bring Member\r\nStates closer to achieving the important goal of a final\r\ndocument which can be adopted by consensus. The\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development can be a crucial\r\nevent for the future of mankind, and we must not miss\r\nthis opportunity to promote social progress and better\r\nstandards of living in greater freedom, which is one of the\r\nmost noble goals of this Organization. This gathering, as\r\nthe draft final document acknowledges, is closely\r\ninterlinked with other important conferences, notably the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nwhich was successfully concluded on 13 September in\r\nCairo, and the Fourth World Conference on Women, to\r\nbe held in Beijing in September 1995.\r\nAmong other subjects under consideration by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the draft final document also mentions\r\nthe International Year of the Family, which we are still\r\ncelebrating. I wish to underline that, in the view of the\r\nLiechtenstein Government, a concise summary and\r\nanalysis of the activities undertaken within the framework\r\nof the International Year of the Family, at both the\r\nnational and the regional levels, can make a substantive\r\ncontribution to the successful outcome of the two United\r\nNations world conferences in 1995, and at the same time\r\ncan help achieve the goal of making the International\r\nYear of the Family not an isolated event, but, rather, one\r\nwhich will have a continuing and long-term impact on\r\nnational policies as well as on regional and international\r\ncooperation. Liechtenstein has undertaken manifold\r\nactivities in order to celebrate the International Year;\r\namongst other things, it dedicated the commemorative\r\nactivities for its National Day on 15 August to the\r\nobjectives of the International Year. The Government of\r\nLiechtenstein therefore wholeheartedly welcomes the\r\ndecision of the General Assembly, taken in its resolution\r\n47/237 of September 1993, to hold an international\r\nconference on the family, which will take place here in\r\nNew York on 18 October, and hopes to be in a position\r\nto contribute to giving the International Year a lasting\r\nimpact.\r\nMr. Arzoumanian (Armenia), Vice President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn our view, preventive diplomacy, as outlined in\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\", could and should be used more\r\noften and more efficiently. We commend the activities of\r\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(CSCE). Especially since the 1990 Summit meeting in\r\nParis, when the leaders of 36 States signed and committed\r\nthemselves to the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the\r\nCSCE has shown that it can play a most useful role in\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nmonitoring specific situations and in initiating negotiation\r\nprocesses. We are of the opinion that improved\r\ncoordination of the activities of the Conference and those\r\nof the United Nations can achieve very fruitful results.\r\nThe international political environment has changed.\r\nHaving been accorded its rightful place in the promotion\r\nand maintenance of international peace and security, the\r\nUnited Nations now has as one of its central tasks that of\r\nplaying a more active role than ever before in conflict\r\nresolution. Unfortunately it must be stated again this year\r\nthat the sheer number and magnitude of the conflicts\r\nsurpass the abilities of this Organization. There is no\r\nregion in the world without a conflict of some sort; regional\r\nconflicts have become a major threat to international peace\r\nand security. We are aware that peace-keeping must be and\r\nwill remain one of the Organization’s most important\r\ninstruments for maintaining peace and security in the world,\r\nbut peace-keeping operations have to be provided with clear\r\nmandates and be set within a reasonable and realistic time-\r\nframe. Since Liechtenstein became a member of the United\r\nNations in 1990 the expenses for peace-keeping operations\r\nhave increased dramatically. We are aware that the\r\nchanging global situation has made an increase of\r\npeace-keeping activities unavoidable, but it should also be\r\nnoted that these costs increasingly constitute a heavy burden\r\nfor national budgets.\r\nIn this connection, we should note that we welcome\r\nthe creation of the post of an Under-Secretary-General for\r\nInternal Oversight Services and the appointment of Mr.\r\nKarl Theodor Paschke to this post. We hope that this\r\nimportant step will lead to improved financial management\r\nof the United Nations and at the same time to timely and\r\nfull payment of assessed contributions by all Member\r\nStates, both into the regular budget and for peace-keeping\r\nactions.\r\nThe Liechtenstein Government attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to the promotion and protection of human rights\r\nand I wish to emphasize that the Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action adopted by the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights in Vienna in June 1993 can, if it is followed\r\nby full implementation of its provisions, constitute a\r\nmilestone in the history of the United Nations. The\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session took a first and\r\nvery important step by adopting the mandate for the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, a post which had been\r\nunder discussion for a very long time. I wish to thank\r\nAmbassador Ayala Lasso for all the efforts he has\r\nundertaken so far in fulfilling his very difficult task and to\r\nassure him of our full support. However, more and\r\ndetermined action by the General Assembly is needed,\r\nincluding the allocation of an increased percentage of the\r\noverall budget of the United Nations to the Centre for\r\nHuman Rights in order to enable it to carry out its tasks\r\neven more efficiently.\r\nThe United Nations is approaching its fiftieth\r\nanniversary and preparing to commemorate that event in\r\na dignified manner. I should like to thank\r\nUnder-Secretary-General Gillian Sorensen for her untiring\r\nefforts with regard to the commemorative activities of the\r\nOrganization. The jubilee is also a good opportunity to\r\nbring the purposes and the work of the United Nations\r\ncloser to the individuals, the people, who are the central\r\nsubject of the Organization’s endeavours. Liechtenstein\r\nwishes to contribute to achieving this goal and has\r\ntherefore scheduled several activities, information on\r\nwhich will be provided in due course. I should like,\r\nhowever, to avail myself of this opportunity to refer\r\nbriefly to a project which is of particular importance to us\r\nand, we believe, of direct relevance for the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn one of Liechtenstein’s first contributions to these\r\ngeneral debates after becoming a Member of the United\r\nNations, His Serene Highness Prince Hans Adam II,\r\nRuling Prince and Head of State of Liechtenstein,\r\nintroduced at the forty-sixth session of the Assembly an\r\ninitiative on certain aspects of self-determination, and he\r\nelaborated on it at later sessions, including the\r\nforty-eighth. Self-determination has been of very great\r\nimportance in the history of the United Nations and is, of\r\ncourse, enshrined as a principle in its Charter. As\r\nrepresentatives of Liechtenstein have outlined on several\r\noccasions, our initiative seeks to open up for discussion\r\nby the international community certain aspects of the right\r\nof self-determination and to encourage a more flexible\r\nand practical implementation of that right.\r\nLast year, at the request of the delegation of\r\nLiechtenstein, a new sub-item was included in the agenda\r\nof the General Assembly, entitled \"Effective realization of\r\nthe right to self-determination through autonomy\" . We\r\nhad a very interesting debate in the Third Committee, at\r\nthe close of which Member States, while agreeing to\r\nconsider the matter further at a later stage, preferred not\r\nto do so during this present, forty-ninth, session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Reactions and comments made during\r\nand surrounding the debate by a large number of\r\ncountries, as well as developments on the international\r\nscene, have confirmed our view that this initiative is\r\ntimely and potentially valuable for the international\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\ncommunity. We will therefore be pursuing it as\r\nconstructively as possible.\r\nIt seems to us that at this stage it would be most\r\nappropriate, and most likely to lead to fruitful results, for\r\nthis subject to be developed further within an academic,\r\nrather than a political, framework. His Serene Highness\r\nPrince Hans Adam II has therefore, as one element of\r\nLiechtenstein’s contribution to the commemoration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary, given a grant to Princeton University’s\r\nWoodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs\r\nto establish a research programme on self-determination to\r\nbe conducted under the auspices of the Woodrow Wilson\r\nSchool’s Center of International Studies. Two conferences\r\nare to be organized in March and June 1995 within the\r\nframework of this research programme. They will be open\r\nfor participation to all Member States of the United\r\nNations, and I wish to extend an invitation to all States to\r\ncontinue working together with us to make further progress\r\non this crucially important question.\r\nInternational law is the best guarantee of respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms as well as of\r\ninternational peace and security. In the case of\r\nLiechtenstein, it is also the only guarantee. I therefore wish\r\nto reaffirm our commitment to cooperate with all States in\r\nfurther strengthening international law in order to achieve\r\na secure, a peaceful and a prosperous future for the\r\ngenerations to come.\r\nThe President: I now call upon the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta and\r\nformer President of the General Assembly, His Excellency\r\nthe Honourable Professor Guido de Marco.\r\nMr. de Marco (Malta): I should like to join others in\r\ncongratulating the President on his election to preside over\r\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The\r\nwealth of his political and professional experience and his\r\npersonal qualities will undoubtedly benefit the work of the\r\nAssembly in the coming months.\r\nHe takes over his new responsibilities from His\r\nExcellency Mr. Insanally who, as President during the\r\nforty-eighth session, continued to give the presidency that\r\nforward-looking spirit which is so important as the United\r\nNations system and, at its very centre, the General\r\nAssembly increasingly become the effective focal point of\r\ninternational life.\r\nFive years after the end of the Cold War, the\r\ninternational community continues to witness painful\r\nsituations of political, economic and social strife.\r\nDaily the media bombard us with images of misery:\r\nvictims of wars fleeing combat zones, abandoning all they\r\nhad worked for and accumulated in a life-time; refugees\r\ncrossing deserts or oceans in superhuman efforts to\r\ndistance themselves from situations where human dignity\r\nis trampled upon, where the essence of human rights has\r\nlong been lost; the poor and the needy nurturing hopes of\r\nescaping from communities where development is absent\r\nor denied.\r\nThe list of anguish is endless. Most of us are\r\ndisturbed and angered at the apparent impotence of the\r\ninternational community to attack the root causes of such\r\nmisery.\r\nWe tend to link many of these situations to the end\r\nof the Cold War and its aftermath, aware that the\r\ntransition in international power relations has had an\r\neffect which goes far beyond its immediate political\r\nimpact. It has influenced in different ways the economic\r\nand social dynamic not only of those States undergoing\r\nthe process of transition, but even others - a spill-over\r\neffect which is as difficult to contain as it is difficult to\r\nidentify and map out.\r\nWe have entered a historical phase marked and\r\nchequered by regional conflicts - wars which sow death\r\nand destruction and erase social and economic\r\nachievements in a matter of weeks if not days.\r\nThere is the temptation to develop an immunity to\r\nthe tragic consequences of these ills by giving up on our\r\ncollective responsibility to alleviate suffering. Every time\r\nthe international community gives in to this temptation it\r\nis rudely awakened by degenerating situations which we\r\ncannot but find shocking.\r\nAntagonisms with roots which go back in time have\r\nexploded into situations of conflict and civil strife,\r\nexposing a heritage of ethnic, religious and tribal\r\nanimosities. Massacres on an unprecedented scale have\r\ndevastated our collective conscience.\r\nThe transition has created a vacuum. In attempting\r\nto fill this vacuum, the new and frail forces of democratic\r\npolitical leadership often have to encounter antagonistic\r\neconomic, political and social forces interested in carving\r\na niche for themselves through the perpetuation of\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\ninstability. Illegal drug and arms traffickers, money\r\nlaunderers and unscrupulous economic operators stand to\r\nprofit from an unregulated fiscal, political and social\r\nenvironment. They often join forces in efforts to\r\nundermine the consolidation of democracy and the rule of\r\nlaw. The international community has long realized that\r\nsuch ills cannot be tackled in isolation. Cooperation has\r\nbeen strengthened in areas where borders fail to stop the\r\nspread of criminality.\r\nThe ills of the present age also require enhanced\r\nbilateral and regional cooperation. Regions may learn\r\nlessons from each other as different illicit trade routes\r\nranging from drugs to plutonium, appear to spread their\r\ntentacles to encompass the globe. The heart of the matter\r\nlies, however, in rehabilitating those social environments\r\nwhich the illicit trade invades, thrives upon and exploits.\r\nSafeguarding the dignity of every human being,\r\nthrough the full respect for the right to life, liberty and\r\nsecurity of person must remain the basis of our collective\r\naction.\r\nWe all declare ourselves committed to the principles\r\nenshrined 46 years ago in the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. This commitment, however, has oft fallen\r\nvictim to that pragmatic approach which demands looking\r\nthe other way - a philosophy that justifies living with the\r\nlesser evil, supposedly to avoid the greater evil. The\r\nfallacy of this approach has been seen in many and varied\r\ninstances, ranging from corruption within the body politic,\r\nto totalitarianism at the national level, to trans-boundary\r\ncrime and terrorism at the international level.\r\nFor five years we have been speaking of the creation\r\nof a new international order. The words and setting were\r\npraiseworthy, as was the commitment to do good. In our\r\neuphoria, we assumed that our desire for a new world\r\ncommunity where law, order and development should\r\nprevail was universally shared.\r\nCrude realities have proved that in making this\r\nassumption we failed to note that our desire for good could\r\nbe matched, indeed challenged, by the evil intentions of\r\nothers. It was thought that this challenge could come only\r\nfrom existing regimes which we rightfully tried to treat as\r\noutcasts - little realizing that the roots of the issue were\r\nmore widespread and lay in the lack of balance and\r\nharmonious development of economic and socio-political\r\nsystems.\r\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round this year and\r\nthe setting up of the World Trade Organization could\r\nprovide us with a channel where trade practices become\r\nmore transparent and fair. Trade is the driving force\r\nbehind economic growth and social stability. Lack of\r\nviable economic activity erodes the basis of democratic\r\nsocieties, rendering them fragile and subject to instability.\r\nOne cannot but praise the efforts of the peoples and\r\nGovernments of many States in striving to build stable\r\neconomic infrastructures. Their enterprise cannot be\r\nachieved without the constant support of developed States\r\nwith long-established free-market economies.\r\nA new approach requires that we gird ourselves\r\nproperly to face the challenges ahead. On the national\r\nlevel, political and socio-economic structures must ensure\r\ndignity for one and all.\r\nOn 21 September, Malta celebrated the thirtieth\r\nanniversary of its independence. During these three\r\ndecades, many were the challenges faced and the lessons\r\nlearnt. Democracy based on the dignity of each citizen is\r\na task that requires an ever-renewing commitment by all\r\nsocial forces to the right to freedom of opinion.\r\nPluralism is an essential catalyst in the democratic\r\nprocess and requires that we honour its full meaning in\r\nthe different areas where it manifests itself. However\r\nmuch this impetus is strengthened when fired by\r\nGovernments, it is handicapped each time an authoritarian\r\nGovernment assumes that it can rule by diktat. During\r\nthe past seven years my Government has committed itself\r\nto strengthening pluralism in such vital areas as\r\nbroadcasting, education and trade. Pluralism is a vote of\r\nconfidence in the people, and a democratically elected\r\nGovernment cannot but reciprocate the trust bestowed by\r\nthe electorate.\r\nThe consolidation of democracy was not the only\r\nchallenge we had to face. During these 30 years we\r\nradically transformed an economy entirely dependent on\r\nthe presence of foreign military bases into one benefiting\r\nfrom thriving financial, industrial and tourism sectors.\r\nThis transition has given Malta the economic buoyancy\r\nrequired of it as a prospective member of the European\r\nUnion. We note with satisfaction the decision, taken last\r\nJune at the Corfu Summit, that Malta will be included in\r\nthe next phase of the enlargement of the European Union.\r\nThis state of economic well-being has enabled the\r\nGovernment to consolidate a social policy inspired by the\r\nconcept of solidarity. Over three decades we have\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nintroduced schemes ensuring equal access for men and\r\nwomen by providing appropriate formal educational and\r\nsocial structures.\r\nIn enacting this policy, the Government has not\r\nignored its responsibility to ensure a dignified life for all\r\nthrough programmes that range from free medical aid for\r\nall citizens to care of the elderly and integration of the\r\nhandicapped.\r\nToday, Malta can rightfully claim to be a nation at\r\npeace with itself and with others. Though conscious of our\r\nlimitations, we have never let size inhibit our mature\r\ninvolvement in the international arena. On the occasion of\r\nthe recent signing of the Agreement on the implementation\r\nof part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea, many representatives acknowledged Malta’s role in\r\nlaunching the concept of common heritage - a concept that\r\ntoday is the guiding principle in a number of conventions.\r\nMalta stands committed to the creation of a global society\r\nbased on the principles of dignity and solidarity.\r\nThroughout the centuries, Malta has had its existence\r\nmarked by the contradiction between its size and its\r\nstrategic importance. This has necessitated an\r\nunderstanding of the importance of regional stability\r\nthrough cooperation. Since independence, we have\r\ncultivated an awareness of the importance of stability in the\r\nMediterranean. The progress registered in the Middle East\r\npeace process following the signing of the Declaration of\r\nPrinciples and the Washington Accords of 13 September\r\n1993 makes it easier to understand the importance of the\r\ninterdependence of European security and Mediterranean\r\nsecurity.\r\nMalta has been the first in international forums - and\r\nhas sometimes been alone - to advocate the need for a\r\nMediterranean dialogue, and it has been consistent in\r\nadvancing proposals to this end. Over the years since the\r\nHelsinki Summit Declaration we have promoted the link\r\nbetween security in Europe and security in the\r\nMediterranean.\r\nToday, the Mediterranean dimension is high on the\r\ninternational agenda. From both sides of this sea of destiny\r\nthe need for a Mediterranean forum has been underlined -\r\nnot for the sake of creating another international body but\r\nas an aspect of the logic of existence in the light of the\r\nmany problems in the region. These problems range from\r\nunemployment to overpopulation, terrorism and ethnic strife\r\n- all in a narrow highway that affects stability in the region\r\nand beyond, thus threatening the future of millions.\r\nWe cannot, therefore, but identify ourselves with\r\nForeign Minister Alain Juppé, who, in his address to this\r\nAssembly at its 8th plenary meeting, stated that France\r\nwould like to see Europe organizing a forum for\r\ncooperation involving all the Mediterranean States, and\r\nwould be making this one of the main goals of the\r\nforthcoming French presidency of the European Union.\r\nWe also welcome the statement made at the 6th plenary\r\nmeeting by the President of the Council of Ministers of\r\nthe European Union - Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel -\r\nthat Europe attaches great importance to security in the\r\nMediterranean.\r\nPrincipled cooperation reflects a fundamental and\r\nessential Maltese social reality. It was through the\r\nextension of this matured concept to the broader European\r\nand international level that, within the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), Malta\r\nlaunched the initiative for the Conference to declare itself\r\na regional arrangement for the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity in the terms of Chapter VIII of the United\r\nNations Charter - a declaration adopted by CSCE Heads\r\nof State and Government at the Helsinki II Summit.\r\nIn calling for a new approach at the regional level,\r\nwe cannot but renew our support for, and our\r\ncommitment to, the CSCE process. The CSCE was the\r\nfirst body to give tangible form to the connection between\r\nthe political, economic and human dimensions. The\r\nCSCE need not be copied in its detail by other regions,\r\nbut it provides a model of confidence-building to which\r\nother regions can aspire.\r\nThe need for a new approach has long been felt at\r\nthe United Nations. Initiatives taken by Malta when it\r\noccupied the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-fifth session, four years ago, are slowly bearing\r\nfruit. However, it is only legitimate to ask whether the\r\nresults are proportionate to the efforts made. My\r\nGovernment welcomes as a step in the right direction the\r\nrecently adopted resolution on revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Important as it is, this step cannot but\r\nlead to others meant to enhance the role of this forum.\r\nWe have to maintain the central role of the General\r\nAssembly in the framework of the United Nations. This\r\nis the only forum where all members are permanent\r\nmembers. We believe that the General Assembly has to\r\ndevelop and define the fact-finding mechanism that\r\npertains to it. We also have to ensure what former\r\nSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar referred to as\r\n\"a balanced constitutional relationship\". The maintenance\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nof this relationship with and between the principal organs\r\nof the Organization, including the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretariat, is important not as an\r\nissue of the internal working of the Organization but\r\nbecause \"it bears on the guardianship of peace exercised by\r\nthe United Nations \".\r\nIn his report \"An Agenda for Peace\", Secretary-\r\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali underlines the relevance of\r\nthe General Assembly as a universal forum by calling for\r\nrecognition of its capacity to consider and recommend\r\nappropriate action in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. He says:\r\n\"To that end it is essential to promote its utilization by\r\nall Member States so as to bring greater influence to\r\nbear in pre-empting or containing situations which are\r\nlikely to threaten peace and security.\" (A/47/277,\r\npara. 36)\r\nIn this respect, the reforms related to the restructuring\r\nof the Security Council, which we hope will be negotiated\r\nby next year, have a bearing because of the qualitative\r\nchange they would generate. My Government is studying\r\nthe proposals already submitted, including the Italian\r\nproposal presented yesterday by Foreign Minister Martino.\r\nNext year we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations system. The international community\r\nis becoming more aware of the vast extent of common\r\nconcerns which bond our fate as a global community. A\r\nnumber of international conventions today make specific\r\nreference to the common heritage of mankind.\r\nThe universal acceptance of this principle is to our\r\ncollective credit. It is proof of the sense of responsibility\r\nand equity that inspires Member States in their obligations\r\ntowards present and future generations. Only an underlying\r\nsolidarity can ensure the survival of the planet. This sense\r\nof inter-generation solidarity truly dignifies humanity.\r\nMalta has underlined the need for a unit to coordinate\r\nand monitor areas related to the common heritage. A\r\nconvergence of all efforts becomes instrumental to the\r\nefficiency with which such initiatives, born of conventions,\r\nmay work and bear fruit.\r\nA scenario marked by institutional fragmentation can\r\nbe avoided only by establishing institutional oversight in the\r\ninterest of the areas we hold in trust for future generations.\r\nRather than reinventing the wheel, we are proposing a\r\ntransition and evolution in the role of Trusteeship Council,\r\nfor we are convinced that the Trusteeship Council could\r\nbe such a point of convergence.\r\nWe have taken note of the part of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization which\r\ndeals with the Trusteeship Council and, in particular, the\r\nrecommendation that the General Assembly proceed with\r\nsteps to eliminate that organ in accordance with Article\r\n108 of the Charter. We agree with the Secretary- General\r\nthat with the end of the Trusteeship Agreement on Palau\r\nthe Council, as conceived, has concluded its task.\r\nThe concept of trust - a concept of English Common\r\nLaw which is fundamental in its fiduciary nature - is one\r\nthat reflects the mission of the League of Nations and\r\nlater the United Nations in so far as certain Territories\r\nwere concerned. We have to apply the concept of trust\r\nto new realities. We believe that the United Nations\r\nholds in trust for humanity its common heritage and its\r\ncommon concerns: the environment; the resources of the\r\nsea and of the seabed; the climate; the rights of future\r\ngenerations; and the safeguarding of the rights of peoples\r\nin situations of complete breakdown of the organs of the\r\nState. We believe that we hold these in trust for\r\nhumanity, and an enhanced and redefined Trusteeship\r\nCouncil can be the right organ for this purpose.\r\nThe challenges of the present times demand that we\r\nlook at the United Nations system with innovative eyes.\r\nWe cannot aspire to a new world order and yet persist in\r\nviewing the institutional mechanisms of the United\r\nNations through the same cold-war lenses, which are ill\r\nfocused for our times and now shattered by the course of\r\nhistory. We need to view the United Nations as a\r\ncomplex adaptive system, a system which, without\r\nrenouncing its original ideals and basic principles,\r\nresponds adequately and promptly to contemporary needs,\r\na proactive United Nations rather than a reactive one, a\r\nUnited Nations which moulds a new mentality apart from\r\nironing creases and mending tears in the fabric of\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe challenge today is not a physical dividing wall.\r\nThis generation can one day look back with pride at what\r\nit has achieved. The recent ceremonies marking the\r\ndeparture of foreign troops stationed in Germany is a\r\nreminder of how significantly different political realities\r\nare today from the days when the Berlin Wall cut across\r\na city, a nation and a continent with the same callousness\r\nwith which it cut across the soul and spirit of Europe.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nEqually breathtaking was the transition from a South\r\nAfrica built on the bastion of apartheid to a democratic\r\nSouth Africa which cherishes the dignity of all of its\r\ncitizens.\r\nThe walls of division are also being dismantled in the\r\nMiddle East, where political determination and goodwill\r\ncan and should ensure the full enjoyment of sovereignty\r\nand political rights for all peoples living in the region.\r\nHowever, there are many other situations at which we\r\nshall some day look back in anger. The challenge to our\r\npolitical will today is the tragedy of the children in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, the rotting, butchered bodies floating in\r\nthe rivers of Rwanda, the millions of refugees with their\r\nlives wasted in never-ending waiting, the other millions of\r\ndepressed and oppressed living an existence without\r\ndignity.\r\n1995 is a year of challenge. It is the year of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and of the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, the next two links in the\r\ntriad begun with the recent International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development at Cairo. Three Conferences\r\nwhich, with Habitat II, require a global approach focused\r\non development rather than on the promotion of hidden\r\nagendas which are irrelevant in the resolution of essential\r\nissues - essential issues which represent a billion people\r\nliving in abject poverty, half of whom go to bed hungry\r\nevery day.\r\nThere is a poverty curtain which continues to create a\r\ngreat divide and which becomes more impenetrable when\r\nwe wilfully shut our eyes to the concept of solidarity.\r\nEmpowerment becomes a mere cliché if it fails to ensure a\r\nlife in dignity for this ocean of humanity denied of its most\r\nbasic right to life, liberty and security of person.\r\nIn issuing declarations we do well to underline our\r\ncommitment to eradicating the root causes that generate so\r\nmuch misery, anguish and pain. We do even better when\r\nwe make firm commitments on assistance to States which\r\nrequire our solidarity, States in need that require us to\r\nmatch our words with deeds.\r\nSolidarity means reaching out rather than holding out.\r\nSolidarity is the building block of greater security to ensure\r\nthe livelihood and dignity of millions. Solidarity is a key\r\nfactor in the promotion of development in the lives and\r\nminds of men, and hence in the complex relations that\r\nguide the international community.\r\nOur legacy to future generations would be a poor\r\none if development and solidarity were not matched by\r\ncompliance with international standards of human rights.\r\nThe importance of the rule of law and democracy requires\r\nthat the international community safeguard human rights.\r\nDenial of liberty is the refusal of that oxygen that enables\r\na developed community to live in harmony with itself and\r\nothers. The challenge of the twenty-first century is not\r\nliberty in the abstract: it is the responsibility of the\r\nUnited Nations to be an instrument in forging principles\r\ninto concrete action.\r\nA second-generation United Nations facing the\r\nchallenge of solidarity must serve as a guidepost to\r\nhumanity in its long walk towards peace in freedom.\r\nMr. Jayakumar (Singapore): First, it gives me great\r\npleasure to congratulate the President on his unanimous\r\nelection. Like other colleagues who have preceded me,\r\nI am confident that he will guide us through this session\r\neffectively. Allow me also to place on record our\r\nappreciation for his predecessor, Ambassador Insanally,\r\nwho presided over a very hectic and productive session.\r\nThe end of the cold war has not led us to the end of\r\nconflicts. Instead, it has given rise to many internecine,\r\nintra-State ethnic and religious conflicts, bringing\r\ndestruction, chaos and suffering in their wake. With the\r\nmajor Powers preoccupied with their domestic economic,\r\npolitical, social and other problems, the world has had no\r\nchoice but to turn to the United Nations for help. Firstly,\r\nthere is no alternative. Secondly, there is the expectation\r\nthat, freed of the past super-Power rivalry that had\r\nimmobilized the United Nations, the United Nations will\r\nnow be able to fulfil the aims of its founding fathers to\r\ncreate a better world.\r\nIn the last few years, with these demands for United\r\nNations action increasing manifold, the United Nations\r\nhas had to grapple simultaneously with many trouble\r\nspots around the world. In its first 42 years of existence\r\nuntil 1988, the United Nations launched only 13 peace-\r\nkeeping operations. But in the short space of the last six\r\nto seven years, it has seen 21 peace-keeping operations.\r\nPeace-keeping expenditures have also risen dramatically\r\nfrom the 1986 figure of about $350 million to $3.4 billion\r\nprojected for 1994.\r\nInternational relations have for a long time been\r\nconducted in an inter-State system, with the overriding\r\nprinciple being respect of the sovereignty of independent\r\nnations. The main focus of the United Nations Charter\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nwas and is on how the international community can respond\r\nto threats to peace and security issues between\r\nnation-States, as opposed to crises within a State. The\r\nworld community and the United Nations in particular have\r\nrelatively little experience to draw upon in managing\r\nintra-State conflicts and intra-State peace-keeping. The\r\ndilemmas faced by the Security Council in dealing with\r\nSomalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Rwanda, just to name a few,\r\ndemonstrate that the United Nations is still evolving its\r\napproach on how to respond to these challenges.\r\nThese new challenges of dealing with intra-State\r\nconflicts, it would appear, will continue to be with us. The\r\n1994 United Nations Development Programme report on the\r\nHuman Development Index indicates that 79 of the 82\r\nglobal military conflicts since 1991 were intra-State in\r\nnature. Can the United Nations, which represents the\r\nworld’s conscience, avoid getting involved in such\r\nconflicts? On the one hand, the United Nations is criticized\r\nfor not intervening in Rwanda in the earlier stages of the\r\ncivil war. It is argued that if it had, we could have avoided\r\nthe immense humanitarian disaster we now see in that\r\ncountry. On the other hand, others maintain that the United\r\nNations is not ready to shoulder the implied responsibility,\r\nafter getting involved in intra-State conflicts, of nursing a\r\ncountry back to the political stability and economic health\r\nwhich is, of course, necessary to prevent a repetition of\r\nfamine, chaos and other troubles.\r\nMember States are coming round to recognizing that\r\nthere are political, financial and institutional limitations to\r\nthe United Nations. We cannot realistically expect the\r\nUnited Nations to resolve all forms of civil wars within\r\nnational boundaries. For now, we have reverted to the\r\nmore onerous but perhaps sensible approach of responding\r\nto situations on a case by case basis. Inevitably, however,\r\nthe United Nations will need to establish guidelines and\r\ncriteria, either formal or otherwise, to decide where United\r\nNations involvement will be necessary and when it will be\r\neffective.\r\nThe Security Council already appears to have taken\r\nsteps in this direction. In a May 1994 statement, it agreed\r\nthat the existence of a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity, and of a clear political goal reflected in a precise\r\nmandate, are factors which should be considered when\r\nestablishing new peace-keeping operations. Other factors\r\nshould include, inter alia, whether a cease-fire exists and\r\nwhether the parties have committed themselves to a peace\r\nprocess intended to reach a political settlement.\r\nSignificantly, the Security Council also asked that it be\r\ninformed of the likely availability of resources for the new\r\noperations. These are but preliminary guidelines. It will\r\nbe necessary to build upon, refine and modify them to\r\nbest meet the evolving peace and security challenges of\r\nthis new era.\r\nIn many cases of intra-State conflicts, it is probably\r\nmore effective to address the underlying causes of conflict\r\nand provide a foundation for socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. The root causes of many conflicts are\r\nsocio-economic: the distribution of scarce resources and\r\nthe lack of development. Hence, we may do better to\r\nconcentrate on development aid, education, good\r\ngovernance and basic infrastructure-building to lay the\r\nbuilding-blocks to create a civil society. Where\r\nappropriate, these measures should be accompanied and\r\nsupplemented by preventive diplomacy. Peace-keeping\r\noperations are a palliative, not a substitute for solving the\r\nroot causes of conflicts.\r\nAt a time when the United Nations is called upon to\r\nundertake and adapt to new and complex leadership roles\r\nin international peace and security, the persistent financial\r\nproblems faced by our Organization have clearly to be\r\naddressed and overcome. The crucial point is that, having\r\ndecided to launch a peace-keeping operation, Member\r\nStates cannot allow it to fail, especially owing to lack of\r\nresources. The very credibility of our Organization would\r\nbe questioned if we were to mandate the United Nations\r\nto take on new peace-keeping operations, and then watch\r\nthem falter and fail because Member States are unwilling\r\nor unable to provide the requisite resources.\r\nUnfortunately, the Secretary-General had to again\r\nwarn the Presidents of the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly in July this year of the dire financial\r\nsituation of the United Nations, especially in peace-\r\nkeeping. Unless we do something, these warnings will be\r\nrepeated year after year. With the many multidimensional\r\nchallenges facing the United Nations in the post-cold-war\r\nera, it is difficult to envisage how the United Nations will\r\nbe able to carry out its functions effectively if it has to\r\nlive from hand to mouth in this manner. It is time\r\nMember States seriously addressed the issue of financial\r\nresources and tackled it firmly once and for all.\r\nThere is only one solution to the financial crisis of\r\nthe United Nations: Member States must pay their\r\nassessments in full and on time. Without our payments,\r\nthe United Nations simply cannot function.\r\nMany Member States have failed to honour the legal\r\nand binding obligations that require them to pay their\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nassessments in full and on time. Obligatory and legitimate\r\npayments are unconditional and incumbent on all Member\r\nStates. In fact, individual Member States have no reason\r\nto withhold or threaten to withhold contributions to the\r\nUnited Nations, as each Member State has the opportunity\r\nto present and argue its case for or against any United\r\nNations activity. Each Member State also has the chance\r\nto scrutinize the budgetary implications of each decision\r\nand consequently to negotiate a consensus with other\r\nMember States as is the practice for all budgetary matters.\r\nBut this is by now a tired mantra. In order to\r\nencourage timely payments, Member States should consider\r\nproposals already being discussed in United Nations circles,\r\nsuch as a system of charging interest on late payments,\r\nthough with due consideration for the difficult situations of\r\nthe least developed countries. We would also like to\r\nsuggest that Member States use the symbolic event of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to clear their\r\narrears and start with a clean slate financially. Member\r\nStates could undertake a joint commitment to pay up all\r\ntheir outstanding contributions to the United Nations before\r\nthis symbolic day in 1995.\r\nThe Security Council has a particularly critical role in\r\nthe United Nations. The Charter confers upon it the\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. As spelt out in the Charter, the\r\nmembership dues of a State Member of the United Nations\r\nare one of the few and most basic of the obligations of\r\nUnited Nations membership. Now, if a permanent member\r\nof the Security Council cannot even meet this basic\r\nobligation, how can it meet the heavy and serious\r\nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity on behalf of all Member States? We must\r\nestablish the principle that the permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council, with their privileged positions, should not\r\nbe in arrears. They should in fact set an example for the\r\nrest of the United Nations membership in meeting their\r\nfinancial obligations. For the same reason, permanent\r\nmembers must continue to bear special responsibilities in\r\nthe financing of peace-keeping.\r\nI hope Member States will consider our proposals\r\nseriously. I believe these proposals can lead to concrete\r\nresults in improving the financial situation of the United\r\nNations and even lay the basis for the United Nations better\r\nto manage the difficult challenges of this new era.\r\nSingapore is fully committed to working together with the\r\nSecretary-General and Member States to resolve the\r\nfinancial crisis of the United Nations.\r\nIt is expected that, with the rising costs for peace-\r\nkeeping operations, one of the most heated arguments in\r\nthe years ahead will be the apportionment of peace-\r\nkeeping expenses among Member States. Singapore will\r\nstrive, together with other Member States, to work out\r\nobjective political and economic criteria for improving the\r\nscale. It is clear that any ad hoc, arbitrary or voluntary\r\nmeasures in this regard will have little chance of success\r\ngiven the fact that this is a highly sensitive issue. There\r\nmust be a process of debate and discussion, however\r\nprotracted it may be, before we can arrive at a consensus\r\non a new scale. Singapore, for its part, is ready to pay\r\nmore in peace-keeping expenses provided, first, that this\r\nis the outcome of an overall reform of the peace-keeping\r\nscale and, secondly, that the problem of those who are in\r\narrears is seriously addressed.\r\nWe have come a long way since the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations 49 years ago. It is now time for us to\r\nrededicate ourselves to the goal of creating a better world,\r\nas envisaged by our Charter. What better time than now,\r\non the eve of our fiftieth anniversary, for us to place the\r\nUnited Nations on a sound financial footing and lay the\r\nfoundation for it to embark on its programmes and\r\nactivities for the next 50 years?\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Denmark, His Excellency Mr. Niels\r\nHelveg Petersen.\r\nMr. Petersen (Denmark): The unique role of the\r\nUnited Nations is to promote the well-being of people, the\r\nsecurity and development of nations and the protection of\r\nour common world. It was built on a resolve to maintain\r\npeace and security and to employ international machinery\r\nfor the promotion of the economic and social\r\nadvancement of all peoples.\r\nThe United Nations peace-keeping activities are a\r\nchallenge for all nations. For Denmark, it is a matter of\r\nthe highest priority. The United Nations can rely on\r\nDenmark to respond swiftly and efficiently to the needs\r\nof the Organization for troops, civilian police, customs\r\nofficials and personnel for humanitarian relief operations.\r\nWe have made organizational arrangements to make this\r\npossible, even at very short notice. A recent example is\r\nDenmark’s decision to contribute civilian personnel to\r\nengage in a humanitarian effort and to promote human\r\nrights in Haiti.\r\nWe favour a combination of peace-keeping\r\noperations with humanitarian relief operations. The\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nestablishment of the United Nations stand-by forces will\r\nenhance the ability to respond quickly to emerging crises.\r\nDenmark is ready to participate with further elements and\r\nis establishing an international brigade for that purpose.\r\nPeace-keeping has its own special features. They are\r\ndifferent from traditional military training. Peace-keepers\r\nmust consistently act in full accordance with their role and\r\nmandate. As has recently been said, patience, persistence\r\nand pressure are key elements of peace-keeping missions.\r\nSeventy-three nations today contribute troops, military\r\nobservers or civilian police to the many ongoing operations.\r\nThe number of troop-contributing nations is increasing.\r\nThis has placed emphasis on the need for training.\r\nDenmark stands ready to share its vast experience and\r\nknowledge in peace-keeping training and requirements.\r\nThe cooperation between the Baltic States, the Nordic\r\ncountries and the United Kingdom on a Baltic\r\npeace-keeping battalion is a good example of such\r\ncooperation. At present, a Lithuanian platoon is serving in\r\nthe Danish battalion in Croatia.\r\nKeeping the peace worldwide is costly. Funds are\r\nlimited, as is the number of trained and equipped troops.\r\nIn the future we must utilize preventive diplomacy. In\r\nMacedonia, we have seen the positive effects of the first\r\nexample of preventive deployment.\r\nCommunication between the Security Council and the\r\ntroopcontributing countries is imperative. Further progress\r\nis needed on this, for instance in the form of regular\r\nconsultations between the members of the Security Council,\r\nthe troop-contributing States and the Secretariat.\r\nPeace-keeping involves the important question of\r\nsafety and security for United Nations and associated\r\npersonnel. Peace-keepers act as a neutral force. They must\r\nbe ensured the highest possible standard of protection.\r\nAttacks cannot be tolerated. We strongly support the\r\nefforts of the United Nations to draft a legally binding\r\ntreaty in this field.\r\nThe \"Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277) led to discussions\r\non a more active role of the United Nations in peacemaking\r\nand peace-keeping. It is to be hoped that the \"Agenda for\r\nDevelopment\" (A/49/935) will inspire an equally important\r\ndiscussion on the role of the United Nations in\r\ndevelopment. Development policies must correspond to\r\nprevailing social, economic, environmental, religious and\r\nethnic problems.\r\nWe cannot fight tomorrow’s battles with yesterday’s\r\nweapons.\r\nMy Government is proud to host the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development in Copenhagen in March 1995.\r\nThe challenge of the Summit, the first of its kind, is to\r\ncreate new foundations of peace through development. It\r\npresents a unique chance to overcome the North-South\r\ndivide through new approaches. We must eradicate\r\npoverty and enable all people to earn a livelihood. We\r\nmust promote social integration by fostering just, safe and\r\nstable societies with the full participation of all people.\r\nDiscrimination in all its forms must be eliminated and\r\nhuman rights respected, and conditions for children and\r\nyoung people must be improved.\r\nAs a link to the Beijing Conference on Women, the\r\nSummit must make a strong commitment to achieving full\r\nequality between men and women and to enhancing the\r\ncontribution of women to social progress and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nProgress has been achieved in the preparatory\r\nprocess for the Summit, but this process is still marked by\r\ndifficulties. Time for preparation is running short. The\r\nSecretary-General is making untiring efforts to promote\r\nthe Copenhagen Summit and to secure its success. It is\r\nessential that Member States support the\r\nSecretary-General in his endeavours in order to keep up\r\nthe momentum of the process. The Summit represents an\r\nopportunity for world leaders to commit themselves and\r\ntheir Governments to a better and more just world.\r\nMembers may rest assured that, as hosts of the\r\nSummit, we will spare no effort to make it a success.\r\nWe are very much looking forward to welcoming Heads\r\nof State or Government in Copenhagen.\r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights in 1993\r\nwas a turning-point in United Nations activities for the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights. It is gratifying\r\nto see one of its central recommendations implemented in\r\nthe form of the establishment of the post of High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. Steps should now be\r\ntaken to increase substantially the resources for the United\r\nNations human rights programme. We must enable the\r\nHigh Commissioner to discharge his mandate in full.\r\nHuman rights are a vital element in preventing and\r\nresolving conflicts. We must therefore develop new\r\napproaches to monitoring human rights. One such step\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\ncould be to set up a team of human rights monitors to assist\r\nthe High Commissioner.\r\nFreedom of expression is a basic human right. The\r\nfatwa against Salman Rushdie and others constitutes a\r\nflagrant violation of this right. We urge the Iranian\r\nGovernment to dissociate itself from this threat.\r\nIncreasingly we realize that our actions or our\r\nnegligence as individual nations affect other nations and\r\ntheir populations. All nations have a common future that\r\nwe must protect from nuclear disasters, environmental\r\ndegradation and weapons of mass destruction.\r\nChernobyl taught us how important this aspect of\r\nsecurity is. It is of great concern to my Government that\r\nmany nuclear facilities in Central and Eastern Europe and\r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States are operating at\r\ncritically low levels of safety. We must improve this\r\nsituation.\r\nThe Rio de Janeiro Conference in 1992 put renewed\r\nemphasis on environment and development. Denmark’s\r\nresolve to abide by the Rio principles is strong. Our\r\ninternational development assistance of 1 per cent of gross\r\nnational product (GNP) is guided by the principles of\r\nsustainable development. This will provide additional\r\nfinancial resources to developing countries and countries in\r\ntransition in order to assist them in meeting objectives of\r\nsustainability.\r\nOur common future also calls for taking steps towards\r\ndisarmament, arms control and confidence-building\r\nmeasures. It implies reducing weapons of mass destruction,\r\nchemical and biological weapons as well as weapons to be\r\nused in outer space. We have reached a time that is\r\nconducive to these aims and to allowing the role of the\r\nUnited Nations to be enhanced.\r\nReform of the United Nations is necessary. Denmark\r\nsupports a strong Security Council. We agree that the\r\nCouncil needs to be adapted to today’s world and that it\r\nneeds to be enlarged. In enlarging the Council, priority\r\nshould be given to additional seats for non-permanent\r\nmembers, allocated under the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution. A small number of new seats\r\ncould be allocated as permanent seats.\r\nWe entrust the United Nations with mandates to secure\r\nworldwide peace, security and development, but we fail to\r\nensure the Organization the necessary financial means. It\r\nis not tenable, for instance, that troop-contributing nations\r\ncannot be reimbursed, and I simply fail to understand\r\nhow some Member States can advocate United Nations\r\nactions, including peace-keeping operations, and then\r\nrefuse to pay the bill.\r\nDenmark welcomes the withdrawal of the last troops\r\nof the former Soviet Union from Estonia and Latvia on\r\n31 August, in accordance with concluded agreements.\r\nThis is truly a historic event. It is of significance to\r\nfuture relations between the Baltic States and Russia, to\r\nstability in the Baltic area and for European security. The\r\nagreements must now be fully implemented by all parties\r\nin order to keep up the momentum.\r\nAs for the former Yugoslavia, important results have\r\nbeen reached since the establishment of the Contact\r\nGroup. The decision by the authorities of the former\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia to close the Serbian-Bosnian\r\nborder and to accept international surveillance is a direct\r\nconsequence of pressure by the international community.\r\nThe continued negative reaction to the peace plan of\r\nthe Bosnian Serbs must lead to their further isolation.\r\nSanctions remain one of the most efficient instruments in\r\nour policy of isolation. We therefore welcome the\r\nadoption of resolution 942 (1994) by the Security Council\r\nlast week.\r\nAgainst that background, we welcome the deferral of\r\nthe question of lifting the arms embargo. Denmark firmly\r\nbelieves that the arms embargo should not be lifted, as\r\nthis would entail risks of the conflict’s spreading. It\r\nwould disrupt the peace negotiations, which combine the\r\nefforts of the United Nations, the European Union, the\r\nUnited States and Russia, and it would make the\r\ncontinued presence of the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) impossible.\r\nUNPROFOR is playing an indispensable role in\r\nattempting to keep the peace and at the same time\r\nalleviate the plight of the people. With 1,400 troops,\r\ncivilian police and monitors in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nDenmark is one of the largest troop contributors to\r\nUNPROFOR. We remain committed to our participation\r\nin this operation.\r\nWe believe that a strict and effective sealing off of\r\nthe border between Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina will be a new and decisive element. At\r\nshort notice Denmark sent observers for the Mission of\r\nthe International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia\r\n(ICFY) to monitor that border.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nDenmark continues to make substantial contributions\r\nto the humanitarian relief work in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nCoordination by the United Nations and the European\r\nUnion is progressing favourably. Denmark is placing both\r\npersonnel and financial means at the disposal of that\r\nenterprise.\r\nWe strongly condemn the renewed \"ethnic cleansings\"\r\nwhich the Serbs have systematically carried out. The\r\npersons responsible for these atrocities must be brought\r\nbefore the international tribunal set up for the punishment\r\nof crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nIn the Middle East political will and hard negotiations\r\nhave created a historic breakthrough. Denmark warmly\r\nwelcomes the signing of the Declaration of Principles\r\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\n(PLO) in 1993 and the Declaration signed between Israel\r\nand Jordan in 1994. The Gaza-Jericho Agreement was the\r\nnext important step. International support is now needed to\r\nkeep up the momentum.\r\nThe holding of fair and free elections in Gaza and the\r\nWest Bank will represent significant progress. We\r\nencourage the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli\r\nGovernment to ensure speedy implementation of the\r\nelection process.\r\nProgress should also be achieved in the negotiations\r\nbetween Syria and Israel and between Lebanon and Israel.\r\nWe welcome the clear political will of all parties to\r\ncontinue their efforts to bring about such progress. They\r\nall stand to gain significantly from peace, and the United\r\nNations continues to have an important role to play.\r\nThe tragic events in Rwanda revealed the weakness of\r\nthe United Nations and of the international community. It\r\nwas demonstrated that we were not able to provide an\r\neffective and timely response. The challenge remains to\r\ncreate stability and ensure Rwanda the proper conditions for\r\ndevelopment. This will require an international effort on a\r\nconsiderable scale, which can be successful only if it is\r\nfirmly rooted in Rwanda and the countries of the region.\r\nOn the African scene it is heartening to see the\r\nRepublic of South Africa reinstated in its seat in the\r\nAssembly. It is now fully participating in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations. South Africa has proved to the world that\r\na peaceful transition from repression to democracy is\r\npossible. It has set an example. This also confirms that\r\nthe United Nations has a role to play in bringing about\r\nfundamental reforms in a repressive society.\r\nDenmark has been a staunch supporter of the forces\r\nof democratic change in South Africa. We will continue\r\nour considerable financial support to the consolidation of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThe best contribution of Member States to the\r\nUnited Nations is to reconfirm their will to implement the\r\nCharter, to accelerate the reform process and, indeed, to\r\npay their dues. The United Nations is, and must continue\r\nto be, a vital instrument in the service of the peoples of\r\nthe world.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Guatemala, Her Excellency Mrs.\r\nGladys Marithza Ruiz Sánchez de Vielmán.\r\nMrs. Ruiz Sánchez de Vielmán (Guatemala)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): Allow me to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth regular session and to offer\r\nyou the fullest cooperation of the Guatemalan delegation\r\nin the important tasks before you. I also wish to express\r\ndeserved appreciation to Ambassador Samuel Insanally\r\nfor the manner in which he discharged his duties as\r\nPresident during the last session. The Latin American\r\nand Caribbean region is justifiably proud of his\r\nperformance.\r\nI wish also to convey our appreciation to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his skilful\r\nhelmsmanship of the activities of the Organization. We\r\nagain offer him our support in his endeavours.\r\nIn the light of the great changes that have taken\r\nplace in recent years, we come to this Assembly full of\r\nhope and expectation. In some regions of the world\r\nevents make it possible for us to look ahead with\r\noptimism to a future of peaceful coexistence between\r\nnations. At the same time, in other regions we look with\r\nconcern on the inflammation of new hotbeds of tension\r\nthat lead to a weakening of the power of the State as the\r\ncatalyst among various social sectors. This situation\r\nseriously threatens the social fabric and the very norms\r\nthat make it possible for human beings to live together in\r\npeace.\r\nAs far as Guatemala is concerned, international\r\nrelations must be grounded in profound respect for the\r\nprinciples and norms of international law. Peaceful\r\ncoexistence can be achieved only by means of absolute\r\nrespect for the sovereignty, independence and legal\r\nequality of States.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nMultilateralism has been given new impetus in the\r\nnew international context and constitutes a more intense,\r\nmore comprehensive contribution to the search for solutions\r\nto problems old and new. To the extent that we place our\r\nfaith in multilateral action and are able to define it properly\r\nand efficiently, we will be able to move forward in\r\ndeveloping a stable international order that enables us to\r\nfoster peace and well-being for mankind. Within this\r\ninternational landscape, which has also transformed the\r\nconcept of global security, we face the challenge of\r\nunderstanding and coping with the new risks looming over\r\nmankind.\r\nGuatemala is at a moment of special importance in its\r\nhistory. Still fresh are the historic and unprecedented\r\nevents in which the people of Guatemala organized and\r\nmobilized and demonstrated its profound democratic\r\nconvictions, making it possible to restore constitutional\r\norder, which had broken down, and carrying the former\r\nhuman rights prosecutor to the presidency.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe background of our President Leon Carpio is well\r\nknown and constitutes the best guarantee of the\r\ncommitment and determination of the Government of\r\nGuatemala to struggle for the full enjoyment of human\r\nrights and the search for peace through dialogue and\r\nnegotiation. The Government has amply demonstrated its\r\npolitical will through concrete actions aimed at resolving a\r\nvery broad and complex range of problems. It has done so\r\nby pursuing an economic, social and cultural policy that\r\ntakes into account the multicultural nature of our country,\r\nincluding proposals from civilian society, which naturally\r\ninclude those emanating from the indigenous population of\r\nGuatemala.\r\nOur commitment to human rights has also been\r\nunquestionably strengthened by the important progress\r\nmade in the peace negotiations with the Unidad\r\nRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) with a\r\nview to ending one of the lengthiest armed conflicts in\r\nLatin America. Among the elements of progress made in\r\nthe negotiations, the Comprehensive Agreement on Human\r\nRights, with international validity and verification, is of\r\nparticular importance.\r\nIn the process of negotiations, the following\r\nagreements have been signed this year: the Framework\r\nAgreement for the Resumption of the Negotiating Process,\r\nsigned in Mexico on 10 January 1994, which provides for\r\nall agreements to include national and international\r\nverification mechanisms and that the United Nations be\r\nresponsible for the international ones; the Agreement on\r\na Timetable for the Negotiation of a Firm and Lasting\r\nPeace; the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights\r\nsigned in Mexico on 29 March 1994; the Agreement\r\nconcerning the resettlement of displaced persons, signed\r\nin Oslo on 17 July 1994; the Agreement on the\r\nCommission of Inquiry, signed in Oslo on 23 June 1994.\r\nAll Guatemalans and the international community\r\nare fully aware of the firm resolve of the Government to\r\nnegotiate responsibly and with determination to achieve\r\npeace agreements within the agreed timetable. The\r\npatience and flexibility of the Government of Guatemala\r\nare well known and have made it possible to reach\r\nagreement despite many difficulties. The representatives\r\nof the countries in the Group of Friends - Mexico,\r\nColombia, Spain, Norway, the United States and\r\nVenezuela - can testify to this.\r\nThe Framework Agreement and the Timetable\r\nestablish the parametres for negotiations, limiting both\r\nparties to a certain format and time-frame. The\r\nmoderator convenes meetings in accordance with the\r\nTimetable and the parties attend and negotiate in\r\nconformity with the established procedures. These are the\r\nagreed rules and no party can capriciously change them,\r\nmuch less try to usurp the function of verifying\r\ncompliance with the Comprehensive Agreement on\r\nHuman Rights. Full compliance with that Agreement is\r\nto be verified by a machinery requested of the United\r\nNations by both parties. On this basis, the mandate of the\r\nmission known as the United Nations Human Rights\r\nVerification Mission in Guatemala was established by\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution. My country would like to\r\nthank the international community, the Group of Friends\r\nand the United Nations for their assistance in the quest\r\nfor peace.\r\nIt is clear that fundamental rights and freedoms,\r\npolitical democracy and the right to development are\r\nindivisible and interdependent. Those countries like ours\r\nthat have experienced the tragedy of armed conflict know\r\nfrom experience that there are other, broader connotations\r\nto the right to development and that it is not possible to\r\nhave development and social evolution without peace. At\r\nthe same time, the full enjoyment of human rights is not\r\npossible without development or peace. The international\r\ncommunity has been firm and decisive in its political\r\nsupport for democratic processes. We have to believe\r\nthat it will pursue this course in seeking to strengthen and\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nrefine them. Regrettably, however, the processes involved\r\nin national reconciliation have not been understood, and\r\nsupport for the processes of development has been\r\ninsignificant; worse yet, development has been blocked,\r\nthus impeding access to sources of finance and to\r\ninternational markets.\r\nIf the development model and reconciliation are\r\nallowed to fail, democracy will fail too and we shall never\r\nachieve secure and lasting peace, because if the population\r\nloses faith in the democratic system we shall inevitably\r\nreturn to authoritarianism. The international community has\r\nthe responsibility to support economic and social\r\ndevelopment and to foster the processes of reconciliation if\r\nit would have all the nations of the world living under\r\ndemocracy. International condemnation and pressure might\r\nbe effective in fostering democracy, but they are not\r\nsufficient in and of themselves to establish it on a solid and\r\nlasting footing.\r\nThe Government of Guatemala reiterates its policy of\r\nwide-ranging cooperation with the United Nations system\r\nin the field of human rights. It has also demonstrated to\r\nthe international community its readiness to negotiate peace\r\nagreements within the scheduled timetable. It hopes that,\r\nin the face of a refusal by the URNG to return to the\r\nnegotiating table or to disarm and demobilize itself after its\r\nnon-binding signature, that party’s sources of finance will\r\nbe closed off to prevent armed action that would be totally\r\nunwarranted. The people of Guatemala has shown itself to\r\nbe a champion of democracy and dedicated to its\r\nimprovement. We urge the other party to recognize that its\r\nintegration into legitimacy by means of negotiation is the\r\nonly feasible course that would allow it to participate in the\r\nbuilding of a new Guatemala.\r\nGuatemalans believe that the authority of the State\r\nshould be based on the mandate of its people, that any\r\nGovernment must act with the consent of the majority of\r\nthe governed, and that the voice of the people must be\r\nheard in the formulation and implementation of government\r\npolicy. As far as we are concerned, these are vital and\r\nfundamental components of democracy. We understand\r\nthat there may be differences of opinion as to the form of\r\nthe people’s expression of this mandate and its participation\r\nin the various political forums of the State. We also\r\nbelieve that no State has the right to impose its political\r\nsystem on any other.\r\nFor us, the fundamental characteristics of the system\r\nshould be the legitimacy of the people’s mandate, the\r\nauthenticity of its consent to be governed and the\r\neffectiveness of its participation. Similarly, democracy\r\nbetween States requires strict and meticulous respect for\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nGuatemala participates with the Central American\r\ncountries in a process of regional integration that has\r\nundergone institutional renewal. We consider integration\r\nto be a process deeply rooted in our common history and\r\nculture and an instrument of momentous importance for\r\nthe development of our peoples.\r\nFor this reason, together with the other countries of\r\nthe region, we are pursuing important initiatives such as\r\nthe Alliance for Sustainable Development, whose\r\nprinciples are based on improving the quality of life of\r\nour peoples, respect for and development of the diverse\r\npotential and vitality of the Earth in a sustainable manner,\r\nthe promotion of peace and democracy as basic forms of\r\nhuman coexistence and respect for human rights and the\r\nmulticultural and multi-ethnic nature of our region.\r\nFurthermore, Guatemala is active in other regional\r\ninitiatives, such as the forthcoming ecological Summit in\r\nNicaragua and the International Conference on Peace and\r\nDevelopment, which will take place in Honduras. Both\r\nof these events are part of the region’s endeavours to\r\npromote economic and social development in Central\r\nAmerica.\r\nIn connection with the territorial dispute over Belize,\r\nthe Government of Guatemala will now be assisted by a\r\ncouncil made up of distinguished citizens, whose advice\r\nwill make it possible to define and give impetus to the\r\nprocedure for solving this dispute in the framework of the\r\nposition, well-known to the international community, that\r\nis set forth in document A/49/94 of 14 March this year.\r\nThe Government of Guatemala reiterates its\r\nreadiness to continue direct discussions with the\r\nGovernments of Belize and the United Kingdom, in\r\nconformity with the norms established for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes, in order to arrive at a definitive\r\nsolution to the territorial dispute that exists between our\r\nStates, a position that Guatemala has unswervingly and\r\nconstantly upheld.\r\nGuatemala wishes to reiterate its support for and\r\nsolidarity with the people of Haiti, reaffirming its\r\ncommitment to democracy and consequently to the\r\nlegitimately elected Government. In addition, it urges the\r\ninternational community to seek a lasting solution to the\r\nHaitian crisis that would set out not merely to restore\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\ndemocracy but also to meet the basic needs of the\r\npopulation.\r\nMy country feels bound to express its wish to see in\r\nCuba a peaceful transition to a democratic and pluralistic\r\nregime. At the same time, we wish to express our\r\ngratification at the new possibilities for dialogue that have\r\nbeen developed in connection with the situation in that\r\ncountry.\r\nWe also wish to mention our satisfaction with the\r\nagreements reached between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and between Israel and Jordan.\r\nThese represent a momentous step forward in the quest for\r\na solution to one of the most complex regional conflicts.\r\nSuch agreements are unquestionably proof that peaceful\r\ncoexistence and understanding among States and nations is\r\npossible, even in certain parts of the world where walls of\r\nhostility and mistrust have been built up over the years.\r\nWe hail all the peoples of that region and call on them to\r\ncontinue in their efforts to build peace.\r\nAlongside these positive actions, we feel duty-bound\r\nto voice our profound concern at the events that have taken\r\nplace in Rwanda. International cooperation must be\r\ngenerously channelled to that country. It should be\r\nregarded as part of an integrated effort to assist its\r\nGovernment in the difficult process of rebuilding the State\r\nwith a view to ensuring that it is effective in tackling the\r\nserious problems still persisting in the country.\r\nWe also share the concerns about the situation in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The international community\r\nmust continue in its efforts to convince the parties to the\r\nconflict of the imperative need to find an appropriate\r\nsolution that will put an end to this irrational conflict. This\r\nconflict cannot be allowed to become a permanent situation.\r\nGuatemala is a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural country,\r\nand it views with great satisfaction the international\r\ninstruments that are being developed with a view to\r\nintegrating indigenous peoples into development.\r\nConsistent with the precepts of our Magna Carta, the\r\nGovernment is pursuing policies designed to recognize,\r\nrespect and encourage their lifestyles, customs, traditions,\r\nsocial organization, languages and dialects, while also\r\nproviding protection to indigenous agricultural lands and\r\ncooperatives.\r\nWith respect to the question of women, I should\r\nunderscore that the policy of the Government has been to\r\ncooperate with other sectors of Guatemalan society in order\r\nto pursue measures designed to expand the scope for\r\nparticipation by women in the productive process and in\r\ndecision-making. Within the structure of the State itself,\r\nthere is an ever-growing number of women holding high\r\npositions, at the same time bearing a share in major\r\nresponsibilities relating to the building of a prosperous\r\nfuture for our society. At the same time, Government\r\naction is designed to strengthen mechanisms designed to\r\nprotect women, mechanisms which are in conformity with\r\nthe resolutions adopted by this Organization designed to\r\nadvance the rights of women.\r\nTurning now to attention given to children, the\r\nGovernment is fostering joint activities with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in the private sector with a\r\nview to combating drug addiction, illiteracy, malnutrition,\r\nabandonment and other problems of children.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development offers us\r\nan opportunity to tackle development as a priority of the\r\ninternational community and to redress the inequities that\r\nare increasingly widening between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries. The progress that has been\r\nachieved in the course of the work of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee must be further pursued, achieving the\r\nconsensus needed for the adoption of the draft declaration\r\nand the programme of action.\r\nThe common interests of the developing world must\r\nfind reflection in the agendas of international forums and\r\nagencies. To this end, mutual cooperation is the proper\r\nvehicle, and the coordination endeavours of the\r\ndeveloping countries among themselves should be stepped\r\nup.\r\nGuatemala has acceded to the international\r\ninstruments designed to eradicate drug trafficking. The\r\npresent Government attaches priority to combating this\r\nscourge. It goes without saying that we need solidarity\r\nand international cooperation in order to eradicate it.\r\nThe economies of the developing world have had to\r\nmake great efforts to adapt and open up to world markets,\r\nefforts which, in most cases, have had a high social cost.\r\nGuatemala takes the view that trading relations among\r\nStates need to be based on the free exchange of goods\r\nand services. We all need trade, and this makes it vital\r\nto break down the barriers placed in its way, in\r\naccordance with the spirit and principles of the World\r\nTrade Organization.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nAs a consequence of the changes taking place in the\r\ninternational arena, the United Nations has undertaken a\r\nprocess of restructuring in an attempt to respond to the new\r\nrequirements of international relations. Guatemala believes\r\nthere is a need to reform the world Organization, and in\r\nthis respect we support the revitalization of the Economic\r\nand Social Council, which would enable it to function in\r\nkeeping with present requirements. We are also in favour\r\nof establishing a better balance between the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Secretariat that\r\nwould allow the Assembly to play a more decisive role as\r\na forum for deliberation, negotiation and decision-making\r\non all global problems.\r\nIn this connection, Guatemala believes that the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council holds pride of place in\r\nthe process of reforming this Organization. During this\r\nprocess structures that emanated from and operated within\r\na world of confrontation should be reformed. The Security\r\nCouncil should be restructured with a view to achieving\r\nrepresentation that is proper and equitable and reflects the\r\ncurrent international situation.\r\nGuatemala notes with satisfaction the measures taken\r\nby the Secretary-General to adapt the Organization to the\r\nnew international environment and to equip it with the\r\nmeans to fulfil the objectives of the Charter. In this\r\nrespect, Guatemala has offered to participate in the\r\nformation of the stand-by forces.\r\nPeace-keeping operations are multiplying daily.\r\nNo one can deny that the role played by these forces in\r\ndealing with a very large number of conflicts has prevented\r\nthem from worsening and has allowed latitude for dialogue\r\nand negotiation. For this reason, they need to be given the\r\nappropriate means for carrying out their activities, which\r\nshould always be based on the consent of the parties\r\nconcerned so as to safeguard the sovereignty of States and\r\nrespect for their domestic jurisdiction. They should act on\r\nthe basis of clearly defined mandates and well-delineated\r\nfields of action.\r\nThe promotion of world peace should be one of the\r\ncentral issues addressed by this Organization. In this\r\ncontext, the limitation of arms production continues to be\r\nnecessary. All the resources used in weapons research and\r\ndevelopment should be released and used to promote the\r\nwell-being of our peoples. Nuclear disarmament should\r\nalso be one of the major objectives on the agenda of the\r\ninternational community in the coming years.\r\nFor this reason, and because of our peace-loving\r\ntradition, we shall continue to strive to ensure that at the\r\nmeeting of States parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons to be held in 1995 the\r\nTreaty’s validity should be extended indefinitely.\r\nThe ultimate aim of the contribution of each and\r\nevery one of our nations to this Organization is the\r\noverall development of the human being. All nations\r\nwish to see all their citizens enjoying the benefits of\r\ncomprehensive development. To achieve this there must\r\nbe cooperation between all the nations of the Earth.\r\nMy Government therefore is very pleased to\r\nassociate itself with the cordial welcome extended by the\r\nOrganization to South Africa on the occasion of its\r\nreintegration into the United Nations, as well as to the\r\nnew Observers, especially the Sovereign Military Order\r\nof Malta, whose humanitarian impact on the world has\r\nbeen of great importance.\r\nThis gives full validity to the principle of\r\nuniversality, which should prevail in the United Nations.\r\nAnd this belief prompts us to touch on the question of a\r\ncountry which is capable of making a significant\r\ncontribution to the search for solutions to the problems\r\nthat the nations of the world must face. The entry of the\r\nRepublic of China, Taiwan, into the United Nations\r\nwould strengthen the Organization, permitting and\r\nencouraging it to deal properly with topics with global\r\nimplications.\r\nGuatemala reaffirms its firm and resolute\r\ndetermination to meet the commitments and\r\nresponsibilities it has undertaken in relation to its own\r\npeople and the international community, in order to assist\r\nin building a fairer, more peaceful and developed\r\nworld.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan, His Excellency\r\nMr. Najibullah Lafraie, and I call on him.\r\nMr. Lafraie (Afghanistan): It gives me great\r\npleasure to convey on behalf of the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan our warm felicitations to Mr. Amara Essy on\r\nhis unanimous election to the high office of President of\r\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The\r\nAfghan delegation assures him of its full cooperation\r\nduring his term of office.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nI cannot fail to express the gratitude of the Afghan\r\ndelegation for the effective leadership shown by\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, the President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session, in guiding the\r\nproceedings of that session.\r\nHis Excellency Professor Burhannudin Rabbani,\r\nPresident of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, has instructed\r\nme to convey to the Assembly a message he has addressed\r\nto it. I am privileged to read out that message now:\r\n\"Your Excellencies, Heads of State and\r\nGovernment participating in the forty-ninth session of\r\nthe General Assembly,\r\n\"His Excellency the Secretary-General,\r\n\"His Excellency the President of the General\r\nAssembly,\r\n\"I convey my best wishes for the prosperity,\r\nwelfare and progress of your nations, and wish the\r\nUnited Nations and the current General Assembly\r\nsession ever more success in furthering the cause of\r\npeace and social justice.\r\n\"I had desired to personally attend the current\r\nGeneral Assembly session and avail myself of the\r\nopportunity to meet and extend to you, and through\r\nyou to your Governments and peoples, the message of\r\nthe Islamic State and the Afghan nation. However,\r\nimportant State engagements, particularly some\r\nongoing developments concerning the consolidation of\r\nthe political process in my country, prevented me\r\nfrom doing so. Therefore, I have asked the Chairman\r\nof the Afghan delegation to convey this brief message\r\nto the General Assembly.\r\n\"This message raises the cry of a nation which,\r\nwith its unprecedented sacrifices, has played its\r\nhistoric role for the cause of world peace and stability\r\nand for the collapse of the hegemonistic and\r\nexpansionist system of the former Soviet Union, as\r\nwell as for the defence of freedom, social justice and\r\ndemocratic values. A nation which suffered more\r\nthan 1.5 million sacrifices and immeasurable\r\ndestruction in all spheres of its life has contributed to\r\nthe ending of the cold war and to a considerable\r\ndiminution of the threat of nuclear confrontation. It\r\nwas the ending of global polarization that enabled East\r\nand West to attain positive understandings that\r\nproduced assurances and trust leading to the\r\nestablishment of extensive cooperation and the\r\nrecognition of democracy as an accepted value and\r\nconcept, irrespective of any bloc interest.\r\n\"We are mindful of the fact that our friends are\r\nequally grieved as a result of the prevailing\r\nsufferings imposed upon our innocent nation. We\r\nappreciate their readiness to endeavour to find an\r\nend to those destructive events.\r\n\"I would like to make it known that as far as\r\nthe Islamic State is concerned, we have proved our\r\nsincerity and our dedication to a peaceful settlement\r\nof the present problems. To allow the political\r\nprocess to consolidate, I have announced my\r\nreadiness to transfer power to a responsible and\r\nlegitimate authority. I have even declared that I\r\nwould not be a candidate during the transitional\r\nperiod.\r\n\"It is the warmonger elements who have taken\r\nadvantage of our flexibility and conciliatory\r\ngestures, including our unilateral cease-fire\r\ndeclarations, to strengthen their political and military\r\npositions and please their outside supporters with\r\nmoves towards the realization of their heinous\r\ndesigns. These are elements whose merciless rocket\r\nattacks on innocent civilian targets and the continued\r\nviolation of international humanitarian law are\r\nmatters of everyday life.\r\n\"The Afghan nation is astonished to continue to\r\nsee a lack of adequate enthusiasm on the part of the\r\nworld community to act effectively towards the\r\nrealization of the following legitimate aspirations:\r\n\"First, an extensive collective endeavour to provide\r\nrealistic and effective assistance to accelerate the\r\nongoing political process inside the country;\r\n\"Secondly, an immediate start of practical assistance\r\nfor the reconstruction and rehabilitation of war-torn\r\nAfghanistan, as well as mine clearance, to facilitate\r\nand speed up the repatriation of Afghan refugees;\r\n\"Thirdly, effective international measures to stop\r\nforeign interference, particularly in the form of the\r\nsupply of weapons and ammunition to those who\r\ncontinue to cause immeasurable loss of life and\r\ndestruction of property.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\n\"Finding a solution to the existing problems of\r\nAfghanistan necessitates the taking of realistic and\r\ncourageous action by the world community, the United\r\nNations and, in particular, the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil.\r\n\"We are confident that clear and decisive action\r\nin continuation of the support extended to us during\r\nour 14 years of struggle would enable the Afghan\r\nnation once again to live in peace, equality and\r\nbrotherhood, free from any form of racial, ethnic,\r\nlinguistic and religious prejudice. It is in such an\r\natmosphere of peace and tranquillity that Afghanistan\r\ncould play its positive and effective role in the\r\nconsolidation of regional peace and stability as a\r\npositive element, defending democracy and social\r\njustice.\r\n\"As history recounts, a disturbed Afghanistan has\r\nalways been a source of regional instability, just as its\r\nstability has had a positive impact on the tranquillity\r\nof the region.\r\n\"It is expected that those concerned with peace in\r\nAfghanistan, especially our fraternal neighbouring\r\ncountries, will be supportive of the ongoing political\r\nprocess in our homeland.\r\n\"The tenets of Islam guide us towards honesty,\r\njustice and mutual respect among members of the\r\nhuman community, irrespective of any form of\r\nprejudice. Islam calls upon all Islamic nations to\r\nserve the cause of the peace and security of mankind.\r\n\"The United Nations, as a source of hope for\r\nmany suffering nations around the world, can play a\r\ndecisive role in the return of peace to our shattered\r\nand war-stricken country.\r\n\"We are appreciative of the personal efforts of\r\nHis Excellency the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations and the special mission under the leadership\r\nof His Excellency Mahmoud Mestiri. We also value\r\nthe efforts of His Excellency Mr. Hamid Algabid,\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, for his continuous search to put an end to\r\nthe conflict in Afghanistan. We wish them every\r\nsuccess in coordinating their efforts with our national\r\nendeavours based upon realistic approaches.\r\n\"Let us hope that our future generations will\r\nrecall the efforts of our friends and those interested in\r\na stable and peaceful Afghanistan as the continuation\r\nof our just struggle for the cause of peace.\r\n\"Wishing the current session of the General\r\nAssembly every success,\r\n\"Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani,\r\n\"President of the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan.\"\r\nLet me begin my own statement by referring to the\r\nmiseries being inflicted upon our people and country and\r\nby letting members of the Assembly know about some\r\nrecent political developments in Afghanistan.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly three\r\nmain political developments have taken place in our\r\nnational efforts aimed at further consolidation of the\r\npolitical process and in the international action in favour\r\nof peace and stability in Afghanistan:\r\nFirst, the completion of the first two rounds and the\r\nbeginning of a third round of peace efforts by the United\r\nNations special mission to Afghanistan;\r\nSecondly, consideration of the situation in our\r\ncountry by the Security Council;\r\nThirdly, major developments in the political process,\r\nhighlighted by the convening in August 1994 of a\r\nSupreme Islamic Council in Herat and by its significant\r\nresolutions.\r\nFollowing the first round of its visit to Afghanistan\r\nthe special mission submitted its report (A/49/208) to the\r\nSecretary-General. Before making some comments on\r\nthat report, I wish first to express the gratitude of the\r\nIslamic State of Afghanistan to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his personal concern and\r\nthe attention he continues to pay to Afghanistan. We\r\nassure him of our continued cooperation and support. I\r\nshould also like to reaffirm the commitment of the\r\nIslamic State to support the special mission and to\r\ncooperate with it to enable it to discharge its mandate\r\nsuccessfully.\r\nHere, I should like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to some elements in the report that are of\r\nparticularly importance. Paragraph 13 states that the\r\nmission found most of the country - at least two thirds of\r\nit - to be at peace. I would also draw attention to the\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nrealistic conclusion of the mission in paragraph 31, which\r\nstates, inter alia, that the\r\n\"mission believes that reconstruction assistance should\r\nnot be seen as separate from but integral to a lasting\r\npolitical solution.\" (A/49/208, para. 31)\r\nEmphasizing the interrelationship between political and\r\neconomic activities to promote peace, the report says:\r\n\"Political and economic activity are interrelated and\r\ninterconnected forces, which must be linked in\r\nAfghanistan in ways which encourage peace.\" (Ibid.)\r\nWe appreciate this positive assessment of the mission.\r\nIn the light of the above conclusions of the United\r\nNations mission as well as its recommendations, and based\r\nupon the critical need of the Afghan people for outside\r\nassistance, we believe the notion of peace first and\r\nreconstruction assistance second is no longer justifiable or\r\nplausible. The beginning of reconstruction assistance in\r\nthose parts of the country where peace prevails will\r\ncertainly encourage and persuade those who are illegally\r\ncarrying arms to abandon their weapons for shovels and\r\nbegin rebuilding their agriculture and farms.\r\nSince the beginning of the abortive coup of 1 January\r\nin Kabul, the United Nations Security Council has\r\nconsidered the situation in Afghanistan on three separate\r\noccasions. This consideration, which was in conformity\r\nwith the Afghan nation’s expectations of the Security\r\nCouncil, was timely and appropriate.\r\nIn its Presidential Statement dated 23 March 1994,\r\n\"The Council stress[ed] the importance that it\r\nattaches to full compliance with international\r\nhumanitarian law in all its aspects and recall[ed] that\r\nthose who violate international humanitarian law bear\r\nindividual responsibility.\" (S/PRST/1994/12)\r\nThat Statement was just, positive and realistic.\r\nRecently, another Security Council Presidential\r\nStatement, dated 11 August 1994, was issued in reference\r\nto certain developments including the progress report of the\r\nUnited Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan and the\r\nrecommendations therein. This Presidential Statement too\r\ncontains some positive, important and realistic elements, in\r\nparticular the fourth paragraph, wherein\r\n\"The Council calls on all States to take the\r\nnecessary steps to promote peace in Afghanistan, to\r\nstop the flow of weapons to the parties, and to put\r\nan end to this destructive conflict.\"\r\n(S/PRST/1994/43)\r\nThe Statement also urges the international\r\ncommunity to assist Afghans in rebuilding their shattered\r\ncountry.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan expressed its\r\nappreciation to the Council for addressing an important\r\naspect which is the core of the problem. However, we\r\nnote with astonishment the reluctance on the part of the\r\nCouncil to condemn the aggressors, who continue to\r\ninflict inhuman atrocities on innocent civilian populations\r\nand continue to violate international humanitarian law.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan once again states\r\nthat the present crisis in the country is not a civil war but\r\nrather an imposed armed conflict fueled from abroad.\r\nThe Security Council’s good intentions for\r\nAfghanistan can be realized only if the Council addresses\r\nthe actual cause of the fighting. It should not limit itself\r\nto the mere issuance of statements, but should consider\r\ntaking some specific enforcement measures.\r\nIn this connection, it would be appropriate to refer\r\nto resolution 48/75 H, adopted at the forty-eighth session\r\nof the General Assembly on 16 December 1993, on\r\nmeasures to curb the illicit transfer and use of\r\nconventional weapons. The Assembly, considering the\r\navailability of massive quantities of conventional weapons\r\nas a contributing factor to armed conflicts around the\r\nworld and recognizing the excessive quantity of\r\nconventional weapons in a number of countries as a\r\nsource of destabilization of their national and regional\r\nsecurity, invited Member States to take appropriate\r\nenforcement measures directed at ending the illegal export\r\nof these weapons from their territories.\r\nThe continued illegal flow of conventional weapons\r\nto Afghanistan represents a violation of the provisions of\r\nresolution 48/75 H by some of our neighbouring\r\ncountries. We hope that the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to the General Assembly at the current session,\r\nrequested by that resolution, will suggest effective ways\r\nand means of stopping the illegal flow of these weapons\r\nand of collecting weapons illegally distributed in the\r\ncountry.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nNow I should like to turn to the recent major political\r\ndevelopment which is a source of hope for bringing an end\r\nto the crisis in our country:\r\nAt the beginning, it would not be inappropriate to\r\ndraw the attention of this Assembly to the fact that the\r\ncurrent situation in Afghanistan is a legacy of 14 years of\r\nprotracted war stemming from the invasion unleashed by\r\nthe former Soviet Union, as well as of a series of\r\ninterferences in our internal affairs over the last two years.\r\nTo eliminate the manifestations and effects of such a\r\nprotracted war, which aimed at erasing all spiritual,\r\nhistorical and cultural values of Afghan society, is not\r\nfeasible in a short period of time.\r\nEarly last month on the initiative of the south and west\r\nzone of the country and its leader and general commander,\r\nGeneral Mohammad Ismail Khan, a Supreme Islamic\r\nCouncil convened in the ancient city of Herat, with the\r\nparticipation of more than 700 delegates representing\r\ndifferent strata of Afghan society, including governors and\r\nthe main commanders of various provinces, religious\r\nscholars, tribal leaders, technocrats, intellectuals and other\r\nscholars, as well as 150 representatives of Afghans living\r\nabroad. That important gathering was also attended by the\r\nrepresentative of the Office of the Secretary-General on\r\nAfghanistan and Pakistan as well as by a number of\r\nrepresentatives of friendly countries. At the end, the\r\nSupreme Islamic Council adopted an eleven-point\r\nresolution. Due to the important contribution the realization\r\nof the objectives of the said resolution would have in the\r\nconsolidation of peace and the political process in the\r\ncountry, I should like to take the liberty of shedding light\r\non some of its most important points.\r\nGiven the fact that on the basis of Islamic law and\r\ninternationally accepted principles, the will of a nation is\r\nthe source of national sovereignty, the Supreme Islamic\r\nCouncil decided:\r\n- To convene a traditional Grand National\r\nAssembly - Loya Jirgah - by the end of October 1994, in\r\nthe capital, Kabul, in order to determine the future political\r\nleadership of the country; adopt and ratify the future\r\nconstitution; and settle other important national issues yet\r\npending;\r\n- To reject and condemn any Government created\r\nagainst the will of the nation and under the patronage of\r\noutsiders;\r\n- Strongly to condemn foreign interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of Afghanistan, calling upon the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the United\r\nNations to act resolutely to put an end to that interference\r\non the basis of the provisions of their Charters;\r\n- To reaffirm the fact that Afghanistan is a\r\ndistinct and indivisible political entity.\r\nThe participating members of the Supreme Islamic\r\nCouncil in Herat committed themselves to standing firm\r\nagainst any rejection of this national accord. The full text\r\nof the Herat resolutions can be found in the official\r\ndocument of the Security Council (S/1994/943).\r\nIt is gratifying to note that based upon those\r\nresolutions, a preparatory commission for the Grand\r\nAssembly convened on 30 August in Kabul and at its first\r\nmeeting unanimously elected Mawlawi Mohammad Nabi\r\nMuhammadi, the leader of the Herakat-Inqalabi Islami\r\nparty, as its Chairman.\r\nGiven the fact that the resolutions adopted in Herat\r\nmarked a major new stage in the political evolution of our\r\ncountry, with the emphasis on the broad participation of\r\nAfghans, in that national gathering, and taking into\r\nconsideration the effective role that the special mission of\r\nthe United Nations could play in the acceleration of the\r\npeace process, it would be relevant to say a few words\r\nabout the need to coordinate and merge these two series\r\nof efforts into components of a unified political process.\r\nGuided by its mandate, the United Nations Special\r\nMission should try to find common ground with a view\r\nto ensuring a compromise approach that would lead to\r\nnational rapprochement among Afghans. We are fully\r\nconfident that Ambassador Mestiri will keep this in mind\r\nas the core of his mandate. If the Afghans, in keeping\r\nwith their traditional way of solving problems, come\r\ntogether in a national gathering and adopt resolutions\r\naimed at preserving the national sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity and at realizing the right of the people to decide\r\ntheir own political future without foreign interference and\r\ninvolvement, the United Nations will be left as a neutral\r\nparty with a complementary role.\r\nAs an additional measure, the United Nations Special\r\nMission could support an initiative that would avoid any\r\nloopholes and would ensure fairness and impartiality in\r\nthe proceedings. Otherwise, attempts to create a parallel\r\ninitiative will only produce further complication and\r\naggravation of the situation and, consequently,\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\ndisappointment for our nation in the peacemaking efforts of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI should like to make it clear that at no stage in its\r\nexistence has Afghanistan constituted a source of threat to\r\nits neighbours. Nor has it allowed any third country to use\r\nit for the advancement of that country’s political differences\r\nwith Afghanistan’s neighbours. We shall continue to act in\r\nthis manner. Today, we yearn for peace more than for\r\nanything else, for only in an atmosphere of peace can we\r\nstrive for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of our\r\nwar-shattered country and heal the wounds and relieve the\r\npain and suffering resulting from 14 years of war. We\r\nsincerely and seriously expect our neighbours to be\r\nsupportive of our national efforts to these ends.\r\nIn principle, the legitimate interests of States should be\r\nrecognized and respected by their neighbours. However, if\r\nthe expectation of a State, under the pretext of preserving\r\nits interests, violates the supreme interest of another State -\r\nnamely, its national sovereignty and territorial integrity and\r\nthe principle that the will of a nation should govern its\r\ndestiny - this expectation becomes illegitimate.\r\nNot too long ago the world witnessed the former\r\nSoviet Union, as it pursued its activities in Afghanistan,\r\ncrossing the boundary of legitimate interest. As a result,\r\nthe Afghan nation, without regard for the disparity between\r\nthe military means of the two sides, stood against one of\r\nthe world’s mightiest military machines. After 10 years of\r\nimposed war and direct confrontation with the Red Army,\r\nthe Afghan nation, with the help of the Almighty and the\r\nsacrifice of more than 1.5 million martyrs, proved once\r\nagain that it would never allow foreign interference or\r\naccept dictates - in particular, that it would not permit\r\noutsiders to impose their will on Afghans.\r\nThere is no longer a foreign army of occupation in\r\nAfghanistan, but the legacy of such a presence is still\r\nkilling our people. Land-mines constitute the most toxic\r\npollution facing mankind. Referred to as the hidden killers,\r\nthese do not discriminate between adults and children. If\r\nthere are 100 million of these deadly devices in 60 war-\r\nstricken countries throughout the world, at least one fifth of\r\nthem are in Afghanistan. This cruel threat is a dreadful\r\nimpediment to the return of the refugees.\r\nWe need a great deal of help from the international\r\ncommunity if we are to promote and finance land-mine\r\nawareness and clearance programmes. We appreciate\r\nhighly President Clinton’s very important proposal, voiced\r\nhere, concerning the need for international action to clear\r\nmines in the war-stricken countries of the world.\r\nNo international effort in the war against poverty\r\nand in support of sustained growth and development will\r\nbe effective if account if not taken of the continuing\r\ndeterioration in the socio-economic situation of the least\r\ndeveloped countries, identified as such by the United\r\nNations system. Among these countries are those that\r\nexperience frequent natural disasters and those ravaged by\r\nwar.\r\nSpecific action to deal with the particular needs and\r\nproblems of land-locked developing countries - I refer in\r\nparticular to assistance for the land-locked States of\r\ncentral Asia - is an important matter that requires\r\ndiscussion during this session of the General Assembly.\r\nAfghanistan, which is itself land-locked, is the country of\r\ntransit for many central Asian States. Roads and\r\nhighways in Afghanistan are damaged as a result of the\r\nlong years of foreign armed aggression. For this reason\r\nwe shall propose that the United Nations system assist our\r\nregion by carrying out a corridor study - a study of the\r\ntransit roads in Afghanistan, which is situated in the heart\r\nof Asia.\r\nTransit and transport agreements between the land-\r\nlocked States members of the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization, including Afghanistan, and Iran and\r\nPakistan need to be concluded or updated to take account\r\nof the new circumstances and the legal and technical\r\nadvice of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan stands firm in\r\nsupport of human rights throughout the world but\r\nparticularly in Afghanistan. Much to our regret, armed\r\nconflict between various groups has resulted in violations\r\nof human rights - especially of the right to life, which is\r\nhumanity’s most fundamental right. To prevent such\r\noccurrences and to ensure security, the State is\r\ndetermined to collect the arms currently in the possession\r\nof certain groups. There has already been noticeable\r\nprogress in this area. Most of the armed groups realize\r\nthe need to end conflicts and to relinquish heavy\r\narmaments. The completion of this task can be ensured\r\nthrough strengthening of the national armed forces and\r\nthe national police force. Significant steps will be taken\r\ntowards this goal.\r\nAs for civil, political, economic and cultural rights,\r\nthe Islamic State of Afghanistan, in observance of Islamic\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nteaching and international responsibilities, acknowledges its\r\nduty to eliminate all discrimination and intolerance, whether\r\nreligious, linguistic or based on gender. Afghanistan\r\nrecognizes its Islamic responsibility to ensure the family,\r\nlegal, cultural, social, political and economic rights of\r\nwomen. Apart from obligations of principle and morality,\r\na country that lost 15 per cent of its population during the\r\nwar cannot be completely successful in the enormous task\r\nof reconstruction without the active participation of its\r\nfemale population. Therefore, it is imperative that proper\r\nmeasures be taken to secure extensive participation by\r\nAfghan women in the process of rebuilding the nation’s\r\neconomy, culture and society.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIn the midst of these conflicts, it is the children who\r\nsuffer most. In Afghanistan alone there are almost 1\r\nmillion war orphans. The situation of this precious and\r\nmost vulnerable category of the population deserves\r\nparticular attention. To this end, the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan will submit a proposal for consideration by the\r\nAssembly at its current session to establish an international\r\nfund within the framework of the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF) to assist the rehabilitation of orphans of\r\narmed conflicts. It would be worth considering a\r\ndeclaration of 1996 as the international year of orphans.\r\nWe welcome the appointment of Graça Machel by the\r\nSecretary-General as an expert to carry out the mandate of\r\nthe General Assembly to conduct a study of the\r\nconsequences of armed conflicts on children.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan, inspired by Islamic\r\ninstructions, has no hesitation in taking a firm stand against\r\nterrorism in any shape or form. As we battle violence in\r\nour own land, we continue to add our voice to that of the\r\ninternational community in condemning terrorism the world\r\nover.\r\nAt its last session the General Assembly discussed in\r\nsome detail the plight of disabled people. However, the\r\npractical achievements do not seem to be adequate. From\r\nthis rostrum I remind the world community again of the\r\nstate of the nearly 2 million disabled persons in\r\nAfghanistan, victims of a war of aggression. We will\r\nsubmit proposals for securing international assistance for\r\nthe world’s disabled population in order to alleviate their\r\nsocial, economic and psychological problems.\r\nOne issue worth mentioning, with both regional and\r\ninternational implications, is that of narcotic drugs. The\r\nillicit cultivation, production, stocking, smuggling and\r\ntrafficking of narcotic drugs are undeniably critical\r\nproblems facing humanity today. Regrettably, one of the\r\nlegacies of the long war in Afghanistan is the\r\ntransformation of some parts of our country into staging\r\nareas for illicit drug activities. This phenomenon, which\r\nis partly the result of the unavailability of alternative\r\nproductive economic activities, is a source of great\r\nconcern to us. Afghanistan, despite its scarce resources,\r\nhas taken serious measures in the struggle against illicit\r\ndrugs. We will spare no effort to combat these illegal\r\nactivities. However, we must not overlook the reality that\r\nAfghanistan, with its extremely limited means and\r\nmassive economic and financial needs, is not in a position\r\neffectively to accomplish this task alone. Afghanistan\r\nneeds urgent support from the international community to\r\nintensify the struggle against drug cultivation and\r\ntrafficking.\r\nThe ongoing internal conflict in Tajikistan, a\r\nfraternal neighbour of Afghanistan, is a matter of\r\ncontinued concern to us. We hope that the brotherly\r\nTajik people, who are opening a new chapter in their\r\nhistory after the collapse of the former Soviet Union and\r\ntheir emergence as a new and independent nation, will\r\nsoon succeed in overcoming their difficulties.\r\nOne dimension of this internal conflict is the\r\nperiodic disturbances occurring on the border between\r\nAfghanistan and Tajikistan. As a result of the conflict\r\ninside Tajikistan, more than 100,000 Tajik refugees have\r\ntaken refuge inside Afghanistan. The Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan, on the basis of deep feelings of Islamic\r\nbrotherhood, humanitarian considerations and traditional\r\nAfghan hospitality, provided shelter to those refugees.\r\nThe influx of the Tajik refugees to Afghanistan is\r\ndue to the political circumstances in their own country.\r\nTherefore, only a political solution to the problems with\r\nwhich they are faced, with the Government of Tajikistan,\r\nwill guarantee their voluntary repatriation to their\r\nhomeland.\r\nThe dispatch of armed forces of the Russian\r\nFederation to Tajikistan, especially on the border between\r\nAfghanistan and Tajikistan, would in our view further\r\naggravate the problem rather than contribute to its\r\nsolution.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan has committed\r\nitself to supporting the peaceful initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his Special Envoy to Tajikistan, Ambassador\r\nPiriz-Ballon. As far as possible we have encouraged the\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nTajik refugee leaders, in a spirit of conciliation, to help\r\nUnited Nations efforts to succeed by agreeing to a\r\nnegotiated settlement. A chief factor in resolving the\r\nproblem will be the Tajik Government’s heeding the just\r\nand legitimate demands of the Tajik opposition leaders.\r\nAfghanistan, in pursuit of its previous commitments,\r\nis desirous that its border with Tajikistan should be a\r\nborder of peace, understanding and friendship. Once again\r\nwe would like to declare that periodic clashes on the border\r\nbetween Afghanistan and Tajikistan are a manifestation of\r\nthe internal conflict in Tajikistan, and not a single member\r\nof the Afghan armed forces is, or will be, involved in any\r\nborder clashes.\r\nAs everyone knows, in Bosnia and Herzegovina the\r\nodious and barbaric \"ethnic cleansing\" practised by the\r\nSerbs of Bosnia re-emerged a few weeks ago in Banja\r\nLuka, Bijeljina and other areas. The Security Council has\r\njust demanded - in resolution 941 (1994) of 23 September -\r\nthat the Bosnian Serb authorities immediately cease their\r\ncampaign of \"ethnic cleansing\". This demand of the\r\nSecurity Council is bound to be disregarded and denied by\r\nthe Bosnian Serb criminals. It is therefore imperative that\r\nthe Security Council should decide to mandate a United\r\nNations presence and coercive measures for the protection\r\nof the Bosnian communities threatened by further \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\". Otherwise, the United Nations and the five-\r\nPower Contact Group will lose all credibility.\r\nAnother dangerous area calls for the immediate\r\nattention of the Organization if we want to save the whole\r\nregion from catastrophe. The grave situation in Kosovo,\r\naggravated by the daily massive repression committed by\r\nthe Serbian authorities against 2 million ethnic Albanians,\r\nand referred to as a time-bomb, remains explosive. We\r\nalso remind the Assembly of human rights violations in\r\nSandjak.\r\nIt is our view that a special United Nations mission\r\nshould assess war damage resulting from the acts of armed\r\naggression committed by the Bosnian Serbs. The\r\naggressors must know that they will have to pay war\r\nreparations to those who are their victims. This will remind\r\naggressors always to think twice before firing and\r\ndestroying.\r\nOn the basis of its common historical ties with the\r\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir, especially common\r\nreligious ties with its Muslim population, the Islamic State\r\nof Afghanistan is deeply concerned at the exacerbation of\r\nthe situation in that territory. The sufferings of the Muslim\r\npeople of Kashmir add to our grief. We continue to\r\nbelieve that the question of Kashmir, which has always\r\nbeen one of the prime concerns of the Muslim Umma,\r\ncan find a lasting solution through peaceful means in an\r\natmosphere of trust, understanding and good-\r\nneighbourliness between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan\r\nand the Republic of India, a solution on the basis of the\r\nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations and\r\ninternationally accepted principles on the settlement of\r\ndisputes.\r\nDuring these crucial moments of the history of the\r\nPalestinian people, we reiterate the responsibility of the\r\ninternational community to support the inalienable\r\nnational rights of the Palestinians, including their right to\r\nreturn to their homeland, and the right to\r\nself-determination, encompassing the right to their own\r\nindependent State on their national soil, with Al-Quds\r\nal-Sharif as its capital. The peace process has to be\r\naimed at the full implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) guaranteeing the\r\nfull withdrawal of occupying forces from all the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories.\r\nThe Afghan nation, like other Islamic nations,\r\nconsiders the occupation of the site of one of the most\r\nsacred shrines of Islam, in Al-Quds, by authorities lacking\r\nawareness of its sacred Islamic character, as contempt for\r\nthe most basic spiritual rights of the Islamic community\r\nall over the world.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to draw the attention of this\r\nworld gathering to the fact that, as a result of heavy\r\nrocket attacks on Kabul by the opposition, as well as their\r\nblocking of the roads to Kabul, the capital has been\r\nwithout running water, electricity or heating for most of\r\nthe time since last January. Also, a shortage of food\r\nsupplies seems to be threatening the city’s most\r\nvulnerable inhabitants who are suffering. It has been\r\npredicted that the coming winter will be a harsh one.\r\nAs the International Committee of the Red Cross\r\n(ICRC) fears, a large-scale human disaster may be\r\nimpossible to avert. We request the donor community to\r\nrespond positively and urgently to the United Nations\r\nappeal for winter emergency assistance to the city of\r\nKabul.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation\r\nof Benin, His Excellency Mr. Robert Dossou.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nMr. Dossou (Benin) (interpretation from French): I\r\nshould like first of all, Mr. President, to tell you how\r\npleased the Benin delegation is to see you presiding over\r\nthis session of the General Assembly. This is an honour\r\nfor all of Africa, and especially your country, with which\r\nBenin has age-old ties of friendship and, still more, of\r\nfraternity.\r\nAt a time when, more than ever before, the United\r\nNations is called upon to act in the interests of peace and\r\nthe well-being of mankind, this election is\r\nacknowledgement by the international community not only\r\nof the dedication of Côte d’Ivoire to the cause of peace and\r\nprosperity but also of your personal qualities as a seasoned\r\ndiplomat.\r\nBenin is proud to see a distinguished representative of\r\na country from the subregion of West Africa assume this\r\nimportant responsibility, and can assure you, Sir, of the\r\ncooperation and support of its delegation - and here we\r\nwish also to congratulate the other members of the General\r\nCommittee.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not align myself, with great\r\nemotion and pleasure, with what His Excellency Mr. Konan\r\nBédié, President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire said, that\r\nin your election we can already see that Africa is resisting\r\nmarginalization.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to your eminent\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of\r\nGuyana, who assumed with such great competence and skill\r\nthe presidency of our Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nHe has left an indelible mark on this world Organization\r\nthrough his personal contribution to our efforts at\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly, restructuring the\r\nSecurity Council and resuming development.\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of Benin,\r\nI should like to pay a most deserved tribute to the United\r\nNations and its Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, for the intensive activities they have been carrying\r\nout for peace and development for all peoples, especially at\r\nthis time when armed conflict, ethnic clashes and tribal\r\nwarfare distort the basic values of mankind.\r\nI should also like to welcome the granting to the\r\nSovereign Military Order of Malta of Observer status at the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nSince our last session, positive developments have\r\ntaken place in the settlement of internal, local and regional\r\nconflicts that have caused upheavals in the international\r\narena. I would mention, among others, the emergence of\r\na new South Africa, one that is united, democratic and\r\nnon-racial, where each person can at last enjoy full\r\ncitizenship.\r\nBenin hails once again the courage and\r\ndetermination of the South African people - courage and\r\ndetermination that have enabled all humanity to win this\r\nhistoric victory, one of dialogue over confrontation and of\r\npeace over violence.\r\nOur Organization, which is proud of its contribution,\r\nmust see to it the consolidation of the policy of unity and\r\nnational reconciliation and reconstruction pursued by\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela, whose wisdom and clear-\r\nsightedness are equalled only by the historic dimensions\r\nof the man himself.\r\nIn Mozambique, our most cherished wish is for a\r\ncontinuation of the process of reconciliation currently\r\nunder way until the final holding in October of free and\r\ndemocratic elections in that country, stricken by so many\r\nyears of civil war.\r\nSimilarly, we express the hope that in Angola the\r\nnegotiations under way between the Angolan Government\r\nand UNITA might lead to an effective cease-fire and to\r\nthe establishment of a lasting peace, which are absolute\r\nprerequisites for reconciliation and national reconstruction.\r\nWith regard to the question of Palestine, we\r\nwelcome the positive and irreversible developments\r\ntowards a just and lasting settlement since the historic\r\nsigning, between the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\nand Israel, of the Declaration of Principles on Palestinian\r\nautonomy in Gaza and Jericho. In the same context, the\r\nBenin delegation would encourage Israel and the Arab\r\nStates to continue to improve their relations through\r\ncooperation and mutual understanding for the\r\nestablishment of lasting peace in the Middle East.\r\nAs regards the situation between Kuwait and Iraq, it\r\nis important, in the interest of security and stability in the\r\nGulf, that Iraq confirm clearly, and without ambiguity, its\r\nrecognition of the sovereignty, independence, territorial\r\nintegrity and the international borders of Kuwait by\r\nagreeing, among other things, to Security Council\r\nresolution 833 (1993).\r\nOther conflicts are now in the process of being\r\nsettled elsewhere, for example in Cambodia and Central\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nAmerica, where praiseworthy efforts are under way with a\r\nview to the gradual and definitive normalization of the\r\npolitical situation.\r\nIn spite of these encouraging facts, we regret to note\r\nthat the persistent activities of forces for fragmentation and\r\ndisintegration are hindering the achievement of peace in\r\ncertain parts of the world.\r\nIn this context, we should point out, inter alia, the\r\nvery alarming situation in Somalia, where military\r\nintransigence and political intolerance are to no avail\r\nprolonging human suffering, jeopardizing the lives of the\r\nstaff of United Nations peace-keeping and peacemaking\r\noperations, and provoking some irritation within the\r\ninternational community, whose valuable contribution to a\r\npeaceful and lasting settlement is absolutely necessary. It\r\nis time for the protagonists, on whom an acceptable\r\nsolution to their conflicts depends, to show good will and\r\nflexibility.\r\nWe deplore the fact that in Liberia, in spite of the\r\nconsiderable efforts made by the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS), supported by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and by the United\r\nNations, the implementation of the Cotonou agreement has\r\nbeen carried out only begrudgingly. Six months after\r\ntaking office on 7 March 1994, the National Transitional\r\nGovernment has not yet managed effectively to extend its\r\nauthority to the entire country, whereas the disarmament\r\nand demobilization process is practically suspended.\r\nSince a return to normalcy in Liberia is absolutely\r\nnecessary for the continuation of the programme of\r\neconomic integration of the subregion of West Africa, my\r\ncountry urges the Liberian parties to abide by the Cotonou\r\nagreement so as to speed the return of the country to\r\nnormalcy. Once again Benin encourages the international\r\ncommunity to maintain and increase financial assistance so\r\nas to enable the ECOWAS Military Observer Group,\r\nexpanded by troops from Uganda and Tanzania, to fully\r\ndischarge its mandate.\r\nWith regard to Rwanda, ravaged by a war reminiscent\r\nof another age, Benin joins in the indignation expressed by\r\nthe international community by condemning most\r\nvigorously the massive and systematic violations of human\r\nrights and of international humanitarian law. We welcome\r\nthe humanitarian activities and good offices of the United\r\nNations, of the OAU, of France, of the United States of\r\nAmerica, of the African countries, and particularly those of\r\nthe subregion, as well as those of non-governmental\r\norganizations in coming to the assistance of refugees and\r\nhelping to initiate a dialogue among Rwandans. The\r\ndelegation of Benin is convinced that any lasting national\r\nreconciliation in Rwanda must be based on the Arusha\r\nagreement of 4 August 1993 in order to maximize the\r\nopportunities to rebuild the country.\r\nBut in order to avoid a repetition of the Rwandan\r\nholocaust elsewhere, we should support efforts to identify\r\nthose guilty of abuses, whoever they may be, so that they\r\nmight answer for their crimes against humanity.\r\nIn neighbouring Burundi, most recently torn by\r\narmed clashes, the return to a precarious calm and the\r\nagreement for a government that was recently signed by\r\nthe parties to the conflict bear witness to a new awareness\r\non the part of that fraternal people, the fate of whom had\r\nbeen of great concern to all peace- and freedom-loving\r\nmen and women throughout the world. We urge them\r\nmost earnestly to continue along this path so as to\r\nconsolidate their unity and cohesion.\r\nFurthermore, the international community has\r\nfollowed very closely recent developments in the situation\r\nin Haiti. In fact, on the basis of Security Council 940\r\n(1994), the United States Government showed firmness\r\nand intelligence by forcing the Port-au-Prince dictators to\r\nagree to give up the power they seized three years ago.\r\nBenin exhorts the United Nations, the Organization\r\nof American States and the United States of America to\r\nunite their efforts to bring about the effective\r\nreinstatement of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the\r\npeaceful restoration of democracy in Haiti. The Republic\r\nof Benin is prepared, within its modest resources, to make\r\nits contribution to the triumph of peace and democracy in\r\nHaiti.\r\nIn Europe - specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina -\r\nit is to be regretted that the Serbs have rejected the latest\r\npeace plan of the Contact Group, which offered them\r\n49 per cent of the Bosnian territory. We will welcome\r\nthe agreement by the Belgrade authorities to deploy\r\nUnited Nations forces along their country’s borders and\r\nto enforce the international arms embargo.\r\nFaced with the intransigence of the Bosnian Serbs,\r\nthe international community should take over the\r\nprotection and defence of the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of Bosnia, so as to avoid any spread of this\r\ninterminable conflict, which has already been exacerbated\r\nby the hateful practice of \"ethnic cleansing\".\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nFollowing the collapse of ideologies, the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in world affairs is and remains essential.\r\nWe should avoid any weakening of its ability effectively\r\nand efficiently to promote peace, as this would do great\r\nharm to its credibility. The revitalization, restructuring and\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations must continue in\r\norder to increase its efficiency in carrying out the work it\r\nhas undertaken.\r\nThis, for example, should be the case for the Security\r\nCouncil, which has the responsibility of acting on behalf of\r\nMember States for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. Its legitimacy, its credibility and its\r\neffectiveness will be strengthened if we are able to take\r\nsteps to enlarge it and change the composition of its\r\nmembership so as to reflect the increase in the number of\r\nStates Members of this world Organization.\r\nAware of the fact that, in this new context, the\r\nSecurity Council cannot remain as it was designed and\r\ncreated a half-century ago, the delegation of Benin is in\r\nfavour of a patient search for consensus on all issues\r\npertaining to its reform.\r\nThe production, international transfer and\r\naccumulation of arms are a threat to peace and stability the\r\nworld over. This is why the international community’s\r\ncommitment to peace requires the firm determination to\r\nmake real progress in the process of general and complete\r\ndisarmament under international control.\r\nIn the area of conflict prevention and crisis\r\nmanagement, we must strengthen the capabilities of the\r\nUnited Nations and support the idea of good offices and of\r\npreventive diplomacy as advocated by the Secretary-General\r\nin the Agenda for Peace.\r\nRespect for the principle of the sovereignty of States\r\ncould hinder the implementation of this approach. Indeed,\r\ncrises or conflicts today are for the most part internal in\r\nnature - civil wars, territorial partitions, ethnic clashes,\r\nreligious or tribal struggles, and so forth. But these crises\r\nand conflicts can also threaten international peace and\r\nsecurity. Hence there is a balance to be struck between\r\nintervention and respect for the sovereignty of States.\r\nIn this context, we shall continue to encourage close\r\ncooperation with regional organizations, pursuant to Chapter\r\nVIII of the United Nations Charter. Within Africa, there is\r\nalready in place a mechanism for preventing, managing and\r\nsettling conflicts which makes the development and\r\nstrengthening of such cooperation possible.\r\nI would also mention, as part of regional\r\ncontributions to global efforts for peace, the conclusions\r\nreached by the Third Ministerial Meeting of the Zone of\r\nPeace and Cooperation in the South Atlantic, held in\r\nBrasilia on 21 and 22 September 1994.\r\nWe can never emphasize enough the close\r\nrelationship between peace, democracy, human rights and\r\nsustainable development. And we should be pleased that\r\nour Organization offers a proper framework for the\r\nachievement of consensus on this relationship. The\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action of the important\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in\r\n1993 prove that the international community is\r\ndetermined to face up to these non-military threats to\r\npeace and security the world over.\r\nEconomic and social issues are of concern today to\r\nthe entire world and raise moral issues among politicians,\r\nGovernments and representatives of civilian society. The\r\nend of the cold war, far from ironing out difficulties, has\r\nfurther widened the gap between the developed and the\r\ndeveloping countries. The developed and the developing\r\ncountries must work together and understand one another\r\nif there is to be progress and, especially, peace for all.\r\nThere are many social and economic problems\r\nfacing the world, and we must attack these ills at their\r\nvery roots. The preparations for the commemoration of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the United\r\nNations, and the major conferences it has organized since\r\n1994, provide us with an opportunity to better deal with\r\nthe major problems that are undermining and marring\r\ntoday’s world.\r\nAbove and beyond general political declarations,\r\npromises unkept and wishes unfulfilled, all the actors in\r\nthe international community must by common agreement\r\ndraw up concrete, effective and immediate solutions that\r\nwill allow us to avoid chaos in the developing countries,\r\nin particular in Africa and in the least developed\r\ncountries. Otherwise, our expectations for the beginning\r\nof the twenty-first century will not be met.\r\nNone the less, there is room for hope when we\r\nremember that the Assembly, in resolution 47/181 of 22\r\nDecember 1992, asked the Secretary-General to submit to\r\nit a report on an agenda for development, after consulting\r\nwith Member States. The drafting of this agenda, to be\r\nadopted during the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, will be a clear\r\ndeclaration of the right to development and a reorientation\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nof the objectives and priorities of the United Nations system\r\ntowards socio-economic activities and programmes designed\r\nfirst and foremost to eliminate poverty and then to develop\r\nhuman resources through education, training, the creation of\r\nproductive employment, and social integration.\r\nIt is thus possible to change the current situation and\r\nto reverse the process of impoverishment, aggravated by\r\neconomic stagnation. The agenda for development will\r\nusefully complement Agenda 21 and the Agenda for Peace\r\nin the quest for sustainable development.\r\nOur vision of the twenty-first century and our\r\nprospects for the future should be illuminated and\r\nstrengthened by the effective implementation of the various\r\nprogrammes and plans of action adopted since the\r\nbeginning of this decade within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations system. I would like to cite, as examples,\r\nthe Plan of Action for children, the Programme of Action\r\nfor the least developed countries in the 1990s, and the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s (UN-NADAF). While the implementation of\r\nthe first two programmes has already begun and we will\r\nalready be able to take stock of them a mid-term review in\r\n1995, UN-NADAF is still in its infancy. Indeed, there has\r\nbeen no concrete action, no funding for projects and no\r\ncommitment of financial resources since the adoption of the\r\nnew programme in December 1991 by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nFurthermore, the planned resumed session to continue\r\nand complete negotiations on the draft resolution to create\r\na diversification fund for African commodities has\r\nremained wishful thinking - for want, we are told, of a\r\npresident to lead the debates and to conclude the work -\r\nand all this, in spite of the efforts made by the President of\r\nlast year’s General Assembly session.\r\nNone the less, we welcome the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations of the second part of the thirty-fourth\r\nsession of the Committee for Programme and Coordination\r\non a revised, system-wide plan of action for economic\r\nrecovery and development in Africa.\r\nBut we need not limit ourselves to establishing a\r\ncloser relationship between a system-wide plan and UN-\r\nNADAF or to determining the priority sectors to be the\r\nfocal points of action carried out thanks to the cooperation\r\nof United Nations bodies for the remaining period of the\r\nplan’s implementation. In addition to the present resources,\r\nwe must mobilize supplementary resources for the effective\r\nimplementation of the activities and programmes involved.\r\nThe economic and social crises that today are\r\ncausing upheaval in Africa have highlighted the\r\nchallenges to be taken up by that continent in order to\r\nmake progress along the path of development. To cope\r\nwith these crises, most of our countries have undertaken\r\nfar-reaching political and economic reforms.\r\nIn Benin, we are continuing our march forward to\r\nmake sure that our democratic process - begun almost\r\nfive years ago - takes root and that our national economy\r\nis consolidated. In spite of substantial efforts and\r\nsacrifices, our political and economic structures remain\r\nfragile and vulnerable.\r\nFurthermore, taking up the challenges of the 1990s\r\nin Africa necessarily means finding rapid and lasting\r\nsolutions to problems linked to foreign indebtedness,\r\nseeking an inflow of new financial and other resources to\r\nmeet the growing development needs, ensuring the\r\ntransfer of new and appropriate technology; and\r\npromoting a truly open and equitable system of\r\ninternational trade, as well as encouraging the\r\ndiversification and modernization of African economies.\r\nAs regards external debt, the developed countries\r\nwill have to exert clear and resolute political\r\ndetermination by pursuing a policy of cancelling outright\r\nthe official debt of the African and least developed\r\ncountries; by deciding, in the managing boards of the\r\nmultilateral financial institutions, to reduce by 50 per cent\r\nthe multilateral debt of the developing countries,\r\nparticularly of the African and least developed countries;\r\nand by negotiating with the banking institutions a\r\nrescheduling of commercial debt. We remain convinced\r\nthat these initiatives are within the scope of the\r\nGovernments of the developed countries and can be\r\nimplemented in a demonstration that the world is\r\nchanging.\r\nWith regard to international trade, the mixed results\r\nfor Africa of the negotiations of the Uruguay Round give\r\nus little hope that, within the framework of international\r\ntrade, our countries will soon emerge from the\r\nmarginalization in which they have existed since the late\r\n1980s. As in all previous rounds of the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Uruguay Round led\r\nto the elimination of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers.\r\nBut the common estimates of the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\nshow that the overall result of this eighth round of\r\nnegotiations will only benefit the industrial countries. For\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nAfrica, for example, the OECD studies predict losses of\r\nover $2 billion by the year 2002, not to mention the fact\r\nthat the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific\r\nthat are linked to the European Union by the Lomé\r\nConvention risk losing certain advantages they have\r\nenjoyed until now.\r\nFurthermore, the results of the negotiations of the\r\nUruguay Round are making the developing countries,\r\nparticularly those of Africa, dependent on food products\r\nimported from developed countries, whereas the objective\r\nof the current strategies is to ensure food security in Africa.\r\nIn such circumstances, Benin earnestly hopes that the first\r\naction taken by the World Trade Organization will be to\r\nclose the loopholes of the negotiated text by making bold\r\ndecisions and recommendations on behalf of Africa and\r\nthereby correcting drawbacks foreseen from the outset.\r\nThe decisions and recommendations of the Earth\r\nSummit will, as they are implemented, gradually become\r\nsolid landmarks for current and future generations in the\r\nbuilding of a society that, thanks to the achievement of\r\nsustainable development, will not run the risk of self-\r\ndestruction.\r\nIn this framework, Benin welcomes the adoption on 6\r\nMay 1994 in Barbados of the Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates. Benin also welcomes the conclusion in Paris on 17\r\nJune of the International Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa. We\r\nhope that this Convention and the regional Annex for\r\nimplementation in Africa will serve as a basis for a new\r\ncontract between Governments, donors and local\r\npopulations in their efforts to combat desertification and\r\nmitigate the effects of drought. This new contract must be\r\nreflected in firm and precise commitments of financial\r\nresources and the transfer of ecologically sound technology.\r\nIf it is not, we will find ourselves in the same unfortunate\r\nsituation that led, because of a lack of sufficient resources\r\nand the poor management of those allocated, to the\r\nnon-implementation of the results of the United Nations\r\nConference on Desertification held in Nairobi in 1977.\r\nBenin therefore appeals to all States to attend the signing\r\nceremony for the Convention on 14 and 15 October in\r\nParis.\r\nThe curtain has barely dropped on the Cairo\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nwhich marks the birth of a new process for population and\r\ndevelopment strategies. The intensity of debate during the\r\nConference was commensurate with the importance of the\r\nissue. In order to meet the challenge of the development\r\nto which countries throughout the world aspire, we must\r\nset our children and women, who represent the majority\r\nof the populations of our countries, along the road to\r\nprogress, which requires information, education and\r\ntraining.\r\nThe work of the preparatory committees for\r\nimportant United Nations conferences being organized at\r\nthe moment - especially the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, the Fourth World Conference on Women,\r\nthe second United Nations Conference on Human\r\nSettlements (Habitat II) and the entry into force on 16\r\nNovember 1994 of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, completed last July with the agreement\r\non Part XI - will strengthen the positive trend clearly\r\nexpressed during earlier negotiations. Nevertheless, the\r\nlife-giving flame fed by the spirit of Rio de Janeiro might\r\ngo out if intellectual efforts are not complemented by a\r\nmobilization of new and addition financial resources to\r\ncarry out all the activities planned.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development will\r\nbring together for the first time Heads of State or\r\nGovernment in order to take decisions on social\r\ndevelopment. Benin believes that the declaration and\r\nprogramme of action to be adopted in Copenhagen in\r\nMarch 1995 should not be limited to acknowledging and\r\naccepting the fact that Africa is the continent facing the\r\ngreatest number of social problems. These two\r\ndocuments should be a reference point that clearly defines\r\nconcrete measures, an implementation schedule and the\r\nestimated costs of activities aimed at eliminating poverty\r\nand creating productive employment and social\r\nintegration.\r\nBenin suggests that the Copenhagen Summit\r\nrecommend the proclamation of an international decade\r\nfor the eradication of poverty, which would be the\r\ncontinuation of the International Year for the Eradication\r\nof Poverty adopted under General Assembly resolution\r\n48/183.\r\nThe new international situation calls for\r\nstrengthening, democratizing and rationalizing the\r\nactivities of the United Nations, and it is up to us the\r\nMember States to make an outstanding contribution in the\r\npursuit of the noble objectives of peace, justice and\r\ndevelopment. We feel that this is possible if all Member\r\nStates respect the obligations incumbent upon them under\r\nthe Charter.\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 30 September 1994\r\nThe delegation of Benin is convinced that our current\r\ndeliberations will be guided by a common determination to\r\ntake concerted and concrete steps best suited to the\r\nnecessity of maintaining peace and promoting prosperity\r\nthroughout the world. In particular, this will require a\r\nrejection of indecisiveness and self-absorption.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): We have\r\nheard the last speaker in the general debate for this\r\nmeeting.\r\nI now call on the representative of Greece, who wishes\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second intervention\r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Stathatos (Greece): I should like to respond\r\nbriefly - very briefly indeed - to the statement made\r\nyesterday by the Croatian delegation.\r\nFirst of all, the Greek delegation wishes to express\r\nits satisfaction at the recognition by the representative of\r\nthe Republic of Croatia of the constructive actions of the\r\nGreek Government that could help to resolve the crisis in\r\nthe region in a just and equitable manner.\r\nAs to the reference by the Greek Foreign Minister to\r\nthe \"problem of the Krajinas\", it is obvious that this had\r\na mere geographical connotation, and could by no means\r\nbe construed or interpreted as a reference to the various\r\nsubstantial aspects of the problem nor as putting into\r\nquestion the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia.\r\nGreece’s position in this respect is in full harmony\r\nwith that of the European Union as it appears in the\r\nmemorandum attached to the text of the speech delivered\r\nby the President of the Council of the European Union on\r\n27 September 1994. Coincidentally, he also used the\r\nterm \"Krajina\", without, however, provoking any similar\r\nreaction from the Croatian delegation.\r\nMay I add that, since the Republic of Croatia seems\r\nto be particularly sensitive to geographic and State names,\r\nas well as to the principle of consistency, it is only\r\nnatural and legitimate to expect it to show the same\r\nsensitivity and consistency regarding the names of other\r\nStates in the region, by abstaining from the practice it has\r\nfollowed thus far and by complying with the relevant and\r\nunambiguous provisions of Security Council resolution\r\n817 (1993). Anyway, a reference made in this respect\r\nthis afternoon in the Security Council by the\r\nrepresentative of Croatia is considered by the Greek\r\ndelegation as a step in the right direction.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.40 p.m.\r\n36\r\n"
