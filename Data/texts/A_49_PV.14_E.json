Côte d’Ivoire\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.40 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus, His Excellency Mr. Glafcos Clerides,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Clerides: I should like to extend to you,\r\nSir, my warmest felicitations on your well-deserved election\r\nto the high office of the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly. This is not only a mere recognition of your\r\nlong experience and your outstanding ability and diplomatic\r\nskill but also a reflection of the esteem in which your\r\ncountry, Côte d’Ivoire, is held in the United Nations.\r\nI should also like to express our great appreciation and\r\nadmiration for the work of the Secretary-General and for\r\nthe determined and prudent leadership which he has\r\ndemonstrated on vital international issues.\r\nDespite important positive developments on a great\r\nnumber of issues occupying the attention and energy of\r\nour Organization, a significant number of old problems\r\nremain unresolved. Ethnic conflicts, nationalistic\r\nchauvinism, ethnic cleansing, xenophobia, racial\r\ndiscrimination, expansionist opportunism, social and\r\neconomic disparities, underdevelopment, the waste of\r\nscarce resources on fraternal enmities, the lack of\r\nnecessary commitment for the protection of the\r\nenvironment and gross and massive violations of human\r\nrights are only some of the evils still afflicting humanity\r\ntoday.\r\nAmong our priorities therefore should be the\r\nunequivocal reversal of the results of aggression and\r\nforeign occupation, support and defence of democracy,\r\nthe inversion of social and economic inequalities, the\r\nprotection of our environment and, finally, the protection\r\nand enhancement of human rights for all.\r\nIn order to accomplish such goals on a universal\r\nscale our Organization has to adapt, expeditiously and\r\neffectively, to the changing conditions and to the new\r\nchallenges. Better coordination between the various\r\nbodies that form the United Nations system is urgently\r\nrequired. The Secretary-General’s recent decision to\r\nboost the coordinating role of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme on all developmental issues is\r\na commendable step in the right direction.\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nWe are constantly witnessing world calamities.\r\nRwanda and the former Yugoslavia are dire and gory\r\nexamples. Our common goal should be to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations in order best to respond to today’s\r\nchallenges and the increased expectations of mankind for\r\nsecurity, economic viability and democracy. These\r\nexpectations can only be met by making the United Nations\r\nmore effective through the implementation of its own\r\nresolutions and the mandatory provisions of the Charter.\r\nThe General Assembly, the most prominent global\r\ndemocratic forum, represents the full membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. It functions on the principle of sovereign\r\nequality. As such, it has played a major role towards the\r\nrealization of the objectives of the world community and\r\nmust continue to do so in accordance with its mandate\r\nunder the Charter.\r\nGiven today’s political realities, however, the Security\r\nCouncil has a substantially enlarged agenda and a more\r\ndynamic role to perform. In accordance with the Charter,\r\nthat organ has the ability to decide and to act. Nowadays\r\nit is able to act more effectively in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. In today’s post-cold-war\r\nera the Security Council is in a position to play a broader\r\nand much more important role than ever before. In a world\r\nwhere new challenges require urgent solutions, such a\r\ndevelopment is welcome. Within the context of the\r\nreinforced and expanded role, a successful outcome of the\r\ndeliberations on the review of the Council’s membership to\r\nreflect the realities of today’s world is highly appreciated.\r\nHowever, the effectiveness of the most powerful organ\r\nof the United Nations is seriously compromised if it applies\r\ndouble standards. It must act in every case with\r\ndetermination and consistency. The record of its\r\nperformance indicates clearly that in those cases where the\r\ninternational community has shown steadfastness to defend\r\nthe principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and\r\nfully to implement its provisions, peace and justice was\r\nachieved. On the contrary, in those cases where unity of\r\npurpose had not been exhibited or the interests of nations\r\nor alliances had been placed above the universal principles\r\nand the rule of law, the problems remain and peace is\r\nelusive.\r\nThe financial difficulties confronting the Organization\r\npose severe constraints on its ever-increasing role in today’s\r\nworld affairs. Every effort should be made to provide the\r\nOrganization with the necessary means to perform its vital\r\nmission effectively. In this regard I would recall that my\r\nGovernment decided early this year, after an appeal by the\r\nSecretary-General, to double on a voluntary basis its\r\nassessed contribution to all peace-keeping operations.\r\nOur commitment to the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes was thus manifested once again in a concrete and\r\npractical way. We hope that our gesture will soon be\r\nemulated by others. Our Organization desperately needs\r\ngenerosity by its Member States if it is to continue\r\nperforming its herculean mission effectively.\r\nIt is widely acknowledged that economics plays an\r\nimportant role in today’s world politics. Development,\r\nthe protection of the environment, poverty alleviation,\r\nsocial progress, the improvement of health standards,\r\nproper education and sound technology require financial\r\nmeans for their attainment. In this exercise the United\r\nNations, through the Secretariat itself, the recently\r\nenhanced United Nations Development Programme and\r\nthe various specialized agencies, performs one of the most\r\nimportant missions, that of pursuing the betterment and\r\nthe economic well-being of peoples throughout the world.\r\nThese activities are also amply outlined in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, and therefore I do not intend to dwell on\r\nthem other than to declare that we are cognizant of their\r\nimportance and that they have our full support. We\r\ncommend the Secretary-General’s integrated approach to\r\ndevelopment issues in \"An Agenda for Development\",\r\nwhich complements his ground-breaking \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\". We fully subscribe to the Secretary-General’s\r\nassertion that development is a fundamental human right\r\nand that development is the most secure basis for peace.\r\nIn accordance with the deliberations on the subject,\r\na successful implementation of the agenda for\r\ndevelopment depends on the priority to be given the\r\nfollowing elements: the alleviation of poverty and its\r\nunderlying causes, especially in Africa and other least-\r\ndeveloped regions; health and the status of women.\r\nThere is an urgent need for clear and effective population\r\npolicies.\r\nIn this regard, the recently concluded Cairo\r\nConference on Population and Development rightly placed\r\ngreat emphasis on development and the environment.\r\nThe new characteristic of the Conference’s Programme of\r\nAction is precisely this linkage with sustainable\r\ndevelopment and protection of the environment. It\r\nconstitutes progress by integrating control of population,\r\nenvironmental protection and economic growth into the\r\napproach to population issues.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nThe Rio Conference was a historic turning point in\r\nthis direction. Yet the follow-up and implementation of the\r\ndecisions taken at the Earth Summit remain contingent on\r\nthe political will to save our living space’s web of life.\r\nThe Barbados Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, as the first\r\ntest of the international community’s attachment to the Rio\r\ncommitments, focused on the acute problems that small\r\nisland developing States are confronted with. Cyprus, an\r\nactive member of this group, reiterates its commitment to\r\nthe early and prompt implementation of the Barbados\r\ncommitments, and expresses the hope that every member of\r\nthe international community will conscientiously fulfil its\r\nrelevant obligations.\r\nWe also welcome the recent broader agreement on\r\nseabed issues of the Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\npromoting universal application of the new legal order\r\ngoverning the seas and thus opening a new chapter in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nIn the light of our philosophy and experience, we\r\nattach much importance to the effective functioning of the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations - the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. The increase in its\r\njurisdiction in contentious cases is encouraging. We also\r\nattach great significance to the possibility of clarifying legal\r\npoints in political disputes through advisory opinions. The\r\nInternational Court of Justice is indeed an integral part of\r\nthe United Nations peacemaking efforts and we\r\nwholeheartedly support the Secretary-General’s proposal\r\nthat he be authorized to seek advisory opinions from the\r\nCourt as an important component of the peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe Secretariat’s role in an improved, rationalized and\r\nmore effective United Nations is irrefutable. We have\r\nnothing but praise for the many men and women in the\r\ninternational civil service whose competence and dedication\r\nunder harsh circumstances enable the Organization to\r\nrespond to the ever-increasing demands in today’s global\r\nenvironment. The Secretary-General has already done\r\nmuch in the direction of rationalizing and streamlining the\r\nSecretariat. He certainly has our support in the additional\r\nmeasures needed to carry out this task. We join in\r\nrecognizing the imperative need for adequate financial\r\nresources for the Organization, and for assessed\r\ncontributions to be paid in full and promptly by Member\r\nStates.\r\nIt should be recognized that true respect for human\r\nrights provides the foundation for the structure and\r\norganization of any society. Past and recent experience\r\nin every region of the world has demonstrated that the\r\nprotection and promotion of human rights is an\r\nindispensable ingredient of a stable, just and democratic\r\nworld order. Over the years, the United Nations has\r\nplayed a leading role in affirming human equality, which\r\nin essence forms the core of all rights, and in eliminating\r\nseparations based on ethnicity, religion, culture, socio-\r\neconomic disparities and political philosophies.\r\nIf we recognize the value of the axiom that in States\r\ngoverned by the rule of law the rights of citizens must be\r\nprotected unconditionally, then we should also accept the\r\nanalogy: that the same rights should be safeguarded for\r\nevery single citizen of a global State governed by the rule\r\nof law.\r\nAll the efforts of today’s global community should\r\ntherefore be exerted towards the implementation of the\r\nbasic idea inherent in the international law of human\r\nrights - namely, that all the social mechanisms should\r\nexist to enhance the dignity of human beings, not to\r\nexploit them. Human rights are a powerful means to this\r\nend.\r\nIn order to achieve full respect for human rights and\r\nto eliminate human suffering, the world community must\r\nclearly oppose extreme nationalism, take unequivocal\r\nstands against policies of \"ethnic cleansing\" and continue\r\nexerting steadfast efforts until we achieve the concrete\r\ndismantling of unjust and inhumane social systems that\r\nare based on ethnic segregation.\r\nThe effective promotion of human rights is naturally\r\nentwined with the global trend towards democratization.\r\nCyprus is in the vanguard of States that have become\r\nparty to international instruments for the protection of\r\nhuman rights, both at the global level, within the United\r\nNations and at the regional level, primarily through the\r\nCouncil of Europe.\r\nWe have had occasion in the past to express our\r\nsupport for the Secretary-General’s constructive and\r\ntimely suggestions for improving the potential of United\r\nNations peace-keeping. We are encouraged that much\r\nprogress has been made in this field. In view, however,\r\nof the ever-increasing demands and the worsening\r\nfinancial problems associated with peace-keeping, we\r\nshould continue to do our best to assist in discharging, as\r\neffectively as possible, this major responsibility of the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nOrganization. In this regard, may I recall that Cyprus, itself\r\na victim of foreign aggression, invasion and occupation, has\r\nvoluntarily undertaken the onus of paying on a yearly basis\r\none-third of the total cost of the United Nations Peace-\r\nkeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), which for the current\r\n12-month period amounts to $18 million. Similarly, the\r\nGreek Government generously offered a voluntary\r\ncontribution to UNFICYP of $6.5 million for the same\r\nperiod.\r\nSince the Republic of Cyprus has itself been one of\r\nthe longest beneficiaries of peace-keeping operations, I\r\nwould like to avail myself of this opportunity to express the\r\nappreciation of my country and its people to the\r\nOrganization and its peace-keeping function. I also take\r\nthis opportunity to express to the troop-contributing\r\ncountries our gratitude for sustaining UNFICYP for so\r\nmany years until the anomaly in the financing of the Force\r\nwas finally overcome in June 1993. On this occasion, I\r\nshould like to express the hope that a sound and fair\r\nsolution to the question of reimbursement to troop-\r\ncontributing countries will be found during the deliberations\r\nat this session. My country stands ready to offer every\r\npossible assistance towards the attainment of this aim.\r\nI shall refrain from addressing the long list of\r\ninternational problems described in this year’s report by the\r\nSecretary-General (A/49/1) with which the Organization is\r\nactively dealing and which extend to all five continents.\r\nEach issue presents its own complications and special\r\ncharacteristics. Together, all the issues provide a measure\r\nof the enormity of what is expected of the United Nations,\r\nthe awesome burden of responsibilities of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the respect and admiration he deserves in\r\ncarrying out these tasks. As he has rightly pointed out in\r\nthe past:\r\n\"The United Nations, by undertaking a range of\r\nproblems as wide as the globe itself, must be expected\r\nto achieve successes but also to experience failures.\"\r\n(A/48/1, para. 512)\r\nOur world has witnessed in the last few years the\r\ncreation of new areas of tension and conflict through the\r\nunleashing of the destructive and centrifugal forces of\r\nchauvinism and ethnic strife. There have also been at the\r\nsame time some notable successes through the resolution of\r\nseveral regional issues and the withdrawal of foreign forces\r\nfollowing the end of our bipolar antagonistic world. We\r\nhave witnessed in many parts of the world the triumph of\r\nreason, the entrenchment of democracy and the emergence\r\nof free market economies. The achievement of putting an\r\nend to the odious practice of apartheid in South Africa\r\nbroadens the vistas of human wisdom; the historic\r\nAgreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO) on the one hand, and between Israel\r\nand other neighbouring Arab countries on the other mark\r\na new era in the Middle East. We express the hope that\r\nthe rest of the countries involved in this conflict will very\r\nsoon be able to join the others, thereby signifying one of\r\nthe major turning points in the history of the region.\r\nCyprus, an immediate neighbour, expresses the hope that\r\nsuch a catalytic positive evolution in our region will not\r\nleave our own problem unaffected.\r\nCyprus, almost a decade after the Cold War began\r\nto subside, remains divided as a result of foreign\r\naggression and military occupation, and its people forcibly\r\nseparated. As a result of ethnic cleansing by the\r\naggressor, Cypriots are victims of gross violations of\r\nhuman rights. A large component of the Cyprus question\r\nin its present dimensions is the massive violation of the\r\nhuman rights of the displaced persons who have been\r\nevicted by force from their homes by the Turkish forces\r\nof occupation and whose properties have been usurped by\r\nillegal settlers imported from Turkey to Cyprus in a\r\nsystematic and well-planned policy made by the aggressor\r\nto change the demographic composition of the occupied\r\nparts of Cyprus. In the same vein, the humanitarian issue\r\nof the enclave is another staggering dimension of the\r\nCyprus question. The missing persons still remain\r\nunaccounted for 20 years after the Turkish invasion and\r\noccupation of one third of the territory of the Republic of\r\nCyprus. This constitutes a severe violation of the human\r\nrights both of the missing persons themselves and of the\r\ntragic figures of their relatives.\r\nI put it before the Assembly today that Cyprus is a\r\ntest case for the resolve of the international community\r\nand of this Organization to demand and to enforce respect\r\nfor its will as expressed in a plethora of resolutions.\r\nTwenty years after the Turkish invasion of 1974, the\r\nproblem remains unresolved. The number of Turkish\r\nforces, despite resolutions of this Assembly calling for the\r\nwithdrawal of foreign forces from Cyprus, has in fact\r\nincreased, as is stated in the Secretary-General’s report of\r\n30 May 1994. The presence of Turkish occupation troops\r\nconstitutes a serious threat to the people of Cyprus, and\r\nhas naturally given rise to a kind of arms race.\r\nThe General Assembly and the Security Council\r\nhave repeatedly reaffirmed the legal framework within\r\nwhich a just and lasting solution should be sought. In its\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nmost recent resolution, resolution 939 (1994) of 29 July\r\n1994, this basis is reaffirmed to be\r\n\"... a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty\r\nand independence and international personality and a\r\nsingle citizenship, with its independence and territorial\r\nintegrity safeguarded, and comprising two politically\r\nequal communities as described in the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, in a bi-communal and bi-\r\nzonal federation, and that such a settlement must\r\nexclude union in whole or in part with any other\r\ncountry or any form of partition or secession\"\r\n(para. 2).\r\nThe Greek Cypriot side has for years accepted that a\r\nbi-zonal bi-communal federation was the basis for the\r\nsettlement of the Cyprus problem. The Turkish Cypriot\r\nleadership, fully supported by Turkey, has now made it\r\nclear that they have abandoned federation as the basis of\r\nthe solution and are promoting a loose confederation with\r\nseparate sovereignty for its two component parts.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly and clearly attributed the\r\nfailure to make progress as follows:\r\n\"For the present, the Security Council finds itself\r\nfaced with an already familiar scenario: the absence of\r\nagreement due essentially to a lack of political will on\r\nthe Turkish Cypriot side.\" (S/1994/629, para. 53)\r\nIn the same report to the Security Council, the\r\nSecretary-General states the following:\r\n\"... a good offices mission, which by its nature is\r\ndependent on the consent and cooperation of the\r\nparties, is not an adequate method to deal with a\r\nsituation in which, for the past several years, one side\r\nhas consistently flouted the wishes of the international\r\ncommunity, as represented in the Security Council.\"\r\n(ibid., para. 58)\r\nMy view is that if this flouting and violation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions is allowed to continue, there\r\nwill be no solution of the Cyprus problem. It is therefore\r\nnecessary for coercive action to be taken against the side\r\nthat flouts the United Nations resolutions.\r\nThere is also a further issue that requires to be\r\nurgently addressed. This is the problem of the military\r\nbuild-up which is taking place in Cyprus. The anxieties\r\ncreated by the presence of foreign troops on Cypriot\r\nterritory have given rise to a significant military build-up.\r\nSecurity is an extremely significant area, and is an\r\nissue of substance as well as a way to improve\r\nconfidence. I have therefore proposed the following.\r\nFirstly, the leaders of the two communities during\r\nthe intercommunal talks should make a solemn\r\ndeclaration to the Secretary-General on behalf of their\r\nrespective communities renouncing the use of force\r\nagainst each other and undertaking to take all the\r\nnecessary measures to prevent attack by members of one\r\ncommunity against the other.\r\nSecondly, the Government of the Republic should\r\ntake the following measures: repeal the National Guard\r\nLaw, disband the National Guard and hand over all its\r\narms and military equipment to the custody of the United\r\nNations peace-keeping force; undertake to maintain the\r\npolice force of the Republic at its present numerical\r\nstrength, armed only with light weapons; undertake the\r\ntotal cost of a substantially numerically increased United\r\nNations peace-keeping force; agree that the United\r\nNations peace-keeping force will have the right of\r\ninspection to ascertain compliance with the above; agree\r\nthat the National Guard armoured cars, armoured\r\npersonnel vehicles and tanks, which will be handed over\r\nto the custody of the United Nations peace-keeping force,\r\ncan be used by the United Nations peace-keeping force to\r\npatrol the buffer zone and to prevent intrusions in it; and\r\ndeposit in United Nations accounts all money saved from\r\ndisbanding the National Guard and from stopping the\r\npurchase of arms after deducting the cost of the United\r\nNations peace-keeping force, to be used after the solution\r\nof the problem for the benefit of both communities.\r\nThe Turkish Government, parallel to the above,\r\nshould withdraw the Turkish occupation forces from\r\nCyprus, as well as the illegal settlers, whose presence in\r\nCyprus, apart from violating United Nations resolutions\r\ncalling on both sides to respect the demographic\r\ncomposition of Cyprus, constitutes a military threat.\r\nThe Turkish Cypriots under arms should disband and\r\nhand over their weapons to the peace-keeping force.\r\nThe Turkish side complains that it has been isolated\r\ninternationally. The responsibility for this does not fall\r\non the Republic of Cyprus or on the international\r\ncommunity. It falls squarely on the shoulders of the\r\nTurkish leadership, which, by an act of purported\r\nsecession, declared a separate State. The international\r\ncommunity and the Republic of Cyprus simply respected\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984),\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nwhich deplored the purported secession, asked all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations not to recognize it and\r\ncalled upon the Turkish leadership to recall the act of\r\nsecession. All States respected these resolutions except\r\nTurkey.\r\nA small country has been violated by an aggressor, in\r\ncontravention of the Charter of this Organization, which\r\ndenounces the use of force. Twenty years have passed, and\r\nthe Security Council’s many resolutions remain\r\nunimplemented. Unless the aggressor is faced with\r\nprogressively more severe consequences for its disregard of\r\ninternational legal order, a very bad example and precedent\r\nwill be allowed to cast doubt on the international\r\ncommunity’s resolve and effectiveness.\r\nWith the advent of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, we are bound to review our past\r\nperformance and chart new avenues for the future. Did we\r\nmeet the goals set in 1945 by our founding fathers in the\r\naftermath of two devastating wars? Did we create the\r\nprerequisite for a just and peaceful world? Did we save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war? As we\r\nnear the milestone of the Organization’s fiftieth anniversary,\r\nlet us do some soul-searching, let us not be complacent and\r\nlet us no longer be guilty of errors of omission and\r\ncommission. Above all, let us not remain inactive because\r\nof inertia. People and nations all over the world have ever-\r\ngreater expectations of the Organization and the way in\r\nwhich it responds to the new challenges of our times. The\r\nCharter, by and large, has stood the test of time, but it is\r\nour responsibility to make the United Nations a more\r\neffective Organization. It is the world’s last chance for\r\npeace.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nelson Rorihlahla Mandela, President\r\nof the Republic of South Africa\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Republic of South Africa.\r\nMr. Nelson Rorihlahla Mandela, President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa, His Excellency Mr. Nelson\r\nMandela, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mandela: It surely must be one of the\r\ngreat ironies of our age that this Assembly is being\r\naddressed, for the first time in its 49 years’ history, by a\r\nSouth African Head of State drawn from among the\r\nAfrican majority of what is an African country.\r\nFuture generations will find it strange in the extreme\r\nthat it was only so late in the twentieth century that it was\r\npossible for our delegation to take its seat in the\r\nAssembly, recognized both by our people and by the\r\nnations of the world as the legitimate representative of the\r\npeople of our country.\r\nIt is indeed most welcome that the Organization will\r\nmark its fiftieth anniversary next year with the apartheid\r\nsystem vanquished and consigned to the past. That\r\nhistoric change has come about not least because of the\r\ngreat efforts in which the United Nations engaged to\r\nensure the suppression of the apartheid crime against\r\nhumanity. Even as it was still in the process of\r\nestablishing its institutions, the United Nations was\r\nconfronted by the challenge of the accession to power of\r\nthe party of apartheid domination in our country.\r\nEverything that that system stood for represented the very\r\nopposite of all the noble purposes for which the\r\nOrganization was established. Because apartheid reduced\r\nand undermined the credibility of the United Nations as\r\nan effective international instrument to end racism and\r\nsecure the fundamental human rights of all peoples, the\r\nestablishment and consolidation of apartheid constituted\r\na brazen challenge to the very existence of the\r\nOrganization.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nThe United Nations was born out of the titanic\r\nstruggle against nazism and fascism, with their pernicious\r\ndoctrines and practices of racial superiority and genocide.\r\nIt therefore could not stand by while, in South Africa, a\r\nsimilar system was being established by a Government\r\nwhich also had the temerity to claim representation within\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe believe that it was indeed of great importance to\r\nthe universal efficacy of, and respect for, the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the United Nations\r\nCharter that the United Nations should have spurned the\r\npleas of the apartheid regime that the gross violation of\r\nhuman rights in South Africa was a domestic matter of no\r\nlegal or legitimate concern to the world body.\r\nWe stand here today to salute the United Nations and\r\nits Member States, both singly and collectively, for joining\r\nforces with the masses of our people in a common struggle\r\nthat has brought about our emancipation and pushed back\r\nthe frontiers of racism.\r\nThe millions of our people say \"Thank you\" and\r\n\"Thank you again, because the respect for your own dignity\r\nas human beings inspired you to act to ensure the\r\nrestoration of our dignity as well\".\r\nWe have together traversed a course which we are\r\nconvinced has strengthened human solidarity in general and\r\nreinforced the bonds of friendship between our peoples and\r\nthe nations of the world. This dates back to the early days\r\nwhen India put the question of racism in South Africa on\r\nthe Assembly’s agenda, to the moment when the world\r\ncommunity, as represented here, could adopt consensus\r\nresolutions against apartheid with none dissenting.\r\nIt was therefore with great joy that at our inauguration\r\nas President of our Republic we received, among others,\r\nsuch high and distinguished officials of the Organization as\r\nthe Secretary-General, the President of the General\r\nAssembly and the Chairman of the Special Committee\r\nagainst Apartheid. Their presence reaffirmed the\r\nincontrovertible truth that the victory over apartheid, the\r\nsuccess of the cause of democracy, non-racialism and non-\r\nsexism in our country belongs as much to our people as it\r\ndoes the United Nations.\r\nAnd so we have embarked on the road to the remaking\r\nof our country, basing ourselves both on the democratic\r\nConstitution, which came into force on 27 April this year,\r\nand on the Reconstruction and Development Programme,\r\nwhich has become the property of all our people.\r\nClearly, these documents would have no life unless\r\nthe people gave them life. The words printed in them\r\nmust inspire common ownership by all our people and\r\ntheir common allegiance to the process and the results\r\nwhich these documents intend. For this to happen, as we\r\npropagate the vision these documents contain we must at\r\nthe same time engage in a historic effort of redefinition\r\nof ourselves as a new nation.\r\nOur watchwords must be justice, peace,\r\nreconciliation and nation-building in the pursuit of a\r\ndemocratic, non-racial and non-sexist country. In all that\r\nwe do we have to ensure the healing of the wounds\r\ninflicted on all our people across the great dividing line\r\nimposed on our society by centuries of colonialism and\r\napartheid.\r\nWe must ensure that colour, race and gender become\r\nonly a God-given gift to each one of us, and not an\r\nindelible mark or attribute that accords a special status to\r\nany.\r\nWe must work for the day when we as South\r\nAfricans see one another and interact with one another as\r\nequal human beings and as part of one nation united,\r\nrather than torn asunder, by its diversity.\r\nThe road we shall have to travel to reach this\r\ndestination will by no means be easy. All of us know\r\nhow stubbornly racism can cling to the mind and how\r\ndeeply it can infect the human soul. Where it is sustained\r\nby the racial ordering of the material world, as is the case\r\nin our country, that stubbornness can multiply a\r\nhundredfold.\r\nAnd yet, however hard this battle may be, we will\r\nnot surrender. Whatever the time it may take, we will not\r\ntire. The very fact that racism degrades both the\r\nperpetrator and the victim commands that, if we are true\r\nto our commitment to protect human dignity, we fight on\r\nuntil victory is achieved.\r\nWe firmly believe that we who have particular\r\nexperience of the destructive and anti-human force of\r\nracism owe it to ourselves to centre our transformation on\r\nthe creation of a truly non-racial society. Because we\r\nknow racism so intimately, we must stand a good chance\r\nof developing and nurturing its opposite.\r\nIt will perhaps come to be that we who have\r\nharboured in our country the worst example of racism\r\nsince the defeat of nazism will make a contribution to\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nhuman civilization by ordering our affairs in such a manner\r\nthat we strike an effective and lasting blow against racism\r\neverywhere.\r\nSome of the steps that we have already taken -\r\nincluding the establishment of a Government of National\r\nUnity, the orderly transformation of the institutions of State\r\nand the cultivation of a national consensus on the major\r\nissues of the day - have started us off on a correct footing\r\nwith regard to continuing the processes leading to the\r\ncreation of the just society we have been speaking of.\r\nOur political emancipation has also brought into sharp\r\nfocus the urgent need to engage in the struggle to secure\r\nour people’s freedom from want, from hunger and from\r\nignorance. We have written this on our banners: that the\r\nsociety we seek to create must be a people-centred society;\r\nall its institutions and its resources must be dedicated to the\r\npursuit of a better life for all our citizens. That better life\r\nmust mean an end to poverty, joblessness, homelessness\r\nand the despair that comes of deprivation. This is an end\r\nin itself because the happiness of the human being must, in\r\nany society, be an end in itself.\r\nAt the same time, we are intensely conscious of the\r\nfact that the stability of the democratic settlement itself and\r\nthe possibility actually to create a non-racial and non-sexist\r\nsociety depend on our ability to change the material\r\nconditions of life of our people so that they not only have\r\nthe vote but have bread and work as well.\r\nWe therefore return to the United Nations to make the\r\ncommitment that, as we undertook never to rest until the\r\nsystem of apartheid was defeated, so do we now undertake\r\nthat we cannot rest while millions of our people suffer the\r\npain and indignity of poverty in all its forms.\r\nAt the same time, we turn once more to this world\r\nbody to say \"We are going to need your continued support\r\nto achieve the goal of the betterment of the conditions of\r\nlife of our people.\" We are pleased and inspired that both\r\nthe Secretary-General and the specialized agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations have taken up the development challenge in\r\nSouth Africa with the enthusiasm that they have shown.\r\nWe believe that it is in the common interest that we\r\nsustain the common victory that we have scored in South\r\nAfrica, and take it further by achieving success not only in\r\npolitics but also in the socio-economic sphere.\r\nIt is perhaps common cause among us that everywhere\r\non our globe there is an unmistakable process leading to the\r\nentrenchment of democratic systems of government. The\r\nempowerment of the ordinary people of our world freely\r\nto determine their destiny, unhindered by tyrants and\r\ndictators, is at the very heart of the reason for the\r\nexistence of this Organization.\r\nBut it is equally true that hundreds of millions of\r\nthese politically empowered masses are caught in the\r\ndeathly trap of poverty, unable to live life in its fullness.\r\nOut of all this are born social conflicts which\r\nproduce insecurity and instability, civil and other wars\r\nthat claim many lives, millions of desperate refugees and\r\nthe destruction of the little wealth that poor countries are\r\nable to accumulate. Out of this cauldron are also born\r\ntyrants, dictators and demagogues who not only take away\r\nor restrict the rights of the people but also make it\r\nimpossible to do the things that must be done to bring\r\nlasting prosperity to the people.\r\nAt the same time, the reality can no longer be\r\nignored that we live in an interdependent world which is\r\nbound together to a common destiny. The very response\r\nof the international community to the challenge of\r\napartheid confirmed this very point that we all\r\nunderstood - that so long as apartheid existed in South\r\nAfrica, so long would the whole of humanity feel\r\ndemeaned and degraded.\r\nThe United Nations understood very well that racism\r\nin our country could not but feed racism in other parts of\r\nthe world as well. The universal struggle against\r\napartheid was therefore not an act of charity arising out\r\nof pity for our people, but an affirmation of our common\r\nhumanity. We believe that that act of affirmation requires\r\nthat this Organization should once more turn its focused\r\nand sustained attention to the basics of everything that\r\nmakes for a better world for all humanity.\r\nThe elaboration of a new world order must, of\r\nnecessity, centre on this world body. In it we should find\r\nthe appropriate forum in which we can all participate to\r\nhelp determine the shape of the new world.\r\nThe four elements that will need to be knit together\r\nin fashioning that new universal reality are the issues of\r\ndemocracy, peace, prosperity and interdependence.\r\nThe great challenge of our age to the United Nations\r\nis to answer the question \"Given the interdependence of\r\nthe nations of the world, what is it that we can and must\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\ndo to ensure that democracy, peace and prosperity prevail\r\neverywhere?\"\r\nWe are aware of the fact that the United Nations is\r\naddressing these questions in many ways; yet there can be\r\nno gainsaying the fact that such progress as we have made\r\nhas been made more by stealth than in the bold and\r\ndetermined fashion that the world crisis demands today.\r\nPerhaps a new and forceful initiative is required. Such\r\nan initiative should inspire all of humanity because of the\r\nseriousness of its intent. It should also have a chance to\r\nsucceed because it will have been underwritten by the\r\ncommitment of the masses of the people in each member\r\ncountry to join hands with other nations, to address together\r\nthe related issues of democracy, peace and prosperity in an\r\ninterdependent world.\r\nWe are aware of the fact that the dictates of realpolitik\r\nmilitate against the speedy realization of such an initiative.\r\nBut we do believe that the reality of life and the realism of\r\npolicy will, at some point, bring to the fore the fact that the\r\ndelay we impose on ourselves today will serve only to\r\nincrease the pressure on all of us to incorporate, within\r\nwhat we consider possible, a sustainable vision of a\r\ncommon world that will rise or fall together.\r\nUndoubtedly, to inspire greater confidence in itself\r\namong all the member nations and to reflect better the\r\nimpulse towards the democratization of international\r\nrelations, the United Nations will have to continue looking\r\nat itself to determine what restructuring of itself it should\r\neffect. This process must naturally affect, among others,\r\nthe structure and functioning of the Security Council and\r\nthe peacemaking and peace-keeping issues raised by the\r\nSecretary-General in \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nDemocratic South Africa rejoins the world community\r\nof nations determined to play its role in helping to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations and to contribute what it can\r\nto the furtherance of its purposes. Among other things, we\r\nhave this morning acceded to the covenants and\r\nconventions adopted by this Organization, which address\r\nvarious matters such as economic, social and cultural rights,\r\ncivil and political rights, and the elimination of all forms of\r\nracial discrimination, to say nothing of our irrevocable\r\ncommitment to the realization of the objectives contained\r\nin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nWe are determined to play our full part in all\r\nprocesses that address the important question of the\r\nnon-proliferation and elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Our Government has also decided to become\r\na signatory to the Convention on prohibition and\r\nrestrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons.\r\nIn a similar vein, we shall not be found wanting in\r\nthe quest for sustainable development that is in keeping\r\nwith the Rio de Janeiro Declaration on Environment and\r\nDevelopment as well as with Agenda 21.\r\nEqually, our own national interest dictates that we\r\njoin forces with the United Nations and all its Member\r\nStates in the common struggle to contain and end the\r\ntraffic in narcotics.\r\nEven in constitutional terms, we are committed to\r\nthe advancement of the objective of the emancipation of\r\nwomen through the creation of a non-sexist society.\r\nApart from anything else, we are therefore actively\r\nengaged in the preparations for what we are convinced\r\nwill be a successful Beijing Conference.\r\nWe are part of the region of southern Africa and the\r\ncontinent of Africa. As members of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community and the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), and an equal partner with other Member\r\nStates, we will play our role in the struggles of these\r\norganizations to build a continent and a region that will\r\nhelp to create for themselves and all humanity a common\r\nworld of peace and prosperity.\r\nOurs must become a continent free of such tragedies\r\nas those that have afflicted our own country as well as\r\nRwanda, Somalia, Angola, Mozambique, the Sudan and\r\nLiberia. Happily, the OAU is actively addressing the\r\nissues of peace and stability on our continent.\r\nWe are greatly encouraged that the countries of our\r\nregion, faced with a crisis in Lesotho, acted together\r\nspeedily and, with the cooperation of the Government and\r\nthe people of that country, succeeded in demonstrating\r\nthat together we have the will to defend democracy, peace\r\nand national reconciliation.\r\nFurthermore, as members of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and the Group of 77, we are committed\r\nespecially to the promotion of South-South cooperation\r\nand to the strengthening of the voice of the poor and\r\ndisadvantaged in the ordering of world affairs.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour appreciation to the members of the General Assembly\r\nfor the speed and readiness with which they accepted the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\ncredentials of democratic South Africa, enabling us to\r\nparticipate in the work of the last General Assembly. We\r\nare pleased to note that this same spirit characterized the\r\napproach of other international organizations towards our\r\nnew democracy, including the Commonwealth and the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nWe would like to close by congratulating you, Mr.\r\nPresident, on your election to your high post, and we\r\nexpress our confidence that you will guide the work of the\r\nAssembly with the wisdom and sense of purpose for which\r\nwe admire you.\r\nThe millions across our globe who stand expectant at\r\nthe gates of hope look to this Organization to bring them\r\npeace, to bring them life, to bring them a life worth living.\r\nWe pray that the new South Africa, which the General\r\nAssembly helped bring into being and so warmly welcomed\r\namong the community of nations, will, in its own and in the\r\nwider interest, make its own contribution, however small,\r\nto the realization of those hopes.\r\nOur common humanity and the urgency of the knock\r\non the door of this great edifice demand that we must\r\nattempt even the impossible.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of South Africa for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Nelson Rorihlahla Mandela, President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nMr. Vílchez Asher (Nicaragua), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nTentative Programme of Work\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I should\r\nlike to draw the attention of the General Assembly to\r\ndocument A/INF/49/5, which contains a tentative\r\nprogramme of work and a tentative schedule of plenary\r\nmeetings for the month of October. I should like to point\r\nout that this schedule was prepared to facilitate the\r\norganization of the work of delegations and to help ensure\r\nthat the relevant documentation is ready for the discussion\r\nof the items in question.\r\nThe lists of speakers for all the items listed in\r\ndocument A/INF/49/5 are now open.\r\nIn due course the President will announce the dates\r\nof the consideration of other agenda items and keep the\r\nAssembly informed of any additions or changes.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nnext speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nHungary, His Excellency Mr. László Kovács.\r\nMr. Kovács (Hungary): Allow me to extend to Mr.\r\nAmara Essy my delegation’s warmest congratulations\r\nupon his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session. He may rest assured\r\nthat the Hungarian delegation stands ready to assist him\r\nin carrying out his responsible tasks. Sincere words of\r\nrecognition should also go to Ambassador Insanally, the\r\noutgoing President, for the outstanding and\r\nforward-looking manner in which he conducted the work\r\nof the previous session of the Assembly.\r\nAs a representative of the newly elected coalition\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Hungary, may I be\r\npermitted first to assure this Assembly of nations that in\r\nits foreign policy Hungary will continue to serve the\r\ncause of international peace and stability, with special\r\nregard to the Central European region. We are committed\r\nto further developing our political and economic\r\ntransformation in order to consolidate democracy and\r\nstabilize the market economy in Hungary.\r\nOur foreign policy rests on three closely interrelated\r\nmain pillars, which we treat on an equal footing. First,\r\nwe are determined to promote the full integration of\r\nHungary into the Euro-Atlantic institutions. Secondly, we\r\nseek genuine good-neighbourly relations with all the\r\ncountries in our region, especially with countries\r\nbordering ours. And, thirdly, we advocate respect for\r\nhuman rights, with particular emphasis on the minority\r\nrights of the millions of Hungarians who live beyond our\r\nborders. All in all, we intend to conduct our foreign\r\npolicy in a most pragmatic and realistic manner and will\r\nact accordingly in our bilateral relations and in\r\nmultilateral forums as well.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nOn the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, and in the present post-cold-war era,\r\nmankind is facing enormous challenges. The euphoria we\r\nfelt and the great expectations we entertained only\r\nyesterday, when a new and promising world seemed to be\r\nemerging, have now taken on a bitter quality.\r\nAs the bipolar world was falling apart and freedom\r\nand democracy were sweeping across the globe we had to\r\nrecognize some negative aspects of those fundamental\r\nchanges, such as the outbreak of violent nationalism and\r\nethnic hatred fed by economic and social tensions. The\r\ninternational community, and notably the United Nations,\r\nhas proved sometimes unable - and on a number of\r\noccasions its Member States unwilling - to meet the\r\ndramatic challenges of our times.\r\nNew and violent manifestations of intolerance, which\r\ncaught the world unprepared, aggressive wars and bloody\r\nethnic conflicts accompanied by crimes against humanity\r\nand the abhorrent practice of \"ethnic cleansing\" are today\r\nunanimously considered issues that ought to have been\r\ntackled in a timely and resolute way. It is with deep regret\r\nthat we note that the United Nations, together with other\r\nrelevant international organizations, instead of preventing\r\nthe outbreak of crises in a number of areas of the world,\r\nhas, rather, been trying to react to them, either without the\r\nnecessary determination or by belated action. Indisputably,\r\nthe means available to the Organization for coming to grips\r\nwith the many international problems were stretched far\r\nbeyond existing capacities. We believe, however, that the\r\ntime has come to take a good hard look at the role the\r\nUnited Nations is called upon to play and to devise new\r\nways and means by which it can fulfil its raison d’être in\r\nour troubled contemporary world.\r\nWe therefore reinforce our support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Agenda for Peace and continue to regard it as a\r\nforward-oriented plan of action for the years to come. In\r\nthis regard, we consider that special efforts should be made\r\nto resolve the problems facing United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations, with a view to improving their\r\nefficiency and capability.\r\nIn the event we are unable to find adequate answers to\r\nour failures and missed opportunities, we may well be on\r\nthe verge of losing the precious benefits we have gained\r\nand the potential prospects that opened up at the end of the\r\ncold war for the international community, including the\r\nUnited Nations, to create a qualitatively new, cooperative\r\nworld order.\r\nAs has often been stated, we live in a time of great\r\ncontrasts that are also reflected at the United Nations.\r\nWe welcome the momentous results and encouraging\r\nprogress in South Africa just outlined by His Excellency\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela, as well as those in the Middle\r\nEast. The assumption of office by the first democratically\r\nelected President and Government of South Africa and its\r\nnormalization of relations with its neighbours, the signing\r\nof the Declaration of Principles by Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and the beginning of its\r\nimplementation, the breakthrough in relations between\r\nJordan and Israel and the hopeful evolution of talks\r\nbetween Syria and Israel, are all truly historic\r\nachievements and bode well for the future.\r\nThe forthcoming 1995 Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\nwill be an event of cardinal importance which can further\r\nenhance the aforesaid positive tendencies. Hungary is\r\nkeenly interested in ensuring the indefinite and\r\nunconditional extension of the Treaty and is ready to\r\ncontribute to achieving this important goal. Recent events\r\nhave once again reinforced our conviction with regard to\r\nthe critical significance of such an act.\r\nIf the United Nations wants to live up to the\r\npromising processes, it must, first of all, adjust itself to\r\nthe new realities. It would, therefore, do well to get rid\r\nof outdated, anachronistic resolutions which have nothing\r\nmore to do with present-day developments.\r\nIt must, however, be admitted that attempts to tackle\r\ncrises in the former Yugoslavia, in Somalia, in Rwanda\r\nand elsewhere have not yielded conclusive evidence of\r\nthe ability of the United Nations to find the right answers\r\nto major hotbeds of tension.\r\nBecause of its geographical proximity, Hungary has\r\nfollowed with particularly grave concern the devastation\r\nand suffering across its southern borders, first and\r\nforemost in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia. We\r\nhave supported to the best of our abilities the efforts of\r\nthe international community aimed at finding a just\r\nsolution to that human drama. The basis for the solution\r\nof this unprecedented crisis in the heart of Europe exists.\r\nThe principles of the United Nations Charter and those\r\nadopted by the International Conference on Yugoslavia\r\nare there. They include respect for the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of countries, the inadmissibility of\r\nacquisition of territory by force, the elimination of the\r\nconsequences of \"ethnic cleansing\", the return of refugees\r\nand displaced persons and the protection of human rights,\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nincluding the rights of minorities. These principles should\r\nnever be ignored if we are to reach a just and lasting\r\nsettlement in Bosnia, Croatia and elsewhere.\r\nHungary has a vital stake in the restoration of peace\r\nand international legality in the former Yugoslavia. The\r\nvolatile situation of the sizeable Hungarian ethnic\r\ncommunity in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia\r\nand Montenegro), the interruption of traditionally close\r\neconomic ties with our southern neighbours, the serious\r\nlosses we have suffered as a consequence of the sanctions\r\nregime imposed by the Security Council on the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, all inspire us towards an active\r\ninvolvement in the search for a durable and equitable\r\nsettlement in those tortured lands. In achieving that goal\r\nwe expect the international community to uphold the\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and to\r\nenforce the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nWe also expect that appropriate ways will be found in the\r\ncourse of post-conflict peace-building there to alleviate the\r\nburden of losses incurred as a result of the sanctions regime\r\nby the countries most directly affected, such as Hungary.\r\nHungary is following with keen interest the\r\nencouraging process of the revitalization of the United\r\nNations. In this respect, I wish to reaffirm that we attach\r\nparticular importance to the question of the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council with a view to ensuring its transparency,\r\nrepresentative character and effective functioning, in order\r\nto better reflect the realities of our contemporary world. In\r\nthis context we fully concur with others in supporting\r\npermanent membership in the Security Council for\r\nGermany and Japan.\r\nHungary welcomes the ever-growing recognition that\r\nin maintaining international peace and security regional\r\norganizations should be given a more decisive role. In our\r\nview, the time has come to work out the necessary\r\narrangements whereby regional organizations can effectively\r\ncontribute to conflict resolution, namely, preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking and post-conflict\r\npeace-building. We endorse the proposition that by\r\ninvolving the regional organizations under the umbrella of\r\nthe United Nations, and in particular of the Security\r\nCouncil, in the safeguarding or restoration of international\r\npeace and security, our world can indeed be made a much\r\nsafer place. We, for our part, are prepared to share in\r\nefforts at securing wider participatory action.\r\nThis autumn Hungary is honoured to act as host in\r\nBudapest of the next Review Conference and summit\r\nmeeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE). We expect the Conference and the\r\nsummit meeting not only to contribute to the better\r\nfunctioning of this important regional arrangement but\r\nalso to serve as a useful vehicle in the efforts towards a\r\ndemocratic and integrated Europe where rationalism may\r\nprevail over nationalism. Furthermore, we are convinced\r\nthat success within the CSCE is not only beneficial to the\r\npeoples living in the CSCE region but that it can also\r\nunderpin efforts at conflict prevention and crisis\r\nresolution in other parts of the world. In this context we\r\nbelieve that the realization of the Dutch-German proposal\r\nto establish a genuine and practical division of\r\nresponsibilities between the CSCE and the United Nations\r\nin the settlement of conflicts within the CSCE region,\r\nwhile upholding the principles and provisions embodied\r\nin the relevant chapters of the United Nations Charter,\r\ncould well be a major step forward.\r\nFollowing the Budapest Summit, when Hungary is\r\nto take over for a year the duties of the\r\nchairmanship-in-office of the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), I personally intend to pay\r\nparticular attention to the consolidation of mutually\r\nadvantageous cooperation between the CSCE and the\r\nUnited Nations which is so promisingly unfolding.\r\nPromotion and protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms are a high priority of Hungary’s\r\nforeign policy. In this connection, I would like to recall\r\nthat in the Vienna Declaration of the World Conference\r\non Human Rights it was solemnly stated that the\r\npromotion and protection of all human rights is a\r\nlegitimate concern of the international community.\r\nConsequently, we find it indispensable that, in this spirit,\r\nthe United Nations should act in the defence of human\r\nrights, irrespective of where violations of those rights\r\noccur.\r\nIn our world of interdependence and growing\r\ninteraction, Hungary calls for the development by the\r\nUnited Nations of an integrated response-capacity to\r\ncombat the repeated waves of human rights violations.\r\nWe view with serious concern the alarming increases in\r\nthe reported cases of gross violations of human rights, as\r\nwell as the frequent occurrence of such violations in\r\nsituations of internal armed conflicts or ethnic strife.\r\nThese developments have serious repercussions affecting\r\npeace, security and stability in the given region and\r\nbeyond. In this regard, we should be mindful of the\r\nrequirements laid down in the Vienna Declaration for all\r\nGovernments to promote and protect human rights in their\r\nown countries, regardless of their political, economic and\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\ncultural structures. On the one hand, an open and active\r\ndialogue, simultaneously constructive and critical, needs to\r\nbe established and sustained in order to promote the\r\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. On\r\nthe other hand, a stronger commitment to economic and\r\nsocial development in various areas of the world would\r\nconsiderably facilitate the observance of these universal\r\nvalues.\r\nBy the same token, we believe that the United Nations\r\nhas not yet exhausted the means available for the\r\ninternational protection of human rights. We urge the\r\ninternational community to seek new and innovative means\r\nand methods to safeguard the rights and freedoms of our\r\nfellow human beings, wherever they may live. We wish to\r\nsee the United Nations embark in a timely manner - within\r\nthe framework of preventive diplomacy - upon the road of\r\ninternational protection of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms. Rather than responding only to reported human\r\nrights violations, the United Nations should build effective\r\npreventive mechanisms into its activities whenever the need\r\narises. The notion of preventive protection should also\r\ninclude adequate international monitoring.\r\nFollowing decisions of the competent organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, such as the Security Council or the\r\nCommission on Human Rights, civilian human rights\r\nmonitors could be deployed if in any part of the world the\r\nhuman rights situation so warranted. Hungary, for its part,\r\nis prepared to participate with monitors in joint actions of\r\nthe international community in this field.\r\nIn these endeavours, we also count on the effective\r\nparticipation of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nThe High Commissioner has had our full support ever since\r\nhe assumed his office, and we pledge our cooperation in the\r\ncarrying out of all aspects of his mandate. We would like\r\nto reiterate that adequate financing of the human rights\r\nactivities of the United Nations should be ensured through\r\nthe regular budget.\r\nI cannot conclude without mentioning the issue of\r\nsustainable development, with its many aspects covering\r\nindustrial and agricultural development, trade, human\r\nresources, regional cooperation, protection of the\r\nenvironment, and so forth. Clearly, what is at stake here is\r\nour ability to tackle these global issues without delay. The\r\ngrowing sensitivity with regard to these questions cannot\r\nbut be welcome. We consider the work of the United\r\nNations Conference on Population and Development, held\r\nrecently in Cairo, to be an important step in that direction\r\nat a time when contrasts between requirements of human\r\ndevelopment and limited resources are becoming more\r\nand more evident.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that Hungary\r\ncontinues to be a strong supporter of multilateralism.\r\nNations are looking to this Organization for protection\r\nand assistance. We must not let them down in these\r\ncritical times. In spite of failures, we should keep faith\r\nwith the United Nations and meet the challenges which,\r\nin the final analysis, will determine mankind’s destiny in\r\nthe new millennium.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Minister of Commerce of India, His\r\nExcellency Shri Pranab Mukherjee.\r\nMr. Mukherjee (India): I congratulate Mr.\r\nAmara Essy on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at the forty-ninth session. We are particularly\r\ngratified that an eminent son of Africa is leading the\r\nAssembly’s deliberations this year.\r\nWe offer our thanks to his predecessor, Ambassador\r\nInsanally, who presided over a year of considerable\r\nactivity in the General Assembly with great aplomb and\r\nfinesse. The Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, will be completing three years in office.\r\nWe wish him well as he continues to lead the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe have already welcomed the new South Africa to\r\nthe United Nations. South Africa today is a reminder of\r\nthe triumph of the principle of equality of man - a\r\ntriumph in which the United Nations played a major role.\r\nThe world community must commit itself to ensuring that\r\nthis principle is implemented for all time to come. All\r\nefforts should be made for the development of South\r\nAfrica.\r\nForty-nine years ago a world tired of war declared\r\nthat at this foundry of the United Nations it would beat its\r\nswords into ploughshares. Instead, we have only\r\nproduced words, while the swords have not disappeared.\r\nThe words may be important, but unfortunately they have\r\nremained mere words. We seem to be stepping into a\r\nnew world order in a gaping moral void, with no credible\r\npromise of peace nor of a nonviolent world. And we are\r\napproaching 1995: the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations; the fortieth anniversary of Panchsheel - the Five\r\nPrinciples of Peaceful Coexistence; the Year of Tolerance,\r\nwhich is being celebrated by the United Nations; and the\r\none hundred and twenty-fifth birthday of the apostle of\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\npeace and moral force, Mahatma Gandhi, whose message\r\nonly gains in relevance year after year.\r\nGlobal security today demands a holistic approach\r\ninvolving the promotion of economic and social\r\ndevelopment; the protection of human rights; the promotion\r\nof harmony and social cohesion in multi-racial and\r\nmulti-ethnic societies; the combating of terrorism,\r\ndrug-trafficking and clandestine traffic in armaments; and\r\nthe enhancing of the capacity of the United Nations, within\r\nthe framework of its Charter, to prevent conflicts, preserve\r\npeace and alleviate suffering. The new agenda of the\r\nUnited Nations must be shaped on the basis of this\r\napproach, giving peace and development equal priority and\r\ntreatment. The General Assembly, with its universal\r\nparticipation and comprehensive mandate, should project\r\nsuch a holistic vision and revitalize that vision into action.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s Agendas have reminded us\r\nof what we should focus on, namely, disarmament,\r\ndevelopment and peace. I put them in that order because\r\ntrue peace can only follow disarmament and development.\r\nThe cold war was not war, yet certainly not peace. In its\r\nwake, we have seen how, most frighteningly, poverty,\r\ndisease and a host of miseries affect the cause of peace.\r\nThey had been there all the time, but were not seen by the\r\njaundiced eye of the cold war. In the new post-cold-war\r\ncontext, therefore, the nexus of disarmament and\r\ndevelopment with peace becomes crystal clear - indeed\r\ninescapably clear.\r\nWe have to start with disarmament. The slaughter in\r\nRwanda has taken place during the forty-ninth anniversary\r\nof the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For almost\r\n50 years, we have lived in fear of general and complete\r\nextinction instead of global and complete disarmament.\r\nThose who had biological and chemical weapons have\r\ngiven them up under universally binding commitments. We\r\nmust now go one logical step further and exorcise the\r\ngreatest evil of all, namely, the weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nWe have had global discussions on nuclear\r\ndisarmament before, but now that the cold war, which\r\nspawned these weapons, is over, and the previous\r\nadversaries have been drawn into a partnership for peace,\r\nthis is surely the time to agree - in regimes which are\r\nglobal, comprehensive, verifiable and non-discriminatory -\r\non steps to make the world a safer place. Another\r\nopportunity will arise when the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) comes up for\r\nreview next April. We hope that States Parties will use that\r\noccasion to refashion the Treaty into a real instrument for\r\nglobal disarmament. Quite apart from the NPT, it is\r\nessential that we examine a detailed implementation\r\nprocess of total and global disarmament, which has been\r\naccepted in principle, though in words only thus far.\r\nLast June in Cairo, the Foreign Ministers of the non-\r\naligned countries, at India’s suggestion, proposed that a\r\nfourth special session on disarmament be convened. We\r\nthink the time and the circumstances are right for the\r\nGeneral Assembly to plan for this special session for next\r\nyear, or as soon as possible.\r\nBut disarmament alone will be inadequate. We are\r\nrushing towards another precipice, where the disparities\r\nin wealth between nations would trigger violent revolution\r\nwithin States. A global convulsion will come if we\r\ncontinue to disregard the development imperative. The\r\nproblems of development are global problems and must\r\nbe addressed by all of us. We must set a substantive\r\nagenda for development, commit ourselves to it and\r\nimplement it.\r\nThe World Trade Organization, which should soon\r\ncome into being, must promote what we expected but did\r\nnot quite achieve so far in the General Agreement on\r\nTariffs and Trade (GATT) - non-discrimination,\r\nconsensus and transparency in the international trade\r\nregime. We hope that the multilateral trade negotiations\r\nwill stimulate economic growth in our countries and in\r\nthe world economy. It will not if the carefully negotiated\r\nconsensus, to which we committed ourselves at\r\nMarrakesh, is destroyed by the introduction of new\r\nconditionalities. Faith in the multilateral system will be\r\nshaken if countries use their trading strength and bilateral\r\npressures to weaken and distort agreements to which they\r\nhave just become parties.\r\nThe themes of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment focus on the critical issues of poverty\r\neradication together with social integration and the need\r\nto increase avenues for productive employment, without\r\nwhich we will not have the broad-based, self-sustaining\r\nsocial and economic development that is the only\r\nguarantor of peace and security. If the Summit is to\r\nsucceed, we must agree upon the commitments for\r\nadditional resources dedicated to national programmes\r\naround the world. We should not be sidetracked from\r\nthis goal by new concepts which do not command\r\nconsensus, and do not address the fundamental needs of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nThe United Nations must also re-order its priorities so\r\nas to counter several disturbing centrifugal trends which we\r\nsee emerging. What the world needs is support for the\r\nnation-State system on which the United Nations was built.\r\nIn June this year, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and\r\nPresident Yeltsin, representing two of the largest pluralistic\r\nnations in the world, issued the Moscow Declaration on the\r\nProtection of the Interests of Pluralistic States. In this\r\nDeclaration, which has been circulated as a document of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Russia and India have put forward\r\nprinciples which, if acted upon, will, we think, promote\r\ngreater harmony in the world.\r\nAgainst this background, there are a few questions for\r\nthe Assembly to consider. For the 45 years of the cold\r\nwar, the Security Council was forced into immobility, but\r\nwhen the cold war ended, it found itself shouldering a\r\nstupendous task. As if to make up for years of inactivity,\r\nit has rushed into many areas. We must ponder the\r\nconsequences of the decisions taken over the last few years,\r\nwhich have on occasion sent United Nations peace-keepers\r\nin pursuit of objectives whose nexus with peace is rather\r\ntenuous.\r\nNew doctrines justify armed United Nations\r\nintervention under circumstances that are not quite defined -\r\nnot yet at any rate. These initiatives are well meaning but\r\nthey do not seem to address the problems from the right\r\nend. The ultimate human right is the right to live - the\r\nright to food and shelter without which life is impossible.\r\nThe poverty of many nations makes this a problem to\r\nwhich there are no easy answers. If there are\r\ncircumstances which justify armed multilateral intervention,\r\nby the same logic should not the United Nations have the\r\nright to enforce the equitable sharing of resources among\r\nnations?\r\nThe Non-aligned Movement, at the meeting of its\r\nForeign Ministers in Cairo this year, suggested some\r\nguiding principles for peace-keeping operations of enduring\r\nsignificance. All means for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes chosen by the conflicting parties should be\r\nexhausted before coercive measures are considered.\r\nPeace-keeping operations should strictly adhere to the\r\nprinciples of the Charter, in particular the principles of full\r\nrespect for the sovereignty of States, their territorial\r\nintegrity and non-intervention in their internal affairs.\r\nPeace-keeping operations should be considered only at the\r\nrequest of the Member States involved. The resources for\r\npeace-keeping activities should not be at the expense of\r\nresources for development activities of the United Nations.\r\nThere should be no hesitation in ending those operations\r\nwhich have been overtaken by events or become\r\ninconsistent with their mandates. It is also important to\r\nensure that the distinction between peace-keeping\r\noperations and other activities of the United Nations,\r\nincluding humanitarian assistance, is maintained at all\r\ntimes. While coordination between these activities at the\r\nfield level is important, their integration could irreversibly\r\nalter the basic purposes of these distinct activities and\r\ndetract from their effectiveness.\r\nPrudence must be exercised in the use of regional\r\norganizations in peace-keeping operations. It is the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations for peace-keeping that\r\nmust be strengthened.\r\nWe have responded positively to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s appeal for the strengthening of the United\r\nNations capacity for peace-keeping by designating a\r\nbrigade for the stand-by arrangements that are being put\r\nin place.\r\nIt is true that the work of the Security Council and\r\nits role in the United Nations are of the greatest\r\nimportance. There is therefore all the more reason that\r\nthe Council should be representative of the international\r\ncommunity and have maximum legitimacy. The United\r\nNations needs a Council that is effective, but it cannot be\r\neffective if the impression grows that it represents\r\nentrenched privileges and that its agenda could vary from\r\nthose of the general membership. The democracy and\r\ngood governance which are urged upon all States cannot\r\nstop at the gates of the United Nations.\r\nThe present-day composition of the Security Council\r\nreflects the power balance of the immediate post-war\r\nperiod. Since then, the membership of the world body\r\nhas increased many times over. There is also a greater\r\ndiffusion of power. To give the Council’s actions greater\r\nlegitimacy, moral authority and political effectiveness, it\r\nis imperative to expand the membership of the Council.\r\nDeveloping countries must be included in the category of\r\npermanent members to reflect the universal character of\r\nthe world body. The number of non-permanent seats\r\nmust also be increased to give Member States greater\r\nopportunity for participation in the work of the Council.\r\nA selective, piecemeal expansion of the number of\r\npermanent members would not be prudent. The Security\r\nCouncil is not a corporate board, where equity shares\r\ndetermine the voting power, nor can it be likened to the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, which reflect the wealth of\r\nnations. The United Nations is based on the principle of\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nthe sovereign equality of nations. Its primary objective\r\nremains the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThese elements must find expression in the composition of\r\nthe Council, which must be able to address the challenges\r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nDurability and resilience, rather than expediency,\r\nshould determine the time frame of any expansion. On the\r\nbasis of any criteria - population, size of economy,\r\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity and to peace-keeping or future potential - India\r\ndeserves to be a permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe working methods of the Security Council must be\r\nreformed to enhance transparency and to express the\r\ndemocratic aspirations of the vast majority of Member\r\nStates. We hope that the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nthe question of increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil will duly reflect on these issues in its deliberations\r\nnext year.\r\nHuman rights are the new vogue. The profoundly\r\nhumanistic traditions of the Indian civilization, with its\r\nemphasis on tolerance, harmony, non-violence and the\r\ninviolability of the individual, are in-built in our ethos.\r\nSeveral centuries back, an Indian thinker wrote:\r\n\"Man is above everything else. Man is the highest\r\ntruth. There is nothing above man.\"\r\nAll human rights are sacrosanct in India, guaranteed\r\nby a secular Constitution, an independent judiciary, a free\r\npress, and public opinion vigorously expressed. India’s\r\ncommitment to the promotion and protection of human\r\nrights has now received another institutional impetus with\r\nthe establishment of our National Human Rights\r\nCommission, which has begun to function effectively, with\r\nits findings published in its annual report. In keeping with\r\nour policy of transparency we maintain a sustained dialogue\r\nwith important non-governmental organizations, which\r\nincludes affording greater access to them. We have also\r\ninvited the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights to visit India.\r\nIt is true that much remains to be done on a\r\nworldwide basis to further international cooperation to\r\npromote and protect human rights. But the problem must\r\nbe seen in perspective. In India, for instance, we grapple\r\nwith the problems of development for 900 million people;\r\nin the north-west and in the north-east we face brutal\r\nterrorist movements, often supported from abroad, which\r\nhave killed thousands of innocents, made refugees of\r\nhundreds of thousands within India, and threatened our\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We will face these\r\nproblems and defeat them. We welcome the support and\r\nadvice of friends abroad, but we cannot accept the\r\nposition that all human rights are a privilege of the\r\nterrorists. The rights of innocent and unarmed citizens\r\nmust be protected. We urge that the question of human\r\nrights should not be made into a politically motivated\r\nslogan insensitive to the rights of those citizens.\r\nSince the toxin of terrorism is deliberately being\r\nspread by some countries - and none of us is immune -\r\nthe international community must come together to defend\r\nitself. Terrorism is fast becoming a means, if not a\r\nweapon, of mass destruction. Many countries have\r\nsuffered and many more could be affected. Terrorists\r\nhave killed far more people in the last decades than the\r\nchemical and biological weapons which we have agreed\r\nto ban and destroy. Just as the international community\r\ndecided that a convention was needed to outlaw those\r\nweapons, so it must urgently negotiate a convention to\r\ncounter and eradicate terrorism. We urge the General\r\nAssembly to initiate serious thinking on this subject. The\r\ninternational community must also provide the necessary\r\nsuccour to the victims of terrorism, whose numbers are\r\nswelling by the day.\r\nThe closing years of the twentieth century will see\r\nhuman society poised at a critical juncture as regards the\r\nfuture. Will the end of the cold war mark the beginnings\r\nof a new, more stable global order, of freedom and\r\nwell-being growing on the soil of cooperation, consensus\r\nand mutual respect, or will the world instead revert bit by\r\nbit to the mind-set which breeds anarchy and a return to\r\ncentrifugalism and destruction, to end up once again in\r\nthe tyranny of imposition and domination? Should we\r\nregress to the system of spheres of influence which has\r\nled to so many wars over the last two hundred years?\r\nThese questions have still not been adequately answered.\r\nMany years ago the father of our nation, Mahatma\r\nGandhi, had asked what test should guide human\r\nendeavour. His conclusion, after long years of struggling\r\non behalf of India’s many dispossessed millions, was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\"I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in\r\ndoubt, or when the self becomes too much with you,\r\napply the following test: Recall the face of the\r\npoorest and the weakest man whom you may have\r\nseen, and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\ngoing to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything\r\nby it? Will it restore him to a control over his own\r\nlife and destiny?\"\r\nIf the protection afforded to its weak, its most\r\ndispossessed, people is the measure of community’s worth,\r\nas indeed it must be, then the millions of refugees, and the\r\nconflict, poverty, hunger and deprivation that afflict so\r\nmany regions of the world today bear stark testimony to the\r\nloss of some vital ethical underpinning. If the world today\r\nis to redeem a future that seems increasingly mortgaged to\r\ngreed and hatred, we must recall once again that it is the\r\nnobility of our means, and the ends we pursue, that\r\ndetermine our rewards. Our welfare will be determined\r\nonly in accordance with the values and principles we abide\r\nby.\r\nAs Mahatma Gandhi and sages before have taught and\r\npractised, truthfulness, charity, compassion, non-violence\r\nand treating others as we would wish ourselves to be\r\ntreated are the values that really stand the test of time.\r\nThese are the values to be inculcated in our great global\r\nOrganization, the United Nations, to which we are all\r\ncommitted.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic, His Excellency Mr. Farouk Al-Shara.\r\nMr. Al-Shara (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): I should like to congratulate Mr. Essy on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and to express our appreciation of the\r\ngreat responsibilities he will be shouldering, together with\r\nthe Secretary-General, in preparing for the commemoration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI also take this opportunity to salute, on behalf of my\r\ncountry, Syria, the long and arduous struggle of Africa\r\nagainst the system of apartheid in South Africa. This\r\nstruggle, recently crowned with the establishment of a\r\nunited, democratic and non-racial Republic of South Africa,\r\nis a triumph not only for Africa but also for humanity and\r\nthe international community as a whole. It is especially a\r\ntriumph for the United Nations as it is one of its most\r\nimportant achievements. This great accomplishment will\r\nremain forever a source of inspiration and optimism for us\r\nall that all forms of racism are inevitably doomed to\r\nextinction.\r\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations will raise fundamental questions about the\r\nrole and achievements of the Organization and the\r\nobstacles it has faced and continues to face. In our\r\nopinion, the most important question will focus on the\r\nreform and restructuring of the United Nations to make it\r\nmore democratic and thus more capable of responding to\r\nthe major changes that have taken place on the\r\ninternational scene, particularly since the end of the cold\r\nwar.\r\nIt seems that none of the Member States objects in\r\nprinciple to the idea of introducing reforms to the United\r\nNations, including the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil’s membership. However, the question that could\r\ntake years before any agreement is reached on it is that\r\nwhich relates to the nature of the required reforms, the\r\ncriteria for choosing the new members of the Security\r\nCouncil and, first and foremost, the right of veto:\r\nwhether to expand it or abolish it altogether from the\r\nCharter.\r\nMore than two-thirds of the current Members of the\r\nUnited Nations did not participate in drafting the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, either because they were\r\nlanguishing under colonialism or because, after\r\nindependence, they were thrust into the cold war, for\r\nwhich the United Nations was an important arena. In this\r\ncontext, developing countries pose the following question:\r\nIf colonialism is truly a thing of the past and if the cold\r\nwar is indeed over, what other reasons are there to\r\nprevent the developing countries from actively\r\nparticipating in the restructuring of the United Nations\r\nand from taking the share they are democratically entitled\r\nto in the Security Council’s membership?\r\nWe hope that the answer will not be a negative one\r\nand that the cold war will no longer be waged in new\r\ninnovative forms and under different pretexts. That\r\nwould be in no one’s interest and would serve no useful\r\npurpose, either in the short or in the long term. Today’s\r\nworld, North and South, East and West, faces\r\nunparalleled challenges that require the cooperation of all\r\nMember States in facing up to them. Those challenges\r\nmay initially appear to be of a minor nature, but they may\r\nwell grow and spread like a plague.\r\nIn many continents, dozens of civil wars have been\r\nspawned from the womb of the cold war. The causes of\r\nthese wars are many: national, ethnic, religious and\r\ntribal. Their victims are hundreds of thousands, while the\r\nrefugees and displaced persons they uproot are in the tens\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nof millions. The number of those who live below the\r\npoverty line in the world today has reached almost one fifth\r\nof the inhabitants of the globe. About 90 per cent of those\r\nlive in developing countries.\r\nA phenomenon that seems truly odd and surprising is\r\nthe spread of organized crime to countries where such a\r\nphenomenon was never known before. Organized crime\r\nnow has its own international networks, its secret\r\ntransnational organizations are estimated to be in the\r\nthousands. Such organizations have the ability to break the\r\nmost rigorous of laws by all the illegitimate means\r\navailable to them, including the smuggling of nuclear\r\ncomponents and their scientific designs.\r\nThe indispensable international cooperation needed to\r\nmeet such varied challenges cannot achieve the desired\r\nresults if certain of its principal parties take to evoking the\r\nspirit of the cold war by calling up the past instead of\r\nlooking forward to the future or if they act under the\r\ninfluence of some racist background that inspires their\r\npropaganda or election campaigns. It is no exaggeration to\r\nsay that such elements and subjective motives have already\r\nplayed a role in obstructing international efforts to address\r\na number of serious crises, particularly those in which\r\nhuman suffering has reached levels that defy description\r\nand stymie the imagination, as in the cases of Bosnia,\r\nSomalia and Rwanda, not to mention Afghanistan, where\r\nthe shortsightedness of the conflicting parties has\r\noverwhelmed all wisdom and prudence.\r\nOn the other hand, however, we must commend the\r\nUnited States of America for resorting to political dialogue\r\nwith the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and with\r\nCuba instead of continuing to pursue its policy of\r\nconfrontation against them. These are positive measures\r\nwhich we hope will continue and expand to encompass\r\nother issues, in the forefront of which is that of Lockerbie\r\ndisaster and Libya, so that political dialogue will become\r\nthe most appropriate option inresolving disputes between\r\nStates. In the same vein, we hope that the United Arab\r\nEmirates and Iran will be able, through amicable dialogue,\r\nto reach a satisfactory solution to the question of the\r\ndisputed islands that would preserve the rights of both\r\nparties and consolidate friendly relations between the two\r\nneighbours.\r\nSyria was one of the first States in the Middle East to\r\nsign, as early as 1968, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In doing so, Syria was\r\nprompted by its conviction that the possession of such an\r\noverkill weapon by any State in our highly sensitive region\r\nwould be a major cause for concern, not only to the\r\npeoples of the region, but also to the world at large. At\r\nthe time, Syria expected that its early signing of the NPT\r\nwould be an incentive to Israel, sooner or later, to sign in\r\nturn and would dissuade it from possessing nuclear\r\nweapons. Regrettably, we were to discover that our\r\nexpectations were not justified. Israel, as yet, has neither\r\nadhered to the NPT, nor agreed to open its nuclear\r\ninstallations to international inspection.\r\nOnce again, and on the occasion of the Paris\r\nConference on Banning of Chemical Weapons in January\r\n1989, Syria took the initiative to call for making the\r\nMiddle East a region free of all nuclear, chemical and\r\nbiological weapons of mass destruction within the\r\nframework of the United Nations. However, Israel did\r\nnot respond to this call nor did it respond to any of the\r\ncalls of the United Nations, the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency or those of the Conferences of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement or the Islamic Conference.\r\nThis is an issue that has become of the utmost\r\nimportance and gravity, particularly in the light of the\r\nongoing peace process in the Middle East. It is not\r\nacceptable for any one party to have a privileged or\r\nexceptional position at the expense of others in regard to\r\nsensitive and decisive matters that relate to regional\r\nsecurity which ought to be based on co-equality and\r\nmutuality.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe forthcoming conference of the States Parties to\r\nthe NPT scheduled to review the extension of its tenure\r\nwhich is about to expire, affords a rare opportunity for all\r\nStates in the region to demonstrate their peaceful\r\nintentions.\r\nThe accession by all States in the Middle East to the\r\nNPT is a vital step towards transforming the Middle East\r\nto a region free of all weapons of mass destruction. From\r\nthis rostrum, and in this context, the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic calls upon Israel to accede to the NPT and to\r\nplace its nuclear installations under the inspection of the\r\nAtomic Energy Agency so that the States of the region\r\nmay be able to agree to extending the Treaty. This, if it\r\nis done, will be an important step towards the creation of\r\na climate of confidence which in turn will contribute to\r\nbuilding peace and security in the Middle East.\r\nThree years have passed since the convening of the\r\nMadrid Conference and no just and comprehensive peace\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nin the Middle East has materialized. This is a fact that\r\ncannot be cancelled out by the achievement of some\r\nprogress on some tracks.\r\nOur region is the cradle of human civilization and\r\nmonotheistic religions. Succeeding generations of its\r\npeoples have become accustomed to repel invaders. It is\r\ntime for the region to enjoy peace and stability. This\r\ncannot be achieved through half-measure solutions or\r\nthrough the trickle down of droplets of peace, nor can it be\r\nachieved through agreements which encroach on the\r\nnational dignity or compromise the interests of a nation.\r\nSyria accepted the initiative of the United States in\r\nwhich the United States undertook to work towards the\r\nachievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the\r\nregion, on the basis of international legality, Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978)\r\nand the land-for-peace formula including a political solution\r\nto the question of the national rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople. The United States also confirmed that in pursuance\r\nof its previous positions rejecting the extension of Israeli\r\nlaw to the Syrian Golan Heights, it did not agree to the\r\nannexation of any part of the territories occupied in 1967.\r\nIn the light of the complexities of the Arab-Israeli\r\nconflict and the suspicions of the Arab parties regarding\r\nIsrael’s intentions, Syria took two important decisions\r\nwhich complemented one another.\r\nThe first decision was our commitment to coordinate\r\nwith the Arab parties participating in the peace process.\r\nThis was prompted by our conviction that the other Arab\r\nparties would benefit from such solidarity as well as from\r\nthe position of Syria and its various potentialities. We are\r\nalso convinced that the comprehensiveness of the solution\r\nwould be a guarantee to all parties should they respond to\r\nthe requirements of peace.\r\nThe second decision was that the peace option was a\r\nstrategic one. By so doing we misled no one: neither our\r\nown people nor any of the others, as to the truth of our\r\nintentions, so that they may act accordingly.\r\nIn this context, we were absolutely convinced that\r\nthese two important decisions were going to be in the\r\ninterest of all parties participating in the peace process.\r\nThese two decisions, we believed, would also facilitate the\r\ntask of the two sponsors, the United States and the Russian\r\nFederation, in achieving full peace in the region in return\r\nfor full withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied in\r\n1967.\r\nRegrettably, the peace process did not continue on\r\nthe right track towards achieving its desired objective.\r\nThere are many reasons for that. However, we see no\r\npoint in elaborating on them now. Nor do we want to\r\ndigress and elaborate on the current position of those\r\nparties which have strayed from Arab coordination.\r\nSuffice it to refer to an essential point that was revealed\r\nin their public statements. The point is that they have\r\nnow begun to question the usefulness of what they have\r\ndone. The fact is they have become unable to contribute\r\nto the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in\r\nthe region.\r\nIn fact, the optimistic trumpetings by Israel about\r\ngreat progress achieved in the peace process is not true,\r\nexcept from Israel’s point of view. The agreements\r\nreached so far have achieved nothing but what Israel\r\nwanted from the land-for-peace formula while the Arab\r\nparty that signed those agreements with Israel still awaits\r\nIsrael’s response to its demands.\r\nThe most important characteristic of Syria’s policy\r\nunder the leadership of President Hafez al-Assad, is the\r\nreconciling of principle and reality. Principles that cannot\r\nsurvive on the ground are bound to decline. On the other\r\nhand, living the reality without adhering to one’s\r\nprinciples leads to decline.\r\nSyria wants peace, and realizes that all parties have\r\na stake in this peace. It realizes also that peace has\r\nobjective requirements, and it is prepared to fulfil those\r\nrequirements that are agreed upon. Syria means what it\r\nsays and adheres to what it means. The land-for-peace\r\nequation must be implemented in both its parts. The\r\nreturn of the entire Golan is not open to compromise,\r\nunjustified delay or a misplaced testing of intentions. On\r\nthis basis, Syria supports a genuine peace - a peace that\r\nlives and flourishes without artificial obstacles or arbitrary\r\nconditions. Putting on the peace process a greater burden\r\nthan it can bear does not help to achieve peace; rather, it\r\nposes a threat to the process. The peace process should\r\nnot be weighed down with issues that fall outside its\r\nframework.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nIt is regrettable that, as a result of its strong influence\r\non the media, Israel has managed to distort information and\r\nturn facts on their head, to the extent that those in some\r\ncircles of Western public opinion now claim that Syria used\r\nthe Golan Heights to launch offensives against the Israelis,\r\nwhereas, in fact, the opposite was the case. Israel uses the\r\npretext of security in an attempt to justify its occupation of\r\nthe Golan Heights and its refusal to withdraw therefrom.\r\nIt was Israel, not Syria, that started the armed clashes in the\r\nperiod between 1949 and 1967.\r\nUnited Nations records and resolutions on this matter\r\nadopted by the Security Council during that period will\r\ndemonstrate beyond the shadow of a doubt that Israel was\r\nresponsible for opening fire for the purpose of expelling\r\nSyrian farmers from their land and preventing them from\r\nreaping their harvest. It was natural that the Syrian side\r\nshould have defended its own citizens and land by\r\nresponding every time they were fired upon.\r\nThe records to which I have referred are supported by\r\nmemoirs published by senior United Nations officers who\r\nwere entrusted with the task of supervising the truce\r\nbetween Syria and Israel during that period. Among those\r\nofficers are General Odd Bull and General Karl van Horn.\r\nHills and mountains are no obstacle to today’s sophisticated\r\nweapons. In any case, the Golan Heights are directly\r\nopposite the Galilee Mountains, which are within Israel and\r\nare higher than the Golan Heights.\r\nAnyway, whether or not the Israeli public are aware\r\nof the truth of what I have just said, the United Nations\r\nCharter states the basic principle of the non-acquisition of\r\nterritory by force. This principle has been confirmed in\r\nmany Security Council resolutions. The current peace\r\nprocess cannot be completed without Israel’s withdrawing\r\nfrom the entire Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon.\r\nWe believe that our position is just. We have a right\r\nthat we shall never relinquish. As President Assad has\r\nsaid,\r\n\"Relinquishing any part of a nation’s territory\r\namounts to relinquishing the entire country and its\r\npeople’s free will.\"\r\nWe want a just peace that restores everyone’s legitimate\r\nright - the comprehensive peace after which the peoples of\r\nthe region aspire and under which they will be able to\r\nenjoy security, stability and prosperity.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic\r\nof Korea, His Excellency Mr. Han Sung-Joo.\r\nMr. Sung-Joo (Republic of Korea): May I\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. I am convinced that your vast experience and\r\nyour leadership will contribute greatly to the success of\r\nthe session. At the same time, I wish to acknowledge the\r\nexcellent work of your predecessor, Ambassador Samuel\r\nR. Insanally of Guyana, during the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI should like also to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\ndedication to the cause of the United Nations.\r\nThe evolution of the world scene since the last\r\nsession confirms that we live in an age of historic\r\ntransition. The encouraging developments in South Africa\r\nand in the Middle East confirm that conventional\r\nparadigms of the international system are changing.\r\nNations have become so interdependent that force can no\r\nlonger act as the final arbiter. In relations between\r\nnations, rules, agreements and civilized norms have come\r\ninto play as much as traditional regulators.\r\nUntil the modern era we lived in what might be\r\ncalled a Hobbesian world, where conflict, rather than\r\ncooperation, was the defining characteristic of relations\r\nbetween nations. Basically, international relations were\r\nregulated through the mechanism of the balance of power.\r\nSometimes we had the hegemony of one Power, and\r\nsometimes several Powers acting in concert, but these\r\nwere only variations of what was essentially a struggle for\r\npower, a struggle for domination.\r\nThen, in the early part of this century, came the\r\nWilsonian vision, which called for a global organization.\r\nTo this vision we owe the United Nations. After the\r\nSecond World War - even at the height of the cold war -\r\nmankind envisaged a bolder world. The vision of a\r\nglobal welfare was presented, for example, by the\r\nSwedish scholar Gunnar Myrdal, who urged us to move\r\n\"beyond the welfare state\".\r\nNow, at the end of the twentieth century, the demise\r\nof the cold war offers us yet another vision of a new\r\nworld. The old order based on force is losing its grip on\r\ninternational relations. Gone are the days when defects in\r\nthe balance of power necessarily invited ambition or\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nadventure. The days of expansive and proselytizing\r\nideologies have passed. A new order based on peaceful\r\naccord, cooperation and interdependence is emerging.\r\nMr. Touré (Guinea-Bissau), Vice-President took the\r\nChair.\r\nThis can best be characterized as a non-zero-sum\r\nglobal society. In today’s world no country can remain\r\nunaffected by the havoc of another, whether caused by\r\nhunger, tyranny, environmental pollution or the proliferation\r\nof weapons. Similarly, every country can benefit from\r\nworld prosperity, world peace and a cleaner world\r\nenvironment. This new world, if successful in addressing\r\nthorny issues such as the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, will allow us to escape from the age-old\r\nsecurity dilemma.\r\nWhat can we do to solve such critical impending\r\nproblems as poverty, pollution, population, national\r\nconflicts, oppression and the arms race? Most of all, we\r\nneed shared values and common purposes. We first need\r\na sound understanding of the nature of these new problems.\r\nWe must recognize that these are problems that affect us all\r\nand require our concerted efforts.\r\nIn this new era genuine world peace cannot be\r\nachieved without our properly addressing the issues of\r\nsocial and economic development.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on an agenda for development as a timely and\r\nappropriate initiative. His report has moved the United\r\nNations to the foreground of discussions on development.\r\nGiven the importance of the political will of nations in\r\nthis endeavour, the United Nations system as a whole\r\nshould play a leading role by serving as a forum for nations\r\nto work out remedies for economic and social problems\r\nwhich undermine peace and security in many parts of the\r\nworld. We hope that the current General Assembly session\r\nwill provide a much needed opportunity for more serious\r\ndiscussion on these vital issues. Taking advantage of its\r\nrecent experience in development, the Republic of Korea\r\nwill make its full contribution to the effort for global\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nIn June this year a variety of issues on development\r\nwere discussed at the World Hearings on Development. At\r\nthese Hearings special emphasis was placed on human-\r\ncentred development, the interrelationship between peace\r\nand development and the need for strengthening\r\ninternational cooperation. I hope that a concrete action\r\nprogramme will be worked out, based on the informative\r\nviews presented at the Hearings and at the high-level\r\nsegment of the 1994 substantive session of the Economic\r\nand Social Council.\r\nOur past experience has taught us that social\r\ndevelopment and economic growth are inseparable.\r\nMeaningful social progress necessarily includes\r\nsubstantial economic growth. At the same time, the\r\nsubstance of social development - the promotion of social\r\nwelfare, equitable redistribution and the protection of the\r\nenvironment - is crucial for sustainable economic growth.\r\nIn this context, I am convinced that the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, to be held in Copenhagen next\r\nyear, will set a new landmark in the field of social\r\ndevelopment by producing effective and feasible action\r\nplans.\r\nEconomic and social development is closely linked\r\nwith environmental issues. During the past four decades\r\nthe world population has doubled, while the global\r\neconomy has grown eightfold. For the first time the\r\nEarth has begun to feel the heavy strains of human\r\nactivity. It has become evident that the planet can no\r\nlonger keep up with the pace of its exploitation. A\r\nbalance must be struck, and harmony sought, between the\r\nenvironment and development.\r\nTwo years ago the United Nations took a most\r\nimportant initiative by holding the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development. We\r\nshould uphold the goal set by this conference:\r\nenvironmentally sound and sustainable development. To\r\nachieve this goal, the advanced countries should play a\r\nleading role in protecting the environment. Support\r\nshould be given to developing countries in the form of\r\nfinancial contributions and the transfer of\r\nenvironmentally-sound technology. Developing countries,\r\nfor their part, should make efforts commensurate with\r\ntheir capabilities.\r\nAs a member of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, the Republic of Korea has actively\r\nparticipated in formulating global regimes for the\r\nenvironment. We have joined international environmental\r\nagreements and contributed to the Global Environment\r\nFacility (GEF). My Government will continue its efforts\r\nand cooperation to attain both development and a better\r\nenvironment.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nToday we are witnessing a massive exodus of people\r\nin many parts of the world, the consequence of armed\r\nconflict and natural disasters.\r\nWe are pleased that the United Nations capacity to\r\nprovide humanitarian assistance has been strengthened\r\nthrough close coordination between its relevant bodies.\r\nHowever, appeals for urgently needed resources are usually\r\nmet with a fraction of the targeted figures, thereby seriously\r\nhampering the effective implementation of humanitarian\r\nprogrammes. Once again, we need generous assistance\r\nfrom the entire international community.\r\nI am happy to report that, thanks to the recent public\r\ncampaigns organized by the Government and various non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in Korea, the Korean public has\r\nbeen alerted to the importance of humanitarian assistance.\r\nThis is demonstrated by the fact that we have been sending\r\nfinancial aid, medical personnel and supplies to such\r\ntroubled spots as Rwanda.\r\nOn human rights, more than a year has elapsed since\r\nthe Vienna World Conference on this important subject was\r\nheld in 1993. My Government is encouraged to see that\r\nsome of the provisions in its Programme of Action have\r\nalready been implemented.\r\nSince last year the Korean Government has been\r\npursuing in earnest a policy that we call \"new diplomacy\",\r\nwhich emphasizes the universal values of human rights,\r\nwelfare, liberty and democracy. Currently we are preparing\r\nto become a party to the Convention against Torture, and\r\nlast July the Third United Nations Workshop for the\r\nAsia-Pacific Region on Human Rights Issues was held in\r\nSeoul. Among the outcomes of the Workshop was\r\nacceptance of our proposal to hold the Workshop on a\r\nregular basis. That agreement is an expression of the\r\ncollective will of all the Asia-Pacific countries, which has\r\nhelped us to move one step closer to the ultimate\r\nestablishment of a regional human rights institution.\r\nAnother critical task for global peace and security is\r\npreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nboth nuclear and biochemical. Most urgently, we must deal\r\nwith the problem of nuclear proliferation. The Republic of\r\nKorea supports the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) at the Review\r\nand Extension Conference in 1995. The Treaty has made\r\nan enormous contribution to international security as the\r\nmainstay of the non-proliferation regime. The legitimacy\r\nof the NPT should be reinforced through renewed efforts on\r\nthe part of the nuclear Powers and through increased\r\ninternational cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear\r\nenergy. At the same time, the effectiveness of the NPT\r\nregime should be enhanced by strengthening the\r\nsafeguards system of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA).\r\nThe negotiations for a comprehensive test-ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) at the Conference on Disarmament are also very\r\nimportant. A universal and verifiable CTBT will\r\nundoubtedly serve as a major instrument in strengthening\r\nthe non-proliferation regime and advancing nuclear\r\ndisarmament. The recent changes in the world order\r\nrequire a rationalization of disarmament agendas and new\r\nworking methods. The multilateral disarmament\r\nframeworks must meet these requirements. In view of the\r\never-increasing importance of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament as a negotiating forum, its membership\r\nshould be expanded.\r\nIn keeping with the spirit of the United Nations\r\nCharter, efforts for disarmament and security measures\r\nshould also be encouraged on the regional level. In this\r\nregard, the Republic of Korea welcomes the productive\r\ndiscussions on confidence-building measures at the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\nRegional Forum last July in Bangkok. A security\r\ndialogue for the North-East Asian subregion would\r\ncomplement this region-wide framework.\r\nA major challenge to the NPT regime is the North\r\nKorean nuclear problem, which poses a serious threat not\r\nonly to the Korean peninsula, but also to the Asian--\r\nPacific region and the world as a whole. The suspicions\r\nsurrounding the North Korean nuclear programme should\r\nbe completely cleared by securing transparency of its\r\nnuclear activities, past and future, as well as the present.\r\nFor this, North Korea should fully cooperate with the\r\nIAEA in the implementation of the safeguards agreement\r\nand implement the Joint Declaration on the\r\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\r\nIf North Korea fulfils its obligations in good faith,\r\nwe will do all we can to assist the DPRK in the peaceful\r\nuse of nuclear energy. Depending on the resolution of\r\nthe nuclear issue, the Republic of Korea stands ready to\r\nmake its technological and capital resources available for\r\nNorth Korea’s overall economic development in the spirit\r\nof mutual prosperity.\r\nThe post-cold-war international situation presents us\r\nwith opportunities for a new world as well as multiple\r\nchallenges to our efforts for peace and development.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nTherefore, it is all the more imperative that the role of the\r\nUnited Nations be increased.\r\nOne of the most remarkable changes in the aftermath\r\nof the cold war is the strengthened role of the United\r\nNations in peace-keeping. As regional conflicts have come\r\nto replace the bipolar confrontation of the cold war, United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations have expanded\r\ndramatically, both in number and mandate.\r\nGiven the limited resources for United Nations\r\npeace-keeping activities, more effort should be made for the\r\neffective use of preventive diplomacy. The decisions on\r\nUnited Nations involvement in actual conflicts should be\r\nmade selectively and with proper priorities. Continued\r\nefforts should also be made to address the modality of\r\nintervention and the means of securing the necessary\r\nresources.\r\nThe Republic of Korea remains firmly committed to\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping activities. As part of its\r\nongoing support, the Republic of Korea sent an engineering\r\nunit to Somalia last year. Last month we dispatched a\r\nmedical unit to Western Sahara, and in a few days Korean\r\nmilitary observers will arrive in Georgia. Korea also plans\r\nto join United Nations efforts to arrange stand-by forces.\r\nThe new diplomacy of my Government puts emphasis\r\non globalism. Through active engagement in global affairs,\r\nKorea seeks to play its due role within the United Nations\r\nframework. It is in this vein that the Republic of Korea has\r\npresented its candidature for a seat on the Security Council\r\nfor the 1996-1997 term. We look forward to the\r\nencouragement and support of other Member States for this\r\neffort.\r\nWe support reform of the United Nations. Reforms\r\nare needed in order better to cope with the new challenges\r\nfaced by the world body. As United Nations membership\r\nhas increased from 51 in 1945 to 184 in 1994, an\r\nenlargement of the Council seems in order. The key\r\nquestion is how to increase the number of seats without\r\ncompromising the Security Council’s effectiveness.\r\nCreation of a third category of Council members, coupled\r\nwith the expansion of non-permanent membership, may be\r\nan answer.\r\nFor the United Nations fully to assume its role in the\r\nnew international environment, its financial difficulties\r\nshould be duly addressed. It is also imperative that the\r\nefficiency of the Organization and its management be\r\nenhanced to guarantee the effective use of available\r\nresources. In this regard, my delegation welcomes the\r\nestablishment of the Office of Internal Oversight Services,\r\nand looks forward to the active role of the\r\nnewly-appointed Under-Secretary-General for Internal\r\nOversight Services.\r\nThe Republic of Korea feels a particular sense of\r\naffinity with the United Nations. Both Korea and the\r\nUnited Nations were born in the wake of the Second\r\nWorld War. Upon creation, both entertained great\r\nexpectations: the United Nations hoped for global peace;\r\nKorea hoped for national integrity and prosperity. They\r\nboth experienced disappointment, however, as their\r\nexpectations were crushed by conflict and division: the\r\ncold war and East-West division for the United Nations;\r\nthe Korean War and South-North division for Korea.\r\nNow, at last, the United Nations has risen from its\r\nunhappy past with new hopes; the world body is no\r\nlonger held hostage to the paralysing cold war vetoes.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has also overcome socio-political\r\ndifficulties and economic underdevelopment. But the\r\ndivision on the Korean peninsula still remains. It is the\r\nardent wish, and also a firm belief, of the Korean people\r\nthat the shackles of national division will soon be broken\r\nas the South and the North work together in the spirit of\r\nreconciliation and cooperation.\r\nMy country’s unique relationship with the United\r\nNations makes the upcoming fiftieth anniversary all the\r\nmore meaningful to us. The National Committee of the\r\nRepublic of Korea for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations was established last April. This\r\nCommittee is preparing a number of programmes, with\r\nspecial emphasis on enhancing the awareness of the role\r\nof the United Nations among the new generation. We\r\nalso plan to actively participate in the programmes\r\nsponsored by the United Nations. In this regard, I am\r\npleased to note that a leading Korean corporation is\r\nparticipating as a global sponsor in the preparation for the\r\nUnited Nations fiftieth anniversary.\r\nNext year the United Nations will celebrate its\r\ngolden anniversary. It will be an occasion for us all to be\r\nreminded once again of the goals set forth in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations. The new world which was\r\nenvisaged by the founding fathers of this body is yet to\r\ntake shape. But we must be aware that we now stand at\r\na critical juncture in history, and that a rare opportunity\r\nhas been handed to us.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 October 1994\r\nWe have to reach for a peaceful and prosperous world\r\nbased on interdependence and cooperation between nations.\r\nSuccess will depend on our ability to understand the nature\r\nof the new global environment, which is fundamentally\r\ndifferent from the old one, and on our determination to\r\nmeet the challenge.\r\nWe have to associate ourselves with the forces that\r\nwill shape the future. United, and only by being united,\r\ncan we build and thrive in this new world society.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.\r\n24\r\n"
