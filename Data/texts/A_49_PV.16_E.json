(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ali Hassan Mwinyi, President of the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania.\r\nMr. Ali Hassan Mwinyi, President of the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On behalf\r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations the President of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania, His Excellency the Honourable Ali Hassan\r\nMwinyi, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mwinyi: I wish to join my fellow Heads\r\nof State who have spoken before me in congratulating you\r\nmost sincerely on your well-deserved election as President\r\nof the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. As a\r\ndistinguished son of Africa, you bring to this high office\r\nvaluable experience, diplomatic skill and wisdom, all of\r\nwhich equip you superbly well to lead this Assembly - an\r\nassembly in which the faith and hopes of our people are\r\nreposed. Let me assure you, Mr. President, of Tanzania’s\r\nwhole-hearted cooperation and support as you execute your\r\nnoble and immense responsibilities to humanity.\r\nI should also express the great appreciation which\r\nmy delegation feels for the dedication to duty and great\r\nleadership displayed by your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Samuel Insanally of the Republic of Guyana, who\r\nvery ably led the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly to its successful conclusion.\r\nI wish also to acknowledge the untiring efforts of\r\nanother son of Africa, our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, who, together with his Secretariat, has\r\ncontinued to serve our Organization very well indeed.\r\nThe Secretariat needs, and deserves, the support of all\r\nMember States in facing the challenges of their\r\nday-to-day work, often under very trying circumstances.\r\nThis is my second appearance before a session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly since being elected President of the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania in 1985. I had the honour\r\nto address the forty-second session of the Assembly on 8\r\nOctober 1987. I used that occasion, as the new President\r\nof my country, to reaffirm our faith in the United Nations\r\nand our commitment to the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nToday, I am addressing this Assembly for the last\r\ntime as President of my country. As members may well\r\nknow, Tanzania has embarked on extensive political and\r\neconomic reforms, which are proceeding very well, in\r\npeace and in harmony.\r\nAs part of the political reforms, the constitutional\r\nterm of a president is limited to a maximum of two five-\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nyear terms. My second and last term, therefore, will come\r\nto an end towards the end of next year, a time when we\r\nwill hold our first general elections under a multiparty\r\ndemocratic system. It is my great wish that I should\r\nbequeath to the Tanzanian people a functioning democratic\r\nsystem that will allow them to choose their own leaders in\r\na free and fair atmosphere.\r\nAs I prepare to pass on the baton of the leadership of\r\nmy country to someone else, I can only reaffirm the faith\r\nand confidence my country has always had in the United\r\nNations system. All its imperfections notwithstanding, the\r\nUnited Nations remains the only hope for poor and weak\r\ncountries like mine, for it is only through the United\r\nNations that we can raise our concerns for human\r\ndevelopment, world peace, justice and equality without fear.\r\nThe imperfections of the United Nations system have\r\nnothing to do with the principles set forth in the United\r\nNations Charter; rather, they are a product of the action or\r\ninaction of the Member States.\r\nIn this connection we are pleased to extend to all the\r\nnew Members a warm welcome and sincere congratulations.\r\nTheir admission has brought us much closer to our\r\ncherished goal of universal membership of the United\r\nNations. We pledge to continue working closely with all\r\nnations to make our world a much better place for all\r\nhumanity.\r\nDuring my time as President of Tanzania, fundamental\r\nchanges have occurred in the world. Some of these\r\nchanges have given us reasons for hope; others have not.\r\nOur hopes that the post-cold-war era would bring a new\r\nimpetus in our Organization for peace and development in\r\nall corners of the world have not yet been realized. The so-\r\ncalled peace dividend is not reaching those who need it\r\nmost, that is, the poorest sectors of humanity. It is a pity\r\nthat global tensions have been replaced by regional and\r\nnational conflicts, with devastating consequences for\r\ninnocent men, women and children. Whether on\r\ndevelopment questions or security issues, the developing\r\ncountries, which constitute the vast majority, have seen\r\nlittle respite following the end of the cold war.\r\nThe collective security system envisaged under the\r\nUnited Nations Charter has not always worked to the\r\nsatisfaction of many Members. This is because some\r\nMember States have, in the past, been reluctant to\r\nimplement both the letter and the spirit of the Charter.\r\nInstead, loopholes and pretexts have often been used to\r\njustify action contrary to the spirit of the Charter. Today,\r\nas we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, we all need to rededicate ourselves to the goals\r\nand ideals embodied in its Charter. This includes the\r\nneed to make the United Nations and all its organs more\r\nrepresentative of all its Members and more democratic.\r\nIt is both hypocritical and a mockery of the ideal of\r\ndemocracy that some Members should preach democracy\r\nto the rest of the world and yet not accept the full\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations system.\r\nThis matter is particularly urgent in this post-\r\ncold-war world era. The emerging new power relations\r\nin the world can be either an asset or a liability,\r\ndepending on whether all Members have the political will\r\nto enhance the representative nature and the democratic\r\ntraditions of this world body. If such political will exists,\r\nI am sure we can make rapid progress on the expressed\r\ndesire of many Member States to look again at the role,\r\npowers and membership of the Security Council. I am\r\nequally sure that if we all have the political will to reform\r\nthe United Nations system for the better, we can quickly\r\nagree on enhancing the powers of the General Assembly\r\nand the Economic and Social Council. It is these two\r\norgans that are important agents in focusing our\r\nOrganization on the real and urgent issues confronting the\r\noverwhelming majority of humanity.\r\nIn his comprehensive report to the General Assembly\r\nat its forty-eighth session, the Secretary-General drew our\r\nattention to the peace-keeping role of the United Nations\r\nin the changing international context. While United\r\nNations peace-keeping and peacemaking responsibilities\r\nhave been on the increase, the means to implement those\r\nresponsibilities have hardly kept pace with these new\r\nrequirements. With more than 80,000 civilian and\r\nmilitary personnel serving in 17 peace-keeping operations\r\nworldwide, the Organization requires new commitment\r\ntowards meeting the costs involved.\r\nWe should all strive to honour our financial\r\nobligations as assessed to meet United Nations\r\npeace-keeping expenses. We must not reach the point\r\nwhere training and deployment of personnel will be\r\nundertaken only by those Member States who can afford\r\nsuch expenses on their own. Such an eventuality will not\r\nonly make peace-keeping the monopoly of a few rich\r\ncountries but will also deal a fatal blow to our cherished\r\nprinciple of universality of participation. In this\r\nconnection, we entirely support the proposal made by\r\nCanada last week in this Assembly for the establishment\r\nof a permanent United Nations peace-keeping force. This\r\nidea has been with us for a long time, and now is the\r\ntime to act.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to salute all\r\nUnited Nations personnel in the field for their devotion to\r\nduty and their perseverance under increasingly dangerous\r\nsituations. Many, including Tanzanians, have died in\r\naction. We mourn them. Many more have been wounded.\r\nThey deserve our heartfelt sympathy. The safety and\r\nsecurity of United Nations personnel must continue to be a\r\npriority, and we support every initiative taken to establish\r\nan international treaty for their protection.\r\nAs a neighbour of both Rwanda and Burundi,\r\nTanzania has found itself deeply involved in the search for\r\npeace and reconciliation in those two most troubled\r\ncountries. Last year in Cairo, we, the African Heads of\r\nState, decided that the time had come for Africans to take\r\ncharge of preventing, managing and resolving conflicts in\r\ntheir continent, for our countries may be poor, but our\r\npoverty does not extend to the realm of humanity, dignity\r\nand wisdom.\r\nIn both Rwanda and Burundi, there was a time when\r\nour hopes rose high, when we thought that at last a\r\npermanent solution had been found to their endemic\r\nproblems. In the case of Burundi, the high point was the\r\nelection of July 1993, which was declared by international\r\nobservers to have been free and fair. The transition of\r\npower from President Buyoya to the late President Ndadaye\r\nwas equally impressive. That man, whom the people of\r\nBurundi had chosen to lead them, personified not only hope\r\nfor peace, unity and reconciliation in Burundi, but also the\r\ndawn of a new era of peace, stability and cooperation in\r\nour subregion.\r\nBut some people in the military establishment decided\r\nto put their private and parochial interests above the wishes\r\nof the ordinary people of Burundi. What the Burundi\r\npeople got through the ballot was taken away by the bullet.\r\nThe attempted coup that followed in October 1993 resulted\r\nnot only in the death of President Ndadaye but also in the\r\ndeath of many innocent people of Burundi. No one knows\r\nexactly how many died; estimates range from 100,000 to\r\n200,000. But statistics alone are unimportant, as not a\r\nsingle life should have been lost in the first place; above\r\nall, behind these cold statistics are real people - husbands\r\nand wives, sons and daughters, all of whom perished\r\nleaving behind widows and widowers, as well as orphans.\r\nIn addition to those who died, over 700,000 others fled\r\ntheir country in order to save their lives; about 500,000 of\r\nthem fled to Tanzania alone. Another 200,000 or more\r\nwere displaced internally. With those events of October\r\n1993, our hopes for peace and reconciliation in Burundi\r\nwere dashed to the ground; since then we have been\r\nwaiting anxiously for new developments that could\r\nrekindle our hopes.\r\nWe are encouraged by the efforts of moderate\r\nelements in Burundi to create a transitional government of\r\nunity, based on the concept of power sharing. It is\r\nincumbent upon those of us neighbouring Burundi and\r\nupon the international community as a whole to support\r\nand encourage the Government of President Sylvestre\r\nNtibantunganya during this transitional period.\r\nIn the case of Rwanda, the event that gave us hope\r\nwas the signing of the Arusha Peace Agreement on 4\r\nAugust 1993. The Agreement provided a comprehensive\r\nframework for the permanent solution of the political and\r\nsecurity problems in Rwanda. But the Agreement, which\r\nhad been so painstakingly negotiated, was held hostage by\r\nthose who were keen to protect their own interests rather\r\nthan the interests of the ordinary citizens of Rwanda. For\r\neight months, the timetable agreed upon for the\r\nimplementation of the Arusha Agreement was not\r\nfollowed. The only transitional institution provided for in\r\nthe Agreement was the presidency. The death of\r\nPresident Habyarimana, therefore, denied us the only legal\r\ntransitional authority in Rwanda at that time. Then began\r\nthe worst carnage in African history - which, even as I\r\nspeak, is still claiming the lives of innocent people, not to\r\nmention having been the cause of over 1.5 million\r\nrefugees in neighbouring countries. Most of those who\r\nparticipated in the Arusha negotiations on behalf of the\r\nthen Rwanda Government were massacred.\r\nFollowing its military victory, the Rwandese\r\nPatriotic Front (RPF) established in July 1994 a fairly\r\nbroad-based Government of National Unity. Tanzania\r\nwas among the first countries to recognize this new\r\nGovernment. We recognize and appreciate the efforts and\r\ngood intentions of this new Government to restore peace\r\nin Rwanda, to rebuild State institutions and to bring about\r\ngenuine national reconciliation. In particular, we\r\nencourage and support all efforts of the Rwandese\r\nGovernment to create conditions within Rwanda that will\r\ngive Rwandese refugees the confidence to return home as\r\nsoon as possible. Rwanda needs to revert to a state of\r\nnormalcy as soon as possible. A country from which its\r\nown citizens run away to save their lives cannot be\r\nnormal. Even as I speak, some Rwandese refugees\r\ncontinue to enter Tanzania. This means that the\r\nRwandese people, especially the Hutus, still feel\r\ninsecure - whether for valid reasons or as a result of the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\npropaganda war waged by the ousted regime and its agents.\r\nIn this connection, the Government of Rwanda needs\r\nthe encouragement and practical assistance of the\r\ninternational community to restore essential services and to\r\nre-establish the rule of justice and law and order. The\r\ntraditional discipline within the ranks of the RPF needs to\r\nbe maintained, and individual acts of vengeance must be\r\ncontained. Innocent Hutu refugees must feel secure and\r\nconfident that no reprisals will be meted out to them for\r\nprevious atrocities associated with their tribe. On the other\r\nhand, all those guilty of the genocide in Rwanda must face\r\njustice. In this respect, we urge the United Nations, in\r\ncollaboration with the Rwandese Government, quickly to\r\nmake operational the international tribunal that will\r\ninvestigate and put to trial all those suspected of\r\ncommitting these atrocities. This, we hope, will reduce the\r\nmotivation for individual acts of revenge.\r\nThe urgency of stemming the tide of refugees, and of\r\neffecting their subsequent repatriation, is of paramount\r\nimportance. The refugee camps must not be allowed to\r\nacquire the character of permanency, as this would create\r\nan environment conducive to the political and even military\r\nmobilization of the refugees. In the meanwhile, we who\r\nare hosts to these refugees have a duty to disarm them and\r\ntake whatever action is necessary to make it impossible for\r\nthem to be mobilized, whether for political or military\r\npurposes.\r\nNeighbouring countries and the international\r\ncommunity should also warn the deposed regime and its\r\narmy not to entertain thoughts of a military return to power.\r\nWe cannot allow another chapter of this tragedy to be\r\nwritten in the history of Rwanda. For, as an English\r\npolitical philosopher, Edmund Burke, said two centuries\r\nago:\r\n\"The use of force alone is but temporary. It may\r\nsubdue for a moment; but it does not remove the\r\nnecessity of subduing again; and a nation is not\r\ngoverned, which is perpetually to be conquered.\"\r\nIn this connection, I wish to emphasize the need for\r\nthe Rwandese Government to proceed on the basis of the\r\nframework of the Arusha Peace Accord, which in my view\r\nremains the best hope for a permanent solution to the\r\nproblems facing that country. As Facilitator to the peace\r\nprocess in Rwanda, I wish to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nDr. Salim Ahmed Salim, and the OAU Secretariat for the\r\noutstanding commitment they have shown to the resolution\r\nof this problem, despite the many disappointments along\r\nthe way. I also wish to use this opportunity to thank the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as Belgium, Burundi, France,\r\nGermany, Senegal, Uganda, the United States of America\r\nand Zaire, which acted as observers to the Arusha peace\r\nnegotiations.\r\nI wish also to thank the United Nations agencies and\r\nall Governments and non-governmental organizations that\r\njoined hands with my Government in providing relief to\r\nthe Rwandese refugees in my country. But the relief\r\nwork is far from being over; new refugees are still\r\ncoming in. The local communities which have hosted the\r\nrefugees need to be compensated for the food and other\r\nservices and supplies they have shared with them. The\r\nenvironmental damage caused by the huge and sudden\r\ninflux of refugees also needs to be addressed as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nThe people of Ngara district in Tanzania have\r\nthemselves been forced to live like refugees in their own\r\ncountry. The local population has been outnumbered by\r\nthe refugees by a ratio of one to two. They face\r\novercrowding in social service centres and endure\r\ntremendous price hikes, sometimes reaching 300 per cent\r\nover a short period, for all their requirements. And to\r\nthis must be added increased security risks and\r\ncriminality.\r\nAs for environmental damage, the influx of refugees\r\ninto Ngara and Karagwe in Tanzania, between April and\r\nJune 1994 alone, caused a loss of 18,000 tons of trees,\r\nwith an estimated value of $12 million. The 400,000\r\nrefugees living in Ngara have since April consumed\r\n200 tons of firewood daily, with far-reaching\r\nconsequences for the environment. The international\r\ncommunity needs to continue to be seized of this matter\r\nand increase its support to those of us hosting this huge\r\ninflux of refugees.\r\nIt is only honourable for us as Members of the\r\nUnited Nations to accept that the role of our Organization\r\nin Rwanda has been far from honourable, and has been\r\nquite contrary to the principles of our Charter. While aid\r\nagencies and non-governmental organizations can do\r\nwonders on the ground, Governments wring their hands\r\nand wait for one another to lead the action. The crisis in\r\nRwanda was made worse by political indecision within\r\nthe international community. My delegation can only\r\nagree with the OAU Secretary-General that, by our failure\r\nto act promptly, we too stand to be blamed for the loss of\r\ninnocent lives and the suffering of an entire people.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nAfrican troops pledged at the OAU Summit in Cairo\r\nlast June should quickly be given the necessary logistic\r\nsupport to enable the redeployment of the United Nations\r\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) at its full\r\nstrength to start without undue delay. The enlarged\r\nUNAMIR should then create safe zones along the Zairian\r\nand Tanzanian borders, which should be fully stocked with\r\nrelief supplies so as to encourage refugees to enter these\r\nsafe zones as a first step towards returning to their own\r\nhomes.\r\nSince my country became a member of this\r\nOrganization, there has perhaps been no issue before this\r\nAssembly which has preoccupied us like the question of\r\ndecolonization and the struggle against the apartheid system\r\nin South Africa. It is therefore a matter of tremendous\r\nsatisfaction to us that decolonization is now almost\r\ncomplete and that apartheid has finally landed where it\r\nbelongs - in the dustbin of history. South Africa’s return\r\nto the membership of the United Nations is a victory for all\r\nthe people of that country, whatever their colour, a victory\r\nfor the United Nations and certainly a victory for the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nThe political and economic reintegration of South\r\nAfrica into the rest of Africa is one of the biggest triumphs\r\nfor Africa for many years. We in the southern African sub-\r\nregion are happy that at last our people can sleep peacefully\r\nwithout fearing a surprise attack or a destabilization\r\ncampaign from South Africa. We are happy that the\r\nemerging peace and security in our region can now release\r\nscarce resources for the development of our people. On the\r\neconomic front, we have quickly begun to reverse the years\r\nof disengagement from South Africa and to work together\r\nto integrate our economies through the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC), in which the new South\r\nAfrica will play a very important role.\r\nThis, unfortunately, does not mean that all our\r\nproblems in southern Africa have been resolved. Events in\r\nAngola continue to cause us a good deal of anxiety.\r\nThrough its endless intransigency, UNITA continues to\r\ncreate problems for the Angolan peace talks in Lusaka\r\nunder United Nations mediation. I think the time has come\r\nfor the international community to exert final pressure on\r\nUNITA to stop it from continuing to obstruct these peace\r\nefforts. We must not forget that the MPLA party won the\r\nelections sponsored by the United Nations in September\r\n1992. Yet, regardless of its victory, the MPLA has been\r\ngenerous in inviting UNITA to join a government of\r\nnational unity. We cannot see why certain foreign\r\nGovernments should continue to pamper UNITA as it\r\ncomes up with new excuses to delay the process of\r\nnational reconciliation in that country. Our Organization\r\nshould tell Mr. Savimbi that he cannot have his own way\r\nforever. We therefore call upon all those with influence\r\non Mr. Savimbi to ask him either to cooperate or face the\r\nconsequences of the full sanctions promised in resolution\r\n932 (1994).\r\nIn Mozambique, thanks to the determined efforts of\r\nthe Secretary-General and the United Nations Operation\r\nin Mozambique (ONUMOZ), most of the difficulties have\r\nsince been overcome. We look forward with anticipation\r\nto the national elections later this month in the hope that\r\nthey will not only be free and fair, but also that all parties\r\nwill respect and abide by the election results. We hope\r\nthat the lessons from the Angolan experience have now\r\nbeen learned well and that the people of Mozambique will\r\nbe spared the menace that Mr. Savimbi continues to\r\npresent in Angola. We commend, in particular, the\r\noutstanding goodwill and generosity of the Government\r\nof President Chissano, which was demonstrated\r\nthroughout the negotiating process.\r\nDespite overall economic growth in the world, and\r\nthe creation of numerous developmental and social\r\ninstitutions, poverty has been on the increase in most\r\nparts of the developing world, particularly in Africa.\r\nA supportive international environment is crucial if\r\nwe are to attain sustained economic growth in developing\r\ncountries, especially in the least developed ones. The\r\nUnited Nations must be able to play a much greater role\r\nin this matter because, unlike the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, the United Nations is universal; its\r\nprogrammes operate everywhere; and it does not ignore\r\ncountries. But I must add that the United Nations has to\r\nbe strengthened, as mandated by its Charter, to enable it\r\nto play a complementary role vis-à-vis the other\r\ninternational organizations involved in development.\r\nMost of the least developed countries, including\r\nTanzania, remain among the most debt-distressed\r\ncountries. It is true that the magnitude of our debt is\r\nmarginal by international standards. Indeed, the\r\nindebtedness of the least developed countries does not\r\nhave a substantial effect on the international financial\r\nsystem. But in relation to the size of their economies, the\r\ndebt burden is far too heavy and constitutes a major\r\nobstacle to sustained growth. In the light of an already\r\ngrim financial flow situation, caused by declines in\r\nofficial development assistance, the crippling burden of\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\ninternational debt has seriously hampered development\r\nprospects for most of our countries.\r\nAs an illustration, if we in Tanzania were to apportion\r\nour total national debt of $6.3 billion to each of our\r\ncitizens, every poor man, woman and child would be\r\nindebted to our rich creditors by the equivalent of their total\r\nearnings for over two years. Put differently, even if the\r\nTanzanian Government were to devote all its foreign\r\nexchange earnings to paying off this debt, it would still take\r\nus over 12 years to do so. With a debt burden of this\r\nmagnitude dragging us down all the time, it will be difficult\r\nfor our economy to take off.\r\nThere is an urgent need for the international\r\ncommunity to adopt a unified and coordinated approach\r\ntowards a durable solution of the external debt position of\r\ncountries like mine if we are serious about reducing poverty\r\nin the world. To achieve this, there should be a full\r\ncancellation of all bilateral and official debt, as well as a\r\nsubstantial reduction of the debt stock and the debt service\r\nburden owed to multilateral financial institutions and\r\ncommercial creditors.\r\nNowhere in the world today are the social conditions\r\nmore desperate and calling for more urgent attention than\r\nin the least developed countries. Declining income\r\naggravates poverty and threatens the social fabric of entire\r\nsocieties.\r\nIt is our hope that the forthcoming World Summit for\r\nSocial Development in Copenhagen will be an important\r\nforum for the world community to focus on the social and\r\ndevelopmental concerns of developing countries in an\r\nattempt to free them from the vicious circle of poverty.\r\nThe protracted Uruguay Round of the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) finally came to a\r\nconclusion in December 1993. We then met at Marrakesh,\r\nMorocco, on 15 April 1994, to sign the new agreement that\r\nestablishes the World Trade Organization. We from the\r\ndeveloping world, and especially those of us from\r\nSub-Saharan Africa, signed that agreement not because we\r\nwere happy with it or because we thought it took care of\r\nour interests. We signed it because the alternative was\r\nequally tragic. In truth, this new agreement will only mean\r\nthe entrenchment of poverty in our countries unless\r\ncompensatory measures are urgently taken in our favour.\r\nIt is already being estimated that Africa is the only\r\ncontinent that will actually lose rather than gain from this\r\nnew agreement. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to lose\r\nabout $2.6 billion a year by the beginning of the next\r\ncentury. The cause of this loss is largely the\r\nentrenchment of unfavourable terms of trade, and the\r\nopening up of African markets to transnational\r\ncorporations based in the rich countries, which will now\r\nhave wider and unhindered access to markets in Africa\r\nand elsewhere. We will therefore continue to demand\r\nbetter terms of trade for our products in international\r\ntrade, as well as preferential treatment where this is felt\r\nto be necessary.\r\nIt is now two years since we assembled at Rio de\r\nJaneiro to bring to its conclusion the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development. The\r\nimplementation of the agreements reached at that world\r\nsummit has been extremely slow and in most areas\r\nnon-existent. The world is still far from the concept of\r\nsustainable development. The Agenda 21 document\r\nremains an academic masterpiece while the issues\r\ninvolved remain unresolved. Among other things, the\r\nUnited Nations, through the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, should assume a major role in helping\r\ndeveloping countries to build their indigenous capacities\r\nin science and technology and in promoting access to\r\nexisting technology on favourable terms.\r\nWe are none the less gratified that the desertification\r\nConvention has been concluded. This is a great relief for\r\nthe 900 million people world wide affected by this\r\nphenomenon. We look forward to the signing of the\r\nConvention later this month.\r\nWe commend our development partners that\r\nsupported the negotiations on this important Convention\r\nfor Africa. The African annex to the Convention contains\r\nour commitments to implement the programmes of action\r\nin an effort to contain the processes of desertification and\r\ndrought, which are exacerbated by poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. Unless there is a serious commitment\r\nby developed countries and multilateral financial\r\ninstitutions to extend the financial resources required to\r\nimplement the Convention, the social and economic\r\nconsequences of desertification and drought will be\r\nirreparable.\r\nWe welcome the timely initiative taken by the\r\nSecretary-General in preparing the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment. The Agenda provides an appropriate\r\nframework for dealing comprehensively with the\r\ninterrelated issues of economic and social development,\r\nthe environment, peace, justice and democracy.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nDevelopment is a shared concern of all nations and the\r\nacceptance of this fact by the entire international\r\ncommunity will result in great success in dealing with this\r\nAgenda.\r\nWhile we recognize that States must assume\r\nresponsibility for their own socio-economic development,\r\nwe must also recognize that this will be increasingly\r\ndifficult without the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity. The solutions to the problems created by\r\npoverty, rural-urban migration, the degradation of the\r\nenvironment and the complexity of the refugee situation\r\nwill require an integrated approach. It is our hope that the\r\nAgenda for Development will project a coherent strategy\r\nfor achieving a new and inclusive vision of world\r\ndevelopment. Such a strategy must bind all countries, both\r\nsmall and large, rich and poor, in a planned and\r\nimplementable programme for human progress.\r\nTanzania attaches great importance to the full and\r\neffective participation of developing countries in decision-\r\nmaking for the resolution of economic problems facing our\r\ncommon planet. In addition, the Agenda should incorporate\r\nthe various agreements and strategies for international\r\ndevelopment already adopted over the years in different\r\nforums and conferences. We must also identify the reasons\r\nwhy so many of these commitments and agreements,\r\nespecially those related to developing countries, are still on\r\npaper only.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate our faith in and\r\ncommitment to the United Nations. In this post-cold-war\r\nera, the temptation to bypass, or dictate to, this world body\r\nmight be quite high. We must not allow that to take place.\r\nWe must instead work to strengthen the United Nations and\r\nits agencies and to entrench their democratic tradition. We\r\nmust, at the same time, recognize that poverty, like the\r\nenvironment, knows no borders. It is in our collective\r\ninterest that, as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations system, we dedicate ourselves in practical\r\nterms to the eradication of poverty the world over. We\r\nmust agree that poverty is as much a threat to peace and\r\nsecurity and as much an affront to humanity as injustice,\r\noppression and discrimination.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the United Republic of Tanzania for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ali Hassan Mwinyi, President of the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\nshould like to draw the attention of members of the\r\nAssembly to document A/49/452, containing a letter\r\naddressed to me by the Chairman of the Fifth Committee\r\nconcerning the proposed revisions to the medium-term\r\nplan for the period 1992-1997.\r\nI should like to ask Member States to submit, in\r\nwriting, their views on programme 6 of the medium-term\r\nplan no later than Wednesday, 26 October, for transmittal\r\nto the Fifth Committee as soon as possible.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the Prime\r\nMinister of the Principality of Andorra.\r\nMr. Oscar Ribas Reig, Prime Minister of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I have\r\npleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra, His Excellency Mr. Oscar Ribas\r\nReig, and inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Ribas Reig (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Your election,\r\nSir, to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of the\r\nAssembly marks an important moment for your country,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, and for the entire African continent. I have\r\nthe honour to convey to you the warmest wishes of the\r\npeople and Government of Andorra. I also take this\r\nopportunity to express appreciation of the great\r\naccomplishments of your predecessor, Ambassador\r\nInsanally.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nI am speaking before you here only a few hours\r\nbefore the official opening of the Permanent Mission of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra to the United Nations, the first\r\ndiplomatic Mission of Andorra anywhere in the world.\r\nThis Permanent Mission is the embodiment of the will of\r\nthe Andorran people to participate actively in the\r\nimplementation of the ideals of the United Nations Charter.\r\nOn the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding\r\nof this Organization, our Mission will work towards the\r\nachievement of important goals. For one thing, it will\r\nmake careful preparation for the World Summit on Social\r\nDevelopment to be held in Copenhagen. The objectives of\r\nthat Summit - namely, to find ways to reduce poverty,\r\nenhance employment opportunities and strengthen social\r\nintegration - are particularly important in relation to the\r\nnew possibilities for development under consideration by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his \"Agenda for Development\".\r\nFor another thing, Andorra will take part, with the greatest\r\ninterest, in the work of the Third Committee, whose\r\nactivities support our historic devotion to respect for human\r\nrights. I wish also to take this opportunity to acknowledge\r\nthe commendable work of the new United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, Ambassador Ayala Lasso.\r\nAs president of the United States, John Fitzgerald\r\nKennedy stood before the Berlin Wall and pronounced that\r\nfamous phrase, \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" (\"I am a Berliner\").\r\nAnd for people everywhere in the world who listened to\r\nhim on that historic occasion, the word \"Berliner\" was\r\nunderstood to mean \"a defender of freedom\".\r\nFor those countries whose culture expresses itself in\r\nthe Catalan language, a similar moment has become equally\r\nhistoric. I speak of the day when the distinguished\r\nmusician and universally recognized artist Paul \"Pablo\"\r\nCasals boldly affirmed, here at the General Assembly of the\r\nUnited Nations, before Secretary-General U Thant: \"I am\r\nCatalan\". Everyone understood immediately that, with\r\nthese words, he was beginning a song of liberty and\r\ndeclaring himself to be the son of a people filled with\r\nrespect for others, a people who had created one of the\r\noldest parliamentary and democratic systems in the world,\r\nas he stated in his dedication to the cause of peace. Let us\r\nremember that the hymn of the United Nations, the Hymn\r\nto Peace, is his work, and that it was played for the first\r\ntime, with lyrics by the poet W. H. Auden, on\r\n27 October 1971.\r\nAllow me today to humbly join two such important\r\nand respected figures and proclaim, in the same spirit and\r\nwith the same passion, \"I am an Andorran\". And I hope\r\nthat this expression will have the same meaning for you\r\nas the earlier assertions, and not seem to be a childish and\r\nself-centred show of pride, for throughout the centuries\r\nour ancient and small State has always demonstrated its\r\nlove of freedom, its will to contribute to balance and\r\nharmony, and its concern to maintain peace.\r\nIt has been a little more than a year since Andorra\r\nbecame a Member of the United Nations, following the\r\napproval of our Constitution and the full adaptation of our\r\nmodel of statehood to that befitting a State under modern\r\nlaw. Because of this, and because of the fact that we are\r\nthe last of the four small, historically independent\r\nEuropean States - the others being Liechtenstein, San\r\nMarino and Monaco - to have become Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, it seems that this is an appropriate\r\noccasion on which to reflect on the possible contributions\r\nof micro-States to the family of nations.\r\nIt is evident that in a world in which great\r\noperations must be performed on a grand scale, the\r\nsimple fact of our existence might appear anachronistic or\r\nirrelevant. Indeed, at a time when the establishment of\r\nthe World Trade Organization points towards the end of\r\nprotectionism, and the North American Free Trade\r\nAgreement, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\r\nCouncil, and the European Union herald the creation of\r\nlarge areas in which there is free circulation of goods and\r\nservices, one might well question the need for the\r\ncontinued existence of a number of small States which\r\noften find themselves surrounded, as in our case, by large\r\nsupranational entities such as the European Union.\r\nYet I believe that as we move towards integration,\r\nit becomes more than ever necessary to respect and\r\npreserve the identities of micro-States. It is clear that\r\nthese identities are not measured in terms of size, nor do\r\nthey allow for the subordination of a minority within a\r\nmajority, of a smaller collective identity within another\r\nthat is demographically larger.\r\nAs democracy consists of government by the\r\nmajority and the respect of minorities, on the international\r\nstage the politics of large blocs and of great Powers must\r\nbe compatible with the recognition of groups which,\r\nthough smaller, must not be relegated in any way to a\r\nstatus that is discriminatory nor must they be considered\r\nless than what they are.\r\nIt is evident that all small States - and probably a\r\nquarter of those represented here are small States in one\r\nway or another - have clear limitations. It is evident also\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nthat the contribution of great Powers to the establishment\r\nand the preservation of world order is, and must be,\r\ndecisive. But it is also true that, beyond their limitations,\r\nsmall States have qualities that humanity cannot do without,\r\nespecially at the present time when many peace and\r\nreconciliation processes have not been resolved and remain\r\nin need of great generosity, comprehension, tolerance and\r\na will to compromise.\r\nBy their very nature, micro-States must, in an intrinsic\r\nand essential way, have respect for diversity and mutual\r\nharmony. Precisely because of their small size, they have\r\nlearned in the long course of history that durable solutions\r\ncannot be imposed, and that the core of the differences\r\ncannot be eliminated. More powerful States can gain useful\r\nknowledge from their experience, built upon a wisdom that\r\nonly centuries can provide. This is even more pertinent\r\ntoday, when the great Powers have begun to show a certain\r\nself-restraint, having discovered that while the use of force\r\nmight postpone a conflict, it cannot be the basis for a\r\nlasting solution. May the great Powers of the world be\r\nguided by the rules of conduct that micro-States have been\r\ncompelled to adopt, and may the necessity of the small be\r\nthe virtue of the large. To propose rather than impose, to\r\nnegotiate rather than to compel, to discuss rather than\r\ndictate, to reconcile rather than radicalize, to respect rather\r\nthan humiliate, to cooperate rather than exploit, and to\r\nrefrain rather than abuse: those are the rules of conduct\r\ndear to the small States, characteristics which appear to be\r\nincreasingly necessary in many regions of our planet, if\r\nwhat we want is for the people of the world to live together\r\nin dignity and fight together against hunger, poverty,\r\ndisease and the negative effects of the demographic\r\nexplosion.\r\nIt is for this reason, that I venture to call the attention\r\nof the members of the Assembly to the virtues of the\r\nmicro-States and to ask them to consider whether they\r\nmight not make them their own. It is simply a question of\r\nthe great nations making an imaginative effort to put\r\nthemselves in the place of those who possess neither\r\nmilitary power nor human and economic resources to\r\nimpose on others, and consequently to realize that problems\r\nmay be approached in another way, with probably better\r\nguarantees for a successful outcome.\r\nThis approach finds its origin in the strictest respect\r\nfor the identity of others, of their collective personality and\r\nall the features that contribute to it, as well as their culture;\r\nfor culture is always an element of integration. And it is\r\nprecisely the balance of cultures and their interaction which\r\nis the basis for peaceful coexistence, which is in itself\r\nconsiderable, and even more for a cordial and fraternal\r\nlife together. Let us therefore forget the worries of\r\nassimilation and the belief in the superiority of the\r\nmajority, and let us try to organize life together with\r\nmutual respect, something that becomes increasingly\r\nimportant in a world under great pressure from\r\ndemographic change and immigration.\r\nAllow me to refer to my country, the Principality of\r\nAndorra, which with a population of only 61,000\r\ninhabitants has three different educational systems -\r\nAndorran, French, and Spanish - three quarters of its\r\npopulation being immigrants, and a small territory stuck\r\nlike an island in the middle of the European Union. And\r\nI believe that a study of some of the balances that exist in\r\nAndorra might be useful to efforts in southern Africa, in\r\nthe Middle East, or in other parts of Europe and the\r\nworld where people are struggling to bring about peace.\r\nThink, likewise, of the great worries of our times,\r\nwhere the drug trafficking and organized crime have led\r\nto a dramatic deterioration in urban safety. Members\r\nmight agree with me that the affirmation \"small is\r\nbeautiful\" might appear excessive, but it nevertheless\r\nguarantees a level of security far greater than that which\r\nexists in the enormous urban conurbations of more\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nI should like further to call the Assembly’s attention\r\nto the urgency of the task of protecting the environment,\r\nand the defence of nature. Members might agree with me\r\nthat a smaller territory is much easier to manage,\r\naccording to environmental criteria, and consequently that\r\nthere is less chance of environmental abuse. In the same\r\nway, the scarcity of human resources probably makes us\r\nmore inclined to consider the problems that we shall\r\ndiscuss at the World Summit on Social Development in\r\nCopenhagen, namely, individual problems of marginalized\r\npeople, of those that cannot follow the competitive\r\nmajority in the apparent flow of progress, of the disabled,\r\nthe sick, and, in general, all those in need of solidarity.\r\nI know that in a forum such as this Christian\r\nindividualism is just a partial approach to these questions,\r\nbut I am convinced that, with a translation into other\r\ncultures or religions, on a small scale it is much easier to\r\ngive a personal answer to the problems of the many. And\r\nalso, in general terms, I think that this philosophy is the\r\none that often inspires solidarity movements, as is the\r\ncase today in Rwanda, where, for example, the spirit of\r\ncollective life common to small communities might have\r\nprevented conflict.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nIn a world that is increasingly interdependent, and\r\nincreasingly globalized, I sincerely believe that the\r\nmicro-States, although indeed small, are not superfluous.\r\nAnd we can even make useful contributions and be points\r\nof reference in many cases. Sovereign States are\r\nincreasingly affected by the sovereignty of others and by\r\nnecessary international agreements; but freedom, and the\r\nspirit of solidarity are more important than sovereignties or\r\nborders.\r\nI ask the Assembly therefore to consider the possibility\r\nthat we all make an effort to act like micro-States: we who\r\nare micro-States, and therefore have no alternative, and\r\nthose who are not, because they have come to the\r\nconclusion that this is the way we will all be able, together,\r\nto contribute more positively to peace, progress and\r\ncoexistence. And as from the sum of small streams of\r\nwater the big rivers are born, perhaps from the sum of\r\nsmall identities and from respect for others and minorities,\r\nwe may be able to build together a more equitable, a more\r\nsecure and a more livable world for us, for our children,\r\nand for generations to come.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime\r\nMinister of the Principality of Andorra for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Oscar Ribas Reig, Prime Minister of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, His\r\nExcellency Sardar Aseff Ahmad Ali, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Ali (Pakistan): The Pakistan delegation\r\ncongratulates you warmly, Sir, on your election to preside\r\nover this important forty-ninth session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. Your election is a fitting\r\ntribute to your experience and outstanding achievements.\r\nIt is also an expression of the high regard in which the\r\ninternational community holds your great country. We are\r\nconfident that under your able stewardship this Assembly\r\nwill succeed in advancing the noble aims and objectives of\r\nour Charter.\r\nI wish also to record my delegation’s profound\r\nappreciation for your predecessor, Ambassador Samuel\r\nInsanally of Guyana. He presided most ably over the\r\nAssembly as well as over the important Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council reforms.\r\nThe principal purpose of this world Organization is\r\n\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\".\r\nThe United Nations must ensure that the twilight of the\r\ntwentieth century is not as bloody as was its dawn. We\r\nmust act resolutely to end the series of regional conflicts\r\nthat currently threaten international peace and stability.\r\nThe civil war in Afghanistan has compounded the\r\nsuffering imposed on its people during the long and\r\nvictorious struggle against foreign occupation. The world\r\ncommunity should not forsake the Afghan people. We\r\nmust continue to demand an immediate end to the\r\nhostilities. We must promote a new political consensus\r\nfor the future governance of Afghanistan. To facilitate\r\nthis, we must commence reconstruction in the peaceful\r\nparts of the country.\r\nWe welcome the temporary truce in Tajikistan.\r\nPakistan hopes that the preliminary steps agreed will be\r\nimplemented by the parties. This is essential to ensure\r\nthe success of the third round of United Nations-\r\nsponsored talks, to be held in Islamabad later this month.\r\nThe United Nations must encourage the peaceful\r\nresolution of the Cyprus issue on the basis of a bi-\r\ncommunal and bi-zonal federation, in which the Turkish\r\nCypriot and the Greek Cypriot community would have\r\nequal status.\r\nThe Security Council must act, under Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter, to implement its own resolutions, reverse the\r\nArmenian aggression and restore the unity and territorial\r\nintegrity of Azerbaijan.\r\nWe all bear a collective responsibility for the failure\r\nto halt and reverse Serbian aggression against Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. A holocaust has taken place before the\r\neyes of the world. Two hundred thousand Bosnians,\r\nmostly Muslims, have been killed. Of them, 30,000 were\r\ninnocent children. Forty thousand Muslim women have\r\nbeen systematically raped by the Serbs. Millions of\r\nMuslim men, women and children have been ejected\r\nforcibly and brutally from their homes.\r\nWhile the aggression was going on, the major\r\nPowers went through the motions of promoting peace.\r\nThe Security Council adopted 50 resolutions, but it has\r\nyet to implement them. Mediators appointed by the\r\nUnited Nations and the European Union advocated peace\r\nplans that rewarded the aggressor and penalized the\r\nvictim. Even the right to self-defence has been denied to\r\nthe Bosnians. The United Nations Protection Force has\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nsupervised relief but failed to stop the war or protect the\r\nBosnian people. It was only when the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization carried out - belatedly - the threat of\r\nair strikes that the Serbs halted their onslaught against\r\nGoradze and Sarajevo.\r\nThe Bosnian Serbs have rejected the peace plan, which\r\nis, in truth, unjust to the Bosnian Muslims. It does not\r\nentirely reverse \"ethnic cleansing\". It does not punish the\r\naggressor. It does not ensure the territorial integrity of the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia should be\r\noffered peace with justice, otherwise peace will not endure.\r\nPakistan and other Islamic countries are appalled at the\r\nSecurity Council’s recent decision to ease the sanctions\r\nagainst Belgrade - the root cause of the aggression against\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. This will not stop the flow of\r\nmilitary supplies to the Bosnian Serbs. It will merely\r\nencourage Serbian intransigence.\r\nThe Bosnian Muslims must be allowed to exercise\r\ntheir right to self-defence. Pakistan and other Islamic\r\ncountries fully support the demand for the immediate lifting\r\nof the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\r\nregret the threats by certain countries to withdraw their\r\ntroops from the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) if the embargo is lifted. The Islamic States\r\nwill be ready to contribute their troops to UNPROFOR to\r\ncompensate for any shortfall created by such withdrawals.\r\nWe call for vigorous steps by UNPROFOR to effectively\r\nprotect and provision Sarajevo and other safe areas. We\r\nalso urge the creation of exclusion zones around all safe\r\nareas.\r\nIf expansionism is not stopped in Bosnia, if genocide\r\nis not punished, the virus of war will spread to Kosovo, to\r\nSandjak and perhaps to the entire Balkans. A wider\r\nconflict in this volatile region could have the most serious\r\nconsequences for peace and security in Europe and the\r\nMediterranean.\r\nA grim and bloody struggle is also going on in Jammu\r\nand Kashmir. As in Bosnia, it is an unequal struggle -\r\nbetween the defenceless Kashmiri people and an Indian\r\noccupation force that now numbers 600,000. In Kashmir,\r\nas in Bosnia, the principles of the Charter, of international\r\nlaw and of international morality have been violated with\r\nimpunity.\r\nThe struggle of the Kashmiri people is just and\r\nlegitimate. They were promised by the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council - and by India and Pakistan - that they\r\nwould decide, through a United Nations-supervised\r\nplebiscite, whether they wished to join India or Pakistan.\r\nOn 26 June 1952, the late Prime Minister of India,\r\nMr. Nehru, stated in the Indian Parliament:\r\n\"If, after a proper plebiscite, the people of Kashmir\r\nsaid, ’We do not want to be with India’, we are\r\ncommitted to accept that ... we will not send an\r\narmy against them\".\r\nBut India has gone back on its agreement. It refuses\r\nto implement the Security Council resolutions. It has sent\r\nits army against the people of Kashmir. It has chosen to\r\ncrush the Kashmiri freedom movement by brute force.\r\nOver the past five years, 40,000 Kashmiris have been\r\nkilled; thousands more are in Indian jails. Thousands of\r\nKashmiri women have been raped by Indian soldiers as\r\npart of a policy to break the spirit of the Kashmiri people.\r\nWhole villages and neighbourhoods have been put to the\r\ntorch. Torture is routine; disappearances are common;\r\nand summary executions are standard practice in Kashmir.\r\nIndia’s massive violations of human rights have been\r\nwell documented by impartial organizations and\r\nobservers, such as Amnesty International, Asia Watch, the\r\nInternational Federation of Human Rights, the\r\nInternational Commission of Jurists, Physicians for\r\nHuman Rights and many others. The world knows about\r\nIndian barbarism in Kashmir. It is unfortunate that the\r\nworld has remained silent so far.\r\nWhen faced with the possibility of censure by this\r\nAssembly last year, India offered to resume talks with\r\nPakistan on Kashmir. In the talks held last January, India\r\ndisplayed no desire for a settlement. It repeated the\r\nfiction that Kashmir was an integral part of India. The\r\nIndian Foreign Secretary told us that India had the right\r\nto use as much force as it wanted to prevent Kashmir\r\nfrom breaking away. When the issue was raised at the\r\nCommission on Human Rights, India offered cosmetic\r\nconcessions to prevent the dispatch of a United Nations\r\nfact-finding mission to Kashmir. Thereafter, it denied it\r\nhad made such a deal.\r\nOn the ground as well, India escalated its repression\r\nas soon as international pressure was eased. The day\r\nafter we agreed to resume talks, India conducted a\r\nmassacre in Sopore, killing 50 Kashmiris. Once India\r\nhad concluded that the major Powers would overlook its\r\nhuman rights violations because of the lure of trade and\r\nprofits in India, the repression against the Kashmiris and\r\nthe rhetoric against Pakistan sharply escalated.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nLet me quote from the conclusions of the latest report\r\nof Human Rights Watch/Asia, entitled: India: Continuing\r\nRepression in Kashmir (August 1994, vol. 6, No. 8)\r\n\"As this report amply illustrates, the human\r\nrights situation in Kashmir is getting worse at a time\r\nwhen international pressure on the Indian Government\r\nhas all but ceased. Indeed, it could be argued that the\r\nincrease in deaths in custody and other abuses over\r\nthe last six months is not unrelated to the signals sent\r\nby India’s one-time critics, notably the United States:\r\nthat human rights would no longer feature prominently\r\nin bilateral discussions\". (p. 20)\r\nI have seen the statement made here yesterday by the\r\nCommerce Minister of India. While I can fully subscribe\r\nto the high ideals which he has propounded, I find myself\r\nin the same situation as the distinguished philosopher the\r\nlate Mr. Bertrand Russell, when he observed that\r\n\"When one observes that the high idealism of the\r\nIndian Government in international matters breaks\r\ndown completely with the question of Kashmir, it is\r\ndifficult to avoid a feeling of despair\".\r\nIndia preens itself and postures on the issue of\r\nterrorism. Terrorism is the use of indiscriminate violence\r\nagainst innocent people. This must be condemned. By this\r\nyardstick, India is guilty of daily and systematic acts of\r\nterrorism against the Kashmiris. On the other hand, to\r\nresist a foreign invader, to repel an army of occupation\r\nengaged in murder, torture, rape and arson is not terrorism.\r\nIt is the exercise of self-defence. Self-defence is a right as\r\nold as history; a right recognized in the United Nations\r\nCharter. Distinguished representatives: If your son was\r\nkilled, and his body was thrown on your doorstep, how\r\nwould you respond? If your daughter was gang-raped by\r\nthe soldiers of an occupation army, what would be your\r\nresponse? The Kashmiri people have the right - under\r\ninternational law, under our Charter, under our resolutions\r\n- to resist the Indian army of occupation by all the means\r\nat their disposal. Their heroic struggle cannot be dismissed\r\nas terrorism. It is a valiant freedom movement which\r\ndeserves the full support of the international community.\r\nPakistan is a party to the Kashmir dispute. Our people\r\nare incensed at India’s brutal killing of our Kashmiri\r\nbrothers and sisters. We have, nevertheless, acted with\r\nrestraint. We have extended moral, political and diplomatic\r\nsupport to the Kashmiris.\r\nMr. Blandino Canto (Dominican Republic), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nWe have refrained from extending military help to them.\r\nThe Indian allegations of Pakistan’s support for the\r\nso-called militants are designed to explain away the\r\nresilience of the Kashmiri freedom movement, to erode\r\ninternational sympathy and support for the Kashmiris and,\r\nmore ominously, to create perhaps a casus belli for a new\r\naggression against Pakistan.\r\nThe Kashmir crisis poses a growing threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. On India’s independence\r\nday this year, Prime Minister Rao demanded all of\r\nKashmir. In recent months, Indian politicians and\r\ngenerals have threatened to launch attacks across the Line\r\nof Control. India’s violations of the cease-fire have\r\nescalated. During August alone, the United Nations\r\nMilitary Observer Group for India and Pakistan\r\n(UNMOGIP) recorded 142 complaints from Pakistan of\r\nIndian cease-fire violations. Indian firing across the Line\r\nof Control is specifically aimed at civilians. In the past\r\nfive years, over 600 civilians have been killed on our side\r\nof the line. Pakistan’s self-restraint should not be\r\nmisunderstood. Indian aggression will have disastrous\r\nconsequences.\r\nThere are three priorities in addressing the Kashmir\r\nquestion: first, to avert the threat of a conflict; secondly,\r\nto ameliorate the suffering of the Kashmiri people; and,\r\nthirdly, to open a credible diplomatic process designed to\r\nachieve a just and peaceful solution to the Kashmir\r\ndispute.\r\nTo arrest the threat to peace, I have addressed a\r\nletter to the President of the Security Council proposing\r\nthat the United Nations Military Observer Group for India\r\nand Pakistan should be substantially enlarged from its\r\npresent size of 35 observers. UNMOGIP should be\r\nallowed to perform its mandate of patrolling both sides of\r\nthe Line of Control. This would help to stem cease-fire\r\nviolations, lower tensions and avoid the danger of a\r\nconflict. The enlarged United Nations Observer Group\r\ncould also ascertain the veracity of India’s allegations that\r\nPakistan is providing military assistance to the Kashmiri\r\nstruggle. I hope that the Security Council will approve\r\nour proposal. I hope that India will allow the United\r\nNations Observers to discharge their mandate of patrolling\r\non both sides of the Line of Control.\r\nSecondly, to ameliorate the suffering of the Kashmiri\r\npeople, India should take some genuine steps to halt its\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nrepression. We note with satisfaction that concern about\r\nopinion at this Assembly has convinced India to release at\r\nleast two of the imprisoned Kashmiri leaders. This is a\r\nvictory for the Kashmiri freedom struggle. These aging and\r\nailing leaders will, we hope, be allowed to proceed abroad\r\nfor medical treatment. Shabir Ahmed Shah, who, like\r\nNelson Mandela, has spent 20 years in prison because of\r\nhis commitment to freedom, has not been released. The\r\nworld community must demand the release of this prisoner\r\nof conscience.\r\nThere is no evidence that India has given up its\r\nrepressive strategy in Kashmir. This will become visible\r\nonce India lifts the Draconian emergency laws operative in\r\nKashmir, releases all the Kashmiris detained in Indian jails,\r\nwithdraws a part of its huge force from Kashmir, and\r\nallows human rights organizations and humanitarian\r\nagencies free access to the occupied Valley of Kashmir.\r\nAnd we hope the international community will not forget\r\nthe victims of Indian atrocities. As in Bosnia and Rwanda,\r\nthe human rights violations which have been documented\r\nand reported by impartial agencies must be investigated by\r\nan international tribunal, and those who are found guilty\r\nmust be punished.\r\nFinally, the efforts to promote a political settlement of\r\nthe Jammu and Kashmir dispute must take into account\r\nthree realities.\r\nFirst, the Kashmiri freedom struggle cannot be crushed\r\nby force. New Delhi’s forecasts of imminent success are\r\ndesigned to deceive the Indian public and world public\r\nopinion. The Indian army is caught in a quagmire.\r\nSecondly, despite India’s assertions about Pakistan’s\r\ninterference, the Kashmiri struggle is obviously indigenous.\r\nThe Line of Control in Kashmir has 400 soldiers per\r\nkilometre. The Indians have wired and mined the Line.\r\nNothing can get through. United Nations monitoring of the\r\nLine can verify this. No external force can convince the\r\nKashmiris to offer the kind of sacrifices being made by\r\nKashmiri men, women and children in the cause of\r\nfreedom. For five years the Kashmiris have sustained their\r\nstruggle. They will continue their struggle even if Pakistan\r\nwishes otherwise.\r\nThirdly, no credible Kashmiri group or leader accepts\r\na \"solution\" for Kashmir within the Indian Union. The\r\nso-called political process advertised by India is wishful\r\nthinking. The All Parties Hurriyat Conference, which\r\ngroups 34 Kashmiri political parties and organizations, has\r\nrejected any settlement short of freedom from India.\r\nArriving in Srinagar after his release two days ago,\r\nAbdul Ghani Lone said:\r\n\"Any elections to be held in Kashmir are to be\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations and ... only\r\nfor the right of self-determination\".\r\nThe other released Kashmiri leader, Syed Ali Shah Ghani,\r\nsaid:\r\n\"Elections are no answer to the problem in Kashmir.\r\nThe people of the State do not accept anything short\r\nof freedom. There will be no compromise in the\r\nfight for self-determination\".\r\nIndia’s attempt to organize another fraudulent\r\nelection in Kashmir will prove abortive. As the Security\r\nCouncil declared in 1957, such unilateral actions cannot\r\nbe considered as the basis for the \"final disposition\" of\r\nJammu and Kashmir. This can only be done through a\r\nUnited Nations-supervised plebiscite prescribed by the\r\nSecurity Council. A final settlement of the Kashmir\r\ndispute will have to be based on the freely expressed\r\nwishes of the Kashmiri people. In a paper transmitted to\r\nIndia last February, Pakistan outlined the possible\r\nmodalities for ascertaining their wishes.\r\nPakistan welcomes the Secretary-General’s offer to\r\nexert every possible effort to \"facilitate the search for a\r\nlasting solution to the Kashmir issue\" (A/49/1, para. 542).\r\nWe hope India will also accept the Secretary-General’s\r\noffer of good offices, as Pakistan has done. Pakistan is\r\nprepared for talks with India on Kashmir. It was Pakistan\r\nwhich initiated the Foreign Secretary-level talks. But\r\nafter six rounds of talks it is evident to us that India’s\r\nostensible desire for negotiations with Pakistan carries\r\nlittle credibility while it continues the killing in Kashmir.\r\nPakistan does not reject dialogue, but it must not be a\r\ndialogue of the deaf.\r\nKashmir is a dispute between India and Pakistan.\r\nEvery dispute between two States is bilateral. It is also\r\nan international issue. The United Nations is obliged to\r\ntake cognizance of such disputes, specially when they\r\ninvolve violations of the United Nations Charter and the\r\nnon-implementation of Security Council resolutions.\r\nKashmir is the key to unlocking the problems of\r\nSouth Asia. Kashmir cannot be brushed aside any longer.\r\nThe conspiracy of silence must be broken. A resolution\r\nof the Kashmir situation is required to avoid the danger\r\nof a conflict. A solution of the Kashmir dispute will also\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nenhance the prospects of conventional arms control and\r\nnon-proliferation in South Asia.\r\nMy Government believes that to reduce the danger of\r\nwar in South Asia it is essential to promote a balance in\r\nconventional arms between Pakistan and India, at the lowest\r\npossible levels. India fields the third largest army in the\r\nworld. Almost all of it is deployed against Pakistan.\r\nDuring the past decade India was the world’s largest arms\r\nimporter. Even during the Afghan war, India’s arms\r\nacquisitions were over five times those of Pakistan.\r\nPakistan’s defence capabilities have deteriorated further\r\nsince 1990. Last year, while Pakistan’s defence spending\r\ndeclined in real terms, India’s increased by 20 per cent.\r\nPakistan has made several proposals to India for\r\nconventional arms control: negotiation of a mutually\r\nagreed ratio of forces; measures to prevent the possibilities\r\nof a surprise attack, adoption of agreed principles for\r\nconventional arms control in South Asia.\r\nPakistan has no desire to expend more of its scarce\r\nresources on arms. Meaningful arms control and\r\nconfidence-building measures could also help to stem the\r\ndanger of a nuclear arms race in our region.\r\nPakistan’s concern about nuclear proliferation in South\r\nAsia precedes the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). As\r\nearly as the mid-1960s Pakistan had warned the world that\r\nIndia would misuse nuclear cooperation. The late Prime\r\nMinister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto proposed the creation of a\r\nSouth Asia nuclear-free zone in 1972. In May 1974 India\r\nexploded the bomb - ironically calling it the \"Smiling\r\nBuddha\". Pakistan made every endeavour to counter\r\nproliferation in South Asia. Apart from the nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone, we advanced subsequent proposals: for\r\nthe simultaneous signature of the NPT by India and\r\nPakistan, for acceptance of full-scope safeguards, for joint\r\nrenunciation of nuclear weapons, for a bilateral test-ban\r\ntreaty. All have been spurned by India. A proposal made\r\nby the United States for a conference to promote\r\nnon-proliferation in South Asia, involving Russia, the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China and the United States, as well\r\nas India and Pakistan, was also rejected by New Delhi.\r\nPakistan has displayed responsibility and restraint in\r\nthe nuclear field. While we have acquired a certain\r\ntechnological capability, we have not manufactured or\r\nexploded a nuclear device. We have not deployed nuclear\r\nweapons. We have not transferred sensitive technologies.\r\nTwenty years after exploding its nuclear bomb, India\r\nis about to take another fateful step towards proliferation:\r\nthe production and deployment of nuclear-capable ballistic\r\nmissiles. India is continuing work on its medium-range\r\nAGNI missile as well as on intercontinental ballistic\r\nmissiles. It conducted user trials of the short-range\r\nPrithvi this year. The Prithvi is a mobile missile. Once\r\nit is produced, Pakistan will have to presume that it has\r\nbeen deployed.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIt is still not too late to prevent nuclear-weapon\r\nproliferation in South Asia. Pakistan suggests two critical\r\nsteps to avoid this danger.\r\nFirst, we suggest an agreement between India and\r\nPakistan not to develop or deploy ballistic missiles.\r\nIndia’s production and deployment of the Prithvi will\r\ninvite a matching response from Pakistan. We have\r\nadvanced the concept of a Zero Missile Zone in South\r\nAsia. This objective should be endorsed by the world\r\ncommunity.\r\nSecondly, we suggest an agreement between India\r\nand Pakistan not to manufacture or deploy nuclear\r\nweapons. We hope India will respond positively to this\r\nlongstanding proposal. We hope it will agree, as a first\r\nstep, to issue a joint declaration with Pakistan renouncing\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nIt is unfortunate that India and Pakistan have never\r\nsucceeded in solving any of their disputes through\r\nbilateral negotiations. Agreements reached on two major\r\nproblems - the Indus Waters Treaty and the Rann of\r\nKutch Accord - were made possible by the intercession of\r\na third party.\r\nAt this critical moment, when tensions are high and\r\npeace is threatened in South Asia, the States Members of\r\nthe United Nations have a fundamental responsibility to\r\nbring to bear their collective influence to promote\r\nsolutions to the interlinked problems of Kashmir,\r\nconventional arms conflict and non-proliferation.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nPakistan desires good-neighbourly relations with India.\r\nWe want our people to devote their energies to the vital\r\ntask of nation-building. We want to banish from our midst\r\nthe spectre of rampant poverty. We want our people to live\r\nwith dignity. These goals cannot be attained unless we\r\nresolve the Kashmir problem and others and build a climate\r\nof trust and confidence in South Asia.\r\nPakistan has embarked on a new path of\r\nsocio-economic revival and growth. We have released the\r\ndynamism of our private sector. We have created an\r\neconomic climate that is most hospitable to domestic and\r\nforeign investment, and the results have been most\r\ngratifying. Agreements for foreign investment of $4 billion\r\nwere concluded 10 days ago with a delegation led by the\r\nUnited States Secretary of Energy. Additional investment\r\nis likely in the energy, telecommunications, electronics and\r\nother dynamic sectors of the Pakistan economy.\r\nToday, Pakistan and all of South Asia have the chance\r\nto break out of the cycle of poverty and underdevelopment.\r\nWe must not lose this chance. We must not let history pass\r\nus by again.\r\nWe meet on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. The end of the cold war has released both\r\npositive and negative forces that were long suppressed.\r\nThe principles of democracy, human rights and free markets\r\nhave triumphed. We have celebrated the entry into the\r\nUnited Nations of many new States, proud and free. The\r\nvictory of democracy has been achieved in South Africa.\r\nThe victory of peace may well be realized in the Middle\r\nEast. Today, there is no threat of a global nuclear war.\r\nUnprecedented affluence has been achieved in parts of the\r\nworld. Momentous technological breakthroughs have been\r\nmade. We now have the potential to achieve global peace,\r\naddress global problems and promote global prosperity.\r\nBut even as we celebrate these victories, the triumphs\r\nof reason and statesmanship, we must confront the dark\r\nforces of aggression, racism, fascism and bigotry, which\r\nhave again raised their head in many parts of the world.\r\nIt is, perhaps, not surprising that once the restraints of\r\nthe cold war structures were lifted, conflicts and disputes -\r\nbetween States and within them - should have erupted like\r\nan epidemic. The world community has been unprepared\r\nto confront and repel aggression - witness Bosnia,\r\nAzerbaijan and Kashmir. We have been unable to muster\r\nthe political will to stop genocide - witness Rwanda. We\r\nare unprepared to pay the price to help the hungry and save\r\nthe deprived of the Earth - witness the Sahel.\r\nThe principal task of this session must be to revive\r\nhope, to restore the confidence of our peoples, that we,\r\nthe States Members of the United Nations, acting\r\ntogether, can build peace where it is broken; that we can\r\nbring solace to those who are suffering; that we can\r\nuphold and enforce justice where this is needed; and that\r\nwe can enlarge the horizons of prosperity to embrace\r\nthose teeming millions who are imprisoned in poverty.\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan\r\nBin Talal, Crown Prince of the Hashemite\r\nKingdom of Jordan\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the Crown Prince\r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince El Hassan Bin Talal,\r\nCrown Prince of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Crown Prince of Jordan,\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince El Hassan Bin Talal, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nPrince El Hassan Bin Talal: It is my pleasure, at\r\nthe outset, to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\r\nelection and to wish you and the members of the Bureau\r\nevery success in the discharge of your duties. Your\r\nelection is a mark of the confidence and high regard in\r\nwhich both you and your country are held by the\r\ninternational community. Your wisdom and your\r\nforbearance will be crucial to the successful outcome of\r\nthe current session.\r\nI should like to express deep appreciation for the\r\nexemplary manner in which your predecessor conducted\r\nthe work of the Assembly during his tenure last year. I\r\nalso wish to express my gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless\r\nefforts to enhance the Organization’s ability to meet the\r\nchallenges of a rapidly evolving world.\r\nIt is gratifying to observe that the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations now encompasses several recently\r\nindependent States. We share bonds of religious and\r\ncultural affinity with some; we share friendships and\r\nmutual respect with all. We hope that the principle of\r\nuniversality, which has always been the cornerstone of the\r\nUnited Nations, will soon encompass the remaining\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\npeoples and regions, so that this Organization can truly\r\nrepresent the collective conscience of mankind.\r\nIt is, I believe, fitting to extend heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to President Nelson Mandela, to\r\nVice-President Frederik De Klerk, and to the people of\r\nSouth Africa. They have together established a new order\r\nin their country, one founded on justice and equality. The\r\nworld rejoices at the return of South Africa to the fold of\r\nthe international community of nations. The South African\r\npeople have proved that peace is always possible, so long\r\nas all are given the chance to participate in its building.\r\nThis is a theme that bears consideration.\r\nAs we approach a landmark in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations - the fiftieth anniversary of its foundation -\r\nit is appropriate to look forward rather than back; to take\r\nstock of things to come rather than things past. It is\r\nappropriate to consider the shape that our global order is\r\ntaking.\r\nSouth Africa offers a new paradigm, a fresh vision for\r\na changing world. It shows us that a new order must have\r\nroom for everyone. We must be able to listen to all voices:\r\nto the weak and the powerful alike. A new order must be\r\ninclusive and must actively encourage participation at every\r\nlevel: for in our ever- more interdependent world, the\r\nfuture of one is the future of all. This, I believe, goes to the\r\nvery heart of global peace.\r\nWe are called upon, then, to articulate a new\r\napproach. We must protect the rule of law, but we must go\r\nfurther, and ensure that democracy, pluralism and respect\r\nfor human rights come to govern the life of nations. We\r\nmust evolve new procedures of cooperation, communication\r\nand accommodation. We must promote social\r\nresponsibility, national commitment and international\r\nobligation. Nations must learn to coexist with their\r\nneighbours; but more than this, they must learn to work\r\nwillingly together as partners in the enterprise of peace.\r\nSuch a transformation is taking place in the Middle\r\nEast. My region has been synonymous with conflict and\r\nwar for decades. At last we have an historic opportunity to\r\nresolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, and to fashion in its place\r\na new commonwealth of peace, hope and participation for\r\nall.\r\nThe question of Palestine has been Jordan’s main\r\nconcern. Family ties, geographic contiguity, and shared\r\nhistory and traditions ensure that this is so. Over the years,\r\nJordan has extended support and encouragement to our\r\nPalestinian brethren. Our contributions and sacrifices to\r\nthe Palestinian cause from 1948 onwards have been\r\nwidely acknowledged. My country has received\r\nsuccessive waves of refugees and returnees, at a huge cost\r\nto our economy, imposing an impossible burden on our\r\nlimited resources. Yet we remain committed to our\r\ndemocratization process, to the protection of civil liberties\r\nand human rights, and to the provision of decent living\r\nconditions and services for all our citizens. Underlying\r\nthis commitment is our belief that broad-based popular\r\ninvolvement in civil society is fundamental to its health.\r\nThis is why Jordan has been able to weather the ravages\r\nof war, to survive the long years of turmoil in our region.\r\nIf Jordan has been on the front line of war, so too\r\nhas it been on the front line of peace. In those well-\r\nknown words of Security Council resolution 242 (1967),\r\nwhich my country helped to draft, Jordan has always\r\nworked steadfastly for a just, lasting and comprehensive\r\npeace in the Middle East. We promoted the genesis of\r\nthe current process with the Madrid Conference of 1991.\r\nWhen the Israeli Government of the day refused to\r\nnegotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\n(PLO), Jordan stepped into the breach, helping the\r\nPalestinians to assume their proper role by providing an\r\numbrella for their participation.\r\nNow the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of\r\nthe Palestinian people, is negotiating directly with Israel.\r\nThey are installed in Gaza and Jericho, and conduct their\r\naffairs as they see fit: their destiny is at last in their own\r\nhands. Jordan welcomes these developments, and will\r\ncontinue to do everything in its power to ensure the\r\nsuccess of Palestinian autonomy arrangements.\r\nOn the Jordanian-Israeli track, our common agenda\r\nhas paved the way for us to agree upon modalities in\r\nareas such as water, the environment, energy, territory,\r\nborders and regional security. These agreements resulted\r\nin the meeting between His Majesty King Hussein and\r\nPrime Minister Rabin of Israel, on 25 July 1994, at which\r\nthey signed the Washington Declaration. This historic\r\ndocument ended the state of war between Jordan and\r\nIsrael. I myself have just held constructive talks with\r\nPresident Clinton and Foreign Minister Peres, the goal of\r\nwhich is to build a framework of trilateral development as\r\nwell as an economic equilibrium in the region, and to\r\nmaintain the momentum towards peace.\r\nJordan and Israel are engaged in substantive talks,\r\nseeking just and mutually agreeable solutions to the\r\noutstanding issues listed in our common agenda. Our aim\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nis to conclude a treaty of peace based on solid grounds that\r\ncan withstand the winds of change. Such a treaty, we\r\nbelieve, will delineate our rights and duties under\r\nconditions of peace. It will open the door to cooperation at\r\nthe regional level, so that the benefits of peace may be\r\nenjoyed by our peoples. It has always been Jordan’s vision\r\nthat the Middle East, cradle of civilization and birthplace of\r\nthe three great monotheistic religions, should be a region of\r\ncultural tolerance and mutual interdependence.\r\nImportant as our bilateral talks with Israel may be, we\r\nare keenly aware that no two nations stand alone. Our aim\r\nremains a comprehensive peace. Many of the issues we are\r\ncurrently addressing defy the confines of bilateralism and\r\nrequire regional and international participation.\r\nOne such issue concerns the spiritual significance of\r\nthe city of Jerusalem. For believers in the three great\r\nmonotheistic faiths, Jerusalem must be the ultimate symbol\r\nof peace and its glorious manifestation. A final settlement\r\non the political and administrative status of the city,\r\nhowever, will occur in negotiations between Palestinians\r\nand Israelis. Any arrangement reached must serve the\r\nneeds of the millions of followers of Islam, Christianity and\r\nJudaism.\r\nThe economic dimension of peace is likewise a\r\ntransnational concern. The economies of the Middle East\r\nhave been shattered by the conflict. They must be revived\r\nif peace is to take root on the ground. Access to more\r\nequitable opportunities for economic growth will be vital.\r\nInternational debt relief and write-off strategies should be\r\nplanned, encompassing improved concessionary terms by\r\nthe Clubs of Paris and London.\r\nBut the States of the region must also play their part.\r\nRestrictions on trade should be relaxed. We must develop\r\na non-discriminatory approach to sustainable development\r\nand economic well-being. We hope that the Middle\r\nEast-North Africa Economic Summit at Casablanca will\r\nbuild on the achievements of the Regional Economic\r\nDevelopment Working Group and prove a useful forum to\r\nexplore the potential partnership between Governments,\r\nprivate businesses and international financial institutions -\r\nfor this partnership surely holds the key to the economic\r\nfuture of the region.\r\nInternational changes wrought by the end of the cold\r\nwar have affected the political situation in the Middle East\r\nas elsewhere. The transformation of world power politics\r\nhas been accompanied by a shift in attitude, modifying the\r\ncost benefit calculus of regional States. National strategic\r\nobjectives can no longer be sought at the cost of others in\r\na supposedly \"zero sum game\". In the context of a\r\nregional security regime, the size, the role and the\r\nfunction of the armed forces in individual States of the\r\nregion are likely to undergo radical changes. These will\r\nfavour peace-keeping functions, allowing scarce resources\r\nto be released for development needs.\r\nln this context, Jordan fully supports the five\r\ndimensions of world peace and security outlined by the\r\nSecretary-General. I would like to add that Jordan\r\nsupports the ongoing effort to streamline the United\r\nNations, and fully endorses the attempt to increase the\r\nnumber of permanent members on the Security Council.\r\nWe also support the American proposal that\r\npeace-keeping operations be strengthened by additional\r\npersonnel, more effective field capabilities, greater\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and participating\r\ncountries and a more united approach to training.\r\nHere again, Jordan is at the forefront of change.\r\nOur armed forces as peace-keepers under the United\r\nNations command as far afield as Georgia, Angola and\r\nthe former Yugoslavia value the opportunity to take part\r\nin these missions, for in a very real sense, they allow us\r\nto participate in the unfolding world order. Jordan is\r\nproud to be involved in shaping global security\r\narrangements.\r\nAs the peace process develops, it will be necessary\r\nto promote a common regional identity and a shared\r\nregional vision. All the Middle East must contribute to\r\nthe articulation of this vision. The key, again, is\r\nparticipation. If the countries and peoples of the region\r\nhave a say in shaping its future, they will have a stake in\r\nits success. And success will accordingly be all the more\r\nlikely; for the diversity of our region is a positive asset\r\nthat we must learn to use creatively. We will inevitably\r\ndiffer on certain issues, just as we will agree on others.\r\nBut we must be able to discuss our views in the\r\nknowledge that they will be heard, for honest\r\ncommunication is the basis of genuine involvement in any\r\njoint enterprise.\r\nIn this spirit, Jordan feels honour-bound to register\r\nits concern over threats to the process of global\r\nreconciliation. Inertia must not be allowed to dominate\r\nthe conduct of world affairs. Deep-seated conflicts will\r\nnot disappear by themselves. We urge the international\r\ncommunity of States to take swift action to facilitate their\r\nresolution.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nOne glaring example is the ongoing situation in Bosnia\r\nHerzegovina. The appalling practices of \"ethnic cleansing\"\r\nand genocide continue even as we speak. My country\r\nabhors these atrocities. Jordan supports all the international\r\ncommunity’s efforts to end this tragic and wasteful conflict,\r\nand we have taken positive steps to alleviate the hardship\r\nit has caused. Jordan has joined the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement’s task force on Bosnia. Our soldiers, who form\r\nthe second largest contingent of the United Nations\r\npeace-keeping effort in the Balkans, are engaged in both\r\nhumanitarian relief and peace-keeping duties. Jordan has\r\nsupported the Vienna and Washington Agreements to\r\nestablish a federation between the Muslims and Croats of\r\nBosnia, and has welcomed the peace plan advanced by the\r\nContact Group, supported by the G-7 summit in Naples.\r\nThe Serbian challenge to the plan, in the face of Muslim\r\nand Croat acceptance, is cause for deep disappointment.\r\nI turn now to the situation in the Gulf. The\r\nimportance of stability and security cannot be overstated.\r\nInternational norms must be observed; the territorial\r\nintegrity of all States must be preserved. Their sovereignty\r\nand political independence must be upheld on the basis of\r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs. My country also\r\nwishes to reiterate its serious concern for the plight of the\r\npeople of Iraq, where living conditions are deteriorating\r\nrapidly. We intend to do our utmost to alleviate the\r\nsuffering of the Iraqi people, so far as is consistent with the\r\nprovisions of United Nations resolutions.\r\nThe distorted image of Islam remains a cause for\r\ngrave concern. The attention of this body should be turned\r\nto the spreading of Islamophobia, or hate for Muslims.\r\nThis phenomenon occurs in all manner of ways, from the\r\npurely verbal to the bluntly physical. Its proponents deal\r\nin inflammatory rhetoric. They preach the inevitability of\r\ncultural apocalypse, tarring all Muslims with the brush of\r\nfanatical extremism. They ignore the fact that Islam is a\r\nbroad and adaptable concept and institution. One billion\r\nMuslims now live on this earth. Thus, Islam encompasses\r\nall shades of political opinion, different patterns of\r\ntheological thought, and countless varieties of human\r\nexperience.\r\nJordan urges Member States to join forces in bringing\r\nabout a better understanding of Islam as a religion, a\r\nculture and a civilization. The expression of anti-Muslim\r\nsentiment, and other manifestations of Islamophobia, should\r\nbe monitored and combated by educational campaigns,\r\ncultural exchanges and similar endeavours. We have\r\nalways advocated an interfaith dialogue as the surest way\r\nto combat bigotry and stereotyping.\r\nMore than a decade ago now, I stood before this\r\nAssembly and called, on behalf of my country, for a new\r\ninternational humanitarian order. That led to the\r\nestablishment of the Independent Commission on\r\nInternational Humanitarian Issues. The Commission was\r\ncharged with investigating a wide range of pressing\r\nhumanitarian issues. It performed its duties well,\r\nproducing a series of reports that made clear the scale of\r\nthe impending global humanitarian disaster.\r\nIt would be comforting to stand before this\r\nAssembly today and tell it that its work has made a\r\nsignificant difference. It would be comforting, but it\r\nwould not be true. A new international humanitarian\r\norder has not come into being. The powerless remain\r\npowerless. The dispossessed have not recovered their\r\nbirthrights. There are more refugees, more street\r\nchildren, more innocent victims of conflict than ever\r\nbefore. What is worse, these issues are still addressed in\r\na piecemeal fashion. It is often said that one should not\r\ntry to treat a mass of symptoms, but to seek out root\r\ncauses. Remarkably, it sometimes seems that far from\r\nseeking causes we are doing our best to ignore the\r\nsymptoms.\r\nToday, I have tried to address causes. I have spoken\r\nof the fundamental need for participation at all levels. I\r\nhave put before the Assembly a vision of a global order\r\ncharacterized by partnership and communication, tolerance\r\nand trust. In some places this vision is on the road to\r\nrealization; in others, it has seldom been more remote.\r\nThe alternatives are very clear, and the choice is ours.\r\nI pledge my country’s full support to this\r\nOrganization, for as we move towards the twenty-first\r\ncentury, and as the Organization moves towards its\r\nfiftieth anniversary, the ideal that inspired the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations has never been more important.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nCrown Prince of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince El Hassan Bin Talal,\r\nCrown Prince of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ali Alatas.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nMr. Alatas (Indonesia): It gives me great pleasure to\r\nextend to you, also on behalf of the Indonesian delegation,\r\nour congratulations on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. We are\r\ngratified that the stewardship of this session is entrusted to\r\na seasoned diplomat and statesman, representing a fraternal\r\nAfrican country with which Indonesia has traditionally\r\nenjoyed close relations of friendship and cooperation.\r\nMay I also express our deep appreciation to your\r\ndistinguished predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador\r\nInsanally of Guyana, for so capably guiding our work\r\nduring a most eventful year.\r\nI join other members in paying tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General for his determined efforts to resolve\r\nvarious conflict situations across the globe and his\r\nendeavours to make the United Nations a more efficient\r\nand effective instrument of global governance in these\r\nchallenging times.\r\nWe meet at a time of pervasive change and transition,\r\na time in which global problems appear less susceptible to\r\neasy solutions, earlier concepts and approaches less relevant\r\nand existing institutions less effective. It is also a time of\r\ncontradictions and paradoxes in which resurgent hopes are\r\nnurtured amidst deepening anxieties and bright new\r\nopportunities are overcast by unprecedented challenges in\r\na world that is coalescing and fragmenting at the same\r\ntime.\r\nThe euphoria which permeated the international\r\ncommunity at the end of the cold war has dissipated and is\r\nbeing replaced by a growing sense of uncertainty, disquiet\r\nand disillusionment. With the sobering experience of the\r\nGulf war and the horrendous incidence of \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\" and violence in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia\r\nand Rwanda, there is far less certainty now on how best to\r\nrespond to the demands and vicissitudes of a world of\r\ndeepening interdependence among countries and the\r\nglobalization of ever more intricate and inter-linked\r\nproblems of peace, security and development. Our greatest\r\nchallenge, therefore, is how collectively to fashion a more\r\neffective system of global governance to manage the\r\nmassive changes that are transforming the shape and\r\nsubstance of international relations in the decades ahead.\r\nIf the pursuit of this basic objective is to succeed,\r\nthere can be no doubt that it should be based on the\r\nrecognition of the United Nations as its centre-piece and\r\nprincipal mechanism. The United Nations is the only\r\nuniversal institution we have today, and any system of\r\nglobal governance, to be viable and to achieve common\r\nacceptance by the world community as a whole, must be\r\nfirmly rooted in the principles and purposes of the United\r\nNations Charter and organized on the precepts of\r\nsovereign equality, common interest and benefit, equitably\r\nshared responsibility and joint commitment to global\r\ncooperation.\r\nIt is therefore vitally important that the effectiveness\r\nand dynamism of our Organization be ensured and\r\nmaintained. Since the United Nations was founded\r\nalmost five decades ago, the world has changed almost\r\nbeyond recognition, and international problems have\r\nbecome immensely more complex. The United Nations\r\ntoday bears a heavier load of responsibilities than it has\r\never borne. Ironically, at this time it is also saddled with\r\na deepening financial crisis. This paradoxical situation,\r\nin which the United Nations is expected to deal with a\r\nmultitude of problems while woefully strapped for funds,\r\ncannot continue without adverse consequences for the\r\nworld community.\r\nJust as important is the need to ensure that the\r\nUnited Nations system remains faithful to the democratic\r\nprinciples on which it was founded and attuned to the\r\nrealities of the times. We therefore believe that the\r\nprocess of reforming the United Nations system should go\r\nbeyond merely improving its procedures and practices and\r\nshould, inter alia, take into account such essential aspects\r\nas the representation of Member States at all levels of the\r\nsystem and their effective participation in decision-making\r\nprocesses. The General Assembly should play a central\r\nrole in shaping that process at the same time as its work\r\nis being continually rationalized.\r\nOn the question of an increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council, my delegation has clearly defined its\r\nposition on various occasions in the past. The last review\r\nof the Council’s composition was undertaken nearly three\r\ndecades ago. Since then there has been a tremendous\r\nincrease in the number of United Nations Members, thus\r\nrendering the enlargement of the Council a matter of\r\nurgency. Such an increase should take into account the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographic representation and\r\naccommodate the interests and concerns of the developing\r\ncountries, which comprise the overwhelming majority in\r\nthe Organization. Furthermore, my delegation supports\r\nthe proposal to increase the number of permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. In this respect, it is\r\nour view that, while the principle of geographic\r\nrepresentation is important, it should not be the only\r\ncriterion to determine eligibility for new permanent\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nmembers. We believe that other objective criteria are\r\nequally important: political, economic and demographic\r\nrealities; a country’s capability and record of contributing\r\nto the promotion of peace, security and economic\r\ndevelopment, both regionally and globally; and the\r\ncommitment of States to assume the responsibilities\r\ninherent in such a status. In these endeavours our goals\r\nmust remain the promotion of transparency, legitimacy,\r\naccountability and efficiency.\r\nIn the economic and social fields, as well as in\r\ndevelopment cooperation, it has been said that the United\r\nNations system operates without sufficient coordination and\r\ncoherence. However, in addressing this concern, we do not\r\nsee the particular merit of a proposal for the establishment\r\nof an economic security council at this time. Rather, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council should be further\r\nstrengthened and should be allowed to assert its full role as\r\nenvisioned in the United Nations Charter. In this regard, I\r\nthink it would be productive to invite the Ministers\r\nresponsible for finance and development planning, or other\r\nrelevant Ministers, to participate in the deliberations on\r\nimportant development issues at the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil’s high-level segment meetings. The United\r\nNations should also continue to strengthen its coordination\r\nwith the Bretton Woods institutions so as to achieve\r\nincreased policy coherence and to enhance development\r\ncooperation.\r\nAlthough the demise of the cold war has reduced the\r\nthreat of nuclear war, it has not eliminated the danger posed\r\nby nuclear weapons. Nuclear disarmament remains an\r\nimperative. It is hoped that with further success in the\r\ncritical area of limiting and reducing armaments, the\r\nquantitative growth of nuclear weapons will soon be\r\ncurbed. Recent encouraging developments include a\r\nsignificant reduction of the world’s two largest nuclear\r\narsenals as a result of the successful conclusion of the\r\nTreaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic\r\nOffensive Arms (START II) and of the fact that a\r\nmoratorium on nuclear tests continues to be observed by\r\nmost of the nuclear-weapon States.\r\nIn this context, the importance of a comprehensive\r\ntest-ban treaty as a major step towards nuclear disarmament\r\nand as an urgent measure to protect the environment cannot\r\nbe overemphasized. For this reason, the Conference on\r\nDisarmament has been given a clear and explicit mandate\r\nto negotiate a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing.\r\nUnfortunately, lack of political will on the part of some\r\nnuclear-weapon States has created obstacles to progress in\r\nthis vital work. It is essential that serious and concerted\r\nefforts be undertaken in the Conference on Disarmament\r\nin conjunction with the broader multilateral endeavours in\r\nthe Amendment Conference on the partial test-ban Treaty\r\nto ensure the conclusion of a universal and effectively\r\nverifiable treaty within a fixed time-frame. Such a treaty,\r\nwe believe, would serve as a truly credible instrument of\r\na nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nThe convening of the 1995 review and extension\r\nConference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\r\nprovides a unique opportunity to make a sober assessment\r\nof its implementation. It is beyond doubt that the\r\nquestion of the extension of the NPT is linked to such\r\ncritical issues as nuclear disarmament, the dissemination\r\nof nuclear know-how for peaceful purposes, security\r\nassurances to non-nuclear States and the establishment of\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones. Hence, the issues we face\r\nnext year should not be oversimplified to a mere choice\r\nbetween limited and unlimited duration or between\r\nconditional and unconditional extension of the NPT. The\r\nlongevity of the Treaty will ultimately depend upon the\r\nresolution of these multifarious issues and the sincerity of\r\nthe nuclear-weapon States in fulfilling their obligations.\r\nRegional and subregional organizations continue to\r\nmake substantial contributions to the cause of\r\ndisarmament and peace. In the Asia-Pacific region, the\r\nRegional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) was launched last July in Bangkok,\r\nreflecting the desire of the countries of the region to\r\nensure a peaceful and stable political and security\r\nenvironment for their peoples. This forum is unique\r\nbecause it was not established in response to a crisis but,\r\nrather, as an exercise in preventive diplomacy to manage\r\nstrategic change in such a way that a stable relationship\r\namong the major Powers as well as among the regional\r\nPowers will evolve gradually and peacefully over the next\r\ndecade. At the same time ASEAN is intensifying its\r\nefforts to realize its blueprint for a zone of peace,\r\nfreedom and neutrality with a South-East Asian nuclear\r\nweapon-free zone as its component part. Its realization\r\nwould be a major step towards stable peace in the region\r\nand a significant regional contribution to global\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nAlthough the Asia-Pacific region now enjoys relative\r\npeace, it is by no means free of tension and the anxiety\r\nof potential conflict. Among the actual and potential\r\nproblems that the region must face is the persistence of\r\ninter-State disputes, especially territorial disputes and\r\noverlapping claims of sovereignty which could intensify\r\nif their potential for conflict were not effectively\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nmanaged. That was why in its Manila Declaration of 1992,\r\nASEAN stressed that its Treaty of Amity and Cooperation\r\nshould serve as a basis for the establishment of a code of\r\ninternational conduct in the area and thus called for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the non-use of force.\r\nThe positive response of the major Powers and of the\r\ncountries of the region towards the Treaty serving as such\r\na code of conduct at the first meeting of the ASEAN\r\nRegional Forum makes it even more necessary to promote\r\ncooperative efforts among countries that have overlapping\r\nclaims of sovereignty in the South China Sea in order to\r\nensure the peaceful development of the area.\r\nAs regards the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula,\r\nthe agreement reached last August between the\r\nGovernments of the United States and the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea was a major step towards a\r\nresolution of this problem. We continue to believe that this\r\ncomplex issue can be resolved only through the exercise of\r\nmutual restraint and through sincere and sustained dialogue\r\nand negotiations.\r\nIn the Middle East, the pursuit of peace continues to\r\ngather momentum and promises to herald a new era. The\r\nhistoric Declaration of Principles signed between the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization and the Government of\r\nIsrael over a year ago has been followed by the Accord\r\nsigned in Cairo last March, which laid down the modalities\r\nfor transition to Palestinian self-government in the Gaza\r\nStrip and Jericho and thus paved the way for the triumphant\r\nreturn of President Yasser Arafat to these areas. Yet\r\nanother breakthrough is the signing of the Washington\r\nDeclaration between Jordan and Israel which ended the\r\nstate of war between them and opens the way for the\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty.\r\nWhile my delegation welcomes these positive\r\ndevelopments, we are also acutely conscious of the\r\nformidable challenges that still lie ahead. Palestinian\r\nautonomy should now be widened to include the economic,\r\nsocial and cultural aspects of national life, and Palestinian\r\nself-rule should now be extended throughout occupied\r\nPalestinian territories. Furthermore, the international\r\ncommunity should expedite its promised assistance to the\r\nPalestinian Authority in rebuilding the necessary\r\ninfrastructures. It is also self-evident that progress on the\r\nother tracks of Arab-Israeli negotiations is a sine qua non\r\nfor a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question\r\non the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\r\n338 (1973) and 425 (1978). The ultimate guarantee for\r\npeace is Israel’s withdrawal from all occupied territories,\r\nincluding the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon.\r\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the atrocities, senseless\r\nkillings of civilians and \"ethnic cleansing\" perpetrated by\r\nthe Bosnian Serbs have continued unabated. The pleas of\r\nthe Bosnian Government for effective international\r\nintervention or at least the lifting of the ill-conceived\r\narms embargo have gone unheeded. The savagery of the\r\nconflict has few historical precedents and the ambivalence\r\nof the international community has contributed to its\r\nperpetuation and the ever-present threat of a spill-over.\r\nBy rejecting the latest peace plan proposed by the Contact\r\nGroup, the Bosnian Serbs have dealt a serious set-back to\r\ninternational efforts to end the conflict.\r\nMr. Piriz Ballon (Uruguay), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe carnage cannot just go on. It is incumbent upon\r\nthe Security Council to unequivocally pronounce itself on\r\nthe non-applicability of resolution 713 (1991) concerning\r\nthe imposition of an arms embargo on Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. Furthermore, in the face of the continued\r\nintransigence of the Bosnian Serbs, the Security Council\r\nmust take strong and determined measures in order to\r\nensure the realization of the peace plan. Concurrently,\r\nthe international community should consider devising a\r\nmechanism for negotiations, including the convening of\r\nan appropriately structured international conference, to\r\ndeal with the wider aspects of the conflict in and around\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, leading ultimately to a\r\ncomprehensive solution that would enable the people in\r\nthat region to live securely in peace, free from aggression,\r\ndomination and external interference.\r\nEarlier this year, the people of South Africa finally\r\nput an end to apartheid by holding the first-ever\r\nnon-racial elections and by subsequently installing the\r\nfirst, democratically elected government under President\r\nNelson Mandela. We have all joyously welcomed this\r\nhistoric event as well as South Africa’s resumption of its\r\nrightful place in the community of nations. Indonesia\r\nlooks forward to developing close and mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation with the new Government and the people of\r\nSouth Africa.\r\nElsewhere in Africa, however, we were deeply\r\nanguished to witness in Rwanda the rampage of violence\r\nwhich has triggered an exodus of refugees to\r\nneighbouring countries and has brought about a\r\nhumanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions. With the\r\nend of fighting and bloodshed and the establishment of\r\nthe new government in Kigali, we hope that the parties\r\nconcerned will resume the process of national\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nreconciliation based on the Arusha Agreement, which\r\nindeed provides an appropriate framework for the purpose.\r\nThe situation in Somalia continues to be marked by\r\nrecurrent outbreaks of violence and a deterioration of the\r\nsecurity situation. We remain convinced that a solution to\r\nthe civil strife in that country can only be achieved through\r\nsustained dialogue among all the parties, under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU). In this context, we hope for the early\r\nconvening of the national reconciliation conference in\r\naccordance with the Declaration of last March by the\r\nleaders of Somalia.\r\nThe entry into force of the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea next month represents the\r\nculmination of efforts begun over two decades ago to create\r\na new order for the oceans. The Convention, which\r\nIndonesia ratified in 1985, will make a significant\r\ncontribution in promoting the peaceful uses of the seas and\r\nin ensuring their equitable utilization.\r\nI do agree with the report of the Secretary-General\r\nentitled \"An Agenda for Development\" (A/48/935) when it\r\ncites the economy as being the engine of progress and of\r\ndevelopment as a whole. If I may carry the metaphor a\r\nlittle further, it may be appropriate to say that at present the\r\nworld economy is a flawed engine that has stalled but is\r\nbeginning to warm up again. It is flawed by the\r\nimbalances and inequities that have distorted one of its\r\nmost important parts, the relationship between the\r\ndeveloped and the developing economies. It has broken\r\ndown in a long and devastating recession, but in recent\r\ntimes it has shown signs of recovery.\r\nHowever, the aggregate statistics of world economic\r\ngrowth often conceal as much as they reveal. As aptly put\r\nby the 1994 World Economic and Social Survey, the world\r\neconomy remains a complex mosaic of sharp contrasts, in\r\nwhich most developing countries are often too weak and\r\ntoo vulnerable to be able to compete successfully in the\r\nworld market, thus risking their further marginalization and\r\ndecline into extreme poverty. Hence, apart from the need\r\nto sustain non-inflationary, global economic growth, the\r\nurgent imperative continues to be the eradication of poverty\r\nand the acceleration of the socio-economic development of\r\nthe developing countries on a sustained and sustainable\r\nbasis.\r\nIf the engine for global progress and development is\r\nto carry mankind to a brighter future in the next century,\r\nthen its parts must be brought into a more balanced,\r\nsynergistic relationship and its functioning be made more\r\neffective and efficient. We have no alternative but to\r\nforge a new partnership for development involving all\r\nnations, developed and developing. It is therefore crucial\r\nthat we bring to full realization General Assembly\r\nresolution 48/165 on the \"Renewal of the dialogue on\r\nstrengthening international economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment through partnership\". By adopting this\r\nresolution, the international community has acknowledged\r\nthe indispensability of the principles of genuine\r\ninterdependence, of mutual interest and benefit, and of\r\nequitably shared responsibility, in a new spirit of global\r\npartnership.\r\nAs a necessary corollary to this North-South\r\npartnership, South-South cooperation has become even\r\nmore compelling, for the developing countries are called\r\nupon to shoulder an increasing share of the responsibility\r\nfor world growth and development. We look forward to\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on this issue and also\r\nto the deliberations leading to the adoption of \"An\r\nAgenda for Development\".\r\nAs many advocated during the World Hearings on\r\nDevelopment in June this year, as well as at the High-\r\nLevel Segment Meeting of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, the Agenda should be action-oriented and should\r\npresent an overall policy and priority framework for a\r\nbalanced and comprehensive approach to development.\r\nIt should reflect universal recognition and acceptance of\r\nthe United Nations as the only Organization capable of\r\ndealing with issues of development as well as with issues\r\nof peace and security. It will also be necessary for the\r\nagencies, bodies and programmes of the United Nations\r\nto be organized in such a way as to enable them to\r\nimplement the Agenda in an effective, efficient and\r\ncoordinated manner, without necessarily creating a new\r\nbody for this purpose. Obviously, there will be the need\r\nto generate the required political will in support of the\r\nAgenda. We look forward to seeing \"An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment\" serve as a fitting complement to \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\".\r\nOne of the most important recent developments in\r\nthe international economic sphere is the completion of the\r\nUruguay Round with the signing of its Final Act in\r\nMarrakesh and the agreement to establish the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO). Indonesia and the other\r\ndeveloping countries have accepted the Uruguay Round\r\npackage, in spite of the heavy obligations and challenges\r\nthat it entails, because they anticipate that considerable\r\nopportunities for increased market access and indeed for\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nworld economic growth and prosperity will now be\r\nforthcoming. They also expect that the Uruguay Round\r\npackage will provide the long-sought assurance of a\r\nrule-based and non-discriminatory multilateral trading\r\nsystem, free from the arbitrariness of unilateral action. Yet,\r\nwe must confess to being concerned at the possibility of a\r\ntardy and long-drawn-out process of implementing the Final\r\nAct. Such an eventuality will negate much of its original\r\nintent and rob it of its positive impact, as was, regrettably,\r\nthe experience with the Tokyo Round. Furthermore, the\r\nattempts to overload the WTO work programme with social\r\nclauses in our view represent protectionism in a thin guise\r\nand tend to nullify the few remaining comparative\r\nadvantages of developing countries. For this reason we feel\r\nstrongly that the process of ratification and implementation\r\nof the Uruguay Round agreements should not be linked to\r\nnew issues that have little or no relevance to the\r\ndevelopment of a new international trading regime. All\r\nnations are called upon to marshal their political will and to\r\naccept inevitable shifts in comparative advantage without\r\ntransferring the burden of adjustment to weaker economies.\r\nHad relationships between developed and developing\r\ncountries been more equitable, we would not today be faced\r\nwith the problem of developing countries staggering under\r\ntheir external debt burden. While aggregate debt indicators\r\nhave undoubtedly improved, mainly in response to various\r\ndebt-relief measures, the external debt crisis still persists\r\nespecially in the least developed countries where debt ratios\r\nhave significantly worsened and continue to hamper the\r\nprospects for economic growth and development. A\r\ndurable solution to the perennial debt question can only be\r\nsecured through a development-oriented strategy formulated\r\nwithin the framework of shared responsibility and genuine\r\npartnership. Thus, rather than taking a one-sided view of\r\nthe causes of external debt, there is an urgent need for all\r\nsides involved to adopt a coordinated approach.\r\nAs Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nIndonesia has given the highest priority to resolving this\r\ncrisis. President Soeharto took the initiative of conveying\r\na memorandum on the debt of developing countries to the\r\nChairman of the Group of Seven on the eve of their Tokyo\r\nSummit last year, inviting the G-7 to engage in dialogue on\r\nthis issue. We are encouraged that the G-7 responded\r\npositively to the Non-Aligned Movement on this issue in\r\nTokyo and then again last July in Naples, where, inter alia,\r\nit urged the Paris Club to pursue its efforts to improve the\r\ndebt treatment of the poorest and most indebted countries\r\nand, where appropriate, to reduce the stock of debt as well\r\nas to increase concessionality for those countries facing\r\nspecial difficulties. Moreover, Indonesia has also recently\r\nhosted a ministerial meeting of non-aligned countries on\r\ndebt and development, involving the most heavily\r\nindebted least developed countries. The meeting called\r\nupon the international community, particularly donors and\r\ninternational financial institutions, inter alia, to adopt a\r\ncommon set of principles for future debt negotiations,\r\nwhich include a once-and-for-all arrangement for settling\r\nall outstanding debts, and the application of debt\r\nreduction to all categories of debt, including multilateral\r\ndebts. A report of the meeting has been submitted to the\r\nSecretary-General for possible consideration at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nAs a firm believer in the rights of peoples to\r\ndevelopment, including social development, Indonesia is\r\ndeeply committed to participating actively in the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. The World Conference\r\non Women in 1995 equally deserves total support from\r\nthe international community. Indonesia is committed to\r\nthe adoption of a conference declaration calling for de\r\nfacto as well as de jure equality between men and\r\nwomen, the integration of gender concerns into\r\nsustainable development, and a programme of action to\r\nachieve those goals.\r\nAs we prepare ourselves to commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Organization next year, I sense that\r\ndespite the frustration of our hopes after the end of the\r\ncold war, we are about to open a window on a future that\r\ntruly does not belong to the nations of the North or the\r\nSouth, the West or the East, but to undivided humanity.\r\nPerhaps the advent of wisdom is always a gradual\r\nprocess. First we came to the realization that the human\r\nrace could not survive in a state of cold war against itself;\r\nthat our problems are global and systemic in nature, and\r\nthus that truly effective solutions to these problems should\r\nbe integral and so comprehensive they must be carried out\r\nby a global partnership.\r\nWithout that partnership, we should now realize, our\r\nbright hopes are unattainable. As we work to complete\r\n\"An Agenda for Development\" so as to match it with \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\", we are actually etching the fine\r\ndetails of our common vision of a better and more unified\r\nworld. It is said that the future belongs to those who\r\nhave a clear vision of it. That may be so, but only if we\r\nare faithful to that vision, persevere in its pursuit, and\r\nthereby prove ourselves worthy of it.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic\r\nof Georgia, His Excellency Mr. Alexander Chikvaidze.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nMr. Chikvaidze (Georgia): I should like to begin by\r\nextending my congratulations to Mr. Amara Essy on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\nninth session. It is a fitting acknowledgement of his\r\nconsiderable experience, as well as a tribute to his country’s\r\nhigh standing in the international community.\r\nI should also like to offer greetings and special words\r\nof gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for the attention and careful consideration he\r\nhas accorded to my country’s problems and for his selfless\r\ndevotion to the cause of securing a safer and saner world\r\nfor future generations. The Georgian people are looking\r\nforward with great anticipation to his forthcoming official\r\nvisit to Georgia.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to convey to the Assembly\r\nthe greetings and best wishes for productive work from the\r\nHead of State and Chairman of the Parliament of the\r\nRepublic of Georgia, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze.\r\nJust over two years have passed since the day I had\r\nthe privilege of ushering my country into the United\r\nNations as its one hundred seventy-ninth Member and\r\naddressing the Assembly from this rostrum. It was a\r\nmoment of joy and celebration for my nation.\r\nMany events have taken place in those two years, and\r\nthey certainly cannot serve as a basis for euphoria and\r\ncomplacency.\r\nMy country has only recently set out on the arduous\r\njourney of building a democratic society. It is encountering\r\nnumerous internal, as well as external, problems in its\r\nefforts. Despite fair and democratic elections and the\r\nforming of government structures, the country continues to\r\nlanguish in a deep economic and political crisis.\r\nThe international community has extended a helping\r\nhand to Georgia, and I should like to convey our\r\nappreciation and gratitude to the Governments of the United\r\nStates of America, the Russian Federation, Germany, other\r\nStates members of the European Union and Turkey, to\r\nname but a few, as well as to the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies, for their invaluable assistance to my\r\ncountry in times of hardship.\r\nGranted, a large measure of the problems facing\r\nGeorgia and all those nations which have only recently\r\nreverted to independence and normal development have\r\ndomestic roots and must be addressed, first and foremost,\r\nby the countries themselves. But let us leave the internal\r\naspect aside for the moment and concentrate on the\r\ninternational environment, of which these nations, as well\r\nas all other nations, are a part.\r\nWith the demise of the cold war the world\r\nunderwent profound changes. The risk of an all-out\r\nnuclear catastrophe receded, and the world thus became\r\na less dangerous place; but at the same time it became\r\nless stable and less predictable. The relationship between\r\nStates and other actors on the international scene has\r\nchanged, too.\r\nThe system of post-war international relations was\r\ntailored to the economic, political, ideological, geographic\r\nand other realities of that era. One of these realities was\r\na deep realization of the fact that a totalitarian regime of\r\nthe fascist variety had been defeated. Therefore, despite\r\nits major flaws, the post-war bipolar system generally\r\nresponded to the demands of the times and somehow\r\nensured security and stability on our planet.\r\nOur generation witnessed the fall of another\r\ntotalitarian regime with the downfall of communist\r\nideology and of its followers. This resulted in deep\r\nchanges in the nature of international relations. Different\r\ndemands are being dictated by the times and different\r\nchallenges are now facing the community of nations.\r\nThis end of a whole era of human history, however, was\r\nnot followed by the creation of a new system of\r\ninternational relations that would correspond to the\r\nrealities of the contemporary world, as happened some 50\r\nyears ago. International political institutions, as well as\r\npolitical thought in general, found themselves unprepared\r\nfor the changes, and they continue to apply stop-gap\r\nmeasures to this very day.\r\nToday’s political leaders seem to have\r\nunderestimated both the essence and the importance of\r\nthese changes; hence the inability to cope with today’s\r\nproblems or with the challenges of the\r\npost-confrontational world. The infrastructure, principles,\r\ntools and mentality of international relations need to be\r\nadapted to the changed circumstances.\r\nTherein lies the external aspect of the problems that\r\nthe newly emerging independent States, including my own\r\ncountry, are facing. They are taking their first unsure\r\nsteps on the road to a democratic society, a long and\r\ndifficult road in a world that is still reeling from the\r\nnature of the changes and that realizes neither the extent\r\nof the predicament these nations face nor the stake it has\r\nin their existence and stable development.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nMany of these nations, including my own, can,\r\nunfortunately, be described as \"hot spots\": they are the\r\nunhealed wounds that cover the body of our planet. These\r\nopen wounds cry out for radical surgery, while the\r\npeace-keeping activities of the international community,\r\ndespite its best efforts, tend in some cases to resemble\r\ncautious treatment with prescribed medication.\r\nPerhaps, as I am the Foreign Minister of Georgia, it is\r\nnot for me to complain about the deficiencies of the United\r\nNations in terms of its peace-keeping activities. The\r\nOrganization as a whole, its Security Council,\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and his Special\r\nEnvoy, Ambassador Brunner of Switzerland, have accorded\r\na great deal of attention to the problems of my tormented\r\ncountry. On the issue of Georgia’s Abkhazia region alone,\r\nnine Security Council resolutions have been adopted,\r\nnumerous missions have been dispatched and the mandate\r\nof the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia\r\n(UNOMIG) has been extended. Alas, this has not proved\r\nto be sufficient. Clear decisions and bold, timely action are\r\nwhat the peoples of the world expect of the United Nations\r\nand of the Member States that make up the Organization.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to note how useful and\r\ntimely the Georgian Government found the recent visit to\r\nGeorgia of the United States Permanent Representative to\r\nthe United Nations, Ambassador Madeleine Albright. That\r\nvisit also demonstrates the attention President Clinton\r\nattaches to events in Georgia.\r\nWhile I would not want to belabour the issue of \"hot\r\nspots,\" the predicament of my own country does not allow\r\nme to ignore this problem altogether. We would hate to\r\nthink that yet another experiment is perhaps being\r\nconducted in Georgia, the result of which may well have a\r\ndirect bearing on the security and sovereignty of other\r\nnations.\r\nIt is hard to describe the disappointment - and\r\nsometimes apathy - which the Georgian nation is feeling\r\nwith regard to whether the international community will be\r\nable to promote a peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian\r\nconflict.\r\nThese feelings have created a dangerous and volatile\r\npolitical situation domestically. A wave of indignation is\r\nrising in Parliament and among the people at the inability\r\nto resolve this conflict - and the efforts to do so have been\r\ngoing on for more than a year now - and allow almost\r\n300,000 displaced persons, who escaped physical\r\nextermination, to return to their homes and continue their\r\nlives.\r\nAt the heart of the Abkhazian conflict is an attempt\r\nby forces of aggressive separatism, bolstered by external\r\nsupport, to wrench a piece of territory away from a\r\nsovereign State and to create, in that part of Georgia, a\r\nprovincial dictatorship based on ethnic hatred, intolerance\r\nand discrimination.\r\nWe appealed to the United Nations in the hope that\r\nit would be responsive to our desire to settle the conflict\r\nby peaceful means through a United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operation. But our hopes were only\r\npartially fulfilled. Despite almost a dozen resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council, Member States could find neither\r\nthe financial resources, the military contingents nor the\r\npolitical will to order a peace-keeping operation in\r\nGeorgia.\r\nConvinced of the possibility of a fair solution under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations, the Georgian\r\nGovernment has been negotiating with the separatists in\r\ngood faith all this time under the auspices of the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, with the Russian\r\nFederation as facilitator and the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) as an observer. As a\r\nresult, a number of agreements have been signed, which\r\nare designed to promote the return of the displaced\r\npersons to their homes and a settlement of the conflict.\r\nBut the bitter memory of a string of broken promises\r\nand unfulfilled obligations on the part of the separatists\r\nconfirms how naive it is to expect a forthcoming position\r\nfrom a regime that conducts \"ethnic cleansing\" and\r\ngenocide against the Georgian population. Predictably,\r\nthe Abkhazian separatists are using far-fetched pretexts to\r\ncontinue ignoring their commitments under the\r\nagreements that have been signed.\r\nFrustrated in its hopes for a United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operation in Abkhazia, the Government of\r\nthe Republic of Georgia sent a similar appeal to the heads\r\nof the States members of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS). A decision was reached and a\r\nCIS peace-keeping force was deployed in the zone of\r\nconflict. While its presence is beneficial and provides\r\nhope for a settlement, we feel that it could be more active\r\nand proceed beyond the stage of disengaging the parties\r\nin conflict.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nThe Abkhazian conflict is not a problem for Georgia\r\nalone. Believe me, I am not saying this in order to lay our\r\nproblems at somebody else’s doorstep. This conflict has\r\ndirect and dangerous implications for the entire world.\r\nThere are also compelling reasons why the world should be\r\nconcerned with finding a solution to this problem.\r\nAbove all, we believe that the international community\r\nsimply cannot act as an outside observer when a blatant\r\nattempt is being made against the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of a Member State and when peace and stability\r\nare threatened. Allowing separatism to attain its goals in\r\none country would set a precedent that could start a chain\r\nreaction throughout the world. And how many of us\r\nrepresented here today can safely say that their countries,\r\ntheir peoples, are immune from this danger?\r\nAnd, lastly, the Caucasus is one of those areas in the\r\nworld which have a geopolitical importance and bearing on\r\nthe stability of large regions of the planet. The Caucasus\r\nis one of the world’s few crossroads where North, South,\r\nEast and West meet, and where continents, cultures,\r\ninterests and strategies encounter one another. If peace and\r\nstability cannot be maintained in the Caucasus, they cannot\r\nbe maintained anywhere.\r\nIn this regard, it is tragic that our closest neighbours,\r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan, have been unable to resolve their\r\ndifferences for so many years now. This conflict, too, tears\r\nat the fabric of the Caucasus and greatly increases the\r\ninstability of the region, as well as the misery of hundreds\r\nof thousands of people.\r\nIt is my Government’s firm position that the\r\nAbkhazian conflict can and should be resolved by peaceful\r\nmeans. A great deal of effort, delicate statesmanship and\r\ndeep commitment are required from all sides.\r\nThe Georgian Government has to be very meticulous\r\nin elaborating a modern, workable and fair structure for its\r\nethnically and culturally diverse population, a diversity\r\nwhich throughout the centuries has been a source of\r\nfriendship, stability and pride, and never of tension or\r\nhatred. Most important, it has to create a strong economic\r\nbase for its people, one that would prevent economic\r\nhardships from taking on a political and ethnic character.\r\nGeorgia will never accept the loss of any part of its\r\nterritory. Not only because its territory is not large, but\r\nalso because what it has is incontestably its own - every\r\nsquare inch of it. The leaders of the Abkhazian separatists\r\nhave to realize this. They too have to find the political\r\ncourage and will, the flexibility and the foresight, to\r\nnegotiate in good faith and come to a settlement that\r\nwould be fair and lasting, so that future generations of\r\nGeorgians and Abkhazians could forget this one dark\r\npage in their fathers’ lives and pick up in friendship and\r\npeace where their grandfathers left off.\r\nThe Russian Federation is an active participant in the\r\nprocess designed to find a peaceful solution to the\r\nAbkhazian conflict. It has taken on a great responsibility\r\nwith regard to this peace process. We firmly believe that,\r\ndespite the feelings of some political groups, the Russian\r\nFederation, as a great Power - and President Yeltsin, as\r\nthe leader of that nation - does indeed want to see a\r\nstrong, stable, sovereign, united and friendly Georgia on\r\nits southern border. Any other considerations would be\r\ncontrary to logic. We are gratified that in his address to\r\nthis Assembly a few days ago President Yeltsin alluded\r\nto this when he said that Russia’s relations towards other\r\nStates members of the Commonwealth of Independent\r\nStates are based on good will and mutual benefit. In\r\nshort, it is a time to think not about the mistakes of the\r\npast, but about the possibilities for the future.\r\nGeorgia has only recently joined the community of\r\nnations as a full-fledged member. And yet this period has\r\nbeen filled with events of great intensity and emotion for\r\nus. We feel an obligation to share our experience and\r\nthoughts in a number of areas which, we believe, will\r\ncontribute to the effectiveness of our collective efforts in\r\nthe future.\r\nWe live in troubled times and are witness to rapid,\r\nunpredictable changes in the world. It is of paramount\r\nimportance that contemporary political thought bring\r\nexisting international institutions into conformity with the\r\ninternational political realities of today. It would seem\r\nthat even such a representative body as the United\r\nNations, if it is to continue to be ahead of events and\r\nfulfil its role as the parliament of man in a new situation,\r\nmay have to effect some changes in its structure.\r\nThe reforms - prompted by the times - which the\r\nOrganization is about to embark upon, the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General to implement them, and the consent of\r\nthe majority of the Member States are evidence that the\r\ntime has come for a new era in international relations.\r\nThe number of Member States has more than\r\ndoubled since the creation of the United Nations. We\r\nfully support the proposal to reflect these changes by\r\nincreasing the numerical composition of the Security\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nCouncil to 21, and we believe that the candidacies of\r\nGermany and Japan are appropriate for inclusion as new\r\npermanent members of the enlarged Security Council.\r\nApart from reflecting the political and economic weight of\r\nthese nations, this would also enable us finally to bring to\r\na close the legacy of the Second World War and the cold\r\nwar.\r\nIn considering the possibilities for increasing the\r\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members of the\r\nCouncil, one of the main criteria, in our view, should be the\r\ninvolvement and role of member States in maintaining\r\nuniversal peace and stability. Although we see this\r\nconsideration as a crucial one, other aspects, such as\r\nequitable geographical representation, should not be\r\nneglected either.\r\nThe task of creating a modern comprehensive system\r\nof ensuring peace and security in the world requires an\r\nincrease in the effectiveness of the International Court of\r\nJustice, the main judicial body of the United Nations. We\r\nshare the concern of the Secretary-General that the Court,\r\nthe most important instrument for the settlement of\r\ndisputes, is not being fully utilized for this purpose. More\r\nefficient use of the International Court would, undoubtedly,\r\nreinforce the ability of the United Nations to promote and\r\nstrengthen peace. In this regard, we fully support the\r\ninitiative of the Secretary-General to recognize the universal\r\njurisdiction of the International Court, in accordance with\r\nArticle 36 of its Statute, and on the basis of the\r\nrecommendations put forward in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277).\r\nEfforts aimed at creating a comprehensive system of\r\ninternational security can be effective today only if they are\r\napplied at both the global and the regional level. In our\r\nview, the ties between the global and regional security\r\nsystems are inadequate for today’s needs, and are\r\nmaintained in a haphazard way. In this regard we consider\r\nit timely to raise the issue of achieving a higher level of\r\ninteraction between global and regional security systems by\r\nconcluding a series of special \"form\" treaties that will\r\nensure more effective use, in close coordination, of their\r\nrespective mechanisms.\r\nWithout prejudice to United Nations rules and\r\nregulations and to the provisions of the Charter, or to the\r\nstatutes of the regional systems, these treaties should\r\nprovide, inter alia, for regional organizations to exercise\r\nconsultative and controlling functions on behalf, and on the\r\nauthorization, of the United Nations.\r\nIn various international forums we often discuss the\r\nspecific challenges of the post-confrontational world.\r\nSeparatism, especially in its aggressive, extremist form, is\r\none of the most dangerous of these challenges, and it is\r\nspreading like a cancer all over the planet. We believe\r\nthat the creation of a legal basis for the containment of\r\naggressive separatism is imperative and long overdue so\r\nthat situations, such as the one in Georgia, will not flare\r\nup in other parts of the world in future, or if they do, they\r\nwill be localized and defused in a timely manner.\r\nWe propose that clear provisions be inserted into\r\ninternational legal documents, outlawing aggressive,\r\nextremist separatism from its first stirrings. It is\r\nbecoming more and more clear that the mere reiteration\r\nand confirmation of the principle of territorial integrity\r\nand the inviolability of borders is insufficient, all the\r\nmore so since it is being flagrantly disregarded in many\r\ninstances.\r\nThese legal provisions should also envisage a strict\r\nembargo on military deliveries and swift, surgical\r\neconomic measures against separatist movements that\r\nhave turned to armed struggle and violence, as well as a\r\nmechanism to use, in exceptional cases, the most decisive\r\nmeasure - military force.\r\nThe military forces for these operations could be set\r\nup in one of two ways: either United Nations stand-by\r\nforces, an option which would entail considerable\r\nfinancial expense, or special well-trained units within the\r\narmed forces of each Member State which, when needed,\r\ncould be put under the direct command of the United\r\nNations Military Staff Committee, which itself could\r\nbecome more active and energetic.\r\nWhile the second option seems more realistic at\r\npresent, I would still like to stress the virtues of early\r\npreventive measures against such conflicts. Perhaps many\r\nof them could be localized and defused at an early stage,\r\nif the United Nations had relatively small, mobile forces\r\nof rapid reaction and deployment at its disposal. These\r\nforces could be made up on an international voluntary\r\nbasis, thereby emphasizing their impartial and unbiased\r\nnature. They could be rapidly deployed in the conflict\r\nzone and, acting within a limited mandate, could ensure\r\nthe disengagement of the conflicting parties in order to\r\ncreate the conditions for the deployment of a United\r\nNations peace-keeping force.\r\nIn this regard, it would also seem indispensable to us\r\nto set up a special department within the United Nations\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nSecretariat the sole purpose of which would be to work to\r\nresolve conflict situations. Ten highly experienced and\r\nrespected political figures could form the nucleus of such\r\na department. To perform their functions they would be\r\nvested with special rights and obligations.\r\nWithin such a department a special unit could be set\r\nup to coordinate the actions of the rapid deployment force.\r\nIt would ensure the collection of information and\r\nintelligence data, and generally function as operations\r\nheadquarters. The unit could also provide valuable\r\nearly-warning information on potential conflict situations\r\ninvolving separatist tendencies.\r\nTo anticipate a natural question on the financing of\r\nsuch forces, I should say that, yes, it will undoubtedly\r\nentail additional financial, material means and human\r\nresources. This, however, is a case of the end clearly\r\njustifying the means. As we have paid a far greater price\r\nfor being late so often in the past, the international\r\ncommunity can no longer afford such a luxury.\r\nA few days ago a proposal was made very forcefully\r\nfrom this rostrum that, in order to safeguard and uphold the\r\nrights of national minorities, the principles of the\r\nDeclaration on the rights of national minorities should be\r\nembodied in the legislation of all member States. We\r\nfirmly support the principle of providing national minorities\r\nwith wide political, economic and cultural rights, and of\r\nensuring civil and human rights for everyone. We would\r\nthus like to go a step further and propose to codify all\r\naspects of this issue.\r\nSince every right presumes a responsibility, we believe\r\nthat it is imperative that international legal documents and\r\nnational legislations of Member States, along with the rights\r\nof national minorities, also incorporate provisions on the\r\nresponsibilities of these minorities towards the country of\r\nwhich they form a part.\r\nIn view of the rapidly growing role of individual\r\nleaders and personalities in international relations today, it\r\nwould seem appropriate to us to consider also the issue of\r\nresponsibility for an individual’s role in the violation of\r\nhuman rights and liberties of persons, or groups of persons.\r\nThus, we fully support the proposal to work out a\r\ndeclaration on the rights and responsibilities of individuals,\r\ngroups and political bodies to ensure commonly accepted\r\nfreedoms and human rights. It is precisely in this context\r\nthat Georgia supported the creation of the post of United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nI have attempted to outline some of my\r\nGovernment’s thoughts with regard to the changes that it\r\nthinks should be made in the structure and work of the\r\nOrganization in view of the many profound changes in\r\nthe international landscape today. While these are just\r\nsome elements, a comprehensive and balanced vision of\r\nthe needed changes is laid out by the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in \"An Agenda for Peace\" and\r\nother documents. The implementation of the changes\r\nwould go a long way towards eliminating many of the\r\nproblems that we are discussing in this Hall and would\r\nalso represent, as Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze put it so\r\naptly, a very timely \"blood transfusion\" for the entire\r\ninternational system.\r\nAn important period is approaching in the life of the\r\nOrganization. Next year we will be commemorating the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\r\nWe have reached a mature age which allows us to take\r\nstock of the Organization’s many accomplishments, but\r\nalso one that obliges us to look ahead to what still needs\r\nto be done.\r\nA half century of existence and experience confers\r\neven greater responsibility upon the Organization, as well\r\nas upon individual Member States. It imposes grander\r\nobjectives, but also opens up wider horizons. Some of\r\nthese objectives can be attained in our lifetime, while\r\nothers will be left to succeeding generations. It is our\r\nresponsibility to provide a legacy which will serve as a\r\nstepping-stone for mankind to make a leap into the\r\ntwenty-first century and land softly on solid ground.\r\nGeorgia is a small country, but it is a democratic\r\ncountry, and its foreign-policy objective is to have\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\npeaceful, friendly relations with all the nations of the world.\r\nGeorgia will not be a passive observer of international\r\nevents; it will carry its fair share of the responsibilities of\r\nthe international community and make its contribution to\r\nachieving our common goals.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.40 p.m.\r\n29\r\n"
