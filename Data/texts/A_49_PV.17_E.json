(Coté d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.25 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, President of the\r\nRepublic of Haiti\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Haiti.\r\nMr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, President of the Republic\r\nof Haiti, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Haiti, His Excellency Mr. Jean-Bertrand\r\nAristide, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Aristide (interpretation from French): It\r\ngives me great pleasure to greet all of you here, on behalf\r\nof the Haitian people and, with a sense of joy, to address\r\nthe most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Amara Essy,\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire, on his election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. Mr. President, as I wish you every measure of\r\nsuccess, I wish to make a point of assuring you of the\r\nfullest cooperation of the delegation of Haiti.\r\nTo Ambassador Samuel Insanally, I address my\r\ncompliments for having so masterfully guided the work of\r\nthe Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nOur congratulations and appreciation also go to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. I thank\r\nhim with all my heart for the ties of solidarity he has\r\nwoven with the Haitian people.\r\nTo all my dear friends throughout the international\r\ncommunity, I address my heartfelt thanks for the support\r\nthey have given the Haitian people throughout these last\r\nthree years.\r\nAllow me to address a word of special appreciation\r\nto President Bill Clinton, to our special friends the United\r\nStates, Canada, France, Venezuela, Argentina and to all\r\nthe States, especially those of the Caribbean Community\r\nand common market (CARICOM), that have contributed\r\nto the implementation of Security Council resolution\r\n940 (1994) and of the Governors Island Agreement. How\r\nhappy I am to salute all of you and to thank you\r\nlavalassly.\r\nIn 11 days I shall be in Haiti - at last. Thanks to the\r\nheroic courage of the Haitian people and thanks to your\r\nsolidarity, we will soon be back. Your eyes and our own\r\nwill contemplate the opening of the flowers of\r\ndemocracy. In eleven days I shall invite you to celebrate\r\nthis festival of reconciliation, of democracy and of peace\r\nat home, in Haiti.\r\nEven now, with the peaceful launching of the\r\noperation \"Uphold Democracy\" on 19 September last, a\r\ntropical smile has shed light upon the faces of those who\r\nespouse and love peace. Together, President Clinton and\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nwe have managed to open up a channel of hope after so\r\nmuch suffering.\r\n(spoke in Creole; interpretation from French text furnished\r\nby the delegation)\r\nMy hat is off to the Haitian people.\r\nHonour and respect to the 5,000 victims among us.\r\nFather Jean-Marie Vincent died so that Haiti could\r\nlive.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe resistance of the Haitian people has its roots in a\r\nhistorical past where the beacon of liberty has shone day\r\nand night. As he was being put on a ship for France,\r\nToussaint Louverture declared quite rightly,\r\n\"In overthrowing me, you have only cut down\r\nthe trunk of the tree of liberty. Its roots will grow\r\nback, for they are many and deep.\"\r\nOn the threshold of the bicentennial of our\r\nindependence, these roots nourish us with the sap of\r\ndemocracy. The Haitian people will never cease in its\r\nstruggle to guarantee its inalienable and imprescriptible\r\nrights to life, liberty and happiness. We will never cease in\r\nthe struggle to establish a socially just, economically free\r\nand politically independent Haitian nation.\r\nThus, the first black republic of the world, today torn\r\nasunder by the coup d’état of 30 September 1991, is\r\nmarching resolutely and definitively towards the\r\nestablishment of a democratic society.\r\n(spoke in Creole; interpretation from French text furnished\r\nby the delegation)\r\nThrough diplomacy\r\nWe attain democracy.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn the face of this grim tragedy that has meant three\r\nyears of suffering, thorns of pain pierce our hearts. None\r\nthe less, our people excels at colouring the landscape with\r\nhope.\r\nThe brave live in hope\r\nand the cowardly in fear.\r\nBetter late than never: \"By following the river you\r\nreach the sea\", said Plautus as long ago as the second\r\ncentury B.C. To this end, despite the democratic\r\nstructures set up by Solon and Pittacus in the sixth\r\ncentury B.C., it was necessary to wait for Ephialtes,\r\nCleisthenes and Pericles to achieve the democratization of\r\npolitical life in Athens.\r\n(spoke in Creole; interpretation from French text\r\nfurnished by the delegation)\r\nHope gives life.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe have no fear of the Haiti of the year 2004.\r\nDespite the dreadful spectacle of the last three years,\r\nwe march towards the year 2004 with optimism. The\r\npath that leads there necessarily passes through the\r\nhistoric crossroads where the elections of 16 December\r\n1990 and our return to Haiti meet.\r\nEleven days from now I shall be there, thanks to the\r\ndetermination of the Haitian people and to your solidarity.\r\nThis is a history worthy of attention, and there is no\r\nhistory worthy of attention other than that of free peoples.\r\nThe history of peoples subjugated to despotism is no\r\nmore than a collection of anecdotes.\r\nEleven days from now we shall be there. A brilliant\r\nlight, that of reconciliation, will dazzle us. Between\r\nviolence and vengeance, reconciliation steps in. Between\r\nimpunity and iniquity, justice steps in. In other words,\r\nwe the President of the Republic of Haiti clearly and\r\nfirmly say,\r\nYes to reconciliation!\r\nNo to violence!\r\nNo to vengeance!\r\nNo to impunity!\r\nYes to justice!\r\n(spoke in Creole; interpretation from French text\r\nfurnished by the delegation)\r\nWe shall brew a coffee of reconciliation\r\nthrough the filter of justice\r\nso that no trace of violence, no vengeance\r\nwill be found.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWith reconciliation, all hearts - rich and poor, civilian\r\nand soldier - must be embraced by enthusiasm. With\r\nreconciliation, our proud eyes must no longer be flooded\r\nwith tears.\r\nYou, parents and friends of our 5,000 victims,\r\nyou who endure this crushing yoke,\r\nall of you, rich and poor, soldier and civilian:\r\nsoon a stream of light will flood\r\nthe deepest wells of your heart.\r\nSurely it is the light of reconciliation.\r\nOtherwise, how can we dispel the gloom of subhuman\r\nabjectness? How can we pass from wretchedness to\r\npoverty in dignity?\r\nA study of the countries of the third world shows us\r\nthat 20 per cent of the population in developing countries\r\nknow hunger every day, 25 per cent are deprived of the\r\nessential means of survival, 33 per cent languish in abject\r\npoverty. The World Summit for Social Development, to be\r\nheld in Copenhagen in 1995, must offer new possibilities\r\nfor alleviating the distress of more than a billion human\r\nbeings preyed upon by hunger, disease and utter\r\nhelplessness.\r\nIn Haiti in 1994, 750,000 children attend school; more\r\nthan 1,250,000 stay at home or work plots of land. Yet our\r\nConstitution stipulates that education is a right of all\r\ncitizens. It is a duty the State cannot shirk. In these\r\ncircumstances, 10 years from now we will have to attend to\r\n3,000,000 school-aged children, which will mean increasing\r\nthe number of teachers from 35,000 to 100,000 and the\r\nnumber of schools from 8,000 to 20,000.\r\nOn our return we shall undertake a literacy campaign\r\nmaking it possible to attain a significantly low rate of\r\nilliteracy: 5 to 10 per cent. Reconciliation among all is of\r\ncourse imperative. Everywhere and always, reconciliation\r\nand peace are intertwined.\r\nThe dissolution of the Soviet bloc has favoured the\r\nopening of a new era after decades of bipolarization. Yet\r\nwe have the responsibility of protecting peace within our\r\nown States. Between 1989 and 1992 there were 82 armed\r\nconflicts, only three of which were between States.\r\nIn our country, institutionalized violence did not\r\nunleash a civil war but, rather, a genocide. Even today,\r\ndespite the presence of the multinational force, acts of\r\nviolence against our population continue. The disarming\r\nof paramilitary groups, notably FRAPH and its attachés,\r\nis indispensable if peace is to reign throughout our\r\ncountry.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThis operation is proceeding to the complete\r\nsatisfaction of the Haitian people. Obviously, the\r\nrestoration of democracy will bring reconciliation for all,\r\npeace to all of us and respect and justice to every single\r\ncitizen.\r\n(spoke in Creole; interpretation from French text\r\nfurnished by the delegation)\r\nLavalas brings a message of peace.\r\nThe guns must fall silent\r\nif we are to have peace.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe professionalization of a 1,500-strong army and\r\nthe creation of a police force that is separate from the\r\narmy fall within this peace process. Peace must be\r\nprotected and guaranteed for the sake of the happiness of\r\nall Haitian men and women.\r\nArticle 265 of our Constitution stipulates: \"The\r\nArmed Forces of Haiti are apolitical\". Article 264 says:\r\n\"They are set up to guarantee the security and territorial\r\nintegrity of the Republic\".\r\nArticle 269-1 says:\r\n\"The Police must ensure the maintenance of public\r\norder and the protection of the lives and the property\r\nof the citizenry\".\r\nIt is time to create a stable environment that will\r\nmake national reconciliation possible in our land. We\r\nshall no longer have an army of 7,000 absorbing 40 per\r\ncent of the national budget. Globally speaking, military\r\nexpenditures have declined considerably over the last six\r\nyears, at an average rate of 3.6 per cent per annum.\r\nWhy, then, do we have one soldier for every 1,000\r\nHaitians and 1.8 physicians for every 10,000 inhabitants,\r\nwhile the industrial countries average one physician for\r\nevery 400 inhabitants?\r\nOnce back home, we shall set in motion our\r\nprogramme to correct the current health situation where\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nthere are 1,000 physicians for 7 million inhabitants, one\r\nnurse for every 2,200 inhabitants, and one hospital bed for\r\nevery 1,300 inhabitants. Our goal is to care for 8 million\r\nHaitians with 2,000 physicians and 8,000 nurses and to\r\nincrease the number of hospital beds to one for every 400\r\ninhabitants by the year 2004. We will have to open a\r\nhealth centre in every district; we shall then have 52. Each\r\nmunicipal area will have its own dispensary. The measures\r\nto be adopted will allow us to reduce the infant mortality\r\nrate from 135 to 40 per 1,000. The average life expectancy\r\nof our population will rise from 54 to 65 years.\r\nReconciliation and reconstruction are intimately\r\nintertwined:\r\n(spoke in Creole; interpretation from French text furnished\r\nby the delegation)\r\nWe shall prepare the coffee of reconciliation in the\r\nfilter of justice so that we shall no longer find any trace of\r\nviolence or vengeance.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAbove and beyond our national boundaries, the\r\ntragedies of Rwanda, Burundi and Bosnia-Herzegovina have\r\nconfronted us day after day. The suffering of one man is\r\nthe suffering of mankind. Every person represents\r\nhumanity. Since the end of the Second World War, over\r\n23 million people have been killed in armed conflict. How\r\ncan one remain indifferent when confronted by the tempests\r\nof violence that have scourged so many countries with\r\nwhich we enjoy fraternal ties, such as Liberia, Somalia,\r\nGeorgia, the Sudan and Armenia, to cite just a few?\r\nFortunately, certain conflicts have taken a turn towards\r\npeace in the course of the last two years. We hail with\r\nhope the peace between Israel and Palestine that has begun\r\nto emerge in the Middle East, and we likewise salute South\r\nAfrica, where the first non-racial, free elections have been\r\nheld.\r\nNeither racial barriers nor barriers of class must exist.\r\nOn the threshold of the year 2004, the Haitian diaspora -\r\nour tenth Département, as it were - is our focus par\r\nexcellence for celebration of the reconciliation between\r\nHaitians and Haiti.\r\n(spoke in Creole; interpretation from French text furnished\r\nby the delegation)\r\nBravo for our tenth Département. Haiti is the\r\nHaitians’ greatest wealth. Haiti always will be our \"chez\r\nnous\", our home. Come back home. We can make our\r\nhomeland as beautiful as a rainbow.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAt the present time 17.4 per cent - 740 kilometres -\r\nof our roads are paved; the remaining 2,960 kilometres\r\nare mud roads. Ten years hence, a network of some\r\n2,500 kilometres of paved roads will link all of our major\r\nand secondary cities and towns. Some 3,000 kilometres\r\nof local roads will be laid down.\r\nIn 1994, only 1.3 per cent of our forest cover\r\nremains. At this rate there will be no forests in Haiti by\r\n1998. With the major reforestation drive that we are\r\ngoing to set up, over 6 million trees will be planted each\r\nyear. By the year 2004, one-third of our territory will be\r\nreafforested.\r\nIt goes without saying that a climate of political\r\nstability will allow us to promote economic growth. In\r\n1991, the economic policy and fiscal discipline adopted\r\nby the Lavalas government brought in $500,200,000 in\r\ncustoms revenue, domestic revenue and transfers from\r\npublic enterprises. It was a historic performance for our\r\ncountry. By the year 2004, at a growth rate of 10 per\r\ncent per annum, the same revenue would bring in $1.26\r\nbillion.\r\nIn monetary terms, the results were just as\r\nsatisfactory: an increase in foreign exchange reserves of\r\n$20 million dollars; a decrease in the devaluation of our\r\ngourde, the national currency, from 58.8 to 47.6 per cent;\r\ninflation reduced from 20 to 12 per cent.\r\nBut what remains of these achievements after three\r\nyears of plunder? The debt ceiling has been raised twice.\r\nInflation is estimated at 60 per cent. Our national\r\ncurrency, the gourde, has been devalued by 300 per cent\r\nrelative to the dollar. Public finances are in bankruptcy\r\nand the public treasury has recorded a $100 million loss\r\nfor the fiscal years 1992-1994.\r\nThis is why there is an absolute need for this\r\nreconciliation between Haitians and Haiti, which is a sine\r\nqua non for creating a modern State by rebuilding the\r\neconomy. We have to open up the economy to attract\r\nforeign investment and to provide goods at better prices\r\nto Haitian consumers. Synergistic relationships between\r\nthe private sector and the State are indispensable.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nAt the level of developing countries, foreign debt has\r\nmultiplied fifteenfold in two decades. From $100 billion in\r\n1970, it rose to $650 billion in 1980 and to more than $1.5\r\ntrillion in 1992. This debt is an enormous brake on the\r\ndevelopment of third-world countries. In 1992 these\r\ncountries had to shoulder debt servicing of $160 billion:\r\nmore than twice the amount of official development\r\nassistance. However, one can see signs of a turn around.\r\nIn Haiti, back home, payments arrears rose to $42 million\r\nin September 1993 and will surpass $81 million in\r\nDecember of this year. After I return, $13 million will be\r\nfreed up as the government’s contribution to the reduction\r\nof these arrears.\r\nSetting up a State based on the rule of law also\r\nimplies reconciliation between Haitians and Haitians:\r\ncitizens of a country where every man and every woman is\r\na human being, equal before the law. The administration\r\nof real justice will free us from the vicious circle of\r\nviolence and vengeance. Today, the people of Haiti have\r\nno access to a system of justice. For our 565 municipal\r\nareas, there are only 170 courts and 300 attorneys.\r\nHowever, the rule of law remains an indispensable tool for\r\nbuilding the kind of world we aspire to by the year 2004.\r\nBetween now and then, each and every one of our\r\ncommunal areas will have to get its own court. The\r\nnumber of attorneys will double to 600. A reformed\r\njudicial system, backed by an independent, national, civilian\r\npolice force 10,000 strong, will restore confidence to our\r\ncitizens. Thus, the restoration of democracy will bring\r\nabout respect and justice for everyone.\r\nIn the year 2004, after 10 years of sound democratic\r\nmanagement, we shall have achieved a structured civil\r\nsociety where the bread of tolerance will be shared among\r\npolitical parties, the parliament, elected local officials, trade\r\nunions, socio-professional organizations, women on the\r\nfarms, grassroots organizations, religious and ecclesiastical\r\ngroups and communities - Protestants, Catholics and\r\npractitioners of voodoo alike - cooperatives, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, and so forth.\r\nOn the threshold of the third millennium, the principle\r\nof \"One man, one vote\" can only accelerate the form and\r\nmovement of democracy globally. From one-half to three-\r\nquarters of the world’s population lives under relatively\r\npluralistic and democratic systems of government. In 1993,\r\nelections were organized in 45 different countries,\r\nsometimes for the very first time.\r\nIn Haiti in 2004, we shall already have held four\r\nmunicipal elections, six legislative elections and three\r\npresidential ones. Public administration will already have\r\nbeen strengthened by the modernization of ministries and\r\npublic institutions. Political life will be more active at the\r\nlocal level because most of the major decisions will be\r\ntaken at the level of the 565 municipal areas and the 135\r\nmunicipalities.\r\nMr. President, distinguished diplomats and dear\r\nfriends in the international community, thanks to your\r\nsupport and the determination of the Haitian people, we\r\nshall soon see that brighter tomorrow.\r\nCreated to spare the world from the scourge of a\r\nnew world war, the United Nations has, over the years,\r\nseen its role expand and its responsibilities take on ever\r\nincreasing importance in a totally changed international\r\nsetting. As we gather here for this forty-ninth session, on\r\nthe eve of the commemoration of the United Nations\r\nfiftieth anniversary, I would voice the hope that the\r\nOrganization may always respond effectively to the new\r\nchallenges the world will proffer.\r\nTo the people of Haiti, the children of Haiti, the\r\nsource of our pride and our dignity, I say \"To save our\r\nbeloved Haiti, let us all be united beneath that spreading\r\npalm, topped with the crown of freedom, the shadow of\r\nwhose fronds protects those words inscribed in golden\r\nletters: ’Unity is strength.’\"\r\nOur universe is expanding. The hundred billion\r\ngalaxies of which it is composed are speeding farther and\r\nfarther apart while we Haitians, men and women, are\r\nmoving closer and closer together. Our slogan is:\r\n\"Reconciliation of one and all and justice for all.\"\r\nIn its elliptical orbit around the Sun the Earth moves\r\nat 30 kilometres a second. May the land of Haiti revolve\r\naround the sun of justice at like speed.\r\nWe are all present at this rendezvous of\r\nreconciliation, setting forth together towards the year\r\n2004, the bicentenary of our independence. I say:\r\n(spoke in Creole; interpretation from French text\r\nfurnished by the delegation)\r\n\"Spread the word among you, without violence\r\nor vengeance. Let us triumph through gentle\r\ndemocracy. I count on you, and you can count on\r\nme. For now, farewell - soon we will meet again.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\n\"Alone, we are weak. Together, we are strong.\r\nUnited we are Lavalas.\"\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, President of the Republic\r\nof Haiti, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral Debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Alberto Wahnon de\r\nCarvalho Veiga, Prime Minister and Minister of\r\nDefence of the Republic of Cape Verde\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime Minister\r\nand Minister of Defence of the Republic of Cape Verde.\r\nMr. Carlos Alberto Wahnon de Carvalho Veiga, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister of Defence of the Republic of\r\nCape Verde, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister of Defence of the Republic of Cape Verde, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Carlos Alberto Wahnon de Carvalho Veiga,\r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Veiga (Cape Verde) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\ninterpretation from French text furnished by the\r\ndelegation): Mr. President, we welcome with great\r\nsatisfaction your election to preside over the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly in the certainty that your\r\nqualities as an outstanding and experienced diplomat, in\r\naddition to your well-known personal dedication, will\r\nguarantee that our work is fruitful and effective. Through\r\nyou, your country and all of Africa will have the well-\r\ndeserved opportunity to contribute to the deliberations that\r\nlie before us.\r\nWe should like to express our gratitude to your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Insanally, for the able manner and\r\nconstructive spirit in which he guided the forty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nWe should also like to express to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral our appreciation for the far-sightedness with\r\nwhich he is performing the task of guiding the United\r\nNations in the new era into which it has entered.\r\nIn recent years there has been broad agreement that\r\nthe great events that have shaken the world, giving rise to\r\ngreat hopes of human progress, have led to different and\r\nin many respects contradictory changes and prospects, and\r\nthat there has been a delay in forging a genuine consensus\r\namong nations.\r\nDemocracy as a way of life has been established in\r\na large number of countries in every geographical area\r\nand is developing with obvious dynamism. We hope for\r\na kind of rebirth, inspired by an ever-greater participation\r\nin the whole social fabric of national life. In this\r\nframework, the civic aspect is coming to the fore and\r\ntaking on increasing vigour.\r\nLong deemed indispensable to economic progress,\r\nprivate enterprise has seen its role considerably increased\r\nin many developing countries.\r\nUnquestionably, there is an increased general\r\nawareness of the environment throughout the world, and\r\nthe idea that the value of the planet’s resources must\r\nendure as a condition of our very survival is gradually\r\nbecoming a guide and a criterion for human activities.\r\nInternational action to combat violations of human rights\r\nin all forms and to encourage the exercise of those rights\r\nhas become a constant, despite the distance separating us\r\nfrom the attainment of our desired objectives. The\r\nrejection of the social inequality of women is gaining\r\nground, and we shall from now on be discussing the way\r\nthis is reflected in practice.\r\nThose are the salient factors, in addition to others of\r\nequal importance, that are among the positive trends\r\nwhich are at our disposal and which must be developed\r\nat all costs so that we can derive the full benefit of their\r\ngreat potential.\r\nHowever, in the two major areas that constitute\r\nyardsticks for assessing mankind’s well-being - those of\r\npeace and development - the present situation is far from\r\nsatisfactory. Conflicts continue to proliferate, and\r\npositive settlements have been achieved to very few of\r\nthem. Situations of poverty have assumed vast\r\nproportions and even critical levels in several regions,\r\nparticularly in Africa. The persistence of these evils in\r\nthe post-cold-war era reminds us that the community of\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nnations still lacks a direction that might lead it towards the\r\nfulfilment of its own concept of genuine community. There\r\nhas been a lack of vision to recognize the true scope of\r\ncollective interests and the political will and ability to\r\nimplement them. There has also been a lack of cooperation\r\nand tolerance as independent values untouched by the\r\nsystematic quest for the upper hand.\r\nPeace and development are closely linked. Moreover,\r\nwe are convinced that the most complex challenge concerns\r\ndevelopment and that the most decisive influences on the\r\nrelationship arise from that challenge. Indeed, collective\r\nsecurity hinges on shared progress - shared within a\r\nframework that provides justice and equality. It is a fact\r\nthat during periods of expanded economic growth the most\r\nvisible effects of imbalance have, for better or for worse,\r\nbeen attenuated. However, the development to which we\r\naspire cannot be limited by narrow so-called realism.\r\nEquality as an inherent element of progress cannot be\r\ndescribed as an ideal today. It is, rather, a prerequisite.\r\nThe United Nations shouldered a very specific\r\nresponsibility and role when, in its Charter, it solemnly\r\ncommitted itself to working towards a better world. The\r\nUnited Nations is a unique body and its indispensability in\r\nserving the interests of all is becoming ever clearer today.\r\nIt is indeed in this universal forum that there is a need\r\njointly to establish guidelines for the entire world, that the\r\nrandom developments we experience converge, and that\r\nmechanisms and measures commensurate with today’s\r\nissues are promoted.\r\nIn order to increase its ability to carry out its mission\r\nin the present context, the United Nations has decided to\r\nreform its structure to make it more effective and stronger\r\nand to ensure greater participation: Under the dynamic and\r\ntireless coordination of the Secretary-General, the process\r\nis under way and we hope that at the present session of the\r\nAssembly new and fruitful progress will be achieved\r\nallowing the Organization further to promote economic and\r\nsocial development, prevent conflicts and eliminate their\r\ncauses. In this regard, the Assembly will continue to make\r\nuse of the guidelines set down in its \"Agenda for Peace\"\r\nand will have the opportunity to evaluate the report\r\ncontaining the draft of an Agenda for Development.\r\nThe strengthening of the legitimacy and authority of\r\nthe United Nations will remain linked to an improvement\r\nof its democratic representativeness and to better regional\r\nbalance, as well as to safeguarding the identity of all,\r\nincluding that of smaller States. In this context, Africa has\r\nrecently formulated its current position on the reform of the\r\nOrganization. This reform must provide genuine political\r\nand operational consistency to all the bodies and\r\nstructures of the system, within whose framework the\r\nAfrican continent must have an appropriately expanded\r\nrepresentation.\r\nIn the meantime, the question of the expansion of\r\nthe Security Council has been answered by some States\r\nwith expressions of their readiness to assume increased\r\nresponsibilities within it. As to the diversification of\r\nregional representation, we note with satisfaction and\r\nwelcome with great fellow-feeling the announced\r\ncandidacy of a Portuguese-speaking country, Brazil.\r\nSince the opening last year of the forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, several important\r\npolitical events have taken place in the world. We were\r\nparticularly struck by the magnificent example of maturity\r\nand vision offered by the people of South Africa and its\r\nleaders, particularly President Mandela. We wish to share\r\nwith them the pride of all Africa and the admiration of\r\nthe international community.\r\nUnfortunately, the lessons to be derived from this\r\nexample have not yet been put into practice in some cases\r\nin our region. Recent events in Rwanda, which have\r\nbrought such great pain to its people and especially its\r\nchildren, are a tragedy which our conscience demands\r\nnever be repeated on our continent. Moreover, hostilities\r\ncontinue that could and should have been over by now,\r\nwhile opportunities for peace and reconciliation have been\r\nmissed again and again, in particular in Liberia. The\r\nagreements already concluded among the Liberians must\r\nnow be implemented and an end must be put once and for\r\nall to armed clashes and their repercussions on\r\nneighbouring countries and the West African region.\r\nThe conflict that has so long afflicted Angola has\r\npassed through a stage of incredibly destructive, deadly\r\nviolence following the failure peacefully to implement the\r\nresults of the elections of September 1991, even though\r\nthose elections were supervised and declared free and fair\r\nby the United Nations. We very much hope that the\r\npresent stage of negotiations between the Government of\r\nAngola and UNITA will finally herald a cessation of\r\nhostilities in the near future and the opening of an era of\r\npeace, reconstruction and progress so long awaited by a\r\npeople with which Cape Verdeans feel such brotherly\r\nsolidarity.\r\nThe coming elections in Mozambique will doubtless\r\nclose an era in which national interests have prevailed,\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nbut also in which the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity have rendered praiseworthy assistance. We\r\nwish Mozambique all success in these elections, during\r\nwhich Cape Verde will be present as part of an observer\r\nteam from the United Nations Operation in Mozambique.\r\nIt is essential that the parties continue rigourously to\r\nobserve the rules of the democratic game by unequivocally\r\naccepting the outcome of the elections once these have been\r\ndeclared free and fair by the international community.\r\nWe are gratified by the way in which the recent first\r\nlegislative and presidential elections in Guinea-Bissau took\r\nplace and by the peaceful respect shown for its results.\r\nThis attests to the sense of responsibility of the political\r\nleaders of the country.\r\nIn Sao Tome and Principe, the established democratic\r\nsystem was reaffirmed by the calm that prevailed during the\r\nelectoral process that was completed at the end of last\r\nweek.\r\nWe also wish to declare our support and\r\nencouragement for the continuation of the talks which are\r\ntaking place under the auspices of the Secretary-General\r\nbetween Portugal, Indonesia and representatives of East\r\nTimor. We hope that they are taking place on the basis of\r\nforms of participation that respect the fundamental rights of\r\nthe citizens of East Timor.\r\nAs regards the maintenance of peace, it must be\r\nrecognized that in recent times notable progress has been\r\nmade on the international level, in the United Nations in\r\nparticular. The improvement of this capability must\r\ncontinue, and this will require even greater cooperation and\r\ncomplementarity with the regional organizations. Africa is\r\nshowing what it can do in this area, but obstacles to\r\nmaximizing this potential remain in the form of gaps that\r\nmust be filled through more consistent, predictable and\r\ntimely support by the United Nations and the partner\r\ncountries.\r\nThe prevention of conflicts remains, in any case, the\r\nprimary objective to be sought. The action to be taken to\r\nthis effect finds its reference points in the recommendations\r\nin \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). However, the\r\nultimate success of prevention will continue to depend on\r\nthe longer-term task of eliminating the deeper causes of the\r\nconflicts, which, of course, are many. In addition, it will\r\nbe crucial to tackle them simultaneously, not only to\r\nproduce synergy but also so that the relevant lessons can be\r\nlearned concerning these causes and the relations between\r\nthem.\r\nOne of the major causes of the instability that\r\ngenerates conflict is poverty, to which we referred earlier.\r\nThat in itself would be sufficient to lend urgency to the\r\neradication of poverty. However, the scope and nature of\r\nthe phenomenon require of us a reaction based on the\r\nmoral aspects of the heritage of mankind.\r\nToday, it is understood that all peoples must live in\r\ndignity; that is their basic human right, and we must\r\nguarantee them the realization of that right. This need\r\nmust transcend the present stage of mere words, and a\r\nprogramme must be implemented to transform the\r\nsituation. A particularly valuable contribution to this is in\r\nthe works: the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nfor which preparations are now under way. Within this\r\nframework, there will be a need to analyse the\r\ndevelopment of the human being in society, and not just\r\nsome reduced concept of the social element as an\r\nobjective. We still have enough time, and it is our duty\r\nto muster the necessary will to achieve the goals set for\r\nthis important Summit.\r\nThe fact that for countless individuals it is\r\nimpossible to benefit from contemporary parameters of\r\nwell-being has resulted in the major migrations of our era,\r\nwhich reveal the critical imbalances which continue in\r\ncertain regions of the world. The solution can, clearly,\r\ncome only from development and from the rejection of\r\nscenarios in which some parts of the world or groups of\r\npeople are excluded or marginalized. In the meantime,\r\nwe emphasize the need to see implemented the\r\nrecommendations of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development concerning refugees,\r\ndisplaced persons and migrants, a timely instrument\r\nwhich has been made available to us.\r\nWithin the framework of global development one of\r\nthe major questions that arises is that of Africa. This\r\nquestion must continue to be given very high priority on\r\nthe international agenda and on the agenda of the United\r\nNations. The seriousness of the situation prevailing on\r\nour continent, the longstanding nature of the problem and\r\nthe observation of indicators for future prospects deserve\r\nto be met as a particularly complex challenge and should\r\nnever be considered as a pretext for showing lassitude or\r\nindifference. The lack of progress in Africa would be a\r\nset-back for all, not just for the Africans. We are\r\nconvinced that this fact will become increasingly clear to\r\nus.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nIn the 1990s in particular, Africa undertook, in rather\r\ndifficult conditions, reforms and economic adjustments as\r\nwell as political and managerial transformations. The\r\nAfrican achievement certainly has not yet reached its\r\noptimal goal, but it must be said that on many occasions it\r\nwas not adequately supported by external measures and\r\nresources, which are, after all, indispensable complements.\r\nThe African economic and political systems doubtless\r\nstill have a long way to go, and they must become more\r\neffective and be based on the participation of all. African\r\nregional cooperation must increase its pace and must obtain\r\nincreased benefits. However, the continent must be the\r\nbeneficiary of, inter alia, a major reduction in its debt\r\nburden, the elimination of obstacles to its exports, vigorous\r\nforeign investments and increasing international assistance\r\nbetter adapted to national policies.\r\nReferring again to the constraints that are affecting\r\nAfrica in particular, we reiterate the need to mobilize\r\nadequate and sufficient resources to allow for the\r\nimplementation of the International Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification, in particular concerning the Sudan and\r\nSahel region and in cooperation with the Inter-State\r\nCommittee for Drought Control in the Sahel. For Cape\r\nVerde, which is coordinating the activities of this\r\nCommittee, it is particularly important that this event be\r\ncrowned with success.\r\nNext year, as we approach the end of the twentieth\r\ncentury, we shall be marking the fiftieth anniversary of our\r\nOrganization. There are numerous reasons to celebrate this\r\nevent, especially if we were to try to imagine what the\r\nworld would be like without the United Nations. My\r\ncountry cannot forget the role which the Organization\r\nplayed in its political emancipation and in its development\r\nefforts following that emancipation, nor do we forget that\r\nit offers a forum in which small countries can have their\r\nsay and participate in the deliberations. We welcome in\r\nthis context the holding of the United Nations Conference\r\non the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, and we hope that the results of the Conference will\r\nbe fully implemented.\r\nThe time has come to consolidate the feeling of a\r\nshared destiny among the diverse nations that are today\r\ngathered together within the Organization. We must no\r\nlonger put off the task of setting out on those recharted\r\npaths which our aspirations require.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime\r\nMinister and Minister of Defence of the Republic of Cape\r\nVerde for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Carlos Alberto Wahnon de Carvalho Veiga,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister of Defence of the\r\nRepublic of Cape Verde, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Abdulaziz Kamilov.\r\nMr. Kamilov (Uzbekistan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Allow me to join preceding speakers in\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of\r\nthe current session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI should also like to pay a tribute to His Excellency\r\nMr. Samuel Insanally for his successful leadership as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nTaking advantage of this opportunity, I should like\r\nto express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, and I should like to thank him for his\r\nsubstantive contribution to enhancing the authority of the\r\nUnited Nations and his efforts with a view to the\r\nmaintenance of peace in various regions of the planet.\r\nFor me, it is a great honour to address the Assembly\r\ntoday from this lofty rostrum on behalf of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Uzbekistan.\r\nJust recently, Uzbekistan marked the third\r\nanniversary of the proclamation of its independence.\r\nDuring this time, our country has undertaken significant\r\nefforts to strengthen the sovereignty of the States based\r\non the principles of democracy and to set up a free\r\nmarket structure.\r\nProfound economic and political transformations are\r\ntaking place in the Republic with a view to the formation\r\nof a socially oriented market economy.\r\nToday, a process of reform in Uzbekistan has\r\nreached a new qualitative level. The Parliament and the\r\nGovernment have adopted a number of significant and\r\nfundamental laws and decrees which are now opening the\r\nway to developing entrepreneurship and privatization.\r\nNew legislation guarantees the protection of private\r\nproperty. A number of legislative and economic\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nincentives for potential foreign investors have been\r\nprovided, and an extremely favourable environment has\r\nbeen created for their activities in the Republic’s markets.\r\nFor example, all limitations on the importation and\r\nexportation of foreign investments have been lifted.\r\nCustoms duties for goods imported into Uzbekistan have\r\nalso been cancelled. Joint ventures are exempt from taxes\r\nfor five years.\r\nThe process of privatization of State property is under\r\nway in the Republic. Commodity, currency and stock\r\nexchanges, as well as real estate markets, are being set up.\r\nThe most important process of introducing the national\r\ncurrency was recently completed in Uzbekistan.\r\nImplementation of the measures jointly agreed upon with\r\nthe International Monetary Fund will make it possible to\r\nhave a firm fiscal policy and will strengthen the national\r\ncurrency.\r\nPerhaps there is no country in the world that has\r\nsufficient experience to extend ready advice on how to\r\nchange social and economic structures smoothly. The\r\ncomplicated and very often controversial processes of the\r\ntransition to democracy and a market economy are being\r\ncarried out mainly on an empirical basis, and sometimes in\r\na highly contradictory situation.\r\nAn extremely complicated task for the people of\r\nUzbekistan is the perception of the basic principles of\r\ndemocracy and the socially oriented market economy, while\r\nat the same time preserving the development of its own rich\r\nhistory and unique culture and traditions. This is assuming\r\ntoday a decisive significance in the successful realization of\r\nthe task of renewing our society and in the construction of\r\nan independent State.\r\nThe steps the Government of Uzbekistan has been\r\nundertaking in order to reshape the political structure of the\r\nState have one more important aspect. They are not a goal\r\nin themselves; they are aimed at establishing conditions of\r\nsocial justice. In fact, in many countries, social justice has\r\nalready long been recognized as a fundamental principle of\r\nsocial life. In essence, if we look at the future in the long\r\nterm, without justice there cannot be any kind of stability,\r\npeace or security. There cannot be any social development,\r\nany freedom for the individual, human dignity or an\r\nacceptable quality of life for all.\r\nThe Constitution of Uzbekistan grants to all citizens of\r\nthe Republic basic rights and freedoms and provides for\r\ntheir equality before the law without distinction as to sex,\r\nrace, nationality, language, religion, social standing, or\r\npersonal beliefs.\r\nThe number of political parties and social\r\nmovements which are operating on the basis of the laws\r\nand decrees that have been adopted and incorporated into\r\nthe political system is gradually increasing. They will be\r\ntaking part in the parliamentary elections which will be\r\nheld in Uzbekistan in December 1994 on a multi-party\r\nbasis.\r\nSpeaking about political processes, I should like to\r\ntouch upon the issue of human rights. First of all, allow\r\nme to point out that the modern concept of the basic\r\nrights and freedoms of individuals was formed mainly on\r\nthe basis of a Western system of values and elaborated\r\nover a long period of time, under specific cultural and\r\nsocial conditions, and developed as part and parcel of\r\neconomic growth and better standards of living in\r\nWestern countries. This experience is hardly one that\r\ncould be mechanically transferred to other countries.\r\nWe do believe, however, that universally accepted\r\nhuman rights concepts should be adapted to the national,\r\nreligious and historical characteristics of different\r\ncountries. International practice has in many cases\r\ndemonstrated that unless society has reached a sufficient\r\nlevel of maturity and sustains it, it will be compelled to\r\na certain extent to constrain the freedom of the individual\r\nfor the sake of the preservation of the constitutional order.\r\nToday we live in a multidimensional world. Each\r\nnation is eager to establish its own political, social and\r\ncultural systems on the basis of respect for the national\r\nsovereignty of other States and the principle of non-\r\ninterference in their internal affairs. Therefore, we\r\nconsider the question of human rights in close connection\r\nwith that of the need to guarantee to the country stability\r\nand peace as the primary conditions for democratic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nI hope that the recent seminar of the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) on general\r\nissues, held in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan,\r\nprovided an opportunity to the international observers and\r\nits participants to see the gradual evolution of our society\r\ntowards democracy. At the same time, the seminar has\r\ndeepened our knowledge on possible ways to make\r\nprogress in the field of human rights.\r\nUnfortunately, the end of the confrontation between\r\ntwo social and political systems, which reached its peak\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nin the military sphere, has not brought about universal\r\npeace. The threat of global thermonuclear war has been\r\nreduced. Yet the world has encountered the emergence of\r\nseveral regional military conflicts. In this regard, I would\r\nlike to make known Uzbekistan’s position on the situations\r\nin Afghanistan and Tajikistan.\r\nFirst of all, we consider that settlement of these\r\nconflicts is solely the internal affair of Afghanistan and\r\nTajikistan. At the same time, one should keep in mind the\r\nfact that these States are the geographical neighbours of\r\nUzbekistan and that there is a potential danger of the\r\nregional escalation of these conflicts. That is why we view\r\nthe situation in these countries with great concern and we\r\nare interested in the earliest possible settlement of these\r\nconflicts by political and diplomatic means.\r\nI should particularly like to emphasize that today this\r\nregion is becoming a dangerous zone of open production of\r\nand trade in drugs and weapons. These conflicts are\r\nexacerbated by the fact that certain forces are secretly\r\nseeking to maintain tension in order to strengthen and\r\nexpand their influence by making use of various religious\r\nand nationalist slogans. Moreover, there are some\r\ninfluential groups of drug and weapon dealers interested in\r\ncontinuing the military confrontation for the sake of the\r\npreservation of their illegal profits.\r\nIn general, crises of this nature have revealed the\r\ninadequacy of the existing instruments to settle them\r\nthrough traditional means, given the new security demands\r\nof the post-cold-war era.\r\nIn this context, Uzbekistan welcomes any initiative by\r\nindividual countries or groups of countries, as well as by\r\nthe United Nations, aimed at settling the conflicts. The\r\nnew possibilities of the United Nations could expand the\r\nspectrum of military-political measures for stabilizing\r\nsituations in such explosive regions, including within the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS). At the same\r\ntime, taking into consideration the importance of ensuring\r\nthe sovereignty of countries that have recently achieved\r\nindependence and embarked on their own path of\r\ndevelopment, we believe it would be expedient to have\r\nrecourse to such measures, with the agreement of\r\nGovernments interested in such United Nations assistance\r\nor with the agreement of the parties to the dispute to a\r\nmediating role by the United Nations.\r\nFor its part, Uzbekistan has been taking steps to\r\nimprove the situation in the region. At the forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, President Karimov of\r\nUzbekistan proposed the convening in Tashkent of a\r\nstanding seminar on security issues under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations. Today, plans for this idea are\r\nbecoming clearer. About 15 States have already\r\nexpressed their interest in participating in the seminar.\r\nWe hope that in the near future the first seminar of this\r\nkind will take place. We are ready to welcome its\r\nparticipants to the ancient and peaceful land of\r\nUzbekistan.\r\nUzbekistan is also proposing for consideration at one\r\nof the forthcoming meetings of the Security Council the\r\nquestion of imposing an embargo on the sale of weapons\r\nand ammunition in zones of regional conflict.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to note that\r\nthere are certain groups in some countries which are\r\nintentionally spreading false information about ostensible\r\ninterference by Uzbekistan in the internal affairs of\r\nAfghanistan by taking sides with one of the conflicting\r\nparties. In fact, the only support Uzbekistan is rendering\r\nto this neighbouring country is humanitarian aid for its\r\nsuffering people, as requested by the Government of\r\nAfghanistan, as well as to Tajik refugees who fled to\r\nAfghanistan. This assistance is extended through the\r\nrepresentation of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees in the City of Termez.\r\nI should like to pay tribute to the active role the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE are taking in this process\r\nthrough their special envoys. We also highly appreciate\r\nthe productive activities of the regional representation of\r\nthe United Nations in Uzbekistan.\r\nI should now like to touch upon one more problem\r\nwhich is a threat for many countries - illegal drug-\r\ntrafficking. In the Republic of Uzbekistan, on the basis\r\nof the laws of Uzbekistan and according to Conventions\r\nof the United Nations of 1961, 1971 and 1988, preventive\r\nmeasures to cut off illegal activities related to the drug\r\ntrade are now being undertaken.\r\nIn general, narcotics come to Uzbekistan through\r\nneighbouring countries, where, owing to unstable political\r\nsituations, control over the drugs business has been\r\nweakened. Moreover, most of these narcotics are in\r\ntransit to European countries.\r\nIn 1993 more than 14 tons of narcotics, with a value\r\nof more than $600 million, were seized from criminals in\r\nUzbekistan and were destroyed. The majority of these\r\nwere intended for sale in Russia and in European\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\ncountries. In this connection, we call for the imposition of\r\neffective measures to prevent the illegal trafficking in drugs\r\nand to coordinate international efforts. An example of the\r\nsuccessful cooperation between law-enforcement institutions\r\nis the Agreement signed in 1992 by the Ministry of Internal\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan and its counterparts\r\nin Russia, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan,\r\nTajikistan, Belarus and Ukraine.\r\nSince October 1993 the Republic has been maintaining\r\nclose cooperation with the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme. The visit of the Deputy\r\nExecutive Director of this United Nations Programme,\r\nMr. Georgio Giacomelli, to Uzbekistan was an important\r\nevent in the development of cooperation on this issue. A\r\ndocument defining a long-term programme of collaboration\r\nagainst narcotics was signed during the course of that visit.\r\nI should like especially to draw attention to the\r\nimportant role that regional representatives involved in the\r\nUnited Nations Programme have been playing in the\r\ncoordination of international efforts to solve this global\r\nproblem. This process was begun in Tashkent at the\r\ninvitation of the President of Uzbekistan.\r\nWe shall do our utmost to cooperate with all interested\r\ncountries and organizations to bring the narco-business to\r\nan end.\r\nI must not miss this opportunity to refer briefly to\r\nenvironmental issues. We are grateful to the United\r\nNations and to the specialized agencies concerned with\r\nenvironmental control and with the prevention of global\r\necological disasters. We are ready to provide all possible\r\nassistance in this noble task.\r\nCentral Asia, like many other regions of the world,\r\nhas experienced ecological disasters of global dimensions.\r\nI refer, first and foremost, to the tragedy of the Aral Sea.\r\nOver a period of several years the volume of water has\r\ndropped more than three times, the area has diminished two\r\ntimes; and the shoreline has receded 80 kilometres. Owing\r\nto these factors the desert has eaten up more than 2 million\r\nhectares of arable land. The dust-storm radius has\r\nincreased by more than 300 kilometres. These\r\ndevelopments have had a negative effect on the sanitary\r\nsituation in the region. It is the opinion of United Nations\r\nexperts that, in terms of ecological and socio-economic\r\nimplications, the Aral Sea tragedy is one of the greatest\r\ndisasters of the twentieth century.\r\nThe death of the Aral Sea, which is possible, could\r\nhave unpredictable consequences for the whole world.\r\nThis is why we are appealing to the international\r\ncommunity to help to save the Aral Sea and the Aral\r\nregion.\r\nOne possible means of solving this global problem\r\nis the creation of an international commission of experts\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, which would\r\ninitiate projects and make recommendations. The\r\nGovernment of Uzbekistan, for its part, would provide all\r\npossible support for the activities of the commission.\r\nThe profound changes that have taken place in the\r\nworld over the past half century require adaptation to new\r\nrealities. There are now about 200 States, and the roles\r\nof many countries have changed. Some now have the\r\nright to be regarded as great Powers. Huge economic\r\nunions are being formed by States. Regional and global\r\ncooperation is an increasing trend. Because of the need\r\nfor effective management of the processes of economic\r\nintegration Governments are voluntarily transferring some\r\nof their sovereign rights to newly created joint political\r\ninstitutions. On the other hand, these trends underline the\r\nfact that a State should be recognized as a sovereign\r\nmember of the world community so that such cooperation\r\nmay be possible.\r\nThe time is now ripe for the full realization of the\r\nfundamental principles of the United Nations, which were\r\nset down when the Organization was founded nearly 50\r\nyears ago. The United Nations procedures must be\r\nrejected; these procedures came into being largely under\r\nthe influence of the spirit - which until recently had\r\nprevailed within these walls - of the cumbersome, often\r\nineffective and over-bureaucratic confrontation between\r\nthe United States and the USSR.\r\nThe necessary reforms are already producing results.\r\nI refer in particular to the recent decision to establish the\r\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services. As an Under-\r\nSecretary-General, the head of this Office will be able to\r\ninitiate a more substantial discussion on the impending\r\nphases of reform of the Organization.\r\nThere is no doubt that the evolution of the Security\r\nCouncil is still the most important and most complicated\r\nissue. How are we to reconcile the need to increase the\r\nnumber of permanent members, so that they are\r\nrepresentative of all the regions of the world, with the\r\nneed to make the Council more effective towards the\r\nsolution of urgent international problems?\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nHow can the desire to reduce the level of bureaucracy\r\nin the United Nations be reconciled with the efforts to\r\nincrease the number of permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil? And will the exercise of the right of veto remain\r\npredominant, or should consensus become the main means\r\nof adopting decisions?\r\nThese and many other issues are multidimensional and\r\ncomplex. They affect the interests of many countries,\r\nwhich often have quite different points of view, both in\r\nterms of the internal procedures of the United Nations and\r\nin terms of the means of settling international problems. It\r\nis obvious that this process will be difficult and time-\r\nconsuming. We have no doubt that, ultimately, the\r\nquestion of increased membership of the Security Council\r\nshould be considered in the context of the principle of\r\nrotation. Countries that now have the necessary capacity\r\nand sense of responsibility in respect of the maintenance of\r\npeace and security throughout the world, and at the same\r\ntime are representative of the various regions of the world,\r\nshould become additional permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nOur country bases its foreign policy on the realities of\r\nthe contemporary world. It aims for integration with the\r\nworld community through equal partnership with all other\r\ncountries. Of course, our current capabilities are limited,\r\nfor a number of understandable reasons. None the less, we\r\nare ready to contribute whatever is necessary for the\r\nresolution of global problems. We are eager to cooperate\r\nwith countries that are interested, and we are prepared to do\r\nso both at the bilateral level and within the framework of\r\nthe United Nations. We believe that the greater the number\r\nof parties involved in the discussion of international\r\nproblems and of the question of increasing the effectiveness\r\nof the international institutions, the more fruitful will be the\r\noutcome. Harmonization of the rights of individuals,\r\nnations and people, together with a common interest in\r\nsecuring peace and development in the world, should\r\nbecome the main tool for resolving problems.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia, His\r\nRoyal Highness Prince Saud Al-Faisal.\r\nPrince Saud Al-Faisal (Saudia Arabia) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): It is with pleasure that I begin this speech\r\nby conveying to you, Sir, our most sincere congratulations\r\non your election to the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nat its forty-ninth session. Your election not only reflects\r\nthe trust placed in you personally but also bespeaks the\r\nregard of the international community for your country,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire. We wish you success in the pursuit of\r\nyour mission.\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Samuel Insanally, on the effective\r\nmanner in which he conducted the affairs of the General\r\nAssembly at its last session.\r\nI also wish to note the sincere efforts by the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to consolidate peace and to\r\nreduce the tensions that beset many parts of the world.\r\nIt is with great pleasure, Sir, that I convey to you the\r\nbest wishes of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques,\r\nKing Fahad bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, and his hope that at\r\nthis session the General Assembly will successfully deal\r\nwith international developments, benefitting from the\r\nopportunities provided by the principles and other\r\nfoundations upon which contemporary international\r\nrelations rest.\r\nThe Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy\r\nMosques has always been willing to play a positive role\r\nin the international arena, and to contribute to achieving\r\nour common goals of security, stability and prosperity.\r\nThe principles and other foundations of our present\r\ninternational order derive their legitimacy and strength\r\nfrom the tenets of the United Nations Charter, which are\r\ninherent in international legality. The most important of\r\nthese principles are: respect for the sovereignty and\r\nindependence of nations; the inviolability of international\r\nborders; the establishment of justice and equality between\r\nnations; rejection of the use of force in the settlement of\r\nconflicts; safeguarding human dignity; and ensuring\r\nsecurity and prosperity for all mankind. Based on its\r\nadherence to Islamic shari’a, the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia is committed to the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, and has endeavoured throughout the\r\nOrganization’s history to implement those principles in\r\npractice.\r\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council, whose current\r\nsession my country has the honour of chairing, bases\r\nitself on the principles of the United Nations Charter. We\r\nare convinced that the international community’s success\r\nin serving the cause of international peace and security\r\nwill depend on the commitment by its members to the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and on the strength of their\r\npolitical will to apply the resolutions of international\r\nlegality.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nWhile the firm unified international stand in\r\nconfronting Iraq’s aggression against the State of Kuwait in\r\n1990 was vindicated when the aggression was reversed and\r\ninternational legality was restored, the conflict in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina remains unresolved. Serb aggression\r\nagainst the Bosnian people continues. This is because the\r\naggression has not been dealt with in accordance with the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and the principles of international\r\nlegality. It is incumbent upon this Organization, and in\r\nparticular the Security Council, to move swiftly and\r\neffectively to demonstrate that aggression is bound to fail,\r\nwhether in Kuwait, in Bosnia or in any other part of the\r\nworld.\r\nEven a cursory glance at the current international\r\nsituation would be sufficient to highlight the need for an\r\neffective United Nations role and for implementation of the\r\nCharter in order to deal with the chronic hotbeds of tension\r\nthat are widespread and that continue to threaten security\r\nand stability in many parts of the world. This requires us\r\nto strengthen further the role of the United Nations as an\r\neffective vehicle for creating the proper conditions for\r\nworld peace and stability.\r\nWe in the Gulf Cooperation Council recognize the\r\nprominent role played by the Secretary-General in\r\nfashioning a new approach for the United Nations based on\r\nthe principles of the United Nations Charter and the norms\r\nof international legality. We welcomed the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals in his \"An Agenda for Peace\", and we\r\nlook forward to his agenda for development. The ideas\r\ncontained in those two reports are bound to make an\r\nimportant contribution to the efforts of the General\r\nAssembly to enhance the role and effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations. Success in achieving this aim will rely to\r\na great extent on the degree of support by Member States\r\nfor the principles and principles of the United Nations. The\r\nmost important of these are: the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security; peacemaking through the\r\ndeterrence of aggression; the elimination of threats to the\r\nsecurity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations; and\r\nthe promotion of cooperation in the service of international\r\ndevelopment.\r\nUnder the United Nations Charter, the Security\r\nCouncil, the body most directly concerned with the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, has the\r\nprimary responsibility for dealing with international\r\nproblems. As we pursue reform of United Nations organs,\r\nit is therefore crucial that the Council be made more\r\ncapable and better equipped to carry out its mandate under\r\nthe Charter.\r\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council attaches great\r\nimportance to a number of regional and international\r\nissues. We greatly appreciated the important role played\r\nby the United Nations following the Iraqi aggression\r\nagainst Kuwait. That role clearly reflected the\r\ninternational community’s expectations regarding the\r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations. It also highlighted\r\nthe ability of the Security Council to confront aggression\r\nand reverse its effects. We hope that this solidarity will\r\nhelp guarantee that no repetition of this aggression can\r\noccur. This can be achieved only through complete and\r\ntotal implementation of all Security Council resolutions\r\non the matter. The Iraqi Government continues to defy\r\ninternational legality and to attempt to deceive\r\ninternational public opinion through limited\r\nimplementation of some of the requirements of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 661 (1990) and 687 (1991) pertaining\r\nto the issue of weapons of mass destruction. The true\r\nobjective of these Iraqi efforts is to circumvent Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, which contain a number of\r\nrequirements accepted by the Iraqi Government and which\r\ntogether form an interrelated legal structure. In its last\r\nreview of the sanctions imposed on Iraq, the Security\r\nCouncil decided to continue the application of those\r\nsanctions; this demonstrates that the efforts of the Iraqi\r\nGovernment to deceive the world community have not\r\nborne fruit.\r\nIraq has yet to meet the essence of its obligations,\r\nwhich lies in full and irrevocable recognition of the State\r\nof Kuwait and of its borders. To do this it must officially\r\naccept Security Council resolution 833 (1993), which\r\ndemarcated the international borders between Kuwait and\r\nIraq and provided international guarantees for those\r\nborders under the cease-fire agreements set out in\r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991), which was\r\naccepted by the Iraqi Government. And in view of the\r\nfact that the Iraqi Government has repeatedly violated its\r\ninternational and legal obligations, we feel it is necessary\r\nto insist that Iraq’s recognition of Kuwait and its borders\r\nshould be irrevocably stated, in conformity with the\r\nconstitutional measures applied in Iraq and based on the\r\ninternational guarantees contained in the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council resolution 833 (1993). Furthermore,\r\nIraq must comply with its commitment to release all\r\nKuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees. While\r\nwe welcome Iraq’s participation on the committee dealing\r\nwith prisoners and detainees, we hope that its\r\nparticipation is a genuine attempt to settle this\r\nhumanitarian issue and not merely a symbolic move to\r\nappease international public opinion.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nThe Government of Iraq is also expected to pay full\r\ncompensation for all the damage caused by its aggression.\r\nIt must refrain from committing or sponsoring any acts of\r\nterrorism or subversion. All of the above requirements\r\nrepresent a series of interrelated international legal\r\nobligations, that must be complied with in their entirety.\r\nThe States of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),\r\nwhile reiterating their commitment to the unity, sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity of Iraq, wish to voice their concern\r\nover the continuing suffering of the Iraqi people, the sole\r\nresponsibility for which lies with the Iraqi Government\r\nwhich rejects the implementation of United Nations\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991)\r\nwhich deal with the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.\r\nThe GCC States have actively participated in the\r\nMiddle East peace process since its inception at the Madrid\r\nPeace Conference. The GCC States contributed to\r\nadvancing the bilateral talks between the Arab States and\r\nIsrael. They have also participated effectively in the\r\nmultilateral talks. The Arab delegations’ commitment to\r\nand participation in this process gave a clear indication of\r\ntheir sincere intention to work towards a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace in the region. The multilateral talks\r\nare an integral part of the peace process launched in Madrid\r\nand complement the bilateral talks and not a substitute\r\nthereto.\r\nThe signing of the Declaration of Principles between\r\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization and the Israeli\r\nGovernment in Washington in 1993, raised hopeful\r\nexpectations, since it represented the first step towards the\r\nachievement of a just and permanent settlement of the\r\nPalestinian problem. While the Gulf Cooperation Council\r\nnotes with satisfaction the concrete progress made on the\r\nPalestinian-Israeli track and the important steps taken to\r\nexpand Palestinian self-rule and to transfer institutions to\r\nthe Palestinian National Authority, it calls upon the\r\ninternational community, and in particular on the\r\nco-sponsors of the peace process, the United States of\r\nAmerica and the Russian Federation, to ensure that Israel\r\nplaces no more obstacles in the path of the Palestinian\r\nNational Authority as it assumes its responsibilities.\r\nWhile we welcome the progress achieved on the\r\nJordanian-Israeli track, we wish to voice our deep concern\r\nover the lack of clear progress in the Syrian and Lebanese\r\ntracks. The issue of the occupied Golan Heights is clear\r\nand governed by the principles of respect for international\r\nborders. Security is not attained by the occupation of\r\nanother nation’s territory by force, but through the\r\nestablishment of peace, which can only be realized in this\r\nsituation by the total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied\r\nGolan Heights. The Lebanese-Israeli track is governed by\r\nUnited Nations Security Council resolution 425 (1978),\r\nwhich clearly calls for the immediate and unconditional\r\nwithdrawal of Israeli troops from the Lebanese territory.\r\nWe call for the complete and unconditional\r\nimplementation of the said resolution.\r\nThe question of Al-Quds Al-Shareef is at the heart\r\nof the Arab-Israeli conflict, and permanent peace cannot\r\nbe achieved in the Middle East without a just settlement\r\nof this issue. The settlement must take into account the\r\nresolutions of international legality, and in particular\r\nUnited Nations Security Council resolution 242 (1967),\r\nwhich calls for Israeli withdrawal from all territories\r\noccupied in 1967, and United Nations Security Council\r\nresolution 252 (1968) regarding Al-Quds Al-Shareef.\r\nIsrael is thus required to refrain from taking any measures\r\nthat would demographically change the status of the city\r\nof Al-Quds or prejudice future negotiations pertaining to\r\nits final status. Any permanent and comprehensive\r\nsettlement must also address the issue of the return of\r\nPalestinian refugees and the issue of settlements erected\r\nby Israel in the occupied territories in violation of\r\ninternational law and the Geneva conventions.\r\nConcrete progress on the various bilateral tracks on\r\nthe various aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict is bound to\r\nlead inevitably to similar progress with regard to the\r\nissues addressed in the multilateral talks and lay the\r\ngroundwork for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace\r\nin the Middle East.\r\nWe in the GCC are convinced that the success of the\r\nPalestinian National Authority in implementing the\r\nDeclaration of Principles depends on the support it\r\nreceives from the Palestinian people, as well as on the\r\npolitical and economic support it receives from the\r\ninternational community. It was on the basis of this\r\nconviction that the GCC States participated in the\r\ninternational donors conference held in Washington, D.C.\r\nin October of 1993 and pledged substantial financial\r\nassistance. The Gulf Cooperation Council States have\r\nalso contributed financially to the establishment of a\r\nPalestinian police force and administration to enable it to\r\nassume its duties. We have also announced, along with\r\nour Arab brethren at the 102nd session of the League of\r\nArab States, our full support for the Palestinian\r\nself-governing authority.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nIn the context of their pursuit to help the Middle East\r\nregion enjoy its legitimate share of security, peace and\r\nstability, the GCC States have focused great attention on\r\nefforts to rid the region of all weapons of mass destruction,\r\nwhether nuclear, chemical or biological. To achieve this\r\nobjective, we call on all countries in the region, including\r\nIsrael, to refrain from producing, possessing or stockpiling\r\nany such weapons.\r\nThe GCC States note with great concern the continued\r\noccupation of the three United Arab Emirates islands - Abu\r\nMoussa, the Greater and Lesser Tumbs - by the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran. The GCC States, motivated by a desire\r\nto have the best possible ties with the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, have repeatedly urged the Islamic Republic of Iran to\r\nrespond to the call of the United Arab Emirates to settle\r\nthis problem by peaceful means through serious bilateral\r\nnegotiations.\r\nThe Government of Iran, however, has not responded\r\nto these calls so far. We therefore call for referring this\r\nmatter to the International Court of Justice, which is\r\nresponsible for settling disputes among nations.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is taking\r\nplace at a time when the plight of the Bosnian people is\r\nworsening as a result of the war of extermination and\r\nethnic cleansing waged by the Serbian forces with the\r\nsupport of Serbia and Montenegro. In spite of the\r\noptimism generated by the Muslim-Croat agreement to\r\nestablish a federation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and their\r\nacceptance of the peace plan proposed by the international\r\nContact Group, and welcomed by all of us the Serbian\r\nforces continue to challenge the international peace-keeping\r\nforces of the United Nations, in total disregard of United\r\nNations resolutions. In so doing, the Serbian forces have\r\nbeen emboldened by the inability of the international\r\ncommunity, and in particular the States of the European\r\nCommunity which have a special responsibility vis-à-vis\r\nthis tragedy, to implement the necessary sanctions and\r\nimpose the required punishment, to stop the Serb\r\naggression. The Serb forces have rejected the proposed\r\npeace plan and escalated their attacks against Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, which makes it patently clear that their\r\nintention is to undermine all the peaceful efforts undertaken\r\nby the United Nations.\r\nWe listened with keen interest to the speech by\r\nPresident Alija Izetbegovic, which gave a graphic\r\ndescription of the dangerous situation in his country. In the\r\nlight of this we are concerned that the hasty adoption by the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council of its resolution 943\r\n(1994), which provides for relaxing the United Nations\r\nsanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro, could\r\npreclude a just settlement and lead to rewarding the\r\naggression. It is incumbent upon the international\r\ncommunity, and the Security Council in particular, to take\r\nthe necessary action to remedy this tragic situation. This\r\naction must include declaring the entirety of the Republic\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina a safe haven, and providing\r\nfor the deployment of international observers equipped\r\nwith a clear mandate, and sufficiently credible powers, in\r\nthese safe havens and along the borders of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. They should also include the recognition of\r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Serbia and\r\nMontenegro before any consideration is given to the\r\ngradual lifting of the sanctions imposed on them. United\r\nNations forces must also protect the areas of safe haven\r\nand provide for their defence. The failure of the United\r\nNations to provide the required protection for the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina makes it necessary\r\nto lift the arms embargo so as to allow it to exercise its\r\nlegitimate right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51\r\nof the United Nations Charter.\r\nSomalia continues to be in the grip of a situation of\r\ninstability and political chaos coupled with acts of\r\nviolence and bloodshed. In spite of all the efforts\r\ndeployed to extricate this nation from its plight, instability\r\nand lack of security still plague this troubled land. The\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has tried on a number\r\nof occasions to contain the conflict in Somalia, to bring\r\nabout national reconciliation between the various factions\r\nand which has provided humanitarian assistance and relief\r\nto the fraternal Somali people, calls upon all factions to\r\nlisten to the voice of reason and logic, to put the interests\r\nof the Somali people above all else and to work towards\r\nnational reconciliation.\r\nThe feelings of optimism and jubilation triggered by\r\nthe victory of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan and the\r\nrestoration of that country’s independence and identity are\r\nnow overshadowed by feelings of disappointment and\r\nbitterness as a result of the continued infighting between\r\nthe various Mujahideen factions. The Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia has endeavoured, under the direction and guidance\r\nof the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd\r\nbin Abdulaziz, to put an end to the fratricide among our\r\nAfghani brethren. These efforts were crowned when all\r\nfactions were assembled in 1993 at the House of God in\r\nMakkah, and an agreement was signed to restore unity,\r\nsecurity and stability to the nation of Afghanistan. We\r\ncontinue to urge all factions of the Afghani Mujahideen\r\nimmediately to put an end to the infighting by complying\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nwith the \"Makkah Agreement\" in letter and in spirit, so as\r\nto move in the direction of reconstruction and development\r\nand, thereby, to enable their nation to resume its proper\r\nplace in the international community.\r\nThe conflict over Jamu-Kashmir continues to cast its\r\nshadow over relations between the two neighbours, India\r\nand Pakistan, and represents one of the elements of\r\ninstability in this part of the world. My Government\r\ncontinues to watch with concern the bloodshed there. We\r\nwish to voice the view that there is a need for a solution to\r\nthis chronic problem. It has become clear that violence\r\nagainst the Kashmiri people, and the use of military force\r\nwill achieve nothing but the further deterioration of the\r\nsituation in Kashmir. It will also feed the flames of\r\ninstability in the region. A peaceful solution to this\r\nproblem lies in the implementation of the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions and in dialogue and understanding. It\r\nis in that way that an end may be put to yet another hotbed\r\nof tension and instability in the world.\r\nAmong the other conflicts in Central Asia, the conflict\r\nbetween two Member States of the United Nations, the\r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia,\r\nresulted at one stage in the occupation by Armenia of parts\r\nof Azerbaijan. As this occupation constitutes a violation of\r\nthe principle of the inadmissability of the use of force in\r\nthe resolution of disputes, it is incumbent upon Armenian\r\nforces to withdraw from Azerbaijani territory and to\r\ntransfer this issue to the negotiating table for the purpose of\r\narriving at a peaceful and just settlement which would\r\nsafeguard the legitimate rights of the Azerbaijani people.\r\nSuch a review of the hotbeds of tension and crises in\r\nour world must not cause us to lose sight of the important\r\nand positive developments which the world witnessed over\r\nthe past decade and which should give us cause for hope in\r\na better future for mankind. We continue to have great\r\nexpectations as a result of the positive developments in the\r\naftermath of the cold war, and the emergence of solutions\r\nto pressing problems in Cambodia, the Middle East and\r\nNorthern Ireland. The historic change in South Africa has\r\nbrought down the curtain on the system of apartheid and\r\nbrought forth a new South Africa based on justice and\r\nequality. We welcome these positive developments which\r\nare bound to contribute to the strengthening of the\r\ninternational tendency to move towards compliance with the\r\nprinciples of international law, respect for the resolutions of\r\ninternational legality, the renunciation of the use of force in\r\nfavour of dialogue as a means for resolving problems and\r\ndisputes.\r\nA general overview of international economic issues\r\nand the role played by the United Nations to strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation shows that the success of the\r\nOrganization in dealing with economic issues and\r\npromoting international development, is also tied to the\r\ncommitment of its Members to the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral\r\ntrade negotiations is a commendable example of the\r\ninternational community’s success in addressing a number\r\nof sensitive issues with unprecedented results. We are\r\nwitnessing the emergence of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, which we hope will embody our vision of\r\nan institutionalized global economic system. The\r\nMarakesh conference of the contracting parties to the\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has\r\nsucceeded in fulfilling the aims of the Bretton Woods\r\nConference.\r\nWhile we appreciate this important development, we\r\nmust state our concerns over the increase in protectionism\r\nand the resulting tensions between trading partners. This\r\ndevelopment contradicts the premises of the Uruguay\r\nRound regarding the importance of allowing market\r\nforces to play their natural role in economic affairs in a\r\nmanner which allows nations to benefit from comparative\r\nadvantages and from the optimal utilization of resources.\r\nThis can only be achieved through serious international\r\nefforts to ensure free trade. We also wish to state our\r\nconcern over the increase in protectionism in the guise of\r\nprotecting the environment, and in particular the increased\r\ntaxation on petroleum.\r\nAt this point, I wish to emphasize the importance the\r\nGulf Cooperation Council attaches to the protection of the\r\nenvironment, which is reflected in the adoption by our\r\nemerging industries of the highest standards of\r\nenvironmental protection. We are concerned that\r\npetroleum, which is our principal export commodity, is\r\nalready heavily burdened by taxation, and yet it is now\r\nbeing targeted for further taxation while other, more\r\npolluting fuels are receiving subsidies from Governments.\r\nCoal is a case in point: according to studies published by\r\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment and the International Energy Agency, coal\r\nsubsidies in industrial States amount to more than twice\r\nthe cost of comparable energy provided by imported\r\npetroleum. Furthermore, according to the same sources,\r\ntax reforms that take into consideration the carbon content\r\nof fuel could produce more than double the reduction in\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\ncarbon dioxide emissions targeted by the proposed carbon\r\ntaxes without further taxation on petroleum.\r\nWe, the member States of the Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil, are convinced that imposing additional taxes on\r\npetroleum will not contribute to the environment but will\r\ninstead distort international trade. This would adversely\r\naffect not only the economies of oil-exporting nations, but\r\nalso those of oil-importing nations. It would also\r\nundermine the development efforts of developing countries.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its sister States in\r\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council have great respect for the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, for international legality and for the\r\nresolutions deriving therefrom. We have not, and will not,\r\nhesitate to work towards strengthening the role of the\r\nUnited Nations and enhancing its effectiveness to ensure\r\ninternational peace and security and promote international\r\ncooperation. We hope with all sincerity that all other\r\nMember States will share this view when dealing with the\r\nvarious issues before the Assembly at this session.\r\nWe are confident that the opportunity to achieve\r\nsuccess still remains before us and that what is required is\r\nto heed the words of God Almighty:\r\n\"And say work; and soon Allah will observe your\r\nwork, and his messenger, and the believer\".\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nnext on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Paraguay, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner.\r\nMr. Ramirez Boettner (Paraguay) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I wish cordially to greet you, Mr. Amara\r\nEssy of Côte d’Ivoire, and to congratulate you on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. I\r\npledge the fullest cooperation of the delegation of Paraguay.\r\nNor can I fail to echo the congratulations offered to\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally on the way he guided the\r\nwork of the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nIt is my pleasure also to hail the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and convey to him well-\r\ndeserved congratulations on the excellent manner in which\r\nhe has carried out his tasks. On behalf of the Government\r\nand the people of Paraguay, a founding Member of the\r\nUnited Nations, I pledge to him our full support for the\r\nOrganization. It is our hope that he will visit our country\r\nas soon as he can; this would be further testament to our\r\nsupport for the United Nations and to our expectations as\r\nto what the United Nations can do to assist Paraguay in\r\nits current process of full democratization. That\r\ndemocratization has been under way in Paraguay since\r\nFebruary 1989; it is now being consolidated under the\r\nAdministration of Mr. Juan Carlos Wasmosy, President of\r\nthe Republic.\r\nIn this Hall one year ago, the President of Paraguay\r\ncommitted himself to consolidating the democratic\r\nprocess, with the support of the vast majority of\r\nParaguayans from the different political parties and\r\norganizations that demonstrate the pluralism of our\r\nsociety, which is irrevocably determined to defend\r\nfreedom, democracy and respect for human rights.\r\nToday, the name of Paraguay does not appear in the\r\ndossiers of human rights violations. Not a single United\r\nNations or other agency of the international community\r\nhas failed to note the undeniable progress in our country\r\nin every area connected with dignifying the human\r\nperson, and the efforts we have made in the social sector.\r\nHence, as I pledge on behalf of my Government and\r\nmy entire society that we shall never, under any\r\ncircumstances, diverge from the democratic ideal, I cannot\r\nfail to observe that problems remain in achieving a level\r\nof development with social justice; we shall keep trying\r\nto solve them resolutely, and in many cases with\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nWe shall not be satisfied until we secure for our\r\ninhabitants - Paraguayans and foreigners whom we have\r\nwelcomed into our land - living standards considered\r\nadequate according to United Nations indices. In view of\r\nthe magnitude of the task, we again stress that the burden\r\ncannot be borne by one people alone. For us to be\r\ncompetitive, conditions in the international system must\r\nchange: markets must be more open; credit must be more\r\nreadily available, and at lower interest rates; and\r\ntechnology must be more accessible. We therefore\r\nbelieve in global solidarity, especially of the developed\r\nnations.\r\nThe people of the developing countries cannot be\r\nasked to make greater sacrifices than they are already\r\nmaking unless they see a similar trend towards the\r\ntransformation of the international community. If\r\ndemocracy and freedom are to exist and endure, peoples\r\nmust enjoy development and better living conditions.\r\nI should like briefly to refer to our economic\r\nrecovery, which began in 1989 and has produced very\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nfavourable results, even during a period of transition and\r\nmajor structural changes.\r\nParaguay has been pursuing a policy of free trade and\r\nfloating exchange rates, coupled with total freedom of\r\nmovement for financial services and capital. The external\r\ndebt has been reduced to $1.26 billion, almost the same as\r\nour current reserves of $1 billion. Paraguay offers a variety\r\nof tax incentives to both its own and outside investors for\r\ninvestment in production activities. These incentives place\r\nour country among those offering the best and most\r\nattractive terms in Latin America.\r\nOur privatization policy, which started with money-\r\nlosing national industries, is already enshrined in our legal\r\ncode. Furthermore, we project a growth in gross domestic\r\nproduct of 4.5 per cent this year.\r\nEducation and training are a major priority of our\r\nGovernment, because it feels that accelerated development\r\ndepends on well-trained people.\r\nAs regards economic integration, the Treaty of\r\nAsunción was signed in the capital of Paraguay in 1991,\r\nestablishing the Common Market of the Southern Cone\r\n(MERCOSUR). At the recent meeting of the Presidents of\r\nthe MERCOSUR countries, held in Buenos Aires on\r\n5 August, they took a decisive step forward by agreeing by\r\nconsensus to establish a common external tariff.\r\nIn connection with this economic integration, we are\r\npleased to confirm that Paraguay firmly and enthusiastically\r\nsupports the negotiations on the entry into MERCOSUR of\r\nthe fraternal Republics of Bolivia and Chile. Paraguay has\r\nsuggested to its MERCOSUR partners the establishment of\r\nessential supranational machinery, such as the office of\r\nsecretary-general and a court of justice. That would allow\r\nus to hold joint negotiations with the European Union, as\r\nhas seemed feasible since its Council’s Corfu meeting, and\r\nwith the signatories of the North American Free Trade\r\nAgreement.\r\nThe summit of American nations convened in Miami\r\nby President Clinton will be an event of great significance\r\nfor relations in this hemisphere in our common search for\r\never greater understanding among countries of this\r\ncontinent on political, economic and trade matters.\r\nAt the subregional level, only a few weeks ago we\r\nwere able to set in motion the first of 20 turbines of the\r\nhuge Yacyretá hydroelectric dam, built jointly by Paraguay\r\nand Argentina.\r\nThe Government of Paraguay has worked hard to\r\ndevelop ties with the outside world in order to break out\r\nof the isolation arising from its landlocked condition and,\r\nuntil 1989, its deliberate marginalization by an\r\nauthoritarian Government.\r\nIn bilateral terms, though it may seem redundant to\r\nsay this, it is appropriate to recall that Paraguay benefits\r\nfrom a vast hydroelectric capacity already in place: the\r\nItaipú station, shared with Brazil, with an output of 12.6\r\nmillion kilowatts; and that at Yacyretá, shared with\r\nArgentina, with an output of some 4 million kilowatts.\r\nThere is therefore no question but that Paraguay is now,\r\nand will remain, an ideal place for major foreign and\r\ndomestic investment and for implementing a policy of\r\nindustrialization, based on our abundant, low-cost energy.\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that Paraguay\r\nsuffers a structural limitation that would appear to limit\r\nits development potential: its lack of a seaboard. We\r\nwish to turn this handicap, which has had a very negative\r\nimpact on Paraguay in the past, into an advantage. I refer\r\nto the fact that Paraguay, being at the centre of\r\nMERCOSUR, can act as a hinge or pivot par excellence,\r\ntogether with Bolivia, between MERCOSUR and the\r\nAndean Common Market.\r\nAt the regional, Latin American level, I wish to refer\r\nfirst to Paraguay’s involvement in the Fourth Ibero-\r\nAmerican Summit of Heads of State and Government.\r\nThe presence of our entire Ibero-American community,\r\ntogether with Spain and Portugal, strengthened us all,\r\nbecause of the cultural, historical, political and other ties\r\nthat bind us closely. I should like to stress that Paraguay\r\nregards this conference as an essential link in its ties with\r\nthe European Union and as a major forum with great\r\npotential.\r\nAnother important event this year, again at the\r\nregional level, was the Eighth Conference of Presidents\r\nand Heads of Government of the Rio Group, which ended\r\na few weeks ago. Paraguay fully endorsed the\r\nDeclaration of the Rio Group, particularly with regard to\r\nthe situations in Haiti and Cuba and the problem of drug-\r\ntrafficking.\r\nParaguay actively participated in producing the\r\ndeclaration in regard to the fraternal Republic of Cuba,\r\nwhich expresses the strong hope that it will introduce\r\nsignificant political and economic reforms in accordance\r\nwith the people’s will, and stating that we respect the\r\nself-determination of peoples and the principle of non-\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nintervention. Paraguay lent its fullest support to the Rio\r\nGroup’s decisions, including its declaration on lifting the\r\nembargo against Cuba.\r\nWith regard to the new post of United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, Paraguay wishes to state\r\nthat his great efforts with regard to individual rights must\r\nbe complemented by the promotion of social and collective\r\nhuman rights.\r\nWe have throughout fully endorsed the principle of the\r\npeaceful resolution of international conflicts, including the\r\ncase of Haiti. In this, Paraguay is strengthened by its\r\ntraditional commitment to peace. In 1923 we contributed\r\nto international law for the Americas with the Gondra\r\nTreaty of conciliation and arbitration, which has become\r\none of the pillars of Latin America’s juridical system.\r\nAlong these lines of thought and practice, Paraguay\r\nenthusiastically welcomes the recent progress in connection\r\nwith the United Nations Decade of International Law.\r\nParaguay supports the codification of this branch of law; it\r\nwill be one of the greatest achievements of the United\r\nNations. In this connection, Paraguay has signed and\r\nratified the main agreements that constitute the legal\r\nstructure created through the United Nations.\r\nParaguay is keenly following and promoting\r\nmankind’s urgent demand for international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. For it is just as important to build peace\r\nthrough development as to maintain it through law. Here\r\nI want once more publicly to express our deep thanks to the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), whose\r\ntimely and effective work we have seen at first hand. We\r\nalso acknowledge the fundamental importance of the\r\ndevelopment work of the World Bank, the Inter-American\r\nBank and the International Monetary Fund.\r\nWe hail the Secretary-General’s recent decision to\r\nseek better coordination within the United Nations system\r\non technical cooperation and to make the Administrator of\r\nUNDP fully responsible for coordination system wide,\r\nincluding with the regional commissions and all other\r\nprogrammes. From this decision the United Nations will\r\ngain in efficiency and in the impact of its world-wide\r\nactivities.\r\nParaguay also backs the entire process for the Fourth\r\nUnited Nations Development Decade and the opening of\r\nnegotiations on international economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, which appears on the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nYet, in a spirit of honour and fraternity, I wish to\r\nrepeat what I said here in New York at the June 1994\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council - namely,\r\nthat:\r\n\"We feel that the distribution of funds for\r\nUnited Nations programmes and projects world wide\r\nis imbalanced; as Latin Americans, we believe that\r\nthe proportion allocated to our region, by UNDP for\r\nexample, is unfair: only 8.66 per cent is allocated\r\nfor programmes in Latin American countries, while\r\nother regions are allocated 50.42 per cent and 40.67\r\nper cent respectively\".\r\nUNDP contributes only 17 per cent to Paraguay’s\r\nprogramme; Paraguay pays the rest. But we appreciate\r\nand wish to continue to count on UNDP’s support.\r\nParaguay looks forward with keen interest and\r\ncommitment to the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, to be held at Copenhagen. We are\r\npreparing to participate in that conference and have high\r\nexpectations about the positive results it can achieve. We\r\nhave promised that the President of the Republic of\r\nParaguay will attend that great event. Paraguay is so\r\nenthusiastic about the conference because the three basic\r\nitems on its agenda are very closely connected with\r\ntoday’s social problems: social integration, particularly of\r\nthe most marginalized and disadvantaged groups; relief\r\nand reduction of poverty; and an increase in productive\r\nemployment. As the draft agenda points out, all of this\r\nmust be in the context of a propitious economic\r\nenvironment - and, we would add, with international\r\ncooperation. Here, Paraguay cannot fail to note that a\r\ncharacteristic of our times is economic growth without\r\njob-creation, a situation that must be corrected, since one\r\nof today’s problems is indeed unemployment.\r\nParaguay earnestly supports ongoing efforts, will\r\nsupport future efforts, developed by the United Nations in\r\nall areas of disarmament: nuclear, chemical and others.\r\nThe Assembly should know that in the area of social\r\ndevelopment Paraguay has established a special\r\ncommission to prepare for the Fourth World Conference\r\non Women, to be held at Beijing. The commission brings\r\ntogether State and private bodies, which are drafting a\r\nfinal report on the situation of women in Paraguay.\r\nAs a full member of the General Agreement on\r\nTariffs and Trade (GATT), Paraguay hopes that the\r\nresults of the Uruguay Round will have beneficial effects\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nfor us. We are convinced that the Uruguay Round is the\r\nbeginning of a process of downscaling policies of subsidy\r\nand protectionism. Paraguay confidently looks forward to\r\nthe follow-up to GATT and to the work of its\r\ncomplementary successor body, the World Trade\r\nOrganization.\r\nParaguay fully shares in the entire international\r\ncommunity’s anguish at drug trafficking, and at the evil\r\neffects of that phenomenon. Notwithstanding our meagre\r\nresources, we are doing whatever is necessary to root it out\r\nwherever it is hiding, and to fight it head on. But, with the\r\nstrength derived from reason, Paraguay affirms that the\r\nconsumer countries, transit countries and producer countries\r\nalike must undertake an equal commitment to adopting\r\nvigorous measures. Unilateral efforts, however vigorous, to\r\ncombat drug production and trafficking can never be\r\nsuccessful without gradual shrinkage of the markets that\r\ngive rise to production and trafficking in the first place.\r\nLinked with this universal scourge, which we condemn\r\nwith all our strength and conviction, is the phenomenon of\r\ncorruption, a human failing that is seen in varying degrees\r\nin all four corners of the Earth. Corruption spreads its\r\ntentacles as a reflection of a civilization that is prodigious\r\nin economic, financial, scientific, technical and industrial\r\nterms but is, we must admit, often found wanting in the\r\nfirm ethical underpinnings and the genuine human values\r\nthat strengthen and give vitality to a culture.\r\nParaguay is following with great attention all United\r\nNations efforts with respect to agenda item 142, \"Measures\r\nto eliminate international terrorism\". Recent grave events\r\nin certain parts of the world, indeed on our own continent,\r\nclearly show that the international community needs a new\r\napproach, through well-coordinated action, to overcoming\r\nthis serious problem, which, as we know, sometimes links\r\ndrug-trafficking mafias with terrorism.\r\nOn the question of equitable representation on and an\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council,\r\nParaguay believes that in today’s changing world we must\r\nattune the Organization to the requirements of the times and\r\ncurrent circumstances. Hence, my country believes it just\r\nto democratize the representation of States on the Security\r\nCouncil, and for the Council’s decision-making to be\r\ntransparent. The world situation has changed, and the\r\nUnited Nations must adapt to those changes. We repeat\r\nwhat we said at the last meeting of the Rio Group -\r\nnamely, that\r\n\"because of its legal tradition and its contribution to\r\nthe cause of peace, the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean region must be considered in any\r\nexpansion of the Security Council\".\r\nParaguay also firmly supports parallel efforts to\r\nrevitalize the functioning of the General Assembly.\r\nI want to mention and to highlight our great\r\nsatisfaction at the obvious, sustained advance of\r\ndemocracy in Latin America, and at the consolidation of\r\nthe various processes that are under way.\r\nWe should like to reaffirm that the United Nations\r\nmust continue to apply the principle of universality,\r\nmaking room within its ranks for all peace-loving States\r\nthat meet the requirements as set forth in the Charter and\r\nthat are prepared to honour its principles and purposes.\r\nWe believe that the entry of the Republic of China as an\r\nindependent country should be considered, along with the\r\ncase of any other State that meets the conditions I have\r\njust mentioned.\r\nI should like officially to declare that, on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\r\nParaguay pledges even now to have its President take part\r\npersonally in the session of the Assembly. The President\r\nof our Republic will make the voice of my homeland\r\nheard on that most welcome occasion.\r\nMeanwhile, my country has established an ad hoc\r\ncommission on the commemoration of that major event.\r\nThe environment, the subject of the magnificent\r\n1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is a matter of the\r\ngreatest concern to Paraguay, which is prepared to\r\nsupport any and all initiatives aimed at preserving the\r\nenvironment through sustainable development, as well as\r\nto enact any appropriate measures that do not undermine\r\neconomic growth.\r\nBy the same token, Paraguay declares its deep\r\nconcern at the situation affecting the Pilcomayo River,\r\nwhich is an international waterway inasmuch as its source\r\nis in Bolivia and it forms the border between Argentina\r\nand Paraguay.\r\nWe are now facing a major environmental problem\r\nsince that international river springs from the mountains\r\nand is now growing shallower in its course because of\r\nsedimentation build-up. Moreover, the Pilcomayo, owing\r\nto works undertaken on Argentine territory, has had some\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\n70 per cent of its volume absorbed in the territory of our\r\nneighbour. These facilities are doing a great deal of\r\ndamage to the Chaco region of Paraguay, especially to its\r\nlivestock and to the population.\r\nParaguay hopes that matters will return to normal, that\r\nis, that the course of the Pilcomayo River will resume its\r\nbalance, irrigating both border areas in an equitable way.\r\nWe fully trust that we will manage to reach complete\r\nagreement with the Republic of Argentina to restore this\r\nbalance at the earliest possible time.\r\nTo that end, we will have to go to the very source of\r\nthe Pilcomayo to seek a rational and comprehensive\r\nsolution which, inevitably, will require a trilateral\r\nagreement in the form of a law governing the confluence of\r\ninterests of Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay in respect of\r\nthe river’s course.\r\nAs Paraguay is a land-locked country, it has an\r\nespecially keen interest in the Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea, which our country ratified as early as 1986. The\r\nprovisions of the Convention allow for the mitigation of\r\ndisadvantages for those States that have no direct access to\r\nthe sea and, for Paraguay, this will open up the possibility\r\nof sharing in the wealth of the deep seabed, or \"Zone\",\r\nwhich the Convention calls the common heritage of\r\nmankind. We view with optimism the entry into force of\r\nthat Convention on 16 November this year. In the same\r\ncontext, Paraguay has signed the Agreement amending the\r\nConvention.\r\nAll developing countries aspire to sharing in the\r\nscientific and technological progress of the modern world.\r\nIt seems to me that, together with the other measures the\r\nUnited Nations has already taken or is preparing to take,\r\nserious thought should be given to creating a global fund\r\nfor scientific and technological development that would\r\ndeepen the relationship between the major research centres\r\nin developed countries and the universities and research\r\ncentres in developing countries.\r\nI should like to express Paraguay’s deep satisfaction\r\nat the demise of the apartheid regime in the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa and at the observance of human rights for all\r\nthe ethnic communities of the country. Paraguay has not\r\nforgotten the sister nations in Africa, which are striving to\r\novercome immense difficulties in their quest for sustainable\r\ndevelopment and which deserve wide international support.\r\nParaguay is similarly disposed towards the sister\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with which we enjoy\r\nfraternal ties. We wish its people peace and brotherhood,\r\nand will strive to commit the United Nations towards that\r\nend.\r\nWe are very pleased to congratulate the State of\r\nIsrael, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the\r\nKingdom of Jordan on their having strengthened the\r\nfoundations of fraternal and constructive coexistence in\r\nthe region, initiated in the agreements between Israel and\r\nEgypt. We trust that, given the help of the United\r\nNations and of other major actors, the peace and security\r\nprocess in that part of the world will make steady\r\nprogress, with the cooperation of other major countries in\r\nthe region itself.\r\nI should like to voice a few thoughts with regard to\r\nthe recent Conference on Population and Development in\r\nCairo. Paraguay joined in the Conference Declaration\r\nand Programme of Action, while clearly and explicitly\r\nplacing on record its demand for the defence of life and\r\nagreeing, in broad terms, with consensual and voluntary\r\nfamily planning. For that reason, Paraguay lodged two\r\nreservations similar to those expressed by other countries\r\nthat share our view.\r\nAs I bring my statement to a close, allow me to\r\nvoice a personal reflection that arises from my many\r\nyears in international life. I have been active in\r\ndiplomacy since 1936. Apart from some time spent in\r\nacademia, I have served my country or the United\r\nNations. I lived through the beginning and the end of the\r\nSecond World War. My generation was indeed moved\r\nwhen the United Nations Charter was signed. We were\r\nfilled with hope, and the world seemed to be on the right\r\npath in reordering its affairs. We have travelled a long\r\nway since then, but we remain all the more convinced of\r\nthe crucial need for this world Organization.\r\nI have personally known each one of the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral of our Organization. I have worked closely with\r\na number of them and shared their problems, their fears\r\nand their concerns as we struggled for a more just world.\r\nIt has been a privilege to be both a United Nations\r\nofficial and a diplomat accredited to this Organization.\r\nNow, in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I\r\nfeel I have been granted an opportunity to renew the\r\ncommitment of my nation and my own personal\r\ncommitment. That commitment is genuine and\r\nunadulterated support for the effort to keep the peace\r\nthrough law and to build it through development.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nThe United Nations ideal today compels us to adopt a\r\nnew way of thinking and living. Indeed, we are not merely\r\nrepresentatives of sovereign States or members of a world\r\nOrganization. We are protagonists and agents who share\r\nthe same planet, which is in many respects both very\r\nsimilar and very different.\r\nWe have to show greater solidarity and regain our\r\nuniversal vision.\r\nAs human beings, we all have an interest in whatever\r\nmakes us more human, in all senses of the term. The vital\r\nforce that springs from this vision helps us in our mission\r\nof saving our common home, the Earth.\r\nMankind and the Earth: therein lies the key\r\nmotivation for our commitment and for our endeavours,\r\nbeneath the majestic gaze of the Creator.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nnext on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ablassé Ouédraogo.\r\nMr. Ouédraogo (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The honour and the duty of presiding over the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly have been\r\nentrusted to you, Mr. President, and, through you, to your\r\ncountry, Côte d’Ivoire. Burkina Faso and all of Africa are\r\nmoved by this signal honour.\r\nBeyond the legitimate pride experienced by my\r\ndelegation, I should like to reaffirm our full readiness to\r\nassist you. Your wealth of diplomatic experience, together\r\nwith your professional and human qualities, will ensure the\r\nsuccess of our deliberations.\r\nYou have succeeded Ambassador Samuel Insanally of\r\nGuyana, who, with discretion and professionalism,\r\ndetermination and logical organization, guided a forty-\r\neighth session that was rich in ideas, initiatives and various\r\nkinds of fruitful contacts. We thank him for this.\r\nThe Secretary-General of our Organization,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has consistently and\r\ncourageously continued both in word and in deed to chart\r\na course designed to reaffirm the mission of the\r\nOrganization and to participate in defining the present and\r\nfuture spheres of action of the international community.\r\nIndeed, vision, courage and patience are virtues of\r\nwhich our world is in dire need. We have moved from the\r\nstatic certainties of the international environment of less\r\nthan a decade ago to the daily, fluid and dangerous\r\nuncertainties that surround us and sometimes overwhelm\r\nus, and there is an urgent need to find, or to recover, a\r\nreliable compass and collective will and solidarity.\r\nHowever, we have been witnessing a disintegration\r\nof the old order. We must indeed note that the post-cold-\r\nwar period has been characterized by the simultaneous\r\nemergence of heated conflicts that pit nations against each\r\nother or rend apart their integral elements. From Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina to Rwanda, the causes and means may\r\ndiffer more or less noticeably, but the immediate\r\nconsequence is always identical: the enormous suffering\r\nof peoples.\r\nDuring the forty-seventh session of our General\r\nAssembly, Burkina Faso stated:\r\n\"In their millions, people are cast out into a life of\r\nwandering; children are robbed of their childhood,\r\nand of their adolescence too; a future without hope\r\nis already the lot of a growing number of people\r\ncaught in the crossfire between one world that is\r\ndying and another that is being born.\" (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Forty-seventh\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 21st meeting, p. 86)\r\nAfrica continues to be shaken by upheavals and\r\ncrises of all sorts, and particular attention should be paid\r\nto them.\r\nWith regard to Angola, Burkina Faso welcomes the\r\npresent efforts aimed at implementing the Peace\r\nAgreements and supports Security Council resolutions 864\r\n(1993) and 932 (1994). We urge UNITA to negotiate\r\nwith greater firmness and thus allow the Lusaka meeting\r\nto yield the hoped-for results for peace and the well-being\r\nof the people of Angola as well as of the subregion.\r\nAs to Mozambique, it is our hope that the holding of\r\nfree and democratic elections this month will put an end\r\nto so many years of confrontation and will further commit\r\nthis brotherly country to a course of reconstruction and\r\nnational reconciliation for development and peace.\r\nWe hope that a solution can be found in Western\r\nSahara within the framework of a referendum whose\r\nterms of reference will be accepted by all.\r\nWe welcome the fact that in Burundi progress is\r\nbeing made in the process begun and supported both by\r\nthe United Nations and by the Organization of African\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nUnity (OAU), and we hope that the election of the\r\nPresident of the Republic on 30 September 1994 will make\r\npossible positive developments in this situation very soon.\r\nBurkina Faso, within the framework of the OAU, is making\r\nits contribution to this process.\r\nIn Liberia, because of the lack of confidence among\r\nthe parties, neither the demobilization nor the disarmament\r\nprovided for in the Cotonou Agreement has fully taken\r\nplace. These measures had been advocated to bring about\r\nan atmosphere propitious to the establishment of democratic\r\ninstitutions. Burkina Faso continues to support the Cotonou\r\nAgreement of 25 July 1993 as well as the Akossombo\r\nagreement of 12 September last.\r\nIn Somalia, far from the cameras and the media, the\r\ntragedy that was so widely reported by those media two\r\nyears ago continues. The same players are pursuing the\r\nsame conflict just as chaotically and relentlessly, without\r\nany sign of the will to put an end to it through dialogue and\r\nnegotiation.\r\nIn Rwanda, the unspeakable tragedy that has combined\r\ngenocide with intransigence has showed the international\r\ncommunity its limits and the procrastination of which it has\r\nbeen guilty. After having hastily decided on a withdrawal\r\nduring the first weeks of April 1994, the international\r\ncommunity, responding to the clamorous indignation of\r\npublic opinion, was forced to review its position and find\r\na way to return to the scene of the tragedy and attempt to\r\nlimit its shameful and disastrous development. We should\r\nlike here to thank those who have wished to confine the\r\nirreparable and immeasurable damage within the limits of\r\nthe restored human conscience. Without an active policy\r\nof reconciliation and national reconstruction, it is difficult\r\nto envisage a calm and stable future for that brotherly\r\ncountry. In this task, which is enormous in all respects, the\r\nGovernment of Rwanda will need all the assistance that can\r\npossibly be given it in a clear-sighted, responsible and\r\ncommitted manner. For its part, Burkina Faso, insofar as\r\nit is able, will tirelessly continue to make its contribution to\r\nRwanda.\r\nAnnoyance, irritation and understandable fatigue now\r\nhold sway in the Security Council in its consideration of the\r\nquestions of Liberia and Somalia; indeed, it is even\r\nthinking about leaving those two brotherly countries to their\r\nown devices. The reasoning put forward for this is that in\r\nan environment marked by a plethora of requests for\r\nmaterial, financial and human resources, it is impossible to\r\ncontinue to deal with protagonists who prefer war to the\r\nloss of a power that has not yet truly even been achieved.\r\nIt is true that peace cannot be imposed anywhere.\r\nBurkina Faso is aware of this and experiences it\r\nevery day as President Blaise Compaoré, putting these\r\nconvictions into practice, engages in subregional\r\nmediation and thus makes his contribution to the great\r\nAfrican plan for the necessary and indispensable\r\nintegration of our continent.\r\nPeace thus must be unremittingly pursued. And the\r\ntask of diplomats is to work to find acceptable and viable\r\nterms.\r\nShould we then leave all those areas of conflict to\r\ntheir own devices? The answer to this question will tell\r\nus more about all of us than about the protagonists of\r\nthose crises.\r\nIn Asia and Latin America, the conflict situations\r\nwith which our Organization is dealing are moving in a\r\ndirection which gives us reasonable hope to see a\r\nsettlement very soon. We encourage Kuwait and Iraq to\r\nrespect resolution 833 (1993) of the Security Council.\r\nWe are also encouraging dialogue between the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Republic\r\nof Korea, as well as negotiations between the United\r\nStates of America and the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea on the nuclear issue.\r\nBurkina Faso has welcomed and hailed the signing\r\non 13 September 1993 of the historic agreement on the\r\nDeclaration of Principles between President Arafat and\r\nPrime Minister Rabin, and also the signature on 4 May\r\n1994 of the Agreement on Gaza and Jericho. Burkina\r\nFaso urges that this policy be pursued.\r\nThe first democratic elections have taken place in\r\nSouth Africa. The South African people now have\r\nleaders that they have freely elected. We once again hail\r\nthe eminence of President Mandela, as well as the merits\r\nof Vice-President De Klerk, for having been able,\r\ntogether with the people of South Africa, to lead South\r\nAfrica towards a democratic and non-racial society. Here\r\namong us at last in the United Nations, South Africa will\r\nbe able to play and fully shoulder its role in the\r\ncommunity of nations, thus strengthening that principle of\r\nuniversality that we supported in a recent initiative\r\nconcerning the Republic of China.\r\nAll of this indicates the extent to which political\r\nupheavals affect, sometimes in an extraordinary fashion,\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nthe lives of men, women and children on all continents.\r\nHowever, to use an expression that was used four years ago\r\nduring the World Summit for Children, the world continues\r\ninexorably to witness a \"silent emergency\" that is still going\r\non and is growing.\r\nThe global economy has experienced a recession that\r\nhas more brutally and heartlessly affected the developing\r\ncountries. This state of affairs has exacerbated situations of\r\ninjustice and flagrant inequality. The improvement of the\r\neconomic climate of the developing countries hinges on the\r\ngrowth of financial investment flows, on the transfer of\r\ntechnology, on the elimination of tariff and non-tariff\r\nbarriers, on just remuneration for commodities and raw\r\nmaterials. This is not new, and it will be reiterated as long\r\nas the developing countries do not have a greater say\r\nconcerning the processes and machinery for decision-\r\nmaking relating to all these questions.\r\nThis is why an agenda for development is now urgent\r\nand of the highest priority. This agenda should put forward\r\nspecific measures for implementation focused on growth\r\nand development, and integrate the strategies and plans for\r\naction negotiated and adopted during the United Nations\r\nconferences. From Rio to Cairo, it has been possible to\r\nobtain consensus, but what is still missing are the new and\r\nadditional resources with which to implement the decisions\r\ntaken. In this connection, we hope that the implementation\r\nof the International Convention to Combat Desertification,\r\nsigned in Paris on 14 and 15 October 1994, will not also\r\nsuffer from this lack.\r\nWhile the developing countries are fulfilling their\r\nshare of commitments, the developed countries are balking\r\nat making their contributions. This is notably affecting the\r\nconcept and the implementation of global partnership,\r\nwhich was so highly praised at the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development.\r\nWe fear that, as regards the use made of their results,\r\nthese Conferences have only been understood in terms of\r\ntheir theme, without taking account of development. If\r\nthese comments are harsh, reality is even more so.\r\nProblems build up while financial resources dry up.\r\nThe eradication of poverty, in such a context, will be\r\ndifficult to bring about and will have fewer chances for\r\nsuccess. The commitment undertaken by the developed\r\ncountries to allocate 0.7 per cent of their GNP to public\r\nassistance for development has not always been respected,\r\nexcept by a few of them.\r\nAfrica, more than the other continents, is in a\r\nsituation that is critical and recognized as such by the\r\nUnited Nations. However, from the Programme of Action\r\nof the United Nations for the Economic Recovery and\r\nDevelopment of Africa in 1986, to the New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, adopted in 1991,\r\nnothing concrete has given concrete form to that\r\ncommitment by the international community.\r\nOver the last ten years, the African debt has been\r\ndiscussed ad infinitum, without, however, being reduced\r\nor eliminated to an extent likely to allow Africa to\r\nrelaunch its economy and structure its markets. Several\r\nof our partners have made efforts, and we note the\r\ndecision of the Group of Seven in Naples to expand the\r\nTrinidad Conditions to the performing African countries.\r\nIf this is a step in the right direction, it is not\r\nsufficient in a context where, as I said earlier, the\r\ndeterioration of the terms of trade and the loss of\r\npreferential markets are increasing the burden of the debt.\r\nWe therefore support the efforts of the Secretary-General\r\naimed at establishing a fund for diversification, and we\r\ncall upon the partners of Africa to play an active and\r\npositive role in establishing this fund.\r\nIn April 1994, the signing in Marrakesh of the\r\nAgreements of the Uruguay Round opened a new chapter\r\nin international trade relations, more or less establishing\r\nthe marginalization of Africa, which had already been\r\nevident throughout the negotiations. We hope that the\r\nrecently created World Trade Organization will be able to\r\nparticipate in the creation of a multilateral system of trade\r\nbased on applicable, non-discriminatory relations, and that\r\nin particular it will take account of the interests of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nOn the basis of a concern for independence and for\r\nthe integration of the global economy, access to resources,\r\nmarkets and technology, preferential assistance and\r\ncompensation measures must be open to the developing\r\ncountries. The spirit of this new configuration should not\r\nbe motivated by charity but rather by the awareness that\r\ncertain measures must be taken to ensure that the\r\ndevelopment of the world in partnership and solidarity\r\ntakes place harmoniously. It is in the interest of all of us.\r\nThe forthcoming World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, therefore, should emphasize man’s needs\r\nand put man at the centre of development and of\r\ninternational cooperation in drawing up the objectives and\r\nspecific commitments which we shall be undertaking. So\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\ntoo, the World Conference on Women to be held in Beijing\r\nwill have to continue that work of intensification begun in\r\nCairo during the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development: woman, the best agent for development.\r\nFor half a decade, the Member States of the United\r\nNations have been involved in a series of Conferences that\r\nculminated in an acknowledgment of the following facts.\r\nThe right to development exists. It must be reflected in\r\nreality. It is part of human rights. Development is possible\r\nonly in peace, and peace itself can be maintained only\r\nthrough development. Democracy and development,\r\ntherefore, are linked.\r\nOne after the other, the representatives who have\r\nspoken have emphasized the role of the United Nations.\r\nThe Organization is the most valuable multilateral\r\ninstrument available to nations. It is important that we give\r\nit the means to fulfil our ambitions and our projects.\r\nThe times have compelled us to confine ourselves to\r\nfinding the answers that must be found for the urgent\r\nsituations threatening the lives of human beings. Peace-\r\nkeeping operations currently face unprecedented complexity\r\nand difficulty. We salute and thank the 73 nations that are\r\noffering their sons and their resources for the purpose of\r\nextinguishing flames kindled throughout the world by man’s\r\nintransigence and madness.\r\nApart from the question of urgency, there are\r\npriorities. If these are understood and dealt with, the\r\nemergency situations of tomorrow and beyond will be\r\neased, and we shall come closer to having a more stable,\r\nless unjust and more harmonious world.\r\nA review of the United Nations system - the role,\r\nnature and place of the Security Council and of the General\r\nAssembly - is one of the urgent priorities that must be\r\naddressed if we are not to harm the future. It will become\r\never more difficult to wish for democracy in the world if\r\ndemocracy is avoided in the functioning and activity of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nA year from now we shall be celebrating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of this Organization. The profusion,\r\ncomplexity and simultaneousness of problems relentlessly\r\nassail societies and nature. Mankind will be able to face\r\nthese challenges and difficulties only by assuming and\r\naccepting our complementarity and our interdependence. It\r\nis that initiative and that momentum which will renew our\r\nbond with the ideals proclaimed 49 years ago in a\r\ndocument signed in San Francisco, which we call the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nLet us, therefore, be an Organization of truly united\r\nnations. This is possible only if there is a spirit of\r\njustice, peace and solidarity.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guinea, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kozo Zoumanigui.\r\nMr. Zoumanigui (Guinea) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): It is a pleasure for me to speak for the first\r\ntime in the General Assembly and to convey to its\r\nmembers the warm greetings of the people and the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Guinea.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to convey to\r\nyou, Sir, heartfelt congratulations on your notable election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\nninth session. It is an honour to your country, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, and to us the citizens of Guinea it is a fitting\r\nreflection of the trust that the international community\r\nplaces in the continent of Africa. I am convinced that\r\nyour wisdom and your qualities as an experienced and\r\ncompetent diplomat will ensure the success of our work.\r\nMy delegation assures you of its full support.\r\nI should also like to congratulate your predecessor,\r\nMr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who conducted the\r\nbusiness of the forty-eighth session in such a masterly and\r\nintelligent manner.\r\nI want also to pay well-deserved tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the\r\ntireless efforts he has made and the determination he has\r\nshown since his election to achieve the noble objectives\r\nassigned to the United Nations. His devotion to peace\r\nand the promotion of international cooperation at a time\r\nmarked by many complex changes guarantees the\r\nOrganization’s victory over the challenges facing\r\nhumanity.\r\nMr. Eltinay (Sudan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nMy Government welcomes South Africa’s long-\r\nawaited return to this Organization following the\r\ndismantling of apartheid and the holding of the first\r\nmultiracial, pluralist elections.\r\nThe forty-ninth session is being held at a time that\r\nis very favourable for the strengthening of international\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nrelations, thanks to more constructive dialogue. However,\r\na quick look at the international scene shows that we are\r\nstill far from the ideal of peace. Indeed, as soon as the\r\nbells of peace announced the end of the cold war the evil\r\nspirits were awakened. Here and there warlords are stirring\r\nup tension, bringing tragedy to innocent victims - in\r\nparticular, the elderly, women and children.\r\nIn Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia, Bosnia, Afghanistan and\r\nAngola - to refer to just some countries - killing, rape and\r\ndestruction are going on. We are all concerned, yet we all\r\nseem to be powerless.\r\nIt is regrettable that most of this tragedy is being\r\nplayed out in Africa, a continent already sorely tried by\r\neconomic crises, natural disasters and forced migration.\r\nMy delegation believes that the international community as\r\na whole, and this Organization in particular, should act with\r\ngreater firmness and unity to put an end to this tragic\r\nsituation.\r\nFor five years now, fratricidal conflicts have plunged\r\nLiberia into chaos and desolation. This conflict’s damaging\r\nconsequences for neighbouring States have become\r\nunbearable. Despite the efforts of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity and the international community to secure the\r\neffective implementation of the many peace plans, the latest\r\nof which is the Akosombo, Ghana, plan, the crisis\r\ncontinues. My Government makes an urgent appeal to the\r\ninternational community to become more energetically\r\ninvolved in the quest for a final solution to this conflict.\r\nOther regions of the world too are experiencing the\r\nsame difficulties that threaten international peace and\r\nsecurity. The Government of Guinea encourages the United\r\nNations to continue its efforts to restore peace, and urges\r\nthe parties to various conflicts to demonstrate wisdom by\r\nchoosing dialogue.\r\nI am thinking in particular of the situations in the\r\nMiddle East and on the Korean peninsula. Once again,\r\nonly a proper political approach, taking account of the\r\nspecific values of the parties concerned and of the political\r\nand material needs of the populations, will produce the\r\nconditions for lasting peace.\r\nI welcome the positive developments in the Middle\r\nEast, exemplified by the peace agreement signed in\r\nWashington between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization and also that signed between Israel and\r\nJordan. These agreements constitute in many respects\r\nimportant milestones in the recognition of the inalienable\r\nrights of the Palestinian people, and they offer hope for\r\na lasting and comprehensive peace in that region.\r\nBy the same token, the Government of Guinea\r\nencourages the two Korean States to continue their effort\r\nfor the independent and peaceful reunification of their\r\ncommon homeland. I have every hope that the\r\nnegotiations between the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States will lead the two parties to\r\ncontinue the dialogue to bring about a peaceful solution\r\nto the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula and to\r\nimprove relations between the two countries.\r\nThe tragic events that have shaken the political life\r\nof Haiti for three years now have captured the attention\r\nof the international community. My Government hopes\r\nthat the efforts of the international community will make\r\nit possible to put an end to that crisis and to alleviate the\r\nsuffering of the people of Haiti through the restoration of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThe remarkable progress made through the bilateral\r\nand multilateral negotiations in the field of disarmament\r\nand arms control clearly underscores the determination of\r\nMember States to shield our planet from the spectre of\r\ndestruction. However, many perils still hamper our\r\nefforts to bring about collective security, which would\r\nencompass the related problems of development,\r\nenvironment and human rights. In certain sensitive\r\nregions, the trade in conventional weapons and their\r\nfrequent use in conflicts, along with the trade in nuclear\r\nmaterials and the desire of some countries to possess\r\nnuclear weapons, add to our Organization’s\r\nresponsibilities and call for stringent verification\r\nmeasures. Objectives in this field should include a\r\nnuclear test ban and the promotion of the establishment of\r\ndenuclearized or nuclear-free zones in all parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nIn this brief overview of some of the major issues in\r\nthe world, I wish to stress the importance of peace-\r\nkeeping operations. I consider it useful to rethink the\r\nproblems of such operations, whose motives and\r\nprocedures for implementation seem very often to involve\r\ndouble standards. We believe that in order to give them\r\nthe desired legitimacy and effectiveness these operations\r\nshould be the subject of coordination and dialogue in\r\nwhich all United Nations Member States take part, for\r\ncollective security is the business of all nations of the\r\nworld, be they large or small.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nAfrica’s keen interest in the quest for ways and means\r\nto guarantee peace, security and stability on our continent\r\nis reflected in the mechanism for the prevention, settlement\r\nand management of conflicts established by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity. This instrument is already\r\nfunctioning; it deals with all forms of crisis that might\r\njeopardize African peoples’ efforts at economic, social and\r\ncultural development. A peace fund has been set up to give\r\nfinancial support to the actions undertaken by this\r\nmechanism.\r\nWhile appreciating the efforts of the United Nations in\r\nthe economic and social fields, we note with regret the\r\nabsence of any significant results in the implementation of\r\nthe measures adopted. Today we are concerned to see that\r\ninequalities in international trade are worsening and that\r\ndebt-servicing, which is a burden on the meagre resources\r\nobtained from structural adjustment, require bold action.\r\nFurthermore, the debt burden neutralizes the mobilization\r\nof funding for commodity exports, which are constantly\r\ndepreciating because of inequitable terms of trade.\r\nIn my delegation’s view, there can be no development\r\nif there is not an increase in income from commodities,\r\nwhose prices, unfortunately, are not controlled by the\r\ndeveloping countries. The quest for prosperity could be a\r\ndanger, since it engenders a strong migratory flow from the\r\nSouth to the North.\r\nDespite the socio-economic changes carried out in our\r\nStates to stimulate private initiative and cooperative\r\nmovements and to improve living conditions, the African\r\ncontinent is still experiencing an unprecedented economic\r\ncrisis. To this precarious picture we must add the\r\nresurgence of social problems, such as juvenile\r\ndelinquency, illicit trade in drugs and narcotics,\r\nunemployment, the AIDS pandemic and the deleterious\r\neffects of persistent drought and other natural disasters. In\r\nthis context, we support the recommendations and decisions\r\nof the international Conference held in Tokyo on African\r\ndevelopment. Furthermore, my delegation urges the\r\ninternational community to increase official development\r\nassistance and requests the United Nations to give greater\r\nsupport to the laudable efforts of the African countries in\r\ntheir economic-recovery policies, in keeping with Article 55\r\nof the Charter.\r\nThe concept of development cannot be limited to the\r\neconomic dimension alone. It must necessarily take into\r\naccount social and cultural dimensions. As long as some\r\nare afraid of the progress of others, the myth of Sisyphus\r\nwill prevail and part of our globe will be for ever harnessed\r\nto the yoke. Only dialogue, tolerance and the elimination\r\nof poverty throughout the world will guarantee lasting\r\npeace and strengthen the unity and stability of nations.\r\nIn this regard we should stress the relevance of the\r\nSecretary-General’s Agenda for Development.\r\nHighlighting the many aspects of development and its\r\nconnection with peace, the environment, international\r\nsecurity and human rights, it is a reference document in\r\nour quest for solutions to the many economic difficulties\r\nfacing the developing countries. It has thus enriched our\r\ndiscussion on sustainable development.\r\nThe protection of basic human rights, the satisfaction\r\nof mankind’s needs, and social justice are central to my\r\ncountry’s concerns. My delegation welcomed the holding\r\nin Cairo of the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, and we hope that the work of the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women, to be held in\r\nBeijing in 1995, and that of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Copenhagen, will give in-\r\ndepth consideration to other complex aspects of this\r\nimportant subject.\r\nIn my country, the Republic of Guinea, we have\r\nundertaken an ambitious programme of political,\r\neconomic, cultural and social restructuring. The process\r\nof establishing democratic and liberal institutions will be\r\ntotally completed during the last quarter of this year with\r\nthe holding of legislative elections. In order to pay the\r\nprice of political and socio-economic liberalization, we\r\nneed, in addition to substantial financial assistance,\r\nconsiderable support and understanding from the entire\r\ninternational community.\r\nMember States are preparing to commemorate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. This important\r\nevent will offer an opportunity for us all to recall the very\r\nspecial circumstances that gave birth to our Organization\r\nand to pay a well-deserved tribute to the work of the\r\nfounding fathers.\r\nMy country is making great efforts to prepare for\r\nthis great event, and to this end a national organizational\r\ncommittee has been established.\r\nThe serious international problems to which I have\r\njust referred are a measure of the gravity of the\r\nchallenges facing mankind, as well as the responsibilities\r\nof the United Nations. Our Organization has gained\r\nundeniable prestige, because of its increased burdens in\r\nmanaging world affairs. Nevertheless, in order to become\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nmore effective, it needs to be restructured and revitalized.\r\nThis applies to the Security Council and the other main\r\nbodies.\r\nReforms must be based on the principle of equality of\r\nMember States, and must reflect a balance in the decision-\r\nmaking process between the various bodies of the system.\r\nThat is what is needed for the United Nations to succeed in\r\nits mission of maintaining international peace and security\r\nand promoting a balanced world economy.\r\nThe embryonic new international order, freed of all\r\nuncertainty and threats of instability, will emerge from such\r\na development.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Arabic): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic, His Excellency Mr. Somsavat\r\nLengsavad.\r\nMr. Lengsavad (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)\r\n(spoke in Lao; interpretation from French text furnished by\r\nthe delegation): First, I am very pleased to convey to the\r\nPresident my warmest congratulations on his election to\r\npreside over the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. His wide experience and knowledge of\r\ninternational affairs, his well-known wisdom and patience\r\nare guarantees of success in the many difficult tasks of this\r\nsession.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy appreciation to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of our Organization, for the praiseworthy efforts he\r\nhas made in the service of world peace and development.\r\nAware how heavy is his burden in this complex, fast-\r\nchanging time, we wish him every possible success in the\r\ndischarge of his lofty duties.\r\nThe present session of the General Assembly is taking\r\nplace at a time when the world situation is still undergoing\r\nvery complex changes. While the end of the bipolar era\r\nopened the door to dialogue and cooperation between\r\nStates, it did not usher in an era of peace, which the world\r\nso badly needs if it is to construct a sound world economy.\r\nIn some regions of Europe, Africa and Asia, religious,\r\nethnic, tribal and border conflicts, often of tragic\r\nproportions, are still raging, thus making the international\r\nsituation unstable and fragile. It therefore seems clear that\r\nit will be difficult to achieve a new world order in which\r\ntrue peace prevails and in which peoples and nations, large\r\nand small, powerful and weak, rich and poor, benefit. The\r\ninternational community should give more thought to this\r\nmatter and join together to build a new era of peace and\r\njustice, to which the peoples of the world have so long\r\naspired.\r\nIn Europe, the situation in the Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina is still tense. The risk of new military\r\nclashes between the various parties remains. It is our\r\nview that the parties to this painful conflict should\r\ndemonstrate wisdom and above all realism by concluding\r\na just and equitable political settlement as soon as\r\npossible, and thus contribute to the restoration of peace in\r\nthat country and in the entire region.\r\nIn Africa, after so many years of efforts, both within\r\nand outside the United Nations, the Republic of South\r\nAfrica is free at last. In a spirit of national reconciliation,\r\nthe parties concerned have managed to reach an\r\nunderstanding and to cooperate in the building of a\r\nunited, non-racial and democratic South Africa. We\r\ncontinue to believe that the people of South Africa, under\r\nthe wise leadership of President Nelson Mandela, will\r\nprove equal to the task of overcoming the obstacles that\r\nface them and begin the economic development of their\r\nbeloved land.\r\nStill in Africa, in Rwanda, we have seen\r\nunprecedented bloodshed. The Government and people\r\nof Laos strongly condemn the abominable carnage, which\r\nhas been described as genocide of an innocent population,\r\nand we call upon the parties to the conflict to take the\r\nnecessary steps to prevent such unacceptable crimes from\r\never happening again.\r\nThe world is following closely the disturbing\r\nhumanitarian situation in the Caribbean. In our view,\r\nthere should be a political solution to this complex\r\nsituation, through sincere dialogue between the parties\r\ndirectly concerned. The signing of the joint communiqué\r\nof 9 September 1994 by the Republic of Cuba and the\r\nUnited States of America to resolve the problem of the\r\nexodus of Cubans - the consequence of more than\r\n30 years of externally imposed economic constraints - is\r\nclear proof of this. That agreement, the fruit of long and\r\ndifficult negotiations between the two parties, constitutes\r\nan important first step in the settlement of their\r\ndifferences, which should contribute to strengthening\r\npeace, stability and cooperation in the region.\r\nIn Haiti, due to the animosities still keenly felt by\r\nthe partisans of the military regime and President\r\nAristide’s sympathizers, the political situation continues\r\nto be fragile and complex. We believe that, in the best\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\ninterests of the Haitian nation, it is time for the parties to\r\nshow great wisdom and begin the economic reconstruction\r\nof their beloved land.\r\nIn the Middle East, the autonomous interim Palestinian\r\nAuthority, established in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho\r\nregion, pursuant to the Declaration of Principles on interim\r\nautonomy arrangements, signed in Washington on\r\n13 September 1993, marked a new phase in the search for\r\na just and lasting comprehensive settlement of the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict. We welcome this new, crucial step, and\r\nhope that the parties to the conflict will do everything\r\npossible to achieve a comprehensive settlement, just and\r\nhonourable for all, within the framework of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nIn Western Asia, despite countless efforts exerted\r\ntowards a peaceful settlement of the conflict, Afghanistan\r\nremains the theatre of a bloody civil war. In conformity\r\nwith the recent statement of the President of the Security\r\nCouncil on 11 August 1994, we address an appeal to the\r\nparties concerned immediately to put an end to their\r\nhostilities, achieve national reconciliation and begin the\r\ndifficult reconstruction of their ravaged homeland.\r\nIn the Korean peninsula, after months of uncertainty,\r\ndialogue between the parties concerned has finally resumed.\r\nWe warmly encourage that dialogue and the Lao delegation\r\nwelcomes the conclusion of the Agreement signed in\r\nGeneva on 12 August 1994 between the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States of\r\nAmerica. Because of its importance everything should be\r\ndone to ensure that this sensitive region of the world\r\nbecomes a nuclear-weapon-free zone. In the interests of\r\npeace, stability and cooperation in that region as well as in\r\nthe world, it is essential that all the parties concerned show\r\nunderstanding and mutual trust in order to find a peaceful\r\nsolution to the issues between them.\r\nIn South-East Asia a new era of cooperation in areas\r\nof common interest between countries of the region has\r\ngrown ever stronger. The inauguration in April of the Lao-\r\nThai friendship bridge across the Mekong, built with\r\nfinancial assistance and cooperation from the Government\r\nand the people of Australia, is an especially salient event\r\nfor Laos, Thailand and Australia, as well as other countries\r\nof the region, in our efforts further to strengthen regional\r\ncooperation in different areas. In addition, the Heads of\r\nState or Government of our respective countries have\r\nregularly been exchanging visits with a view to expanding\r\nand deepening their friendship and cooperation in an\r\nextensive and fruitful field of cooperation. The\r\nparticipation of my country, once again, in the ministerial\r\nmeeting of the countries of the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) in July in Bangkok, Thailand,\r\nonce again demonstrates our sincere desire to cooperate\r\nin all possible areas with the countries of ASEAN, thus\r\nresponding to the desires and deep aspirations of the\r\npeoples of the region and the world.\r\nThe present situation in the Kingdom of Cambodia\r\nremains the subject of major world attention. As an\r\nimmediate neighbour, the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic, ardently wishes that the Cambodian people will\r\nbe able to live their lives in peace, in an atmosphere of\r\nnational reconciliation, and to work for the reconstruction\r\nof their homeland, which will thus contribute to the\r\nstrengthening of peace and cooperation in the region. To\r\nthat end we fully support the various measures that have\r\nbeen taken by the Cambodian Government, under the\r\nleadership of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom\r\nRanariddh, and His Excellency Mr. Hun Sen.\r\nIn Myanmar a new, important event has taken place.\r\nEfforts towards national reconciliation and the start of\r\neconomic cooperation with the outside world have been\r\nbearing their initial fruits, thus consolidating the stability\r\nof the country.\r\nIn the Lao People’s Democratic Republic we note,\r\nfortunately, that on the whole our economic performance\r\nhas been good. On the average, annual economic growth\r\nfor the past three years has been of the order of\r\n6 per cent to 7 per cent in real terms. The inflation rate\r\nhas not exceeded 10 per cent a year and exchange rates\r\ngenerally remain stable. No less importantly, foreign\r\ninvestment has considerably increased. At the present\r\ntime the Lao Government is exerting major efforts to\r\nachieve the goals set in its socio-economic development\r\nstrategy from now to the year 2000.\r\nThat strategy presented to the fifth round-table\r\nmeeting organized expressly for the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic in Geneva last June, under the\r\nsponsorship of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), was conceived as a realistic and\r\ntrustworthy document and has received broad support\r\nfrom participants. On behalf of the Lao Government and\r\npeople I wish to take this opportunity to express our\r\nsincere appreciation to the friendly countries, international\r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations for the\r\nassistance they have afforded us in the past in our efforts\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\ntowards national development and we hope to be able to\r\ncontinue to benefit from that assistance in various fields.\r\nThe world economy, far from improving, still faces an\r\nuncertain future. Marked by recession and imbalances, it\r\nalso suffers from grave structural problems. Developed\r\ncountries do not hesitate to take certain measures that run\r\ncounter to the legitimate interests of developing countries.\r\nBecause of the world economy’s interdependence it is\r\nimportant that developed countries undertake to cooperate\r\nwith the developing countries in order to restore the\r\neconomy and to promote development in the interests of all.\r\nIn that respect it is essential fully to honour commitments\r\nundertaken in support of international cooperation as they\r\nhave been set forth in resolutions of the General Assembly,\r\nin particular, the Declaration on International Economic\r\nCooperation, in particular the Revitalization of Economic\r\nGrowth and Development of the Developing Countries, the\r\nInternational Development Strategy for the Fourth United\r\nNations Development Decade and the resolutions of the\r\nconferences that have followed it.\r\nThe question relating to drug abuse and illicit\r\ntrafficking remains an issue of world concern. Aware of\r\nthe disastrous consequences that can result from this, the\r\nLao Government has taken vigorous measures to encourage\r\nthe population gradually to give up the poppy crop and to\r\nchoose other substitute crops, created a special unit against\r\ndrug abuse, and established cooperation with neighbouring\r\ncountries in order to make its contribution to the\r\ninternational fight against this scourge. As part of these\r\nefforts and with the assistance of the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNIDCP) this year\r\nwe have developed a comprehensive programme for drug\r\ncontrol. That programme, the cost of which is $35 million,\r\nconsists of setting up 16 projects, including the\r\nstrengthening of drug control administration, reduction of\r\nsupply through eradication of the poppy crop, a strategy for\r\ntreatment and rehabilitation, and the establishment of a\r\nspecial investigation unit. With assistance and cooperation\r\nfrom the international community we hope to be able to\r\nachieve the goal we pursue.\r\nThe advancement and defence of human rights is an\r\nimportant and sensitive question. Unanimously seen as\r\nuniversal, these rights, often having historical, cultural and\r\nreligious implications, are inseparable and interdependent.\r\nOn that note we welcome the creation of the post of High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and it is our hope that the\r\nHigh Commissioner will effectively discharge the very\r\nresponsible functions that have been assigned to him.\r\nThe world exists in an uncertain international\r\npolitical environment. In that context the United Nations,\r\nthe only universal multilateral forum, should have a\r\ncrucial role to play. Strengthened by the purposes and\r\nprinciples of its Charter, it is in a position to provide the\r\nnecessary framework for cooperation, dialogue among\r\nStates and the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn order to carry out its noble task effectively in this\r\nnew era, the United Nations must restructure and\r\ndemocratize itself. It is also most important that the\r\nUnited Nations give top priority to a programme of action\r\non development that could serve as a framework for\r\npromoting growth and economic development throughout\r\nthe world. We feel that, to be effective, any programme\r\nof action on development must be action-oriented and\r\nbased on a spirit of true international cooperation and\r\ninterdependence; above all, it must take into account the\r\nbasic legitimate interests of developing countries,\r\nespecially the least developed among them.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Arabic): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Albania,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alfred Serreqi.\r\nMr. Serreqi (Albania): Allow me at the outset to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Essy on his election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session and to\r\nwish him every success in discharging this noble duty.\r\nA well-deserved word of appreciation is due to his\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Insanally, for the remarkable\r\ncompetence and skill he displayed as President at the last\r\nsession.\r\nWe highly esteem the Secretary-General’s\r\nunreserved commitment, at the head of the world\r\nOrganization, to make broad reforms in it and to increase\r\nits effectiveness in all fields.\r\nAfter the fall of the iron curtain in Europe, Albania\r\njoined the family of democratic nations, leaving behind a\r\ndeep isolation and a totalitarian regime. In two years,\r\nthanks to the determination of the democratic Government\r\nto carry out profound and urgent reforms, Albania has\r\ntaken important steps in all fields. State institutions have\r\nbeen transformed, drawing upon the positive experience\r\nof developed States. The former secret service was\r\ndissolved and the army was placed under civilian control\r\nand underwent reform in compliance with the\r\nrequirements of a demilitarized, profoundly democratic\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nsociety. Today, Albania boasts an independent judiciary\r\nand a constitutional court which supervises the\r\nconstitutional character of the laws passed by Parliament.\r\nCurrently in Albania, there are more than 30 registered\r\npolitical parties, hundreds of non-governmental\r\norganizations, and more than 320 magazines and\r\nnewspapers, of which 90 per cent are privately owned. At\r\npresent, Albania’s religious communities practise their own\r\nbeliefs in exemplary harmony and tolerance, according to\r\nthe centuries-old traditions of my country.\r\nBy promoting democracy and strengthening the\r\ninstitutions of the rule of law, the democratic Government\r\nseeks to guarantee the country’s internal social and political\r\nstability. However, Albania continues to be the poorest\r\ncountry of the European continent and faces a series of\r\neconomic difficulties. By firmly pursuing the economic\r\npolicy of shock therapy, in cooperation with the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the international\r\ncommunity, the Government is implementing a series of\r\nshort- and medium-term programmes that have given a\r\ngreat impetus to free individual initiative. In two years’\r\ntime, agriculture, land, apartments, transport, services, trade\r\nand about 2,500 small and medium-sized enterprises have\r\nbeen privatized. From 400 per cent, the inflation rate has\r\ndropped to less than 30 per cent a year; the currency is\r\nstable and practically convertible; and production is on the\r\nrise. In 1993, Albania recorded growth rate of 11 per cent,\r\nthe highest in Europe. Foreign investments are also\r\nincreasing.\r\nIn the coming months we shall move ahead without\r\nlosing time. The nearest objectives in legislation are the\r\napproval of the new penal code, the penal procedure code\r\nand the constitution, which will meet most advanced\r\nEuropean standards. We will also try to increase\r\ncooperation with various international organizations,\r\nparticularly with the agencies of the United Nations system.\r\nAlbania attaches special importance to strengthening\r\nfriendly relations and cooperation with the international\r\ncommunity, the European Union, the United States of\r\nAmerica, the countries of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference and other friendly countries in the world.\r\nAlbania’s President Berisha is resolutely devoted to the\r\nestablishment and strengthening of these ties in order to do\r\naway, once and for all, with the bitter consequences of the\r\nsevere 50-year isolation which our people suffered. We\r\nwant to have friendly relations, especially with our\r\nneighbours, and we are making efforts so that a climate of\r\ngood understanding and cooperation, based on mutual\r\nrespect and benefit in the spirit of the basic principles of\r\nthe Helsinki Final Act, will prevail all around us. We\r\nhave established such relations with Italy and are on the\r\nway to their further and all-round development.\r\nWe would also like to have on a consistent basis the\r\nsort of good, tension-free relations we are currently\r\nenjoying with Greece, the only country of the Balkans\r\nthat is a member of the European Union. We regard\r\nthese relations, not merely as bilateral, but also as closely\r\nlinked to the prospect of the integration of Albania and\r\nthe Balkans into Europe. Advances are being made in the\r\nrelations of good-neighbourliness and broad cooperation\r\nwith Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, on the basis of a\r\nlong historical tradition.\r\nAs regards the new Balkan State, our eastern\r\nneighbour, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,\r\nwe are resolutely committed to building relations of\r\nexemplary neighbourliness with it and to helping that\r\ncountry overcome its internal and external difficulties.\r\nWe are convinced that its integrity, its internal stability,\r\nits recognition and its membership in all international\r\nforums are of vital importance for peace, security and\r\nstability in the region. Our indispensable good relations\r\nwith Macedonia are linked to and conditioned by the\r\npresence of an Albanian population that ranks second in\r\nsize to Macedonians. We think that sound interethnic\r\nunderstanding between Macedonians and Albanians,\r\nestablished on the basis of the due recognition of the\r\nAlbanians’ human and national rights, is indispensable for\r\nthe domestic stability and prosperity of that Republic and\r\nthe entire region.\r\nWe would like to have peace, good-neighbourliness\r\nand fruitful cooperation with Montenegro and Serbia, but\r\nthese relations will remain frozen and mortgaged to the\r\noverall solution of the Yugoslav crisis, especially the\r\npolitical settlement of the Kosovo issue. The Kosovo\r\nissue is not merely and solely a question of respect for\r\nthe human rights of the two million Albanian people and\r\nthe recognition of a few rights in the areas of education\r\nand culture. The question concerns recognition of the\r\npolitical self-governing entity of the Albanians, for which\r\nthe population of Kosovo has cast its vote in a democratic\r\nmanner.\r\nBelgrade should seriously consider this option. We\r\nconsider regional cooperation and integration an\r\nindispensable condition for our integration into Europe.\r\nWe have been making continuous efforts to promote\r\nunderstanding with our neighbours. For the further\r\npromotion of Albania’s democratic and economic changes\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nthere is a need for security and confidence in the Balkans.\r\nWe hold that the developed countries could contribute with\r\na full strategy and programme in order to encourage the\r\nradical democratic changes in the entire Balkan space, a\r\nkind of Marshall Plan designed to promote peace,\r\ndemocracy and modern civilization there, an economic-\r\npolitical programme for the all-round rehabilitation of the\r\nregion.\r\nNational and ethnic problems left over from the past,\r\nbackwardness in terms of economic and social\r\ndevelopment, and the new problems resulting from the\r\nchange of systems make it still possible for old political\r\nmentalities to dominate the stage of inter-Balkan relations.\r\nThose mentalities are opposed to true democratic\r\ndevelopments, even in the countries which call themselves\r\nancient democracies.\r\nAs a Balkan country, Albania is concerned about the\r\nwar and the crises that have encompassed our peninsula.\r\nWe are convinced that at the foundation of the present-day\r\nBalkan crisis lies the revival of aggressive nationalism,\r\nwhich has unfurled the banner of territorial annexationist\r\nclaims. The end of the cold war has again brought onto the\r\nscene the demons of old Balkan politics which seek a\r\nredrawing of the existing borders and the re-\r\ndismemberment of some States to the benefit of others.\r\nThe Milosevic regime’s opposition, through a bloody war,\r\nto the will of the peoples to break away from the former\r\nYugoslav Federation was the first challenge to the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the Helsinki\r\nFinal Act, while the dismembering of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina was the first act carried out in the name of\r\ncreating a hegemony-seeking Greater Serbia at the expense\r\nof this former republic of the Federation, a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations and of the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE).\r\nIn today’s Balkans the nations that consider\r\nthemselves more powerful and better armed are seeking to\r\nextend their territories through force and war in order to\r\nexpand their power. Expansion and aggressiveness inspire\r\ntheir policies towards their neighbours. National divisions,\r\ninterethnic hatred or religious diversity are encouraged and\r\nartificially provoked, and they are converted into major\r\nnational and international policy issues in an attempt to\r\ndisguise historically unfounded territorial claims. At the\r\nfoundation of what politicians today call \"ethnic conflicts\"\r\nin the Balkans lie the aggressive nationalism of a\r\nhegemony-seeking nation, racism and xenophobia, genocide\r\nand massive \"ethnic cleansing\". That is why we have often\r\ninsisted that any settlement that would legalize the\r\naccomplished fact of \"ethnic cleansing\" in Bosnia would\r\ncreate a dangerous precedent for new tragedies of this\r\nkind, starting in the Balkan region.\r\nToday, Serb and Greek nationalism are seriously\r\nthreatening the Balkans. Such elements consider that the\r\ncollapse of Communist dictatorships in the Balkans\r\ncreated a vacuum to be exploited to achieve their\r\nnationalist ambitions.\r\nHence, Serb nationalism launched an aggression in\r\nthe north and a war to realize a Greater Serbia by creating\r\na real holocaust at the end of this century against the\r\nBosnian people and by strengthening apartheid in Kosovo.\r\nThat nationalism is bogged down in grave crimes. In our\r\njudgement, only the intransigence of the international\r\ncommunity and the refusal to recognize the violation of\r\nthe principles that all of us have accepted will compel the\r\nSerbs in Belgrade, Pale and Knin to give up war as a\r\nmeans of solving problems. The dismemberment of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and the \"ethnic cleansing\" on its\r\nterritory are unacceptable. We have supported and still\r\nsupport the request of that Republic for the lifting of the\r\narms embargo against it, an embargo which - there is no\r\ndoubt - has been an encouragement to the aggressor.\r\nSimilarly, we support the recent Security Council\r\nresolutions 941 (1994) and 942 (1994), which we believe\r\nare steps in the right direction for putting an end to\r\nhostilities in the region. However, we are opposed to\r\nresolution 943 (1994), which is a concession to the\r\nMilosevic regime and makes a settlement of the Yugoslav\r\ncrisis and the establishment of general peace in the\r\nBalkans remote.\r\nI would like to recall that the crisis in the former\r\nYugoslavia started in Kosovo and that it persists there,\r\nalive and very dangerous. Sanctions against Belgrade\r\nshould not to be eased but should be further tightened and\r\ntruly implemented if we want the crisis hotbeds in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, in the occupied territories of Croatia,\r\nSandiak and Vojvodina, and especially in Kosovo to be\r\neliminated. The Albanian Government insists that the\r\nlifting of sanctions against Serbia be conditioned on the\r\nsettlement of the Kosovo issue.\r\nWe should be realists. It was not Milosevic’s\r\ngoodwill but the unanimous stand of the great Powers of\r\nthe Contact Group that recently made Belgrade announce\r\nan interruption of its aid to Serbian aggression in Bosnia\r\nand accept international monitoring of that act. On this\r\noccasion we should stress that these decisions are positive\r\nand welcome. They should be irreversible steps, for we\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nconsider that the future of peace and stability in the Balkans\r\nwill also depend, to a considerable extent, on a just\r\nsettlement of the Kosovo issue. Albanians in Kosovo have\r\nbeen deprived of all rights. Serb nationalism rejects\r\ndialogue. It is brandishing weapons and engaging in threats\r\nby the use of tanks; it is organizing police terror daily from\r\nvillage to village, from one city quarter to another. We\r\nhave insisted and still insist on carrying out a dialogue\r\nbetween Kosovo’s legitimate institutions and its leadership,\r\non the one hand, and Belgrade, on the other, in the\r\npresence of a third party, on the restoration of the\r\ndemocratic institutions that were abolished with the use of\r\ntanks and on the definition of a status that should include\r\nrecognition of the right to self-determination at an\r\nopportune moment. This is the only way, in our view, to\r\nreach an overall settlement of the Balkan crisis, which may\r\ngrow into conflicts far larger than previous ones unless it is\r\ntackled with proper determination and responsibility.\r\nGreek nationalism, too, is another growing threat to\r\nAlbania and the Albanians. It is seeking, through a series\r\nof manoeuvres, to block the reforms in Albania and to\r\ndestabilize it in an attempt to render the settlement of the\r\nAlbanian question more difficult and delay it. To facilitate\r\nthe position of its ally in the north, it is making territorial\r\nclaims against Albania.\r\nGreek nationalism is dangerous not only on account of\r\nits tradition but also because of the fact that it has the\r\nprivilege of being a somewhat forgotten nationalism. For,\r\nsince Greece is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) and of the European Union, there is\r\na tendency to ignore it. The truth is that Greece today, as\r\na member of NATO and the European Union, is subject to\r\na certain control by and dependence on those organizations,\r\nand this is a positive thing. However, it is also true that\r\nover the past two years Greek nationalism has blocked\r\naction by those institutions several times because of the\r\nconsensus needed to take decisions.\r\nToday, the establishment and progressive consolidation\r\nof positions in Greek official circles is a bitter fact. The\r\npower game that is taking place in Greece is undoubtedly\r\nbeing played through the free vote, but, in distinction to all\r\nthe other countries of Western Europe, it is being played\r\nwith nationalist slogans. It is an undeniable fact that after\r\nthe game is played official Greece will emerge more\r\nnationalistic than it was before. It is precisely for these\r\nreasons that Greece, the birthplace of democracy, our\r\nmillenary neighbour, avoided and gave up the opportunity\r\nto serve as a promoter of the integration of the Balkan\r\ncountries into Europe after the fall of the iron curtain. At\r\nthe same time, through its official and unofficial policy it\r\nbecame a true champion of Serb nationalism - not, of\r\ncourse, for the sake of Serbia’s interests but for the sake\r\nof interests and ambitions which it hopes to achieve by\r\nremaking the Balkans.\r\nWe do not mean that Greece can be compared to\r\nSerbia, for that would not be realistic. But what causes\r\ngreat concern is the progressively official character Greek\r\nnationalistic policy is assuming. It is the Greek\r\nGovernment which has blocked the recognition of\r\nMacedonia and has imposed a blockade on it, ignoring the\r\nfact that its border is also the border of the European\r\nUnion. It is Greek state nationalism that blocks European\r\nUnion aid to the poorest European country, Albania,\r\nrendering its economic growth more difficult. The\r\nMitsotakis Government officially demanded the autonomy\r\nof \"northern Epirus\", as they call the south of Albania;\r\nthe Papandreou Government declares that it has\r\nincorporated the south of our country in Greek defence\r\nplanning. The official character the Greek Government\r\nhas given to its policy on \"northern Epirus\" poses a\r\nserious threat to the Balkans.\r\nGreek nationalism is trying to manipulate about\r\n60,000 Greeks who live in the south of Albania -\r\naccording to the 1989 census, they comprise 1.85 per cent\r\nof the country’s population - as a means to destabilize\r\nAlbania and to achieve its annexationist designs. For this\r\npurpose, Greece is emitting organized, nationalistic and\r\nfundamentalist propaganda through radio stations,\r\nair-dropped leaflets and the distribution of materials\r\nwhich claim the south of Albania and demand the\r\noverthrow of the democratic Tirana Government. On 10\r\nApril 1994, an armed band was sent into Albania, where\r\nit killed two Albanian army men; hundreds upon hundreds\r\nof firearms have been smuggled into Greek minority\r\nvillages and young Greek minority people have been\r\nrecruited and sent to attend Greek military schools\r\nwithout the knowledge of the Albanian Government. The\r\nrecent verdict passed by an Albanian court on five\r\nAlbanian citizens of Greek origin on charges of collusion\r\nwith the Greek secret services, sending out military\r\nintelligence, the distribution and illegal possession of arms\r\nand so on, was exploited as an excuse to attack the\r\nAlbanian Government at all international institutions and\r\nforums, including this august Assembly, to block 35\r\nmillion ecu in European Union aid to Albania, to expel in\r\nretaliation 60,000 Albanian citizens who were legally\r\nemployed in Greece in a matter of a few weeks,\r\nmaltreating them, beating them up and killing six of them.\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Greek\r\nminority of Albania did not let itself fall prey to such a\r\nchauvinistic policy. The Greek minority expressed this\r\nstand openly two weeks ago during Albanian President Sali\r\nBerisha’s visit to Greek minority villages in the south of\r\nAlbania. All this has arisen because ethnic minorities in\r\nAlbania live in harmony with Albanians, and are not\r\nmaltreated by the Government. On the contrary, with the\r\nestablishment of the democratic regime, they are step by\r\nstep enjoying the most advanced standards as set forth in\r\nUnited Nations instruments, the Copenhagen Document and\r\nother international conventions on minorities. This has\r\nbeen confirmed by dozens of foreign observers, ethnic\r\nminority specialists, parliamentarians, representatives of\r\ninternational institutions, including the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) High\r\nCommissioner for ethnic minorities, Mr. Max van der Stoel,\r\nvarious non-governmental organizations, journalists and so\r\non.\r\nWith the establishment of the democratic regime in\r\nAlbania, members of the Greek minority are represented in\r\nor lead local organs of power; are represented in the\r\nAlbanian parliament in the ruling parties and the opposition\r\nparties, and even in a separate party; they are present at all\r\nlevels of the administration as ministers, ambassadors,\r\nmembers of the supreme court, and so on; they go to\r\nGreece freely and with no obstacles from the Albanian\r\nState; they learn or are taught in their mother tongue, and\r\na recent decision of the Albanian Government has created\r\nmore opportunities to extend this possibility; they have their\r\nown schools at all levels, a separate branch in the Greek\r\nlanguage at the Gjirokastra University, their own mass\r\nmedia, radio broadcasts and newspapers in the Greek\r\nlanguage, as well as their political and cultural\r\norganizations.\r\nThe Albanian Government has openly declared that the\r\ncrisis in its relations with Greece will in no way affect the\r\nharmonious relations between Albanians and members of\r\nthe Greek minority in Albania.\r\nOn the other hand, we call on the Greek Government\r\nto apply the international conventions relating to ethnic\r\nminorities. It cannot shirk its responsibility with its\r\nsenseless denial of the presence of national minorities in\r\nGreece. How could the Turkish, Macedonian and Albanian\r\nminorities vanish in Greece at a stroke? The Greek\r\nGovernment should put an end to the suffocating climate\r\nthat prevents these minorities from asserting their own\r\nnational identity.\r\nHow could the Greek Government forget the\r\n1944-1945 massacre of the Albanian population of\r\nChameria, when thousands upon thousands of people were\r\nstabbed to death and killed with firearms by Greek\r\nchauvinistic nationalists. And some of those who could\r\nescape alive, old folk and children, were expelled to\r\nAlbania and Turkey, thus creating a real tragedy of\r\ndivided families, whereas their land, homes and other\r\nproperty were usurped by Greek colonists, who still\r\npossess them today in contravention of international civil\r\nlaw.\r\nWe have always appreciated the importance of good\r\nrelations with Greece, free from any concern and tension,\r\nfor our development, peace and security. Because of the\r\nreasons already mentioned, this has not always worked\r\nout. We tried to overcome the present-day crisis in our\r\nrelations, provoked against our interest and will, through\r\ndialogue either on a bilateral footing or through\r\ninternational mediation. The Greek minority people in\r\nAlbania, too, have publicly supported unconditional\r\ndialogue between the two Governments. Unfortunately,\r\nthe Greek side has so far rejected a meeting of our two\r\ncountries’ Foreign Ministers, proposed by the Albanian\r\nside, as well as the mediation of the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General, the European Union presidency and\r\nthe United States Administration. On the contrary, they\r\nare still bringing pressure to bear on the democratic\r\nAlbanian Government.\r\nThe Albanian Government will continue to make\r\nevery effort to be constructive and strive for peace in its\r\npolicy towards its Balkan neighbours, aware of the fact\r\nthat the Balkans is one of the hottest and most dangerous\r\nspots in the world today, and therefore the attention of the\r\ninternational community should not be distracted from it.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress that we share\r\nthe view and join the efforts aimed at revising the Charter\r\nand structure of the United Nations, especially as it\r\nconcerns such important organs as the Security Council,\r\nwhich takes decisions on the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, in order to enhance their efficiency in\r\nresponse to today’s challenges in a fast-changing world.\r\nThe crisis the world is currently experiencing urgently\r\nraises the need to achieve consensus on such a\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council, so as to make this\r\nimportant decision-making body as representative and\r\ndemocratic as possible and even more effective in the\r\nadoption of decisions and their implementation. I take\r\nthis opportunity to reiterate the candidature of my country\r\nfor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council from\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nthe Eastern European Group for the 1996-1997 term. We\r\nthink that giving this seat to Albania after 40 years of\r\nmembership in the United Nations would also be an\r\nencouragement to small countries to assume the\r\nresponsibility incumbent upon them and commit themselves\r\nto safeguarding peace, security and world order.\r\nWe look confidently to the further enhancement of\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping activities. To this end,\r\nAlbania maintains that the United Nations needs an efficient\r\nmechanism to warn of conflicts in advance and to intervene\r\nin time in order to prevent their outbreak. We would like\r\nto stress the conclusion we have drawn from Bosnia’s\r\ntragic experience. We seriously believe that the tragedy\r\ncould have been averted if there had been serious attention\r\nby the United Nations when it recognized the secession and\r\nindependence of that Republic from the former Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. The military intervention Serbia\r\nperpetrated in order to halt more secessions from the\r\nfederation would have been avoided if the new Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina had been placed under the firm\r\nprotection of the United Nations.\r\nIt is never too late to draw lessons. We think that the\r\nUnited Nations should set up a modern system of\r\ntrusteeship that could be set in motion whenever necessary\r\nto prevent human catastrophes like that in Bosnia. Today,\r\nthis is dictated by the situation in Kosovo, which is very\r\nclose to posing a potential threat like that posed by Bosnia;\r\nit is dictated also by the situations in Rwanda, Somalia,\r\nHaiti and other places.\r\nAs we said last year, we are in favour of United\r\nNations intervention wherever there are clear signs, as\r\ndetermined by early-warning monitoring, of a threat of\r\nhuman catastrophe. As we all know, the consequences of\r\nsuch catastrophes have negative effects on regional and\r\ninternational peace and security. We hold that in such\r\ncases there is no reason for the Security Council to hesitate\r\nto take a decision on intervention without the prior consent\r\nof the State or Government that is the cause of and is\r\nresponsible for the catastrophe. Otherwise, such human\r\ncatastrophes will never be prevented, and international\r\npeace, security and stability will always be threatened.\r\nWhat we demand is in full compliance with the universally\r\naccepted idea, that it is easier to avoid a crisis or conflict\r\nthan to try to solve it after it has broken out.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Arabic): Before\r\ncalling on representatives who wish to speak in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply, let me remind members that statements\r\nin exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the\r\nsecond, and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Sreenivasan (India): The Foreign Minister of\r\nPakistan will not be surprised that his statement today has\r\nforced a reply from India. For Pakistan, as would have\r\nbeen obvious this morning, India is an obsession. For\r\nIndia, Pakistan’s histrionics are merely an annoying\r\ndistraction. We do not want the General Assembly’s trust\r\nto be abused by Pakistan as much as its patience has\r\nbeen, and I want therefore to place some facts on record.\r\nFirst, our offer of dialogue is open, and if Pakistan\r\nresponds, we will not need a third party either as broker\r\nor facilitator or umpire. Pakistan has refused to talk and\r\nis trying to create an impression that bilateralism has\r\nnever worked and that a threat to regional peace is\r\nimminent. This is not true. The Simla Agreement, which\r\nhas kept the peace between us for 23 years, was\r\nbilaterally negotiated. India continues to respect the letter\r\nand spirit of the Simla Agreement. Our troops are in\r\npeacetime locations. Bilaterally negotiated confidence-\r\nbuilding measures between India and Pakistan continue in\r\nplace, and neither country has had occasion in recent\r\nmonths or weeks to complain about their efficacy.\r\nNothing, I repeat nothing, has happened on the\r\ninternational border or on the Line of Control in Jammu\r\nand Kashmir of late to suggest a failure of this\r\nmechanism or to give rise to any apprehension about a\r\nthreat to peace.\r\nIf a threat to peace exists, it exists because of\r\nPakistani activities and Pakistan’s belligerence, as clearly\r\nmanifested in the Foreign Minister’s speech, and because\r\nof Pakistan’s adventurism. We have no intention of\r\ncrossing the Line of Control or the international border,\r\ndespite the grave provocations from across the border.\r\nWhat are these provocations? The Pakistan Foreign\r\nMinister said this morning that his country did not\r\nsupport the terrorists militarily. The same Human Rights\r\nWatch which he quoted so selectively to criticize both the\r\nUnited States and India, has this to say in its report:\r\n\"The extreme gravity of the abuses committed\r\nby militant groups in Punjab and Kashmir is in part\r\na direct consequence of the diffusion of advanced\r\nlight weapons and small arms, and the evident\r\nfailure of those assisting the militants to pressure\r\nthem to respect human rights. ... Pakistani support\r\nfor the militants - direct support in the form of arms\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nshipments and training ... - has greatly facilitated\r\nabuses.\"\r\nPakistan will obviously not restrain the terrorists\r\nbecause its Government has a systematic policy of abusing\r\nhuman rights. Through the constitutional and legal\r\nframework of Pakistan, state policy legitimizes intolerance.\r\nA constitutional and legal apartheid exists in Pakistan in\r\nrelation to religious minorities, and even with regard to\r\nminority sects within the majority community. Several\r\nhundred thousand Pakistani citizens have languished from\r\n1972 in refugee camps in another country, because Pakistan\r\ndenies them the right of return to their own country. Nor\r\nhas the Pakistani Foreign Minister told us of another group\r\nof his country’s citizens who refused to enroll as voters in\r\nelections last year because they preferred to be\r\ndisenfranchised rather than accept a state-given label for\r\ntheir faith. Nor would he care to inform us about the\r\ncontents of a fact sheet published by the Pakistan Human\r\nRights Council in Islamabad on 1 July this year about the\r\ngross human rights violations in Pakistan since the present\r\nGovernment came to power in October 1993.\r\nWhat is true of the minorities, and particularly of\r\nwomen, is also true of ethnic groups in different parts of\r\nPakistan. Pakistan is a society at war with itself.\r\nThe territorial ambitions of Pakistan in Kashmir are\r\novert and blatant. Every Pakistani leader since 1947 has\r\ndescribed the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir as an\r\nintegral part, sometimes as the jugular vein, of Pakistan.\r\nThis was true of Mohammad Ali Jinnah in 1947, and it is\r\ntrue of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1994. Pakistan\r\ndeludes the world by talking about self-determination. It\r\nhas incorporated without any legality that part of Jammu\r\nand Kashmir known as the Northern Areas; another part of\r\nthe state illegally occupied by Pakistan is obliged by\r\nPakistani law to proclaim its integration with Pakistan. In\r\nthe Pakistani vocabulary, self-determination is apparently\r\nsynonymous with predetermination as ordained by Pakistan.\r\nWhat Pakistan wants is to grab territory which legally and\r\nconstitutionally belongs to another country.\r\nIt is this expansionist and adventurist aim which has\r\nled Pakistan, as acknowledged by a former chief of the\r\nPakistan Air Force last August, to start three wars against\r\nIndia. Its armies having been beaten, Pakistan is now\r\ntraining and arming terrorists against India. This is amply\r\ndocumented by independent sources and recognized by\r\nmost responsible Governments, and is frankly\r\nacknowledged even by Pakistani officials and political\r\npersonalities. The Prime Minister of Pakistan immediately\r\npreceding Mrs. Bhutto stated very recently that Pakistani\r\nGovernment agencies had endeavoured to finance these\r\nclandestine operations by selling heroin and other narcotic\r\ndrugs; this was reported in graphic detail by The\r\nWashington Post on 12 September.\r\nIndia is a peace-loving, democratic country. Jammu\r\nand Kashmir is and shall remain an integral part of India.\r\nThe people of Jammu and Kashmir are citizens of India,\r\nand they must be allowed to enjoy the same rights and\r\nprivileges as other citizens of the nation without the threat\r\nof the gun. They have repeatedly exercised their\r\nfranchise, and the current political process undertaken in\r\nthe state is aimed at enabling the people of Jammu and\r\nKashmir to participate in the electoral process again very\r\nshortly to choose their own representatives.\r\nA redrawing of the constituencies and a revision of\r\nelectoral rolls are under way. It is now time for those\r\nwho wish to do so to use their influence and good offices\r\nto prevail upon Pakistan to terminate its support of those\r\nwho seek to disrupt democracy by violence and\r\nintimidation.\r\nWe can sum up Pakistan’s record in terms of its own\r\nadmissions. First, Pakistan started all the three wars\r\nagainst India; secondly, Pakistan runs training camps for\r\nmilitants and terrorists on its territory; thirdly, Pakistan\r\nhas used illegal trafficking in narcotics to finance arms\r\npurchases and clandestine terrorist activities directed\r\nagainst other countries; fourthly, Pakistan practices\r\nbigotry as State policy and has systematically\r\ndiscriminated against religious minorities; fifthly, Pakistan\r\nhas crushed the basic rights of its ethnic groups; and,\r\nsixthly, contrary to the protestations of its leaders past\r\nand present, Pakistan has made no effort to counter the\r\nforces of irrationality, extremism and terrorism.\r\nThis is the perspective in which Pakistan’s words\r\nand actions in relation to my country have to be judged.\r\nThis is the backdrop to the grim struggle in which the\r\nGovernment and people of India have been forced to\r\nengage to protect the territorial integrity of their country\r\nand the human rights of their citizens threatened by\r\nPakistani-sponsored terrorists.\r\nThis struggle is not of India’s choosing. It is and\r\nwill always remain our desire to live in peace and good-\r\nneighbourly relations with Pakistan and to seek\r\ncooperation for the benefit of the people of our two\r\ncountries. We in India close no doors. Our offer of talks\r\nwith Pakistan on all subjects at any time, in India or\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nPakistan, at official or ministerial level, has remained\r\nunanswered for many months. We now reiterate this offer\r\nof talks. Let Pakistan answer it instead of seeking alibis.\r\nPakistan believes that the incessant repetition of\r\nfalsehoods will turn them into truth. We know that the\r\nrepresentative of Pakistan will again repeat his oft-repeated\r\narguments in his reply to this statement. I assure the\r\nAssembly that we have no intention of wasting its time any\r\nmore on a subject which is not relevant to it.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Arabic): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Pakistan, who has asked to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply. I ask him to comply\r\nwith the provisions of General Assembly decision 34/401.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): My delegation is constrained\r\nto respond to the string of falsehoods which have been\r\nmouthed by my colleague from India.\r\nHe began his statement with the biggest falsehood,\r\nwhich is that Kashmir is a part of India. This is a legal\r\nfiction. In all its resolutions on this subject the Security\r\nCouncil has decided that the final disposition of Kashmir\r\nshall be determined by its people through a United Nations-\r\nsupervised plebiscite. India has accepted this decision and\r\nis bound to comply with it. The maps of the United\r\nNations all show Kashmir as disputed territory. In\r\nKashmir, the oldest United Nations peace-keeping force is\r\ndeployed at present along the cease-fire line.\r\nAbove all, the people of Kashmir do not consider\r\nthemselves as part of India. On India’s independence day,\r\n15 August, all the houses and huts of the Kashmiris flew\r\nblack flags of protest. The day before, on Pakistan’s\r\nindependence day, those same houses and huts flew the star\r\nand crescent of Pakistan. The people of Kashmir have\r\nspoken eloquently, as far as they can, to express their\r\nwishes about which country they wish to belong to. The\r\nKashmiri people are part of Pakistan. They are being kept\r\napart from us by the bullets and bayonets of India’s\r\n600,000-strong army in Kashmir. This is the largest\r\noccupation force in the world and in colonial history.\r\nIndia says that it is a peace-loving country. This is\r\nvery strange to hear. Let India say this to the people of\r\nNepal, of Bhutan, of Sri Lanka, of Bangladesh, of Sind, or\r\nof its own provinces of Punjab, Assam and Tripura, where\r\nthe Indian army has been involved in interventions time and\r\ntime again. This country, which professes the principles of\r\nthe peaceful Ahimsä of Mahatma Gandhi, has engaged in\r\nthe largest number of conflicts of any State represented in\r\nthis Hall. At any given moment, Indian armed forces are\r\nbeing employed in the use of massive force to repress\r\npeople who have rebelled against the impositions of this\r\ncountry.\r\nIndia has spoken about terrorism. What about Indian\r\nterrorism in Kashmir? What about an 11-year-old girl,\r\nFatima, who was sleeping with her mother when the\r\nIndian forces entered and shot her? This is from a report\r\nof 11 September 1994 - a few days ago - in the Toronto\r\nStar. What about Mashrul Sultan, a chemistry-finals\r\nstudent in Srinagar, who was pulled off a city bus and\r\nshot, but miraculously lived? He said: \"I am not a\r\nmilitant. I just wanted to do my studies.\" These are\r\nexamples of countless and daily events in Kashmir today\r\n- this from the \"peace-loving State\", the \"largest\r\ndemocracy in the world\".\r\nTerrorism is the use of indiscriminate force against\r\ninnocent people. As my Minister has said, by that\r\nyardstick alone India is the biggest terrorist State in the\r\nworld.\r\nThe representative of India has said that there is no\r\nthreat to peace and security in South Asia. This is very\r\nencouraging for us to hear. On 15 August, the Prime\r\nMinister of India threatened Pakistan in a speech. Indian\r\ngenerals have time and time again stated that they would\r\nteach Pakistan a lesson.\r\nIndian statesmen have advocated the use of hot\r\npursuit across the Line of Control to strike at so-called\r\ncamps in Azad Kashmir. There are no camps. This is\r\nIndia’s design to intimidate Pakistan. We will not be\r\nintimidated by this kind of talk.\r\nBut let the representative of India not tell us that\r\nthere is no threat to peace. Almost all of the third largest\r\narmy in the world is deployed against Pakistan. This is\r\na threat to peace. They are violating the cease-fire every\r\nday across the Line of Control. Our civilians are being\r\ntargeted every day.\r\nIf India wishes us to believe otherwise, let it accept\r\nthe United Nations Military Observer Group on its side of\r\nthe Line of Control.\r\nIndia has said that it wishes to have talks in\r\naccordance with the Simla Agreement. Pakistan is also\r\ncommitted to dialogue in order to promote peaceful\r\nrelations with India and to resolve the Kashmir dispute.\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 4 October 1994\r\nBut we have tried for 22 years to promote this dialogue\r\nwith India, and it has resulted in a dead end.\r\nIndia says it has not violated the Simla Agreement.\r\nBut let me ask my colleague from India: What about\r\nSiachin? Did Indian forces not march into Siachin in\r\nviolation of the Simla Agreement? And are not these\r\nforces still in the Siachin glacier, refusing to withdraw, in\r\ncontravention of the Simla Agreement?\r\nIndia says it desires talks. India desires talks when\r\nthe General Assembly meets, when the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights meets, when it is afraid that the\r\ninternational community will censure its violations of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nIndia cannot talk peace with Pakistan and make war\r\non the Kashmiri people. Let India stop making war on\r\nthe Kashmiri people. We shall be ready to sit at the table\r\nwith India on that day.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.45 p.m.\r\n39\r\n"
