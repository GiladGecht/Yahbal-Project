(Cóte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bakili Muluzi, President of the Republic\r\nof Malawi\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Malawi.\r\nMr. Bakili Muluzi, President of the Republic of\r\nMalawi, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Malawi, His Excellency Mr. Bakili Muluzi, and\r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Muluzi (Malawi): I congratulate you, Sir,\r\non your election to the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nat its forty-ninth session. Malawi is proud of you and of\r\nyour country, Côte d’Ivoire, as you represent Africa in that\r\nvery important post. I have every confidence that you will\r\nguide the deliberations of the Assembly to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nI join other delegations in paying tribute to your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of\r\nGuyana. Mr. Insanally fulfilled his mandate very well\r\nindeed, despite the many difficult tasks the United Nations\r\nhad to carry out during the past year. My delegation\r\nwishes Ambassador Insanally well in his future endeavours.\r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nhas once again demonstrated that he is the right man to\r\nlead our Organization as it continues to assume greater\r\nresponsibilities, particularly in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The Secretary-General\r\nhas ably led the Organization in responding most\r\npositively to the many conflict situations that beset the\r\nworld today. My Government lends its support to his\r\nconsiderable efforts aimed at assuring international peace\r\nand security and at promoting economic and social\r\ndevelopment around the world. We wish him all the best\r\nin carrying out his arduous tasks.\r\nAs I address the Assembly today, 30 years after the\r\nonly time my predecessor did so, I bring with me a\r\nmessage of renewed hope and friendship from the people\r\nof a newly democratic Republic of Malawi to all the\r\npeoples of all the States represented here this morning.\r\nFreed from fears of itself, Malawi courageously embraces\r\nthe rest of the family of nations; freed from self-imposed\r\nisolation, Malawi stands ready to engage actively in\r\nefforts to find international solutions to the problems of\r\nour times.\r\nEveryone here today will be fully aware of the\r\npolitical changes that have taken place in my country\r\nduring the past two years. The one-party dictatorship that\r\nhad ruled Malawi for 30 years came to an ignoble end by\r\nthe will of the people. In the historic elections held on 17\r\nMay this year, the people of Malawi threw out an\r\noppressive Government that had for so long trampled\r\nupon their human rights and fundamental freedoms with\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nimpunity, through arbitrary arrests, detentions without trial,\r\nand torture, a Government that brutally suppressed all\r\npolitical dissent and denied its people any form of freedom\r\nof expression and association. In so doing, it sought to rob\r\nits people of the very essence of a human being: the ability\r\nto think. The people of Malawi rejoin the family of nations\r\ntoday as a free people.\r\nLet me assure the Assembly that the Malawian people\r\nshall never allow any form of dictatorship to rear its ugly\r\nhead on their soil again.\r\nThe national referendum held in June 1993 and the\r\npresidential and parliamentary elections held in May this\r\nyear took place in a peaceful manner, and have both been\r\ndeclared by the international community to have been free\r\nand fair. This outcome was a clear manifestation of the\r\nardent desire of the people of Malawi to see change\r\nbrought about in their country: positive change, where\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms are enjoyed and\r\nrespected by all, individually and collectively.\r\nThe changes in Malawi resulted also from the\r\nconcerted efforts and assistance of the international\r\ncommunity. On behalf of the Government and the people\r\nof Malawi, I wish particularly to thank the United Nations\r\nfor its special role in the process of reform and\r\ndemocratization in Malawi. The Electoral Assistance\r\nDivision of the Secretariat here in New York, the Centre\r\nfor Human Rights in Geneva and the office of the United\r\nNations Development Programme in Malawi all worked\r\ntirelessly to help us set up the necessary institutional\r\nframework for bringing about the desired political change.\r\nLet me also thank the Commonwealth Secretariat, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the friendly Governments\r\nand the non-governmental organizations that were involved\r\nin our transition process for the invaluable assistance they\r\ntoo rendered to Malawi during this very critical and delicate\r\nstage of our nation’s evolution. It is my sincere hope that\r\nour partners in the democratic transition will consider ways\r\nin which they can continue to work with the Malawian\r\npeople as they confront the many serious problems arising\r\nfrom the excesses and vagaries of the discredited order they\r\nrecently overturned.\r\nMy Government is committed to consolidating peace,\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law in Malawi. We have\r\nemphasized that our struggle was not about personalities or\r\nindividual leaders, but rather about changing the political\r\nway of life. It has always been the desire of the\r\nGovernment to work constructively, together with other\r\nparties, for the benefit of the nation. It is therefore\r\npleasing that recently the Government and one of the\r\nopposition parties, the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD),\r\nreached an agreement that facilitated the appointment to\r\nthe Cabinet of some AFORD members, including\r\nMr. Chakufwa Chihana, President of AFORD.\r\nMy Government has refrained from any form of\r\nwitch-hunting or revenge against members of the former\r\nregime. No one in Malawi need ever fear for his life or\r\nliberty simply because he holds differing political views\r\nor beliefs. In this context, my Government will guarantee\r\nall persons accused of wrongdoing the opportunity to be\r\nheard in an open court of law.\r\nWe have at the same time expressed our desire to\r\nsee established in Malawi a culture of respect for human\r\nrights. In this regard, my Government has, among other\r\nthings, recently signed with the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Ayala Lasso, who\r\nvisited us in August, a Joint Declaration on the Mutual\r\nDesire to Cooperate in the Development of Programmes\r\nfor the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in\r\nMalawi. Education in Human Rights has thus a\r\nprominent place in the programmes that are envisaged.\r\nThis is because my Government firmly believes that the\r\nrule of law in Malawi can be consolidated if the people\r\nknow and understand what their rights are.\r\nBasic human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\ncannot however be meaningfully enjoyed where people\r\nare living in conditions of economic desperation. The\r\nmajority of the people of Malawi live in extreme poverty.\r\nIt is for this reason, therefore, that poverty alleviation has\r\nbeen given top priority on my Government’s agenda. The\r\nfocus on the alleviation of poverty is intended to help\r\nconsolidate the freedom and democracy that Malawians\r\ncurrently enjoy.\r\nIt is common knowledge that, out of a total in 1994\r\nof 173 countries, Malawi is number 15 from the bottom\r\non the scale of United Nations Development Programme\r\nhuman development indicators. This reflects our\r\nextremely low ratings in socio-economic indicators,\r\ncovering areas such as health, social welfare, education,\r\nhousing, food and nutrition. Malawi’s external debt is\r\nalso quite high. At the end of June 1994, the external\r\ndebt stock stood at $1.9 billion. Malawi’s balance of\r\npayments position is precarious. Its commodity terms of\r\ntrade are deteriorating and are currently estimated at\r\n72.3 per cent.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nMeanwhile, Malawi continues to suffer from the\r\neffects of the severe drought of 1992-1993, which afflicted\r\nthe whole of southern Africa. The country is once again\r\nexperiencing serious food shortages, owing primarily to\r\nvery poor rains in the 1993-1994 season. The country\r\nurgently needs nearly 400,000 metric tons of grain, mainly\r\nmaize, if it is to avert mass starvation and death among the\r\npeople.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has also adversely affected\r\nmy country. The ones hardest hit by this scourge are the\r\nyoung and most productive segment of the population. The\r\nresources which my Government is able to allocate, in its\r\nnational budget, for dealing with this problem are far from\r\nadequate: it wishes it could do more.\r\nMalawi continues to suffer also from the after-effects\r\nof the influx of refugees of recent years. The number of\r\nrefugees from neighboring Mozambique, which once\r\ntotalled over a million people, has now been reduced to\r\nnearly a quarter of a million. But it will take years,\r\nprobably decades, to deal with the full impact of such large\r\nnumbers. Many sectors of the economy, such as health,\r\neducation, the basic infrastructure and the environment,\r\nhave been adversely affected, with grave implications for\r\nthe already serious poverty in the country.\r\nIt is thus quite clear that fulfillment of the\r\nGovernment’s policy for the alleviation of poverty will be\r\na major challenge indeed. The task ahead is enormous.\r\nMany sacrifices will have to be made. My Government is,\r\nhowever, determined to meet the challenges head-on. We\r\nhave to try in order to succeed. In this context, my\r\nGovernment is working out a programme of poverty\r\nalleviation that will be flexible and implementable, and\r\nwhich can benefit from tangible and active assistance from\r\nthe donor community. A Presidential Council on Poverty\r\nAlleviation, under my chairmanship, has been established\r\nto advise the Government on the actual implementation of\r\nthe programmes envisaged. It is the Government’s\r\nintention that people in the rural areas should be the main\r\nbeneficiaries of the poverty alleviation programmes.\r\nThe programmes will also give special attention to the\r\nsituation of children. Malawi is a party to the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child. It is the intention of the new\r\ngovernment to translate the provisions of the Convention\r\ninto reality for every child. The first step was the\r\nintroduction, last month, of free primary education. To\r\ndate, there are 3.2 million children in school — an increase\r\nof 1.3 million from last year. This truly is a children’s\r\neducational revolution.\r\nMy Government is conscious of the need to\r\nempower women so that they can become active in all\r\nsectors of the economy and so that discrimination against\r\nwomen and girls may become a thing of the past. Efforts\r\nare under way to close the gender gap in primary and\r\nhigher education and to ensure the participation of women\r\nin decision-making. We look forward to participating in\r\nthe United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women\r\nin Beijing in 1995.\r\nAllow me at this juncture, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Malawi, to thank, most\r\nsincerely, the United Nations system, donor Governments\r\nand agencies, and our many other partners in development\r\nfor the invaluable assistance that they have given to\r\nMalawi since it attained independence. I have broadly\r\noutlined the problems and challenges that Malawi faces.\r\nI am very confident that our partners in development will\r\ncontinue to assist us as we forge ahead in our efforts to\r\nimprove the standard of living of our people. I wish to\r\nappeal specifically for donor sympathy to write off\r\nexisting loans made to the Malawi Government.\r\nI wish to assure you, Mr. President, that any\r\nassistance that is given to Malawi will be used for the\r\npurpose and target groups intended. The democratically\r\nelected Government should be given the chance to make\r\ndemocracy work. I also invite the private and public\r\nsectors to come and invest in Malawi. The investment\r\nclimate in Malawi is very favourable, and opportunities\r\nexist in such areas as tourism, mining, finance and\r\nbanking, and distribution.\r\nMalawi welcomes the efforts to redefine the role of\r\nthe United Nations in matters pertaining to development.\r\nIn this context, the report (A/48/935) of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, “An Agenda for Development”, is, in our view,\r\nvery timely indeed. The priority areas for development\r\noutlined in the report deserve the political commitment,\r\nactive support and tangible assistance of the international\r\nfinancial and donor community. The key and persistent\r\nproblem areas of concern — external debt and debt\r\nservicing, poor access to science and technology for\r\ndevelopment, inadequate financial flows, rapid population\r\ngrowth, and problems relating to women and to social\r\ndevelopment — need to be tackled head-on. Africa is\r\nparticularly afflicted by these problems and deserves\r\nfocused attention.\r\nThe crisis situation facing Africa calls for urgent and\r\nimportant measures, such as those outlined in the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nthe 1990s, which has yet to be implemented. These\r\nmeasures, as augmented by the conclusion of the Tokyo\r\nConference on African Development, should be given\r\nactive support. Malawi regards the recommended priorities\r\nfor development in the Agenda for Development and the\r\nProgramme of Action outlined in the New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa as being complementary and critical\r\nto the development of Africa. Malawi is all the more\r\ninterested in these developments because they are exactly\r\nin line with the poverty-alleviation strategies that it has set\r\nfor itself.\r\nMany positive political developments have taken place\r\nin Africa in recent times. The current wave of\r\ndemocratization has reached many parts of the continent,\r\nincluding the southern Africa region, and apartheid has\r\nbeen buried. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nthe people of South Africa on their first truly democratic\r\ngeneral elections, held in April this year, which ushered in\r\nthe multiracial Government led by His Excellency Mr.\r\nNelson Mandela. The present Malawi Government is\r\npleased that South Africa has finally and proudly resumed\r\nits seat in the General Assembly and in all the other bodies\r\nof the United Nations, as a free country.\r\nThe people of Malawi have close social, cultural,\r\neconomic and other relations with the people of\r\nMozambique; thus their joy is our joy and their sorrow is\r\nour sorrow. We are one people. We therefore welcome\r\nwholeheartedly the fact that the General Peace Agreement\r\nis so far being implemented satisfactorily. And as\r\nMozambique moves closer to its first multi-party general\r\nelections later this month, it is our firm belief that the\r\nsuccessful installation of a newly elected Government in\r\nthat country will be a major accomplishment for the\r\ninternational community and southern Africa, in general,\r\nand for the Mozambican people, in particular. Such an\r\noutcome will give the people of Mozambique the\r\nopportunity to rebuild their country and truly embark on\r\ndevelopment after many years of vicious civil war. We\r\nwish the people of Mozambique every success as they draw\r\nnearer to the election date.\r\nThe success of the peace process in Angola would be\r\ncause for great jubilation and satisfaction for my\r\nGovernment and the people of Malawi. For too long the\r\npeople of Angola have been denied peace. They deserve to\r\nlive in honour and dignity. They have a right to a peaceful\r\npresent and a hopeful future. Peace in Angola would also\r\nbe of benefit to the entire southern African region.\r\nSouthern Africa requires peace, security and political\r\nstability to enable it to harness and direct its vast human\r\nand natural resources towards economic growth and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe are thus encouraged by the indications of some\r\nprogress in the peace talks that have been going on in\r\nLusaka, Zambia, under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. We fervently look forward to the conclusion of\r\na mutually agreed final resolution to the longstanding\r\npolitical deadlock and armed conflict in Angola.\r\nThe peaceful resolution of conflicts in other parts of\r\nAfrica would give us in Malawi equal joy and comfort.\r\nThus, for example, the situation in Rwanda has been a\r\nsource of great concern to my country. We are, however,\r\ngratified that the horrible carnage we saw in Rwanda\r\nrecently has since come to an end and that the cholera\r\nepidemic and the outbreak of dysentery in the refugee\r\ncamps in eastern Zaire have now been brought under\r\ncontrol. My Government is pleased to have made a\r\nmodest troop contribution to the United Nations\r\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). In this\r\nconnection, let me most sincerely thank the Belgian\r\nGovernment for providing the Malawi troop contingent in\r\nUNAMIR with logistical and other support.\r\nThe task of the international community in Rwanda\r\ngoes beyond humanitarian assistance. The world must, in\r\nthe short term, undertake to assist Rwanda in the process\r\nof political settlement based on national reconciliation. In\r\nthe long term, however, the major challenge for the\r\ninternational community and the people of Rwanda\r\nthemselves is to find ways and means to resolve\r\npermanently the issues that breed and nurture the kind of\r\nintense ethnic fears and suspicion that have resulted\r\nduring the past quarter of a century alone in over four\r\nwaves of blood-letting, which seem to grow more\r\nhorrendous on each successive occasion.\r\nMy Government wishes to record here its support for\r\nthe courageous efforts exerted by the people of Burundi\r\nto avert a similar situation to that which has consumed\r\nneighbouring Rwanda. It has been slow and painfully\r\nfrustrating, but we believe that by having resorted to the\r\nnegotiating table, and not to arms, the people of Burundi\r\nhave taken the first step towards finding a lasting solution\r\nthat will ultimately secure permanent peace for their\r\ncountry. We wish them well in this noble endeavour.\r\nMy Government is greatly concerned at the apparent\r\nlack of a decisive response from the international\r\ncommunity to the pitiful situations in Liberia and\r\nSomalia. We are also saddened by the fact that\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\ninflexibility and dogmatism seem once again to have\r\nbrought to naught months of painstaking effort in the search\r\nfor a solution to the problems of Sudan. Our sincere hope\r\nis that the latest set-back will not lead to abandonment of\r\nthe Sudan situation by the international community.\r\nMy Government has followed closely the situation in\r\nWestern Sahara. While the General Assembly has been\r\nseized of the situation in that Territory, we note with much\r\nconcern that real interest in this issue appears to diminish\r\nevery year. It seems that the Assembly has begun routinely\r\nto adopt resolutions that, in fact, are leading directly to\r\ninternational acquiescence in the status quo. We therefore\r\ncall upon the international community, and in particular the\r\nUnited Nations, to live up to its responsibilities and fulfil\r\nits promise to the Sahouri people by acting without any\r\nfurther delay to hold the long-awaited referendum on that\r\nTerritory’s political future.\r\nMy Government has followed with equally keen\r\ninterest developments in other regions of the world. We\r\nhave been encouraged by the quickened tempo of the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East, as well as by the flame of hope,\r\nalbeit flickering, kindled by the first serious dialogue\r\nbetween the parties to the political deadlock over the\r\nKorean Peninsula. It is my Government’s hope that the\r\ndialogue that has been going on between the People’s\r\nRepublic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nwill lead to a solution that is mutually satisfactory to the\r\nparties concerned.\r\nAt the same time, we have been deeply grieved by the\r\nsituation in the former Yugoslavia, where some, with a\r\nseemingly perverted sense of fair play, would have us\r\nbelieve that if the victimized are prevented from defending\r\nthemselves against the aggressors the conflict there can\r\nmore quickly be brought to an end.\r\nRecently delegations from the United States and Cuba\r\nmet in this historic city and, through negotiations unfettered\r\nby preconditions, were able to reach a mutually agreeable\r\nsolution to a dispute that had heightened tension between\r\nthe two countries. We believe that, through a similar\r\napproach, these two neighbouring countries could also\r\nresolve such differences as have divided them for nearly\r\n40 years. Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and\r\nafter the cold war was declared over, we can see no reason\r\nwhy these two great nations should not sheathe their cold-\r\nwar sabres and embrace each other for the sake of peace\r\nand progress in their region. My Government therefore\r\neagerly looks forward to the day when it can join the world\r\nin applauding the resumption of normal and friendly\r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States.\r\nThe founders of the United Nations set forth\r\nprinciples that have stood the test of time. The validity\r\nof the purposes of the Organization cannot be denied,\r\neven today. Malawi believes in the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations. In our view, this\r\nOrganization, with all its shortcomings, still represents a\r\nviable option for addressing the many political,\r\nsocio-economic and other issues that confront our world\r\ntoday. Working through the United Nations, we can all\r\nmake our world a better place.\r\nThe year 2000 is just six years away. Let us all\r\nwork together to make the twenty-first century one in\r\nwhich respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\nand respect for the rule of law are the rule and not the\r\nexception. Let us work together to emancipate our people\r\nfrom the socio-economic and other ills that hold them in\r\nbondage to misery in their daily lives. Let us work\r\ntogether to avert the escalation of conflict situations. The\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes remains one of the\r\ncardinal principles of this Organization and of\r\ninternational law. Let us make mediation a priority —\r\nmediation at any stage of a conflict. But, better still, let\r\nus use this Organization to find ways to reduce, if not to\r\neliminate, the causes of conflict situations; to reduce, if\r\nnot to eliminate, the means by which conflicts are fuelled\r\nand perpetrated. In making these humble suggestions, we\r\nare inspired by the preamble to the Charter.\r\nOn the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption\r\nof the United Nations Charter, let us resolve to make the\r\nOrganization even more relevant for the next 50 years.\r\nLet us work to strengthen the United Nations. Let us\r\nmake the organs of the Organization more effective,\r\ntransparent and accountable. In this regard, we support\r\nthe current efforts to reform the Security Council,\r\nprovided that such reform is not at the expense of\r\neffectiveness.\r\nLet us all work together to rationalize the work\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations. Let the agenda of our\r\nOrganization reflect the priorities of our time.\r\nThe people of Malawi have embraced democracy\r\nand the rule of law, and they look forward to\r\nconsolidating their recovered freedom. At a time when\r\nglobal interdependence has become a reality, the people\r\nof Malawi look optimistically towards a reform of this\r\nOrganization that will ensure that it can more effectively\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nplay its role in international efforts to achieve security and\r\neconomic prosperity for all the peoples of the world.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Bakili Muluzi, President of the Republic of\r\nMalawi, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Sir Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister\r\nof the Republic of Mauritius\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the Prime Minister\r\nof the Republic of Mauritius.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Mauritius, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius, His Excellency The Right\r\nHonourable Sir Anerood Jugnauth, and inviting him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth (Mauritius): Let me say at\r\nthe outset how pleased I am to see you, Sir, presiding over\r\nthe General Assembly at this session. In addition to being\r\na well-deserved tribute to you personally and to your\r\ncountry, your presidency is a distinct honour and privilege\r\nfor Africa. Your task will definitely not be easy but we are\r\nconfident that your wisdom and broad experience will help\r\nguide our Organization in discharging its leadership role in\r\nworld affairs. I hasten to pledge to you my delegation’s\r\nfull cooperation and active participation in the deliberations\r\nahead.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to say how welcome the\r\nleadership provided by Ambassador Samuel Insanally was\r\nduring the past session. We commend him for the clear\r\nvision and diligence with which he steered the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nequally deserves appreciation for having carried out his\r\nresponsibilities with sagacity and serenity despite the\r\ncomplex and sensitive nature of the issues that have\r\nretained our attention this past year.\r\nIt is also my distinct pleasure to associate myself\r\nwith all those who have extended a hearty welcome to\r\nnon-racial democratic South Africa within the fold of the\r\nAssembly. The end of apartheid in South Africa also\r\nunderscores the end of colonialism on the African\r\ncontinent. However, there still remain a few areas where\r\nthe process is not complete, but I firmly believe that it\r\nwill not be long before we can boast of a totally free\r\nworld. In this regard, I should like to say that, with\r\nrespect to the question of the return of the Chagos\r\nArchipelago to the sovereignty of Mauritius, we have\r\ncontinued to pursue a positive dialogue with the United\r\nKingdom and that some progress has been registered.\r\nThe United Nations of today is perceived differently\r\nfrom what it was less than a decade ago. The fabric of\r\ninternational relations is undergoing profound\r\ntransformation. There is now more latitude and scope for\r\ninternational cooperation and partnership than ever before\r\nand the United Nations is increasingly becoming the focal\r\npoint for such cooperation on a number of fronts. The\r\nnumerous activities in such fields as peace-keeping,\r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking, humanitarian relief,\r\nelection monitoring and supervision undertaken by the\r\nOrganization during the past few years indicate that its\r\nleadership and potential to play an active role on the\r\ninternational scene have been recognized.\r\nBut we should all accept the obvious reality that the\r\nUnited Nations, despite its potential and goodwill, does\r\nnot have the material capacity nor can it muster the\r\nfinancial resources to attend to every potential or actual\r\ncrisis situation. While it has become evident that\r\nsolutions to the present-day crises cannot but be evolved\r\nwithin the framework of international cooperation, such\r\ncooperation, however, is still lacking or, where it does\r\nexist, is but lukewarm in substance. That is why, despite\r\nthe end of super-Power rivalry which, in theory, should\r\nhave eased tensions the world over, conflicts and tensions\r\nhave continued to flare up. Though the international\r\ncommunity does mobilize itself, albeit with disastrous\r\ndelay at times, to address such situations, peaceful\r\nsolutions remain elusive. Is it because our agenda in\r\naddressing these problems is not always the same?\r\nComing from a small island State where our priorities\r\nremain the economic progress of the country and the\r\nconstant improvement of the quality of life of our\r\ncitizens, I harbour the dream that we, leaders of the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\ninternational community, can still bequeath to future\r\ngenerations a world which thrives on peace. On the eve of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Organization can we not\r\npledge and dedicate ourselves to that goal and recommit our\r\nefforts to that end?\r\nIt has, it seems, become fashionable to question\r\nwhether the United Nations system is well adapted to the\r\nnew changing situations that confront us and whether it is\r\nequipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nBut we often forget that we are the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation believes that the United Nations, given\r\nits universality, should inevitably continue to have a central\r\nand important role in the universal management of our\r\nsociety. But to be able to do this satisfactorily there is an\r\nurgent need not only to revitalize the Organization,\r\nstreamlining its agenda, but also to overhaul its structures,\r\nbringing in more transparency in its internal operations and\r\ntaking on board the aspirations of the developing countries\r\nwhich, after all, constitute the majority of our world.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation welcomes the ongoing\r\ndeliberations in the open-ended working group on the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council. It is our hope that the\r\nwide spectrum of views expressed so far on this subject,\r\nthough seemingly divergent, would eventually converge to\r\nbecome a consensual approach that would render the\r\nCouncil more transparent and democratic.\r\nThe review of the membership of the Council should\r\nbe such as to make it functionally effective and as widely\r\nrepresentative of the membership of the United Nations.\r\nBut it should also, I reiterate, be the product of as large a\r\nconsensus as possible to preserve its credibility. In this\r\ncontext, while considering an increase in the permanent\r\nmembership of the Council, one should not be biased in\r\nfavour of the economic giants of this world alone. The\r\ndeveloping countries have a legitimate right to be\r\nrepresented on the permanent slate of the Security Council,\r\nfor our concerns are different from those of the\r\nindustrialized and developed countries. The African and\r\nLatin American continents should imperatively have their\r\nshare of the responsibility incumbent on the Council. We\r\nhave no doubt that those called upon to represent these two\r\ncontinents as permanent members will have significant\r\ncontributions to make in the interest of the world at large.\r\nWhile we do not favour too radical a reform, we believe\r\nthat the decisions of the Council should be arrived at by\r\nconsensus rather than through veto power. Such decisions\r\nwould obviously be more easily acceptable to the\r\ninternational community. However, the present veto\r\nsystem should be maintained for some time to come.\r\nIt is a fact that the United Nations has been playing\r\na more active role in world affairs and has been assuming\r\ngreater responsibilities in the fields of peace-keeping and\r\nmediation in conflicts in a number of countries. But the\r\nrestructuring exercise needs to address other levels of our\r\nOrganization as well, so as to embrace the development\r\ndimension of international relations. In this respect, one\r\nshould not shy away from a possible review of the United\r\nNations Charter itself, but the process, we believe, should\r\nbe gradual and consensual. A strengthened and reformed\r\nUnited Nations should be able to contribute positively to\r\nthe fulfilment of the vision of its founders.\r\nIt is opportune here to remind ourselves of what, as\r\nfar back as 1945, the then United States Secretary of\r\nState reported to President Truman on the result of the\r\nSan Francisco Conference. He said:\r\n“The battle of peace has to be fought on two fronts.\r\nThe first is the security front where victory spells\r\nfreedom from fear. The second is the economic and\r\nsocial front where victory means freedom from\r\nwant. Only victory on both fronts can assure the\r\nworld of an enduring peace. No provisions that can\r\nbe written into the Charter will enable the Security\r\nCouncil to make the world secure from war if men\r\nand women have no security in their homes and\r\njobs.”\r\nAlmost half a century later, we find an echo of the\r\nsame sentiment when our Secretary-General states that\r\n“the development imperative is as much a priority\r\nfor the United Nations as the imperative of peace. ...\r\nThere can be no sustainable development without\r\npeace. There can also be no real peace without\r\ndevelopment.”\r\nWe fully subscribe to those views and would go\r\neven further to say that international peace and security,\r\nas well as an equitable and conducive environment and\r\nthe redress of the asymmetrical international financial and\r\ntrading relations, are necessary prerequisites for the\r\nsustainable development of all countries in the world,\r\nespecially the developing ones.\r\nIn this respect, the plight of Africa is well known to\r\nthe world community. The causes of its ills and of its\r\nweaknesses are well documented. While the disease has\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nbeen diagnosed, the cure is not yet in sight. Africa needs\r\na new order with a clear vision of hope that will ensure its\r\ngradual integration into the international economic and\r\ntrading systems. Its marginalization, deliberate or\r\naccidental, must be stopped and reversed.\r\nThe issue of human rights continues to be the subject\r\nof varying perception. We believe that human rights are\r\nindivisible, and therefore we hold the view that a revised\r\nand reformed United Nations should concentrate equally, if\r\nnot more, on economic, social and cultural rights by\r\npromoting international cooperation for development.\r\nMay I be allowed here to quote the example of\r\nMauritius? Since the last decade, the rapid strides we have\r\nbeen making in the economic field have been accompanied\r\nby consistent progress in the social and cultural fields, as\r\nwell as in the strengthening of the democratic framework.\r\nBasic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of speech, of\r\nassociation and of movement, and the holding of general\r\nelections at regular intervals of five years with the free\r\nparticipation of political parties and individuals are an\r\nintegral part of our culture. Our experience exemplifies the\r\nsynthesis that is being achieved through economic\r\ndevelopment, which brings dignity to the population; social\r\ndevelopment, for the protection of the weaker sections of\r\nthe population; and the strengthening of all democratic\r\ninstitutions, for the evolution of a harmonious society.\r\nThe report by the Secretary-General entitled “An\r\nAgenda for Development” is therefore timely and will no\r\ndoubt place the issue of development in its different aspects\r\nin a prominent place on the international agenda. The\r\nSecretary-General needs to be commended for this\r\ninteresting report, which highlights the multidimensional\r\nnature of development. The report has been further\r\nenriched by the constructive proposals contained in the\r\nMinisterial Declaration of the Group of 77 adopted on 24\r\nJune 1994 in New York. I commend this Declaration as an\r\nimportant contribution by the developing world to the\r\ndebate on the report.\r\nLet our world, both developing and developed, take\r\nadvantage of the new environment. And let us commit\r\nourselves to reducing poverty, hunger and illiteracy in the\r\nworld; commit ourselves to ensuring a steady and\r\nincreasing flow of financial resources, as well as transfer of\r\ntechnology, to the developing countries; and commit\r\nourselves to comprehensively tackling the debt problem.\r\nOnly through such commitments and shared responsibilities\r\nand action in an increasingly interdependent world will it be\r\npossible to stop the further marginalization of a large\r\nnumber of developing countries and help integrate them\r\nin a just and equitable international economic, financial\r\nand trading system.\r\nNext year will witness the establishment and setting\r\nup of the World Trade Organization, which is expected to\r\ncontribute towards the development of an integrated, more\r\nviable and durable multilateral trading system. I take this\r\nopportunity to exhort the members of that organization to\r\nadopt positive measures so as to ensure that the\r\ndeveloping countries, this time, secure a fair share in the\r\nexpected growth of the world.\r\nGenuine fears have been voiced by a number of\r\ndeveloping countries, especially small island States, that\r\nare vulnerable to natural disasters and suffer from the\r\ndisadvantages of being far from their sources of supply of\r\nraw materials and foodstuffs and the markets for their\r\nexport products. It is feared that the results of the\r\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\r\nTrade (GATT) will adversely affect their trade, especially\r\nthe trade preferences from which they benefit in the\r\ncontext of contractual agreements entered into with a\r\ngroup of developed countries, principally with the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nMy own country stands to be affected both as an\r\nexporter and as a net food-importing country. We\r\ntherefore appeal for steps to be taken, as provided for in\r\nthe Final Act of the GATT Uruguay Round, to provide\r\nadequate compensation for any such loss. I should like\r\nhere to stress the need for the preservation of the existing\r\npreferential trade regime of the Lomé Convention of the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific Group and the European\r\nEconomic Community.\r\nAny attempt to bring in new issues concerning the\r\nmultilateral trading system, including the World Trade\r\nOrganization, would not be appropriate at this juncture.\r\nIn this regard, it would serve no useful purpose for the\r\ndeveloped and the developing countries to adopt\r\nconfrontational positions while dealing with such sensitive\r\nissues as the “social clause and the trade regime” and\r\n“trade and the environment”. My country for one will\r\nresist the inclusion of any clause that may appear as a\r\ndisguised protectionist measure.\r\nHowever, I also believe taking as an example my\r\nown country, where worker’s rights are protected by the\r\nConstitution, that internationally recognized labour\r\nstandards and norms and the legitimate rights of workers\r\nshould be respected. This is important if man is to be at\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nthe centre of development. The enjoyment of these rights,\r\nand the observance of labour standards, should be\r\nencouraged in all countries, without, of course, losing sight\r\nof their respective levels of socio-economic development,\r\nor the development needs and objectives of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nI am happy to state, in that context, that my\r\nGovernment recently introduced legislation to ensure that\r\nworkers participate in the management of enterprises and\r\nbecome shareholders in the sugar sector where they are\r\nemployed. This is being done in the context of a new\r\nsocial order based on partnership, and it is meant to favour\r\nthe democratization of the economy.\r\nThis leads me to the forthcoming World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen and the United Nations Conference on Human\r\nSettlements (Habitat II), to be held next year. In our view,\r\nall these conferences are geared towards one simple goal:\r\nto better the lot of mankind, and in so doing, to enhance\r\nhuman dignity. It is our sincere and cherished hope that\r\nthese summit meetings and conferences will contribute to\r\nthe debate on the Agenda for Development and will\r\nencourage a better understanding of the nature and\r\ncomplexity of the development problems facing the\r\ndeveloping world. May these conferences come up with\r\nreasonable and concrete proposals, backed by a clear\r\ncommitment of resources for their implementation.\r\nIt is true that the end of the cold war and the\r\ndisappearance of ideological conflicts have significantly\r\naltered the geopolitical configuration of the world. They\r\nhave modified the nature of international relations, with\r\nstrategic economic alliances replacing military ones in a\r\nworld still in search of a new order — which thus far has\r\nremained elusive.\r\nIn such an uncertain and volatile situation, where the\r\nsurvival of the fittest and of the most competitive is the\r\norder of the day, small and economically vulnerable\r\ncountries need assurances with regard to their security and\r\ncontinued economic development and social progress. In\r\nthis respect, renewed attention is being given, in different\r\nparts of the world, to regional cooperation and integration.\r\nWe believe that the salvation of small and weak\r\neconomies depends on the successful implementation of\r\nregional cooperation and integration programmes. We view\r\nregionalism as an important complement to multilateralism,\r\nespecially when open regionalism does not lead to\r\nexclusiveness. I therefore appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to fully support the successful implementation\r\nof regional cooperation and integration programmes,\r\nespecially the nascent ones in Africa.\r\nIn our own region, organizations such as the Indian\r\nOcean Commission, the Preferential Trade Area for\r\nEastern and Southern African States and the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community are useful vehicles for\r\neconomic cooperation and integration among member\r\ncountries and help to strengthen our economies.\r\nPolitical stability, good governance, respect for basic\r\nhuman rights and freedoms are prerequisites to economic\r\ndevelopment. It is therefore the duty of the international\r\ncommunity to ensure movement in that direction. We\r\nhave, however, failed by not responding quickly enough\r\nto the agony of Rwanda, and, as the Secretary-General\r\nhas stated, we have acquiesced in the continued loss of\r\nlives. The serious plight of hundreds of thousands of\r\nrefugees from Rwanda remains a major source of\r\nconcern. We should redouble efforts and commit\r\nourselves to urgently addressing such human catastrophes\r\nof epic proportions, which, if left unattended or if tackled\r\ntimidly, may very well spill over into neighbouring\r\ncountries of the region and affect them adversely.\r\nI had the opportunity to state my country’s position\r\non this issue at the recent Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) Summit in Tunis, where I warned that Burundi\r\nwas sitting on a powder keg that risked explosion unless\r\nthe international community acted in earnest to contain\r\nthe problem. Though the situation has eased to a certain\r\nextent, due mainly to Operation Turquoise and to the\r\ncommitment of troops from OAU member States, the\r\nregion still remains fragile. Countries which have the\r\nresources must come to the fore and fully assume their\r\nresponsibility to prevent a recurrence of this tragic\r\nepisode.\r\nMy country, for its part, besides its interventions in\r\ninternational forums and its modest contributions in cash\r\nand in kind, played host to the dialogue between the\r\nPresident of Zaire and the President of Rwanda, which\r\nculminated in the signature of an accord with respect,\r\nmainly, to the refugee situation.\r\nI should like to use the opportunity of speaking\r\nbefore this forum to appeal to my brothers in Angola,\r\nLiberia and Somalia and elsewhere in Africa, where\r\npockets of tension exist that can flare up into unnecessary\r\nconflicts, to apply peaceful means to resolve and iron out\r\ntheir differences.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nIt would be fitting here to flag Mozambique as an\r\nexample where dialogue has prevailed over armed struggle,\r\nand where, in a few days’ time, the people will be\r\nexercising their freedom of choice to elect those they wish\r\nto govern the country. Similarly, it is a matter of\r\nsatisfaction that the constitutional problem in Lesotho has\r\nbeen resolved peacefully and through constant dialogue. In\r\nthat respect, I should like to commend the efforts deployed\r\nby my brothers, Presidents Mugabe, Masire and Mandela.\r\nI wish the same fervour could be demonstrated by\r\nothers who are active in the Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nconflict, where countless lives continue to be lost, where\r\nhuman suffering has crossed the limits of endurance, where\r\nthe population seems to have resigned itself to a fate\r\nimposed upon it by the warring factions. Are we not\r\nresponsible enough, human enough, to resolve the problems\r\nbesetting that region, the more so as conflicts like those\r\nwhich have plagued Northern Ireland and the Middle East\r\nover decades, and which appeared unsolvable, are being\r\naddressed resolutely, and with positive results?\r\nIndeed, the positive developments in the Middle East\r\nmark a turning point in the inter-State relationships in that\r\nregion and augur well for peace and stability. It is my\r\nfervent wish that the spirit of moderation and compromise\r\nthat has made it possible for positive results to be achieved\r\nin the ongoing negotiations will continue to prevail and\r\nhelps open other avenues for peace to be restored in the\r\nentire region.\r\nLet us, leaders of the world, on the eve of the fiftieth\r\nyear of our Organization’s existence, take inspiration from\r\nthe positive trends that have emerged in the Middle East,\r\nfrom the successful transition in South Africa as a result of\r\npeaceful negotiations, and commit ourselves to resolving\r\nconflictual situations — historical as well as current —\r\nthrough dialogue. In this regard, let me make an earnest\r\nappeal to Pakistan and to India, countries equally dear and\r\nnear to us, not to internationalize their differences but to\r\naddress them bilaterally through peaceful means. We\r\nshould like to encourage both Governments to resume their\r\ndialogue in a spirit of trust and compromise, in the higher\r\ninterests of their countries and peoples, and indeed in the\r\ninterest of the entire region.\r\nI am gratified to learn that in Sri Lanka, following the\r\ninstallation of the new Government, a dialogue has been\r\ninitiated between the parties in conflict. This is indeed a\r\ncommendable move.\r\nSuch positive efforts can only be beneficial to the\r\ninternational community, for the peace dividends that will\r\nthus ensue will permit the world to tackle, with undivided\r\nattention, the agenda of economic and social development,\r\nin order to make the world a safer place in which to live.\r\nThat is why we continue to hope for speedy positive\r\ndevelopments in such places as Fiji, where equality of\r\ncitizenship is yet to prevail.\r\nAnother issue that remains a major preoccupation of\r\nmy country is the question of disarmament. Next year,\r\nthe Conference to review the Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\n(NPT) will take place. Mauritius has made its position\r\namply clear on this issue. Any extension of the NPT\r\nshould be linked to progress on nuclear disarmament and\r\nthe achievement of a comprehensive test-ban treaty, as\r\nwell as the establishment of a negotiating framework\r\nwithin which the discriminatory nature of the Treaty\r\nshould be examined. We have stated in no uncertain\r\nterms that the world cannot be divided permanently into\r\ncountries permitted to have nuclear weapons and countries\r\nnot permitted to have them. A treaty perceived as\r\nmaking such a decision permanent is bound to fail and\r\ncannot be expected to last.\r\nWithout the convincing support of the NPT\r\nmembers, we may fail in our endeavours to make the\r\nworld nuclear-weapon-free. The recent dispute between\r\na Member State of the Treaty and the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency clearly indicates that the NPT is\r\nnot infallible. Equally alarming is the trading in enriched\r\nuranium and plutonium, in stark contradiction of the\r\nobjectives of the Treaty. As long as there are nuclear-\r\nweapon States, there will be an urge for other States with\r\nnuclear potential to acquire such weapon-grade material,\r\nthus putting the world community in jeopardy.\r\nMauritius would like at this point to welcome the\r\nefforts for the conclusion of a treaty to make all of\r\nAfrica, a nuclear-weapon-free zone. It is our earnest\r\nhope that the exclusive club of nuclear-haves, principally\r\nthe permanent members of the Security Council, will do\r\neverything to permit the emergence of such a zone and\r\nthe conclusion of the treaty.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAs Acting President of the Conference of Heads of\r\nState or Government of French-speaking countries, I should\r\nlike to say a few words in the French language, which\r\nbrings together this community of dialogue and cooperation\r\nnumbering 47 countries with more than 400 million\r\ninhabitants. Since 1986, the highest officials of these\r\ncountries, which are found on the five continents, have been\r\nregularly holding summit meetings to review those\r\nproblems that affect the francophone world and seek\r\ntogether for solutions to global problems.\r\nMy country thus had the honour of hosting the Fifth\r\nSummit of the Francophone World last October. It may\r\nseem surprising to some that a country member of the\r\nCommonwealth whose official language is English should\r\nhave been selected to host such a Summit and thus to\r\nbecome the spokesman of the francophone group for a two-\r\nyear period. In fact, for us Mauritians, this is in no way\r\nunusual, since we live with our cultural and linguistic\r\ndiversity in perfect harmony. Indeed, Mauritian culture is\r\nthe result of a synthesis worked out through history. We\r\nlive in a society that integrates the linguistic, religious and\r\nsocial contributions of Europe, Africa and Asia. The theme\r\nof “Unity in Diversity”, which inspired the work of that\r\nSummit, is very dear to our country. All the segments of\r\nthe Mauritian nation participate in creating a national\r\nidentity while preserving their ancestral cultures. This\r\nmessage of unity in diversity, based on the recognition of\r\ndifference and on human solidarity, is even more relevant\r\nin the difficult and complex situation in today’s world.\r\nThe Heads of State or Government wish the\r\nfrancophone world to cooperate more closely with regional\r\nand international organizations that are working for\r\ndemocracy, peace and the development of the world — first\r\nand foremost, of course, is the United Nations. We have\r\nadopted a series of resolutions to promote this new\r\npartnership. It is, moreover, in this context that we had the\r\npleasure of welcoming the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to\r\nMauritius. During the Summit, we were able to intensify\r\na dialogue that we have been maintaining since then by\r\nvarious means. However, we hardly had time to acquire\r\nthe means to implement our own resolutions when events\r\nbegan to move rapidly in the francophone world.\r\nIndeed, on the day following the Mauritius Summit,\r\nour brother Melchoir Ndadaye, President of Burundi, was\r\nbrutally assassinated. The Organization of African Unity\r\nand the United Nations were immediately notified. Then\r\nthe situation deteriorated in Rwanda, and once again we\r\nnotified these two international forums. Given the lack of\r\naction during the first few days, we welcomed France’s\r\nintervention for strictly humanitarian purposes, which\r\nallowed numerous lives to be saved.\r\nIn addition to their concern regarding the Great\r\nLakes region, the countries of the francophone world are\r\ndeeply moved about the situation in Haiti. We have been\r\nfollowing developments in that country very closely, and\r\nwe were gratified to note that positive steps have been\r\ntaken towards re-establishing democracy. We are\r\nawaiting with great impatience, and in the interest of the\r\nHaitian people, the return of legitimate power to this\r\ncountry, a country that has suffered so much in the course\r\nof its recent history.\r\nThe francophone world, for its part, has adopted\r\nnumerous resolutions aimed at securing for the\r\nFrancophone community a more dynamic presence\r\ninternationally. It will thus be able to make a\r\ncontribution in the specific fields of its competence. I\r\nshould like, in particular, to cite a resolution endorsing\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report, which is rightly entitled\r\n“An Agenda for Development”. This resolution spells out\r\nthose themes which the francophone world would like to\r\nsee taken into consideration in the agenda and which will\r\nbe put forward by our representatives within the United\r\nNations during the preparatory stages.\r\nAt the Rio de Janeiro Summit, later in Vienna, then\r\nin Barbados and in Cairo, and tomorrow in Copenhagen\r\nand in Beijing, the countries of the francophone world are\r\nconsulting on the major problems the United Nations has\r\ninscribed on its agenda. This is being done to arrive at\r\ncommon positions for meeting the great challenges of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSuch concerted action is essential for the harmonious\r\ndevelopment of our world at the dawn of the third\r\nmillennium; hence we are called upon to make a specific\r\ncontribution to illustrate that spirit of humanism that\r\nmotivates the francophone world.\r\nThe Mauritius Summit succeeded in situating the\r\nfrancophone world in a more political and more\r\ndiplomatic context. The francophone world has an\r\noriginal and positive message to spread through the world,\r\na message of liberty, solidarity and sharing. I am most\r\npleased to have conveyed it to you.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf on the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Mauritius for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Mauritius, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAnnouncement\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): Before\r\ncalling on the next speaker in the general debate at this\r\nmeeting, I should like to inform the members of the\r\nAssembly that through an inadvertent error, the wording of\r\nitem 33 is not correctly reflected in document A/49/251,\r\nagenda of the forty-ninth session, and A/49/252, allocation\r\nof agenda items for the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 48/26, the title of item 33 should read: “Question\r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related matters”.\r\nThis change will be reflected in the documents to be issued\r\nsubsequently.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance\r\nof Malaysia, His Excellency Mr. Anwar Ibrahim.\r\nMr. Ibrahim (Malaysia): I should like to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the United\r\nNations General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. May\r\nI also express our appreciation to Ambassador Samuel\r\nInsanally of Guyana for having successfully guided the\r\nwork of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session\r\nand further enhanced its centrality.\r\nThe cold war has ended, and totalitarianism has met\r\nits nemesis. At this very critical stage in history, we must\r\nseize the opportunity to redesign the international order so\r\nas to realize the aspirations of the global community. We\r\nmust meet this challenge and collectively reconstruct a truly\r\njust order for our time and for the generations to come.\r\nIndeed, the global community has reached many\r\nsignificant milestones. More nations have agreed to resolve\r\ntheir disputes by peaceful means. South Africa has\r\nemerged from its political catharsis as a nation free of\r\napartheid and with majority rule; Cambodia experienced\r\nfree and democratic elections; and lasting peace in West\r\nAsia came closer to realization with the Israeli-Palestinian\r\naccords.\r\nHowever, the initial euphoria will be somewhat\r\nshort-lived. The path ahead is strewn with uncertainties\r\nand pitfalls. The end of the cold war has yet to reward\r\nus fully with its promise of global peace and security. It\r\nhas instead unleashed the demons of parochial\r\nnationalism, tribalism, religious fanaticism — as\r\nwitnessed in the “ethnic cleansing” in Bosnia — tribal\r\nwarfare in Rwanda and religious dissension in some\r\ncountries. The North-South divide in wealth, power and\r\ncontrol over resources is still too pronounced to be\r\nignored, and the redistribution of global prosperity is far\r\nfrom being realized.\r\nThe paramount challenge facing the global\r\ncommunity today is to fulfil the promises made in recent\r\nyears of systemic change in the global environment. This\r\nis to be achieved through sustained efforts in regard to\r\neconomic development and through the strengthening of\r\ncivil society and multilateral institutions.\r\nDevelopment is the only secure foundation for global\r\npeace and security, for the origins of conflicts are often\r\nvery deeply rooted in socio-economic deprivation and\r\ndisparities. As for civil society, its growth into maturity\r\nrequires the establishment of institutions for a stable and\r\nresponsive social order, a democratic participatory\r\narrangement as a means to channel political energy, and\r\nan environment in which culture can flourish.\r\nIn all these areas, it is the people that matter — their\r\nfreedom, security and development. All great traditions\r\nof mankind, East and West, concur in the sanctity of the\r\nhuman person, the family as a fundamental unit of\r\nsociety, and the primacy of moral and ethical values as a\r\nfoundation of civilizations. The sanctity of the human\r\nperson warrants the State’s protection of the inalienable\r\nrights of all to freedom, to participate in social, political\r\nand cultural processes and to optimize the potential of the\r\nhuman person through development. The rights of the\r\nindividual must be safeguarded inasmuch as the stability\r\nof society cannot be compromised. It is within this\r\nframework that we conceive the restoration of human\r\nrights in any society, industrial or developing, as a\r\ncontinuing endeavour which we must never abandon.\r\nThe promise made at the 1992 Rio Summit remains\r\nunfulfilled. If no increased official development\r\nassistance is forthcoming and the international target of\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\n0.7 per cent is not met, this will represent a serious\r\nreneging on the Rio commitments, notwithstanding the\r\nGlobal Environment Facility.\r\nThis will raise questions as to the commitment of the\r\nNorth to pledges made at major conferences. The World\r\nSummit for Social Development will take place next year,\r\nand what will be the value of assiduously negotiated\r\ndocuments when, as with the Rio Agenda 21, no real means\r\nare provided for their implementation? The recent\r\nInternational Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting at\r\nMadrid highlighted the preoccupation of the major\r\ndeveloped countries, often at a tangent from the needs and\r\nrequirements of developing countries.\r\nAt the Rio Summit, the developed countries declared\r\nthat the tropical forests belonged to the whole world. It\r\nwas maintained that these forests must always remain in\r\norder to maintain biological diversity and sustain ecological\r\nbalance. Today, South-East Asia is covered in thick haze,\r\nadversely affecting the health of the people. Hundreds of\r\nthousands of hectares of virgin forest are burning, and\r\nvaluable species are being lost.\r\nIf indeed the tropical forest is the heritage of mankind,\r\nthe responsibility for its protection must necessarily be\r\ncollective. While the South-East Asian countries will take\r\nthe necessary measures, we appeal to the global\r\ncommunity, especially the richer members, to help us put\r\nout this fire on an urgent and priority basis.\r\nWe regard the issue of global population as\r\ninseparable from the overall concern of development.\r\nReductions in fertility mainly come about from investment\r\nin education and health care for women. While we share\r\nthe fundamental objectives of the Conference on Population\r\nand Development in Cairo, we deplore the attempt to\r\nimpose views without regard for the values of others.\r\nThe peace dividend that we aspire to reap will not be\r\nrealized without sustained growth in the global economy.\r\nHowever, growth prospects are often hampered by short-\r\nsighted policies and structural crises within the industrial\r\neconomies. Viewed in this light, the popular call for\r\nmacroeconomic stabilization should not be confined to the\r\ndeveloping countries alone but instead should encompass\r\nboth the developing and the industrial economies.\r\nThe United Nations will soon commemorate its fiftieth\r\nyear of existence. It would be uncharitable to ignore\r\naltogether the outstanding contributions made to humanity\r\nby this world body and its agencies. It has provided a\r\nplatform for international cooperation in the fields of\r\neducation, law, health, culture, economics, refugee relief\r\nand so on. But more significantly, it has, by its very\r\nexistence, prepared the groundwork for a global order that\r\nwould be truly democratic and multicultural.\r\nHowever, as we draw up the balance sheet of that\r\nera and contemplate the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, we must take into serious account our many\r\nlimitations. Clearly, the United Nations as it exists today\r\nis unable effectively to deal with critical global issues. In\r\nthe case of Bosnia and Herzegovina the Security Council\r\nremains paralysed in the implementation of its own\r\nresolutions. Should we also ask then: if the Council was\r\nready to plunge into the Gulf crisis a few years ago, how\r\ncan that be reconciled with the political timidity and clear\r\nabsence of resolve to take effective action in the case of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, even after the rejection of the\r\nso-called peace plan by the Serbs?\r\nWithin the United Nations itself, the peace-keeping\r\noperations decided on by the Security Council provide no\r\nclear institutional structure for consultation, especially\r\nbetween non-Security-Council member troop-contributing\r\ncountries and Security Council members. Yet the major\r\nPowers are resisting the urgent need for regular\r\nconsultations between the Security Council and troop-\r\ncontributing countries.\r\nWhile the situation in Somalia clearly reflected the\r\nneed for some form of United Nations involvement, if not\r\nintervention, there have been other operations where even\r\ncountries in the region have been totally opposed to\r\nUnited Nations involvement. My delegation, which has\r\nbeen deeply involved in United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations, is concerned about operations which serve\r\nquestionable interest groups.\r\nIn the Security Council, while agreement between\r\nthe Permanent Five has removed obstacles and facilitated\r\nsettlements of disputes, the momentum behind the push to\r\nsolve issues, if not properly checked and balanced by a\r\nprocess of accountability and non-selectivity of issues,\r\nmay prove to be the undoing of the Council itself and of\r\nits moral authority. The role of major Powers, at least\r\nthose that still deserve that status, is explicitly recognized\r\nin the Charter of the United Nations. However, many of\r\nus will not be willing to agree that these Powers should\r\ncontinue to be Charter-privileged to intervene wherever\r\nthey wish and only when their own interpretations of\r\npeace and security warrant intervention.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nReform of the Security Council is necessary to reflect\r\na more equitable geographical representation and towards\r\nmaking the Council more accountable to the general\r\nmembership. Resistance from a few, whose own claims to\r\nbeing major Powers are becoming increasingly\r\nunpersuasive, should not be allowed to stand in the way of\r\nchange. The issue is not one merely of enlarging the\r\npermanent membership but is one of enhanced participation.\r\nAs the Council is unrepresentative, the first step towards\r\nreform must be to increase the numbers of non-permanent\r\nmembers. The veto, a creation of the power politics of the\r\npast, must be part of the total reform of the Council.\r\nThe United Nations still represents the best recourse\r\nfor developing countries to advance their interests in global\r\naffairs. Hence, we cannot allow the present uncertainties\r\nabout the structure and role of the United Nations to remain\r\nunresolved. The United Nations, despite financial\r\nproblems, cannot be allowed to become a mendicant of the\r\npower brokers at the expense of the principles of the\r\nCharter.\r\nThe United Nations is the only institution capable of\r\nproviding the vehicle for a comprehensive and integrated\r\napproach to peace and development. A revitalized\r\nEconomic and Social Council has the potential to\r\ncoordinate and, it is hoped, harmonize policies emanating\r\nfrom separate bodies such as the G-7 and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions. In this regard priority must be\r\naccorded to an Agenda for Development which would\r\nprovide the new framework for international development\r\ncooperation, the basis for a truly global partnership.\r\nThe United Nations must also spearhead the struggle\r\ntowards total and complete nuclear disarmament. The\r\nmajor Powers must not slacken the momentum towards\r\neffective non-proliferation and comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaties, critical to our collective resolve to halt the arms\r\nrace and eliminate the utilization of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nMalaysia is prepared to make an early commitment to\r\nthe goals of true globalism and, with a genuine mechanism\r\nreposing in the United Nations, to a new world system for\r\ninternational peace, security and development. We will\r\ncontinue to participate actively in the work of the\r\nmultilateral system.\r\nInternational society has grown fourfold since 1945.\r\nThe world is heterogeneous and multicultural. Meaningful\r\ndiscourse cannot be limited by the narrowness of\r\nparameters or an overbearing sense of cultural supremacy.\r\nWe must strive to overcome and transcend\r\nunproductive polarizations. We all need to purge\r\nourselves of the arrogance and myopia embedded in the\r\nold mind-set. We must learn to honour diversity of\r\nopinion and the multiplicity of world views and\r\nperspectives on life and society. None the less, they must\r\nnot impede efforts to seek and implement genuine\r\nsolutions for our common good and shared problems.\r\nWe must accept the new realities, particularly the\r\nfar-reaching systemic transformations in the global\r\neconomy. The growing economic strength of East Asia\r\nand the newly industrializing countries will invariably\r\nbring about a new equation of power and responsibility in\r\nglobal affairs.\r\nWe are fully aware of the many shortcomings\r\ninherent within East Asia; its remarkable economic\r\nperformance is far from miraculous. Nevertheless, its\r\nexperience portrays the path of change towards the\r\nqualitative search for excellence. Political stability was\r\nappropriated to garner efforts for economic growth which\r\nultimately became the means to empower the people. Its\r\nstrength, as in the case of Malaysia and other South-East\r\nAsian countries, is to accept and to experience the\r\nproposition that development and democracy are not\r\nmutually exclusive; and the exercise in responsible liberty\r\nby the ordinary people and their participation in public\r\nlife does not necessarily result in social indiscipline and\r\npolitical instability. Development is enriched by\r\nmulticulturalism where the practice of tolerance and\r\nmoderation has turned religious and ethnic diversity from\r\nbeing a source of conflict into an ingredient for success.\r\nIn a world torn by ethnic and religious passions and\r\ncultural prejudices, the experience of South-East Asia in\r\nmulticulturalism may provide some clues for devising the\r\nmeans for peaceful coexistence and productive partnership\r\namong citizens of the global village.\r\nDag Hammarskjöld, when reflecting on the state of\r\nthe world almost 40 years ago, was perhaps less\r\nexuberant than we are at the prospects of globalism.\r\nWith the memory of war still fresh, he said:\r\n“We must serve our apprenticeship and at every\r\nstage try to develop forms of international\r\ncoexistence as far as is possible at the moment.”\r\nThat apprenticeship has now been served. The\r\nUnited Nations must innovate and renew itself to address\r\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. It must\r\nprogress and transform itself from being a theatre for the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nconcert of a few powerful nations into an effective and\r\nrepresentative vehicle for global governance. And, beyond\r\nthat, it must be animated by the spirit of justice and a bias\r\ntowards compassion. In short, the very legitimacy of this\r\ninternational body hinges upon its realizing the ideal of\r\nbecoming the conscience of the global community.\r\nAddress by Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo, Prime Minister\r\nof the Transitional Government of the Republic of\r\nZaire\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the Prime Minister\r\nof the Transitional Government of the Republic of Zaire.\r\nMr. Kengo Wa Dondo, Prime Minister of the\r\nTransitional Government of the Republic of Zaire, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of the\r\nTransitional Government of the Republic of Zaire,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo, and inviting him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Kengo Wa Dondo (Zaire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): At the dawn of the twenty-first century, our\r\nplanet is seeking a new world balance. Five years have\r\npassed since the struggle for world hegemony came to an\r\nend and the arms race became less frenzied. Unfortunately,\r\nthe problems afflicting mankind remain unchanged: death,\r\ndisease, war, famine, poverty, hotbeds of tension, and the\r\ntragic wandering of entire populations. The East-West\r\nblocs have been replaced by North-South blocs. The\r\nwealthy North is worried because the poor South is a threat\r\nto its serenity and comfort.\r\nFar from making the international climate better, the\r\nend of the cold war has unleashed instability in the southern\r\nhemisphere. Our world is facing a threefold crisis —\r\npolitical and economic crises and a crisis of human\r\nsociety — which is sorely testing international solidarity\r\nand the interdependence of States. The many hotbeds of\r\ntension in Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa arouse\r\nanxiety and concern in our Organization. A number of\r\nideas have been put forward to check these evils on a\r\nglobal scale, with greater or lesser degrees of success, but\r\nwe feel that the best approach lies in the old saying: “An\r\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”.\r\nPreventive diplomacy seems to us to be decisive in\r\nmaintaining and promoting peace, as recent world history\r\nshows. Indeed, it is clear that many current conflicts\r\nmight have been avoided had the international community\r\ninvolved itself in time to prevent them from worsening.\r\nFor obvious reasons, I should like to dwell on the\r\ncrisis in Rwanda.\r\nA review of the roots of this tragedy shows that the\r\nimplementation of preventive diplomacy could have\r\nprevented it or at least mitigated its effects. If we go\r\nback to the earliest manifestations of the ethnic conflict\r\nbetween Hutus and Tutsis, we see many opportunities to\r\nresolve it which the international community passed up.\r\nBut let us look at recent history.\r\nIt is clear that if the parties involved had respected\r\nthe Arusha Agreements, the Rwandese tragedy would not\r\nhave taken on its current dimensions. It is equally clear\r\nthat the international community could have guaranteed\r\nrespect for these Agreements. Moreover, the presence on\r\nRwandese soil of foreign and international troops shortly\r\nbefore and during the massacres could have prevented\r\nthem.\r\nThe Zairian delegation has recalled the past so that\r\nwe can learn the lessons it teaches for present and future\r\nproblems. What are these problems?\r\nMillions of Rwandese left their country and took\r\nrefuge in neighbouring countries. This mass exodus\r\ncaused immeasurable damage and created extremely\r\nserious social and economic imbalances in those\r\ncountries. Zaire, for instance, had to absorb nearly 3\r\nmillion people in less than three months. The little city\r\nof Goma, with a normal population of 200,000, on 14\r\nJune alone took in 10,000 refugees a minute. The\r\nmodern world has never seen such an uprooting of\r\npopulations.\r\nThe effects of such a situation could only be tragic:\r\nthe swamping of infrastructures, the re-emergence of\r\nendemic disease, housing shortages, the devastation of\r\ncrops, environmental destruction, disputes among people\r\nliving in close quarters, insecurity, and countless other\r\nexamples. In addition to all this, the nationality problem\r\nis worsening — and it was already a matter of concern in\r\nthat part of Zaire.\r\nThe current situation in countries bordering Rwanda\r\nmeets all the preconditions for preventive intervention by\r\nthe international community. Of course, it is already\r\nengaged in humanitarian operations on behalf of the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nrefugees. My delegation takes this opportunity to thank all\r\nthe countries and organizations involved in these operations.\r\nFrance in particular deserves a special tribute for having\r\nsaved so many lives in “Operation Turquoise”. But it is\r\nhigh time that the international community moved beyond\r\nthe humanitarian aspect towards a solution of the\r\nfundamental causes of the Rwandese tragedy and its effects\r\non neighbouring countries.\r\nThese causes relate to the displacement and presence\r\nof refugees in countries that are in no way equipped to take\r\nin such human masses. Thus the solution lies in the return\r\nof refugees to their country of origin. Yet we note that\r\nnone of the countries directly concerned by this\r\nphenomenon can cope on its own with the situation without\r\nassistance from the international community.\r\nLet us take the case of my country and of Rwanda.\r\nThe tragedy of Rwanda, which occurred shortly before the\r\ninstallation of our current Government in Zaire, could\r\nbenefit only from stop-gap measures on the part of our\r\nGovernment, given the already disturbing situation of the\r\neconomy in Zaire — and the problems remain unsolved.\r\nFrom this rostrum, Zaire issues a fervent appeal to the\r\ninternational community for support equal to the difficulties\r\nexperienced by our population.\r\nWe know that the return of refugees to their countries\r\nis being thwarted by various factors: their administrative\r\nand political organizations were reconstituted in the camps;\r\nthe militia, who are difficult to identify, and the former\r\ncivilian and military authorities, are intimidating the\r\nrefugees; the commitment by the new masters of Kigali to\r\npersuade their compatriots to embark on a voluntary, secure\r\nreturn seems inadequate, to say the least; in an effort to\r\nrespect the spirit of the relevant Organization of African\r\nUnity convention on refugees, the Government of Zaire,\r\nwith no means, is confronted with enormous difficulties in\r\ntrying to remove the former soldiers from the borders.\r\nAll of these factors should lead the international\r\ncommunity to realize the gravity of the situation —\r\nparticularly as the evolution of the Hutu-Tutsi conflict risks\r\nswinging back and forth: today we are witnessing a mass\r\nreturn to Rwanda of Tutsi refugees who were driven into\r\nexile 30 years ago; if the international community is not\r\ncareful, however, tomorrow we will witness another tragedy\r\nin Rwanda, this time tied in with the return of the Hutu\r\nrefugees.\r\nIt is thus urgent that the world help these two ethnic\r\ngroups to learn how to live together again in harmony.\r\nWe believe that solutions to the tragedy in Rwanda\r\nshould include the four following elements: power\r\nsharing between the parties involved; the establishment of\r\na multi-ethnic army; the establishment of guarantees for\r\nthe safe return of refugees; and assistance by the\r\ninternational community to the countries of asylum and of\r\norigin.\r\nHaving sketched out the very dark and disturbing\r\npicture of the situation that prevails in the Great Lakes\r\nregion, I would now like to turn to the situation in my\r\nown country, Zaire.\r\nSituated in the heart of Africa, Zaire is a country in\r\ndeep crisis. Since the beginning of this decade, Zaire has\r\nbeen experiencing a serious institutional crisis, punctuated\r\nby individual events which have contributed to destroying\r\nall the basic balances of our economy.\r\nOur country just barely averted a crisis which could\r\nhave been comparable to the one in Rwanda. As we\r\nknow, the democratization process initiated in Zaire on 24\r\nApril 1990 was one of the most tumultuous of the entire\r\nAfrican continent. A national conference which lasted\r\nalmost two years was unable to reconcile the political\r\nactors. National unity was harmed by the reappearance\r\nof centrifugal and sectarian movements. Ethnic tensions\r\nerupted here and there throughout the country. In short,\r\nwe might well have experienced the same phenomena of\r\nmassacres and mass displacements of populations we\r\ndeplore in Rwanda.\r\nZaire succeeded in averting this great tragedy owing\r\nin large part to the timely assistance provided by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe do not wish to minimize either the wisdom and\r\nthe work done by the internal forces in Zaire, or the\r\nongoing support from what we call the troika: the group\r\nof countries consisting of Belgium, France and the United\r\nStates of America.\r\nWe should also like to recognize that it was under\r\nthe good offices of the Secretary-General of our\r\nOrganization that meetings were held that brought\r\ntogether all of the political trends in Zaire.\r\nThe results of these meetings were of major political\r\nimportance because they put an end to the duplication of\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nconstitutional texts as well as of institutions of transition\r\ntowards a new democratic republic.\r\nOn 11 July 1994 the transitional parliament established\r\na Government which represents the majority of the people\r\nof Zaire. This Government intends to conduct the nation’s\r\npolitics exclusively through parliamentary control.\r\nIn Zaire as elsewhere, democratization is a lengthy\r\nprocess which requires considerable material and financial\r\nresources. I am thinking not of the resources needed at\r\nparticular moments — for example to organize and hold\r\nfree and transparent elections. I am referring to the\r\nsubstantial resources needed to stabilize the economic and\r\nsocial environment, which will provide the framework for\r\ndemocratization. This stability has long been ignored, but\r\ntoday is increasingly being recognized as the prerequisite\r\nfor progress towards democracy.\r\nIf this is truly the case, then many countries in Africa\r\nand throughout the world have small hope of completing\r\ntheir democratization, or at least of completing it within a\r\nreasonable time-frame. For in these countries, politics are\r\ngrossly distorted by ills such as poverty, malnutrition,\r\nignorance, violence and so forth.\r\nWhen a country relies only on its national efforts to\r\nresolve all of those ills, it very quickly gets locked into a\r\nvicious circle which only exacerbates its problems.\r\nThe second crisis facing mankind is economic in\r\nnature. This crisis dates back to the 1970s and derives\r\nfrom fundamental inadequacies in the economic system\r\nestablished at the end of the Second World War. The\r\ngranting of independence to countries that were colonies at\r\nthe time completely changed the international situation.\r\nThis crisis derives from structural lacunae and from\r\nthe imbalance in interdependent areas such as those of\r\ncommodities, trade, energy, currency and finance.\r\nFor this reason, we would propose that the concept of\r\npreventive diplomacy be transposed into the economic area.\r\nThis would imply action being taken on the part of the\r\ninternational community to deal with the imbalance in a\r\nnational economy before that imbalance leads to a\r\nwidespread social crisis.\r\nSocio-economic conditions have worsened\r\nconsiderably in Zaire since the beginning of\r\ndemocratization. In the last five years, the basic balances\r\nof the Zaire economy have been completely destroyed. As\r\na result, there is a particularly acute economic and\r\nfinancial crisis.\r\nThis economic crisis has been accompanied by a\r\nprofound moral crisis, which has led to plundering and\r\nsystematic destruction of the economic fabric.\r\nIt goes without saying that such an economic\r\nsituation can hardly lead us to the blossoming of\r\ndemocracy, due to its negative impact on the living\r\nconditions of citizens.\r\nIt is equally obvious that Zaire cannot emerge all on\r\nits own from this situation. The current Government has\r\nof course included in its programme specific short-term\r\nmeasures to slow down somewhat the continuing\r\ndeterioration of social conditions. But these measures and\r\nthe Government’s recovery plan as a whole can be\r\neffective only if they are supported by strengthened\r\ncooperation between Zaire and its bilateral and\r\nmultilateral partners.\r\nHowever, as is known, this cooperation has been\r\nsuspended, and most of Zaire’s partners are making the\r\nresumption of such cooperation conditional on tangible\r\nprogress being made towards democracy and progress in\r\neconomic management. Thus, we find ourselves faced\r\nwith a complex conditionality. The assistance my country\r\nneeds to move towards democracy and good management\r\nis made conditional on the prior achievement of\r\ndemocracy and good management.\r\nMy country is not an isolated case. This kind of\r\nconditionality is increasingly a determining factor in\r\ncooperation between developing countries, particularly in\r\nAfrica, and their multilateral and bilateral partners. In\r\nother words, many countries today are confronted by a\r\nvicious circle that obstructs their access to the resources\r\nof the international community.\r\nOur Organization must find some means of breaking\r\nthis circle because the survival of vast numbers of the\r\nworld’s citizens — if not that of the human race as a\r\nwhole — is at stake. It is important to note that the\r\nsearch for these means must lead us off the beaten track\r\nso we can find new and imaginative paths. In our search\r\nwe must create new solutions, such as those that made it\r\npossible to rebuild Europe after the Second World War.\r\nThe third ill afflicting the world today is the crisis of\r\nsociety. Human society is falling prey to the re-\r\nemergence and supremacy of force and violence over the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nrule of law in relations between States, in contempt of all\r\nthe rules of good conduct. Two thirds of the human race\r\nsuffers from hunger, endemic disease, malnutrition,\r\nundernourishment, unemployment, lack of information,\r\nacculturation — in short, total underdevelopment. The\r\npolitical and economic crisis also has a negative effect on\r\nsociety.\r\nThe Government of which I am the head is a\r\nGovernment of transition between an old order and a new,\r\nemerging republic in which we will recognize every\r\ncitizen’s right to freedom of thought, expression,\r\nassociation and movement, a new republic where justice is\r\nindependent, where the police and the army must serve to\r\nprotect the citizen, a new republic where the press is free.\r\nMy Government intends to make respect for human\r\nrights in Zaire one of its fundamental priorities of action.\r\nFrom this rostrum I make an appeal to the specialized\r\nagencies of our Organization to share their enriching\r\nexperience with us and to help us effectively in realizing\r\nour aims.\r\nThe establishment of institutions for our new,\r\nresolutely democratic republic will involve the organization\r\nin the near future of free, transparent and honest elections.\r\nMy Government hopes to see the United Nations\r\ncommunity join Zaire in this last stage of our long journey\r\ntowards our goal — a State of law — by assisting in the\r\npreparation, organization and monitoring of these elections\r\nat all levels.\r\nBefore concluding, I would just like to express to you,\r\nMr. President, the great satisfaction my delegation feels at\r\nseeing you presiding over the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session. We are all aware that your election is\r\na tribute to your country, Côte d’Ivoire. But it also\r\nrepresents the international community’s recognition of your\r\nqualities as a statesman and knowledgeable diplomat. Your\r\ncompetence and experience are without any doubt a\r\nguarantee of the success in our work. We also wish to\r\ncongratulate all the members of the General Committee.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not say how greatly my\r\ndelegation appreciates the way in which your illustrious\r\npredecessor presided over the forty-eighth session.\r\nWe extend our best wishes and our support to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\ncommitment and his tireless efforts to promote peace and\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute\r\nto the people of South Africa for their political maturity,\r\nwhich, along with the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity, made it possible to do away with apartheid\r\nand to bring democracy to that country. It is with great\r\njoy and genuine pleasure that, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Zaire, I congratulate the\r\nnew, democratic, multiracial Republic of South Africa on\r\nits return to the United Nations.\r\nFinally, I should like to congratulate the political\r\nleaders of the State of Israel and of the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization, as well as all those who served\r\nas mediators, for their contribution to a comprehensive\r\nand definitive settlement to the conflict in the Middle East\r\nand the question of Palestine.\r\nTo sum up, I would simply say that I came here\r\nwith three messages. The first one is that of the\r\ninterdependence of nations in mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation and with no exclusions. My second message\r\nis that, in its action, my Government attaches the highest\r\npriority to the swift establishment of a new Zaire, a State\r\nof law where fundamental freedoms and the rights of\r\ncitizens will be the major concern of those in power. My\r\nthird message is a call for the effective implementation of\r\nthe concept of preventive diplomacy to promote peace\r\nand eradicate poverty in the world.\r\nMr. Kengo Wa Dondo, Prime Minister of the\r\nTraditional Government of the Republic of Zaire,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nnext speaker is the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the\r\nPhilippines, His Excellency Mr. Roberto Romulo.\r\nMr. Romulo (Philippines): Please allow me to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the exalted\r\noffice of President of the General Assembly. Your\r\ndistinguished career and your experience in international\r\naffairs, together with your outstanding personal qualities,\r\nassure us of wise and skilled leadership at the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nAs we approach the fiftieth year of the life of our\r\nOrganization, let us look back to the first principles of its\r\nexistence. Let us see how we can apply those principles\r\nto the dynamic realities of our time and, to the extent that\r\nhuman discernment will allow, to the uncertain\r\ncircumstances of the next half century.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nMr. Biegman (Netherlands), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nEmerging from the unspeakable horror and devastation\r\nof untrammelled global conflict, the international\r\ncommunity brought forth the United Nations as an\r\ninstrument, above all, for preventing conflict and keeping\r\nthe peace. This mission was to be carried out, if possible,\r\nthrough the encouragement of the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes by the contending parties themselves or, if\r\nnecessary, through the interposition of armed force by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAs with any human institution, the United Nations\r\nrecord in this regard has been mixed. We find that the\r\nUnited Nations has been effective in keeping the peace in\r\nthose cases in which both the parties to the disputes and the\r\nmajor Powers involved have turned — or have been\r\ncompelled to turn — to the international community to\r\nseparate the contending forces and allow them a respite\r\nfrom war. This we have seen in such places as Cyprus,\r\nAngola, Mozambique, Liberia and certain parts of the\r\nMiddle East, including Lebanon.\r\nIn recent years, a singular success was achieved in my\r\nown part of the world when in Cambodia, upon the resolve\r\nof the international community and the Cambodian parties\r\nthemselves, the United Nations not only enforced the peace\r\nbut also managed the transition to a regime of peace and\r\nnational reconciliation.\r\nContending with matters of war and peace has\r\nengaged the greater portion of the attention and\r\npreoccupation of the United Nations and of the international\r\ncommunity. However, our founding fathers recognized\r\nfrom the very beginning that it is not enough to head off\r\ncrises and intervene in conflicts, but that the roots of war\r\nand peace lie in the human condition and the human mind.\r\nIt is thus there, at their roots, that mankind must deal with\r\nquestions of war and peace.\r\nAs we look back at this half-century, we see with\r\nextraordinary clarity that the enduring triumphs of the\r\ninternational community have come not with the imposition\r\nof outside force but when the deepest concerns of the\r\nnations and peoples involved are addressed and resolved.\r\nIn the past year, two such triumphs brightened, like twin\r\ncomets, the history of the human community, forcefully\r\ndemonstrating yet again this essential reality. These\r\ntriumphant achievements came in precisely those two areas\r\nthat had most deeply engaged the United Nations for the\r\ngreater part of its existence — South Africa and the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nIn South Africa, national peace and reconciliation in\r\na regime of democracy emerged victorious after decades\r\nof struggle, led by the United Nations, against apartheid\r\nand on behalf of human dignity, racial equality, majority\r\nrule and political pluralism. This happened only after\r\nmost of the political forces in the country recognized\r\nthese universal values as essential to the survival of the\r\nSouth African nation.\r\nIn the Middle East, the dramatic breakthrough\r\nworked out by Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO) has opened the doors of hope for an\r\nend to the Arab-Israeli conflict. This was made possible\r\nby the tenacious insistence of the international\r\ncommunity, mainly through the United Nations, on the\r\nright of the Palestinian people to govern themselves and\r\non the right of all States in the region to a secure\r\nexistence within internationally recognized boundaries. It\r\nfinally occurred because the leaders of Israel and the PLO\r\nand other Arab leaders recognized the essential nature of\r\nthese rights.\r\nSadly, savage conflicts continue to ravage lives in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, Rwanda and other\r\nareas experiencing similar tragedies, mainly because\r\npeople of influence among the various ethnic groups,\r\ntribes and clans have not accepted the fundamental truth\r\nof their common humanity.\r\nFor a long time, the United Nations has advanced\r\nthe proposition that economic development — raising the\r\nincome of a nation as a whole — was vital to peace and\r\nstability in the world. The United Nations is certainly\r\nright to emphasize this important reality. In many cases,\r\nextreme poverty has led to despair and to a sense of\r\noutrage over the perceived injustice of living in penury\r\nand deprivation in a world of affluence and profligate\r\nconsumption, of being inadequately compensated for the\r\nuse by others of one’s nation’s human and natural\r\nresources, and of being doomed to a chronic inability to\r\nshake off an unpayable debt to foreign creditors.\r\nFortunately, many developing nations — and the\r\nPhilippines is proud to take its place among them — have\r\nmade hard political decisions and adopted economic\r\npolicies favourable to dynamic and sustained economic\r\ngrowth.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nThese are thus hopeful times for economic growth, at\r\nleast for those countries in a position to take advantage of\r\na more liberal international trading regime. However, as\r\nmany countries, and the United Nations itself, have\r\nrealized, economic development by itself is not enough.\r\nRaising the overall income of a nation is not enough. A\r\nlarger gross national product does not necessarily mean a\r\nbetter life for the individual citizen. A bigger economy by\r\nitself does not satisfy the individual person’s aspiration to\r\nhuman fulfilment.\r\nIndeed, economic growth cannot be sustained for long\r\nunless the individual citizen and the individual community\r\nhave a stake in that growth and unless they are mobilized\r\nand empowered to take active part in the process of\r\ndevelopment. Economic growth would be meaningless to\r\nthe individual who does not share in its benefits or whose\r\ncommunity is destroyed by it. Development is empty for\r\npersons who are deprived of their individual rights and\r\nfreedoms. A society cannot find fulfilment in growth, and\r\nindeed the development process itself is severely hampered,\r\nif it does not take adequate care of its vulnerable groups:\r\nwomen, children, ethnic minorities, the handicapped, the\r\nhomeless. Development cannot be sustained unless the\r\nnurturing qualities of the natural environment are conserved\r\nfor future generations.\r\nCare for citizens’ fulfilment as human beings, for their\r\ncommunity and for society cannot wait. It cannot wait for\r\ntotal peace to be achieved or for a certain level of\r\ndevelopment to be attained. All these — peace,\r\ndevelopment, and the quality of society and of human\r\nlife — must proceed simultaneously.\r\nWe in the Philippines have learned this lesson the hard\r\nway and are now applying it faithfully. We have secured\r\npeace and national reconciliation through a peace process\r\nthat includes having sincere discussions with dissident\r\nelements and extending a generous amnesty to them. We\r\nhave granted a substantial degree of autonomy and self-rule\r\nto our ethnic minorities, particularly the Muslim\r\ncommunity. We have devolved extensive authority,\r\nresponsibility and resources on local governments and\r\ncommunities, and we have restored the system of\r\ndemocratic pluralism, through which the people and their\r\ngroups can thrash out their grievances and advance their\r\ninterests in peace and with civility.\r\nAt the same time, we have pursued a purposeful\r\nprogramme of economic development through the\r\nliberalization of the conditions governing trade, investments,\r\nand banking and finance, and through the privatization of\r\nGovernment enterprises. We have provided infrastructure\r\nfacilities and generous incentives for domestic and foreign\r\ninvestors. These, together with the restoration of political\r\nstability, have placed us back on the road to economic\r\nrecovery and self-sustaining growth.\r\nSimultaneously, we have adopted a social agenda\r\nthrough a broad national consensus. In accordance with\r\nthat agenda we have endeavoured to improve the quality\r\nof life of our people, not only because such an\r\nimprovement is their inherent right, and not only because\r\nthe ultimate purpose of development, in our view, is the\r\nwelfare of the individual and his community, but also\r\nbecause we know that the best way to spur economic\r\ndevelopment is to afford the people a stake in it and\r\nbecause we recognize that the people are an economy’s\r\nmost vital resource.\r\nWe are thus jealously safeguarding the individual\r\nFilipino’s fundamental rights and freedoms. Part of this\r\neffort is the importance that we place on human-rights\r\neducation for all, including the armed forces and the\r\npolice, a mission that is mandated by a unique provision\r\nin our Constitution.\r\nWe are expanding the empowerment of our people\r\nand their communities, particularly of the most vulnerable\r\ngroups. We have devoted attention and resources to the\r\nconcerns of women, including women workers, and of\r\nchildren, particularly those of the poor. We have\r\nprotected the rights and culture of our ethnic minorities.\r\nAnd we have allocated substantial resources to health and\r\neducation for the development of our people as our most\r\nvaluable asset.\r\nWe in the Philippines believe that this simultaneous\r\nand balanced approach to peace, development and the\r\nquality of individual lives must be applied in the\r\ninternational community as well as within nations, in the\r\nfamily of man as well as in national societies.\r\nThe expansion of the global economy is important\r\nfor peace in the world and the progress of nations, but it\r\nis not enough. Each country must have a stake in this\r\nexpansion and an enlarged share of it.\r\nEven this is not enough. The international\r\ncommunity must go beyond nations in its ministrations.\r\nIt must devote greater attention to care and respect for\r\npeople and to the recognition of the inherent equality of\r\nall human beings — regardless of gender, of age, of race,\r\nof religion, of language, of culture or of nationality.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nWe must all remember that the sources of conflict do\r\nnot lie only in disputes over territory or resources. As we\r\nknow only too well, they arise also, and it seems\r\nincreasingly, from intolerance of other people’s beliefs and\r\ncultures and from the less than human treatment of people\r\nfrom other lands.\r\nMankind has made progress in advancing the truth that\r\nthere are certain things that transcend national boundaries\r\nand are the common heritage, the common concern and the\r\ncommon responsibility of all nations and of mankind as a\r\nwhole. Among these are the environment and the oceans\r\nand their resources.\r\nThere is something else that transcends national\r\nboundaries and summons global responsibility, something\r\nthat is of infinitely greater worth than even the environment\r\nor the oceans. I am speaking of the world’s most\r\nvulnerable human groups. I speak specifically of migrant\r\nworkers, refugees, children, the aged and the disabled, and\r\nthe special concerns of the world’s women.\r\nThe transnational migration of workers is an\r\nincreasingly prominent phenomenon of international life in\r\nour time. This is the result of supply and demand for\r\nworkers seeking equilibrium. Migrant workers, however,\r\nare more than a commodity to be traded in the international\r\nmarket-place. They have the same dignity and rights as\r\nany of us in this Hall. Moreover, they make a vital\r\ncontribution to the economies and societies of the countries\r\nin which they live and work.\r\nAnd yet, many countries, including developing\r\ncountries, treat migrant workers as being less than the\r\nhuman beings that they are. At best, these workers are left\r\nunprotected by the law governing labour and employment.\r\nThe international community, the United Nations, cannot\r\nallow the abuse of these vulnerable and valuable members\r\nof the human family to continue.\r\nWe urge member States to ratify or accede to the\r\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rights of\r\nAll Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families as an\r\nexpression of their recognition of the common humanity\r\nthat they share with migrants and their families.\r\nThe Secretary-General might form a group to submit\r\nrecommendations to the Assembly at our next session on\r\nimproving coordination of the various efforts of the United\r\nNations on behalf of migrant workers. And I call upon the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights to make the rights\r\nof migrant workers one of his priority concerns.\r\nI reiterate the call for a global conference on\r\ninternational migration and development, which was\r\nsupported by many delegations at the recent International\r\nConference on Population and Development, held in\r\nCairo.\r\nNatural and man-made disasters have created\r\nlarge-scale flows of refugees around the world. While the\r\ndistinction between refugees and economic migrants has\r\nto be resolutely made, genuine refugees must be given all\r\nthe protection that international conventions call for.\r\nChildren, by their very nature, have a claim to\r\nmankind’s protection and care. That claim is special in\r\nthe case of street children, children coerced into drug\r\naddiction, refugee children and children in the areas of\r\narmed conflict or natural disasters. National societies and\r\nthe international community must ensure that such\r\nchildren are provided with adequate food, medical care,\r\nshelter and education. We may need to draw up a\r\nconvention dealing with the sale of children, child\r\nprostitution, child pornography and the nefarious trade in\r\nbody parts of children.\r\nThe rights, education and empowerment of women\r\naround the world are of special importance to the United\r\nNations and to the world, as they have everything to do\r\nwith some of mankind’s most vital concerns — the health\r\nand education of children, the advancement of the\r\neconomy, the preservation of the environment and the\r\nmanagement of the country’s and the world’s population.\r\nWe in the Philippines look forward to the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, and call for the inclusion\r\nin its platform of action of measures for the protection\r\nand advancement of women’s rights, particularly of\r\nwomen in positions of great vulnerability, including\r\nwomen migrant workers, women refugees, and minority\r\nwomen. We also call upon the Ninth United Nations\r\nCongress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment\r\nof Offenders to take steps towards making gender-based\r\nviolence a crime, especially violence against women\r\nmigrant workers and the victims of the traffic in women.\r\nUnderlying the need to safeguard the welfare of\r\nthese vulnerable groups is the fundamental issue of\r\nhuman rights, the issue of respect for all people and their\r\nrights, the issue of their inherent equality as human\r\nbeings. The United Nations has adopted numerous\r\ninternational instruments on human rights, beginning with\r\nthe Universal Declaration. The Philippines is party to 21\r\nof these.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nThe United Nations must renew its commitment to\r\nfoster compliance with these solemn covenants, always with\r\nrespect for the sovereignty of nations. Since the concept of\r\nthe inherent rights and equality of human persons resides in\r\nthe minds of people, United Nations efforts in this regard\r\nmust begin with education. As our Constitution proclaims,\r\nhuman-rights education is itself a human right.\r\nOur delegation reaffirms its full support for a proposal\r\nintroduced last year for the declaration of a United Nations\r\ndecade on human rights education. At the same time, the\r\nUnited Nations human rights machinery must be\r\nstrengthened, particularly the new office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human\r\nRights.\r\nEven as we refocus our concerns on basic human\r\nneeds, we should not lose sight of the continuing, and even\r\nincreased, importance of peace-keeping in the mandate of\r\nthe United Nations. We must, however, make sure that the\r\npeace-keeping function does not divert resources from\r\neconomic and social development, is not used by the major\r\nPowers simply to pursue their respective agendas, and is\r\ncarried out in a transparent and democratic manner.\r\nThe Philippines fully supports an approach to\r\ninternational peace and security that is based on securing\r\nfriendly relations among peoples of different political,\r\ncultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds, respect for\r\ninternational law, and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nWe believe that the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity should not rest primarily on the use or threat of\r\nsanctions, armed force, or other coercive measures. Nor\r\nshould peace-keeping operations, important as they are, take\r\nthe place of the political settlement of disputes.\r\nIn light of this, and because of the growing number\r\nand complexity of United Nations peace-keeping operations,\r\nwe in the United Nations have to agree on a set of guiding\r\nprinciples for the establishment and conduct of such\r\noperations. Such a set of guidelines would not only\r\ncontribute to the effectiveness of the peace-keeping\r\noperations but also broaden the base of active support for\r\nthem. The maintenance of international peace and security\r\nis a collective responsibility. The United Nations must\r\nensure the international nature of all peace-keeping\r\noperations if it is to maintain their credibility.\r\nIt is in this spirit that we approach the live question of\r\nthe reform of the Security Council. It is ironic that, in the\r\nmidst of the rapid spread of democracy within nations in\r\nrecent years and the expanding membership of the United\r\nNations, the Security Council remains unrepresentative in\r\nits size and in the geographic distribution of its\r\nmembership and undemocratic in its decision-making and\r\nworking methods.\r\nClearly, while the composition and methods of the\r\nSecurity Council must reflect the realities of political and\r\neconomic power, we have to redress the imbalance in its\r\ncomposition and increase the participation of the general\r\nmembership and other United Nations organs in its\r\ndecision-making, if we are to enhance its effectiveness\r\nand its accountability. This would involve both enlarging\r\nthe Council’s membership and reforming its methods and\r\nprocedures.\r\nSpecifically, we believe that the Council’s\r\nmembership should be better balanced in terms of\r\ngeographic distribution and increased representation of the\r\ndeveloping countries. At the same time, the Security\r\nCouncil has to improve the transparency of its working\r\nmethods and decision-making processes, which, in turn,\r\nwould enhance its working relationship with the general\r\nmembership and the other principal organs of the United\r\nNations, especially the General Assembly. We look\r\nforward to early action on this aspiration by the working\r\ngroup of the General Assembly dealing with the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council and related matters.\r\nThe General Assembly, for its part, must revitalize\r\nitself if it is to carry out its functions and discharge its\r\nresponsibilities under the Charter, including those\r\npertaining to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity in which it must assert its role as the only\r\nprincipal organ with universal membership. In the past\r\ntwo years, the General Assembly adopted two resolutions\r\nto this effect. Let us begin implementing their key\r\nprovisions.\r\nRevitalization of the United Nations is demanded by\r\nthe new circumstances and challenges of today’s dynamic\r\nworld. Let us, at the very least, do our very best to\r\nuphold and strengthen the principle of universality in our\r\nOrganization.\r\nIt is in the interest of revitalizing the United Nations\r\nthat the effective management of the Organization\r\nassumes enormous importance. The Philippine delegation\r\nwelcomes the creation by the General Assembly of the\r\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services. We suggest,\r\nhowever, that the Assembly consider the possible\r\nestablishment of an independent advisory group to\r\noversee the work and receive the reports of this Office.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nThis would provide the checks and balances so necessary\r\nin a large organization such as the United Nations.\r\nAs the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\napproaches, we must ensure that the balance is maintained\r\namong the principal concerns of the Organization — the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security, the promotion of\r\neconomic progress and the advancement of social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nBecause it has lagged behind the first two of the\r\npreoccupations of the United Nations, I suggest that we\r\nnow pay closer attention and turn our efforts more to the\r\nthird of our Organization’s principal concerns — the social\r\ncomponent of the basic needs of the human community and\r\nthe human person.\r\nAs we approach this important milestone of the\r\nOrganization, it is altogether fitting that we focus the work\r\nof the United Nations on the human person and society,\r\nwhose interest and welfare, after all, are the ultimate reason\r\nfor the existence of the United Nations and the final\r\nobjective of its works.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Rashid Abdullah\r\nAl-Noaimi.\r\nMr. Al-Noaimi (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): On behalf of the delegation of the United\r\nArab Emirates it gives me pleasure to extend to the\r\nPresident our congratulations on his election to the\r\npresidency of the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. This is a clear recognition by the international\r\ncommunity of his wisdom, diplomatic skills and a sign of\r\nesteem for his country, Côte d’Ivoire. We would also like\r\nto pay tribute to his predecessor, Ambassador Insanally, for\r\nhis efforts and his efficiency in steering the deliberations of\r\nthe last session. In this connection, we salute the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\nefforts aimed at improving the work of the Organization\r\nand its efficiency so that it may face up to the challenges\r\nand changes of today’s world.\r\nOn this occasion, I am happy to welcome the return of\r\nSouth Africa to the fold of the international community.\r\nWe are fully confident that by its return, it will effectively\r\ncontribute to enhancing the work of the Organization.\r\nThe end of the cold war has created a new climate in\r\ninternational relations as better prospects have emerged\r\nwhich promise to make possible the achievement of\r\ntangible progress towards finding solutions for a number\r\nof international problems. Such encouraging\r\ndevelopments afford unprecedented opportunities for\r\ninternational cooperation in the interests of peace,\r\nsecurity, stability and sustainable development. At the\r\nsame time, we must take stock of the new realities that\r\nhave emerged on the international scene.\r\nIn a number of regions, the escalation of wars and\r\nregional conflicts poses a serious threat to international\r\nand regional peace and security and has led to a state of\r\neconomic, social and developmental instability. New\r\nforms of racism, nationalism and religious fanaticism\r\nhave emerged, and acts of violence and terrorism in all its\r\nforms take place. All these situations and factors impede\r\nthe building of the better world of peace, coexistence,\r\ntolerance and prosperity after which humanity aspires.\r\nThis makes it clear that the tasks the United Nations\r\nundertakes in performing its role in such areas as the\r\nresolution of conflicts, peace building and the prevention\r\nof regional conflicts are not easy, given the complex\r\nnature of the problems of today’s world which differ from\r\nthose of yesterday’s world. Therefore, we must intensify\r\nour efforts in support of what the Secretary-General has\r\nproposed in his report “An Agenda for Peace”, in order\r\nfor that agenda to be translated into a concrete reality. I\r\nrefer in particular to the proposals concerning the\r\nstrengthening of cooperation, partnership and coordination\r\nbetween regional organizations and the United Nations, in\r\nline with the provisions of the Charter and the rules and\r\nnorms of international law. I should mention in particular\r\nthe organizations associated with our region, such as the\r\nGulf Cooperation Council, the League of Arab States and\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, all of which\r\npossess a good deal of comprehensive knowledge of the\r\naffairs of the region and the nature of its problems.\r\nIn the current international situation, it is important\r\nto reconsider the question of reforming the structure of\r\nthe United Nations — particularly the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly — in accordance with the\r\nCharter, so that, in the exercise of their functions, they\r\nmay respond and adapt to the nature of the current world\r\nsituation. The responsibilities of the Security Council\r\nhave greatly increased over the past few years. This fact\r\nmakes it necessary to ensure greater participation by all\r\nMember States, taking into account the fact that equitable\r\nand just geographic and regional distribution would\r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international and regional\r\npeace and security.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nDevelopments in international and regional situations\r\nover the past years have made it clear that radical solutions\r\nto regional disputes can be reached only by peaceful means,\r\nthrough dialogue and negotiation between countries in\r\naccordance with the United Nations Charter and the rules\r\nand norms of international law. Proceeding from this, the\r\npolicy of the United Arab Emirates is based on full and\r\nmutual respect for States’ sovereignty and independence\r\nand for the principles of non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of other States, good-neighbourliness and peaceful\r\ncoexistence.\r\nThus, throughout the years, we have had a sincere\r\ndesire to conduct direct negotiations with the Government\r\nof Iran with a view to the restoration of our full sovereignty\r\nover our three Islands — namely, Lesser Tumb, Greater\r\nTumb and Abu Moussa, which were militarily occupied by\r\nIran in 1971, an action which we consider to be illegal and\r\nin breach of the United Nations Charter and the rules of\r\ninternational law.\r\nOn a number of occasions, my country has declared\r\nfrom this rostrum its complete readiness to settle this\r\ndispute by peaceful means. Hence the initiative by the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates which called for serious and direct\r\nnegotiations to put an end to the Iranian occupation of our\r\nthree islands. This stance on our part stemmed not only\r\nfrom the nature of the traditional and historic relations\r\nbetween the two countries and from the current trends on\r\nthe international scene in dealing with issues of peace and\r\nsecurity, but also from our adherence to the principles and\r\ntenets of the Islamic Sharia’a, the provisions of the Charter\r\nand the rules of international law.\r\nOwing to the Islamic Republic of Iran’s failure to\r\nrespond to all these endeavors and initiatives on the\r\nquestion of the three Islands of the Emirates, the\r\nGovernment of my country has declared its full readiness\r\nto put the issue before the International Court of Justice\r\nwhich is the judicial organ competent to settle disputes\r\nbetween States. My Country is pledged to accepting all\r\nthat follows from the Judgment of the International Court\r\nas that Judgment would be based on legal arguments and\r\ndocuments.\r\nThis initiative was supported by our sister countries of\r\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as by Arab and by\r\nother friendly countries. We hope that the international\r\ncommunity will support this peaceful initiative, which is\r\nbased on international legality.\r\nFurthermore, the United Arab Emirates hopes that\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran would share this sincere\r\ndesire and respond to our serious initiative, especially as\r\nthe Government of Iran has on previous occasions — I\r\nrefer to disputes in respect of which the Court was likely\r\nto rule in Iran’s favour — had recourse to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and accepted its Judgments.\r\nWe are confident that this initiative will help to achieve\r\nan atmosphere of stability and security in the region and\r\nwill enhance peaceful coexistence and mutual respect\r\namongst its States and thereby enable them to channel\r\ntheir energies and resources towards the achievement of\r\nthe socio-economic development for which they stand in\r\ndire need after so many years of conflict and war.\r\nAlthough almost four years have elapsed since the\r\nliberation of the sisterly State of Kuwait, the Iraqi regime\r\nis still being selective in its implementation of the\r\nrelevant resolutions of international legality, indifferent to\r\nthe serious consequences. In addition, it is using delaying\r\ntactics and procrastination, instead of cooperating by\r\nreleasing hundreds of hostages and detainees from Kuwait\r\nand other countries.\r\nWhile we in the United Arab Emirates, with our\r\nbrethren in the Gulf Cooperation Council, affirm the\r\nneed to uphold the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq,\r\nwe consider the international resolutions operative and\r\nmandatory. Thus, we demand that the Iraqi regime abide\r\nby its legal and political obligations, as stipulated in the\r\nSecurity Council resolutions related to its aggression\r\nagainst Kuwait — in particular, resolution 687 (1991)\r\nconcerning respect for the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of Kuwait; and resolution 833 (1993), which\r\ndetermines the demarcation of international borders\r\nbetween Kuwait and Iraq in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of Chapter VII of the Charter. Short of the\r\nimplementation of both these resolutions, there cannot be\r\na positive climate conducive to peace and security in the\r\nregion.\r\nThe peace dividend, the product of the atmosphere\r\nof international cooperation in the wake of the Cold War\r\nera, has increasingly come to determine the characteristics\r\nand parameters of a new world order based on regional\r\ncooperation, for whose success peace is considered an\r\nindispensable prerequisite. Proceeding from this, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates was one of the countries that\r\nwelcomed the holding of the Madrid Peace Conference\r\nand the conduct of bilateral negotiations. This was also\r\nthe reason why my country participated in the multilateral\r\nnegotiations.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nWhile we considered the Declaration of Principles and\r\nthe agreements that followed on the Palestinian and\r\nJordanian tracks as the first real steps of detente in the\r\nArab-Israeli dispute and the Question of Palestine based on\r\ninternational legality as represented in the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions, particularly Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) on the\r\nIsraeli withdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian and\r\nArab territories, including Al-Quds Al-Shareef, the Syrian\r\nGolan and southern Lebanon, at the same time we affirm\r\nthe necessity of attaining positive results on the Syrian and\r\nLebanese tracks based on these resolutions and on the\r\nprinciples and the premises that were agreed upon in\r\nMadrid Peace Conference, namely the land-for-peace\r\nprinciple.\r\nMy country, which pins its hopes on the success of the\r\nnational reconciliation conference in Somalia within the\r\nterms of the Nairobi Declaration, is still concerned about\r\nthe deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation\r\nand the obstruction of the distribution of relief supplies to\r\nthe suffering people of this sisterly country. We did not\r\nhesitate to grant humanitarian assistance in addition to our\r\nparticipation in the United Nations Operation in Somalia\r\n(UNOSOM II).\r\nWe think that the international relief efforts cannot be\r\nsuccessful in the worsening internal situation. Therefore,\r\nthe major responsibility lies with the Somali leaders\r\nthemselves to formulate a serious response to mediation\r\nefforts aimed at the political settlement and national\r\nreconciliation, without which their country will not be\r\nsaved, its reconstruction will not be achieved and the\r\nrehabilitation of its people will not take place or pave the\r\nway for Somalia’s return as an active member of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMy country is deeply concerned over the situation in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, particularly under the\r\ncircumstances of the continued violation of its sovereignty\r\nand of the human rights of its people, especially the\r\nMuslims. The facts still indicate that Bosnian Serb forces\r\nand their supporters have not refrained for a single day\r\nfrom their acts of aggression or from perpetrating further\r\ncrimes of ethnic cleansing and genocide. To the contrary,\r\nthey have gone to great lengths in defying the international\r\nwill and have even attacked United Nations personnel.\r\nThese Serbian actions aim at regional expansionist gains\r\nthat violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nAlthough the United Arab Emirates has continued to\r\ncall upon the international community since the eruption\r\nof this crisis to take serious measures that could restore\r\ndignity, security and stability to that country, yet, after 30\r\nmonths, we are obliged to reiterate our call, in the\r\nstrongest possible terms, to the international community,\r\nparticularly the Security Council, to reconsider the\r\nmanner it has opted for in dealing with the question of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The Council must once again\r\ntake firmer measures against the Serbian aggressor in\r\naccordance with Article 42 of Chapter VII of the Charter,\r\nand in a manner that would achieve a just negotiated\r\nsettlement.\r\nAt the same time, we reiterate our previous call for\r\nthe lifting of the arms embargo imposed on the Republic\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina by Security Council resolution\r\n713 (1991) so that the people of that country may be able\r\nto defend themselves in accordance with Article 51 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nIn view of the rapid developments in international\r\nrelations at the end of the Cold War era, the international\r\nsituation necessitates an early settlement of the problems\r\nleft behind by that era. This will be realized only through\r\na general orientation towards disarmament in all its forms,\r\ncovering both nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Thus, we look forward to the 1995\r\nConference on the Review and Revision of the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty, hoping that that Conference will\r\nproduce confidence-building measures on the regional and\r\ninternational levels that would create zones free from\r\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons,\r\nparticularly in the Middle East region, which has been\r\nplagued by conflict for a long period of time.\r\nDespite progress in the Arab-Israeli peace\r\nnegotiations, we are deeply concerned over Israel’s\r\nacquisition of an immense nuclear capability, which\r\nconstitutes a constant and continued threat to the security\r\nof the countries and peoples of the region, hampers the\r\nrealization of the comprehensive objectives of these\r\nnegotiations and will also endanger international peace.\r\nWhile social issues are now at the forefront of\r\ninternational relations, the economic and developmental\r\nquestions of developing countries are increasingly\r\nmarginalized, and the economic disparities between\r\ndeveloping and developed countries continues to widen as\r\na result of the measures taken by developed countries.\r\nThe exports of developing countries are still impeded by\r\nprotectionist measures, and their efforts for development\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nare threatened by the burden of foreign indebtedness,\r\nreverse financial flows in addition to the constant decline in\r\nthe price of commodities, on which most of developing\r\ncountries depend as a major source of national income, as\r\nwell as the general deterioration in the terms of trade and\r\nfinance of the developing countries themselves.\r\nThe persistence of these problems and the absence of\r\na solution will lead to political and social tensions, which\r\nin turn will adversely affect international and regional peace\r\nand security.\r\nThe nature of these problems requires us to reconsider\r\nthe structure of the current international social and\r\neconomic relations with two approaches. The first includes\r\nthe development of new measures and mechanisms for\r\ncooperation amongst the countries of the North and the\r\nSouth, and the second hinges on finding a strategy for\r\neconomic integration that addresses the elements of\r\ndevelopmental deficit among the countries of the South in\r\na way that ensures the realization of socio-economic\r\nimprovements in the process of sustainable development,\r\nand alleviates the concerns of the countries of the South\r\nvis-à-vis implementation of their immediate and medium-\r\nterm development plans.\r\nInternational economic integration has become a\r\nconcrete reality that must be taken into account. This\r\nconcept has been recently endorsed by the agreement of\r\na majority of countries to the establishment of the World\r\nTrade Organization in Marakesh in sisterly Morocco on\r\n15 April 1994. There can be no doubt that this is a\r\nhistoric event and gives new momentum to the world\r\neconomy. We hope that the setting up of this new\r\norganization will be a positive beginning that improves\r\nand enhances the prospects of economic, financial and\r\ninternational trade relations based on justice, co-equality\r\nand equity, with a view to bridging the gap between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries.\r\nThe spirit of tolerance and of adherence to noble\r\ncultural and humanitarian values, to the principles and\r\npurposes of the Charter and the rules of international law\r\nshould be our beacon which guides our steps towards the\r\nfuture that we desire. Consequently, we call on Member\r\nStates to take advantage of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations and to transform it into a historic occasion\r\nfor a comprehensive review and for ushering in a bright\r\nfuture of stability, security and coexistence prevail for all\r\npeoples and countries of the world.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
