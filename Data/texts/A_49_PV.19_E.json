(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 112\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/49/400/Add.2)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In a\r\nletter contained in document A/49/400/Add.2 the Secretary-\r\nGeneral informs me that, since the issuance of his\r\ncommunications dated 20 and 26 September, Burkina Faso\r\nhas made the necessary payment to reduce its arrears below\r\nthe amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ange-Félix Patasse, President of the\r\nCentral African Republic\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nCentral African Republic.\r\nMr. Ange-Félix Patasse, President of the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nCentral African Republic, His Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix\r\nPatasse, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Patasse (interpretation from French):\r\nThe delegation of the new Central African Republic,\r\nwhich is attending a session of the General Assembly for\r\nthe first time, is pleased to be here and expresses to you,\r\nMr. President, and all other representatives, its warmest\r\ngreetings and the best wishes of the Government and\r\npeople of the Central African Republic.\r\nIt is with pride that my delegation sees you,\r\nMr. President, guiding the General Assembly’s\r\nproceedings at its forty-ninth session. Your well-deserved\r\nelection, which honours all of Africa, is a tribute to your\r\ncountry, Côte d’Ivoire, with which the Central African\r\nRepublic enjoys excellent relations of friendship,\r\nfraternity and cooperation.\r\nSince 1994 has been called the year of Africa, my\r\ndelegation and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\r\nmemory of the late President Houphouët-Boigny.\r\nWe welcome the presence in this Hall of the sister\r\nRepublic of South Africa, and we congratulate it on the\r\narrival of democracy there.\r\nIt is with genuine pleasure that my Government\r\ncongratulates the President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-eighth session, Mr. Samuel Rudolph Insanally, and\r\ncommends him for the competent and intelligent way in\r\nwhich he discharged his mandate.\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nWe also congratulate the Secretary-General, a worthy\r\nson of Africa, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who, as head of\r\nthe Organization, made the preparations for the year of\r\nAfrica. His admirable dynamism, realism, patience and\r\nwisdom have effectively helped to contain many\r\ninternational problems, despite meagre resources. We wish\r\nto reiterate our firm support for him and our best wishes for\r\nevery success in his multifaceted initiatives for peace,\r\nsecurity and development.\r\nIn the wake of the Second World War the United\r\nNations was created as a successor to the League of\r\nNations. It set itself the objective of, inter alia, settling of\r\ndisputes in order to promote the economic, social and\r\ncultural development of nations.\r\nWhat has happened since that time? The world was\r\ndivided into two camps — one capitalist, the other\r\ncommunist — while in between the two the third-world\r\ncountries described as non-aligned gradually achieved\r\ninternational sovereignty. This situation led to the advent\r\nof regimes born of military coups d’état in almost all the\r\ncountries of the third world, especially in Africa. Those\r\nmilitary regimes, which were anti-democratic because they\r\nwere not elected, seized power and held freedom hostage,\r\nthereby curtailing the economic, social and cultural\r\ndevelopment of our nations. They plunged their\r\npopulations into unprecedented impoverishment.\r\nWhile the international community and the wealthy\r\ncountries indulged and fostered this policy of domination,\r\nwaste, corruption and mismanagement, the colonized and\r\ndominated populations fought unceasingly for access to\r\ndemocracy, the basis of all development. At last, near the\r\nend of 1990, the populations’ cries of alarm were heard by\r\nthe international community, which then quickly facilitated\r\nthe third world’s access to democracy.\r\nA new era dawned, starting in the East, where\r\ncommunism crumbled. The wind from the East blew\r\nthrough the African continent, where exhausted and\r\ntraumatized populations accepted unprecedented sacrifices\r\nand waged a ruthless battle against the military regimes in\r\npower.\r\nCertain African countries opted for the formula of\r\nsovereign national conferences, while others chose free,\r\ndemocratic and transparent elections. The Central African\r\npeople resolutely chose the latter path, at all cost.\r\nIn this context, the Central African Republic, which I\r\nrepresent today at the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly, elected me President, Head of State of the\r\nRepublic, in a setting of serenity and transparency, and\r\nover eight other candidates who enjoyed broad support\r\nfrom abroad. This was a victory not only for me and my\r\nParty but also for the entire Central African people. It\r\nwas a victory won through change in favour of a new and\r\ntruly democratic Republic.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank earnestly, once again,\r\nthe friendly countries and international institutions that\r\nparticipated unfailingly in the process of democratizing\r\nthe Central African Republic. I would like to mention in\r\nparticular France, the United States of America, Germany,\r\nJapan, the Republic of China in Taiwan, the European\r\nUnion, the World Bank and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP).\r\nThe Central African Republic would like to base its\r\nhopes on the concrete decisions that the General\r\nAssembly will be taking to eradicate the last remaining\r\nhotbeds of tension in the world at large and in Africa in\r\nparticular.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Burundi, Angola,\r\nLiberia and other countries must find peace again, as did\r\nSouth Africa — and we welcome the presence here of\r\nSouth Africa’s hero: the illustrious, democratically\r\nelected President, His Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela,\r\nbeacon of the struggle against apartheid and for a new,\r\nmulti-racial and fraternal South Africa.\r\nIn this context, firmly convinced of the importance\r\nof humanitarian action in Rwanda, we supported\r\nunhesitatingly the helpful intervention of France, whose\r\ncourage and determination we extol. That intervention\r\ncurbed human suffering and restored peace to Rwanda.\r\nI also take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of\r\nmy country, congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Bill\r\nClinton, President of the United States of America, and to\r\nthe American people for their intervention in Haiti aimed\r\nat restoring democracy and returning the democratically\r\nelected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to office.\r\nAt its forty-ninth session the General Assembly must\r\ntake concrete and urgent measures to prevent and contain\r\nconflicts by establishing and strengthening legal\r\ninstruments. For weapons have never provided any\r\nlasting solutions. It is only if these legal instruments are\r\nestablished that the so-called poor countries will be able\r\nto begin to lay the foundations of their economic, social\r\nand cultural development in peace and tranquillity and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nthat the intervention of the international community and the\r\nwealthy countries will be only complementary.\r\nAs to the Central African Republic, since my election\r\non 27 September 1993, we have endeavoured to lay the\r\ngroundwork for real democracy by giving priority to\r\ndialogue and concord between all the sectors of the Central\r\nAfrican nation.\r\nA truly democratic constitution, which reflects the\r\nprofound aspirations of my people, is being drafted and will\r\nsoon be submitted to a referendum, in December 1994.\r\nThis constitution, which is the result of a broad consensus,\r\nplaces great emphasis on justice, on fundamental freedoms,\r\nand on social and family well-being achieved through work.\r\nIt applies the mechanism of decentralization, along\r\nwith its corollary, regionalization in order, on the one hand,\r\nto bring the people closer while, on the other, to mobilize\r\nall available local resources for the agro-industrial\r\nprocessing of raw materials and mineral resources, for our\r\nsubsoil is very rich, so as to improve the standard of living\r\nin the countryside and the provinces.\r\nHow will the Central African Republic, a land-locked\r\ncountry, accomplish such a programme if its neighbours,\r\nthe countries of its subregion, are not at peace? A good\r\nportion of our exported and imported goods pass through\r\nneighbouring countries such as Cameroon and Congo.\r\nFurthermore, at the domestic level, the work of our\r\npeaceful peasants is systematically undermined by a\r\nphenomenon known as “zaraguinas”, or those who block\r\nthe road. These “zaraguinas” are simply a reflection of the\r\npolitical and military situation of our neighbours.\r\nThe General Assembly will understand why the\r\nCentral African Republic agreed to act as mediator between\r\nthe Government of Chad and a politico-military group with\r\na view to restoring peace to that fraternal country in its\r\nnorthern sector. This is because peace in Chad, in\r\nCameroon, in Congo, in Sudan and in Zaire will allow the\r\nCentral African Republic to develop harmoniously,\r\npromoting a dynamic and fruitful policy of good-\r\nneighbourliness and of the complementarity we require.\r\nMy country has embarked on the path of mediation\r\nbetween the parties in Chad because it believes in the\r\nvirtues of dialogue and harmony in a spirit of tolerance and\r\nunity within a diversity of political opinions.\r\nToday, the agreement reached between the\r\nGovernment of Chad and the National Salvation Council for\r\nPeace and Democracy in Chad (CSNPDT) of Moise Kette\r\nNodji is entering the stage of implementation in the field,\r\nthanks to the follow-up committee of Bangui II, since this\r\nKette movement, which in the past was a politico-military\r\nmovement, has now basically become a political party of\r\na conventional type, which is officially recognized.\r\nThe Government of Chad, on the initiative of the\r\nmediator, has just announced an amnesty for the\r\ncombatants of the CSNPDT in order to rebuild confidence\r\namong all Chadians and to create conditions conducive to\r\ngenuine reconciliation within Chad before the forthcoming\r\nelections in the country.\r\nWe are also prepared to make our contribution to the\r\nsettlement of internal conflicts in those neighbouring\r\ncountries that have appealed to us for assistance.\r\nI have elaborated on the major problems of concern\r\nto my country, the Central African Republic, and also\r\nthose of neighbouring countries as concerns lasting peace\r\nin Central Africa and in the world at large, and the\r\nAssembly will understand that I am deeply committed to\r\nrespect for human rights and for the rule of law. I am a\r\nfree man, and I say what I believe. I tell the truth,\r\nbecause the truth makes one free. I am a biologist, and\r\nI know that a good metabolism requires both\r\nmacro-elements and oligo-elements.\r\nTherefore, it is impossible to claim respect for\r\nhuman rights and for the rights of nations if, in one way\r\nor another, we promote discrimination for whatever\r\nreason.\r\nIn the past, it was discrimination between the East\r\nand West blocs, whose consequences, in the form of the\r\ncold war, plunged a large part of mankind into a\r\ncatastrophic situation. In the past, it was discrimination\r\nbetween the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization. In the past, it was racial discrimination in\r\nSouth Africa. Today, we still see discrimination:\r\nbetween the People’s Republic of China and the Republic\r\nof China in Taiwan.\r\nAnd yet, the Berlin Wall has fallen, as did the walls\r\nof Jericho in days gone by, marking the end of the East-\r\nWest bloc system. The conflict between Israelis and\r\nPalestinians has yielded to coexistence between the State\r\nof Israel and the State of Palestine. The criminal\r\nfoundations of apartheid have crumbled and given way to\r\na new, democratic South Africa with a human face.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nWhy not today help the two Chinas to overcome their\r\ntemporary divergences, which arise out of past history, in\r\norder that China might be reconciled with itself in the\r\nhigher interests of the Chinese people and of the peoples\r\nthat are friends of the two Chinas? Why exclude the\r\nRepublic of China in Taiwan from the great family of the\r\ninternational community? Why reject a State that has\r\n21 million inhabitants? Where is our respect for them?\r\nWhy encourage the conflict between the Chinas, when we\r\nknow that the two exchange technologies and complement\r\neach other?\r\nFor my part, and on behalf of the Central African\r\nRepublic, I reaffirm that we intend to maintain diplomatic,\r\neconomic, cultural and social relations with the two Chinese\r\nStates without restriction. The choice resides solely with\r\nthe People’s Republic of China or the Republic of China in\r\nTaiwan.\r\nThe same applies to the two Koreas, because we want\r\nto benefit from the technology of all these friendly\r\ncountries for our development. Towards this end, we base\r\nourselves on the fundamental principle of the United\r\nNations Charter: there are no large nations; there are no\r\nsmall nations.\r\nThat is why my country, a co-sponsor of the draft\r\nresolution on the “Consideration of the exceptional situation\r\nof the Republic of China in Taiwan in the international\r\ncontext, based on the principle of universality and in\r\naccordance with the established model of parallel\r\nrepresentation of divided countries at the United Nations”,\r\ndeeply regrets that this item was not placed on the agenda\r\nof the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The\r\nrace towards the great market of the People’s Republic of\r\nChina should not obscure the problems of discrimination\r\nthat exist between the Chinese peoples. I am still\r\nconvinced that patience and wisdom will prevail one day,\r\nas they have recently in many of the countries we\r\nmentioned earlier.\r\nOur Organization will soon celebrate its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. It is appropriate at this time to draw up the\r\nbalance-sheet for this half-century and conduct a real\r\nassessment in order to set general policy guidelines for the\r\nyears to come. Loyal to our policy of decentralization in\r\nCentral Africa, we would also propose that the Assembly\r\nbe decentralized at the level of each continent, and that it\r\nhold its sessions in New York only every two or three\r\nyears, in accordance with a mechanism to be established\r\nafter a study by experts. In this way, the other bodies of\r\nthe United Nations system would also be brought closer\r\nto the peoples of the different continents.\r\nAs regards the Security Council, Africa has achieved\r\nmaturity, and, with one third of the world’s population, is\r\nentitled to a permanent seat and also to the right of veto.\r\nThis is the proposal for adaptation to present circumstance\r\nthat we draw to the Assembly’s attention.\r\nBefore concluding my statement, I should like to\r\nremind to General Assembly that the late Barthélemy\r\nBoganda, founding President of the Central African\r\nRepublic, had a prophetic vision of the development of\r\nthe African continent. He proposed regrouping States into\r\npolitical and economic entities, with a view to launching\r\nthe economy of the African countries at the subregional\r\nand regional levels. The guiding idea was to establish the\r\nUnited States of Africa. Unfortunately, those ideas,\r\nwhich were put forward at such an early date by the late\r\nBarthélemy Boganda, were not well understood by his\r\npeers and therefore were systematically fought and\r\ndiscarded. The individual countries, out of national\r\nchauvinism and egoism, chose to make their own way.\r\nToday, Africa has regressed. It is absent at the\r\ninternational level as regards trade and industrial and\r\nagro-industrial development. And yet Africa has a wealth\r\nof all kinds of raw materials. Why have our economies\r\nbecome so fragile? Why have our education and training\r\nsystems not attained their objectives — true technical,\r\nscientific and socio-professional instruction, the essential\r\nbasis for a real policy of reconstruction in our countries,\r\nwhich are in an unprecedented state of dilapidation? Why\r\ndo our health-care systems no longer meet the aspirations\r\nof our populations? Why are our roads in such a state of\r\ndisrepair that it is virtually impossible to travel freely\r\nfrom one country to another? In a word, why must we\r\nstart all over?\r\nAll this has happened because of different\r\nideologies, based on the selfish interests of individual\r\nnations. It is also due to a lack of active solidarity\r\namong African nations.\r\nContrary to other regions of the world, where there\r\nare clear signs of the resumption of economic growth, the\r\npersistence of poor economic results in Africa remains a\r\nsource of concern and of constant disquiet. In fact, at the\r\npresent time, Africa accounts for under 2 per cent of\r\ninternational trade transactions. It is being crushed under\r\nthe weight of debt, and various programmes for structural\r\nadjustment have done nothing to change the worsening\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nstandard of living of the entire continent, which does,\r\nhowever, have an enormous potential in its peoples and its\r\nnature.\r\nThe trend towards a decline in the prices of raw\r\nmaterials and commodities is continuing inexorably, and the\r\ntransfer of technology is proceeding in an unsatisfactory\r\nmanner, placing Africa on the sidelines. What we need to\r\nsave the continent is a real Marshall Plan, because at the\r\npresent time multilateral and bilateral assistance remain\r\ninsufficient to promote sustained and lasting growth.\r\nWithout this growth, which is necessary to raise the\r\nAfrican people’s standard of living, lasting peace can be\r\nonly an illusion. In a word, the Central African Republic\r\nappeals for international solidarity in favour of the poorest\r\ncountries, with a view to the relaunching of their\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn this context, my country expresses the hope that\r\nthis session will mark a new stage in effective cooperation\r\nfor progress and peace in the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Central African Republic believes that tolerance\r\nand peace for development must henceforward be the motto\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nLong live the General Assembly!\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Central African Republic for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Ange-Félix Patasse, President of the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The next\r\nspeaker is the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, His Excellency\r\nMr. Choi Su Hon.\r\nMr. Choi Su Hon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea) (spoke in Korean; English text furnished by the\r\ndelegation): Mr. President, allow me first of all, on behalf\r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, to convey\r\nto you our congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly. We hope that under\r\nyour presidency the General Assembly will bring its work\r\nto a fruitful conclusion.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express our\r\nappreciation of the activities and efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations and enhance its\r\nresponsibility and its role.\r\nBefore I begin my statement, allow me also to\r\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General, to the\r\nSecretariat of the United Nations, and to the specialized\r\nagencies and other organizations in the United Nations\r\nsystem for the deep condolences they expressed on the\r\ndemise of our respected leader, Comrade Kim Il Sung,\r\nformer President of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to extend our\r\nprofound thanks to the Heads of State or Government, to\r\nthe Governments and to the peoples of different countries\r\nfor their messages of deep condolence and consolation as\r\nwell as for their arrangement of services of mourning for\r\nour great leader.\r\nOur respected President Kim Il Sung devoted his\r\nefforts, throughout his life, to ensuring the prosperity of\r\nour motherland and to the freedom and happiness of its\r\npeople and to world peace and the progress of humanity.\r\nOur leader’s passing is a very great loss and profound\r\ngrief for our nation. He performed immortal exploits,\r\nwhich will go down in the annals of history through his\r\ntireless and energetic activities from his early years to the\r\nadvanced age of over 80. Although the heart of our leader\r\nhas ceased to beat, his great exploits will be remembered\r\nfor ever. Our great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung will\r\nalways be with us.\r\nDespite the greatest loss that our nation has suffered\r\nin its five-thousand-year-long history, our people have\r\nbeen able to turn their grief and sorrow into strength and\r\ncourage and they have been able to rise up again, because\r\nthey have another great leader, Comrade Kim Jong Il,\r\nwho has inherited the ideology, the qualities of leadership\r\nand the lofty virtues of our paternal leader.\r\nOur dear leader Comrade Kim Jong Il is the supreme\r\nleader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and\r\nthe Supreme Commander of its revolutionary armed\r\nforces. A man of literary and military accomplishments,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nof loyalty and filial piety, a man perfectly endowed with\r\nthe qualities and traits of leadership, Comrade Kim Jong Il\r\nenjoys the greatest respect and the absolute confidence of\r\nour people, who have entrusted him with their destiny and\r\ntheir future.\r\nOur society is characterized by the close unity between\r\nthe leader and the people in a socialist system centred upon\r\nthe popular masses, a system which they have chosen and\r\nwhich they have built on their own.\r\nOur dear leader Comrade Kim Jong Il remains\r\ncommitted to his life-long mission of carrying forward and\r\naccomplishing the revolutionary cause pioneered by our\r\nfatherly leader through generations and he is energetically\r\nleading the overall affairs of our party, State and armed\r\nforces. The Government of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea is firmly committed to fully carrying\r\nforward and further building on the accomplishments of the\r\nrespected leader President Kim Il Sung, and the lifetime\r\nteachings of the leader remain the guideline for our\r\nactivities. Our people will follow the wise leadership of\r\nComrade Kim Jong Il, more firmly as they arm themselves\r\nwith the Juche idea, the revolutionary idea of the respected\r\nleader Comrade Kim Il Sung, and defend, safeguard and\r\nglorify our socialism, which is their life and soul.\r\nThe lifelong desire of the great leader Comrade Kim\r\nIl Sung was the reunification of our country, and he worked\r\nenergetically until the last minute of his life for its\r\nrealization. National reunification is the patriotic cause\r\nrelated to the destiny of our nation and it is the supreme\r\ntask of our nation and one that can be delayed no longer.\r\nIt is indeed an intolerable tragedy that the division of\r\nour nation that began in the 1940s has lasted until today, at\r\na time when humanity is preparing to usher in the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nThe Government and people of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, being desirous of national\r\nreunification, have long been exerting every effort to\r\nachieve reunification on the basis of the three principles of\r\nindependence, peaceful reunification and national unity; the\r\nproposal for the establishment of a confederal State; and the\r\nTen-Point Programme for Great Unity of the Whole Nation\r\nfor the country’s reunification, serves as the common\r\nreunification programme of the nation.\r\nAs there exist different ideologies and political systems\r\nin the north and the south of Korea, the establishment of a\r\nconfederation based on the concept of one nation and one\r\nState, two systems and two governments, is the only way\r\nto achieve reunification on the basis of the principle of\r\nneither side conquering or being conquered by the other.\r\nThis is the cardinal principle for reunification that\r\ncorresponds to current reality existing in the Korean\r\npeninsula.\r\nThe major stumbling-blocks to humanitarian\r\nexchanges, dialogue and contacts between the north and\r\nsouth are South Korea’s so-called “National Security\r\nLaw”, which defines fellow countrymen as enemies, and\r\nthe concrete wall, a symbol of division and confrontation.\r\nAll the legal and physical barriers must be removed at an\r\nearly date if we are to achieve our consistent goals of free\r\ntravel and contacts, cooperation and exchanges between\r\nthe north and the south and if we are to realize national\r\nunity. This is not only the unanimous demand of the\r\nentire Korean people and the world’s peoples but also the\r\ntrend of the times.\r\nOur nation is firm in its will and intention to achieve\r\nnational reunification in the 1990s. Our people will\r\ncertainly open the door to national reunification by\r\nachieving the unity of all Korean nationals in the north\r\nand the south and abroad on the basis of national\r\npatriotism and a spirit of national independence, thereby\r\npromoting coexistence, co-prosperity and common\r\ninterests, dispelling the fears of northward invasion and\r\nsouthward invasion and the fears of prevalence over\r\ncommunism and of communization and by working\r\ntogether to establish an independent, peaceful, neutral,\r\nreunified State transcending the differences in doctrines\r\nand views.\r\nAn important point in defusing the tensions and\r\nbringing about peace on the Korean peninsula is to\r\nreplace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace\r\nagreement and to establish a new peace arrangement to\r\nreplace the current armistice mechanism. The Korean\r\nArmistice Agreement is a provisional step that envisages\r\nthe suspension of any military actions between the\r\nbelligerent parties and its subsequent conversion into a\r\npeace agreement.\r\nThe Armistice Agreement states, in paragraph 60 of\r\narticle IV, that, in order to help establish a lasting peace\r\non the Korean peninsula, a political conference of both\r\nsides should be held at a higher level. However, such a\r\npolitical conference has yet to be convened and the\r\nunstable armistice has lasted so far.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nOver the last four decades or so the Korean Armistice\r\nAgreement and the armistice mechanism have proved to be\r\nnominal and insubstantial, failing to prevent or restrain\r\narms reinforcement from outside Korea, a military build-up\r\nand large-scale military exercises. Moreover, it is\r\nanomalous in every way that the Armistice Agreement\r\nsigned in the 1950s should remain intact, even today when\r\nthe cold war is over. These facts highlight the urgent need\r\nto replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement\r\nand the existing armistice mechanism with a peace\r\narrangement.\r\nIn April this year the Government of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea made a detailed proposal to the\r\nUnited States that the two countries should begin\r\nnegotiations on an arrangement for a lasting peace to\r\nreplace the outdated armistice system. It subsequently took\r\nthe practical step of opening the representative office of the\r\nKorean People’s Army in Panmunjom as our new\r\nnegotiating body. In late August this year the Chinese\r\nGovernment announced its decision to withdraw the\r\ndelegation of the Chinese People’s Volunteers to the\r\nMilitary Armistice Commission, in view of the urgent need\r\nto substitute a new peace arrangement for the Korean\r\nArmistice Agreement, and in consideration of the current\r\nstatus of the malfunctioning Military Armistice\r\nCommission.\r\nThese measures were taken as innovative, goodwill\r\nsteps to make a breakthrough in establishing a new security\r\narrangement on the Korean peninsula, taking into\r\nconsideration the recognized international practices under\r\nwhich some countries terminated their belligerency after the\r\nSecond World War and declared peaceful relationships.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea still\r\nremains, in legal terms, in a state of belligerency with the\r\nUnited Nations, of which it is a dignified Member State.\r\nThat is because the cease-fire has lasted so long. At its\r\nthirtieth session the General Assembly, in 1975, adopted\r\nresolution 3390 B (XXX), urging the dismantling of the\r\nUnited Nations Command and the replacement of the\r\nArmistice Agreement with a peace agreement, but that\r\nresolution has not yet been implemented. The United\r\nNations should give due attention to the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea’s proposal for the establishment\r\nof a new peace arrangement and fulfil in good faith its own\r\nobligations in this regard, thus making amends for its\r\nunsavoury past vis-à-vis the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea, a Member State of the United Nations, and\r\nimplementing its own resolution.\r\nAnother very important element in defusing tensions\r\nand establishing lasting peace on the Korean peninsula\r\nwould be a fundamental resolution of the nuclear issue.\r\nThe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is a political\r\nand military issue to be resolved bilaterally by the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United\r\nStates, in view of its origin and its nature and substance.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has\r\nmaintained its firm position that the nuclear issue on the\r\nKorean peninsula should be resolved through dialogue\r\nand negotiations between the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States. Thanks to the\r\nsincere and patient efforts of the Government of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States have\r\nheld several rounds of bilateral talks, leading to the recent\r\nAgreed Statement by the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea and the United States, both of which are now\r\nworking towards its implementation. This shows that if\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the\r\nUnited States work together to resolve the issue with trust\r\nin each other, and on the principle of impartiality and\r\nequality, they will bring about a good and fruitful\r\noutcome.\r\nTo demonstrate the transparency of our nuclear\r\nactivities, we took the bold decision to replace the\r\nexisting system of graphite-moderated reactors with a\r\nsystem of light water reactors, at the sacrifice of our\r\nindependent atomic power industry. However, certain\r\nforces, which are not happy with a possible resolution of\r\nthe nuclear issue, are still resorting to pressure and threats\r\nagainst us, while peddling arguments about so-called\r\nspecial inspections — arguments that are highly\r\nprovocative to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nand have had a negative effect on the talks between it and\r\nthe United States. This is nothing but an attempt on the\r\npart of these forces to wreck the talks by any possible\r\nmeans as they enter a new stage, and to make the\r\nsituation on the Korean peninsula an extremely strained.\r\nThe Korean people are strongly independence-\r\nminded, and independence means life for the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. No threat or blackmail, no\r\npressure or sanctions, will ever work on us. Our people\r\nwill never beg for peace at the expense of our national\r\ndignity and sovereignty simply out of fear of war, and the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea will never sell\r\nout its supreme interests under pressure.\r\nThe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is one to\r\nbe resolved by the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nKorea and the United States, and no other party is entitled\r\nto intervene in this bilateral process. Intervention by any\r\nother party in their talks will only create difficulties and\r\ncomplications, and erect obstacles to the resolution of the\r\nissue, rather than help in its resolution in any way.\r\nBefore the South Korean authorities talk about the\r\n“nuclear issue”, they should refrain from creating obstacles\r\nto the progress of the talks between the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States, from\r\nencouraging confrontation between North and South and\r\nfrom aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the\r\nUnited States have now set out on the path of dialogue and\r\nnegotiations and are moving towards implementing their\r\nagreements on the final objectives of the peaceful resolution\r\nof the nuclear issue and other outstanding issues. The\r\nworld welcomes this process and looks forward to\r\nsatisfactory results. The Government of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea will continue all its sincere\r\nefforts to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula\r\nand to achieve the region’s denuclearization. I would like\r\nto take this opportunity to express our profound thanks to\r\nState leaders, Governments and peoples for their support\r\nand encouragement for the principled position and sincere\r\nefforts of the Government of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea to resolve the nuclear issue.\r\nHumankind now has the shared task of building a\r\nnew, free and peaceful world, free from domination and\r\nsubjugation. In order to build the new world which\r\nhumanity wants to see, we must eliminate, once and for all,\r\nthe legacies of the discredited cold-war era and realize the\r\ndemocratization of international society so as to enable all\r\ncountries and nations to exercise their sovereign rights on\r\nan equal basis in international forums.\r\nThe most important element in this respect is the\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations. Among the\r\nMember States of the United Nations, there are, of course,\r\nbig and small countries, and there are also old Member\r\nStates and new Member States. However, there cannot be\r\nany senior countries or junior countries, and there cannot be\r\nany dominating countries or countries to be dominated by\r\nothers. All United Nations Member States are equal\r\nMembers of the United Nations, and all contribute jointly\r\nto world peace and security.\r\nThere can be no place for individual Member States to\r\nhold privileged positions within the United Nations.\r\nCertain forces still try at international forums to trample\r\ninternational justice and the principle of impartiality\r\nunderfoot. They are attempting to openly apply a double\r\nstandard in dealing with the nuclear issue, human rights,\r\nterrorism and a number of other issues. They are\r\nbringing unreasonable pressure to bear upon those\r\ncountries that they consider to be offending them, making\r\nslanders and false charges concerning the “nuclear threat”,\r\n“human rights violations” and “terrorist States”, while\r\nthey simply wink at the wrongful actions of those\r\ncountries considered to be obedient to their directives.\r\nThese phenomena still continue undiminished.\r\nThis is a clear indication that there still remain\r\noutdated concepts and the mentality of the cold-war era,\r\nwhen the strong-arm actions and high-handed behaviour\r\nof a few countries were allowed to go unchallenged.\r\nSuch unfair and unreasonable acts and behaviour should\r\nno longer be allowed any place in international relations.\r\nRestructuring of the United Nations is important, in\r\norder to meet more actively the changed reality and new\r\nchallenges.\r\nThe non-aligned and other developing countries\r\nmake up a majority of United Nations membership. For\r\na fair and proper representation of their demands and\r\ninterests in the resolution of major international issues,\r\nthere is every reason why developing countries should\r\nbecome permanent members of the Security Council.\r\nWe believe that, despite any need for enlarged\r\nmembership of the Security Council, no permanent\r\nmember seat should be given to any country that has still\r\nfailed to wipe the slate clean with regard to its past as a\r\nnation defeated in the Second World War. Japan is now\r\nseeking permanent membership in the Security Council.\r\nIt must first make a full and unambiguous apology, and\r\nprovide compensation, for its past aggression and war\r\ncrimes. This would be the proper behaviour for Japan.\r\nDisarmament — nuclear disarmament in\r\nparticular — is another task that must be undertaken\r\nurgently. People throughout the Earth have long wanted\r\nto live in a peaceful world free from nuclear weapons,\r\nand they have been calling for the complete abolition of\r\nsuch weapons. However, the nuclear-weapon States are\r\nreluctant to scrap their nuclear arsenals totally, even in\r\nthe current post-cold-war era. They still seek to\r\nperpetuate their monopoly in nuclear weaponry and to\r\njustify legally the continued possession of these weapons.\r\nThis is anachronistic thinking, which only spurs the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nnuclear-arms race and blocks progress in meaningful\r\ndiscussions on general disarmament.\r\nThe extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons is now a matter of worldwide interest\r\nand concern. The existing Treaty defines the rights and\r\nobligations of the nuclear-weapon States and of the\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States respectively on an unequal basis.\r\nIf this Treaty is to be fair it should contain unconditional\r\nnegative security assurances from the nuclear-weapon States\r\nto the non-nuclear-weapon States; a commitment by each\r\nnuclear-weapon State not to be the first to use nuclear\r\nweapons; provision for a total ban on the use of these\r\nweapons; and a timetable for the complete abolition of\r\nnuclear weapons. These would be the first steps towards\r\nrendering meaningless the existence of nuclear weapons on\r\nour planet.\r\nWe are witnessing the disturbance of peace and\r\nsecurity in some regions of the globe. No small number of\r\ncountries are suffering severe calamities. It is indeed\r\nheartbreaking to see how national sovereignty is trampled\r\nunderfoot and how regional conflicts and religious and\r\nethnic conflicts continue unabated, only to escalate into\r\nwars. It is our view that disputes between countries and\r\nnations should be resolved through peaceful negotiations\r\nbetween the parties concerned, in the interests of those\r\nparties and for the sake of world peace.\r\nSocial and economic development is an important\r\nmatter directly related to international peace and security.\r\nIt is common knowledge that social and economic\r\ndevelopment has been greatly hindered, and the worldwide\r\nphenomenon of the rich getting richer and the poor getting\r\npoorer is becoming even more intense. A fair and just\r\ninternational economic order should be established to free\r\nthe people of the developing countries from famine, disease\r\nand disasters and to narrow the widening gap between the\r\ndeveloped and the developing countries.\r\nThe United Nations should give priority to the\r\ndevelopment of the developing countries and strengthen its\r\nown role in their economic and social development. We\r\nhope that the Agenda for Development proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General will make a substantial contribution to\r\nthe economic development of these countries.\r\nThe summits of non-aligned countries and other world\r\nconferences have emphasized the need for the establishment\r\nof a new, fair international order and have adopted\r\nresolutions calling for practical measures to this end. The\r\nnon-aligned and other developing countries are working\r\nhard to achieve South-South cooperation and to establish\r\nthe South-South economic order, starting in the fields of\r\nfood and agriculture, education and health, which are\r\npriority areas in the drive to accelerate social and\r\neconomic development and to shake off economic\r\npoverty.\r\nThe developed countries should pay due attention to\r\nthis matter. They should move to resume dialogue with\r\nthe developing countries and to join in establishing a fair\r\ninternational economic order, and should refrain from any\r\nactions that would hinder the economic development of\r\nthe developing countries.\r\nPeople in many countries are currently engaged in a\r\nvigorous struggle to reject all foreign domination and\r\ninterference, to defend national independence and\r\nsovereignty and to achieve national stability and\r\nprosperity.\r\nWe express our solidarity with the Cambodian\r\npeople, whose cause is the promotion of national\r\nreconciliation and unity and the country’s post-war\r\nrehabilitation. We fully support the peoples of the States\r\nmembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\nin their efforts to secure peace in their respective\r\ncountries and common prosperity, and all other Asian\r\npeoples in their efforts to build a new, independent and\r\nprosperous Asia.\r\nWe support the struggle of the Arab people for a fair\r\nand comprehensive solution of the Palestinian question\r\nand other Middle East problems, and we support Libya’s\r\nefforts to secure a peaceful resolution of the Lockerbie\r\ncrisis through dialogue and negotiations, as well as the\r\nArab League’s proposal in this regard.\r\nWe are gratified by the establishment of the\r\nmultiracial, democratic Government in South Africa\r\nfollowing the eradication of racist rule, and we support\r\nthe African peoples in their struggle to achieve the\r\nindependent development of their respective countries\r\ndespite their socio-economic difficulties.\r\nWe express our firm solidarity with the just cause of\r\nthe Cuban people, who are resolutely defending the\r\nsovereignty of their country and the gains of socialism,\r\nand with the struggle of the Latin American peoples for\r\npeace and prosperity in their countries.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the Korean people will continue\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\ntheir full support for and firm solidarity with all the peoples\r\nin the world in their struggle to oppose all forms of\r\ndomination and subjugation, to build a new society and to\r\npromote the common cause of mankind.\r\nIndependence, peace and friendship have been the\r\nconstant cornerstone of the foreign policy of the\r\nGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nThe concept of independence, peace and friendship as the\r\ncornerstone of our foreign policy, established by our\r\nrespected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung during his lifetime,\r\nreflects the unanimous desire and aspiration of our people\r\nand of peoples throughout the Earth to build a new,\r\nindependent, peaceful and friendly world. It is the principle\r\nby which the Government of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, in its external activities, is constantly\r\nguided.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea will continue to join with the world’s peoples who\r\nare seeking independence, will strengthen the ties of\r\nfriendship and cooperation and will undertake in good faith\r\nits own duties in the interests of the common cause of\r\nmankind - the safeguarding of a just world peace and\r\nsecurity and the building of a new, independent and\r\nprosperous world.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea will work sincerely with other delegations for\r\nsuccess in the discussion of the items on the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ghana, Mr. Obed\r\nAsamoah.\r\nMr. Asamoah (Ghana): On behalf of the Ghana\r\ndelegation, I have the honour and pleasure of conveying to\r\nyou, Sir, our congratulations on your election, by\r\nacclamation, as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session. Your election is an honour not only to\r\nyou personally but also to your country, Côte d’Ivoire, with\r\nwhich Ghana shares a common destiny and, happily, enjoys\r\nvery warm, cordial and special relations. You will no\r\ndoubt be equal to the task, given your disposition and your\r\nrecord of distinguished service to your Government and\r\ncountry and to the international community.\r\nAllow me also to place on record our appreciation of\r\nthe effective leadership that your predecessor as President,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana, provided\r\nfor the Organization during his stewardship. His ability to\r\nnavigate the General Assembly through the difficult\r\ndiscussions on the restructuring and revitalization of the\r\nOrganization — particularly those on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council — and the skill that he demonstrated\r\nduring the world hearings on the proposed Agenda for\r\nDevelopment are indelible marks of his stewardship.\r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nhas continued to remain on top of his very challenging\r\nand delicate task as the chief executive of the\r\nOrganization. His abilities and skills as a thinker,\r\nadministrator and accomplished diplomat have been assets\r\nto the United Nations. The dedication and commitment\r\nof his staff have been equally noteworthy.\r\nIn discharging its primary responsibility to promote\r\ninternational peace and security the United Nations has\r\nhad successes and disappointments. Exploitation of the\r\ninherent weaknesses of the Charter, lack of good faith,\r\ngreed and the quest for domination characterized the era\r\nof the cold war which, happily, appears to be coming to\r\nan end. However, conflicts that threaten international\r\npeace and security exist and are multiplying; some are\r\nlegacies of the cold war and others the result of the\r\nfailure of the international community to create the\r\neconomic and social conditions for international peace\r\nand security. Other contributing factors include inordinate\r\npersonal ambition, ethnicity, nationalism, religious\r\nintolerance and political adventurism.\r\nThanks to the end of the cold war, the political\r\nlandscape in Europe has changed and has impacted\r\npositively, if only with partial success, on Cambodia,\r\nMozambique and, most important of all, the Middle East.\r\nThe Angolan problem appears to be nearing a solution.\r\nAt long last, UNITA is getting the message that the\r\ninternational community abhors its commitment to\r\nmilitarism and appreciates the political maturity and spirit\r\nof compromise of the Angolan Government. Although\r\ncertain cold-war-era conflicts such as Cyprus, Korea and\r\nAfghanistan are proving difficult to solve, one must take\r\ncomfort in the fact that the Koreas are agreed on the basis\r\nof reunification of their country and that, after decades of\r\nconflict and anxiety, South Africa is now a non-racial,\r\ndemocratic country. We take this opportunity to welcome\r\nits delegation into our midst. The contribution of the\r\nUnited Nations in the solution of these conflicts is\r\nimmense, but one must also recognize that no progress\r\nwould have been possible without the exemplary\r\nstatesmanship of the leaders involved in their solution.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nThe end of the cold war, coupled with the strains of\r\nnation-building, have produced new threats to peace in parts\r\nof the former Soviet Union, in Yugoslavia and in Africa.\r\nHorror stories have emerged from Bosnia, Liberia, Rwanda\r\nand Somalia. Some of the problems seem to have no\r\nimmediate prospect of solution. Somalia and Liberia are\r\ncoming close to being written off as Afghanistan has been.\r\nTo an increasing degree regional organizations and small\r\nStates like Ghana are being called upon to bear the burden\r\nof securing a peaceful world, a burden far above their\r\nmeans. In such situations success depends largely upon\r\nsupport from the more endowed members of the\r\ninternational community, either through the United Nations\r\nor on a direct bilateral basis.\r\nIn Liberia, Ghana and a few other countries members\r\nof the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) are groaning under the burden of helping the\r\nLiberians maintain a nation. In Rwanda, in the heat of\r\nbattle Ghana and Canada were left alone to grapple with a\r\nhorror situation without adequate material support. Even\r\nafter the international community was shamed into action,\r\nlogistic support has not been particularly prompt or\r\nadequate.\r\nGhana takes pride in its peace-keeping role. From the\r\nCongo crisis in the early 1960s up until now it has\r\ndemonstrated the will and readiness to come to the help of\r\nnations in distress. We are willing to continue to discharge\r\nour responsibilities if adequate material support can be\r\nforthcoming from the international community, particularly,\r\nits wealthy members. Given the unwillingness of many\r\nnations to get involved in conflicts far from their shores\r\nand in respect of which their national interests are not\r\nmanifest to their electorate, the option for the international\r\ncommunity is to support countries such as Ghana and\r\nregional organizations such as ECOWAS and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to defend the ideals\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nWith President Rawlings’s assumption of the\r\nchairmanship of ECOWAS Ghana is directly face to face\r\nwith the ambitions, rivalries, prejudices, misconceptions and\r\nlack of common purpose even within ECOWAS and with\r\nthe misrepresentations that have made the solution of this\r\nproblem elusive. We must pay a tribute to our predecessors\r\nas Chairmen of ECOWAS who have had to grapple with\r\nthe problem. We have recently gathered the warring\r\nfactions in Akosombo to push the peace process forward.\r\nWe have taken note of the misconceptions and attempts to\r\nundermine this latest effort. However, with persistence,\r\npatience, firmness and transparency, we hope we can make\r\nsignificant progress in the coming year. What we ask of\r\nthe Liberians is sincerity and the spirit of compromise.\r\nFrom the international community, we will appreciate\r\nmoral, material and diplomatic support and an\r\nunderstanding of the complexities of the problem.\r\nPeace-keeping is crowding the international agenda\r\nto such a degree that we seem to be losing our ability to\r\nfocus on the unfinished business of disarmament. The\r\nproliferation of conflicts generates insecurity and\r\ncompounds the disarmament problem. Both problems,\r\nhowever, must be resolved simultaneously. The process\r\nof eliminating nuclear weapons needs to be speeded up to\r\nmake the extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) an attractive proposition for\r\nnon-nuclear Powers. Bilateral efforts at disarmament,\r\nsuch as those under way between the United States of\r\nAmerica and the Russian Federation, need to be situated\r\nin the general context of multilateral diplomacy.\r\nIt is no accident that conflicts abound in the\r\ndeveloping world and the economically backward areas of\r\nEurope. At the root of all these conflict situations and\r\nthe threats to peace and security are economic deprivation\r\nand abject poverty. It is not necessary to restate the\r\ngruesome statistics of the conditions of the poor — the\r\nhigh mortality rates, the malnutrition, the inadequate\r\nhealth facilities, ignorance and poor housing. These\r\nconditions are compounded by a seriously inequitable\r\nsystem of international trade with its attendant problems,\r\nincluding the debt burden. Unequal access to knowledge,\r\ntechnology and resources has accentuated the already\r\nunacceptable socio-economic inequalities both within and\r\namong nations.\r\nThe issue of external debt is primary in its\r\nconstraining effects on economic growth in Africa. The\r\nvast majority of lower-income countries which owe debts\r\ntotalling $1.3 trillion are in sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nSub-saharan Africa alone is overburdened with debt\r\nservicing to the tune of $200 billion representing 10 per\r\ncent of the total national income of the 43 countries\r\ninvolved. It is not sheer coincidence that Africa plays\r\nhost to a sizeable number of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nThe scale of Africa’s debt and the effect it has\r\nproduced in our economies requires action by the\r\ninternational community. The international accord\r\nembodied in the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa, which contains a strategy to\r\nrelaunch African economies on the path of growth and\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nrecovery, has hardly had any noticeable effect a year after\r\nits adoption. The international community is yet to\r\ndischarge its obligations under the international accord. No\r\nagreement has been reached on the modalities for the\r\ncreation of a diversification fund for Africa as called for by\r\nthe various studies initiated by well-known bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations. This is regrettable.\r\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral\r\ntrade negotiations was no doubt a historic achievement. It\r\nholds prospects of opening up possibilities of trade\r\nliberalization and long-term growth. It is, however, equally\r\ntrue — and probably more significant — to note that trade\r\nis possible only after production. A lot of factors constrain\r\nthe ability and capacity of developing countries, particularly\r\nin Africa, to take advantage of international arrangements\r\nsuch as those concluded under the Uruguay Round.\r\nBecause of our conviction that the underlying\r\nsocio-economic factors of the threat to peace and security\r\nshould be seriously addressed by the international\r\ncommunity, the Government of Ghana strongly supports the\r\nholding of the World Summit for Social Development in\r\nCopenhagen, Denmark, from 6-12 March 1995. However,\r\nit should not be an occasion for an attempt to impose a set\r\nof social values on the international community, nor should\r\nit be an opportunity to malign the cultural practices of any\r\ngroup of people. It should be an occasion for mutual\r\nunderstanding to pave the way for a charter for social\r\nprogress.\r\nGhana also attaches great importance to the\r\nforthcoming Fourth World Conference on Women,\r\nscheduled to take place in Beijing in September 1995, as\r\npart of the process of furthering peace and security. We\r\nrecognize the increasingly evident correlation between the\r\nadvancement of women and economic development and\r\nsocial stability. We hope the Conference will help\r\naccelerate the removal of obstacles to women’s full and\r\nequal participation in all spheres of life and enable them to\r\nplay an active role in the global restructuring of economic,\r\npolitical, social and cultural relations as we approach the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe increased responsibilities of the United Nations in\r\npeace-keeping, the expansion of the Organization and the\r\ndemise of the Soviet Union as a super-Power have\r\nhighlighted the need for the Organization’s restructuring.\r\nIn this exercise we must keep two things in mind. We\r\nmust not undermine the validity of the basic principles of\r\nthe Organization, such as the sovereign equality of States\r\nand non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.\r\nNot even the current preoccupation with democracy and\r\nhuman rights should be allowed to erode these principles\r\nany more than is absolutely essential. And we must\r\navoid allowing the Security Council to become the\r\ninstrument for the foreign policy objectives of certain\r\nPowers. We must fight neo-colonialist tendencies\r\nexemplified in the economic blockade of Cuba and the\r\nquestionable imposition of sanctions against the Great\r\nSocialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. There is no\r\nbasis in international law for these actions, which result\r\nin misery for the ordinary people of these countries and\r\nrestrain intercourse between nations. Reasonable proposals\r\nfor an end to these problems have been made which we\r\nhope will find general acceptance.\r\nThe United Nations, particularly the Security\r\nCouncil, needs to be restructured in order to reduce the\r\nvulnerability of small nations to big-Power pressure and\r\nto reflect their increased roles, particularly in the area of\r\npeace-keeping, as well as the realities of power today.\r\nThe increased role of the United Nations in peace-keeping\r\nhas called for the establishment of machinery within the\r\nSecretariat to improve efficiency. In response to the\r\nproposal contained in the Secretary-General’s report, “An\r\nAgenda for Peace”, the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council have adopted a number of measures and\r\ndecisions which should enhance the Organization’s ability\r\nto maintain international peace and security. However, a\r\nlot of work remains to be done. We hope that by its\r\nfiftieth anniversary the United Nations will be sufficiently\r\nreformed and revitalized to command universal respect\r\nand cooperation.\r\nIn the final analysis, however, resources — financial\r\nand otherwise — will determine the effectiveness of the\r\nOrganization. The financial situation of the Organization\r\nremains a source of concern. Members of the\r\nOrganization should redouble their efforts to ensure its\r\nsolvency so that the Secretary-General can effectively\r\nimplement the mandates of the legislative bodies.\r\nThe Members, for their part, expect prudence and\r\ndiscipline in the application of the resources made\r\navailable to the Organization. The consolidation of the\r\ninternal oversight mechanisms into the Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services, together with the existing external\r\noversight mechanisms, should help reduce waste and\r\nensure accountability.\r\nGhana reiterates its belief in the unity of the\r\npurposes of the Charter and wishes to stress the need for\r\nthe Organization to address global development issues\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nwith the same vigour as that with which it has approached\r\nthe issues of global peace and security. It is the hope and\r\nexpectation of Ghana that this forty-ninth session will mark\r\nthe beginning of the renaissance of the United Nations,\r\nready to demonstrate, more in action than in words, its\r\ndetermination to maintain peace and promote prosperity on\r\nthe basis of justice, law and respect for the dignity and\r\nworth of the human person.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for External Relations of Cameroon,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ferdinand Léopold Oyono.\r\nMr. Oyono (Cameroon) (interpretation from French):\r\nOver and above the usual civilities, Sir, the very sincere\r\nand warm congratulations of the Cameroon delegation on\r\nyour election to preside over the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly are addressed to you both as an able\r\ndiplomat and as a worthy representative of Côte d’Ivoire,\r\na country that is a friend of ours and with which we are\r\nhonoured to have longstanding relations of fraternal\r\ncooperation. On behalf of the delegation of Cameroon, I\r\nwish you every success in the exercise of your important\r\nfunctions.\r\nAmbassador Insanally of Guyana, your predecessor,\r\nsuccessfully reflected and expressed our concerns when\r\npresiding over the forty-eighth session. We should like to\r\nexpress our deep appreciation to him.\r\nSince his election our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, has placed all his courage, energy and\r\ndetermination at the service of our Organization to promote\r\npeace, justice and progress in an increasingly difficult\r\nclimate. Cameroon would once again like to assure him of\r\nits firm and constant support.\r\nDespite the uncertainties, upheavals and crises we are\r\nexperiencing in the evolving international environment,\r\nseveral major events since the last session give grounds for\r\nsatisfaction and hope.\r\nThe emergence of a united, democratic and non-racial\r\nSouth Africa, under the leadership of President Nelson\r\nMandela, has sounded the death knell of the apartheid era,\r\nnow a thing of the past, while marking the advent of a new\r\nera on our continent. South Africa can now get down to its\r\neconomic and social development with increased vigour.\r\nCameroon, which was at the forefront of the struggle\r\nagainst the scourge of apartheid, once again solemnly\r\nwelcomes South Africa’s return into the concert of nations.\r\nThe credit for this happy return goes to the United\r\nNations, the Organization of African Unity and the forces\r\nof progress in the world for their combined efforts, but\r\nmainly to the South African people and leaders\r\nthemselves, in particular Nelson Mandela and Frederik de\r\nKlerk, who have always distinguished themselves by the\r\nbreadth of their vision, their courage and their\r\ndetermination.\r\nEchoing the new era beginning in Pretoria, an\r\nimportant stage has just been reached in the long process\r\nleading to the normalization of relations between Israel\r\nand the Palestinians on the one hand, and between Israel\r\nand its other Arab neighbours on the other hand.\r\nThe advent of Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza\r\nStrip and Jericho, pursuant to the agreements concluded,\r\nand the significant progress in the negotiations between\r\nthe Jewish State and Jordan are significant advances\r\ntowards a just and lasting settlement of the question of\r\nthe Middle East, in accordance with the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly. We must encourage this promising, but still\r\nfragile, development and give it all the necessary attention\r\nand determination.\r\nThe judicial settlement of the conflict between Chad\r\nand Libya over the Aouzu Strip, which has finally come\r\ninto being following lengthy negotiations, deserves to be\r\nwelcomed with satisfaction, particularly since it\r\nconstitutes a model for others to follow.\r\nBy bringing the question of the border and territorial\r\ndispute between Nigeria and Cameroon over Bakassi to\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and its\r\nmachinery for the prevention, management and settlement\r\nof conflicts, to the Security Council, which is responsible\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nand to the International Court of Justice, which is charged\r\nwith the peaceful and judicial settlement of conflicts, it\r\nwas the intention of Cameroon to subscribe fully to the\r\nvirtues of preventive diplomacy.\r\nIt is an established fact that, like non-aggression\r\npacts and mutual assistance pacts, preventive diplomacy\r\nis an interesting innovation and one that may well prevent\r\nnew conflicts and suffering, and even reverse the\r\ntendency towards confrontation and war which is so\r\ncharacteristic of our continent.\r\nFor this reason, preventive diplomacy should be\r\nencouraged and supported by the international community.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nFor its part, my country would like to thank all those who\r\nhave supported it in regard to the Bakassi affair. The\r\nmeans of action and the machinery of diplomacy at the\r\ndisposal of the OAU and the United Nations should be\r\nfurther strengthened.\r\nThe positive developments in South Africa and the\r\nMiddle East coincide, unfortunately, with the persistence or\r\nthe eruption of hotbeds of tension throughout the world. In\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, in Cyprus, in Afghanistan, as well\r\nas in Cambodia, peace is still threatened. It is threatened\r\neven further on our continent, a fact to which the tragedy\r\nof Rwanda bears witness.\r\nThis is an opportunity to renew an urgent appeal to\r\nour brothers in Liberia, Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, Angola\r\nand Mozambique, as well as in other countries beset by\r\ntension, conflict and warfare, to rise above their various\r\ndifferences so that they may be able to make the necessary\r\nefforts to meet the challenge of peace.\r\nThe persistence of these conflicts and hotbeds of\r\ntension, so harmful in their consequences, compels us to\r\ninitiate and resolutely and vigorously pursue any action\r\nconducive to peace, security and the building of confidence,\r\nwhich are so necessary in the struggle against poverty and\r\ndestitution.\r\nWithin States we should, for instance, promote\r\ntolerance, respect for the rights of others, participation by\r\nall in the affairs of the country, and fair distribution of the\r\nfruits of growth.\r\nIn relations between States, the independence,\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States must be\r\nrespected, while at the same time this should not be an\r\nobstacle to mutual cooperation in the event of natural\r\ndisasters and calamities that require humanitarian\r\nintervention.\r\nThe creation by the African Heads of State of the\r\nOAU machinery to which I have referred, and the initialling\r\nby the States of central Africa of a non-aggression pact in\r\nSeptember 1994, are among the efforts we have been\r\nmaking to promote good-neighbourly relations based on\r\nconfidence and free from any threat of the use of force.\r\nAlthough at the outset this machinery has already\r\nachieved some excellent results, nevertheless, like the\r\nStanding Consultative Committee on Questions of Security\r\nin Central Africa that was created by the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations in the context of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, it needs the support of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn the final analysis, these regional initiatives to\r\npromote confidence-building measures and progressive\r\ndisarmament should, on the global level, be encouraged\r\nin order to achieve the objectives of the international\r\ncommunity with respect to disarmament, peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThus, we welcome the respect being shown for the\r\nmoratorium on nuclear testing, as well as the progress\r\nachieved in negotiations between the United States and\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea over the\r\nNorth Korean nuclear programme. We encourage both\r\ncountries to find a peaceful solution to that dispute.\r\nRegarding the current negotiations at the Conference\r\non Disarmament to conclude a comprehensive nuclear-\r\ntest-ban treaty, Cameroon joins the Movement of Non-\r\nAligned Countries in expressing the hope that this\r\nconvention will be signed before the Amendment\r\nConference in 1995.\r\nFinally, whether we speak of nuclear weapons or\r\nother weapons of mass destruction, conventional weapons,\r\ntoxic waste, mine clearance or anti-personnel mines,\r\nCameroon also wishes to see the international community\r\nworking towards general and complete disarmament.\r\nIn his report entitled “Agenda for Development”\r\n(A/48/935), the Secretary-General noted very aptly that\r\npeace was the foundation of development; that the\r\neconomy was the engine of progress; that the environment\r\nwas the basis of sustainability; that justice was the pillar\r\nof society, and that democracy represented good\r\ngovernance.\r\nThese preliminary reflections deserve great attention,\r\nsince the “Agenda for Development” is a follow-up to the\r\n“Agenda for Peace” (A/47/277). It reaffirms,\r\nfurthermore, that economic, social and cultural\r\ndevelopment is a fundamental right of the human being.\r\nFurthermore, global talks on development, which\r\nwere held in New York in June 1994 on the initiative and\r\nunder the presidency of Ambassador Insanally, the high-\r\nlevel debate and the recent session of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council on the “Agenda for Development”, the\r\nMinisterial Declaration that followed the commemorative\r\nceremonies for the thirtieth anniversary of the Group of\r\n77 and the substantive session of Economic and Social\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nCouncil indicate that development is a complex\r\nphenomenon, requiring constant effort on the part of States\r\nand of the international community as a whole.\r\nIt is therefore our hope, that on the basis of the\r\npriorities identified during these meetings, the measures\r\nrequired to deal with these issues will be considered by the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the basis of a new report by the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe urgent need to set in motion a new United\r\nNations programme for the development of Africa in the\r\n1990s should be stressed. The timeliness and relevance of\r\nsuch a step was reaffirmed by the international conference\r\non the development of Africa held in Tokyo. The African\r\neconomy, as we know, is essentially based on primary\r\ncommodities. Any strategy for the sustainable development\r\nof the continent must consequently take into account the\r\nneed for diversification. We would like to reiterate the\r\nappeal we made last year from this same rostrum for the\r\ncreation of a fund for diversification of commodities for\r\nAfrica.\r\nIn a different context — and this cannot be repeated\r\ntoo often — debt is a major obstacle to development. The\r\ndebt of developing countries has steadily increased, rising\r\nfrom $1.662 billion in 1992 to $1.770 billion in 1993. We\r\nwelcome the efforts made so far to relieve or reschedule\r\ndebt for developing countries. However, a great deal still\r\nremains to be done, as is emphasized in the 1994 edition of\r\nthe Human Development Report.\r\nDrought and desertification are another subject of\r\nmajor concern. We welcome the fact that negotiations were\r\nsuccessfully concluded last June in Paris to draw up an\r\ninternational convention on drought and desertification, a\r\nmatter of undoubted importance for the world ecosystem\r\nand, more specifically, for the implementation of Agenda\r\n21 in Africa.\r\nIf the conclusion of multilateral economic negotiations\r\nin the context of the Uruguay Round provides further\r\nprospects for a dynamic revitalization of international trade,\r\nit is important that steps be taken in parallel to reverse the\r\npronounced trend towards the marginalization and the\r\nimpoverishment of Africa, which could be promoted by the\r\nnew machinery established at Marrakesh.\r\nHuman rights are universal and indivisible, and we\r\nmust therefore attach equal importance to economic,\r\npolitical, cultural and social rights. Whether in terms of the\r\nrights of women, children, youth, the disabled, the aged or\r\nother vulnerable groups, the human being must remain the\r\ncentral focus of the international community’s concerns.\r\nWe should welcome the Plan of Action adopted at the\r\nrecent International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, held at Cairo, for it takes account of that\r\nrequirement. The Plan of Action does not focus on\r\nmankind as an abstract entity, but on human beings rooted\r\nin their economic, social, cultural and religious diversities,\r\nall of which need to be kept in mind.\r\nThat is why the forthcoming Copenhagen World\r\nSummit on Social Development ought to result in specific\r\ncommitments to reduce poverty, to create productive jobs\r\nand to strengthen social integration, particularly among\r\nthe most vulnerable strata of society.\r\nThe same concerns are reflected in the importance\r\nwe attach to the Fourth World Conference on Women, to\r\nbe held at Beijing in 1995.\r\nIt is in the interest of us all to pursue collective,\r\nunified action to struggle against the harmful effects of\r\ndrugs, the spread of the AIDS pandemic, and natural\r\ncatastrophes, if necessary combining emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance with measures for the\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction of the stricken countries.\r\nIn another area, the entry into force next November\r\nof the Montego Bay convention — the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea — next November is\r\na particularly encouraging development setting the seal on\r\nthe universality of that important legal instrument. We\r\nhope that it will promote exploitation of the seas and\r\noceans for the benefit of all.\r\nAs we near the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, our wish is that the Organization will meet the\r\nchallenge of reform and renewal. Whether it be the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and its subsidiary\r\norgans, the enlargement and strengthening of the Security\r\nCouncil, the rationalization of activities and procedures or\r\nthe consolidation of the Organization’s financial basis,\r\nMember States should strive to mould an institution\r\nworthy of the vision and the inspiration of its founding\r\nfathers.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nnext on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic\r\nof Yemen, His Excellency Mr. Mohammed Salem\r\nBasendwah.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nMr. Basendwah (Yemen) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): At the outset, Sir, please allow me, on behalf of\r\nmy country, my delegation and speaking for myself, to join\r\nprevious speakers in most warmly congratulating you and,\r\nthrough you, your country on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. Your excellent qualifications, extensive\r\nexperience, wisdom and detailed knowledge of international\r\naffairs, give us confidence in that you will guide the\r\ndeliberations at this session to successful conclusions.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity also to express\r\nour gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Samuel Insanally, for the important role he played in\r\nthe forty-eighth session and for his tireless activity\r\nthroughout it. Similarly, fairness compels us to express our\r\nadmiration and great appreciation to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his invaluable and\r\nunremitting efforts since he took up his post, to increase the\r\nimportance of the United Nations, make it more effective\r\nand maximize its ability to carry out its duties properly, and\r\nthereby to increase the confidence of mankind in general,\r\nand every nation in particular, in the credibility of this\r\nOrganization’s commitment to the purposes and principles\r\nof its Charter. Foremost among those is the maintenance\r\nof peace and security on the basis of justice and equality.\r\nIt is our hope that he will continue to play his role with the\r\nsame enthusiasm and high-mindedness.\r\nHaving studied the annual report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, which we have all received, we can say it is\r\ncomprehensive and accurate. The Secretary-General\r\ndeserves our gratitude and appreciation for the outstanding\r\neffort he has put into drawing up that report, and in\r\npresenting it in such a satisfactory form. However, we\r\nshould like to make some remarks on the references made\r\nin the report with regard to Yemen.\r\nAs members are aware, our country, the Republic of\r\nYemen, was earlier this year exposed to bloody sedition as\r\na result of a dangerous conspiracy on the part of a handful\r\nof treacherous mercenary elements who chose to isolate\r\nthemselves from the rest of their fellow countrymen, to\r\nrebel against legitimate institutions, overturn constitutional\r\nlegality and trample on the Constitution, law and order,\r\nwith the aim of destroying the unity of the country, burying\r\nit alive and aborting our experiment in democracy based on\r\npolitical and party pluralism, which was successful despite\r\nthe shortness of the period during which it has been in\r\nplace.\r\nFirst, I should like to point out that history shows\r\nthat throughout the ages our country, Yemen, has always\r\nbeen a single political unit, with the exception of a few\r\nperiods of varying lengths during which it was subjected\r\nto division or segmentation. Sometimes this was the\r\nresult of a power struggle, and sometimes the result of\r\ntotal or partial occupation by one or more foreign powers.\r\nHowever, it was never long before Yemen regained its\r\nunity at the hands of its own people, who never lost sight\r\nof the fact that they are a single Muslim, Arab, Yemeni\r\npeople, and never forgot for one moment that they\r\nbelonged to one nation. Throughout the earlier decades\r\nof this century, wherein our people struggled against the\r\ndictatorial rule of the Imam in the North and British\r\ncolonialism in the South, the unity of Yemen was the\r\nloftiest ideal of our people and its dearest national\r\naspiration. Even after another State was established in\r\nthe South once it became independent of the United\r\nKingdom on 30 November 1967, and after the revolution\r\nof 26 September 1962 in the North, which swept away\r\nthe reactionary rule of the royalist Imam and replaced it\r\nwith a republic, the return to Yemen of unity in the form\r\nof a single State remained an all-embracing, popular and\r\ninsistent demand. Our people never accepted that the\r\nseparation should continue once its national soil had been\r\nliberated from the yoke of occupation. They persisted in\r\nrefusing to accept that abnormal situation and in resisting\r\nit by every means. Each of the two former Yemeni\r\nStates adopted a name which emphasized the fact that it\r\nbelonged to one State called Yemen. Their rejection of\r\npartition led each of those States to refer to the other as\r\nits “other half”.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nAwareness of this strength of feeling among all our\r\npeople in support of the unity of Yemen and of their\r\nrejection of partition made the successive leaders in both\r\nSana’a and Aden spare no effort in vying with each other\r\nand pressuring each other on the question of unity. This\r\nled to two outbreaks of hostilities between the two parts,\r\nthe first in 1972 and the second in 1979 and, throughout,\r\ntension and conflict between them persisted and continued\r\nto flare up from time to time.\r\nHowever, developments since the beginning of\r\n1986 — starting with the tragic civil strife between the\r\npartners in power in the South and the comrades of the\r\nSocialist Party, the sole ruling party, followed by the\r\npolicy changes in the Soviet Union culminating in the fall\r\nof regimes in the countries of what used to be called the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nsocialist, or Eastern, bloc and, finally, the end of the cold\r\nwar — all this created the right conditions for re-uniting\r\nYemen.\r\nAnother factor was that the regime in the South, which\r\nhad been tightly linked to the Soviet Union and its socialist-\r\ncountry allies, found itself unable to oppose internal and\r\nexternal enemies without strong international backing. It\r\nwas therefore possible to agree to unite the two halves of\r\nthe country on 30 November 1989, during President\r\nLieutenant-General Ali Abdullah Saleh’s visit to Aden on\r\nthe twenty-second anniversary of the South’s independence,\r\nand to persuade the then ruling Socialist Party leadership to\r\naccept unification.\r\nOn 22 May 1990 unity was peacefully and voluntarily\r\nestablished in the form of a single State called the Republic\r\nof Yemen, a Republic based on democracy and pluralism.\r\nThe first general parliamentary elections were scheduled to\r\ntake place at the end of a period of transition of two and a\r\nhalf years, during which time Yemen was to be governed\r\njointly by elements drawn from the leadership of each of\r\nthe previous two “halves” of the country. However, as\r\ntime passed and the agreed date for the scheduled\r\nparliamentary elections drew near, some high Government\r\nofficials from the leadership of the Socialist Party — the\r\nother governing partner at that time — began to create\r\nproblems and crises in order to prevent the holding of\r\nelections on the agreed date. As a result, the elections were\r\npostponed from November 1992 to 27 April 1993.\r\nThe elections, when they finally took place, were\r\nindeed free and fair, as was attested to by all those who\r\ntook part in monitoring them. Those monitors included\r\nrepresentatives of States, organizations and institutes\r\nconcerned with democracy and the protection of human\r\nrights and freedoms, side by side with journalists and\r\ncorrespondents from Arab and non-Arab news agencies. In\r\nan editorial published at the time of the elections, The New\r\nYork Times described them as\r\n“a true revolution in the furthest part of the Southern\r\nArabian peninsula”.\r\nDespite the fact that the results of the election gave\r\nthe General People’s Congress, under the leadership of His\r\nExcellency President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Chairman of the\r\nPresidential Council at that time, the sole right to form a\r\nGovernment, the President and his party favoured a\r\ncoalition with the other two important parties: the Islah\r\nparty, the Yemeni Alliance for Reform (YAR) and the\r\nYemeni Socialist Party. This was inspired by a genuine\r\ndesire to strengthen the bonds of national consensus, to\r\nguarantee secure foundations and support for the\r\nsuccessful establishment of national unity, particularly in\r\nits early stages, and to guarantee continuity and survival\r\nfor a democratic experiment which was still in its cradle.\r\nThey also aimed at preventing conspirators and\r\nopportunists from having any leeway to exacerbate\r\ndisagreements or provoke armed conflict.\r\nOnly a few weeks after the formation of the\r\ncoalition Government, on 31 May of that year, while the\r\nfreely and directly elected Parliament was preparing to\r\ncarry out its work and discharge its duties, there began to\r\nappear certain indications that a suspect plot was being\r\nhatched. It was clear that elements of the leadership of\r\nthe partner in the governing coalition, the Socialist Party,\r\nwho held important positions in the constitutional\r\ninstitutions and, more precisely, in the Presidential\r\nCouncil and the Cabinet of Ministers, were behind the\r\nplan. The prevailing belief was that the matter was\r\nnothing more than an attempt to exert pressure in order to\r\nextract more concessions and a bargaining chip they used\r\nto obtain more government posts or, in the very least, to\r\nmaintain positions in the Presidential Council when it was\r\nre-elected, if that was decided. Again, it could have been\r\nan attempt to secure the post of Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic if the form of the Presidency of the State was\r\ngoing to be changed from a Presidential Council to a\r\nrepublican presidency. Naturally, the results of the\r\ngeneral elections did not suit the ruling elements of the\r\nSocialist Party, despite their sharing in power and the\r\nimportant leading positions they held. That was perhaps\r\ndue to their addiction to being the sole ruling centralized\r\ntotalitarian authority, their love of ruling without partners\r\nand the fact that they lacked belief in the country’s unity,\r\nand had no deep-rooted confidence in democracy, political\r\npluralism or in free direct elections.\r\nSuddenly, without any reason or justification, in\r\naccordance with a carefully planned time-table, those\r\nelements created a political crisis, and matters reached the\r\npoint where an attempt was made to ruin or at least to\r\nparalyse the institutions and apparatus of the State and to\r\nusurp the constitutional legality derived from the will of\r\nthe people through the ballot box and replace it with a\r\nlegality derived from decisions taken as result of dialogue\r\nbetween different parties. Those conspiring elements\r\nwere not satisfied with that, despite the grave risks\r\ninvolved. Rather, their arrogance and disregard of\r\nlegality were carried to the point of wanting to impose\r\ntheir tutelage over the people and to impose an\r\nundeclared partition through the continual use of an\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\niron-fist policy and absolute control over a number of\r\nGovernorates, which they used to rule by force and\r\noppression in the days before unification.\r\nDespite all the generous concessions that continued to\r\nbe made from time to time by the leadership of the\r\nmajority, under the direction of His Excellency President\r\nAli Abdullah Saleh, who was at that time Chairman of the\r\nPresidential Council, the elements bent on separatism\r\nstepped up their challenge and their disregard of\r\nconstitutional legality to the point of triggering hostilities in\r\nthe hope of bringing Arab or international forces to separate\r\nthe combatants and force each side to withdraw beyond the\r\nold borders dividing the two halves. Their aim was to put\r\nan end to unification, to declare another separate State on\r\npart of the territory of the homeland, and thereby to revert\r\nto the situation that existed before 22 May 1990.\r\nHowever, our people stood behind our armed forces\r\nand security forces, whose loyalty set them squarely on the\r\nside of legality. Those forces were able to turn the fighting\r\ndecisively in favour of unity and democracy, and by so\r\ndoing were able to abort the suspect plot and to maintain\r\nYemen as the unified single State it has been throughout its\r\nlong history.\r\nToday, Yemen has regained its stability and ensured\r\nits security, after that ordeal, and has put an end to sedition.\r\nA general amnesty has been declared, and national\r\nreconciliation has been achieved. Those who fell prey to\r\ndeceit and disinformation have returned to the nation to\r\nparticipate in political life, and they benefit from the spirit\r\nof tolerance which characterizes the political leadership of\r\nPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh. Here I should like to\r\nemphasize to you and to the Secretary-General that no harm\r\nhas befallen any of those people and that none of them has\r\nbeen put on trial. Most of them have gone back to their\r\nnormal lives quite naturally. That was not all: the Socialist\r\nParty itself spontaneously elected a new leadership which\r\ncontained many elements of the former leadership, and\r\nwent back to participating in political activity in complete\r\nfreedom. Its representatives in parliament participate in\r\nparliamentary life just as they did before.\r\nWithin the framework of the leadership’s attempts to\r\nensure the success and continued progress of our\r\ndemocratic experiment, and in order to expand the basis of\r\npopular power sharing, the elected parliament, on 27\r\nSeptember 1994, unanimously passed a number of\r\nconstitutional amendments which provide for the\r\nintroduction of a local governmental system based on the\r\nprinciple of free and fair elections. They also decided to\r\ncreate a consultative council to be established by\r\nrepublican decree from experienced and highly qualified\r\npersonalities from various regions of Yemen to widen and\r\nexpand the basis of representation and opinion.\r\nLast Saturday, 1 October 1994, the Chamber of\r\nDeputies — again in complete freedom — elected\r\nLieutenant General Ali Abdullah Saleh President of the\r\nRepublic in accordance with the amendment approved by\r\nthe Parliament regarding the organization of the national\r\npresidency, which was amongst those constitutional\r\namendments.\r\nOur choice of the democratic option based on\r\npolitical and party pluralism was not the result of pressure\r\nfrom any side, rather it was motivated by our conviction\r\nthat democracy is the best contemporary method of\r\ngovernment. It represents the path leading to\r\ndevelopment, progress, security and stability. However,\r\nthe continued success of our democratic experiment\r\nremains subject to economic growth. That requires an\r\nend to the economic war that continues to be waged\r\nagainst our country. This is a war which takes many\r\ndifferent forms, including the closing of markets in other\r\ncountries of the region to our agricultural and industrial\r\nproducts. We therefore appeal to all our brethren in\r\nneighboring countries to lift all the barriers and remove\r\nall the obstacles to free trade and the movement of locally\r\nproduced goods as an important step towards the\r\nnormalization of relations, and the strengthening of\r\nbrotherly ties and regional cooperation.\r\nAs an extension of the national reconciliation\r\nprocess which we have begun to implement within\r\nYemen, despite all the events which have taken place,\r\nhand in hand with that and in the same spirit, we call\r\nupon all neighboring countries to respond positively to\r\nour sincere initiative, to end the causes of dispute and\r\nresume normal relations, which will strengthen security\r\nand stability in the Arabian Peninsula region, based on\r\ngood-neighborliness, mutual respect and non-interference\r\nin internal affairs. The Republic of Yemen has an\r\nimportant geographical and strategic position, as\r\nrepresented by its control over Bab al-Mandab, and the\r\nRed Sea and the Arabian Sea, which meet in its territorial\r\nwaters in the Gulf of Aden. The Republic of Yemen is\r\naware of its responsibilities and of the importance of the\r\nrole it plays in the maintenance of security and stability\r\nin the Arabian Peninsula region, of the Gulf in particular,\r\nand the world in general.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nIn this context, we would like to appeal to the Security\r\nCouncil to lift the sanctions which are still in place against\r\nIraq after such a long time, as the justifications for such\r\nsanctions no longer exist. The suffering of the Iraqi people\r\nhas reached intolerable levels. Insistence on maintaining\r\nsuch measures will lead to deepening enmity and hatred\r\nbetween the States of the region. It is necessary to turn a\r\nnew leaf and have recourse to dialogue in order to ensure\r\nthe security and safety of all sides concerned, in a spirit of\r\nlove and fraternity, and on the basis of respect for the\r\nindependence and sovereignty and legal rights of every\r\nparty.\r\nOn the basis of our membership in a wider nation, we\r\nfeel impelled to appeal to the Security Council to review its\r\nresolutions against Libya, our sister country, and accept the\r\nreasonable solutions put forward by the Arab League,\r\nwhich include the trial of the Lockerbie suspects before an\r\ninternational court, in accordance with the law of Scotland.\r\nWith regard to the three islands disputed by the United\r\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran, we would\r\nlike to ask both countries to work towards resolving this\r\ndispute between them through dialogue and mutual\r\nunderstanding based on respect for legitimate rights in\r\naccordance with legal evidence.\r\nIt is very important indeed that cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the League of\r\nArab States should be strengthened, in the interests of the\r\nArab world in particular, and of the rest of the world in\r\ngeneral.\r\nThe Middle East peace process has so far achieved an\r\nagreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\nand Israel on the one hand, and Jordan and Israel on the\r\nother. However, a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in\r\nthe region remains linked to the withdrawal of Israeli forces\r\nfrom the Golan Heights and South Lebanon, the\r\nrenunciation of the logic of power by the Tel Aviv\r\ngovernment, and its acceptance of an independent\r\nPalestinian State in Gaza and the West Bank, including\r\nHoly Al Quds.\r\nWe cannot forget our beloved brotherly Sudan. We\r\nunderscore the need to respect and safeguard its unity and\r\ncall for commitment to help it maintain that unity both on\r\nthe territorial and the human levels.\r\nThe fact that our sister country Somalia remains in the\r\ngrip of fragmentation, anarchy and fighting, is deeply\r\ndistressing to us and makes our hearts bleed. We will do\r\nall we can to help our neighbour and its fraternal, Arab,\r\nMuslim people to emerge from its terrible trial, by\r\nparticipating with other fraternal countries in the\r\nCommittee which it was decided to form by the last\r\nsession of the Arab Foreign Ministers which was held in\r\nCairo. We hope this Committee will receive the\r\ncooperation of the United Nations.\r\nIt is also a cause of deep sorrow that the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina remains a target of terrible\r\naggression and continuous shelling by the Serb\r\naggressors, while the world does nothing but make\r\nstatements and threaten to take measures which have yet\r\nto materialize. Perhaps the least that could be done as a\r\nfirst step towards showing some determination in the face\r\nof Serb persistent disregard for peace and security in that\r\nimportant region, their trampling of the resolutions of\r\ninternational legality, would be to immediately lift the\r\narms embargo and to begin to supply arms to the people\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, to enable them to defend\r\nthemselves against aggression.\r\nWe have become ever more convinced that right will\r\ntriumph over injustice, the same as the people of South\r\nAfrica have done by eliminating apartheid and racial\r\ndiscrimination following such a long arduous struggle.\r\nWe would like to express our happiness at seeing this\r\nnew African State among us. We should also like to\r\nexpress to the pioneer of freedom fighters, President\r\nNelson Mandela, our appreciation and respect. May we\r\nwish him all success and progress in leading his country,\r\nparticularly after leading his people a phase of struggle\r\nwith courage, resistance and steadfastness.\r\nIt is important to mention here before concluding my\r\nstatement, that the accusations against Islam and judging\r\nIslam from the point of view of certain acts of terrorism\r\ntaking place here or there because there are others who\r\nare not Muslims who perpetuate acts of terrorism in\r\nvarious parts of the world without having any accusations\r\nlevelled against their religions or their creeds. We\r\ntherefore believe that we should all stand against any\r\nattempt to distort the concept and image of Islam and\r\nagainst any allegations against it because Islam is a\r\nreligion which rejects violence and terrorism, a religion\r\nthat calls for love, coexistence and peace.\r\nIn order to show its respect and appreciation for the\r\nUnited Nations, the Republic of Yemen has formed a\r\nnational committee to organize celebrations for the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of this international\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nOrganization. We want our celebrations on this occasion\r\nto reflect the importance we attach to it.\r\nWe should not miss the opportunity to refer also to the\r\nimportance of working to enlarge the representative base of\r\nthe Security Council, so as to take into consideration the\r\ninternational changes that have taken place since the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations. One of the most\r\nimportant of these is the emergence of two major economic\r\npowers - Japan and Germany. They should join the\r\nSecurity Council as permanent members. There should also\r\nbe just, permanent representation of regional groupings,\r\nincluding the Arab region.\r\nFinally, we hope that the fiftieth anniversary of this\r\nOrganization will be an incentive for renewing the vitality\r\nand effectiveness of the United Nations, and an\r\nintensification of its role, in order to achieve the aims of\r\nthe Charter in the light of the needs and requirements of the\r\nnew international changes.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Sierra\r\nLeone, His Excellency Mr. Abass Chernor Bundu.\r\nMr. Bundu (Sierra Leone): It is with great pleasure\r\nthat I congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his election to the\r\npresidency of the current session of the General Assembly.\r\nHis remarkable talent and consummate experience assure us\r\nthat we can feel proud and confident as he discharges his\r\nnew functions admirably and with distinction. His\r\nleadership of the Assembly confers dignity on Africa, on\r\nWest Africa and on his country, Côte d’Ivoire, with which\r\nSierra Leone happily enjoys excellent bilateral relations and\r\nshares a common West African identity. We extend to him\r\nan abiding wish for his success.\r\nTo Ambassador Insanally of Guyana, his immediate\r\npredecessor, I convey my delegation’s gratitude and\r\nappreciation for the commendable manner in which he\r\nperformed his duties as President of the forty-eighth session\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nThe approach adopted by the Secretary-General of our\r\nOrganization since he assumed office has been exemplary\r\nin many ways. He deserves high tribute for his untiring\r\nefforts over the past two years, especially in the realms of\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and the\r\npromotion of development.\r\nThe world is still in transition. Although the outcome\r\nof the process of transformation is not easy to predict with\r\nany degree of certainty, it is nevertheless clear that the\r\nworld will continue to be preoccupied in the next half-\r\ncentury with problems carried over from the last -\r\nproblems concerning the promotion of development,\r\nespecially of the least developed countries; the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security; and the consolidation\r\nand strengthening of the process of cooperation and\r\nintegration between nations. These are among the major\r\nchallenges of our time.\r\nDevelopmental and political issues now occupy a\r\nlarger part of our global, regional and national agendas,\r\nand the past 12 months have been no exception. In some\r\ncases, these developments have been a source of joy and\r\nsatisfaction; in others, the stigma of shame and disgrace\r\nhas loomed larger.\r\nOn the economic front, the slow, uncertain and\r\nunbalanced growth of the economies of developing\r\ncountries generally has been a source of grave concern.\r\nThis is evidenced by the alarming increase in the number\r\nof peoples living in absolute poverty, stagnating resource\r\nflows, dwindling direct foreign investment, reduction in\r\nexport earnings, excruciating debt crises, rising\r\nunemployment, especially among the youth, and\r\nenvironmental degradation.\r\nThe persistence of these problems could easily\r\nundermine the stability of the world economy and pose\r\nserious threats to international peace and security.\r\nImmeasurable work has been done to redress the\r\neconomic stranglehold in which most of our countries\r\nfind themselves. A lot more, however, needs to be done\r\nby the developed countries and the international financial\r\ninstitutions to prevent many of the world’s poor countries\r\nfrom being completely submerged by the heavy burdens\r\nimposed by the present international economic system.\r\nMore specifically, new, additional resources, at both the\r\nmultilateral and the bilateral levels, need to be provided\r\nby our development partners if any improvement in the\r\nlives of the teeming millions in the third world is to be\r\nassured.\r\nThe situation is even more acute for my country,\r\nwhich is in the throes of a rebel war and implementing a\r\nsubstantial economic reform programme as well as a\r\npolitical transition programme — all three activities\r\ntaking place simultaneously. Hardly any other State\r\nmember of the Assembly shares this unique experience.\r\nGiven the increasing interdependence and globalization of\r\nthe world economy, the massively deteriorating economic\r\nsituation of the developing countries and, in particular, the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nuniqueness of the plight of Sierra Leone deserve the full\r\nand urgent attention of all the members of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nPoverty and the decreasing living standards of the\r\nmajority of our people are at the heart of our problems. To\r\nalleviate these problems, my Government has embarked on\r\ncourageous, wide-ranging and far-reaching socio-economic\r\nreforms, including the deregulation of prices and exchange\r\nand interest rates, and the reduction of fiscal deficit. The\r\npace and scope of these reforms, however, contrast sharply\r\nwith the very modest results achieved so far. Despite\r\nconsiderable success in securing short-term macroeconomic\r\nstabilization, the reforms appear to have neither removed\r\nthe structural constraints facing the economy nor improved\r\nsupply capacity. We are now resolved to ensure that future\r\nadjustment programmes are designed and implemented in\r\na manner that takes due cognizance of the special needs of\r\nthe vulnerable groups of our society as well as the social\r\nrequirements of development.\r\nThose are just some of the difficult tasks ahead. They\r\nare made no less formidable by the new challenges posed\r\nby the Uruguay Round agreements signed at Marrakesh last\r\nApril. My Government welcomes the new agreements, but\r\nwould stress the need for continued evaluation of their\r\nimplementation to ensure expansion of world trade for all\r\ncountries, improved market access and adequate protection\r\nof the interests of the least developed countries in\r\nparticular. Any attempt, therefore, to impose new\r\nconditionalities, encompassing environmental and labour\r\nconditionalities in this context, must be strongly resisted.\r\nIn the meantime, the observation is inescapable that\r\nthe Marrakesh agreements pose a real danger to trade\r\npreferences previously assured developing countries; this\r\ncan lead to a loss in export market share and export\r\nearnings. Moreover, countries that are net importers of\r\nfood face the prospect of higher food-import bills arising\r\nfrom the liberalization of trade in the agricultural sector.\r\nThere is therefore a need to address without delay the\r\nquestion of how the adverse consequences of the Marrakesh\r\nagreements can be mitigated through enhanced trade\r\npreferences, assistance and compensation.\r\nThe external indebtedness of developing countries\r\nposes the biggest impediment to their development. A\r\npermanent and comprehensive solution must therefore be\r\nfound without further delay. That is why we commend the\r\nChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, His Excellency\r\nPresident Soeharto of Indonesia, for taking the initiative to\r\nconvene in Jakarta last August a ministerial meeting of\r\nnon-aligned countries on debt and development, with the\r\ntheme “sharing of experiences”. That high-level meeting\r\non the debt crisis of developing countries, which I\r\nattended together with Ministers from twenty-five heavily\r\ndebt-distressed, least-developed countries, endorsed a\r\nnumber of general principles for debt reduction, which\r\nrepresent a significant step in the search for a lasting\r\nsolution to the debt problem. We therefore urge the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community to adopt\r\nthe principles contained in the report of the Jakarta\r\nmeeting, submitted to the Assembly by Indonesia.\r\nCalling upon the international community to pay\r\nspecial attention to the problems of developing countries\r\nis not a proclamation of abdication of responsibility. In\r\nAfrica, for example, we have accepted that the key to\r\nsustainable development is in the hands of Africans\r\nthemselves. The African leadership must therefore\r\ndemonstrate a determination to stay the course of\r\nappropriate economic reforms and improvement in\r\ngovernance. We do emphasize, however, that the\r\ninternational community must play a crucial supportive\r\nrole in the creation of the environment necessary to\r\nguarantee sustainable growth and development of\r\ndeveloping countries in ways that include the provision of\r\nadequate levels of concessional, financial and technical\r\nsupport for infrastructure and national capacity-building\r\non a continuous, predictable and assured basis.\r\nThe issues I have raised will no doubt be on the\r\nagendas of certain conferences slated for the coming year.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development in\r\nCopenhagen, March 1995, will provide an opportunity for\r\nall of us to focus on such matters as socio-economic\r\ndevelopmental challenges, the adoption of a global\r\nstrategy for poverty eradication, the generation of\r\nproductive employment and the enhancement of social\r\nintegration — in all of which the needs of people will\r\noccupy centre stage. The situation of women and the\r\nneed to integrate them better in the development process\r\nas agents and beneficiaries of development will also\r\nreceive attention at the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, to be convened at Beijing in September next\r\nyear. This Assembly, for its part, is convening a\r\nhigh-level intergovernmental meeting to conduct a\r\nmid-term global review of progress in the implementation\r\nof the Programme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries in the 1990s. Naturally, my delegation holds\r\nhigh expectations that the recommendations and\r\nconclusions of these meetings will make substantial\r\ncontributions towards creating the climate necessary for\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nenhancing the socio-economic conditions of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nIn the same vein, my delegation commends the timely\r\ninitiative of the Secretary-General in submitting “An\r\nAgenda for Development” pursuant to the resolutions of\r\nthis Assembly. It provides us with another historic\r\nopportunity to address the root causes of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment of the developing countries in a holistic\r\nand comprehensive manner. We urge the Secretary\r\n-General to make concrete, action-oriented\r\nrecommendations for the enhancement of the\r\nsocio-economic conditions of these countries and to suggest\r\npractical measures for their implementation.\r\nTurning now to the environment, my delegation is\r\nconcerned at the general response to the recommendations,\r\ndecisions and commitments of the Rio de Janeiro\r\nConference on Environment and Development, held over\r\ntwo years ago. True, some progress has been recorded\r\nsince that Conference. What is missing, however, is a clear\r\ncommitment on the part of the developed countries to\r\nprovide financial and other relevant resources for the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. We in the developing world\r\nare committed to implementing Agenda 21, but this\r\ncommitment will remain illusory unless it is complemented\r\nby adequate human, financial and technical resources.\r\nOn the world political scene too, the picture that we\r\nsee concurrently inspires hope and engenders desperation.\r\nWithout a doubt, the holding of the first pluralistic,\r\nnon-racial, democratic elections in South Africa, in April\r\nthis year, and the subsequent installation of a Government\r\nof national unity, marked a major achievement not only for\r\nthe people of South Africa but also for this Organization.\r\nThe patient and dedicated struggle of all peace-loving South\r\nAfricans to resolve peacefully the abominable policy of\r\napartheid, aided by the committed solidarity of the world at\r\nlarge, has been amply rewarded.\r\nIn taking this opportunity, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Sierra Leone, formally to\r\nwelcome South Africa back into this world Assembly, I\r\nwish to reiterate our commitment to work together with the\r\nnew Government to make our continent a better place for\r\nall of us. Theirs has been a long and arduous journey\r\nthrough dark and difficult times that tested both courage\r\nand faith. The presence of the South African delegation\r\nhere today is a confirmation of man’s ability to rise above\r\nthose conditions that threaten his survival and to resolve\r\nthem peacefully, though they may have originally appeared\r\ninsurmountable.\r\nThere are at least three lessons to be learnt from the\r\nSouth African experience:\r\nFirst, with South Africa’s freedom, the non-white\r\npeoples of that country, and indeed everywhere, are\r\nenabled to regain their lost humanity. While apartheid\r\nexisted, its stigma touched many, even beyond that\r\ncountry’s borders. Yet, with that policy’s banishment\r\nfrom the South African landscape, this Organization\r\nshould now rekindle its sense of purpose to continue the\r\nstruggle against racial discrimination and segregation\r\nwherever they exist.\r\nSecondly, the attainment by South Africa of\r\ndemocratic values under a non-racial Government of\r\nnational unity should demonstrate to all countries,\r\nespecially in Africa, that excuses for denying a similar\r\ntransformation to our own societies are now untenable.\r\nThirdly, the fact that such a man as Mr. Nelson\r\nMandela could emerge from 27 years of imprisonment on\r\nRobben Island and, setting aside any bitterness, preach\r\nand demonstrate accommodation and national\r\nreconciliation should in itself encourage our brothers and\r\nsisters in divided societies to forswear retribution and\r\nstrive instead for tolerance and harmony.\r\nThese lessons have not been lost on us in Sierra\r\nLeone. We have come to understand and appreciate from\r\nthis exemplary South African political experience that,\r\nwhere democratic principles are applied in full in the\r\ngovernance of any nation, there is every likelihood that\r\nsolutions will be found to the political problems of that\r\nnation, however intractable they may appear. Conscious\r\nof this fact, the Government of the National Provisional\r\nRuling Council of Sierra Leone, headed by His\r\nExcellency Captain Valentine Strasser, has unveiled a\r\npolitical reform programme that will ensure the\r\ninstallation of a democratically elected government in our\r\ncountry by January 1996.\r\nWith that in view, an Interim National Electoral\r\nCommission of eminent citizens has now been constituted,\r\nheaded by Mr. James Jonah, former Under-\r\nSecretary-General of this Organization. Furthermore, as\r\na result of extensive debates on an initial Working\r\nDocument put together by a National Advisory Council,\r\nthe draft constitution has now been finalized and will\r\nsoon be presented to the people for final approval.\r\nMeanwhile, a National Commission on Democracy, which\r\nwill undertake a programme of mass education to let the\r\npeople appreciate the values of democracy and their rights\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nand duties as citizens, will soon be appointed. All these\r\nsteps are designed to underscore the commitment of my\r\nGovernment towards the full restoration of democracy in\r\nSierra Leone by the end of 1995. Let me assure this\r\nAssembly that the Government of the National Provisional\r\nRuling Council remains fully committed to the transition\r\nprogramme, which continues to be on course. We look\r\nforward to the cooperation and assistance of the\r\ninternational community in enabling us to realize the\r\nprogramme’s objectives.\r\nAllow me at this point to recall the adoption by the\r\nGeneral Assembly last year of resolution 48/196, entitled\r\n“International assistance to Sierra Leone”, and our\r\ncontinued expectation for the full implementation of its\r\nprovisions. We are appreciative of the assistance extended\r\nto Sierra Leone so far by the international community,\r\nespecially in the humanitarian field, and look forward to its\r\ncontinuation and increase in the future.\r\nYet, as promising as the nation’s prospects are, it\r\nshould not be forgotten that we are engaged in a rebel war\r\nwhose origins are inextricably linked to the Liberian\r\nconflict, and whose consequences are still visible in the\r\nlarge number of refugees and internally displaced Sierra\r\nLeoneans, who now total an estimated 300,000 and 400,000\r\nrespectively. Further, the untold devastation of the\r\ncountry’s economically productive areas continues to\r\nundermine an already fragile economy.\r\nMy Government realizes that even though our meagre\r\nresources are now committed to bringing this rebel war to\r\nan end, we must necessarily look forward to the\r\nreconstruction of our country and its economy, a task\r\nwhose success will be greatly enhanced through\r\ncollaboration with the United Nations system, especially in\r\nworking out a programme for the rehabilitation of the\r\ndevastated areas and the resettlement of our refugees and\r\ndisplaced citizens. To this end, we have already laid the\r\nfoundations for the expeditious rehabilitation of these areas\r\nupon the conclusion of the war, by setting up a National\r\nRehabilitation Committee that will oversee our efforts in\r\nthis matter.\r\nWhile, as a Government, we continue with reluctance\r\nto pursue the military option in prosecuting this war — and\r\nwe wish to record here our appreciation to all friendly\r\nGovernments, particularly Nigeria, Guinea and the People’s\r\nRepublic of China, for their assistance in that effort — let\r\nme say here and now that no option is foreclosed. We\r\nremain amenable to any option, military or non-military,\r\nthat will secure a speedy conclusion to this untenable\r\nsituation, thus ensuring the creation of an environment\r\nconducive to the holding of the elections anticipated in\r\nour transition programme.\r\nThe success of these undertakings and of others in\r\nmy Government’s transition programme depends largely\r\non the progress that is made in restoring peace to Liberia,\r\nhence our deep concern about developments taking place\r\nacross our border. It is in this connection that we renew\r\nour commitment to the Cotonou accords and reiterate that\r\nthey contain the essential elements for the resolution of\r\nthe Liberian conflict, namely the disarmament of the\r\nwarring factions, leading to the holding of elections.\r\nDrawing from the experience in Angola, it is clear that\r\nwithout such disarmament, peace in Liberia will be\r\ntenuous at best. We therefore call on the United Nations\r\nand the international community to support the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nfinancially, logistically and otherwise in order to\r\nreinvigorate the peace process and ensure that\r\ndisarmament gains renewed momentum.\r\nGiven our own refugee situation, we are gravely\r\nconcerned about the increasing flows in the world refugee\r\npopulation, about half of whom are children, whose needs\r\nshould be met through appropriate measures of protection\r\nand assistance. This International Year of the Family\r\ntherefore provides an excellent opportunity to focus\r\nattention on the essential needs of refugee children. In\r\ncontemplating concrete measures to be taken by the\r\ninternational community in addressing this phenomenon,\r\nit is essential that the United Nations Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child be fully implemented.\r\nAs crucial as these measures are for mitigating the\r\nglobal refugee problem, we remain convinced that, unless\r\nand until the international community overcomes the\r\nscourge of poverty and political strife, this problem will\r\nremain constantly with us. It is our fervent hope,\r\ntherefore, that a renewed impetus will once again be\r\nfound to prevent and eradicate this condition of boundless\r\nhuman misery.\r\nLooking beyond the borders of our region, Sierra\r\nLeone acknowledges the signing of the Washington\r\nDeclaration by Israel and Jordan, ending the state of war\r\nbetween the two countries. We see this as a continuation\r\nof the peace process that started three years ago and that\r\nled to the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-\r\nGovernment Arrangements in the West Bank and the\r\nGaza Strip. It is a positive development, coming after the\r\nassumption of Palestinian self-government earlier this\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nyear, and anticipates the eventual attainment of\r\ncomprehensive peace among all concerned parties in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nIn this connection, my Government would like to\r\ncommend the role of the United States and Egypt for their\r\nrelentless efforts in bringing together Israel and its Arab\r\nneighbours. We urge Israel on the one hand, and Lebanon\r\nand Syria on the other to intensify their efforts and display\r\nthe spirit of accommodation that had underpinned successes\r\nin other areas, so as to make the important objective of a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East\r\nrealizable within the shortest possible time — in the interest\r\nnot only of the people of the region, but of the world at\r\nlarge.\r\nWith regard to the dispute between Kuwait and Iraq,\r\nwe call upon Iraq fully to respect the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of Kuwait in accordance with the terms\r\nof the resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nWe would also hope that in other areas, such as\r\nSomalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, there will be\r\nprogress in bringing to an end the present unacceptable\r\nstalemate. While the absence of progress may be\r\nfrustrating, we nevertheless believe that it would be a tragic\r\nmistake even to contemplate disengagement from peace-\r\nkeeping operations in Africa at this crucial stage.\r\nBy far the most appalling situation that the\r\ninternational community has had to confront recently is that\r\nin Rwanda. We will not readily forget those graphic\r\nimages of death, abject misery and destruction, or soon\r\novercome the torment and challenges that our collective\r\nconscience has had to face. It is hard to explain and harder\r\nstill to understand how those dark days from April to July\r\ncould have taken place in this century in full view of the\r\nworld. That such a tragedy occurred at all points to the\r\nfailure of existing international mechanisms for responding\r\nto such devastating situations.\r\nDrawing from the Rwandan experience, the time has\r\ncome for all of us, but more so for us in Africa, to come to\r\nterms with the diverse nature of our societies and realize\r\nthat the denial by any group of the right of another group\r\nor section to participate in the life of a nation is\r\nindefensible and ultimately self-destructive. Peaceful\r\ncoexistence of heterogeneous communities and power-\r\nsharing within a nation are great values we must all uphold.\r\nFurther, we believe that painful admissions must be\r\nmade. A few years ago, when the Monitoring Group of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOMOG) was deployed in Liberia, much criticism was\r\nlevelled against it. We were accused of harbouring\r\nulterior motives against that country and of encouraging\r\nintervention. Yet, looking back, none will deny today\r\nthat by its deployment ECOMOG averted a similar\r\ntragedy in Liberia. Concerted action by West Africans\r\nbrought that country back from the brink. Today,\r\nECOMOG represents Africa’s flagship in preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peace-keeping, peace-building and peace\r\nenforcement. We call on States in Rwanda’s region to\r\nreassert their lead role in the search for a peaceful\r\nsolution to the crisis in Rwanda. We believe that in the\r\nrealm of maintaining regional peace and security, regional\r\narrangements have an important role to play, as envisaged\r\nin Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. This has\r\nbeen recognized by the exemplary collaboration between\r\nthe United Nations and ECOWAS on the Liberian\r\nsituation.\r\nIn this context also, the OAU mechanism for conflict\r\nprevention, management and resolution deserves the\r\nfullest support of the United Nations system and the\r\ninternational community. We are therefore deeply\r\nencouraged by the positive resonance of some members\r\nof the Security Council in that connection.\r\nWe must at this point applaud the action of the\r\nFrench Government in Rwanda at a time when this\r\nOrganization seemed completely paralysed. We believe\r\nthat the French action, which undoubtedly brought a\r\nglimmer of hope to a situation that was palpably so\r\ncatastrophic and which prevented a second Goma, is\r\nworthy of special mention by all peace-loving nations.\r\nWe also commend the efforts of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity. What is now required to stabilize the\r\nsituation even further is the provision of full support for\r\nthe African and other troops that have been or are about\r\nto be deployed in Rwanda. We also call upon the present\r\nRwandan Government to continue to take all measures\r\nnecessary to restore peace and reconciliation to their\r\ncountry.\r\nThough we must all learn the painful lessons of the\r\nRwandan experience, it is essential that those who played\r\na part — any part at all — in visiting such horror on the\r\npeople of Rwanda be held fully accountable for their\r\ncrimes. In this connection, my delegation fully supports\r\nthe establishment of a special tribunal to bring to justice\r\nthose responsible for what can only be described as\r\ngenocide. We expect that the Commission of Experts\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nwill continue to collect all available evidence to make for\r\na speedy conclusion of this shameful episode.\r\nIn a similar vein, we expect that the International\r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since\r\n1991 will soon begin the process of examining the available\r\nevidence in order to bring the perpetrators to justice. The\r\ninternational community has an obligation to ensure that\r\nsuch callous indifference to human life and the deliberate\r\ncommission of acts of atrocity, wherever they occur, do not\r\ngo unpunished. The time has come for a strong message to\r\nbe sent to all who may presume that no consequences will\r\nfollow from such despicable behaviour simply because it\r\ntakes place behind national borders.\r\nI wish to declare here and now that my Government\r\nrecognizes that no true governance can endure if people are\r\nseparated from and denied the full enjoyment of their\r\nfreedoms and liberties. Stemming from this recognition,\r\ntherefore, my Government has embarked on the major task\r\nof ratifying, as soon as possible, the remaining-human\r\nrights instruments to which Sierra Leone is not yet a party,\r\nthus guaranteeing within our domestic law their application\r\nto all Sierra Leoneans.\r\nAs conflicts go, none on our continent appears more\r\nintractable than that in Angola, where more than two\r\ndecades of devastation have fostered a culture of violence\r\nand war. The continuation of this conflict, which has cost\r\nthe lives of countless thousands of peaceful Angolans,\r\nremains a source of pain and anguish to my Government.\r\nAlthough not much optimism has been evinced, there\r\nseems to be some progress in the Lusaka peace talks. With\r\nthe acceptance by both the Angolan Government and\r\nUNITA of the comprehensive package put forward by the\r\nSecretary-General’s representative, there is now renewed\r\nhope that the talks will soon yield the desired result of a\r\ndurable solution. My delegation welcomes this\r\ndevelopment and would like to encourage both parties to\r\nthe conflict in Angola to allow the will of the Angolan\r\npeople to prevail over the barrel of the gun.\r\nOn the positive side, in a year that has been as volatile\r\nas this one, the knowledge that general elections will soon\r\ntake place in Mozambique is cause for satisfaction. We\r\ncall upon the people of Mozambique to seize this\r\nopportunity to firmly demonstrate faith in their own ability\r\nto resolve finally the many years of conflict they have\r\nendured. Africans everywhere, I am sure, will give their\r\nblessing as Mozambique embarks on the path to durable\r\npeace and reconciliation.\r\nAmong the many ills that afflict our world today,\r\nfew are more inimical to the common good than the\r\nalarming resurgence of racism and xenophobia. Our\r\nconcern is heightened even further when we recall that it\r\nis scarcely more than 50 years ago that the world\r\nwitnessed the worst manifestations of racial\r\ndiscrimination. Back then, passions were inflamed by\r\nthose who argued falsely that the presence of so-called\r\nforeigners was injurious to the economic well-being of the\r\nState.\r\nToday, this nefarious argument is once again gaining\r\nground among bigots who see immigrants, asylum-seekers\r\nand refugees from other countries as targets for violence.\r\nSurely civilization has come too far to accept this\r\nsituation. It is for this reason, if for no other, that we\r\nbelieve that the world community should intensify the\r\npromotion of the Third Decade to Combat Racism and\r\nRacial Discrimination and to ensure the success of its\r\nobjectives.\r\nTo many of us it seems that the socio-economic\r\nwell-being of our world is under siege from conflicts in\r\nmany lands, far and near. In the Organization, our\r\napproach has been the traditional reliance on peace-\r\nkeeping operations. Yet, recent experience has shown\r\nthat this is not always the best option. My delegation\r\nmaintains the view that the Organization would be better\r\nserved by committing the greater part of its scarce\r\nresources to socio-economic development activities and\r\npreventive diplomacy.\r\nMany questions will continue to be asked about the\r\ndirection that the United Nations must pursue as its\r\nfiftieth anniversary dawns. Of vital importance is still the\r\nneed to encourage and provide for the full participation of\r\nall Member States in the work of the Organization. In\r\nmany ways, we are convinced that the growing incidence\r\nof political instability worldwide is a strong advocate of\r\na more efficient, transparent and democratic Security\r\nCouncil — a Council cultivating a culture that frowns\r\nupon a few seeking always to wield dominion over the\r\nrest.\r\nThere is now a compelling case for the pursuit of the\r\ndemocratic ethic nationally. But it does not and should\r\nnot end there: it is equally relevant to the international\r\narena. My delegation hopes that the deliberations of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group, seized of the question of\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\ninstitutional reforms, will gather momentum and will bring\r\nthese concerns to fruition as soon as possible.\r\nI have adverted at length to our problems, our\r\nconcerns, our fears and our aspirations, which we believe\r\nwe all share in this global village that is home to all of us.\r\nOver the years, we have striven together to find solutions\r\nto a wide range of problems whose impact can no longer be\r\nlocalized. If our journey through the decades has taught us\r\nanything, it is that blinding ourselves to the realities of our\r\ntime, turning away from them, avoiding involvement or\r\nseeking solace in inaction provides only momentary\r\nconsolation or comfort. The quantum leap in transport and\r\ncommunications makes us all our brother’s keepers. No\r\nlonger is poverty merely the affliction of a distant cousin in\r\na far-off land, nor can we successfully shield ourselves\r\nfrom the trials and tribulations of those who may be less\r\nfortunate than we are.\r\nThe lesson to be learnt from all this is that, as human\r\nbeings, we have a fate inextricably interwoven, whether we\r\nlike it or not. Thus, our common endeavour to improve our\r\nworld should be impelled by a much bolder vision — one\r\nthat brooks no compromise in combating injustice, be it\r\npolitical, social or economic, and one that seeks to\r\nstrengthen the pillars of international cooperation, eradicate\r\npoverty and address the causes of instability.\r\nThese, then, are the challenges before us that a new\r\nand revitalized United Nations must pursue with vigour and\r\ncommitment. “An Agenda for Peace” and “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment” not only show that peace and development\r\nare inseparable twins but contain the essential ingredients\r\nof a new vision of our one world. Let us now give that\r\nvision the focus and direction of a better tomorrow.\r\nMr. Seniloli (Fiji): On behalf of the Government and\r\nthe people of Fiji, I warmly congratulate His Excellency\r\nMr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.\r\nGiven his vast experience and his knowledge of the United\r\nNations system, I have every confidence that the current\r\nsession of the Assembly will complete its work\r\nsuccessfully.\r\nI also wish to pay a special tribute to the outgoing\r\nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, for the\r\nexcellent and efficient manner in which he conducted the\r\nbusiness of the Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nMost of the problems afflicting the world community\r\nthat have been discussed in this Assembly in previous years\r\ncontinue unchanged. A survey of the world scene readily\r\ndiscloses that no region of the world is free from tension;\r\nthat the economic divide between the rich and the poor\r\ncontinues to widen; that political and social upheavals in\r\nmany parts of the world are getting extremely difficult\r\nand expensive to contain; and that poverty and despair\r\nremain the lot of a substantial part of the world’s\r\npopulation. There is an urgent need to address these\r\nproblems in a comprehensive and timely manner. The\r\npiecemeal approach that we have adopted so far only\r\ntends to plug the hole and does not eliminate the causes.\r\nMoreover, our efforts are invariably made after an event\r\nhas occurred, and often when our conscience cannot bear\r\nto see the misery on our television screens. We must\r\ndevise ways for a more preventive approach to the\r\nproblems.\r\nPolitical problems are often a consequence of\r\neconomic and social problems. The General Assembly’s\r\ndecision at its forty-seventh session to convene a World\r\nSummit for Social Development at Copenhagen early in\r\n1995 was very timely. While we have seen some\r\nsignificant advances in human rights and democracy in\r\nmany parts of the world, and positive developments\r\ntowards reducing the potential for regional conflicts in\r\nother areas, the fact remains that in both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries new challenges to international\r\npeace and security are manifesting themselves under a\r\nbroad plethora of social development problems. We can\r\nno longer turn a blind eye to the increasing growth of\r\npoverty and unemployment and the attendant\r\nmarginalization of peoples.\r\nAnnually, between 13 to 18 million people die from\r\nstarvation, disease and famine. It has been estimated that\r\nworld wide one out of every five people live below the\r\npoverty line. While Governments, in many cases,\r\nequivocate on how to solve this problem, the poor\r\nincreasingly look to the United Nations to find effective,\r\nimmediate and practical solutions. To ignore this reality\r\nis to deny that it constitutes a real source of political\r\ninstability.\r\nIndeed, the Security council has expressed the view\r\nthat\r\n“peace and prosperity are indivisible and that lasting\r\npeace and stability require effective international\r\ncooperation for the eradication of poverty and the\r\npromotion of a better life for all in larger freedom.”\r\n(S/23500, p. 5)\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nThese views are buttressed by the prophetic words of\r\nthe Nobel laureate Ralph Bunche who, as long ago as 1950,\r\nsaid:\r\n“Peace is no mere matter of men fighting or not\r\nfighting. Peace, to have meaning for many who have\r\nknown only suffering in both peace and war, must be\r\ntranslated into bread or rice, shelter, health and\r\neducation, as well as freedom and human dignity —\r\na steadily better life. If peace is to be secure, long-\r\nsuffering and long-starved peoples of the world, the\r\nunderprivileged and the undernourished, must begin to\r\nrealize without delay the promise of a new day and a\r\nnew life.”\r\nWhile these words were uttered in a different context,\r\nI would suggest that they encapsulate the whole reason for\r\nthe social Summit. My Government will actively support\r\nand work in cooperation with other countries to achieve the\r\nobjectives of the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nMy Government looks forward to playing an active\r\nrole in the forthcoming World Conference on Women, to be\r\nheld in Beijing next September. Fiji has always recognized\r\nthe important contribution of women to society and to the\r\ndevelopment process in general.\r\nIn 1987, the Fiji Government established a Ministry of\r\nWomen. A Department on Women and Culture, which\r\noperates under the purview of this Ministry, carries the\r\nresponsibility of monitoring improvements in the status of\r\nwomen. It seeks to encourage the private and public\r\nsectors to address the needs of women in their policies and\r\nprogrammes. It is also the Government’s policy to assign\r\n50 per cent of representation in training, appointments and\r\npromotions at all levels of the civil service to women, on\r\nthe basis of preference and merit. The Government\r\nencourages the same in the private sector. I might also\r\nmention that all three women members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives in Fiji are Ministers in the Cabinet.\r\nMy Government will continue to enhance and uplift\r\nthe status of women. It is in the process of ratifying the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\r\nof Discrimination against Women. Fiji will also explore\r\nmembership of the Commission on the Status of Women,\r\nin keeping with its policy of strengthening the role of\r\nwomen in the country’s national development plans. On\r\nthe issue of gender equity, it is my belief that in order that\r\nthe principles enshrined in the first Article of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations to be achieved, the equal participation\r\nof women in the Secretariat of this Organization, on an\r\nequitable regional basis, must continue to be implemented\r\nand be given urgent priority.\r\nMy country was pleased to have participated in the\r\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States in Barbados earlier this\r\nyear. In short, the Conference was convened because of\r\na universal recognition of the problems faced by small\r\nisland developing States in achieving sustainable\r\ndevelopment goals. While the Barbados Conference was\r\nimportant in re-emphasizing the special environmental and\r\neconomic circumstances of small island States, my\r\ndelegation wishes to reiterate that the Conference was\r\nonly the beginning of a process. We must now act to\r\nimplement the Barbados Programme of Action and\r\nDeclaration.\r\nIn this connection, we would urge the international\r\ncommunity, and particularly those countries with\r\ndeveloped and industrialized economies, to respond to the\r\ninvitation to enhance and promote human resource\r\ndevelopment programmes in small island developing\r\ncountries. Increased technical assistance will enhance the\r\ninstitutional and administrative capacity of small island\r\ncountries to implement the Programme of Action. One of\r\nthe ways in which this can be brought about is by the\r\nprovision of new and additional financial resources in\r\naccordance with Chapter 33 of Agenda 21. Unless\r\ncreative and supportive international responses to the\r\nspecial challenges faced by small island developing\r\ncountries in planning for sustainable development are\r\nurgently stimulated, I fear that their continuing\r\nvulnerability to both physical and socio-economic forces\r\nwill increase. In this context it is opportune to remind\r\nthe global community to fulfil the commitments it made\r\nat Rio some two years ago.\r\nWe are on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations. My country strongly\r\nsupports the principles contained in the Charter and I\r\nwould like to reaffirm our support for the Organization.\r\nOver the past 50 years, the Organization has seen many\r\nchanges. Its membership has increased from 51 to the\r\npresent 184. With the end of the cold war, it has\r\nassumed a more central role in world affairs. There is an\r\never-increasing demand on the limited resources of the\r\nOrganization and, in particular, on its Secretariat. We\r\nsupport the Secretariat and commend the adjustments it is\r\nmaking in order to respond to the changing needs of the\r\ninternational community. We urge the Secretariat to\r\ncontinue to pursue the goals of efficiency and\r\ncost-effectiveness. In this regard, my Government\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nwelcomes the creation of the Office of Internal Oversight\r\nServices. We believe this to be an important innovation that\r\nwill contribute to greater efficiency within the United\r\nNations system. We fully support the continuing efforts to\r\nbring about greater transparency and accountability on the\r\npart of the United Nations management and institutional\r\nstructures.\r\nIn the same vein, Mr. President, my Government\r\nsupports the view that it is now time that the current\r\nstructure and the membership of the Security Council were\r\nreviewed. With the very large increase in the membership\r\nof the United Nations since it was founded, with the\r\nchanges that have occurred on the global political scene in\r\nrecent years, and with the nature of problems that must be\r\nresolved by the United Nations, including the diverse facets\r\nof economic, environmental and peace-keeping and\r\npeace-monitoring issues, we agree that there is now a need\r\nto consider an enlarged Security Council with more\r\nequitable representation of membership to look at these\r\nissues more comprehensively.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/48/47) in response to General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/26 of 3 December 1993, and the\r\nrecommendation that the Open-Ended Working Group\r\nshould continue its work. In the event that membership of\r\nthe Security Council is expanded, Fiji fully supports the\r\nmembership of Japan, recognizing its important role not\r\nonly as a valued neighbour in the Asia-Pacific region, but\r\nalso as a key player in the global economy.\r\nMy Government has followed with close and keen\r\ninterest, meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on the\r\nElaboration of an International Convention dealing with the\r\nSafety and Security of United Nations and Associated\r\nPersonnel. We consider the United Nations staff and\r\nassociated personnel who participate in various missions\r\nsponsored by the United Nations as an integral and essential\r\npart of those missions. We have seen their courage in\r\nCambodia, Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and other places\r\naround the world. If the United Nations is to continue to\r\nrely on individual men and women to assist in carrying out\r\nthe mandates of its various organs, it is only fair and fitting\r\nthat we should provide them with an adequate level of\r\nsafety and security. At its last session, the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee worked very constructively and made significant\r\nprogress. However, it is important for the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee to conclude its work as soon as possible and we\r\nurge that this be done. We have a very real interest in the\r\nconclusion of this convention since in as much as Fiji has\r\nlost some of its nationals in various peace-keeping\r\noperations, and many others have been injured. For us,\r\ntherefore, peace-keeping has come at a high price. It\r\ninvolves the sacrifices, not only of individuals, but also of\r\nthe families left behind. But my Government remains\r\nunshaken in its belief that the price we have paid and are\r\ncontinuing to pay for our involvement in United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations would have been worthwhile if\r\nwe have contributed towards making the world a safer\r\nplace. We owe this to our children and to our children’s\r\nchildren.\r\nAt the present time, there are at least l,000 troops\r\nfrom Fiji serving in various peace-keeping operations - in\r\nLebanon, Sinai, Iraq, Kuwait and Rwanda. Only recently\r\nwe agreed to participate in the regional peace-keeping\r\nforce in Bougainville in Papua New Guinea. This was in\r\ndirect response to a request we received from the\r\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea, with the support of\r\nthe relevant parties in Bougainville. Our participation in\r\nthe South Pacific regional peace-keeping force for\r\nBougainville is in concert with our other neighbours in\r\nthe South Pacific, namely Tonga, Vanuatu, Solomon\r\nIslands, Australia and New Zealand. Our participation is\r\nalso for a specific purpose, and that is to assist the\r\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea and the relevant\r\nparties on Bougainville in facilitating a secure\r\nenvironment in which they will be able to hold a peace\r\nconference and, through dialogue, achieve a consensus on\r\nthe future of Bougainville. Let me say that our\r\ncommitment to peace-keeping is a continuing affirmation\r\nof our belief that the purposes and principles set forth in\r\nthe United Nations Charter must be given practical\r\nexpression. Fiji, as a responsible member of the\r\ninternational community, will continue to play its role in\r\nthe enhancement of global peace and security.\r\nOn the subject of peace-keeping, I want at this time\r\nto express my Government’s satisfaction at the\r\nstrengthening of the Department of Peace-keeping\r\nOperations. I believe that continued innovations in the\r\ninstitutional structure of this Department will be necessary\r\nif it is to play a meaningful and effective role in support\r\nof United Nations peace-keeping activities.\r\nThis year marks an important milestone in the\r\ndevelopment of the international law of the sea. Fiji was\r\nthe first State to ratify the 1982 United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. We are therefore\r\npleased that, 12 years after its adoption, the Convention\r\nwill enter into force on 16 November 1994. The\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nConvention represents a historic achievement by the\r\ninternational community. It will establish the rule of law\r\nover more than two-thirds of the Earth’s surface, and\r\npromote its peaceful use. Like many other States, Fiji has\r\nalready been implementing the provisions of the\r\nConvention, through its Marine Spaces Act. Entry into\r\nforce of the Convention would thus consolidate our claims\r\nto the archipelagic waters, the territorial sea and the\r\nexclusive economic zone. Fiji has always supported\r\nuniversal participation in the Convention. We therefore\r\nwelcome the conclusion of the Agreement to resolve the\r\noutstanding issues relating to the deep seabed mining part\r\nof the Convention, part XI. As at the Conference on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, our delegation, together with other\r\ndelegations, was pleased to play an active and constructive\r\nrole in bringing about that important agreement. We have\r\nsigned the agreement and will become a party to it. We\r\nurge all States that have not done so to become parties to\r\nthe Convention and to the new Agreement in order to\r\nachieve the goal of universal participation.\r\nAssociated with the law of the sea is the important\r\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks. Fish is an invaluable gift of nature to man.\r\nHowever, man’s unregulated and indiscriminate exploitation\r\nof this vital resource is rapidly depleting or destroying it.\r\nFish is an important national and regional resource and it is\r\na staple in our diet. In addition to other species, some 40\r\nper cent of the world’s tuna is to be found in the south-\r\nwest Pacific region. We are therefore concerned at the\r\nlong-term impact on these resources and on the marine eco-\r\nsystem as a whole, if the current practice of uncontrolled\r\nfishing, especially on the high seas, continues. The\r\nConference has been organized to address the urgent\r\nproblems facing us with regard to the conservation and\r\nmanagement of fisheries around the world. These problems\r\nmust be addressed from the perspective of both present and\r\nfuture generations. Fiji therefore strongly supports an\r\neffective outcome from the Conference, an outcome that\r\nwould ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable\r\nuse of the fish resources of the seas and oceans. Our\r\ndelegation, in cooperation with other delegations to the\r\nConference, will spare no effort in working towards this\r\ngoal. We are grateful for the confidence shown in our\r\ncountry by our election as Chairman of the Conference.\r\nSince the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly, we have witnessed positive and constructive\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process. It is\r\nalmost a year now since the Declaration of Principles was\r\nsigned between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO). This was followed by the agreement\r\non the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area signed at Cairo in\r\nMay this year. The recent peace accord between Israel\r\nand Jordan, which was signed at Washington last July,\r\nwas another very positive development. My Government\r\nlends its support to the Middle East peace process. In\r\nparticular, we express the hope that the ongoing bilateral\r\nnegotiations between Israel and Jordan and between Israel\r\nand the Palestinians will continue. We are also hopeful\r\nthat the present dialogue between Syria, Lebanon and\r\nIsrael will eventually lead to further agreements.\r\nI would now like to mention a number of issues in\r\nmy own region, the South Pacific. One is New\r\nCaledonia. While some positive developments have been\r\ntaking place in New Caledonia in relation to the\r\ncontinued implementation of the Matignon Accords, I\r\nbelieve that there is still a need to accelerate the process\r\nof redressing social and economic imbalances in the\r\nterritory. In this connection, my Government will\r\ncontinue to observe developments in New Caledonia with\r\nkeen interest in the build-up to the referendum to be held\r\nin 1998.\r\nNuclear issues and transboundary movements of\r\nhazardous and radioactive wastes are also of considerable\r\nconcern to us in the South Pacific region. Fiji has long\r\nbeen a consistent opponent of nuclear testing anywhere\r\nand in any environment. Our opposition to such testing\r\nis by no means based only on environmental concerns.\r\nFor hundreds of years, the livelihood of our people has\r\ndepended on their limited land and on the resources in the\r\nmarine environment. Fundamentally, our abhorrence of\r\nnuclear arms and nuclear testing is based on the belief\r\nthat there is simply no place for nuclear weapons in our\r\nregion, or indeed in any other part of the world. In this\r\nconnection, we have been pleased to note the temporary\r\ncessation of nuclear testing in the Pacific region by\r\nFrance, and would urge the French Government to agree\r\nto a permanent moratorium on testing in the South\r\nPacific.\r\nFiji is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons. We believe that the Treaty\r\nrepresents a unique achievement in the promotion of\r\nglobal peace and security and in the reduction of the\r\nthreat of nuclear warfare. The Pacific region has long\r\nrecognized and embraced the principles enshrined in the\r\nTreaty, and these principles are now reflected in the\r\nTreaty of Rarotonga, which establishes the South Pacific\r\nas a nuclear-free zone. We would, in this regard,\r\nencourage the United States, the United Kingdom and\r\nFrance to accede to the Protocols to the Treaty of\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nRarotonga as a demonstration of their commitment to\r\nnuclear non-proliferation and to a ban on testing in the\r\nSouth Pacific.\r\nWe are equally concerned about the transboundary\r\nmovements — and, in particular, about the sea transit\r\nthrough the region — of consignments of plutonium from\r\nEurope to Japan. For obvious reasons, we object very\r\nstrongly to this development and earnestly hope that there\r\nwill be no more such shipments through the region.\r\nThe countries of the South Pacific region are also\r\ncurrently in the process of negotiating a regional convention\r\nto ban the importation into the island States of the South\r\nPacific Forum of hazardous wastes and to control their\r\ntransboundary movement and management within the South\r\nPacific region. My country fully supports this initiative and\r\nis actively engaged in the negotiation process. The\r\nconvention is expected to be adopted in mid-1995. This\r\nwill further strengthen our resolve to keep the South Pacific\r\nregion free of radioactive and hazardous wastes.\r\nAt the national level, the Government of Fiji has\r\ncommenced work on the review of the country’s 1990\r\nConstitution. The members of the Parliamentary Select\r\nCommittee on the Review of the Constitution have already\r\nbeen announced. They have been drawn from both sides of\r\nthe House of Representatives and from the Senate, and\r\nrepresent all the racial groups in our population. As\r\nChairman of that Committee, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs with Special Responsibilities on Constitutional\r\nReview, Senator Filipe N. Bole, had a fruitful meeting of\r\nthe Committee only a few days ago. Last November, the\r\nCabinet agreed to the timetable for the review of the\r\nConstitution, following the approval, by Parliament, of the\r\nterms of reference of the Constitution Review Commission.\r\nBecause of the general elections that were held in Fiji in\r\nFebruary of this year, the review process has been slightly\r\ndelayed, but it is expected that the substantive work of the\r\nCommission will begin soon after the Commission has been\r\nappointed, which will be done shortly.\r\nFiji has a very small, export-oriented economy that\r\ncannot isolate itself from the vagaries of the global\r\neconomy. We are less able to absorb adverse trends in\r\nexternal economic conditions than are larger and more\r\ndiversified economies; equally, an improvement in the\r\nglobal economy is slow to be reflected in our own small\r\neconomy. Like many small developing countries, we are\r\nstill in the process of gradual recovery following a\r\nprolonged downturn that afflicted the world as a whole.\r\nLike many countries, we have had to adjust our economic\r\npolicies in such a way as to give them a more\r\nmarket-oriented approach. This has involved the\r\nfollowing fundamentals: less interference with the market;\r\nrecognition that the Government cannot do everything and\r\nthat the private sector is the engine for development,\r\nwhich the Government must complement rather than\r\ncompete with; and the encouragement of, and reward for,\r\nentrepreneurship, skills, abilities and hard work. In this\r\nmanner we are proceeding with the deregulation of the\r\neconomy to bring domestic prices more closely into line\r\nwith world prices; restraining the growth of Government\r\nexpenditure to ensure availability of resources for growth\r\nin the private sector; reforming the system of direct and\r\nindirect taxation to minimize market distortions and\r\nimprove incentives for risk-taking and effort;\r\nimplementing wage policies that recognize the paramount\r\nimportance of maintaining international competitiveness;\r\nand mobilizing all sectors of the community in support of\r\neconomic expansion. These constitute a package of\r\nmutually self-reinforcing policies.\r\nIn a world that is economically interlinked and in\r\nwhich we are all economically interdependent, no country,\r\nhowever well-intentioned its national efforts might be, can\r\nsustain itself without support and interaction from outside.\r\nThis is true of large, diversified economies, and it is\r\ncertainly true for small, isolated economies such as ours.\r\nOur internal efforts to create a better economic climate,\r\nif not supported by external investments, will not succeed.\r\nNor will they succeed if we are denied or prevented from\r\ngetting access to markets of more developed countries.\r\nOur efforts, therefore, depend considerably on investment\r\nfrom outside and on access for our products to traditional\r\nand new markets. In this regard, we express our gratitude\r\nto our developed neighbouring countries for the\r\nconsideration they have given to some of our exports.\r\nWe believe, however, that in the spirit of regional\r\ncooperation and better balance in trade the present\r\narrangements must be further improved.\r\nIn our efforts to develop our economy, we also\r\ncount on the support and understanding of our good\r\nfriends and partners in our neighbouring region of Asia.\r\nWe value our increasing contacts and economic relations,\r\nparticularly with the countries of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations, Malaysia, the People’s\r\nRepublic of China, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan,\r\nand we are confident that these relations will continue to\r\nbe strengthened in the future.\r\nOur Prime Minister, the Honourable Major-General\r\nSitiveni Rabuka, greatly appreciated the warm welcome\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nthat he received during his recent visit to the People’s\r\nRepublic of China and Taiwan. Fiji remains committed to\r\nits official relations with the People’s Republic of China but\r\nalso greatly values its trade and economic cooperation with\r\nTaiwan. It is our sincere hope that the People’s Republic\r\nof China and Taiwan, in continued direct talks and\r\nnegotiations, will be able to reach agreement on a\r\npracticable basis on which to strengthen and expand\r\ncooperation between them, including cooperation in the\r\ninternational arena.\r\nThe establishment of the South Pacific Forum in 1971\r\nwas an early initiative taken by Fiji following its\r\nindependence, together with Australia, the Cook Islands,\r\nNauru, New Zealand, Tonga and Western Samoa. The\r\nForum now has 15 members, and it meets at the level of\r\nHeads of Government. The Forum originated from the\r\ndesire of our leaders to develop collective responses on a\r\nwide range of regional issues, including trade, economic\r\ndevelopment, civil aviation, maritime, telecommunications,\r\nenergy, environmental, and political and security matters.\r\nOne significant recent development is the post-Forum\r\ndialogue: immediately after a Forum meeting, the Forum\r\nisland countries meet separately with their more developed\r\ntrade and economic partners to discuss development\r\npriorities and constraints in the region. The post-Forum\r\ndialogue partners include Canada, the People’s Republic of\r\nChina, France, Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the\r\nUnited States. From our perspective as small island nations\r\nwhose economies, to remain viable, depend to a very large\r\nextent on economic ties with these larger and more\r\nvigorous economies, we value these discussions and are\r\nconfident that they will continue.\r\nIn a wider context, we of the South Pacific Forum\r\nbelieve that it is important and indeed mutually beneficial\r\nfor the Forum Secretariat to be more closely associated\r\nwith the United Nations. For this reason, the Forum\r\nmembers have decided to seek Observer status in this\r\nOrganization for the South Pacific Forum Secretariat. We\r\nurge the General Assembly to give favourable consideration\r\nto this request.\r\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress, from this rostrum, the appreciation and profound\r\nthanks of my Government and people to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the staff of the United Nations and its various\r\norganizations and agencies for their continued support for,\r\nand technical assistance to, our national development, and\r\nindeed, for the numerous development projects in our\r\nregion as a whole. In these times, when valuable resources\r\nfor development purposes are becoming more and more\r\nscarce and difficult to come by, I wish to assure the\r\ndonors and agencies that my Government will manage\r\nand utilize these scarce resources carefully and\r\neffectively.\r\nThe President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right\r\nof reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Zacharakis (Greece): My delegation feels\r\nobliged, in exercise of its right of reply, to respond to the\r\ninflammatory statement made yesterday by the Foreign\r\nMinister of Albania.\r\nGreece has always sought to develop good-\r\nneighbourly relations with Albania based on mutual\r\nrespect for sovereignty, for territorial integrity and for\r\nrespect for human rights and democratic freedoms, in\r\nkeeping with the fundamental principles of the United\r\nNations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE) and the Council of Europe.\r\nGreece was the first country to support Albania in\r\nevery possible way in its process of democratization and\r\neconomic development. Regrettably, the amicable and\r\nsupportive attitude shown by Greece has not been\r\nreciprocated by the present regime in Albania.\r\nThe large Greek minority in Albania, which was\r\ndeprived of all its rights and endured untold sufferings\r\nduring the previous regime, hoped that with the fall of\r\ntotalitarianism it would be treated in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of internationally recognized instruments\r\npertaining to respect for human rights and to the\r\nprotection of minorities. However, little has changed:\r\nfundamental human rights, especially in the areas of\r\neducation and religion, continue to be violated in spite of\r\nthe verbal assurances to the contrary given by the\r\nAlbanian Government. These oppressive policies\r\nculminated in the arrest and trial of five prominent\r\nmembers of the Greek minority.\r\nMay I recall in this respect that on 17 August 1994,\r\nthe United Nations Subcommission on Prevention of\r\nDiscrimination and Protection of Minorities adopted a\r\nresolution expressing concern at the violations of human\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nrights and the persecution of members of the Greek ethnic\r\nminority in Albania and called upon the Government in\r\nAlbania\r\n“to abide by the relevant provisions of the ...\r\ninternational human rights instruments, and to take\r\nimmediately every measure to ensure that charged\r\npersons receive a fair trial ...”.\r\nIn defiance of these recommendations, the Albanian\r\nGovernment staged a political trial worthy of the darkest\r\ndays of the authoritarian regime, a parody of the\r\nadministration of justice, according to unprejudiced\r\nobservers from international organizations and institutions.\r\nI do not wish to go into the details included in the\r\nnumerous reports and resolutions presented in this respect\r\nby many international bodies. I will simply limit myself to\r\nmentioning the report of Professor Andrej Rjeplinski,\r\nappointed by the CSCE to monitor the trial, which lists a\r\nlong series of serious and flagrant irregularities observed\r\nbefore and during the trial, which, I should stress, was\r\nconducted according to the penal and procedure code of\r\nEnver Hoxha, still valid in Albania.\r\nMay I also recall the 29 September 1994 report of the\r\nMinnesota Advocates of Human Rights, as well as the letter\r\naddressed to President Berisha on 8 September 1994 by the\r\nHuman Rights Watch/Helsinki, which expressed concern at\r\nthe conviction of five ethnic Greeks “who were denied\r\nbasic procedural protection”, and called on the Albanian\r\nGovernment\r\n“to respect the rights of all persons within its\r\njurisdiction to free expression and association without\r\ndiscrimination on the basis of ethnic origin or\r\nnationality.”\r\nMay I finally recall that the European Parliament, in\r\nits resolution adopted by an overwhelming majority on 18\r\nSeptember 1994, expressed\r\n“[concern] at complaints already formulated by foreign\r\nobservers ... concerning violations of fundamental\r\nhuman rights, ... the accused having been humiliated,\r\nimprisoned in inhuman conditions, tortured and\r\ndeprived of communication ... whereas journalists\r\nwere victims of insults and brutality and some of them\r\nhave been expelled”.\r\nThe European Parliament called on the Albanian\r\nGovernment to immediately release the representatives of\r\nthe ethnic minority and at the same time requested that\r\nthe Council bring pressure to bear on the Albanian\r\nGovernment “to fulfil its obligations to the Union and to\r\nspeed up the democratization process” and “ensure the\r\nrule of law”.\r\nIt is difficult to understand how all these summons\r\nand recommendations could be presented to this\r\nAssembly by the Albanian Foreign Minister as a source\r\nof satisfaction with his Government’s achievements in the\r\nprocess of democratization.\r\nRegarding economic assistance from the European\r\nUnion to Albania, I wish to point out that Greece has\r\nagreed to the granting of 15 million ECUs to Albania. It\r\nis obvious, though, that this assistance is intended to help\r\nthe recipient country in the process of democratization\r\nand not to encourage it in its oppressive policies. In view\r\nof the deplorable event I have just referred to, Greece felt\r\nobliged to withhold the granting of this assistance until\r\nAlbania demonstrates in practice its respect for basic rules\r\nof law and democratic freedoms.\r\nRegarding the illegal immigrant workers, it should\r\nbe noted that in recent years about 250,000 to 300,000\r\nAlbanians crossed the Greek border seeking better\r\nconditions of life in Greece. This impressive number of\r\nillegal immigrants, which is quite out of proportion with\r\nthe capacities of Greece, is partly due to the tolerance\r\nshown for humanitarian reasons by the Greek authorities\r\ntowards this suffering neighbour people. May I add that\r\nthe massive flow of remittances sent regularly to Albania\r\nconstitutes a very important source of income for the\r\nailing Albanian economy, a source which we thought\r\nwould be duly appreciated.\r\nIn order to cope with this problem in an orderly\r\nway, eight months ago the Greek Government proposed\r\nthe conclusion of an agreement for seasonal employment\r\nand thus the legalization of Albanian workers in Greece,\r\nbut the Albanian Government has not even responded.\r\nThe Albanian Government’s attitude was equally negative\r\nto our proposal for transborder cooperation and the\r\nprevention of crime.\r\nFaced with this situation, Greece could not but take\r\nthe necessary measures provided for in its legislation,\r\nwhich is by no means punitive or more severe or\r\nrestrictive than the legislation applied in such\r\ncircumstances by other States of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nAs to the alleged mistreatment of these illegal\r\nimmigrants, suffice it to say that when deported they\r\npublicly declared to the mass media that their only desire\r\nwas to return to Greece as soon as possible.\r\nUnfortunately, in view of the limited time allotted for\r\nthe right of reply, it is not possible for my delegation to\r\nrefute any single allegation, if indeed they were worthy of\r\nbeing refuted.\r\nI would only like to add a few words concerning the\r\nutterly misleading and historically false allegations of the\r\nAlbanian Foreign Minister with regard to the so-called\r\nAlbanian minority in Greece known as the Tsamis. The\r\nAlbanian Minister deliberately attempted to misinform this\r\nAssembly by beautifying his case, but he conveniently\r\nomitted to say that the Tsamis actively collaborated with\r\nthe Axis Powers during the occupation of Greece and then\r\nchose to follow their Fascist and Nazi masters in 1946 to\r\nAlbania, where they settled for obvious reasons.\r\nI would not have taken this Assembly’s time if the\r\nissues that I mentioned were merely bilateral differences\r\nbetween Greece and Albania — but they are not. They are\r\nmatters of broader interest, particularly to the United\r\nNations, since they relate directly to respect for human\r\nrights and the fundamental freedoms of the individual.\r\nIn this context, I think Albania, instead of launching\r\nunwarranted attacks against Greece and shrugging off its\r\nresponsibility for the sad state of affairs prevailing in its\r\nterritory, would do better to take into due consideration the\r\nsummonses, appeals and advice addressed to it by the\r\ninternational community and to try to ensure the rule of law\r\nto the benefit of its whole population.\r\nAs the Greek Foreign Minister stated before the\r\nAssembly five days ago, Greece would be ready to respond\r\npositively to any concrete signs that Albania is willing to\r\nabide by its international commitments.\r\nHowever, the statement of the Albanian Foreign\r\nMinister was reminiscent of a bygone era and showed that\r\nAlbania has a long way to go before it can claim a place in\r\nthe family of democratic European nations.\r\nMr. Takht-Ravanchi (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nToday the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates\r\nmade some unacceptable remarks about the territorial\r\nintegrity of my country, and he made erroneous claims\r\nabout the Islands of Abu Moussa, Greater Tumb and Lesser\r\nTumb, which since time immemorial have been part of\r\nIranian territory. He painted a picture of facts, events and\r\ndevelopments concerning the islands and relations with\r\nIran which do not stand even the most lenient tests of\r\nveracity.\r\nDespite all the polemic on the virtues of dialogue\r\nand negotiations with the Government of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, the fact remains that our Foreign\r\nMinister was last in the United Arab Emirates in 1992.\r\nThe issue was discussed there, and he invited officials of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates to resume negotiations in\r\nTehran, an offer which still stands. However, the United\r\nArab Emirates has yet to respond to this offer. It has, in\r\nfact, opted for a tactic of sensationalizing the issue and\r\nexploiting some organizations, without an Iranian\r\npresence, to adopt unfounded statements.\r\nEven the statement of the Foreign Minister of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates this morning clearly shows that his\r\nGovernment continues to refuse to engage in serious\r\ndialogue and direct negotiations, in contravention of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and the rules and norms of\r\ninternational law. It was interesting to note that the\r\nForeign Minister of the United Arab Emirates expressed\r\nthe previous desire of his Government for direct\r\nnegotiations with the Government of the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran, but he also determined in advance the purpose\r\nand outcome of such direct negotiations.\r\nI would like to respectfully submit to the Foreign\r\nMinister of the United Arab Emirates that direct\r\nnegotiation is usually conducted to find a just solution to\r\na common problem and not to guarantee the pre-\r\ndetermined objective of one party. For our part, on\r\nbehalf of my Government, I announce once again the\r\ncontinued preparedness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to\r\nresume direct negotiations without any preconditions.\r\nThe agreement of 1971 is alive and well, and it will be\r\nthe basis of our common efforts, in the context of direct\r\nnegotiations, to sort out our difficulties.\r\nMy delegation fails to understand the genuine utility\r\nof this public exercise that the Foreign Minister of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates is inventing, to wit, declaiming\r\nsovereignty against parts of the territory of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran in international gatherings, including the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Of course, the utility of the statement\r\nI am now making in response to the Foreign Minister of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates is also questionable, except as\r\na means of setting the record straight. We owe it to our\r\npeople and to history to abandon policies of provocation,\r\nirredentism and opportunism. Instead, we should\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nearnestly seek to resolve our differences amicably and\r\ndispassionately so as to reinforce mutual confidence and\r\ngood-neighbourly relations.\r\nUnfortunately, we are not convinced that the officials\r\nof the United Arab Emirates have the same approach to\r\nproblem-solving or perhaps even the same agenda for the\r\nregion. Their intransigent behaviour and approach in the\r\nlast few years, particularly their refusal from the very\r\nbeginning to engage in serious negotiations, and their\r\nattempts to have this or that Arab group pronounce itself on\r\nthe issue are both evidence of our claim that the United\r\nArab Emirates has yet to muster the necessary courage and\r\nwill to withstand the not-so-tacit pressure and\r\nencouragement from within and without the region to\r\nmaintain the prevailing inertia in the region and possibly\r\neven exacerbate the situation.\r\nIn our view, certain Governments in the region and\r\nbeyond are exploiting the situation, cheering on the officials\r\nof the United Arab Emirates to gradually adopt an\r\nantagonistic approach towards the issue at hand in order to\r\nachieve their own short-sighted political objectives. We\r\nhave no doubt that such an approach will not ensure their\r\nlong-term interests, the interests of the United Arab\r\nEmirates or those of the region as a whole.\r\nMy Government continues to be prepared to take up\r\nthe matter directly with officials of the United Arab\r\nEmirates. We are earnest in our invitation to United Arab\r\nEmirates officials to come to Tehran to resume serious\r\nbilateral talks without any preconditions. This offer has\r\nbeen made on a number of occasions, and, at the risk of\r\nbeing redundant, I announce here in the Assembly, on\r\nbehalf of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran,\r\nthat the officials of the United Arab Emirates have a\r\nstanding invitation to engage in serious talks with a view to\r\nresolving the issue once and for all in Tehran. We are\r\nprepared to receive their delegation as early as this coming\r\nweek.\r\nA few days ago — on 26 September — in his\r\nstatement in this Assembly, my Foreign Minister expounded\r\non the concept held by the Islamic Republic of Iran of the\r\nbroader issues of peace, security and the perception of\r\nthreats, as well as on the cardinal importance of general\r\nrules of international law, which, of course, include the\r\nunacceptability of claims on the territories of others.\r\nRespect for these principles and their full implementation\r\nare critical for future generations of our peoples in the\r\nregion to resolve our political differences and begin the real\r\nrace: the race for development and prosperity, a race in\r\nwhich our region has a lot of catching up to do as\r\ncompared with other regions.\r\nI do not think that this is the time or place to go\r\nfurther on these issues. However, I would like to confirm\r\nto the delegation of the United Arab Emirates the\r\ndetermination of the Government of the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran to enhance the brotherly and good-neighbourly\r\nrelations between the two countries, which would, among\r\nother things, entail avoiding sensationalism and\r\ndeveloping the earnest will to resolve differences\r\namicably, two qualities which I assure the representative\r\nof the United Arab Emirates he will find in abundance in\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nMr. Al-Suwaidi (United Arab Emirates)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): I have listened to the\r\nrepresentative of Iran and as I am aware of the limited\r\nand precious time at our disposal, I shall be very brief\r\nand shall focus on the facts in reaffirmation of what we\r\nhave said already in our statement this morning.\r\nAllow me to comment on the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning\r\nGreater Tumb, Lesser Tumb and Abu Moussa, the three\r\nislands of the United Arab Emirates that were forcibly\r\noccupied by Iran in 1971, an occupation in the course of\r\nwhich Iran murdered and displaced citizens of the\r\nEmirates who inhabited those islands. The historical,\r\ndocumented facts make it clear that the day the Iranian\r\nforces landed on the three islands in 1971, there was not\r\na single Iranian national on any of them.\r\nAll these are facts which refute the claims put\r\nforward by the Iranian Government to justify its\r\noccupation of these islands. Since the beginning of that\r\noccupation, the United Arab Emirates has rejected this act\r\nof Iranian aggression and occupation of its three islands,\r\nan act which runs counter to the United Nations Charter\r\nand the rules of international law. The United Arab\r\nEmirates has unswervingly reaffirmed its legitimate\r\nsovereignty over those islands. Over the years, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates has repeatedly expressed its earnest\r\ndesire and readiness to enter into serious, direct\r\nnegotiations with the Iranian Government to reach a\r\nsettlement to the conflict that would put a peaceful end to\r\nthe Iranian occupation and fully restore the sovereignty of\r\nUnited Arab Emirates over the three islands.\r\nMy country regrets the prevarication and\r\nprocrastination which are still being pursued by Iran with\r\nregard to the holding of serious, direct negotiations on the\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 5 October 1994\r\nquestion of the three islands and Iran’s insistence on\r\ndiscussing marginal and wholly formal questions that have\r\nnothing to do with the essence of the conflict which centres\r\non the issue of occupation and the full sovereignty of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates over the three occupied islands. The\r\nUnited Arab Emirates rejects the approach of escalation and\r\nthe threat of use of military force pursued by the\r\nGovernment of Iran.\r\nIt also rejects the steps taken by that Government to\r\nalter the demographic character and consolidate its\r\noccupation of the islands, the latest of which has been the\r\nsetting up of an air route between Bandar Abbas and Abu\r\nMoussa and the establishment of a desalination plant on\r\nthat island.\r\nUnder the principles of international law the Iranian\r\noccupation of the islands cannot alter their legal status or\r\nbestow sovereignty on the occupier, however long it may\r\nlast. My Government has announced its intention of\r\nplacing the conflict with Iran before the International Court\r\nof Justice in order to arrive at a peaceful settlement of the\r\nquestion of the three islands. While reaffirming in advance\r\nour acceptance of whatever outcome may ensue from the\r\nCourt’s ruling in this matter, we call upon Iran to respond\r\nto our peaceful initiative. It is our belief — a belief\r\nshared by the international community — that that\r\ninitiative is the best means of reaching a just and final\r\npeaceful settlement to the dispute and ensuring peaceful\r\ncoexistence, security and stability in a region that has\r\nwitnessed many disputes and wars over the past 20 years.\r\nAgenda item 17\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs\r\nand other appointments\r\n(a) Appointment of members of the Advisory\r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions: report of the Fifth Committee\r\n(A/49/432)\r\nThe President: The Fifth Committee recommends\r\nin paragraph 4 of the report that the General Assembly\r\nshould appoint Mr. Yuji Kumamaru of Japan as a\r\nmember of the Advisory Committee on Administrative\r\nand Budgetary Questions for a term of office beginning\r\non 5 October 1994 and ending on 31 December 1995.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly appoints Mr. Yuji\r\nKumamaru as a member of the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions for a term of\r\noffice beginning on 5 October 1994 and ending on 31\r\nDecember 1995?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.\r\n35\r\n"
