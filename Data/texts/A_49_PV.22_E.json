(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. David Kpomakpor, Chairman of the\r\nCouncil of State of the Liberian National Transitional\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Liberia\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the Chairman of the\r\nCouncil of State of the Liberian National Transitional\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Liberia.\r\nMr. David Kpomakpor, Chairman of the Council of\r\nState of the Liberian National Transitional\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Liberia, was escorted\r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the Chairman of the Council\r\nof State of the Liberian National Transitional Government\r\nof the Republic of Liberia, His Excellency Professor David\r\nKpomakpor, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nChairman Kpomakpor: Mr. President, I wish to join\r\nothers who have spoken before me in congratulating you on\r\nyour election to guide the deliberations of the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. As you\r\nundertake this solemn and challenging responsibility we\r\nassure you of the Liberian delegation’s fullest cooperation\r\nand support.\r\nLet me also convey our gratitude to your erudite\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, for\r\nthe skilful manner in which he guided the deliberations of\r\nthe last session.\r\nOur able and distinguished Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, deserves special\r\ncommendation for his unwavering commitment to the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations and his untiring efforts\r\nin the promotion of world peace, international security\r\nand human dignity. We are particularly pleased at his\r\nkeen interest and involvement in the search for durable\r\npeace in Liberia.\r\nAs we approach the midpoint of the last decade in\r\nthis millennium we are encouraged that our world\r\ncontinues to make steady progress in the transition from\r\nyears of ideological confrontation to convergence on\r\nglobal interdependence.\r\nA manifestation of this changing situation is the\r\ngrowing utilization of a consensual approach to\r\naddressing such burning issues on the international agenda\r\nas human rights, population and the environment. In this\r\nregard we welcome the outcome of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development held at Cairo\r\nand look forward to the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, to be convened in Copenhagen, Denmark,\r\nin 1995, which will consider the core issues of alleviating\r\nand reducing poverty, expanding productive employment\r\nand enhancing social integration.\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nThe peaceful transition from apartheid to majority rule\r\nin South Africa has been of monumental significance to\r\nAfrica. We heartily welcome the new Republic of South\r\nAfrica into the fold of the world body and look forward to\r\nthe positive contributions it can and will surely make to the\r\nachievement of the noble goals of the United Nations.\r\nThese positive developments in the international\r\nsystem are, however, often overshadowed by flashpoints of\r\nethnic conflicts around the world. The situations in Bosnia,\r\nRwanda and Somalia, and in my own country, Liberia,\r\namong others, appear to be intractable. The brutality and\r\ndestruction unleashed by these conflicts often tend to\r\noverwhelm the international community and make peace-\r\nkeeping a major preoccupation of the United Nations and,\r\nto an increasing degree, of regional organizations as well.\r\nEconomic and human resources that could otherwise be\r\napplied to improving the human condition are being\r\nexpended on peace-keeping activities.\r\nSome of these intra-State conflicts are so complex that\r\npolicy makers are forced to debate the pros and cons of\r\npeace-keeping or peacemaking when the main issue should\r\nbe that of saving lives, especially in those situations where\r\na legitimate governing authority is absent.\r\nThe result is that the international community\r\nsometimes reacts with what may amount to short-cut\r\nsolutions. Often attempts at resolving some of these\r\nconflicts unwittingly overlook the intransigence and\r\nrecalcitrance of warlords who were the ones primarily\r\nresponsible for bringing untold suffering and deprivation to\r\ntheir own people. These conflicts also create lucrative\r\nopportunities for arms dealers and international supporters\r\nof warlords.\r\nA disturbing phenomenon associated with these\r\nconflicts is that of the child soldier. Children are recruited,\r\nindoctrinated and trained in the art of murder, mayhem and\r\ngenocide, thus depriving a country of an entire generation\r\nof its human resources. This is particularly true for my\r\nown country, Liberia, where the great majority of the\r\n60,000 combatants are children who have yet to complete\r\ntheir primary education. The forced conscription of our\r\nchildren — the building-blocks of our future — must be\r\nstopped, since it violates the Convention of the Rights of\r\nthe Child. Therefore we should not yield to any action that\r\nhas the effect of sanctioning the acquisition of power\r\nthrough the use of force or promoting solutions aimed at\r\nappeasing warlords at the expense of the larger unarmed\r\npopulation.\r\nThe world has witnessed the rise, during the last\r\nfour years, of a powerful movement for democracy and\r\ndemocratization. This movement has swept asunder some\r\nof the strongest totalitarian regimes in its wake, from\r\nEastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to Latin\r\nAmerica, Africa and Asia.\r\nThe international community must therefore\r\ndemonstrate its resolve to support this movement so that\r\nthe democratic aspirations of all peoples are realized\r\nthroughout the world. It would be an indictment of the\r\npresent world leadership for it to simply watch countries\r\nbecome involved in these conflicts, which may have been\r\nignited initially by the spark of democratization.\r\nIt is against this background that we wish to briefly\r\nreview the Liberian peace process.\r\nAt the outset, I should like to register the heartfelt\r\ngratitude of the Liberian people to the gallant men of\r\nECOMOG — the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) Military Observer Group — who\r\nfoiled the attempted coup on 15 September 1994. Since\r\n1990, their selfless sacrifice has provided a security\r\nblanket in parts of Liberia, thus enabling us to work\r\ntowards the attainment of peace in our country.\r\nIt will be recalled that in December 1989 the\r\nLiberian situation exploded into an armed conflict,\r\nostensibly to rid the country of military dictatorship. By\r\nmid-1990, however, the conflict had degenerated into a\r\nthree-way struggle for power. The State machinery had\r\ndisintegrated.\r\nNone of the armed factions engaged in the struggle\r\nappeared capable of winning a decisive victory and\r\nestablishing legitimate authority. In the wake of this\r\ndeadly stalemate, ECOWAS intervened with a two-\r\npronged peace plan: A peace-monitoring force would be\r\ndispatched to Liberia to provide security for the country,\r\nwhile the Liberians themselves would re-establish an\r\ninternal civil administration to prepare the country for\r\ndemocratic elections.\r\nThe ECOWAS peace-monitoring group, ECOMOG,\r\narrived in Liberia in August 1990. An All-Liberia\r\nConference was convened in Banjul, the Gambia, in the\r\nsame month, and elected the Interim Government of\r\nNational Unity (IGNU). Upon the insistence of the\r\nNational Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), a second, All-\r\nLiberia Conference was convened in Monrovia in 1991,\r\nwhich endorsed the Interim Government. Unfortunately,\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nthe NPFL, which insisted on the Conference as a\r\nprecondition for peace, walked out during the deliberations.\r\nSeveral other meetings of the warring factions were\r\nheld in Banjul, Freetown, Dakar, Bamako, Lomé,\r\nYamoussoukro and Geneva, in search of peace with the\r\narmed factions. With remarkable success, the ECOWAS\r\npeace plan, with an interim civilian administration for\r\nLiberia and with ECOMOG, restored some degree of\r\nstability and provided a semblance of law and order in the\r\ncountry for a period of two years.\r\nOn 15 October 1992, the NPFL launched an\r\nunprovoked attack on ECOMOG and the people of\r\nMonrovia in what was termed “Operation Octopus”. The\r\nrefusal of the NPFL to fully comply with the\r\nYamoussoukro Accord gave rise to a new armed group, the\r\nUnited Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy\r\n(ULIMO), which claimed its sole purpose was to free the\r\nLiberian people from the NPFL.\r\nWith hostilities raging among the armed factions, the\r\nUnited Nations, in concert with ECOWAS and the OAU,\r\ndecided to convene a peace conference of the parties to the\r\nconflict in Geneva in June 1993. The meeting was attended\r\nby the NPFL, ULIMO and IGNU. The IGNU delegation\r\nincluded the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL).\r\nThe United Nations Secretary-General’s Special\r\nRepresentative chaired the meeting, which was also\r\nattended by the OAU Eminent Person, the Executive\r\nSecretary of ECOWAS and the Field Commander of\r\nECOMOG.\r\nThe framework agreed upon in Geneva was formally\r\nconcluded and signed by the parties in Cotonou, Republic\r\nof Benin, on 25 July 1993. The overriding principle of the\r\nCotonou Agreement was to achieve disarmament and\r\ndemobilization of the warring factions, which agreed that\r\nthey would give up their arms in exchange for participating\r\nin the formation of a new government.\r\nThe Cotonou Agreement provided for the\r\nestablishment of the Liberian National Transitional\r\nGovernment, headed by a five-man Executive Council of\r\nState, a 35-member Transitional Legislative Assembly and\r\nthe reconstitution of the Supreme Court and the Ad Hoc\r\nElections Commission. Each of these organs was to be\r\ncomposed of nominees representing the parties to the\r\nAgreement. The Cabinet positions were apportioned in\r\nconsultation with the parties.\r\nThe Liberian National Transitional Government was\r\ngiven the mandate to extend its authority throughout the\r\ncountry, to repatriate and resettle refugees from abroad,\r\nand to conduct free and fair elections within six months.\r\nDisarmament was to be carried out concomitantly\r\nwith the seating of the Liberian National Transitional\r\nGovernment, and the armed factions agreed to cooperate\r\nwith the expanded ECOMOG to disarm under the\r\nsupervision of the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nLiberia.\r\nThe Liberian National Transitional Government was\r\ninducted into office on 7 March 1994, and the Special\r\nRepresentative of the United Nations Secretary-General\r\ngave assurances that disarmament would commence\r\nsimultaneously. He also assured the Liberian people that\r\nthe armed factions would comply fully with the\r\nprovisions of the Cotonou Agreement. After the seating\r\nof the Liberian National Transitional Government the\r\nmilitary aspects of the peace process did not keep pace\r\nwith the political aspects as contemplated by the\r\nAgreement. Moreover, it took six months for the\r\nadditional troops from Tanzania and Uganda to arrive in\r\nLiberia. The expanded ECOMOG troops were never\r\ndeployed and the factions did not disarm. They continue\r\nto believe in the attainment of political power by force of\r\narms or, more precisely, through the barrel of the gun.\r\nConsequently, there has been a mushrooming of\r\narmed groups. There are now two factions of ULIMO\r\nand two factions of NPFL. There is also the Liberian\r\nPeace Council (LPC) and the Lofa Defence Force (LDF).\r\nEach of the breakaway factions of ULIMO and the NPFL,\r\ntogether with the LPC and LDF, have joined in a\r\ncoalition of forces to fight the branch of NPFL led by Mr.\r\nCharles Taylor. As I speak, the battle in central Liberia\r\nrages on. A consequence of this situation is the mass\r\nexodus of frightened citizens who have had to seek refuge\r\nand havens in neighbouring countries and a heightening\r\nof the humanitarian needs of the country.\r\nI come now to the Liberian National Conference.\r\nRealizing the current morass in the country and the\r\nuncooperative attitude of the warring factions towards the\r\nLiberian National Transitional Government, a citizens’\r\nconsultative meeting was convened in Monrovia from 29\r\nto 30 July 1994. At that meeting the people of Liberia\r\ndetermined that for the last four years the destiny of the\r\ncountry had been largely dictated by the warring factions\r\nand that they, the citizens, were being marginalized.\r\nThey also concluded that the stalemate in the peace\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nprocess was the result of the intransigence of the warring\r\nfactions with respect to disarmament and their failure to\r\ncooperate with the Liberian National Transitional\r\nGovernment, ECOMOG and UNOMIL in carrying out their\r\nrespective responsibilities and duties under the Cotonou\r\nAgreement.\r\nThe people of Liberia therefore decided that they\r\nmust, and would, become involved in breaking the\r\nstalemate in the peace process. They have therefore\r\nconvened since 24 August 1994 the Liberian National\r\nConference (LNC), with representatives coming from all\r\nwalks of life, including the 13 political subdivisions of the\r\ncountry, political parties, interest groups, professional\r\norganizations, social and religious organizations, trade and\r\nlabour unions, student and youth groups and women’s\r\norganizations.\r\nThe Conference organizers endeavoured to involve and\r\nencourage the participation of the warring factions. The\r\nConference was addressed by the Special Representative of\r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Trevor Gordon-\r\nSomers; the former United States President, Jimmy Carter;\r\nand the OAU Eminent Person, the Rev. Dr. Canaan\r\nBanana. General Arnold Quainoo, ECOMOG’s first field\r\ncommander and Special Representative of the ECOWAS\r\nChairman, and the Executive Secretary of ECOWAS, Dr.\r\nEdouard Benjamin, also addressed the Conference and\r\nexpressed support for it.\r\nThe Conference agenda included disarmament and\r\ndemobilization, governance and elections. The consensus\r\nof the Conference was that the fundamental problem of the\r\nLiberian conflict is not governance, but, rather, the refusal\r\nof the armed groups to disarm and demobilize. The\r\nConference therefore called for strong and effective\r\nsanctions to be applied against armed groups and warring\r\nfactions which fail to cooperate in the disarmament process.\r\nWith respect to governance, the Conference indicated\r\nthat the mandate of the Liberian National Transitional\r\nGovernment should be extended and the Council of State\r\nstrengthened so as to take the country through to free and\r\nfair democratic elections. We also see the Liberian\r\nNational Conference as the embodiment of the democratic\r\naspirations of the Liberian people and their opposition to\r\nthe acquisition of power by force. Too much time, energy\r\nand resources and too many lives have been lost by\r\nLiberians and other West Africans to settle now for a less\r\nthan honourable, just and lasting solution.\r\nI turn next to the Akosombo Agreement. The\r\nLiberian National Conference had gained momentum and\r\nwas at the height of the debate on the fundamental\r\nproblems of disarmament, governance and elections, when\r\nHis Excellency, President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana,\r\nChairman of ECOWAS, along with the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, undertook new\r\ninitiatives to resolve the impasse in the peace process. A\r\nmeeting of leaders of two warring factions, Mr. Charles\r\nTaylor of the NPFL and Lieutenant-General Alhaji S.G.\r\nKromah, of ULIMO, together with the Chief of Staff of\r\nthe Armed Forces of Liberia, Lieutenant-General\r\nJ. Hezekiah Bowen, was held at Akosombo, Ghana. The\r\nOAU Eminent Person, Dr. Canaan Banana, also attended\r\nthe meeting. Except for General Bowen, the Liberian\r\nNational Transitional Government delegation was\r\nexcluded from the deliberations at Akosombo.\r\nOn 12 September 1994, General Bowen, Chief of\r\nStaff of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), without\r\nauthority signed the Akosombo Accord, along with the\r\ntwo warring leaders: Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah.\r\nThe Agreement did not adequately address the issue of\r\ndisarmament but instead called for the restructuring of the\r\nCouncil of State of the Liberian National Transitional\r\nGovernment (LNTG). The two armed factions would\r\neach nominate a representative; General Bowen —\r\nselected without consultation — would represent the AFL,\r\nthe constitutional army of Liberia; the ongoing Liberia\r\nNational Conference would nominate one civilian; and the\r\nNational Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and the United\r\nLiberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO)\r\nwould consult to nominate the fifth member of the\r\nCouncil. The restructured LNTG would have a life-span\r\nof 16 months, with general elections slated for October\r\n1995 and installation of the newly elected government in\r\nJanuary 1996. The LNTG delegation registered its\r\nreservations about the Agreement with the Ghanian\r\nGovernment before returning to Liberia.\r\nIn Liberia, the Akosombo Accord caused an outcry\r\nand widespread indignation. It was viewed as yet another\r\nattempt to appease the armed factional leaders whose\r\nuncompromising stance has been responsible for\r\nprolonging the conflict, causing the death of so many\r\nLiberians and bringing so much destruction and suffering\r\nupon the people.\r\nThe Government of Liberia has therefore rejected the\r\nAkosombo Accord for a number of reasons. First, the\r\nAccord endeavoured to reduce the armed forces of\r\nLiberia, the constitutional army, to a warring faction.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nSecondly, it failed to address adequately the political\r\nproblems — disarmament and demobilization of the\r\nwarring factions — that have been the single most\r\nimportant stumbling-block to the peace process. Thirdly,\r\nthe premises underpinning the Akosombo Accord were\r\nfundamentally flawed. It ascribed power and influence to\r\narmed leaders whose standing, credibility and control within\r\ntheir own respective factions are questionable. There was\r\nalso a failure to recognize the changing military positions\r\nof the factional leaders on the ground. For example, Mr.\r\nCharles Taylor of the NPFL has been unable to return to,\r\nor regain, his headquarters at Gbarnga since leaving the\r\nmeeting in Ghana, because his forces have been driven out\r\nby rival factions. A few days after General Hezekiah\r\nBowen returned from Ghana, there was an attempted coup\r\nand mutiny in his army ranks, and he had to seek refuge at\r\nthe headquarters of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) Military Observer Group\r\n(ECOMOG). General Alhaji Kromah’s ULIMO remains\r\nsplit.\r\nWe are pleased to note that as an indication of his\r\nsincerity and commitment towards finding a just and lasting\r\nsolution to the Liberian crisis, the President of Ghana and\r\ncurrent Chairman of ECOWAS, His Excellency Jerry\r\nRawlings, was quick to respond to the concerns raised by\r\nthe Liberian people to the Akosombo Accord. Within days\r\nof its signing, he dispatched a delegation to Liberia to hold\r\nconsultations on the Agreement. He has since convened a\r\nbroader-based consultative meeting in Accra. Consultations\r\non the Agreement continue in this regard.\r\nThe Liberian peace process is now at a critical stage.\r\nThe reaction to the Akosombo Accord and the renewed\r\noutbreak of hostilities in central Liberia among the armed\r\nfactions may lead some to conclude that Liberians are\r\nsimply not ready for peace, but this is not so. We are\r\nready for peace. We believe peace could finally be within\r\neasy reach, given the right mix of initiatives. Recent events\r\nin the country, including the failed coup attempt by\r\ndissident elements of the Armed Forces of Liberia and\r\nrenewed hostilities among the warring factions, reinforce\r\nthe need for effective action towards disarmament and\r\ndemobilization.\r\nI would be amiss if I did not say how grateful the\r\npeople of Liberia are to the United Nations, ECOWAS, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), non-governmental\r\norganizations, relief agencies and the entire international\r\ncommunity, who have made untold sacrifices and\r\ncontributed towards the search for peace in Liberia. In this\r\nlight, we wish to appeal to the world community to give\r\ngreater support to the work of ECOMOG by providing\r\nadditional logistics and resources to enable it effectively\r\nto execute its mandate under the Cotonou Agreement.\r\nHaiti provides a hopeful example of what can be\r\naccomplished when the international community stays the\r\ncourse in helping to find a peaceful solution to intra-State\r\nconflicts. Indeed, while the same set of variables that\r\ninfluenced tougher United Nations action in Haiti may not\r\nobtain in Liberia, the people of Liberia are crying out to\r\nthe world, especially to those countries that are better\r\nendowed and constantly hail the benefits of democracy,\r\nto take the high moral ground and lend their potent voices\r\nand wherewithal to ending the human misery and\r\nsuffering in Liberia.\r\nI am therefore confident that the United Nations,\r\nwhich has striven to implement the provisions of its\r\nCharter for about half a century, can still muster the\r\ncourage and will to respond to the requisites of peace,\r\ndemocracy and development for the truly global era that\r\nis dawning as we approach the twenty-first century.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nChairman of the Council of State of the Liberian National\r\nTransitional Government of the Republic of Liberia for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. David Kpomakpor, Chairman of the Council of\r\nState of the Liberian National Transitional\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Liberia, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9\r\nGeneral debate (continued)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nfirst speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Togo, His Excellency Mr. Boumbera\r\nAlassounouma.\r\nMr. Alassounouma (Togo) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): More than anyone else, Sir, you are aware of\r\nwhat excellent and solid relations of cooperation,\r\nfriendship and fraternity have existed for many years now\r\nbetween your country, Côte d’Ivoire, and Togo. It is thus\r\nwith great joy and enormous pride that my country\r\nwelcomes your unanimous election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nI therefore wish, on behalf of the Government of\r\nTogo, in the name of my delegation, and in my own\r\ncapacity, to congratulate you most sincerely on this tribute\r\nto you and to your fraternal country, Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nThe Togolese delegation and I myself assure you of\r\nour support. We are convinced that your competence and\r\nyour long experience in international affairs augur well for\r\nthe success of our work.\r\nI should like to take this occasion to congratulate your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, the\r\nPermanent Representative of Guyana, who, with\r\neffectiveness and tact, guided the proceedings of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. We extend\r\nour congratulations as well to the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, who has dedicated himself to the\r\nnoble ideals of this Organization to which we all belong.\r\nWe reiterate to him the total support of the delegation of\r\nTogo.\r\nSouth Africa has returned from a long voyage. We\r\nhave at last seen the death of apartheid. My country is\r\nproud to have contributed to reversing that odious system.\r\nTogo has always supported the legitimate aspirations of\r\npeoples oppressed the world over, but in particular the\r\naspirations of the black majority of South Africa, whose\r\nfundamental rights, even the most elementary among them,\r\nwere long trampled.\r\nIt is therefore with great joy that my country,\r\nrecognizing the courage, dedication and sacrifice of the\r\nSouth African nation, welcomes the return to the United\r\nNations of that fraternal country, which is now free and\r\ncommitted to waging — together with all the States\r\nMembers of this Organization — the necessary fight for\r\ndemocracy and for the total independence of other peoples.\r\nIn 1995, our Organization will celebrate its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. A new era of hope lies ahead for our nations.\r\nUnfortunately that era of hope also contains concerns,\r\ndisquiet at the increasing impoverishment of the poorest\r\ncountries, concern too about a world constantly devastated\r\nby conflicts and difficulties of all types. The period of\r\nupheaval in which we live presents our Organization with\r\na challenge — that of understanding all the major changes\r\nthat are under way and of finding rapid solutions to the\r\nmany problems confronting our planet.\r\nIt is therefore urgent to redefine the broad guidelines\r\nof the Organization on the basis of greater humanism on\r\nthe global level, so that man can again regain the strength\r\nto better exercise his freedom, to enjoy it fully, to respect\r\nthe laws of nature, and to break away from egoism and\r\nhard-heartedness. We must also lay new foundations for\r\ncooperation to help the United Nations not only to\r\neliminate the consequences of the cold war, but also to\r\nsolve the problems of today and those of tomorrow. This\r\nis the only way to respond to the expectations of our\r\npeoples and to respect the spirit of those who, 50 years\r\nago, created our world Organization, with the purpose,\r\namong other things, of preventing conflicts for the peace\r\nof nations and the well-being of peoples. The\r\nimplementation of the relevant recommendations\r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General, an\r\nAgenda for Peace, should, to this end, prompt us to focus\r\nour action, urgently, on preventive measures, to establish\r\nstable foundations for the harmonious development of\r\nsociety and to resolve its problems by developing flexible\r\nand appropriate mechanisms within the framework of the\r\nreforms now under way.\r\nThere are clear grounds for optimism when we see\r\nthat the adversaries of yesterday have become the allies\r\nof today, seeking together peaceful and mutually\r\nadvantageous solutions to the international problems of\r\nthe day. We therefore have all the more reason to have\r\nfaith in the future of our Organization. Planning for the\r\nfuture rather than waiting to be overtaken by events\r\nshould be the watchword of our nations.\r\nOn the internal level, my country has undertaken to\r\nembark on the path of democracy based on a complete\r\nand responsible multiparty system in order to establish a\r\nState based on law and on respect for the individual.\r\nFollowing the adoption of a new constitution in\r\nSeptember 1992, presidential and legislative elections\r\nwere held in August 1993 and in February 1994\r\nrespectively, leading to the establishment on 25 May last\r\nof a Government of national union whose programme of\r\naction aims basically at building a new Togo, democratic\r\nand free, at shaping national unity, at reconciling the\r\npeople with itself, at rallying this people around its\r\nnation, its values and its flag, in peace and regained\r\nharmony, and at rebuilding an economy damaged under\r\nthe combined effects of a range of factors both national\r\nand international.\r\nOf course, all of this cannot be accomplished in just\r\na few months; it takes time to overcome resentment, to\r\nreconcile the adversaries of the past, to establish the state\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nof law to which all aspire, to rebuild confidence and to lay\r\nthe foundations of a solid and prosperous economy.\r\nIn spite of the end of the cold war, we see disorder\r\nconstantly blurring the geopolitical landscape. The situation\r\nnow prevailing in Africa is hardly encouraging. The\r\ncontinent, marginalized, awakens only the minds of the\r\nmost attentive observers, when, across mountains and\r\nvalleys, they hear the cries of anguish and death. The cases\r\nof Rwanda, Angola, Liberia, Somalia and Mozambique\r\nsuffice to illustrate this bitter fact.\r\nMr. Seniloli (Fiji), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe defeat of the system of apartheid in South Africa\r\nand the tragic events in Rwanda illustrate the two extremes\r\nin the evolution of the African continent, characterized by\r\nthe contrast between hope and despair, progress and\r\ndestruction. While, at the present time, South Africa seems\r\nto represent hope, Rwanda, on the contrary, symbolizes the\r\nface of an Africa mutilated and ravaged.\r\nTogo appeals to the Government of Angola and to\r\nUNITA to show goodwill and the flexibility that is\r\nnecessary if a speedy and comprehensive settlement of the\r\nquestion is to be achieved in the framework of the Lusaka\r\ntalks.\r\nIn Liberia, despite a number of agreements, the\r\ndisarmament of the factions has not yet occurred, and the\r\ngeneral elections that it was hoped would take place seem\r\nto be becoming a mirage. Let us hope that good faith will\r\nfind its way into the hearts of the parties concerned so that\r\nthis fraternal country may regain the advantages of\r\nreconciliation and find again the path of development.\r\nAs for Somalia, Togo appeals to the international\r\ncommunity not to grow weary and leave that country. We\r\ntherefore invite the parties to the conflict to refrain from\r\ncontributing to discouragement and to resume real dialogue\r\naimed at the rapid establishment of reliable national\r\ninstitutions.\r\nIn respect of Western Sahara, my delegation supports\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on the question and urges all\r\nthe parties to cooperate fully with the United Nations to\r\nensure that the referendum on self-determination, to be held\r\nin February 1995 for the purpose of deciding the future of\r\nthe territory and its people, is organized effectively.\r\nThe Togolese Government is gratified at the recent\r\npositive development in the socio-political situation in\r\nBurundi and invites the new leaders to do all in their\r\npower to secure the definitive restoration of peace in that\r\ncountry.\r\nTogo supports unreservedly the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General and of the Security Council to bring\r\npeace to Mozambique. It invites the parties to commit\r\nthemselves totally to accepting and respecting the results\r\nof the forthcoming general elections.\r\nFaced with this situation of armed conflict, tension\r\nand insecurity, Africa must shoulder its responsibilities.\r\nIt is through its own efforts that the African continent will\r\nbe able to overcome the difficulties it faces today. This\r\nis the sense of the proposal that General Gnassinmgbé\r\nEyadema, President of the Republic of Togo, made to the\r\nTunis Summit of the Organization of African Unity in\r\nJune 1994, when he advocated the creation of an African\r\npeace force whose mission would be to ensure peace\r\nwhere it is threatened by acting as a buffer between the\r\nbelligerents and making possible a negotiated solution to\r\nconflicts. The delegation of Togo is delighted that this\r\nidea aroused a great deal of interest on the part of certain\r\nlarge Powers that are prepared to provide logistical\r\nsupport for such a buffer force.\r\nThe unprecedented positive development of the\r\npeace process in the Middle East, reflected over the past\r\n12 months in the Israeli-Palestinian accord of September\r\n1993 and in the historic Washington D.C. meeting of\r\n25 July 1994 between His Majesty King Hussein of the\r\nHashimite Kingdom of Jordan and Prime Minister\r\nYitzhak Rabin of Israel, opens up before us a horizon of\r\nhope. These encouraging developments are important\r\nsteps in the direction of peace. They demonstrate clearly\r\nthat disputes can be settled effectively only through\r\npeaceful means and that only resolute political will can\r\nhelp to build a peaceful society.\r\nIn total agreement with the initiators of and the\r\nprotagonists at these gatherings, my country asks the\r\nUnited Nations, all Governments of the region and\r\nespecially the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to continue\r\nthe negotiations with a view to the establishment of a\r\nglobal, definitive and lasting peace in that part of the\r\nworld to enable all States concerned with the Arab-Israeli\r\nconflict to live henceforth within secure borders\r\nrecognized by all, on the basis of mutual respect for the\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence\r\nof States.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nAs regards the future of the Palestinian people, the\r\ntransition period, which is just beginning, must be\r\nsustained, not only politically but also, and above all,\r\nthrough financial, economic and technical assistance from\r\nthe international community. The United Nations will\r\ntherefore have to assume its responsibilities fully until the\r\nPalestinian question is definitively and satisfactorily\r\nresolved in all its aspects.\r\nIn the eastern part of Europe the situation is still\r\nconstantly characterized by violence and by an explosion of\r\nnationalism. States have been dislocated, borders have\r\nbeen called into question, and dreams of annexation and of\r\n“ethnic cleansing” inspire and haunt both minds and hearts.\r\nDrawing lessons, as is imperative, from all these\r\ntragedies and conflicts, the United Nations must promote\r\nand encourage further the use by States of the principle of\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes. Of course, the\r\nOrganization has in recent years clearly demonstrated its\r\nusefulness, especially in the fields of humanitarian affairs\r\nand the maintenance of peace. But sometimes lack of will\r\nto act promptly paralyses its action. This paralysis reveals\r\nprofound shortcomings in the system of collective security\r\nprovided for in the Charter and is due, above all, to the\r\nrefusal of many Member States to commit themselves to\r\npeace, despite the special responsibilities entrusted to them\r\nby the Charter.\r\nThis being the case, it is clear that, as it makes\r\ndecisions about the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, the Security Council should be broadened and,\r\nthereby, adapted to the changes in the world of today.\r\nTogo believes that the United Nations is the most\r\nappropriate forum for the creation of a new international\r\norder and the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, as well as for the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nThat is why we support its actions. We demonstrated this,\r\ninter alia, in the framework of peace-keeping operations by\r\nsending military contingents and police officers to Rwanda,\r\nWestern Sahara and Mozambique to serve under the flag of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nProfoundly committed to peace and to the principle of\r\ngeneral and complete disarmament, Togo rejoices in the\r\nmany positive developments that have taken place in this\r\nfield over recent months. But we remain concerned at the\r\nconstantly increasing proliferation of conventional weapons.\r\nThe massive international transfers of such weapons\r\ndangerously compromise the success of effective general\r\ndisarmament. It has become urgent to strengthen the role\r\nand the capacity for action of the United Nations regional\r\ncentres for peace and disarmament, which are at present\r\npoorly structured and lack both the material and the\r\nhuman resources they need to function properly and\r\nproduce the results the international community expects\r\nof them.\r\nThe particularly alarming case of the United Nations\r\nRegional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, of\r\nwhich my country is honoured to be the headquarters, is\r\nquite illustrative, and should be examined with care. For,\r\nparadoxically, while the African continent is prey to\r\nviolent and constant civil wars, which endanger regional\r\nand international peace and security, the Centre, which\r\nthe United Nations could well have used to contribute to\r\nthe quest for appropriate solutions to these conflicts, is,\r\neither by design or by circumstance, left out and its\r\nexistence is almost ignored.\r\nAs regards the nuclear problem on the Korean\r\npeninsula, my delegation welcomes the agreement\r\nrecently reached between the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States of America. It\r\nalso welcomes the readiness expressed by the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea to comply with the provisions\r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons. Togo views this courageous position adopted\r\nby the North Korean party as edifying testimony of its\r\ndetermination to maintain peace in the region.\r\nThe world economy continues to be characterized by\r\ntrends toward stagnation and the growing disparity\r\nbetween North and South.\r\nAs we prepare to enter the third millennium, the\r\nelimination of poverty should be one of the main\r\nobjectives of our Organization. In this context, the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, which the Government\r\nof Denmark has offered to host in March 1995 in\r\nCopenhagen, assumes its full importance. Togo fervently\r\nhopes that Member States will demonstrate political will\r\nand, in a surge of collective responsibility, give this\r\nSummit the attention necessary to obtain concrete results\r\nand practical decisions whose implementation should lead\r\nto the true elimination of poverty, the creation of\r\ngenuinely productive jobs and the complete integration of\r\nmarginalized or excluded sectors of society.\r\nDuring the last 15 years, there have been many\r\nobstacles to growth in our countries, including the decline\r\nin foreign capital, the debt crisis, and the constant decline\r\nin public development assistance, whose level is clearly\r\nshort of the target 0.7 per cent of gross national product\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nthat was set and strongly recommended by the United\r\nNations. All of this leads to widespread poverty,\r\naggravated by structural adjustment programmes that have\r\ninsupportable social effects.\r\nThere has been constant regression in Africa’s share\r\nof world trade. The recent Marrakesh agreements that\r\nresulted from long and difficult international negotiations in\r\nthe Uruguay Round, far from meeting the expectations of\r\nthe developing countries in general and of Africa in\r\nparticular, are likely to lead to new imbalances in\r\ninternational trade which may require more than a decade\r\nto redress.\r\nIn this respect, my delegation views the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment proposed to us by the Secretary-General as a\r\ntimely initiative, offering as it does an opportunity to begin\r\na process of constructive dialogue and political mobilization\r\nto create a true and just partnership that can engage in\r\nbetter consideration of development issues.\r\nTogether with the Group of 77 and China, Togo\r\nstrongly supports the idea that this Agenda should build an\r\ninternational consensus for the global liberalization of trade,\r\non the one hand as an effective means for international\r\ncooperation for development, and on the other to give new\r\nimpetus to the efforts made over the last decade to avoid\r\nprotectionist policies.\r\nIf the transition of the General Agreement on Tariffs\r\nand Trade into the World Trade Organization is to be\r\nsmooth, there must be a mechanism that can compensate\r\nthe developing countries affected by the new system.\r\nAlong these lines, the implementation of the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s,\r\nadopted by the General Assembly in 1991, and the\r\nimplementation of the Paris Declaration and the Programme\r\nof Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s,\r\nadopted in 1990, should, in our opinion, be geared to an\r\nincrease in the volume of official development assistance,\r\nthe promotion of respect for commitments that have been\r\nundertaken for new and additional resources\r\nfor international cooperation, and a greater lightening of the\r\ndebt burden, or even its cancellation. It would be desirable\r\nto adopt policies that ensured an adequate flow\r\nof concessional financing to the developing countries, in\r\nparticular to the least developed among them; stimulated\r\nother flows of capital, including direct investment; reversed\r\nthe negative trend in financial\r\nflows, and created mechanisms and allocated resources\r\nrelated to development.\r\nIt can never be overemphasized that sustainable\r\ndevelopment is a prerequisite to lasting peace. The right\r\nto development must be considered, henceforth, as a\r\nfundamental human right, and thus be given priority\r\nattention by the international community. Along these\r\nlines, my Government hopes that, in addition to the\r\nresults of the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, held in Cairo from 5 to 13 September last,\r\nthe work of the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nof the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held in\r\nBeijing in September 1995, and of the Second United\r\nNations Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT\r\nII), to be held in Istanbul from 3 to 14 June 1996, will\r\nhelp produce at the international level a spirit of shared\r\nresponsibility and the necessary political will to mobilize\r\nthe resources that are indispensable if our developing\r\ncountries are to thrive.\r\nAgenda 21 and the Rio Declaration are an important\r\nbridge on the road to sustainable development and to the\r\nprotection of the Earth from the dangers facing it. That\r\nis why, two years ago, all the participants in the\r\nConference showed such enthusiasm and sincerity.\r\nRegrettably, the results of that historic summit have still\r\nnot been reflected in concrete facts. No notable progress\r\nhas yet been observed in the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained, in particular, in the\r\nProgramme of Action. It is high time that States and the\r\ninternational community did everything in their power, at\r\nthe national, regional and international levels, to put into\r\neffect the commitments to sustainable development\r\nundertaken in Rio.\r\nThe Togolese Government welcomes the entry into\r\nforce of the Framework Convention on Climate Change\r\nand is particularly delighted at the conclusion of another\r\nlegal instrument of global scope: the International\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Countries\r\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\r\nParticularly in Africa. The Convention was adopted by\r\nthe intergovernmental negotiating Committee in Paris in\r\nJune 1994. Togo was pleased to take part in the\r\nnegotiating process and will soon take up the procedures\r\nfor signature and ratification. We invite all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations to do likewise in order\r\nthat the Convention and related instruments may enter\r\ninto force as soon as possible.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nConsidering the uncertain future of mankind and the\r\nnumerous and formidable challenges confronting the human\r\nrace, it is imperative that we become clearly aware of our\r\nmoral obligations. As of this moment it is essential to\r\nidentify and correct the weaknesses and failings of our\r\nOrganization. The reforms under way are indispensable,\r\nbut they must not become a means of conferring even\r\ngreater influence than in the past on the large countries and\r\nrichest Powers in the world. Our new awareness must also\r\nhelp define ways of establishing relations among nations in\r\nthe future, and in dealing with our present-day concerns we\r\nmust take into account the causes of the disparities in\r\nstandards of living between North and South. There is no\r\neffect without a cause, and to deny the principle of\r\ncausality amounts to deferring our problems and never\r\nsolving them.\r\nOnly an attitude based on action, justice and\r\ninternational solidarity can spare the world a conflict that\r\nwould otherwise, sooner or later, be inevitable. Thus,\r\ntackling the deep-rooted causes of today’s problems means\r\nseeking together the solutions that will make it possible for\r\nmen, women and children to live decently and in complete\r\nfreedom, without fear of being crushed by unemployment,\r\npoverty and hunger. This would also make it possible to\r\nprotect the dignity of the human person and to safeguard\r\nhuman security.\r\nTomorrow we should have a world in which all\r\nnations and all citizens refuse to listen to the voice of their\r\nown personal interests when they run counter to the\r\ncommon weal, a world in which nations and peoples find\r\nsatisfaction not only in that which is to their own advantage\r\nbut also in that which is to everyone’s advantage.\r\nAt its forty-ninth session, may the General Assembly,\r\nunder the leadership of its President, contribute to dispelling\r\nour concerns and to defining the ways and means of\r\nhelping us blaze the way into the future. This is my\r\ndelegation’s most fervent hope.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Jamaica, His\r\nExcellency the Honourable Paul Robertson.\r\nMr. Robertson (Jamaica): May I, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Jamaica, convey warmest\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Amara Essy on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.\r\nI wish to assure him of the full support and cooperation of\r\nthe Jamaican delegation in the deliberations on the many\r\nimportant issues before the Assembly.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nAmbassador Insanally of Guyana on the skilful and\r\ninnovative manner in which he presided over the forty-\r\neighth session. We in the Caribbean are justifiably proud\r\nof his contributions to the Assembly’s deliberations.\r\nLast year I emphasized that the international\r\ncommunity was at a crossroads where we were faced not\r\nonly with matters of economic progress but also with an\r\nenvironment full of conflicts and strife. My outlook was,\r\nand still is, one of optimism, an optimism rooted in the\r\nrecognition that the old political and military order has\r\npassed and that history has, for the second time in less\r\nthan two generations, provided us with the opportunity to\r\nembark on a process of international consensus-building.\r\nThis is an exciting and daunting task, particularly for a\r\nsmall island State like Jamaica, whose faith and\r\ncommitment to multilateralism and the United Nations\r\nremain unwavering.\r\nOur most pressing collective challenge is to make\r\nthis Organization a more effective instrument for peace\r\nand development. The United Nations is being called\r\nupon to respond to a host of new challenges, including\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance, peace-keeping,\r\npeacemaking, development and post-conflict rebuilding.\r\nThe past year has seen human misery and dislocation of\r\nfearful proportions in Haiti, on the high seas of the\r\nCaribbean, in Rwanda, in the refugee camps of Zaire and\r\nTanzania, in Bosnia and in Afghanistan. Their underlying\r\ncauses are political, social and economic. The United\r\nNations can and should bring to these and other situations\r\na broadly encompassing view of the indivisibility of\r\npolitical, economic and social processes.\r\nThe Organization and its resources and the will and\r\nvision of its Members must be mobilized to address the\r\nimperatives of social and economic development. We\r\nmust seek to promote a new era of international\r\ncooperation for global human security.\r\nThe global nature of this challenge is inescapable.\r\nIt has become evident that no State by itself can control\r\nthe spread of environmental degradation and pollution,\r\ntransnational migrations and diseases such the AIDS\r\nepidemic. Economic globalization and the accompanying\r\nliberalization of trade and financial flows, now link\r\ndeveloped and developing economies, North and South,\r\nEast and West. Global solutions and coordinated\r\nstrategies must consequently form the basis of our\r\nactions.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nGlobalization brings new opportunities, but it also\r\nbrings new dangers. Despite the general trend towards\r\nimproved economic management, economic disparities are\r\nwidening. Developing countries are being marginalized\r\nfrom the growth trends in the international economy. This\r\nis a matter of concern to Jamaica as we, like a large\r\nnumber of other developing countries, have placed high\r\ndevelopmental priority on export-led growth and on\r\nattracting investment flows. Structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes have also been undertaken at great social cost.\r\nThe contributions of the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies in areas such as institution-building, poverty\r\nalleviation, productivity enhancement, small enterprise\r\ndevelopment and financing, and the strengthening of human\r\nresources, continue to be vital elements in enhancing the\r\nproductive potential of developing countries. This will, in\r\nturn, enable our countries to benefit more fully from and to\r\nparticipate more effectively in a liberal and increasingly\r\norganic global economy.\r\nThe United Nations must now work vigorously\r\ntowards the implementation of an agenda for development.\r\nA meaningful agenda for development must set priorities in\r\nprogrammes and resources that respond to the challenges\r\nposed by the international environment for developing\r\ncountries. These priorities must address all issues to which\r\nadequate multilateral solutions have yet to be found. These\r\ninclude the burden of debt; inadequate flows of official\r\ndevelopment assistance; the debilitating brain drain; the\r\nreverse transfer of resources to multilateral financial\r\ninstitutions; the social costs of structural adjustment and the\r\nnon-transparent trade barriers and protectionist measures\r\nthat remain in place in industrialized countries against the\r\nproducts of developing countries even as the general trend\r\ntowards liberalization and trade in goods and services is\r\naccelerating. The agenda must strengthen the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the area of international economic policy-\r\nmaking and coordination. It must seek to enhance the\r\nrelationship of the United Nations with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the International Monetary Fund and the\r\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the\r\ntwo Bretton Woods institutions established under the\r\numbrella of the United Nations. I wish to emphasize that\r\nwe should continue to examine the roles and policies of\r\nthese institutions. We must make the changes that five\r\ndecades of experience indicate are necessary so as to\r\nimprove the prospects for growth and development of\r\ndeveloping countries — change which can be carried out\r\nwithout undermining the health and vitality of the\r\ninternational economy or the fiscal integrity of these\r\ninstitutions. Major developed countries should re-examine\r\ntheir opposition to the sound proposals for change that\r\nhave been put forward repeatedly by developing\r\ncountries — proposals that range from increasing\r\ninternational liquidity to longer adjustment periods. Over\r\nthe years, the International Monetary Fund has moved\r\nfrom the supervision of a fixed exchange rate system to\r\nassisting developing countries through financial crises,\r\nwhile the World Bank has made the transition from post-\r\nwar reconstruction to funding development in the third\r\nworld. Now is an opportune time to reassess their\r\nrespective roles, given new global dynamics and changing\r\npatterns of trade and investment. The Fund and the Bank\r\nneed to quickly adapt to the current global economic\r\nsystem if they are to remain relevant to contemporary\r\nrealities.\r\nTwo important conferences were held this year\r\nwhich offered opportunities for international attention and\r\naction. In Barbados, the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates adopted a programme of action which now requires\r\nthe support and assistance of the United Nations system\r\nand the donor community for its speedy and effective\r\nimplementation. The recently concluded International\r\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo\r\nproduced a landmark document highlighting the\r\ninextricable linkage between population, sustained\r\neconomic growth and sustained development. Next year\r\nin Copenhagen, the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment will endeavour to adopt a global approach\r\nto the eradication of poverty, the generation of productive\r\nemployment and the enhancement of social integration.\r\nWe will also meet in Beijing at the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women to continue to put in place\r\nmeasures which will create an enabling environment for\r\nwomen. Jamaica will actively participate in these\r\nimportant processes.\r\nI have chosen to focus at the outset on what Jamaica\r\nsees as the development imperative and priorities of the\r\nUnited Nations because we are convinced that the path to\r\ndevelopment and the path to peace are one and the same.\r\nJamaica fully supports an open, non-discriminatory\r\ntrading system governed by transparent rules and with an\r\neffective mechanism for settling disputes. We therefore\r\nawait the implementation of the conclusions of the\r\nUruguay Round and the establishment of the World Trade\r\nOrganization. We will work actively within the new\r\norganization to ensure the promotion of development\r\nthrough trade, placing special importance on those\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nprovisions in the conclusions of the Uruguay Round which\r\nseek to ensure a regime of fairness and equity in the overall\r\ncontext of a programme of free trade.\r\nThe international community and its institutions are\r\ndynamic. The choice is whether we actively shape the\r\nchange that inevitably comes with the passing of time and\r\nwith new circumstances, or whether we merely react to\r\nevents. The World Trade Organization is an example of\r\npurposeful design by the international community. Yet\r\nanother — a truly historic one — is the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. As is widely known,\r\nthe Convention, which establishes a regulatory mechanism\r\nfor the oceans, the seas and their resources, will enter into\r\nforce on 16 November of this year. The inaugural meeting\r\nof the International Seabed Authority will be held in\r\nKingston on that date. This will be both an end and a\r\nbeginning. The event will mark the end of a process that\r\nbegan nearly twenty years ago and the opening of a new\r\nand historic chapter in international juridical and economic\r\nrelations.\r\nThe inaugural meeting will see the establishment of\r\nthe International Seabed Authority. We are extremely\r\nproud that Jamaica will host this important organization,\r\nwhich has responsibility for regulating and exploiting the\r\nworld’s vastest resource base. It must be emphasized,\r\nhowever, that the success of the Authority will require the\r\ncooperation of all parties concerned, in order to ensure that\r\nthe goal of universality is achieved. It is important that the\r\nAuthority receive the necessary resources to enable it to\r\noperate effectively, in a way consistent with principles and\r\npractices applied to institutions within the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nI wish again to pay tribute to those who have\r\ncontributed to the United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea, to its ratification and to the establishment of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority.\r\nWe invite all States to join in the momentous first\r\nmeeting of the Authority in Kingston from 16 to 18\r\nNovember. We look forward to welcoming the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of this Organization, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, who has graciously accepted the invitation\r\nof the Government of Jamaica to be at the inaugural\r\nmeeting.\r\nSince I spoke to this body last year, the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa has resumed its seat in the General Assembly.\r\nThe installation of a majority government in that country,\r\nunder the leadership of President Nelson Mandela, is a\r\nhistoric development of which the entire international\r\ncommunity is justifiably proud. The dismantling of\r\napartheid was a consequence of the long and valiant\r\nstruggle waged by the South African people. It was also\r\na victory for multilateralism and an important reminder of\r\nthe critical role that multilateral organizations such as the\r\nUnited Nations can play in resolving difficult international\r\nissues. The Government and the people of Jamaica\r\nwelcome a non-racial, democratic South Africa into the\r\ninternational community of nations.\r\nIn our own region, the situation in Haiti has been of\r\ngreat concern to Jamaica and our Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) partners. The wanton abuse of human\r\nrights that led to the death of Haitians within Haiti and of\r\nmany of those who fled in unsafe vessels simply had to\r\nstop.\r\nWe welcome the most recent developments in Haiti\r\nand the reaffirmation by the international community of\r\nits commitment to the Governors Island Accord. There\r\ncan be no deviation from the critical elements to which\r\nwe subscribed. The recent Security Council resolution\r\nsends a strong signal to the military authorities that the\r\ninternational community will accept no less than the\r\nprompt return of the legitimately elected President, the\r\nrestoration of the constitutional authority of the\r\nGovernment of Haiti, the reform of the army and the\r\npolice force, and the building of lasting democratic\r\ninstitutions. Jamaica, along with several of our\r\nCARICOM partners, is playing its part in this process by\r\nparticipating in the multinational force and in the United\r\nNations Mission in Haiti.\r\nDevelopments in Haiti have underscored the wisdom\r\nof the philosophy of the countries of the Caribbean that\r\nmaintaining peace and stability, within the context of\r\ndemocratic institutions and practices, must be the\r\nfundamental basis for the development of our region.\r\nWithin the wider Latin American and Caribbean region,\r\nwe are actively strengthening and widening cooperation\r\namong our countries. The establishment of the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States (ACS) in July of this\r\nyear was a historic development that provides for even\r\nstronger collaboration and cooperation.\r\nWe hope that in the interest of the entire region, a\r\nprocess of sustained dialogue and accommodation\r\nbetween Cuba and the United States can be initiated, and\r\nthat this will lead to conditions that permit the eventual\r\nfull reintegration of Cuba into the region and into the\r\nhemispheric community. Jamaica welcomes the call\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nmade by the Rio Group at its recent Eighth Summit\r\nmeeting for the lifting of the trade embargo against Cuba.\r\nThe trade and economic prospects of countries in the\r\nregion can be strengthened only by the priority now being\r\naccorded to regional and hemispheric relations and by the\r\ngrowing role, actual wand envisioned, for regional and\r\nsubregional organizations, such as CARICOM and the\r\nnewly established ACS, as well as by arrangements such as\r\nthe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In\r\nthe case of NAFTA, which we support strongly, Jamaica\r\nand other participants in the Caribbean Basin Initiative\r\n(CBI) programme continue to press for the adoption, by the\r\nUnited States Congress of the Interim Trade programme,\r\nwhich would significantly offset adverse consequences on\r\nexisting conditions of access under the CBI.\r\nI feel compelled to return in these final comments to\r\nthe mission of this Organization — peace and development.\r\nThere can be little cause for comfort when, since 1945, 20\r\nmillion people have died in wars and other conflicts. It is\r\ndisturbing and instructive to learn that some 80 million\r\npersons now live in foreign lands, and that a million\r\npersons immigrate permanently each year, while another\r\nmillion seek political asylum as they flee both poverty and\r\ninternal strife. The increasing flows of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons worldwide threaten peace and stability\r\nand exacerbate tensions and conflicts between countries and\r\nin entire regions. We must strengthen international\r\ncooperation in this area and streamline national and\r\ninternational procedures for dealing with this grave\r\nproblem.\r\nTo be true to its mission, the United Nations must be\r\nan Organization that reduces both want and war. This is\r\nwhy I underscored earlier my delegation’s strong belief that\r\nthis Organization must become increasingly active in the\r\npromotion of long-term development, which is the\r\nnecessary underpinning of a genuine and lasting peace.\r\nThe United Nations must not shrink from this aspect of its\r\nmission.\r\nThe military and ideological realignment of recent\r\nyears has created new opportunities for peace. But these\r\nunprecedented developments must be supported by\r\ninstitutional reforms and by new approaches on our part.\r\nThese institutional reforms must inevitably include the\r\nreform of the Security Council, the principal organ charged\r\nwith the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIn this regard, Jamaica fully supports the call for its\r\nenlargement. We believe that the Security Council must be\r\ntruly representative in order to be fully effective.\r\nExpenditure on armaments continues to consume\r\nresources and to divert spending away from human\r\ndevelopment needs in both developed and developing\r\ncountries. Military downsizing, particularly by\r\ndeveloping countries, has yet to gather the momentum\r\nthat was expected at the end of the cold war. The United\r\nNations has a legitimate role to play in providing\r\ntechnical and other assistance to help developing and\r\nother countries shift human and material resources from\r\nmilitary to civilian use. We note that the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council are also the world’s\r\nleading exporters of conventional weapons. This is an\r\nissue that should be addressed both in terms of reducing\r\narms exports, as well as in terms of converting the\r\nresources to the requirements of peace and development.\r\nIt would be remiss of me if I concluded my\r\ncontribution to this debate without referring to the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, to be celebrated next\r\nyear. As we all prepare for this historic occasion, we\r\nmust reflect on the fact that this achievement is in itself\r\na vindication of the principles on which the Organization\r\nwas founded. If we are to survive beyond that milestone\r\nwe must remain steadfast to these principles.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign and Political Affairs of the Republic of San\r\nMarino, His Excellency Mr. Gabriele Gatti.\r\nMr. Gatti (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): I wonder how historians\r\nwill judge the last decade of this century, and what future\r\ngenerations will read about these years. My opinion is\r\nthat we are experiencing an exciting period of arduous\r\nchallenges and great expectations for peace.\r\nThe installation of the administration of the\r\nPalestinian National Authority in Jericho gave us strong\r\nhope for a peaceful future.\r\nThe excessive crises and wars that have recently and\r\nsuddenly broken out and the revival and intensification of\r\nold ones in too many parts of our planet call for the\r\ninvolvement and intervention of the international\r\ncommunity. Let me also stress that not only should such\r\nintervention be firm, but it should also be legitimate and\r\ncorrect. In the effort to restore peace, the international\r\ncommunity should act fairly, respecting the legitimate\r\nreasons and opposing the illegitimate ones, with all due\r\nregard for man and human dignity.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nFrom the top of our Mount Titano, on a clear day, one\r\ncan see the coast of the former Yugoslavia. In the fourth\r\ncentury, San Marino’s founder fled from that coast to\r\nescape religious persecution.\r\nNow, in this forum, on behalf of the people of San\r\nMarino, I launch an appeal for peace for those tormented\r\nregions, for Sarajevo, and for the recognition of the equal\r\nrights of all human beings, without distinction of any kind,\r\nas well as for the dignity of those deprived of their right to\r\nlife.\r\nThe public response to the important Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, which brought representatives\r\nof many countries to Cairo in an effort to solve some of the\r\nproblems hindering the fair and balanced development of all\r\npeoples, has now faded away. The decisions taken during\r\nthat Conference, whose aims have been distorted and\r\nmisinterpreted, are only a small step forward. However, it\r\nis encouraging to see how it has been generally recognized\r\nthat our common concerns cannot and must not lie only in\r\na necessary reduction of rapid population growth. All the\r\nproblems related to this issue must be addressed, thus\r\nensuring all people’s rights to existence, to good health and\r\nfree development, and the disposal of their resources as\r\nthey see fit.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino participated in the\r\nConference, which was held in Egypt, prompted by the\r\nconviction that it was its duty to offer a contribution. My\r\nfellow citizens are well aware that a small country like ours\r\nwill never be in a position to play a substantial role in the\r\nchoices to be made and the decisions to be taken.\r\nNevertheless, our foreign policy is clear, and reflects our\r\ndeep-rooted historical traditions.\r\nMr. Vilchez Asher (Nicaragua), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn line with the policy adopted, we feel compelled to\r\ncall for respect for human rights and dignity. The latter\r\nimplies the right to make free choices, the right to\r\ndevelopment, to democratic progress, equality, equal\r\nopportunities, and the right to live in peace.\r\nIt seems that the United Nations has given to the\r\nCairo, Copenhagen and Beijing conferences the task of\r\noutlining a feasible solution to all the problems related to\r\nsocial development and the status of women.\r\nIt is clear that in declaring 1994 the International Year\r\nof the Family the General Assembly made a precise and\r\nwell-considered choice. By this decision the Assembly’s\r\naim was to celebrate an essential part of society, in the\r\nconviction that the family, the smallest democracy at the\r\ncentre of society, is the first and most important element\r\nof any country’s structure and deserves special attention\r\nby all States. In a national and international context\r\ncharacterized by a disquieting crisis of values, by\r\nincreasing economic and social difficulties and by a\r\ngrowing lack of models for young people, the family,\r\nwith its various historical, cultural and religious\r\ncomponents, represents the last hope for mankind.\r\nAgainst this background, all Governments have the\r\nprimary task of formulating policies capable of helping\r\nand supporting the family and its components while\r\nrespecting its autonomy and specific features. The\r\nRepublic of San Marino considers all family issues to be\r\nof the utmost importance, and it has recently taken new\r\nmeasures for the protection of motherhood and\r\nfatherhood, in addition to the laws already in force. The\r\nwidespread development we all hope to achieve has its\r\nroots in the family, in respect for it and within it, and\r\nmeans in practice gender equality and equal dignity\r\nbetween men and women.\r\nOn the other hand, development and its equitable\r\ndistribution can be obtained only if our projects include\r\nthe safeguarding of the environment. It is a notorious\r\nfact that too often protection of the natural environment\r\nis sacrificed for economic and national reasons that\r\ndamage the interests of other people and the common\r\nwell-being. The richest and most industrialized countries\r\nare regularly destroying the natural environment inside\r\nand outside their borders.\r\nTherefore, we deemed it necessary and fair to\r\ninclude the environment, along with peace, economic\r\ngrowth, social justice and democracy, as items on the\r\nAgenda for Development — the project proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General for the solution of the problems that\r\nwill face our planet within the next century.\r\nIn my country especially, where the protection of the\r\nterritory is of basic importance because of its small size,\r\npublic opinion in general and young people in particular\r\nare extremely sensitive to environmental issues and ask\r\nthat choices be made that respect the interests of the\r\ncommunity and the individual in a spirit of true solidarity.\r\nIn San Marino we have created the Foundation for the\r\nEnvironment, with very ambitious programmes, and we\r\nhope in the future to have the cooperation and support of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nWe all share the opinion that economic development\r\ngoes hand in hand with social development. Therefore, it\r\nis high time for all States to adopt appropriate social\r\npolicies and develop structures in support of the poorest and\r\nweakest groups of the population. Unfortunately,\r\nunemployment, poverty, the absence of economic security\r\nfor the elderly, and exploitation of labour are still a very\r\nsad, indeed tragic, reality.\r\nMy appeal to the world for solidarity is not just\r\nrhetorical. Solidarity is not only spiritual sharing but also,\r\nand above all, the substantial support offered by the rich\r\ncountries to the poor ones, the solidarity of the upper\r\nclasses with the lower classes, and even distribution of\r\nwelfare, equal rights and opportunities. Solidarity not only\r\nmeans substantial aid but also implies tolerance, a noble\r\nfeeling but one that is hard to achieve.\r\nWe are still witnessing with amazement shameful anti-\r\nSemitic, xenophobic and racist attitudes, showing that a\r\nculture of tolerance, dialogue and respect has still to be\r\ndeveloped at all levels. The concept seems to me to be\r\nvery simple: all men are equal and no one can claim to be\r\nsuperior. However, respect for others seems to be difficult\r\nto achieve, since it cannot be imposed by law or by a\r\nGovernment decision. This ambitious goal can be attained\r\nonly through an educational process even if a long-lasting\r\none — that involves future generations and calls upon\r\nnational and supranational institutions to carry out their own\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nThe United Nations is surely in a position to meet\r\nthese challenges and to offer the right and appropriate\r\nsolutions to the States. The role played by the United\r\nNations as it approaches its fiftieth anniversary — an event\r\nwe are about to celebrate — confirms all that.\r\nInternational peace and security, the solution of many\r\ndomestic crises, the settlement of disputes, the beginning of\r\nsocial and economic development, respect for human rights,\r\nhumanitarian help, decolonization and other legal rules in\r\ninternational relations are all fields in which the United\r\nNations is working. However, continuous attention to all\r\nthe achievements of the United Nations is needed.\r\nThe Organization, by adapting its structure to new\r\ncircumstances and needs, will be able to offer a stronger\r\ncommitment and to be the authoritative and dynamic guide\r\nthe world needs for the future.\r\nFurthermore, San Marino gives particular importance\r\nto a reform of the Security Council that will lead to an\r\nequitable distribution of its seats and to a greater\r\ntransparency in its work. The proper functioning of the\r\nSecurity Council, its close and coordinated relationship\r\nwith the General Assembly, and the widest possible\r\nrepresentation are the best guarantees that the United\r\nNations will be able to carry out its tasks.\r\nIn this context I believe it is appropriate to\r\nremember that small States, willing and capable of\r\nmaking a contribution, must enjoy equal rights and\r\ndignity, since both the big Powers and the various small\r\ncommunities are interested in the peaceful future of the\r\nworld, in the establishment of democracy and in the\r\nstrengthening of freedom.\r\nMore than 50 years ago, in June 1944, the world\r\nconflict brought death and ruin even to the neutral\r\nmountain of San Marino, which had no part in the\r\nconflict and where thousands of poor refugees, deprived\r\nof everything except their lives, had sought shelter. The\r\nappeal for peace launched almost 50 years ago by the\r\nsignatories of the San Francisco Charter is still\r\ndramatically up to date. Some might think that a peaceful\r\nworld is a mere Utopia, and they might be right. But I\r\nam firmly convinced that everyone must contribute to the\r\nachievement of this wonderful Utopia.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, Mr. Tariq\r\nAziz.\r\nMr. Aziz (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nshould like to convey to Mr. Essy of Côte d’Ivoire our\r\nsincere congratulations on his election to the presidency\r\nof the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. I am\r\ncertain that his experience will be a positive factor in\r\nensuring the success of the session’s deliberations.\r\nIraq is one of the founding Members of the United\r\nNations. Over the past five decades it has taken an active\r\npart in all the Organization’s activities, has cooperated\r\neffectively with its various organs and has contributed\r\ngenerously when it was able to do so. Iraq has also\r\nadhered to the decisions of the Organization in\r\naccordance with the letter and spirit of the Charter.\r\nAt the international level, Iraq has participated\r\nactively and responsibly in the Movement of Non-aligned\r\nCountries, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and\r\nthe League of Arab States. During the 1970s it provided\r\nassistance and soft loans amounting to about $10 billion\r\nto developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin and\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nCentral America. Iraq has called for justice in political and\r\neconomic relations and has affirmed the need to respect\r\ninternational law. These positions of Iraq are known to all.\r\nWhat now concerns my country is the nature of the\r\ncurrent stage of the relationship between Iraq and the\r\nSecurity Council, which is based on the Council’s\r\nresolution 687 (1991), adopted in April of that year. That\r\nresolution, which imposed a number of obligations on Iraq,\r\nhas no precedent among United Nations resolutions\r\nthroughout the history of the Organization. This is how it\r\nis seen today in international circles, both legal and\r\npolitical. However, despite its cruel and extraordinary\r\nnature, Iraq informed the Security Council that it was ready\r\nto comply with it within the requirements laid down by the\r\nCharter’s provisions regarding resolutions adopted under\r\nChapter VII.\r\nSince that date, despite the harsh conditions obtaining\r\nin our country as a result of the total war waged by the\r\nmost powerful States of the world — a war in which more\r\nthan 100,000 tons of explosives were dumped on civilian\r\nutilities throughout the country — and despite the effects of\r\nthe comprehensive and harsh embargo, Iraq has striven to\r\nimplement the resolution.\r\nIn March 1992 — less than a year after the adoption\r\nof the resolution — and in November of the same year we\r\ncame to the Security Council to explain the substantial and\r\nserious steps that had been taken by Iraq in the process of\r\nimplementing its provisions. On both occasions, we\r\nrequested that positive and fair consideration be given to\r\nwhat had been achieved and that steps be taken towards\r\neasing the comprehensive blockade imposed upon Iraq in\r\naccordance with the terms of the resolution and,\r\nspecifically, the unbearable suffering of the 20 million\r\npeople of Iraq. However, our requests were not heeded.\r\nIn the middle of 1993 Iraq’s relationship with the\r\nSpecial Commission and with the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) saw a breakthrough in the field of\r\npositive and constructive cooperation with a view to\r\ncompleting the implementation of part C of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 687 (1991) — the provisions relating to\r\nproscribed weapons, which the resolution legally ties to the\r\nlifting of the embargo on oil exports.\r\nIn the process of this cooperation — on\r\n26 November 1993 — we presented our official letter\r\nconcerning compliance with Security Council resolution 715\r\n(l991). The letter dealt with the monitoring of weapons.\r\nThis was done after we had been assured that Iraq’s official\r\nacknowledgment of compliance represented the most\r\nexpeditious means of securing the application of\r\nparagraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991). This clear and\r\ncategorical assurance is referred to in the report issued as\r\ndocument S/26571 on 12 October 1993. However, what\r\nwe were told would be done has not been done.\r\nDuring the past 11 months we have witnessed\r\ntransparent tactics to delay and obstruct. These have\r\ntaken various forms. Their purpose is to delay\r\nindefinitely the lifting of the embargo. In spite of the\r\nofficial acknowledgment by the Special Commission and\r\nthe IAEA of the relevant Iraqi authorities’ continuing\r\ncooperation, as well as the notable achievements of\r\ncompletion of the work required by those bodies over a\r\nperiod of more than a year, we still confront deliberate\r\nambiguity with regard to the Security Council’s discharge\r\nits obligations under paragraph 22, which permits the\r\nexport of Iraqi products and commodities, including oil.\r\nThe blockade imposed on Iraq represents the most\r\ncomprehensive regime ever imposed by the Security\r\nCouncil in all its history. With the exception of food and\r\nmedicine, it includes everything and affects all aspects of\r\nlife. As a result of the freezing of Iraqi assets in foreign\r\nbanks, Iraq is denied all the financial resources that would\r\nenable it to pay for the food and medicines its people\r\nneed. This has rendered practically redundant the\r\nexceptions relating to food and medicines.\r\nIn addition, the Sanctions Committee, which the\r\nSecurity Council entrusted with the task of authorizing the\r\nimportation of material to Iraq, agreed on the consensus\r\nmethod of making decisions. However, the reality is\r\nexactly the opposite: decisions are required to be\r\nunanimous.\r\nIt is sufficient for the objection of one member to\r\nfrustrate any request for imports. It is worth noting that\r\nonly three of the members of the Committee have been\r\nthe source of constant objections on the vast majority of\r\nthe import requests relating to the provision of\r\nhumanitarian civilian needs. What has made the situation\r\nin the Sanctions Committee even worse is that it proceeds\r\non the basis of procedures which do not recognize\r\nprecedents and deals with each case individually. This\r\nhas led to confusion, disorder and ambiguity in the work\r\nof the Committee in regard to what is permitted, both in\r\nrelation to quantity and quality. It is not difficult to see,\r\ntherefore, the harmful negative consequences of this\r\nmethod of work by the Committee on the flow of\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nhumanitarian goods, which are of a limited quantity\r\nanyway.\r\nLet me refer to some glaring examples. The Sanctions\r\nCommittee refused on numerous occasions to permit the\r\nimportation of shrouds, pencils, cloth of all kinds including\r\nthe type used for hospital bed sheets, threads of all kinds,\r\npaper for printing school books, leather, car tires including\r\nused tires, nails; the list is long and it is well documented\r\nin the records of the Committee.\r\nThis situation makes it incumbent upon the\r\ninternational community to reflect upon the philosophy of\r\nthe sanctions regime of within the Charter of the United\r\nNations. Is that regime a means to an end or is it an end\r\nin itself? Further, what is the nature of that regime? Is it\r\npunitive, or is it a series of procedures designed to achieve\r\nthe purposes of the Charter irrespective of the unilateral\r\ngoals and whims of foreign policies of Member States? It\r\nis well known to all that the sanctions regime under the\r\nCharter is nothing but a series of procedures adopted to\r\nachieve certain results that lead in turn to the achievement\r\nof the purposes and principles of the United Nations, and\r\nthat such procedures should end with the cessation of their\r\ncauses. What then is the state of correct application of\r\nthese procedures following all the cooperation and progress\r\nachieved in complying with the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil by Iraq? What is clear to us is that the application\r\nof sanctions and the embargo in the manner described\r\nagainst Iraq is a process of vengeance, a process aimed at\r\ndepriving the people of Iraq, a nation of with great history,\r\na nation which has contributed immensely to human\r\ncivilization, depriving it of the simplest requirements of\r\nhuman life.\r\nThe reports of the relevant specialized agencies\r\nindicate the continuing deterioration of living conditions of\r\nthe Iraqi citizens. The Iraqi Government makes available\r\nto every citizen a limited rations of flour, rice, tea, cooking\r\noil, soap, baby formula and whatever other items might be\r\navailable. This share is however to meet the basic\r\nnutritional needs of human beings. Of late, we have been\r\nforced to reduce this ration due to the lack of financial\r\nresources and as well as poor agricultural output resulting\r\nfrom the embargo. Consequently, the largest number of\r\ncitizens cannot buy what they lack of these and other items\r\nbecause of the high prices, especially for protein items, and\r\nthey are therefore suffering from malnutrition. This\r\nsituation has affected the physical wellbeing of the\r\nindividual citizen in Iraq.\r\nDespite the efforts of the Government to support and\r\ndevelop the agricultural sector, great difficulties continue\r\nto be faced due to the embargo. For example, the lack of\r\npesticides, insecticides, agricultural machinery and\r\nequipment, water pumps and fertilizers. We do not have\r\nthe financial means to offset these shortages; and when\r\nwe do have some financial resources, the Sanctions\r\nCommittee promptly obstructs their importation.\r\nThe Joint Mission of the Food and Agricultural\r\nOrganization and the World Food Programme, which\r\nvisited Iraq in June 1993, did indicate in its Special Alert\r\nNo. 237 (1993) the magnitude of the danger resulting\r\nfrom the blockade on the agricultural capabilities of Iraq,\r\nwhich caused the loss of food-security and generated\r\npersistent deprivation, chronic hunger and endemic\r\nmalnutrition among the vast majority of the population.\r\nThe third FAO Special Report of May 1994 dealt with the\r\ngrave problems of providing food and crops in Iraq due\r\nto the shortages of agricultural requirements. The same\r\nReport noted that these problems cannot be solved by the\r\nprovision of food aid and that the permanent solution to\r\nthe present food crisis lies in reviving the Iraqi economy\r\nwhich cannot be achieved without resuming the activity\r\nof international trade. It is also indicated that the\r\nrationing system used by the Iraqi Government, though\r\nvery successful, provides only about one-half of the\r\naverage caloric intake which used to be available to the\r\ncitizens of Iraq before the imposition of the sanctions.\r\nIn the public health sector, health services have\r\ndeteriorated, after they had been amongst the relatively\r\nadvanced in the world. Due to shortages of medicine and\r\nthe deterioration of medical equipment, cases of death\r\nhave reached 384,022 cases from August 1990 to March\r\n1994. The cases of death among infants have also\r\nincreased and now reach 126 cases per l00,000 live births\r\nwhereas it had been only 32 per thousand in the period\r\n1985 to 1990.\r\nThere are those who claim that the Government of\r\nIraq is the party responsible for not making available\r\nfood, medicine and essential civilian needs to the people\r\nbecause it has refused to accept Security Council\r\nresolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Such allegations\r\nare mere falsifications.\r\nFair and objective consideration of the full picture of\r\nthe arrangements adopted in these two resolutions would\r\nlead one to the conclusion that they do represent\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\na political programme aimed at violating the sovereignty of\r\nIraq, interfering in its internal affairs and dividing its people\r\nalong ethnic and sectarian lines, rather than ensuring the\r\nsatisfying of humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq.\r\nThrough five rounds of talks with the Secretariat in Vienna\r\nand New York in 1992 and 1993 we have sought to reach\r\nacceptable modalities through sound arrangements in order\r\nto ensure the satisfaction of the humanitarian civilian needs\r\nof our people. However, despite the sustained efforts that\r\nhave been made, such efforts have failed to reach an\r\nappropriate solution, a solution free of the objectives of the\r\nbiased political programme through the pressures brought\r\nto bear by the United States. One of the major ironies\r\nduring those talks was that the oil and banking experts who\r\nwere part of the United Nations delegation did acknowledge\r\nthat the arrangements adopted in the two said resolutions\r\nwere not at all customary in the oil and banking fields.\r\nCould it be deemed reasonable by anyone involved in\r\nthe oil industry that the signing of an oil-export contract\r\nshould require no less than 30 procedural steps? Do\r\nMembers realize that the banking arrangements stipulated\r\nby the two resolutions totally ignore the existence of a\r\ndeveloped banking sector in Iraq? Do Members realize that\r\na simple contract for the importation of food or medicine\r\nrequires no fewer than 20 bureaucratic steps in order for\r\nthose goods to reach Iraq, and that even after their arrival\r\nthey are subject to monitoring by hundreds of United\r\nNations monitors from the time they leave the Iraqi border\r\nuntil they reach the consumer? This is the true story of\r\nresolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Those two\r\nresolutions were never intended to meet the humanitarian\r\nneeds of the people of Iraq.\r\nIn the course of the Security Council’s periodic\r\nreviews, which take place every 60 days and the latest of\r\nwhich took place on 14 September last, the United States\r\nfalsely accused Iraq on various counts in order to justify its\r\nposition of delaying the lifting of sanctions indefinitely.\r\nWe find it useful to refer to some examples of these\r\naccusations so that the General Assembly may see the\r\npicture clearly.\r\nThe United States charges that Iraq’s cooperation with\r\nthe Security Council has been sporadic, selective and\r\nopportunistic. This is a baseless accusation. It is well\r\nknown that Iraq agreed to comply with the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council and sought persistently\r\nto implement their provisions correctly and legally. We\r\nbelieve that the majority of the members of the Security\r\nCouncil do not join the United States in its accusation.\r\nThe United States also charges that Iraq’s record\r\nwith respect to the implementation of its obligations in\r\nthe area of proscribed weapons was a partial and grudging\r\nacquiescence to United Nations demands. The facts,\r\nhowever, prove otherwise. This is made clear in the\r\nreports of the Special Commission and the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency, especially those issued since July\r\n1993. The latest of those reports, circulated in document\r\nS/1994/860, states,\r\n“The Special Commission and the IAEA noted\r\nwith appreciation the constructive cooperation\r\nreceived from Iraq and the efforts made by the\r\ncompetent Iraqi authorities in the conduct of their\r\ntasks.” (S/1994/860, para. 6)\r\nAnother accusation is that the Government of Iraq cut off\r\nelectricity from certain areas in the northern Iraqi\r\nGovernorates. Those who make this accusation ignore the\r\nfact that the comprehensive embargo imposed upon Iraq\r\ndoes not make sufficient financial resources available to\r\nthe Government to import spare parts and equipment for\r\nensuring the maintenance of electrical service in the\r\ncountry. Moreover, the accusers are the very ones who\r\nconstantly object in the sanctions Committee to Iraqi\r\nrequests for importing material with which to maintain the\r\nelectricity grid, in the event we have some resources\r\navailable to that end.\r\nThe United States also accuses the Government of\r\nIraq of draining the marshes in the southern part of the\r\ncountry in pursuit of a political programme aimed against\r\nthe population of the area. According to the allegation,\r\nthis action destroys their cultural heritage and causes\r\nharm to the environment. I say that this accusation, like\r\nthe others, is baseless. It is utterly at odds with the sense\r\nof objectivity expected of a permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe truth is that the Government of Iraq carried out\r\nextensive irrigation projects in the southern part of the\r\ncountry, including the area of the marshes, in order to\r\nreduce salinity in the water and soil, which is a problem\r\nin central and southern Iraq, thereby increasing the\r\namount of arable land. The planning for these projects\r\ngoes back to the days of the Rehabilitation Board in the\r\nfifties. American, British, French, German, Dutch,\r\nRussian and Canadian companies and consultants\r\nparticipated in drawing up and revising the plans and, in\r\npart, in their implementation.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nAfter the imposition of the comprehensive blockade\r\nthe competent Iraqi authorities completed the projects by\r\nthemselves. One of the ironies of the situation is that the\r\nprincipal proponent of draining the marshes of southern\r\nIraq in the fifties was an American expert working for the\r\nIraqi Board. It is also ironic that one of the rivers in the\r\narea is still called the Dutch River because a Dutch\r\ncompany carried out a project there.\r\nI have been prompted to mention some of the\r\naccusations levelled at Iraq in order to shed light on the\r\nreal situation and the fabrications and falsifications used as\r\npretexts to prolong the iniquitous blockade against us. But\r\nit is even more important to refer to some glaring examples\r\nof the conduct of those who accuse us, to wit, the United\r\nStates of America.\r\nThe United States, the State that is so concerned with\r\nrespect for Security Council resolutions, imposes two no-fly\r\nzones in the north and the south of Iraq without any\r\nauthorization from the Security Council or any legitimate\r\njustification under international law. The United States\r\nAdministration, which pretends to be so concerned over the\r\nrights of the Kurds in Iraq, was the very party that\r\nprevented the leaders of the Kurds from honouring an\r\nagreement that, after four months of dialogue, was freely\r\nentered into with the Government of Iraq in 1991. The\r\nUnited States Administration stated openly that that\r\nagreement would have strengthened the authority of the\r\npresent national Government in Iraq, which was contrary to\r\nthe United States objective of changing that Government.\r\nIs this attitude in harmony with the Security Council\r\nresolutions that provide for respect of sovereignty and the\r\nachievement of international peace and security and stability\r\nin the region? Is it acceptable, under the resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council, for that Administration to obstruct the\r\noperation of flights transporting pilgrims from a friendly\r\nMuslim State to Iraq’s sacred religious shrines under the\r\npretext that a number of politicians from that State were\r\namong the pilgrims? That very Administration also\r\nobstructed, under flimsy pretexts, the aerial shipment of\r\nmeat from the Sudan to Iraq.\r\nLastly in this connection, I should like to affirm that\r\nIraq expressed, in the words of its leader, President Saddam\r\nHussein, its sincere desire to turn a new leaf with its\r\nneighbouring Arab countries in order to establish relations\r\nbased on the Charter of the League of Arab States, the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and on the basis of mutual\r\nrespect for one another’s sovereignty and regard for each\r\nother’s interests. However, it is well known to all that the\r\nUnited States Administration is the party that obstructs\r\nthose efforts and brings pressure to bear on the States of\r\nthe region to prevent dialogue with Iraq. The article by\r\nUnited States Secretary of State Warren Christopher\r\npublished in The New York Times last April is, we\r\nbelieve, the most telling evidence in that respect.\r\nDespite the harshness of the Security Council’s\r\nresolutions concerning Iraq, we have implemented many\r\nof their provisions fully. We are legally and correctly\r\ncontinuing with the implementation of whatever\r\nprovisions remain in the relevant resolutions. Within this\r\nprocess, we are also prepared to satisfy and allay the\r\nconcerns of the members of the Security Council of\r\nwhich we have become aware in our contacts, although\r\nsome of them have been introduced in legally irrelevant\r\ncontexts.\r\nIn the meantime, however, we wonder: is it the duty\r\nof the State in question under the Charter to implement\r\nthe provisions of the Security Council resolutions adopted\r\nunder Chapter VII, without expecting any counter-\r\nobligations from the Council to implement the same\r\nprovisions? The just, legal view is that resolutions of the\r\nCouncil adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter are\r\nbinding upon the State in question and all other States,\r\nparticularly the members of the Security Council, and\r\neven more particularly the Permanent Members of the\r\nSecurity Council. This, undoubtedly, is the rule of the\r\nCharter. It is therefore a foregone conclusion that the\r\nmembers of the Security Council, and especially its\r\nPermanent Members, should be keener than any other to\r\nabide by the resolutions they themselves adopt. However,\r\nthe facts of the situation now are that one Permanent\r\nMember, namely the United States of America, is\r\npersistently obstructing any steps towards the correct legal\r\napplication of the resolutions of the Council, particularly\r\nthose provisions relating to the lifting of sanctions from\r\nIraq, and is conducting itself on the basis of biased\r\npolitical motives that bear no relation to either the\r\nresolutions of the Council or the Charter.\r\nThe General Assembly is the general organ entrusted\r\nwith deliberating on the world Organization as a whole\r\nunder the Charter. Under the Charter, Member States\r\nhave conferred on the Security Council the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, and have agreed that in carrying out its\r\nduties under this responsibility, the Security Council acts\r\non their behalf, in accordance with the Purposes and\r\nPrinciples of the United Nations Charter. Consequently,\r\nunder the Charter, the members of the Security Council,\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nboth individually and collectively, bear the joint\r\nresponsibility of the membership of the Organization. The\r\ncollectivity of membership, as represented by the General\r\nAssembly, does not, on the basis of the delegation of\r\npower, lose the right to seek, through all available means,\r\nthe correction of any failure that might arise in performing\r\nthat responsibility.\r\nProceeding from this, we request that the members of\r\nthe Security Council, the General Assembly and the\r\ninternational community as a whole look into the iniquitous\r\nand illegitimate situation in which one or two Permanent\r\nMembers obstruct the correct legal application of the\r\nresolutions of the Security Council and consequently\r\ncontinue to impose upon the Iraqi people, a nation of\r\nancient history, cruel suffering afflicting all aspects of\r\nhuman life.\r\nIt is within Iraq’s right to demand strongly that this\r\niniquitous and illegitimate situation be changed as soon as\r\npossible and to seek full clarification of the position of the\r\nSecurity Council on its just demands.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Petros Solomon, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Solomon (Eritrea): At the outset I wish to seize\r\nthis opportunity to congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his\r\nelection as the President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session. I am confident that he will guide our\r\ndeliberations with wisdom and skill.\r\nPermit me also to rejoice with the people of South\r\nAfrica, who have at long last eradicated apartheid and\r\ncreated a plural society in which all citizens of South\r\nAfrica shall live in harmony, freedom and equality,\r\nirrespective of their ethnic, religious or class backgrounds.\r\nTheir victory is a victory of good over evil and a tribute to\r\nthe concept of unity in diversity, as well as a unique\r\nexample of the concerted, unremitting and successful\r\nstruggle of humanity against a pernicious assault on human\r\ndignity and nobility.\r\nWe are also happy to note that in the Middle East age-\r\nold adversaries have come close enough to resolve some of\r\nthe most intractable problems of our time by negotiations\r\nbased on understanding and the accommodation of the\r\ninterests of all parties. We welcome the agreements\r\nreached between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO), as well as subsequent agreements\r\nreached between Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of\r\nJordan. We hope that this initial move, whose\r\nmomentum must be maintained, will augur well for a\r\ncomprehensive, permanent and enduring peace in the\r\nregion as a whole.\r\nWe have now entered a new era of renewed hope.\r\nAs the United Nations approaches its golden jubilee, it\r\nhas become increasingly evident that the majority of the\r\nnations and peoples of the world believe that the world\r\nOrganization is essential and are reposing renewed hope\r\nand confidence in it. In the aftermath of the cold war, we\r\nare witnessing a transition towards a new pattern of\r\ninternational relations. With the uncertainty of the\r\nhistorical process that is establishing a new world order,\r\nthe United Nations has once again become the eminently\r\nrelevant, perhaps even the indispensable, Organization\r\nthat its founding fathers wished it to be.\r\nThe emerging new international system and the\r\nuniversality of the membership of the United Nations, as\r\nwell as the abundant good will it has garnered, offer it the\r\nunique opportunity not only to establish new guidelines to\r\naddress international challenges but to ensure that the\r\ncoming new world will be permeated with the values of\r\ncollective security, peace, democracy, social justice and\r\ncooperation for mutual benefit. This is also a favourable\r\ntime for the United Nations to raise global awareness,\r\nfashion a common world outlook, probe new frontiers and\r\ncreate new standards, particularly in the realms of\r\nsustainable and equitable global development; conflict\r\nprevention, management and resolution; human and\r\ndemocratic rights; and social justice.\r\nThose great tasks, my delegation is convinced, will\r\ninevitably require commensurate changes in the structure\r\nand functional modalities of the United Nations system\r\nitself, if it is to cope with the challenges of the new\r\ninternational order. The institutions and agencies that\r\nreflected the exigencies of the last half-century must be\r\nmodified or yield to new ones that mirror not only the\r\noptimism and needs of the present but also the hopes and\r\naspirations of the future. The international system must\r\nturn — obviously, at a gradual and measured pace —\r\ntowards a fairer and more equitable representation of its\r\nconstituencies in all the organs of the system, and\r\nespecially in the Security Council. This may indeed be\r\nthe most opportune time to review structural issues with\r\nnew vision and boldness, the ultimate purpose being to\r\ninstil and build into the system a dynamism that will\r\nenable it to respond and adjust promptly to changing\r\nglobal realities.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nFurthermore, we feel that the United Nations must\r\nplace significant emphasis on the creation of a reliable early\r\nwarning system that would enable it to avert disasters and\r\nconflicts. An active, rather than a reactive, role on the part\r\nof the United Nations can go a long way towards reducing,\r\nif not preventing, human suffering and towards mitigating\r\ndisasters and conflicts at reduced cost to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nSecondly, all available evidence on the structure of the\r\nUnited Nations emphasizes the need to restructure it on the\r\nbasis of equilibrium between the forces of centralization\r\nand decentralization. Certain problems, such as the\r\nenvironment, population and disarmament, may necessitate\r\ncoordinated international action and centralized authority.\r\nOthers, including the breakdown of political systems and\r\nregional inter-State conflicts may be better and more\r\ncorrectly understood and solved by regional actors,\r\ninstitutions and approaches. There is thus an imperative to\r\nset in motion a dynamic arrangement balancing\r\ncentralization and decentralization to create the desired\r\njuridical basis for a new world order underpinned by a\r\npolitical culture of peace, justice, economic well-being and\r\na healthy environment. Playing such a catalytic role should\r\nbe the major preoccupation of the United Nations. Only\r\nsuch an environment can make the Organization an\r\neffective actor that protects and promotes peace,\r\ndevelopment and human rights.\r\nThe situation in the Horn of Africa is far from\r\nsatisfactory, although it may be improving day by day. I\r\nmust perhaps emphasize here that the impoverishment that\r\nstalks the region as a whole is largely man-made and\r\ncannot be attributed to the vicissitudes of nature, as is often\r\ndone. Decades of war and civil strife have sapped the\r\nenergy, productive capacity and problem-solving\r\nmechanisms of the populations, leaving them easily\r\nsusceptible to even minor imbalances in rainfall patterns\r\nand natural calamities.\r\nHence, international emergency assistance and, even\r\nmore, development assistance will remain vital for years to\r\ncome in overcoming the consequences of decades of war\r\nand turmoil. We in the Government of Eritrea, along with\r\nour regional partners, realize that reliable and sustainable\r\neconomic development will lie in effective regional\r\ncooperation hinging on durable peace and stability. It is in\r\nthis spirit that we and our partners are prepared to pool our\r\nresources to secure regional peace through mechanisms of\r\nclose consultation and coordination for conflict prevention\r\nand resolution, and by broadening areas of economic\r\ninteraction and cooperation.\r\nIt is against this backdrop, and within the framework\r\nof a regional approach, that we have attempted to address\r\nthe quest for collective security in our region. In Somalia\r\nthe countries of the region, under the chairmanship of\r\nPresident Melles Zenawi of Ethiopia, have done much to\r\nrestore normalcy to the country by bringing the warring\r\nfactions to the negotiating table. This regional effort has\r\ncomplemented and acted as a vital linkage to international\r\nintervention at a number of crucial junctures.\r\nIn this connection, we believe that this is an\r\nauspicious moment for the United Nations to decide to\r\nfocus in the period ahead only on the provision of\r\nassistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the\r\ndevastated country of Somalia. The opinion advanced by\r\nsome in the last few days that the extension of the\r\nmandate of the United Nations Operation in Somalia\r\n(UNOSOM) is vital for and will enhance political\r\nreconciliation is, we are convinced, seriously flawed.\r\nIndeed, all evidence from the country indicates that such\r\naction is likely to complicate or delay the process. On\r\nthe other hand, the Inter-Governmental Authority on\r\nDrought and Development (IGADD) should take upon\r\nitself, and be encouraged to continue, the political\r\nreconciliation it has facilitated in the past.\r\nIn the Sudan, the countries of the region have\r\napplied the same regional approach and have proposed\r\ndifferent frameworks of conflict resolution to facilitate a\r\ncomprehensive political settlement that takes into account\r\nthe best interests and welfare of both sides. Here, too,\r\nthe international community should encourage and support\r\nthe regional efforts undertaken under the auspices of\r\nIGADD.\r\nSome of the major problems that have existed for\r\nmany years are still with us and, indeed, there are now\r\nnew ones. Thus, the crisis in the former Yugoslavia does\r\nnot appear to be any nearer to solution. The events in\r\nRwanda are a tragic reminder of human folly and have\r\netched an indelible mark on the collective conscience of\r\nhumanity. These events no doubt reinforce the necessity\r\nfor preventive measures and perhaps the need to make a\r\nfresh assessment of the conventional limitations of the\r\nUnited Nations in peace-keeping.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n21\r\n"
