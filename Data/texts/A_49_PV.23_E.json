Côte d’Ivoire\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Prince Mbilini\r\nDlamini, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the Prime Minister\r\nof the Kingdom of Swaziland.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Mbilini Dlamini, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Swaziland, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland, His Royal Highness Prince Mbilini\r\nDlamini, and inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nPrince Dlamini (Swaziland): I bring with me the\r\ngreetings and good wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III,\r\nHer Majesty the Indlovukazi, the Government and people\r\nof the Kingdom of Swaziland to all our friends and fellow\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nOn behalf of Swaziland, may I begin by offering my\r\nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. We are confident that with your able leadership\r\nour deliberations will be guided towards a successful\r\nconclusion, for the benefit of the global community.\r\nLet me also offer Swaziland’s gratitude and praise to\r\nyour predecessor, whose wise direction ensured the\r\nsuccess of the deliberations of the Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session.\r\nThe past 12 months have presented many challenges\r\nto our Organization, in its pivotal role as an effective\r\ninstrument for fostering global peace and security, and as\r\na dynamic forum for promoting a spirit of understanding\r\nand cooperation among the nations of the world.\r\nClearly, significant progress has been made in\r\nmeeting these challenges, and my delegation recognizes\r\nthe role of the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr.\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, whose diplomatic skills and\r\nuntiring efforts have contributed so greatly to the\r\ncontinuing ability of the United Nations to achieve the\r\nsuccesses on which the whole world depends.\r\nIn April this year, the eyes of the world were\r\nfocused on South Africa as the people of that country\r\nwent to the polls to elect, for the first time, a Government\r\nthat would represent all South Africans, regardless of\r\nrace, religion or creed. Today, in a triumph for the spirit\r\nof reconciliation, peace and compromise among all South\r\nAfricans, we welcome the new, non-racial and democratic\r\nSouth Africa back into the family of the United Nations.\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nWhile congratulating the people of South Africa for\r\ntheir substantial achievement, the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nalso salutes the role of the United Nations in bringing about\r\nan end to a regime it had long opposed. As a result the\r\nmillions of South African people who had been denied a\r\nvoice in this Hall will once more be heard. South Africa’s\r\ntriumph is therefore also a victory for the principle of\r\nuniversality, on which the United Nations was founded.\r\nAs neighbour, partner and ally, Swaziland, and the\r\nother countries in the subregion, have particular reason to\r\nrejoice at the successful process of transition in South\r\nAfrica. Quite apart from the benefit of peace to the area\r\nbrought about by a successful political transformation, we\r\nall look forward to enjoying the fruits of closer economic\r\nand trade cooperation with the region’s most influential\r\ncountry.\r\nSwaziland has been most impressed with the very\r\nclear policy of His Excellency President Mandela, stated\r\nconsistently since he took office in May, on the importance\r\nof close cooperation with others in the region.\r\nWe have already welcomed South Africa into the\r\nSouthern African Development Community, and other\r\ninitiatives are under way to forge closer trade and economic\r\nlinks between our newly liberated neighbour and the rest of\r\nthe subregion, for South Africa cannot expect to stand on\r\nits own in the future. It is a fact that the economic\r\ndestinies of the nations in our subregion are inextricably\r\nbound together.\r\nEven as we celebrate the return of peace and stability\r\nin South Africa, our continent continues to provide some of\r\nthe worst examples of people’s inhumanity to one another.\r\nSwaziland watched with horror as the tragedy unfolded\r\nearlier this year in Rwanda. Many words have been spoken\r\nhere about the dreadful scenes we all witnessed, and our\r\nhearts went out to the millions whose lives were shattered\r\nby the effects of the civil war there. No other justification\r\nis needed to spur on our efforts to address the issue of\r\nconflict prevention and resolution than the loss of so many\r\nlives, so quickly, in Rwanda. We pray that a formula for\r\ntrue, lasting peace may be found, and that the two peoples\r\nmay be able to find some way of living side by side with\r\neach other.\r\nThe situations in Burundi, Liberia, Sudan and Somalia\r\nalso continue to give us cause for grave concern.\r\nSwaziland supports all peaceful efforts aimed at bringing\r\nabout negotiated settlements to the problems in these\r\ncountries.\r\nDespite the many set-backs to peace on our\r\ncontinent, the past twelve months have also seen\r\nsubstantial progress among a number of countries -\r\nprogress which owes much to the efforts of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nI have spoken already of our admiration for the\r\ndevelopments in one of our neighbouring countries, South\r\nAfrica, which took the path of reconciliation and peace\r\ntowards the much-needed process of reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe same degree of respect applies to our other\r\nneighbour, Mozambique, which, after so long a period of\r\nbitter hatred amongst its people, has at last chosen to lay\r\ndown weapons in favour of the ballot box. Swaziland\r\njoins the world in praying for a peaceful election process\r\nlater this month, and calls on the leaders to allow the\r\nsame spirit of reconciliation and unity that brought an end\r\nto the war after so many years to continue after a new\r\ngovernment has been chosen.\r\nWe appeal to the international community to\r\ncontinue to provide the financial, technical, moral and\r\nmaterial support that will be necessary for Mozambique\r\nto rebuild itself, and to give its people a chance to fulfil\r\ntheir high potential.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland warmly welcomes the\r\nagreement that brought about a peaceful solution to the\r\nsituation prevailing in our sister Kingdom of Lesotho.\r\nWe welcome the opportunity presented now for the\r\nBasotho people themselves to address their concerns. It\r\nis our fervent hope that the agreement will be\r\nimplemented successfully, without undue delay, so that\r\nlasting peace and stability may come to the kingdom.\r\nThe direct effects of developments on our continent\r\nare of obvious concern to the Kingdom of Swaziland.\r\nBut in this day and age of global interdependence, the\r\npotential effects on us of situations outside Africa are of\r\nequal importance. Two recent developments provide\r\nparticular cause for hope in areas of long-running dispute.\r\nIn the Middle East, the seeds of peace and\r\nreconciliation, sown last year by Prime Minister Rabin\r\nand Chairman Arafat, and encouraged by the United\r\nStates, Norway, the United Nations and others, are at last\r\nbearing fruit. Talk of trade and cooperation is replacing\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nthe noise of gunfire, as the bitter rivalries of generations\r\ngive way to a new order of peace in the region.\r\nSwaziland salutes all those who contributed to the\r\nprocess of peace in the Middle East; we appeal to the\r\nleaders of the region to join in the process and to allow it\r\nto continue without disruption, so that precious resources\r\nmay be directed towards worthwhile development goals.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has long been concerned\r\nabout the spread of nuclear weapons, and the effect this has\r\nhad on world stability. We were therefore encouraged by\r\nthe recent initiatives on the part of the United States and\r\nRussia to substantially reduce the number of their weapons.\r\nWe also support all efforts on the Korean peninsula,\r\nwhere disaster has been pending, to bring about real\r\nprogress on the nuclear issue. This issue has been the\r\nfocus of major instability for the entire far-east region, and\r\nSwaziland fully supports all efforts to bring about a\r\npeaceful resolution to the problem.\r\nWe look forward to the peaceful reunification of the\r\ntwo Koreas, and encourage all moves to bring this to\r\nfruition.\r\nWars and conflict situations in Africa and around the\r\nworld continue to stretch our belief that people can ever\r\nlive peacefully with one another. More and more, the\r\nresources of the United Nations are being overextended to\r\nmeet the challenges these situations present, and conflict\r\nresolution finds itself close to the top of the agenda for\r\naction by this Assembly.\r\nMercifully, the Kingdom of Swaziland has been spared\r\nthe horrors of internal conflict, but no country can really\r\nfeel immune to the effects of war and confrontation,\r\nwherever these may be occurring. Deciding on the best\r\nway for the world to cope with conflict situations is\r\ntherefore a problem we all share, and we in Africa are\r\nconscious of our particular responsibility for deciding on\r\nmechanisms to limit, prevent and cope with conflict\r\nsituations developing on our continent.\r\nThis issue has been central during discussions at\r\nsubregional and regional conferences. Most recently,\r\nimportant resolutions were adopted at the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) summit in Tunis, and at the Southern\r\nAfrica Development Community summit in Gaborone,\r\nwhich went some way towards deciding on the regional\r\nresponse to one of Africa’s most pressing problems.\r\nBut despite almost unanimous willingness for our\r\ncountries to become involved more directly in the\r\ncontinent’s conflicts, it was clearly recognized that the\r\nmajority of us lacked the resources to lend an effective\r\nhand.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland therefore supports the\r\ngrowing call for an integrated approach to conflict\r\nresolution on our continent, which would bring close\r\ncooperation between Africa and the rest of the world by\r\nestablishing mechanisms to coordinate the resources of\r\nboth in the most effective way. The OAU is clearly in\r\nthe best place to mobilize the efforts of its members - and\r\nmost important of all, to undertake preventive diplomacy\r\nbefore a situation has the chance to develop - while the\r\nUnited Nations can continue to play its role as\r\ncoordinator of the international response.\r\nMany of Africa’s present conflicts could well have\r\nbeen prevented or contained if properly coordinated\r\nmechanisms had already been in place. The Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland welcomes discussion here so that a plan of\r\naction can be agreed upon quickly on this vitally\r\nimportant issue.\r\nIn this regard, and as a measure of Swaziland’s\r\nacceptance of her responsibility to the rest of the world,\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III announced at the OAU\r\nsummit in Tunis this year that he would be taking steps\r\nto decide how best the Kingdom’s small defence force\r\ncould be used alongside other troops in multinational\r\nforces for the benefit of global peace and stability.\r\nHis Majesty has begun the process of investigating\r\nunder what conditions the nation’s soldiers can be\r\noffered, bearing in mind the small size of the defence\r\nforce and our relative lack of appropriate weapons and\r\nequipment. Clearly, we cannot allow our soldiers to enter\r\ninto potentially dangerous situations without proper\r\nprotection and without adequate training.\r\nThese are some of the issues to be looked at before\r\nwe can fully commit ourselves to taking this more active\r\nrole in global peace-keeping, and we will be approaching\r\nthe Secretary-General for consultations on this important\r\ninitiative.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is entrusted\r\nwith the task of discussing \"An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment\". The focus of the world is on the\r\nrequirement now to channel our resources towards\r\nachieving lasting global stability through the sustainable\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\ndevelopment of our countries, providing us with improved\r\nstandards for all our peoples.\r\nThe welcome end to the period of confrontation\r\nbetween the world’s super-Powers should mean that\r\nincreased global resources can now be redirected to\r\nachieving a new and more balanced world economic order.\r\nCloser attention can now be given to the plight of all\r\ndeveloping countries, which continue to suffer the effects\r\nof serious development neglect. This crucial point was\r\ndiscussed at length at last weekend’s meeting of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) in Madrid, where the\r\nview of the developing world was made very clear.\r\nThe continent of Africa contains the highest number\r\nof the world’s poorest countries, and any agenda for\r\ndevelopment should take into account the special\r\ncircumstances surrounding the inability of this region to\r\ndevelop effectively.\r\nWe in the region know ourselves, all too well, what\r\nfactors continue to obstruct our progress. It is a familiar\r\ncatalogue, including resource constraints; inappropriate\r\ndevelopment policies; the slow pace of industrialization and\r\ntransformation into producers of processed goods;\r\ninadequate infrastructure; natural disasters; and a continuing\r\nround of armed conflicts.\r\nWe know the problems, and we are trying our best to\r\novercome them. We understand our responsibility to our\r\npeople to mobilize our resources in the most effective way\r\nto overcome the obstacles to national development. The\r\nneed is clear, and our resources and abilities are limited,\r\nbut we are trying hard. We also recognize that we cannot\r\nhope to achieve long-term sustainable development without,\r\nat least, the short-term assistance of the rest of the global\r\ncommunity.\r\nMuch of what we need is contained in the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s, and our continent’s collective appeal is for the swift\r\nand full implementation of its many programmes. But each\r\nnation has its separate, distinct needs.\r\nSwaziland welcomes recent initiatives towards\r\nstrengthening South-South cooperation, and we believe they\r\nwill result in real progress towards overcoming the\r\neconomic challenges facing us all in that grouping.\r\nIn trying to meet our national economic development\r\nobjectives, the Kingdom of Swaziland has adopted a broad\r\nand integrated approach aimed at achieving sustainable,\r\n\"human-centred\" development, through policies that focus\r\non the priorities of the reduction of poverty, universal\r\naccess to primary school, and affordable primary health\r\ncare.\r\nRecent United Nations initiatives also guide us in\r\nour Government policies. As a follow-up to the Earth\r\nSummit, for example, we have established a national\r\nenvironmental authority to ensure that environmental\r\nconcerns are properly integrated into all stages of public\r\npolicy and national development strategy formulation.\r\nSwaziland welcomed the opportunity to address the\r\nrecent United Nations Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment in Cairo, and the adoption of the\r\nProgramme of Action constitutes a significant step in our\r\ncollective aim. The Kingdom had already embraced the\r\noption of acceptable child spacing as the cornerstone of\r\nour population growth policy, and we have begun a\r\ncomprehensive programme of education for our people in\r\nthe realities of and efforts to deal with overpopulation.\r\nThese and all aspects of the economic development\r\nof the Kingdom will be debated by the whole nation\r\nduring the process of national economic consultation,\r\nwhich was recently initiated by His Majesty the King.\r\nThe process is designed to allow all Swazis the\r\nopportunity to be involved in deciding the future direction\r\nof the Kingdom’s economy, and will embody the nation’s\r\nwishes for future priorities and strategies. These in turn\r\nwill form the basis of our request for future support from\r\nour friends in the international community, and we will be\r\nkeeping the United Nations fully informed of\r\ndevelopments.\r\nThe process follows on from last year’s very\r\nsuccessful political reforms, resulting from a similar\r\nperiod of national consultation, which concluded last\r\nOctober with direct elections to Parliament under a new\r\nsystem of secret ballot. The democratic elections were\r\ndeclared free and fair by the international community and,\r\nmore importantly, were what the Swazi people themselves\r\nhad chosen.\r\nBoth processes - political and economic reform -\r\nshow clearly Swaziland’s principle of rule by consensus\r\nof the people. We believe this principle is at the heart of\r\nthe peace and stability we have enjoyed for many\r\ngenerations, and it has spared us the horrors of internal\r\nconflict suffered by so many on our continent.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nI spoke earlier of South Africa’s return to the\r\ninternational community, as, among other things, a triumph\r\nfor the United Nations in upholding the principle of\r\nuniversality. The Kingdom of Swaziland urges the\r\nAssembly to apply the same principle to investigate the\r\nmerits of the case of the Republic of China in Taiwan.\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III joined a number of other\r\nHeads of State in raising this issue at the forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. His Majesty called for\r\nthe establishment of an ad hoc committee to determine\r\nwhether or not the Republic of China had a reasonable case\r\nfor rejoining our Organization. This call has been taken up\r\nby an increasing number of countries that support the idea\r\nof looking into the issue in more detail.\r\nQuite apart from the principle of universality, there are\r\nother important factors for us to consider when reviewing\r\nthe case. The Republic of China in Taiwan has much to\r\noffer to the world community. It clearly has the resources\r\nto be of more use to the rest of the international\r\ncommunity. More important, though, is the desire of the\r\nRepublic of China to be of use - and assistance - to the rest\r\nof the world.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland, along with a large\r\nnumber of other developing countries throughout Africa,\r\nAsia and the Americas, has had first-hand evidence of the\r\nRepublic of China’s willingness to offer generous\r\nhumanitarian and development assistance.\r\nAs more and more worthy targets appear for the\r\nUnited Nations resources, we can surely ill afford to reject\r\nthe call to investigate further whether that country’s\r\nassistance can be put to wider use through the agencies of\r\nour Organization.\r\nAt the heart of the issue, though, is the fact that 21\r\nmillion people believe that they are not represented in the\r\nUnited Nations. These people believe that they are\r\nexcluded from our founding principle of universality. In\r\nconsideration of this right, which they believe has been\r\ndenied them, the time has surely come for us to listen to\r\ntheir voices.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes and supports the\r\nparticipation of the Republic of China In Taiwan in the\r\nactivities of the United Nations, and we therefore call once\r\nmore for the establishment of an ad hoc committee to\r\nreview the case for their re-admittance to the Organization.\r\nThe United Nations has a distinguished history of 49\r\nyears of growth and achievement. The challenges we\r\nfaced almost 50 years ago, as the world emerged from\r\nglobal conflict, have changed in substance but not in\r\nimportance.\r\nWe have the opportunity now, in this forum, to lay\r\nthe foundations for an agenda for development that will\r\nbring about the stability and peace we all desire.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is proud of its\r\nmembership of the United Nations and commends the\r\nwork of all who have contributed to the many successes\r\nover the years. The nation is deeply indebted to the\r\nUnited Nations agencies, whose efforts are contributing so\r\nmuch to the attainment of our development goals.\r\nOn behalf of His Majesty King Mswati III, Her\r\nMajesty the Indlovukazi, and the whole Swazi nation, I\r\nshould like to reaffirm my country’s full support for, and\r\ncommitment to, the Charter of the United Nations. May\r\nAlmighty God bless these deliberations with the success\r\nthey deserve.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Mbilini Dlamini, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Swaziland, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nnext speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Viet\r\nNam, Mr. Nguyen Manh Cam, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Nguyen Manh Cam (Viet Nam) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): First, allow me, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, to\r\ncongratulate you warmly, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. I am confident that, under your guidance and\r\nwith the active contributions of member countries, this\r\nsession of the General Assembly will have a successful\r\noutcome. I also wish to take this opportunity to express\r\nour admiration for the efficient performance of your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Samuel R. Insanally. We greatly\r\nappreciate the great efforts made by Mr. Boutros-Ghali in\r\nhis high post as Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nin the cause of peace, national independence and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nThe United Nations is approaching the final year of its\r\nfirst half century of existence. The most appropriate way\r\nfor us to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization is to help it act in a manner commensurate\r\nwith its global role and with the important, difficult and\r\ncomplex tasks set out by the new world situation. Since\r\nthe last session of the General Assembly, we have\r\nwitnessed immense and profound changes in the world as\r\na whole and in each region. Mankind is confronted by both\r\nopportunities and challenges. It is the task of each country\r\nand of the international community as a whole to realize the\r\nnoble aspirations of mankind, to overcome the obstacles to\r\nsettling global and pressing issues and to promote peace,\r\ncooperation and development.\r\nThe world panorama is full of contradictions. While\r\nthe threat of a destructive world war has been further\r\nchecked, ethnic, religious and territorial conflicts continue\r\nto persist or even multiply in a number of regions. Against\r\nthis disturbing backdrop, there have been some rays of hope\r\nthat certain conflicts in the world will be settled. The\r\nsuccess of the struggle waged by the South African people\r\nto abolish apartheid and establish a new united, democratic\r\nand non-racist State in South Africa constitutes a historic\r\nachievement for the South African people, the United\r\nNations and the world community. The Vietnamese\r\ndelegation warmly welcomes the delegation of the new\r\nSouth Africa to the General Assembly.\r\nIn the Middle East, encouraging progress has been\r\nmade, particularly between Palestine and Israel and between\r\nJordan and Israel, in the negotiating process and the search\r\nfor peace. These developments foster hopes of reaching a\r\njust and lasting peace in the region and of restoring the\r\nPalestinian people’s rights to self-determination and an\r\nindependent State in their own land.\r\nOver the past year there have been certain positive\r\ndevelopments in the world economy. In a number of\r\ncountries there have been signs of recovery. Globalism and\r\nregionalism have accelerated. Economic competition is\r\nacute and, in this context, the developing countries continue\r\nto bear innumerable disadvantages. A considerable number\r\nof these developing countries, however, are beset by\r\npoverty and backwardness; with every passing day millions\r\nof people are threatened by starvation. The developing\r\ncountries hope that, with the conclusion of the Uruguay\r\nRound and the decision to establish the World Trade\r\nOrganization, trade and investment will be expanded, thus\r\nstrongly enhancing international economic cooperation on\r\nthe basis of equality and mutual benefit.\r\nThey cannot, however, help being worried about\r\nattempts to use social and environmental issues as fuel for\r\nprotectionism. This will affect the common sentiments\r\namongst the world’s nations at a time when joint efforts\r\nare needed to solve global issues in the interests of the\r\ndevelopment and advancement of every nation and of the\r\nentire international community.\r\nIn an increasingly interdependent world in which\r\nglobalism is being strengthened, there is continuous\r\npressure to facilitate increased cooperation on the basis of\r\nequal and mutual benefit and to narrow the gap between\r\nthe level of development of the North and that of the\r\nSouth with a view to securing sustainable and lasting\r\npeace throughout the world.\r\nWe therefore welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiative in producing his \"Agenda for Development\".\r\nWe believe that through wide consultations between\r\nMember States we shall arrive at an agenda that responds\r\nto common demands and will ensure that the United\r\nNations plays an active role in facilitating economic and\r\nsocial development and the eradication of poverty in\r\nMember countries, thereby strengthening the\r\nOrganization’s important role in international economic\r\nrelations.\r\nWe share the view - expressed by many\r\ndelegations - that the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security and the promotion of development are the\r\ntwo paramount tasks of the United Nations. It is our\r\nhope that the role of the United Nations in the field of\r\ndevelopment will be strengthened in response to the\r\nexpectation of the countries of the world.\r\nThere is an increasingly irresistible trend towards\r\ndialogue and international and regional cooperation. In\r\nour view, international cooperation should be based on\r\nobservance of the principles of respect for independence\r\nand national sovereignty, non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of other States, mutually beneficial cooperation on\r\nthe basis of equality, the settling of disputes through\r\nnegotiation and without recourse to force or the threat of\r\nforce. In today’s world of increasing awareness of\r\nnational independence, respect for the right of nations\r\nfreely to determine their own course of development and\r\nto maintain their national identity is an essential condition\r\nfor the maintenance of peace and stability and for the\r\nstrengthening of international cooperation.\r\nBlockades, embargoes, sanctions and the imposition\r\nof conditions in international relations are relics of the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\npast. They run counter to the aspirations of peoples and to\r\nthe common trend and are contrary to international law.\r\nIn this connection, we wish to express our deep\r\nsympathy with the Cuban people in respect of their current\r\ndifficulties. We demand an end to the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba. We\r\ndemand also prompt and effective implementation of the\r\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly. We welcome\r\nthe joint communiqué recently signed by the United States\r\nof America and Cuba on the question of Cuban emigrés.\r\nWe hope that the two countries will continue their dialogue\r\nwith a view to settling other outstanding differences\r\nbetween them.\r\nAt a time of opportunities and challenges, of hope and\r\nfear, the United Nations bears, more than ever, a heavy\r\nresponsibility in regard to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Never before has the United Nations\r\nbeen directly engaged in dealing with so many hotbeds of\r\ntension throughout the world. Despite the Organization’s\r\nefforts, satisfactory solutions to the conflicts in Bosnia,\r\nSomalia and Rwanda have yet to be found.\r\nThe tendency to resort more and more to measures of\r\nenforcement and intervention to try to resolve intra-State\r\nconflicts has prompted legitimate concern among many\r\ncountries. We share the view that United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations should strictly observe the\r\nprinciples of respect for national sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other\r\nStates. We believe that the best way to secure the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflicts is to persevere with dialogue.\r\nLessons should be learnt from the successes and the failures\r\nof peace-keeping operations in recent times. This would\r\nhelp the United Nations the better to discharge the tasks\r\nthat the Member States as a whole have entrusted to it.\r\nThe complex world situation and the increasingly\r\nimportant role of the United Nations urgently require\r\nrestructuring of the Organization. In view of the growing\r\ndemocratization of international relations, we join those\r\ndelegations that are demanding reform to democratize the\r\nUnited Nations system. This would include an increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council to make it more\r\nrepresentative, more in keeping with the changes that have\r\ntaken place in the world and more transparent in its\r\ndecision-making processes. Revitalization of the work of\r\nthe General Assembly as the body most representative of\r\nthe interests of Member States is also necessary.\r\nThrough the convening of international conferences,\r\nsuch as the recent International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, the coming World Conference on\r\nWomen and the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nthe United Nations has clearly demonstrated its\r\ncommitment to the promotion of international cooperation\r\nin the resolution of global social issues of vital interest to\r\nall nations.\r\nI should like to mention in this important forum a\r\nparticularly significant coincidence of history. As the\r\nUnited Nations prepares to celebrate its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, the Vietnamese people are looking forward\r\nenthusiastically to commemorating the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof President Ho Chi Minh’s solemn declaration to the\r\nentire world of the birth of an independent, free and\r\ndemocratic Viet Nam. Only now, half a century after its\r\nbirth, is Viet Nam able to really concentrate its efforts on\r\nsocio-economic development.\r\nLocated in the most dynamic development zone in\r\nthe world, Viet Nam is fully aware of the danger\r\nconstituted by the widening gap between its level of\r\ndevelopment and that of other countries of the region. It\r\nhas therefore set itself the urgent task of rapidly\r\novercoming its state of poverty and underdevelopment in\r\norder to join the stream of progress and development in\r\nthe region and in the world. Viet Nam has embarked\r\nupon the path of reform and renewal in every sphere of\r\nits society’s life. The core of this reform and renewal is\r\nthe development of a multi-sector economy operating\r\nthrough a market mechanism and employing State\r\nregulation at the macro-economic level with a view to\r\nmaintaining the country’s socio-economic stability, along\r\nwith the step-by-step establishment of a state of law of\r\nthe people, by the people and for the people.\r\nThe reform and renewal process has achieved\r\nimportant initial results. The average annual growth rate\r\nof our gross national product for the three years from\r\n1991 to 1993 was 7.3 per cent; for the first six months of\r\nthis year, the rate rose to 8 per cent. Our international\r\neconomic cooperation and trade relations and foreign\r\ninvestment in our country have grown rapidly. Our\r\npeople’s living conditions have been improved. Further\r\nprogress has been made in the cultural, social, educational\r\nand health-care areas, especially regarding the care of\r\nchildren.\r\nAlong with economic reforms, Viet Nam has\r\ngradually carried out the reform and renewal of its\r\npolitical system in order to build a society in which the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nrights of each and every one will be increasingly ensured.\r\nWe continue to move forward in our efforts to establish a\r\nstate of law, perfect the legal system and undertake national\r\nadministrative reform. After the promulgation of the new\r\nConstitution in 1992, our National Assembly adopted a\r\nnumber of important laws, including the civil law, the\r\nlabour law, the land law, and the law on the promotion of\r\ndomestic investment.\r\nWith these achievements, Viet Nam is now shifting\r\ntowards a new stage in its development - that of the\r\nindustrialization and modernization of the country. This\r\nlong and arduous process has as its final objective a\r\nprosperous people, a strong nation and an equitable and\r\ncivilized society.\r\nTo create a favourable international environment for\r\nnational construction and development, Viet Nam has been\r\npursuing a foreign policy of openness, diversification, and\r\nmultilateralization of its relations, while carrying out our\r\ndesire to become the friend of all countries in the interest\r\nof peace, independence and development. We are pleased\r\nto note that our policy is developing in complete harmony\r\nwith the general trend throughout the world, and especially\r\nin South-East Asia - that is, the trend towards pursuing\r\npeace and cooperation in the interest of development, after\r\ndecades of war and confrontation. In its implementation of\r\nthis foreign policy, Viet Nam gives first priority to\r\nenhancing the relations of friendship and cooperation with\r\nneighbouring countries in the region, and to creating peace,\r\nstability, cooperation and development in South-East Asia.\r\nOur bilateral relations with each of the members of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and\r\nwith the Association itself, are experiencing rapid and\r\nsatisfactory growth, primarily in the economic and\r\ncommercial areas, particularly since Viet Nam became an\r\nASEAN observer in 1992. At the ministerial Conference\r\nof ASEAN held in Bangkok last July, the ASEAN Foreign\r\nMinisters unanimously supported Viet Nam’s full\r\nmembership in this Association. With the increased support\r\nof the ASEAN countries, Viet Nam is actively preparing to\r\ntake all the necessary steps to join this Association as a full\r\nmember. Viet Nam’s accession to ASEAN is in conformity\r\nwith the general trend towards responding to the interests\r\nof the countries of the region and reinforcing regional\r\ncooperation, especially in the economic and commercial\r\nareas, and at the same time facilitates the expansion of our\r\nrelations with other countries and international organizations.\r\nIn keeping with the new regional context, all 10\r\ncountries of South-East Asia recently participated, for the\r\nfirst time, in the Conference of foreign ministers of\r\nASEAN; an ASEAN Regional Forum, at which regional\r\nsecurity was discussed, was also held for the first time on\r\n25 July last in Bangkok. All this demonstrates the\r\ngrowing cooperation in South-East Asia, as well as the\r\nrobust movement towards the attainment of the common\r\ngoals of the region: peace, stability and security.\r\nIn order to ensure the peace, stability and\r\ndevelopment of each country and of the region as a\r\nwhole, Viet Nam is of the view that the countries of the\r\nregion should consolidate existing points of agreement,\r\nnarrow differences and settle disputes, including those\r\nregarding the Eastern Sea, through bilateral and\r\nmultilateral negotiations among those parties directly\r\nconcerned, without resorting to the use or threat of force.\r\nWhile waiting and working for a fundamental and durable\r\nsolution, all the parties concerned should restrain from\r\nany act that might further complicate the situation, and at\r\nthe same time strictly respect each country’s right of\r\nsovereignty on the continental shelf and in the exclusive\r\neconomic zones, in keeping with international law and\r\nparticularly with the 1982 United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea.\r\nWith regard to the Kingdom of Cambodia, Viet Nam\r\nardently wishes to see its neighbour become an\r\nindependent, peaceful, neutral, non-aligned country,\r\nmaintaining friendly relations with all countries. It is Viet\r\nNam’s policy to strengthen good-neighbourly relations\r\nwith the Kingdom of Cambodia and to respect the\r\nCambodian people’s right to self-determination. We\r\nconsider that all signatories to the Paris Agreement on\r\nCambodia are bound to scrupulously observe that\r\nAgreement, to refrain from interfering in that country’s\r\ninternal affairs and to actively contribute to the process of\r\nnational reconciliation and the restoration of peace and\r\nstability in Cambodia.\r\nIn the interest of maintaining and strengthening the\r\ntraditional friendly relations between Viet Nam and\r\nCambodia and of protecting the legitimate rights of the\r\nVietnamese residents who have been, for many\r\ngenerations, living in Cambodia, we wish to draw\r\nattention to the Immigration Law promulgated by the\r\nNational Assembly of Cambodia on 26 August 1994.\r\nCertain articles of that Law have given rise to some\r\nconcern. His Royal Highness King Norodom Sihanouk\r\nand the Royal Government of Cambodia share the\r\nlegitimate concern of the Government of Viet Nam and\r\nhave undertaken to avoid any regrettable consequences\r\nand agreed to begin negotiations with Vietnam soon to\r\nsettle this problem.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nThe lifting by the United States of the embargo\r\nimposed upon Viet Nam has opened up new prospects for\r\nbuilding and broadening multi-faceted cooperation between\r\nour two countries in the interests of the two peoples and in\r\nthe service of peace, stability, cooperation and development\r\nin the region and throughout the world.\r\nWe firmly believe that multilateral relations, especially\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations, are playing an\r\nincreasingly important role in international life. As we\r\nmove towards the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of our Organization, we shall\r\nbe reviewing all the activities of the past 50 years, drawing\r\nthe necessary lessons to enhance the capacity and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations system and to pursue\r\ntasks worthy of the confidence and expectations of the\r\npeoples of the world. For its modest part, Viet Nam will\r\nunceasingly strive to make positive contributions to the\r\ncommon cause of the United Nations for peace,\r\ndevelopment and social progress throughout the world.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Secretary of the General People’s Committee for\r\nForeign Liaison and International Cooperation of the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya, His Excellency Mr. Omar Mustafa\r\nMuntasser.\r\nMr. Muntasser (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): On behalf of my country and\r\nin my own behalf, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate\r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to the Presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. The fact\r\nthat you belong to our beloved continent, coming as you do\r\nfrom a country bound with my own by bonds of\r\nbrotherhood and relations of friendship and cooperation is\r\na source of added pride to us in your assumption of this\r\nhigh office. My delegation is confident that, familiar as\r\nyou are with the work of the United Nations, and with your\r\nextensive experience in the field of international relations,\r\nyou will be able to steer this session to a successful\r\nconclusion. I should also like to seize this opportunity to\r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation of your predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Insanally, for the wisdom he\r\ndisplayed, the efforts he made and the initiatives he took to\r\nreform the United Nations and enhance its role. Further, I\r\nwish to express our gratitude to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nthe Secretary-General, for his tireless efforts to strengthen\r\nour Organization so as to enable it to face the numerous\r\ncrises that beset the international community.\r\nThe international situation witnessed many\r\ndevelopments during the forty-eighth session. The will of\r\nthe people of South Africa has triumphed after a long\r\nstruggle and great sacrifices. It is indeed heartening to\r\nsee in our midst today the delegation of South Africa,\r\nrepresenting a united, democratic and non-racial country.\r\nBrotherly Yemen has survived its transient crisis and\r\nremains one united country, whose citizens are working\r\nwith more determination and greater expectations, to build\r\nthe modern State of Yemen. Along with these\r\ndevelopments, tangible progress has been recorded in the\r\nimplementation of the Peace Accord in Mozambique.\r\nMoreover, the artificial tension in the Korean peninsula is\r\nnow subsiding. We are hopeful that the difficulties\r\nrelating to the reunification of the Korean peninsula will\r\nbe overcome through dialogue to be entered into on equal\r\nfooting.\r\nSuch developments are a source of satisfaction and\r\nwe greatly welcome them. However, they do not mask\r\nthe gloomy points of the wider picture of the international\r\nsituation. Many disputes still await a solution. The\r\noutbursts of nationalist passions, ethnic chauvinism and\r\npower struggles in the absence of any power among the\r\npeople, have led to the outbreak of new regional conflicts.\r\nAlthough some of these conflicts are getting closer to a\r\nsolution, as is the case in Liberia, where the conflict is\r\nheading towards a permanent solution, the international\r\ncommunity must still support national reconciliation\r\nefforts in Afghanistan, overcome the setbacks to the peace\r\nefforts being undertaken in the Balkans, consolidate the\r\nrole of the United Nations in establishing peace in that\r\nregion and guarantee the legitimate rights of the parties to\r\nthe dispute there.\r\nThe international community is also called upon to\r\nrenew its efforts aimed at reaching a satisfactory solution\r\nto the problem of Cyprus. It must encourage peace talks\r\non Angola and support work towards a negotiated\r\nsolution in sisterly Somalia, in addition to demonstrating\r\nincreased solidarity to alleviate the tragedy of the\r\nRwandan people. It must also make more efforts to solve\r\nthe problem of Kashmir on the basis of bilateral\r\nagreements and the relevant United Nations resolutions in\r\nparticular.\r\nIn the interest of stability in the Persian Gulf region,\r\nmy country stresses the importance of the unity and\r\nterritorial integrity of Iraq, and calls for an end to all\r\ninterference in its internal affairs. We also consider that\r\nthe sanctions imposed on Iraq, which cause suffering to\r\nthe Iraqi people, should be lifted, since the reasons for\r\nthese sanctions are no longer valid. Their continuation\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\ncan only mean a grave injustice aimed at the destruction of\r\nthe Iraqi people and the extermination of large groups of its\r\npopulation.\r\nThe United Nations has adopted many resolutions on\r\nthe Question of Palestine, all of which acknowledge the\r\nright of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland\r\nand to exercise the right of self-determination. Although\r\nthe United Nations has repeatedly reaffirmed these\r\nresolutions for more than 40 years, the Palestinian question\r\nstill awaits a solution, the Palestinian people remain\r\ndisplaced and their rights are systematically and\r\ncontinuously violated. This proves that the so-called\r\nongoing peace process lacks the elements necessary for any\r\ncomprehensive settlement. This also shows that the\r\nresolution of the Palestinian question and the establishment\r\nof comprehensive peace in the Middle East cannot be\r\nrealized merely by returning Gaza back to its status as a\r\nmunicipality and adding Jericho to it, but must rather come\r\nabout through the liberation of all occupied Arab territories\r\nincluding the Syrian Golan and the acceptance of a\r\ndemocratic solution that would meet all the rights of the\r\nPalestinian people, including their right to return to their\r\nhomeland and establish their own independent State.\r\nA few months ago, we celebrated the historic victory\r\nof the people of South Africa. It is no coincidence that the\r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people is in many ways similar\r\nto that of the people of South Africa, and that many of the\r\nacts of heroism of both peoples echo each other. The\r\nsolution that made it possible to build a united, democratic\r\nand non-racial state in South Africa offers a model for\r\nresolving the question of Palestine through the\r\nestablishment in Palestine of a democratic non-racial State\r\nwith Al Quds as its capital, where Arabs and Jews can live\r\ntogether. This is the proper solution, without which it\r\nwould be impossible to reach a just and lasting peace that\r\nserves the interests of both Jews and the Palestinian Arabs.\r\nMr. Sinunguruza (Burundi), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe numerous changes witnessed by the world after\r\nthe cold war have created opportunities to build a more\r\nstable and secure world. However, the hopes of the\r\npeoples of the world for greater and better understanding\r\nand for wider cooperation have started to wane. The\r\nexperience of the past few years has caused deep concern\r\nregarding some developments. Some States have begun to\r\ntry to impose their control and to expand their hegemony,\r\nusing their power and influence in utilizing international\r\norgans to implement their plans, and using them,\r\nparticularly the Security Council, as a tool to punish those\r\ncountries which abide by their principles and adopt\r\nindependent policies and positions. This was the very\r\ncontext of the dispute between my country and France,\r\nBritain and the United States of America in what has\r\nbecome known as the Lockerbie crisis. This problem was\r\nraised, pushed arbitrarily through the Security Council,\r\nand dealt with under Chapter VII of the Charter, which is\r\nnot applicable in this case since Libya has not threatened\r\nanybody and has never acted in a manner that jeopardized\r\ninternational peace and security. The whole issue is\r\nmerely the suspicion that two Libyans may be connected\r\nto the Pan Am flight 103 incident.\r\nAware as it has been all along of the motivation\r\nbehind this entire issue, my country has shown sincere\r\nreadiness to cooperate in uncovering the truth and\r\ncircumstances of that incident. We have taken the\r\nnecessary judicial measures consistent with the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations and international law, with only one\r\nproviso, that they do not involve any violation of Libya’s\r\nsovereign rights.\r\nAlthough the Security Council was pushed into the\r\nadoption of resolution 731 (1992), Libya did declare its\r\nreadiness effectively to cooperate in the implementation\r\nof that resolution. In that respect Libya took practical\r\nsteps that were widely welcomed by numerous\r\norganizations, including the League of Arab States, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference, and the Non-Aligned Movement. It\r\nwas our hope that the three States concerned would take\r\nthat into consideration and respond positively to the\r\nrequests of Libyan authorities for cooperation in\r\ncompleting the investigation. However, the three States\r\nconcerned responded in an entirely different way. Instead\r\nof accepting the initiatives calling for dialogue and\r\nnegotiation, and showing flexibility in dealing with the\r\nother aspects of the crisis, by reconsidering Security\r\nCouncil resolution 748 (1992) with a view to lifting the\r\nsanctions imposed on the Libyan people, instead, they\r\nresorted to the Security Council once again and, using\r\ntheir influence, managed to persuade it to adopt resolution\r\n883 (1993), tightening the sanctions imposed by\r\nresolution 748 (1992).\r\nThe argument invoked by the three States concerned\r\nto justify maintaining the sanctions and the threat even to\r\ntighten them further, is that Libya has not complied with\r\nthe requirements of Security Council resolution 731\r\n(1992). And when these States are confronted with the\r\nfact that the Jamahiriya has really complied with these\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nrequirements, their officials, and particularly British and\r\nAmerican officials, answer with the words \"Libya knows\r\nwhat is required of her\". Officials in both countries have\r\nrepeatedly used this phrase to such an extent that we are\r\nconvinced that the aim behind the raising of the Lockerbie\r\nincident is not to uncover the truth and the circumstances\r\nof the issue but rather to achieve premeditated political\r\nobjectives. Indeed, if the aim had really been to bring\r\nLibya to comply with the requirements of resolution 731\r\n(1992), that aim has been fully realized. Libya has taken\r\nthe legal measures necessary to pinpoint responsibility for\r\nthe terrorist acts perpetrated against both American and\r\nFrench planes. Libya has requested the three States\r\nconcerned to cooperate in completing the investigation in\r\nthis respect. Libya has even invited neutral bodies to\r\nfollow it up and international and humanitarian\r\norganizations to monitor its fairness. My country has\r\ncooperated with the French judge in charge of the\r\ninvestigation aimed at determining responsibility for the\r\nexplosion aboard French UTA flight 772. Contacts in this\r\nrespect still continue. My country has also cooperated with\r\nthe Government of the United Kingdom in trying to\r\nuncover certain elements accused by the British\r\nGovernment of involvement in terrorist acts. To this end,\r\nseveral meetings were held between the Libyan and British\r\nsides. Today, we are very glad to see that negotiations\r\nhave already started between Britain and the political and\r\nmilitary wings of the Irish Republic Army (IRA) and that\r\nan agreement has been signed by the two parties. Now the\r\nleaders of the IRA are being received and welcomed at the\r\nhighest level in both London and Washington with a view\r\nto holding negotiations with a view to ending the dispute\r\nand all its side effects.\r\nLibya has condemned international terrorism in all its\r\nforms and declared its readiness to commit itself to\r\nwhatever measures are adopted by the international\r\ncommunity to combat this scourge. Libya has also severed\r\nall its relations with all groups and organizations suspected\r\nof being involved in terrorist acts. Libya has emphasized\r\nthat it will not allow its territory, citizens or institutions to\r\nbe used for such acts whether directly or indirectly. We\r\nhave declared our readiness to punish severely whoever is\r\nproved to be involved in any terrorist acts. Libya has also\r\ndeclared that there are no terrorist training camps on its\r\nsoil. It has repeated its invitation to the Security Council,\r\nor any international body mandated by the Council, to\r\nverify this. All these practical measures confirm the extent\r\nof my country’s seriousness in stamping out the\r\nphenomenon of international terrorism. This seriousness\r\nhas been reflected in the call by the Jamahiriya for the\r\nconvening of a special session of the General Assembly to\r\nbe devoted to the study of the causes and dimensions of\r\nthis problem and its support of the proposal to convene an\r\ninternational conference to define terrorism, including\r\nState terrorism, and the means to eradicate it in all its\r\nforms. It is State terrorism with which Libya is now\r\nbeing threatened at the hands of a State which is a\r\npermanent member of the Security Council. That State\r\nhas abducted Libyan prisoners of war from Chad and is\r\nnow training them and equipping them to undermine the\r\nsecurity and stability of Libya. This is the same terrorism\r\nto which Libya fell victim in 1973 when Israeli planes\r\nintentionally shot down a Libyan civilian airliner, killing\r\nall 108 passengers aboard; and also when the United\r\nStates of America in 1986 bombed Libyan cities while\r\npeople were asleep in their beds and caused great loss of\r\nlife and damage to property. Later it was revealed that\r\nthe acts used by that State as a pretext for its aggression\r\nwere unfounded.\r\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has spared no effort in\r\ntrying to resolve the dispute, including trying the two\r\nsuspects in the Pan Am flight 103 incident, although the\r\nmatter has been predetermined by the 1971 Montreal\r\nConvention which gives Libya the right to try the two\r\nsuspects itself. However, the refusal by Britain and the\r\nUnited States of America to abide by this Convention, to\r\nwhich they are both parties, has prompted Libya to seek\r\nother ways of holding the trial. Thus, Libya offered to\r\nresort to the International Court of Justice or to surrender\r\nthe two suspects to the United Nations office in Libya for\r\ninvestigation. Libya has also proposed that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations should establish a fact-\r\nfinding legal commission to verify the seriousness of the\r\naccusations, including carrying out a comprehensive\r\ninvestigation. Competent Libyan authorities referred the\r\nmatter to the basic popular congresses which constitute\r\nour legislative authority and they in turn made the\r\ndecision that they had no objection to letting the two\r\nsuspects stand trial before a fair tribunal to be agreed\r\nupon. Proceeding from this, my country declared its\r\nreadiness to enter into negotiations with the States\r\nconcerned under the supervision of the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations on the trial to be held in a place\r\nagreed to by all parties concerned where full guarantees\r\nwould be available to establish the truth, indeed the very\r\naim of Security Council resolution 731 (1992).\r\nRecently, new information on the American aircraft\r\nincident has been uncovered, including a book entitled\r\nTracking the Octopus by Coleman and Donald and the\r\nstatements by the manager of a Swiss electronics\r\ncompany. These new revelations obliterate the central\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nelement on which the accusations against the two Libyan\r\ncitizens was based. Despite all this, Libya maintained its\r\ncooperation in trying to identify all the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the incident. On this basis, Libya accepted the\r\nproposal of the Council of the League of Arab States\r\ncontained in its resolution 5373 of 27 March 1994. That\r\nproposal called for trying the two suspects by Scottish\r\njudges under Scottish law at the seat of the International\r\nCourt of Justice. Even after new information was revealed\r\nby the Palestinian citizen, Yousef Shaaban, before a\r\nLebanese Court, Libya did not hesitate to go ahead with the\r\ntrial and did not waver in its declared readiness to accept\r\nany verdict emanating from such a trial.\r\nThis, once again, underlines the fact that the Libyan\r\nJamahiriya has no objection to the trial of the two suspects.\r\nAll that Libya wants is for the trial to be fair and just, free\r\nfrom any emotional or media influences, and with the\r\navailability of all guarantees consistent with the norms of\r\nlegality and international law, which Libya has observed\r\nand applied. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) can\r\ntestify to this, since that Court has considered, over the past\r\n10 years, three cases to which Libya was a party. The ICJ\r\ndecided the case relating to the continental shelf between\r\nLibya and Tunisia, and both parties fully implemented the\r\nruling of the Court. The same happened in the case of the\r\ncontinental shelf between Libya and Malta; once again the\r\ntwo parties implemented the ruling of the International\r\nCourt of Justice. This year, the Court decided the territorial\r\ndispute between the Jamahiriya and Chad. Though the\r\nruling rejected Libya’s demands, the Jamahiriya did\r\nimplement it in a constructive spirit that was welcomed and\r\nappreciated by both the Security Council and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. This shows the extent of my country’s\r\ncommitment to and respect of international legality,\r\nsomething that great powers pay lip service to but never\r\napply. These States refuse even to appear before the ICJ,\r\nsince they believe in the legality of force and not the force\r\nof legality.\r\nMost international and regional organizations have\r\nrenewed their appeal to the three States to accept the\r\ninitiatives calling for dialogue and negotiation, with a view\r\nto reaching a peaceful settlement to the crises. Those\r\norganizations, including the 11th Ministerial Conference of\r\nthe States Members of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\r\n60th Session of the Council of Ministers of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, welcomed Libya’s\r\nacceptance of the Arab League’s proposal. This august\r\nAssembly, which includes all States represented in those\r\norganizations, is now called upon to show its appreciation\r\nof Libya’s position, Libya’s steps and initiatives and the\r\nproposals that we have accepted. It should call on the\r\nthree States concerned to show flexibility and enter into\r\ndialogue with the Jamahiriya with the aim of reaching a\r\npeaceful settlement to this problem. This Assembly is\r\nalso called upon to express its support of these demands,\r\nso that the Security Council will reconsider its resolutions\r\non the crisis and lift the unjust sanctions. It is absurd and\r\nignorant to depict the sanctions as being against the\r\nLibyan Government, because in Libya there is no\r\nGovernment as such. The power is in the hands of the\r\npeople, who now suffer the consequences of these\r\nsanctions - for example, the crash of a Libyan civilian\r\naircraft in 1992, leading to the death of all 157 civilians\r\naboard, as a result of the ban on spare parts.\r\nFurthermore, 1,622 people have been killed in car\r\naccidents, and 350 people, most of whom were children,\r\nold men and women died as a result of delays in moving\r\nthem abroad for medical treatment. These sanctions have\r\nalso caused economic damage estimated at $4.5 billion.\r\nThese damages are detailed in official document\r\nS/1994/921.\r\nBefore the Second World War, and following the\r\nend of that war, the Libyan people suffered and continue\r\nto suffer all sorts of pressure, troubles and pains. We\r\nhave been subjected to colonialism in its worst form: a\r\nFascism that wreaked havoc in our country, killing,\r\ndisplacing and exiling countless numbers of our citizens.\r\nAgainst our will, we had to be a theatre of war between\r\nthe colonial powers, a war that was fought on our soil\r\nand for which we were the fuel. That war’s mines are\r\nstill buried in our soil, in our farms and under our homes.\r\nFrom time to time, these mines explode and kill innocent\r\npeople. In previous sessions of this Assembly, my\r\ncountry has repeatedly called on the States concerned to\r\ncooperate with us in removing these mines. Today,\r\n7 October, coincides with the commemoration of the\r\nLibyan people of the 25th anniversary of the evacuation\r\nof the last Fascists who had settled in Libya and\r\noppressed its people. Once again I repeat my call and\r\nurge the States concerned to respond positively to the\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly, instructing them to\r\nprovide the necessary information on mines, give\r\ntechnical assistance in removing them, and pay\r\ncompensation for the losses they have caused. This may\r\nalso be a good opportunity to remind the imperialist states\r\nthat occupied our lands for over 40 years that we have\r\nnot forgotten the ruin and destruction they left behind.\r\nI should also like to announce that my country,\r\nthrough this Assembly and other forums, will seek to\r\ncompel colonialist states to pay fair compensation for the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nresources they have looted and the wealth and money they\r\nhave plundered from our country. The peoples of the world\r\nare called upon to adopt a historic resolution, through this\r\nOrganization, condemning colonialism and forcing former\r\ncolonial powers to compensate their former colonies, in\r\norder to prevent the re-emergence of colonialism and\r\nprevent the powerful from once more blackmailing and\r\noppressing the weak.\r\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya welcomes efforts aimed\r\nat enhancing security and cooperation in the Mediterranean\r\nregion. We voice our satisfaction with the initiatives whose\r\nobjective is to enhance economic, social, cultural and\r\nenvironmental cooperation in the region. Libya calls for\r\ntaking all measures necessary to remove all causes of\r\ntension in the area, especially through the withdrawal of\r\nforeign military fleets whose continued presence jeopardizes\r\npeace and security in the Mediterranean, which in turn are\r\nclosely linked to international peace and security. The\r\nArab Maghreb Union has achieved tangible progress on the\r\nroad towards economic integration among its countries and\r\ntowards the consolidation of the underpinnings of\r\ndevelopment in these countries. It has also opened new\r\nchannels of cooperation with organizations in the areas to\r\nwhich we belong both geographically and culturally. Libya\r\nwelcomes those steps and expresses the hope that the\r\nMaghreb Union will succeed in playing a similar role with\r\nits counterpart organizations on the other side of the\r\nMediterranean, beginning with the intensification of\r\ncontacts and meetings, as well as active dialogue with the\r\ninstitutions concerned, on a basis of equality and common\r\ninterests in a manner capable of responding to the concept\r\nof joint development and the collective responsibility for\r\nmaintaining peace and strengthening cooperation on the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean.\r\nIn view of the stability of the political system in the\r\nJamahiriya and its importance as an economic market, it\r\nwould be impossible to marginalize or ignore its role in any\r\ncooperation between the shores of the Mediterranean if\r\nsuch cooperation is achieve its objectives, at the forefront\r\nof which is serving the peoples of the region and achieving\r\ntheir prosperity.\r\nSome progress has been registered recently in the field\r\nof disarmament. This is a welcome development. Libya\r\nlooks forward to more international cooperation with a view\r\nto destroying nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as\r\nwell as other weapons of mass destruction. We look\r\nforward to the banning of the development, stockpiling and\r\nuse of all such weapons. My country also hopes that more\r\nefforts will be made to conclude a treaty on making Africa\r\na nuclear-weapon-free zone and the activation of the\r\ninitiative aimed at making the Middle East region free\r\nfrom weapons of mass destruction. The Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya is a party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty. We hope that the preparatory committee for the\r\n1995 review conference will, in its next session, reach an\r\nunderstanding that takes into consideration the concerns\r\nof all parties to the Treaty, especially as regards its\r\nextension. My country still has some difficulty in\r\naccepting an indefinite extension of the Treaty, because\r\nsuch an extension does not take into account several of\r\nour concerns, including the unavailability of credible\r\nsecurity guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon states.\r\nFurthermore, the area in which we live suffers from a\r\nsecurity imbalance, resulting from Israel’s acquisition of\r\nnuclear weapons and its non-adherence to the\r\nnon-proliferation regime. It has not acceded to the\r\nTreaty, nor has it signed a safeguard agreement with the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). That is\r\nwhy my country would like to emphasize that it is\r\nessential to address these concerns at the time of\r\nconsidering the extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\nin 1995.\r\nRespect for and protection of human rights is one of\r\nthe fundamental underpinnings of Libyan policy. This\r\nhas been demonstrated in various forms which included\r\nthe setting up of the International Committee for the\r\nQaddafi Human Rights Prize and the adoption of the\r\ngreen document on human rights and basic human\r\nfreedoms. Libya is determined to support and contribute\r\nto all international efforts aimed at guaranteeing the\r\neffective enjoyment of human rights. We thus welcome\r\nthe conclusions of the Vienna Conference, which\r\nconstitute a step on the road to the support and\r\nenhancement of human rights. That human rights\r\nConference rejected the manipulation of human rights and\r\ntheir use as a tool of political pressure. This universally\r\nadopted principle must be respected, especially by States\r\nthat selectively raise problems related to human rights.\r\nThe international community must stand up to any\r\nattempt by any State or group of States to exploit human\r\nrights as a means of interfering in the internal affairs of\r\nother States. It must also oppose any attempt by any\r\nState or group of States to distort the principles and\r\nvalues of other peoples or to promote the principles and\r\nvalues of such States or groups of States as the only\r\nproper values that should be embraced by all peoples.\r\nThe international community’s hopes for a secure\r\nand stable world cannot be realized without addressing\r\neconomic problems, particularly in the developing\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\ncountries, where economies continue to face difficulties as\r\na result of the aggravation of the problem of external debts,\r\nthe application of protectionist trade policies, the imposition\r\nof harsh conditions for their importation of advanced\r\ntechnology, the deteriorating prices of raw materials and the\r\ncontinued attempts to impose new taxes, such as the carbon\r\ntax, which could hurt not only the economies of the oil-\r\nexporting States but also those of oil-importing countries.\r\nWe believe it is impossible to solve these problems\r\neffectively unless the international community deals\r\nseriously with and puts an end to the erroneous practices\r\nthat continue to characterize international economic\r\nrelations. Such practices include coercive economic\r\nmeasures, such as the freezing of assets and the\r\nconfiscation by certain developing countries of the property\r\nof a number of developing countries, including my own.\r\nSuch measures constitute an impediment to growth, aside\r\nfrom the fact that they run counter to the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, norms of international law and the\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly.\r\nThe General Assembly is the natural place for\r\nMember States to exercise their rights and express their\r\nviews on the initiatives aimed at reforming the United\r\nNations. In the course of the last session, we followed with\r\nkeen interest everything that was achieved in this regard.\r\nMy country expresses its satisfaction at the progress made\r\ntowards revitalizing the activities of the General Assembly\r\nand the establishment of an effective working relationship\r\nbetween the Assembly and the Security Council. We hope\r\nfuture efforts will result in an increase in the membership\r\nof the Security Council based on equitable geographical\r\ndistribution. To our mind, this process must be\r\naccompanied by measures to remove obstacles to the proper\r\nfunctioning of the Council, such as the privilege of veto\r\npower, and improvements in its working methods so that it\r\ncan function in accordance with the principles of the\r\nCharter and, eschewing double standards, deal consistently\r\nwith all issues.\r\nIf we examine past Security Council practices we shall\r\nfind that while the Council showed interest in trying to\r\nsecure commitment to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\r\nit has turned and continues to turn a blind eye to Israel,\r\nwhich has not acceded to the Treaty and actually possesses\r\n200 nuclear warheads. Furthermore, the Security Council\r\nhas insisted on invoking Chapter VII of the Charter in cases\r\nto which it is not applicable, while at the same time failing\r\nto invoke Chapter VII in the case of Israel, despite its\r\ndefiance of United Nations resolutions and its continued\r\noccupation of the territories of States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. The Council kept silent on the Israeli\r\nrefusal to withdraw from southern Lebanon and on the\r\nmassacres perpetrated against the Palestinians, such as the\r\none in Hebron’s Al-Haram Al-Ibrahimi Al-Sharif - the\r\nMosque of Abraham - where, in an act of terrorism, a\r\nfanatical Zionist settler, trained in an American camp,\r\nkilled over 50 Palestinians while they were praying.\r\nMy country believes that, in the context of reforming\r\nthe Security Council, the Council must be neutral and\r\ngive none of its members a chance to dominate it or steer\r\nit towards serving its own interests, as has been the case\r\nin so many instances, the latest of which was the\r\nCouncil’s granting of permission to one of its permanent\r\nmembers to invade an independent State Member of the\r\nUnited Nations, the Republic of Haiti. It has been said\r\nthat the objective of that action was to restore democracy\r\nand protect human rights. If this were true, why was\r\nthere no such action in the past, when the people of that\r\ncountry were suffering under the yoke of a repressive\r\nregime, subjected to the most vicious violations of their\r\nhuman rights? What happened was a flagrant violation of\r\nthe Charter, an act of aggression against the inviolability\r\nof an independent country. It also establishes the\r\ndangerous precedent of giving permission to a State,\r\nunhappy about waves of immigrants reaching its shores,\r\nto occupy the land where the immigration originates.\r\nLibya cannot afford to overlook this invasion or\r\nkeep silent about it, first, as a matter of principle and,\r\nsecondly, because Haiti has a special place in our history.\r\nForty-five years ago Haiti played a decisive role in a\r\nmatter of interest to us. Its deciding vote won the\r\nadoption of the General Assembly resolution on Libya’s\r\nindependence.\r\nAt this time next year, the celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations will begin. While\r\ndevelopments in recent years have revealed some\r\nweaknesses in some of the United Nations organs’\r\nhandling of dispute settlement and crisis management, this\r\ncannot be attributed to the Charter but, rather, to the\r\ntendency by certain Powers, insisting that their approach\r\nalone should be adopted, to impose their hegemony on the\r\nhandling of international matters.\r\nThis question should be the focus of attention in the\r\nnext session because it will mark the demise of the old\r\norder and the building of the new order that will replace\r\nit. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya intends to participate\r\nwith others in building this new order to ensure that it\r\nwill be an order based on justice and equality that\r\nrespects peoples’ political and economic options, secures\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nfull commitment to international law and full respect for the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and stands up to those who\r\nwould push the United Nations towards the fate of the\r\nLeague of Nations. The new order we need is one that\r\nenhances and protects human rights and eradicates poverty,\r\nsuffering, division, conflicts, disputes and wars. It must be\r\nan order in which no State seeks to impose its hegemony\r\nand abuse its influence, an order that supports the\r\nsettlement of disputes among States by peaceful means, not\r\nby arbitrary and coercive means. We need a new order\r\nunder whose umbrella all peoples can look optimistically to\r\na future where security, peace and stability prevail.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Solomon Islands, His Excellency the Honourable\r\nFrancis Joseph Saemala.\r\nMr. Saemala (Solomon Islands): I wish, first of all,\r\nto warmly congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session,\r\na responsibility he will discharge effectively with the\r\nproven diplomatic skills with which he has served his\r\ncountry and his region so well. I take this opportunity also\r\nto applaud the good work and leadership of his predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, who presided over\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nIt is appropriate that on the eve of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of this Organization we enter a new era in\r\ninternational relations, an era untainted by the cold-war\r\npolitics that held peace and positive change hostage for too\r\nlong. Opportunities now abound for change and lasting\r\npeace. This new era demands that all Member States take\r\na global view of how the Organization can best meet the\r\nobjectives set out in the Charter.\r\nPresident Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin\r\ndemonstrated this new hope for peace at the opening of the\r\ngeneral debate, when both addressed the General Assembly\r\non the same day instead of on consecutive days, as was the\r\nold practice. In a spirit of cooperation, these two world\r\nleaders described their intent to reduce their nation’s\r\nstockpiles of nuclear and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. But disarmament must start from the heart.\r\nAnd I hope that this is the case with the step these two\r\nPresidents have taken towards the betterment of all\r\nhumankind.\r\nToday, we would recall that peace and hatred come\r\nfrom within people - the mirror of a nation, the image of a\r\nregion and the living treasure of the global community. In\r\norder to build a peaceful and safe world for future\r\ngenerations, our resolve to reduce nuclear and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction must lie within the hearts of\r\nour leaders and policy makers throughout the world. We\r\nmust therefore seize this opportunity and work together to\r\nbuild a better world.\r\nIn this regard, Solomon Islands welcomes the\r\nvarious peace initiatives that continue to bring hope to the\r\nworld community. The noble efforts of President\r\nMandela to chart a new direction for South Africa must\r\nbe commended. In his first address as the first President\r\nof the new democratic South Africa, President Mandela\r\nacknowledged the efforts of the international community\r\nin this way:\r\n\"The universal struggle against apartheid and its\r\nfinal dismantlement was not an act of charity arising\r\nout of pity for the majority of South African people\r\nbut an affirmation of our common humanity.\"\r\nProgress towards a lasting peace in the Middle East\r\nhas renewed the hope of the international community for\r\nstability in that region. The parties involved in these\r\nnegotiations deserve our sincere acclaim and praise and\r\nour continuing support. Replacing guns with meaningful\r\nhandshakes often takes leaders beyond their physical\r\nnature and leads them to resort to their spiritual\r\nmindsets - a dimension that is often ignored but which is\r\nan essential ingredient in a recipe for conflict resolution.\r\nThe cease-fire in Northern Ireland has changed\r\npeople’s perception of the impossibility of the simple\r\nreality of living without guns and bullets. These are\r\ntelling achievements for our times, and their roots are\r\nembedded in the human spirit of love and kindness.\r\nDespite United Nations interventions to restore\r\nintra-State and international peace and security, the world\r\nis still riddled with trouble spots and endangered by\r\nhuman-induced threats such as the potential impact of\r\nclimate change and sea-level rise. We witness with\r\nhorror the human suffering in Rwanda, Somalia, Angola,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and Haiti. Solomon Islands\r\ncalls on the parties concerned to lay down their arms and\r\nresort to non-violent means of negotiating peace. True\r\nand real peace has to spring from within the warring\r\nparties, replacing animosity.\r\nClose to home in the Solomon Islands is the five-\r\nyear-old crisis on Bougainville, a province of Papua New\r\nGuinea. It spilled over into Solomon Islands and caused\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\na rift between the two countries. Nevertheless, through a\r\nprocess of mutual dialogue between the National\r\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea and the Bougainville\r\nRevolutionary Army, several important agreements have\r\nbeen signed. These include the Honiara commitments to\r\npeace, the cease-fire agreement and the historic\r\npeace-keeping agreement on Bougainville. The role of the\r\nSolomon lslands Government in this conflict has been\r\nconciliatory, facilitating peace negotiations amongst the\r\nparties concerned. Solomon Islands supports the\r\nBougainville Peace Conference, expected to be convened on\r\n10 October. This reflects our commitment to restoring\r\npeace and normalcy on Bougainville.\r\nSolomon Islands pledges its support and commitment\r\nto the ideals of the United Nations. We believe it to be the\r\nonly world body capable of maintaining world peace and\r\nsecurity. Solomon Islands shares the views of New\r\nZealand’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs and Trade, the Right Honourable Don McKinnon,\r\nwhose statement at the general debate provided six\r\nimportant management issues that should be addressed\r\nwhile conducting United Nations peace-keeping operations.\r\nThere is no doubt in my mind that all of us want an\r\neffective United Nations - an Organization that meets the\r\nobjectives it sets out to achieve, an Organization whose\r\nCharter is valid because its actions are reliable.\r\nSolomon Islands welcomes the current initiatives\r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General in reforming the\r\nOrganization and supports proposals made by other\r\nMember States for further reforms. These reforms, in our\r\nview, must also reflect the needs of small island developing\r\nStates such as my own, particularly the need to remove \"the\r\nfloor\" to enable Member States to meet their financial\r\nobligations. Some want to pay their assessed annual\r\ncontributions but do not have the capacity to do so; hence\r\na relative and fair formula should be worked out.\r\nIn his report (A/49/1) on the work of the Organization,\r\nthe Secretary-General has identified peace, the economy,\r\nthe environment, justice and democracy as the five\r\ninterlocking pillars of development. These will provide the\r\nfoundations for the kind of development that will ensure\r\nhuman progress.\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" paved the way forward from\r\nthe dark ages of the cold war; the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development was a\r\nreawakening initiative to save planet Earth; the Second\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights sought to establish\r\nuniversal rights for all peoples throughout the world\r\nirrespective of race, creed, political affiliation or sex; the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nsaw the need to control the soaring world population,\r\nwhich now stands at 5.7 billion; and next year the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and the World\r\nConference on Women will address poverty,\r\nunemployment, social integration and the empowerment\r\nof women to take their rightful place in society. These\r\nare efforts of Member States committed to the noble\r\ncause of securing a peaceful, safe and sustainable world\r\nto live in. To achieve these noble goals, an effective\r\nglobal partnership is of paramount importance.\r\nTechnology has made the world’s smaller economies\r\nbecome more interdependent.\r\nAgenda 21, the outcome of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, made a\r\nspecial case for small island developing States because of\r\ntheir peculiar vulnerabilities. The response to this call\r\nwas the convening of the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates in Barbados in April this year. The passage from\r\nRio to Barbados, at least for small island developing\r\nStates, was a Programme of Action outlining national,\r\nregional and international actions. Our collective support\r\nis needed to implement this. If we agree that\r\ndevelopment takes many forms and requires different\r\nresponses, then our task will be made easier if we act\r\ntogether. Solomon Islands fully supports the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action and calls on the members of the\r\ninternational community to honour their commitments as\r\nspelled out in Agenda 21. The successful implementation\r\nof the Programme of Action will depend on these\r\ncommitments.\r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nin his \"Agenda for Peace\" report to the Security Council,\r\nstressed that cooperation with regional arrangements and\r\norganizations could be of great benefit to Member States\r\nif their activities were consistent with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter and governed by the provisions\r\nof Chapter VIII. Some of those bodies have already\r\ngained observer status at the United Nations. This shows\r\nthe useful role these arrangements and organizations can\r\nplay in international affairs. Therefore, the strengthening\r\nof regional arrangements and organizations that are\r\nworking closely with the United Nations is a critical\r\nissue.\r\nIn this regard, Solomon Islands strongly supports the\r\ndecision by the South Pacific Forum to seek United\r\nNations observer status at the forty-ninth session of the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nGeneral Assembly. We acknowledge with gratitude the\r\nrole of Australia, the current Chairman of the South Pacific\r\nForum, in guiding this initiative through the United Nations\r\nsystem on the Forum’s behalf. We thank Member States\r\nthat have expressed support for this call and invite others to\r\ndo likewise.\r\nAs a member of the South Pacific Forum and the\r\nMelanesian Spearhead Group, Solomon Islands endorses the\r\nForum Communiqué issued following the meeting of the\r\ntwenty-fifth South Pacific Forum held in Brisbane,\r\nAustralia, this year. We are a party to the Joint Declaration\r\non Economic and Trade Cooperation signed in Solomon\r\nIslands this year between Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and\r\nSolomon Islands. Solomon Islands calls upon the\r\ninternational community to support our regional\r\narrangements and organizations from which our strength for\r\ncollective action is derived and which are responsible for\r\nour flow of communication.\r\nForestry and fisheries resources remain my country’s\r\nmain income earners. The Solomon Islands Government is\r\ngravely concerned about the unsustainable utilization and\r\nmanagement of these resources and has taken steps to\r\nensure sustainable harvesting and conservation measures\r\nand to form a national policy. We are party to Agreements\r\nreached in Brisbane at the meeting of the South Pacific\r\nForum to cooperate on a wider basis in order to ensure\r\nsustainable development of fisheries and forestry resources\r\nin our region. Because of the fragility of our ecological\r\nsystem, our biodiversity resources, including forestry and\r\nfisheries and other marine living resources, are threatened.\r\nIt is heartening to note that after 12 years of\r\nnegotiations the world will witness the coming into force of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in\r\nNovember this year. However, we strongly feel that further\r\ncooperation is still needed from the distant water fishing\r\nnations regarding sustainable harvesting of straddling fish\r\nstocks and highly migratory fish stocks, including\r\nnon-targeted species. We therefore urge distant-water\r\nfishing nations to come to grips with the need to complete,\r\nas soon as practicable, negotiations on a legally binding\r\nagreement on proper conservation and management and\r\nsustainable utilization of high seas fisheries resources.\r\nEducation is a priority sector in my country. It is a\r\nkey to the effective management of my country’s natural\r\nresources as well as a means of achieving the advancement\r\nof women to take their rightful place in society. There is\r\na direct link between the education of women and\r\npopulation control. We welcome the outcome of the Cairo\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nand look forward to the World Conference on Women, to\r\nbe held in Beijing in 1995.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development also has\r\nprofound implications for capacity-building, institutional\r\nstrengthening and the transfer of technologies and their\r\nappropriate use. Human-centred activities, including\r\ntourism development and skills training, are important for\r\nthe development of human resources. We endorse the\r\n1994 Human Development Report of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for its emphasis on\r\nhuman-centred development, an approach that has positive\r\nripple effects in solving other social problems.\r\nDrug trafficking and the criminal activities\r\nassociated with it worry us in the Pacific, and we are not\r\nalone in this. We need international cooperation to stop\r\nthe movement of illegal drugs from one region to another.\r\nSolomon Islands supports the South Pacific Forum\r\nposition that the non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) should be\r\nextended indefinitely. However, we would like to see\r\nfirm commitments from the nuclear-weapon States to\r\nshow the world a leadership role in reducing their\r\nstockpiles. We also wish to see a rigid review\r\nmechanism set up to be a safeguard instrument as an\r\nintegral part of the indefinite extension agreement.\r\nIt is encouraging to hear the United States, the\r\nRussian Federation and China speak in support of the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty and the comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty. It is hoped that a level of harmony between the\r\nNPT, the comprehensive test-ban treaty and the cut-off\r\nconvention may be maintained to enhance the elimination\r\nof weapons of mass destruction in an integrated manner.\r\nSolomon Islands urges the post-Forum dialogue\r\npartners that have not yet done so to ratify the South\r\nPacific nuclear-free zone Treaty. Nuclear testing in the\r\nPacific is not part of our vocabulary.\r\nConsistent with our belief in a nuclear-free world,\r\nwaste dumping in the Pacific Ocean is not to be\r\nencouraged. We strongly oppose those who may violate\r\nthis natural rule. We also firmly oppose the\r\ntransshipment and transboundary movement of plutonium\r\nin the South Pacific region.\r\nWe need to see some further movement towards a\r\nspeedy implementation of the Matignon Accords. In this\r\nregard, we request the Government of France and the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nterritorial authorities to increase their efforts to achieve real\r\neconomic and social rebalancing.\r\nSolomon Islands welcomes the move to formulate an\r\nagenda and proposals to promote trade and investment\r\nbetween the United States and the Pacific Islands, which\r\nwill be the subject of a meeting at the East-West Centre in\r\nHawaii later this year.\r\nApart from the other vulnerabilities that plague small\r\nisland developing States, the potential impact of climate\r\nchange and rising sea levels poses a great threat to Pacific\r\nislands. There is overwhelming scientific evidence pointing\r\nto the danger we now face.\r\nIn this regard, Solomon Islands supports the Alliance\r\nof Small Island States, which has submitted to next year’s\r\nConference of the parties to the Convention on Climate\r\nChange an additional protocol aimed at securing a reduction\r\nof the emission of greenhouse gases to the 1990s level by\r\n2005, a protocol to which the industrialized countries would\r\nbe obliged to be parties.\r\nWe in Solomon Islands firmly believe that the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan has much to contribute to the\r\nwork of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in\r\nterms of international cooperation and development. This\r\nRepublic, with a population more than 58 times that of my\r\nown country and highly technologically advanced, deserves\r\nto be admitted as a Member of the United Nations. The\r\nfull participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the\r\nimportant work of the United Nations would be an\r\naffirmation of the Charter and of democracy and a\r\nmanifestation of the human spirit’s pursuit of a better\r\nquality of life for humankind. In my Government’s view,\r\na move as noble as the admission of the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan would be not an obstacle to reunification, but a\r\ncatalyst in the process. In our view, the Secretary-General\r\nshould use his good offices to encourage the establishment\r\nof a committee specifically to facilitate and/or work\r\nprogressively towards the re-entry of the Republic of China\r\nto membership of the United Nations.\r\nPresident Ernesto Samper Pizano of the Republic of\r\nColombia, speaking from this podium, described Colombia\r\nas\r\n\"a country searching for peace because it so loves\r\nlife.\" (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nforty-ninth session, Plenary Meetings, 5th meeting, p.\r\n8)\r\nWe in Solomon Islands, too, love life very much, and our\r\nsearch is for a better quality of life, which should flow\r\nfrom the wise and sustainable development of our\r\nresources.\r\nCollectively, however, our search must be for world\r\npeace so that we can live up to our dreams, visions and\r\nGod-given potential. I believe that the answer to the\r\nproblem of bringing about world peace lies in our own\r\nhearts, not in the barrels of guns or military might. Here,\r\nin this great world Assembly, let our hearts enkindle a\r\nnew torch to shine on the new path to world peace, from\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and beyond.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand, His\r\nExcellency Squadron Leader Prasong Soonsiri.\r\nMr. Soonsiri (Thailand): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Thailand, I extend warmest\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire on\r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session. I am confident that he will provide\r\nthe General Assembly with the leadership to guide the\r\nsession to a successful conclusion.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to Ambassador\r\nInsanally, the General Assembly’s President at its\r\nforty-eighth session. My delegation very much\r\nappreciates his untiring and effective leadership and his\r\ndedication to the work of this body. Under his\r\npresidency, the General Assembly had an eventful year,\r\nand its role was enhanced in ways which were beneficial\r\nto the Organization.\r\nThailand joins the rest of the international\r\ncommunity in congratulating the Government and people\r\nof South Africa on having established a united,\r\ndemocratic and non-racial country. They have shown us\r\nthat compromise is possible and that even the most\r\nlong-standing and bitter of conflicts can be resolved\r\npeacefully. This achievement is due entirely to the\r\nexceptional vision, courage and pragmatism of the\r\ncountry’s leaders - in particular, President Nelson\r\nMandela and Executive Deputy President F.W. de Klerk.\r\nTribute must also be paid to the United Nations, and in\r\nparticular to the Special Committee against Apartheid, for\r\nits contributions to the positive changes in South Africa.\r\nThere is another bright spot giving all of us hope for\r\na more peaceful world. Since the Thai Government has\r\nlong supported the Middle East peace process, the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\ntermination of the state of war between Jordan and Israel,\r\nannounced in Washington in July this year, following last\r\nyear’s historic agreement between Israel and the PLO, gives\r\nall of us reason to rejoice. We hope that it will lead to\r\nfurther agreements on \"other tracks\" acceptable to all\r\nparties concerned, so that a durable peace in the Middle\r\nEast may finally be achieved.\r\nWe also welcome the positive developments\r\nconcerning the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and\r\nhope that dialogue and negotiation between the parties\r\nconcerned will eventually result in that part of the world\r\nenjoying lasting peace and stability.\r\nHowever, in spite of the promising outlook for\r\ninternational peace and security, there remain political and\r\nmilitary conflicts of both global and regional magnitude.\r\nIt is therefore imperative that countries continue unfailing\r\nefforts to secure a stable and peaceful international\r\nenvironment. As a first step in this direction, the\r\ninternational community could support and cooperate in\r\nefforts towards comprehensive reform and total\r\nrevitalization of the United Nations to enable the\r\nOrganization to meet the new challenges of today’s world\r\nand to assist Members efficiently in their peaceful\r\nendeavours.\r\nThailand pledges its continued support for the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals in \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nThese constitute an innovative and practical framework for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and\r\ndeserve serious consideration by all Member States.\r\nIn South-East Asia, realizing the need to ensure a\r\nsecure and peaceful international environment, the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) took the\r\nlead in promoting political and security dialogues and\r\nconsultations in the Asia-Pacific region by initiating the\r\nestablishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).\r\nDesigned to be a high-level consultative forum on political\r\nand security matters, the ARF held its first meeting in\r\nBangkok on 25 July 1994, after the twenty-seventh ASEAN\r\nministerial meeting. Nineteen ministers from countries in\r\nthe Asia-Pacific region and from the European Union\r\nattended this historic meeting to discuss political and\r\nsecurity cooperation issues, such as the latest developments\r\non regional situations, and decided to carry out some\r\npractical confidence-building measures applicable to the\r\nAsia-Pacific region.\r\nAs Chairman of the first ARF meeting, Thailand is\r\npleased with the results of the meeting and its\r\nachievements. In particular, Thailand is grateful for the\r\nkind cooperation it received from all countries concerned.\r\nSince the success of this first meeting, the ARF has\r\nbecome a viable forum for the promotion of trust as well\r\nas political and security cooperation within the\r\nAsia-Pacific region. The ARF has also demonstrated its\r\npotential to make substantive contributions towards the\r\nUnited Nations efforts at preventive diplomacy and at\r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nIn other words, the ARF got off to a good start.\r\nThailand is fully aware that the first meeting of the ARF\r\nin Bangkok was only the beginning. For this reason,\r\nThailand views the inter-sessional activities at various\r\nlevels among officials from ARF countries as necessary\r\nfor the ARF’s continued success. These activities could\r\nhelp the ARF find its future direction and enable it to\r\nbecome more efficient and productive.\r\nPolitical and military security are but one aspect of\r\nthe bigger picture facing us. As we search for a new\r\ninternational order based on a common set of principles\r\nand values, we need to change our way of thinking. We\r\nalso need a new culture of development cooperation and\r\nnew definitions of the notions of security and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe winds of change have begun to sweep across the\r\nglobe. We are now witnessing the creation of major\r\nlandmarks of international consensus-building. In 1992,\r\nthe Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit set a new stage for\r\nglobal partnership on the environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Last year (in Vienna), the World\r\nConference on Human Rights was held, producing a\r\nworld programme of action. Last month in Cairo we\r\nwitnessed the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment. Next year in Copenhagen, the World\r\nSummit for Social Development will be held. This\r\nSummit will serve as a bridge between this year’s\r\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo and\r\nnext year’s Fourth World Conference on Women in\r\nBeijing. It also presents a unique opportunity for the\r\ninternational community to respond, on a global level, to\r\nurgent human and social concerns that place people at the\r\ncentre of the development process.\r\nThe Thai Government accords special importance to\r\nsocial development. In light of this, we have established\r\na social cabinet dedicated to formulating policies and\r\nfinding solutions to a number of pressing social problems.\r\nWe have also organized a joint committee comprising\r\nmembers of the private sector and of Government and\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nchaired by the Prime Minister. Its mandate is to oversee\r\nefforts to alleviate the social problems that beset a growing\r\neconomy, such as those being experienced by my country\r\nand others in the region.\r\nThailand has participated and will continue to\r\nparticipate actively in all global deliberations. These\r\nconferences create new paradigms of international conduct\r\nwhich give rise to the various comprehensive global plans\r\nof action. They have also started the new process of\r\nredefining the notions of security and development.\r\nSecurity in this final decade of the twentieth century\r\ngoes well beyond the familiar concepts of old. It must\r\ninvolve people - how they live and how they exercise their\r\nchoices. It should be security with a human face, because\r\nit must deal directly with political, economic, environmental\r\nand social aspects of our lives in a comprehensive manner.\r\nDevelopment, as pointed out by the Secretary-General,\r\nmust be seen in its five interlinked dimensions: with peace\r\nas the foundation; the economy as the engine of progress;\r\nthe environment as a basis for sustainability; justice as a\r\npillar of society; and democracy as good governance. My\r\ncountry shares these perceptions and supports their premises\r\nas envisioned by the Secretary-General.\r\nIt is with this awareness that Thailand approaches its\r\nwork on the international agenda for development. Such an\r\nagenda should reflect and indeed promote self-reliance as\r\nwell as interdependence among Member States. There is\r\nno doubt that development is primarily a national\r\nresponsibility. Yet, it is also a shared responsibility of the\r\ninternational community. It is our firm belief that the\r\ndevelopment effort of any State in today’s world must be\r\nsupported by a conducive international environment, based\r\non free and fair trading practices. The completion of the\r\nUruguay Round and the creation of the World Trade\r\nOrganization now hold out the prospect of providing\r\nsignificant benefits to the world economy.\r\nA United Nations agenda for development should not\r\nbe given any less importance than the agenda for peace.\r\nThese two intertwined issues must be the core of any effort\r\nto strengthen the role and activities of the United Nations\r\nas we approach the next century.\r\nTogether with the \"An Agenda for Peace\", \"An agenda\r\nfor development\" should serve as an instrument for the\r\ncoordination of activities within the United Nations, as well\r\nas between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, and other non-governmental organizations. It\r\nshould be an instrument to create unity of purpose, at\r\nboth the policy and operational levels, within the\r\nOrganization. The United Nations cannot be a strong\r\nforce for peace unless it is also a strong force for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe United Nations remains humanity’s best hope\r\nfor creating a more desirable world - a world with a\r\nconscience, a world which recognizes that humans\r\neverywhere, young or old, strong or weak, are at the\r\ncentre of our communal and individual efforts. To this\r\nend, I should like to reaffirm Thailand’s commitment to\r\nthis vision, which cannot be fulfilled without the active\r\nparticipation of Member States. Thailand will do its part\r\nin contributing to this end. We hope that other countries\r\nwill also chip in with their fair share of contributions. A\r\nworld united by this vision and this unity of purpose will\r\nsurely be a better place for us all and, more important, for\r\nour children and grandchildren.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): Several\r\nrepresentatives have asked to speak in exercise of the\r\nright of reply. I remind members that, pursuant to\r\ndecision 34/401, statements in exercise of the right of\r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention\r\nand to 5 minutes for the second, and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMrs. Albright (United States of America): I am\r\nobliged to reply to the speech by the representative of\r\nIraq, which attacked the United States, misrepresented the\r\nfacts about Iraq’s lack of compliance with Security\r\nCouncil resolutions and insulted the United Nations.\r\nThe issue here is not the United States record, but\r\nIraq’s record. Despite the claim of its representative at\r\nthe outset of his speech to respect international law, Iraq\r\nis in simultaneous violation of more Security Council\r\nresolutions than any Member State in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations. It has sought to evade, ignore and\r\nnegotiate away its obligations. The only approach it has\r\nnot tried is compliance.\r\nFor more than three years, Iraq has failed to account\r\nfor Kuwaiti and other prisoners and missing persons. It\r\nhas yet to return all of the Kuwaiti property it stole. It\r\ncontinues to destroy systematically one of the world’s\r\nrichest ecological regions and to suppress brutally the\r\nhuman rights of its citizens, all in contravention of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 687 (1991) and 688 (1991).\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nIt is the height of cynicism for the Iraqi Government\r\nto appeal to the General Assembly on behalf of the\r\nsuffering Iraqi people. This is the same Government\r\nwhich, years before \"ethnic cleansing\" was employed in\r\nBosnia, erased hundreds of Kurdish villages from the map\r\nof Iraq and used chemical weapons against its own\r\ncivilians.\r\nThe Security Council cares about the Iraqi people\r\nmore than the Government of Iraq does. Iraq rejected the\r\nimplementation of resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991),\r\nwhich would have helped feed ordinary Iraqis, not because\r\nthe United States or anyone else imposed additional\r\nconditions, but because Iraq treated those resolutions, like\r\nall others, not as binding international law but only as the\r\nstarting point for negotiations. Iraq continues to request\r\nsanctions Committee approval for import of luxury goods.\r\nNone of Saddam’s family is hungry, and his dwindling\r\nnumber of supporters still enjoy imported liquor and\r\ncigarettes. The Government of Iraq refuses to do more to\r\nhelp its people precisely because it knows that their\r\nsuffering is the only Iraqi argument the world community\r\nviews with sympathy.\r\nIraqi cooperation on weapons of mass destruction is\r\ngrudging and incomplete. It has never revealed details\r\nabout its past biological-weapons programme, and it is\r\nseeking to reactivate its network of equipment supply for\r\nthese programmes. There is no reason to believe Iraq’s\r\npromises in this regard. The Security Council can rely only\r\nupon an extensive long-term monitoring system, adequately\r\ntested over an adequate period of time.\r\nA change in Iraqi behaviour in all of these areas is the\r\nprogramme of the Security Council, ratified in its\r\nresolutions. This, and no other, is the programme of the\r\nUnited States.\r\nThis morning’s speech was a classic attempt to define\r\nwhite as black. Iraq is not the victim. Iraq is the\r\naggressor, the initiator of the conflict. It has never\r\naccepted the simple fact, agreed upon by virtually every\r\nnation represented here, that its invasion of Kuwait was\r\nillegal from the beginning.\r\nWe had hoped that the Iraqi representative today\r\nwould have addressed this core issue. Instead, he found\r\nhimself still incapable of mentioning the word \"Kuwait\" in\r\npublic, still unable to address the core issue of the conflict:\r\nKuwait’s sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and\r\nborders.\r\nYesterday’s statement by the Revolutionary\r\nCommand Council threatening action against the United\r\nNations if the Security Council does not meet Iraq’s\r\ndemands was a giant step backwards in meeting the\r\nfundamental criterion of Security Council resolution 687\r\n(1991): that the Council be assured of Iraq’s peaceful\r\nintentions. This morning in New York we heard\r\npromises of compliance; from Baghdad we hear threats\r\nand defiance. The two statements may be dressed\r\ndifferently - one as a lamb, one as a wolf - but they\r\nconvey the same fact: that the Government of Iraq\r\ncontinues to believe that the use of force and threats\r\nagainst its neighbours is legitimate.\r\nEven as we listened to placating words from the\r\nIraqi representative, the facts on the ground were quite\r\ndifferent. Iraq is moving elements of two of its premier\r\nRepublican Guard divisions, the Hammurabi and Al-Nida\r\narmoured divisions, from northern and central Iraq\r\nsouthwards, close to the Kuwaiti border. They are\r\ndeploying with ammunition and other logistical supplies.\r\nI do not believe any member of this Assembly could\r\ncharacterize these facts as evidence of peaceful intentions.\r\nOn the contrary, these military facts belie everything we\r\nhave just heard from the representative of Iraq.\r\nLet it be absolutely clear to the Iraqi Government\r\nthat a repetition of its past mistakes will be met by my\r\nGovernment with the same resolve as before.\r\nMoreover, seeking to precipitate a crisis will not\r\nencourage the Security Council to speed the lifting of\r\nsanctions; it will have exactly the opposite effect.\r\nMr. Hoxha (Albania): I feel obliged to respond, in\r\nexercise of the right of reply, to the statement made here\r\non 5 October by the representative of Greece, who\r\nalleged that the Greek minority in Albania is denied\r\nhuman rights as it was during the previous, Communist\r\nregime. I would respond by citing the following facts.\r\nIn free and fair elections held during the last two\r\nyears, the Greek minority cast 49,000 votes - that is, 1.03\r\nper cent of the total number of voters. Article 26 of the\r\nconstitutional law on fundamental rights and freedoms,\r\nadopted by the Albanian Parliament on 31 March 1993,\r\nstipulates that\r\n\"Individuals belonging to minorities shall enjoy,\r\nwithout discrimination and with equality before the\r\nlaw, fundamental human rights and freedoms. They\r\nmay freely express, preserve and develop their own\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic identity, teach\r\nand be taught in their mother tongue and associate in\r\norganizations and associations to protect their interests\r\nand identity\".\r\nThat provision has been fully implemented in practice.\r\nWith regard to the Greek minority, I would mention some\r\nimportant aspects of its implementation, such as the\r\neducational system in the Greek language. It comprises 85\r\nschools at all levels including university, 46 classes of\r\nwhich have fewer than 10 pupils, whereas the basic rule\r\nthat applies in the country requires that classes should have\r\nnot less than 20 students. The Government’s decision on\r\neducation dated 22 August 1994 increases the opportunity\r\nfor, and offers the possibility of, education in the mother\r\ntongue for minority people living in areas of mixed\r\npopulation. It took the Greek Government only one day to\r\ndescribe that decision as a restriction of the right to\r\neducation of the Greek minority in Albania.\r\nAllow me to point out that the overall integration of\r\nthe Greek minority in all spheres of life in Albania is\r\nalready an established fact. The Greek minority is\r\nrepresented in parliament by two members from its own\r\nparty and four others from other parties; in the executive\r\nbranch by cabinet ministers, high officials and ambassadors;\r\nand in the judiciary by judges in the\r\nconstitutional court and other low-level courts.\r\nIn the local government, the Greek minority is\r\nrepresented by 13 chairmen of communes, 159 councillors\r\nof district councils and 32 councillors of civic councils and\r\nso on. There are Greek newspapers, several hours of radio\r\nbroadcasts in Greek and its own cultural and political\r\norganizations.\r\nSince the establishment of the democratic regime, the\r\nGreek minority enjoys the right to travel freely to Greece\r\nand elsewhere.\r\nDuring the Hoxha communist regime, many people\r\nwho attempted to cross the barbed-wired border were killed.\r\nIn contrast to the previous regime, when all churches were\r\nbanned, now, thanks to the democratic regime, churches are\r\nbuilt and the liturgy is given in Greek in all villages\r\ninhabited by minority people, as witnessed by various\r\nobservers and missions from Greece and other countries\r\nand from different international organizations.\r\nAs regards the trial of five Albanian citizens of Greek\r\norigin, constantly referred to by the Greek Government, and\r\nagain by its representative at this session, I should like to\r\nmake clear that the defendants were charged with\r\ncollusion with the secret services of Greece. The court\r\nsentenced them for smuggling several hundred firearms in\r\nan organized manner, for recruiting and sending Albanian\r\ncitizens of Greek nationality to Greek military schools\r\nwithout the knowledge of the Albanian Government, of\r\ngathering secret military information and of illegal\r\npossession of weapons.\r\nThe Albanian delegation is ready to provide any\r\ninterested country with the dossier containing pertinent\r\nmaterials confirming such activities. It is appropriate here\r\nto emphasize that the guilt of the defendants has never\r\nbeen questioned, whether in the resolutions or in the\r\nrecourse mentioned by the Greek delegation or in any\r\nother reports.\r\nGreece, whose State or quasi-State organs appear to\r\nbe involved in the findings of this trial, has reacted\r\nstrongly in all international institutions. Prejudging the\r\ntrial, the Greek Government began its campaign long\r\nbefore the opening of the trial, trying to influence the\r\nverdict of the district court of Tirane. On the other hand,\r\nthrough a series of pressure and other retaliatory actions,\r\nsuch as the massive maltreatment and expulsion of 70,000\r\nAlbanian emigrants working in Greece and the blocking\r\nof the 35 million ECUs that the European Union allocated\r\nto Albania to assist in its development, the Greek\r\nGovernment has attempted to compel the democratic\r\ngovernment to violate the recently adopted democratic\r\nlegislation on the separation of powers and has intervened\r\nto suspend the trial. This is a hostile act, unacceptable to\r\nany country.\r\nAs to the report of Mr. Andres Zeplinsky, to which\r\nthe representative of Greece referred, I would say that\r\nthere is no official report drafted by that person. The\r\nonly existing document entitled \"Report of the trial\r\nmonitoring in Tirane\" - distributed at the meeting of the\r\npermanent committee of the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Vienna on\r\n19 September 1994, reads as follows:\r\n\"The trial was open and attended by many\r\njournalists and observers from Greece and different\r\ncountries.\"\r\nEven in this document, there is no evidence of any\r\nreservation concerning the charges or the innocence of the\r\nfive defendants.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nRegarding, the allegation that the defendants were\r\ntortured during the investigation process, I would like to\r\ndraw attention to the fact that the High Commissioner for\r\nNational Minorities of the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, Mr. Van De Stoel, met with the\r\ndefendants on a one-to-one basis without the presence of\r\nthe Albanian authorities. In his briefing to the permanent\r\ncommittee in Vienna, Mr. Van De Stoel said that none of\r\nthe defendants had complained about their treatment in\r\nprison. The above-mentioned document of the CSCE also\r\nstates that \"the Albanian judicial system has made\r\nconsiderable progress since independence\".\r\nConcerning the question of the Albanian immigrants\r\nin Greece, Albanians have always appreciated the\r\ngenerosity of the Greek people. However, it must be\r\npointed out that the stance of the Greek Government is\r\nquite different from that of the Greek people and violates\r\nthe relevant internationally-recognized standards.\r\nI must stress that the Greek Government has failed to\r\noffer a solution to the legalization of the status of the\r\nAlbanian immigrants despite Albania’s insistence that it\r\nwishes to help solve this problem.\r\nWith regard to economic assistance, I have not much\r\nto add since the Greek representative left no room for doubt\r\nabout the position of Greece, which is already well known,\r\nnamely that Greece persists in blocking the assistance of\r\nthe European Union to Albania. Nevertheless, I must add\r\nthat it is difficult for the Albanian people to understand\r\nhow Greece could block the generous aid of the taxpayers\r\nand of the Governments of the European member States\r\nonly to serve its nationalistic ambitions.\r\nIt is regrettable that the Greek Government continues\r\nto distort the truth about the large Albanian minority living\r\nin Greece from time immemorial and in its own lands. The\r\nreference to the Chams as collaborators with the Nazis is\r\nbut an attempt to justify the massacre against the Cham\r\npeople in 1944 and 1945 when many of them were forcibly\r\nexpelled and sought refuge in Albania. Neither the former\r\nGreek authorities nor the present Government have allowed\r\nthem to reclaim their property.\r\nIn his statement, the Greek representative did not\r\nexplain why Greece insists on denying the existence of the\r\nAlbanian minority in Greece. I would recommend that he\r\nat least consult the last report of the British Helsinki\r\nHuman Rights Group of May 1994 regarding the situation\r\nof the Albanian Macedonian and Turkish minorities in\r\nGreece to see how far behind Greece is, as compared to\r\nAlbania, in abiding by the commitments deriving from\r\ninternational documents on minority rights.\r\nDespite the current difficulties, my country continues\r\nto hope that Greece will respond positively to Albania’s\r\nopen invitation to an unconditional dialogue for we are\r\nconvinced that the crisis in the relations between the two\r\ncountries can and ought to be resolved through dialogue.\r\nOur commitment to this end, as stated last week by the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Albania, will be strong and\r\nconsistent.\r\nFinally, I would like to say that the presence of\r\nAlbania in the family of democratic nations has been\r\ndecided by the free vote of the Albanian people. No\r\nnationalism whatsoever will succeed in bringing about a\r\nshift in its orientation towards full integration into Europe.\r\nPrince Sisowath (Cambodia) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): This afternoon, Mr. Nguyen Manh Cam,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Republic of\r\nViet Nam stated that he was concerned over the new\r\nCambodian law on immigration.\r\nMy delegation has the honour of informing the\r\nAssembly that this law was adopted by a very large\r\nmajority in the National Assembly of Cambodia, a\r\nsovereign State that emerged from the elections in our\r\ncountry, which were supervised by the United Nations.\r\nThe law reflects the concerns of the Cambodian\r\npeople, responds to the current situation and is applied\r\nuniformly to all foreigners without discrimination. Like\r\nany law, the law on immigration will enter into force only\r\nwhen the text relating to its application has been drawn\r\nup. The text will take into account the higher interests of\r\nCambodia as well as the concerns expressed by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam.\r\nMy delegation can give every assurance that there\r\nwill be no decision taken for mass expulsions of\r\nforeigners. Any measure to implement the law and the\r\nregulations relevant thereto will be subject to joint\r\nconsideration by the countries concerned, among others\r\nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The Prime Minister\r\nof the Kingdom of Cambodia, His Highness Prince\r\nSihanouk, has sent a letter to his Vietnamese counterpart\r\noffering to send a group of experts to negotiate on the\r\nproblem of Vietnamese residents in Cambodia.\r\nAs regards the question of human rights, I should\r\nlike to inform the Assembly that our Constitution has\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nbeen drawn up in strict conformity with the\r\nrecommendations formulated in the Paris Agreements of\r\nOctober 1991 and in the Conventions signed by the\r\nNational Supreme Council on behalf of the Kingdom of\r\nCambodia.\r\nMr. Al-Qaysi (Iraq): The representative of the United\r\nStates exercised her right of reply in respect of the\r\nstatement made this morning by my Deputy Prime Minister.\r\nShe alleged that our statement attacked the United States,\r\nmisrepresented the facts about Iraq’s lack of compliance\r\nwith Security Council resolutions and insulted the United\r\nNations. Evidently, the representative of the United States\r\nwas repeating the same accusations that she levelled against\r\nmy country in the periodic reviews of the Security Council,\r\nthe last of which was held on 14 September 1994.\r\nIt is quite obvious to me that the statement of the\r\nrepresentative of the United States is an open attempt to\r\ndraw my delegation into a rhetorical exchange, an attempt\r\nwhich I shall resist.\r\nFacts are facts. The statement of my Deputy Prime\r\nMinister this morning presented to the General Assembly a\r\nfactual account which we are prepared to prove - an\r\naccount that even American newspapers say is true. I\r\nwould refer those who wish to verify that fact to this\r\nmorning’s issue of the Washington Post. The United States\r\nis in fact the permanent member of the Security Council\r\nthat, in violation of the Charter, is blocking the\r\nconsequences of Iraq’s implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nI wonder, therefore, whether calling in the General\r\nAssembly for the correct implementation of its commitment\r\nto the Charter by a Member State can be characterized as\r\nan insult to the General Assembly.\r\nOne would think, to listen to the statement of the\r\nrepresentative of the United States, that we in Iraq should\r\nnot only be accountable before the United States for what\r\nwe say, but we should also be accountable for what we do\r\nnot say. The representative of the United States says that\r\nthe issue here is not the record of the United States, but the\r\nrecord of Iraq. I disagree. The record that is at issue in\r\nour statement is the record of the members of the Security\r\nCouncil, notably that of one or two permanent members\r\nwhen they block the correct process of the implementation\r\nof commitments under the Charter.\r\nIn our view, we are entitled, in accordance with the\r\nclear-cut obligations set forth in the Charter, to ask the\r\nGeneral Assembly what we should do. Although these\r\nvery resolutions were drafted by the United States itself,\r\nthey are not being implemented - not because the Council\r\ndoes not want to implement them, but because the United\r\nStates does not want them to be implemented.\r\nAs for the statement of the representative of the\r\nUnited States to the effect that the facts on the ground\r\nwere quite different from what we stated in our statement,\r\nand the allegation that there were troop movements, let us\r\nreflect. An allegation is an allegation. Before it is\r\nproven, it remains only an allegation. If we are to base\r\nconclusions on allegations, then it would mean, as seems\r\nquite clear from the statement of the representative of the\r\nUnited States, that even the movement of troops within\r\nState boundaries is not an act of peaceful intention.\r\nWhen the representative of the United States talks\r\nabout statements that are emanating from Baghdad, let her\r\nbe fair and equitable, and acknowledge for once that\r\nblocking the correct process of the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions which Iraq has implemented\r\nfor so long, and perpetuating the suffering of our whole\r\nnation, certainly results in frustration and anger. Are we\r\nnot even allowed to express our frustration and anger,\r\naccording to the representative of the United States?\r\nTo conclude, let me repeat that facts are facts.\r\nCommitments under the Charter are clear. The rights and\r\nobligations of Member States under the Charter are clear.\r\nWe are talking about the present; we are not talking about\r\nthe past. We are not here to play worn-out records\r\nsimply for the sake of not allowing the correct process of\r\nimplementation to continue.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 October 1994\r\nIt is a fact that the United States is the permanent\r\nmember of the Council that is blocking the implementation\r\nof the provisions of resolution 687 (1991) in favour of\r\nIraq - the very resolution that it drafted itself. I fail to see,\r\nin the reply of the representative of the United States,\r\nanything that refutes what we said in our statement this\r\nmorning.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
