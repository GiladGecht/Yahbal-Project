(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Kennedy A. Simmonds, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nMr. Kennedy A. Simmonds, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis, His\r\nExcellency the Right Honourable Mr. Kennedy Simmonds,\r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Simmonds (Saint Kitts and Nevis): Once again\r\nI am proud and honoured to have the opportunity to address\r\nthis assembly of nations and to convey to representatives\r\nfraternal and cordial greetings from the Government and\r\npeople of Saint Kitts and Nevis. The convening of the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United\r\nNations provides the Governments of all Member States\r\nwith an important opportunity to reaffirm their\r\ncommitment to the cause of peace, democracy and the\r\npursuit of a higher quality of life for our peoples.\r\nI wish to join other representatives by extending\r\nwarmest congratulations from the Government of Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis to you, Mr. President, on your election to\r\npreside at this session of the General Assembly. I assure\r\nyou of my Government’s continued support and\r\ncooperation.\r\nAllow me, Sir, to thank the outgoing President, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, for the astute and most\r\nable manner in which he conducted and guided the affairs\r\nof this body during its forty-eighth session despite\r\nunprecedented trials and numerous challenges. His\r\nresolve and his successes give credence to his\r\ncommitment to the planting of seeds of cooperation and\r\ngoodwill in every corner of the globe to ensure that our\r\nchildren and grandchildren may feast on harvests of\r\npeace, equality, freedom and democracy.\r\nThe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, has faced many problems of great\r\ncomplexity during the past year. I wish to congratulate\r\nhim on the outstanding manner in which he has been\r\ncarrying out the mandate of the Organization.\r\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis shares the\r\ncommitment to democracy, respect for human dignity and\r\nthe protection of human rights. Our people enjoy the\r\n1\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\neffective workings of the democratic process and the\r\nsafeguards provided by its institutions. We are determined\r\nto do all that we can, in our time, to ensure that future\r\ngenerations too will be able to exercise their democratic\r\nfreedoms in an atmosphere of political stability.\r\nThere is an ever-increasing thirst for democracy\r\nthroughout the world. In our hemisphere, military regimes\r\nhave been giving way to democratically elected\r\nGovernments.\r\nNowhere has this process been more dramatic than in\r\nHaiti, where, in 1991, the people, in free and fair elections\r\nunder the keen scrutiny of the international community,\r\nchose Jean-Bertrand Aristide as their President. For almost\r\nfour years the will of the people of Haiti and the resolve of\r\nthe international community have been callously frustrated\r\nby the military, who usurped and have held on to power.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is in full agreement with the\r\nresolute action taken by the United States, with the support\r\nof the international community, to ensure compliance with\r\nSecurity Council resolution 940 (1994). The multinational\r\nforce has been carrying out its work with dedication,\r\nprofessionalism and restraint. While there have been some\r\nuntoward incidents, we must not be deterred. We must be\r\nprepared to stay the course for the benefit of the people of\r\nHaiti and for the growth of stable democracy in this\r\nhemisphere.\r\nThe process of establishing democracy will not end\r\nwith the return of President Aristide; it will have just\r\nbegun. In order to support the process, it is absolutely\r\nessential that the international community be ready to\r\nmobilize significant financial and technical resources to\r\nensure the rebuilding of Haiti’s economy and institutions -\r\ninstitutions destroyed by decades of neglect and\r\nmismanagement. Saint Kitts and Nevis stands ready to\r\nassist in the long and arduous task of helping the Haitian\r\npeople rebuild their economy.\r\nFor many years the international community struggled\r\nto bring democracy to the majority of the people of South\r\nAfrica. Today South Africa can be held up as a beacon of\r\nhope and a testament to the triumph of democracy. Last\r\nyear my delegation welcomed the announcement of the\r\nholding of non-racial and multi-party elections - something\r\nfor which my Government had been calling since joining\r\nthis Organization 11 years ago. We have successfully and\r\nemphatically closed the final chapter of the brutal and\r\nunjust system of apartheid, and a new and democratic South\r\nAfrica has emerged from its ashes.\r\nHowever, despite the successes, the new South\r\nAfrica is still on the threshold of unprecedented\r\nchallenges. The journey is long and arduous, but the\r\ncountry’s leaders and its people have a wonderful\r\nopportunity to right historical wrongs while at the same\r\ntime charting a new and purposeful course in their future.\r\nThe amalgamated voice of the people of South Africa has\r\nbeen heard, not only within that country but the world\r\nover. They have put their faith in the democratic process.\r\nAs South Africa sails the fresh and often tumultuous\r\nwaters of representative democracy and attempts to\r\ninstitutionalize social justice, St. Kitts and Nevis reiterates\r\nits commitment to join with the international community\r\nto give that country and its people the requisite support to\r\ndevelop lasting democratic and social institutions to\r\nensure that democracy does work and is seen to work for\r\nevery single citizen.\r\nThe contrasting realities of our world are quite real\r\nand apparent. Whenever we believe that we have solved\r\none major problem, another presents itself elsewhere.\r\nThis notwithstanding, we can all be pleased at the current\r\nmovement towards peace under way in the Middle East.\r\nNot long ago the prospect of peace in any form seemed\r\npractically impossible. However, today the peace process\r\nseems to be gaining a firm foothold in that region. The\r\ninternational community must be ready to give unreserved\r\nsupport to that process and afford it more durable\r\nmechanisms for success.\r\nMy Government welcomes the consolidation of\r\npeace and the efforts at cooperation between the\r\nGovernment of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization. No one could have predicted that so much\r\nwould have been possible, and in so short a time. The\r\nrapidly changing face of Middle East politics augurs well\r\nfor the overall peace process, quality of life and stability\r\nof the entire region. In this spirit, my delegation applauds\r\nthe joint Declaration officially ending the state of\r\nbelligerency between the State of Israel and the\r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan. This historic event marks\r\nyet another bold and positive step on the road to ensuring\r\na lasting peace in the Middle East. My Government calls\r\nupon the countries in the Middle East to give peace a\r\npractical chance.\r\nAs prospects for peace continue to flourish in the\r\nMiddle East, the tranquillity of the Gulf region is once\r\nagain being threatened by an Iraqi troop build-up near the\r\nKuwait border. It is time for the people of Kuwait to feel\r\nsecure within their own borders. It is time for full\r\ncompliance by Iraq with Security Council resolutions\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\npertaining to the aggression against Kuwait. It is time for\r\nKuwait nationals detained in Iraq to be returned to their\r\nhomeland. It is time for Iraq to pursue peaceful policies\r\nwith its neighbours. Once again the Government of\r\nSt. Kitts and Nevis urges the Government of Iraq to respect\r\nthe finalization of the demarcation of the boundary between\r\nKuwait and Iraq, which was accomplished by the Iraq-\r\nKuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission on\r\n20 May 1993, and to respect and abide by Security Council\r\nresolution 833 (1993), which guarantees the inviolability of\r\nthe boundary between the two States. It is the fervent hope\r\nof the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis that international\r\nsupport for this resolution will act as a deterrent, both now\r\nand in the future, against conflict between Kuwait and Iraq\r\nand will at the same time help enhance stability and\r\nsecurity in the region.\r\nThe constantly changing realities of the present world\r\nsituation call for Member Governments to harden traditional\r\nattitudes while making genuine attempts to search for\r\npragmatic solutions requiring different and unprecedented\r\napproaches and compromises. It was against this backdrop\r\nthat at the last session of the General Assembly my\r\nGovernment called upon the warring factions in the\r\nYugoslavian conflict to come to the negotiating table.\r\nWe note with great satisfaction that the leaders of\r\nCroatia and Bosnia and Herzergovina have managed to\r\narrive at a peaceful settlement of disputes. However, my\r\nGovernment abhors the wanton murder, \"ethnic cleansing\"\r\nand systematic persecution of innocent people which still\r\ncharacterize the brutal conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThese atrocities and the flagrant and consistent violation of\r\nhuman rights are an affront to everything we as human\r\nbeings hold sacred. The international community must\r\ncontinue to express its just indignation at the atrocities in\r\nthis arena of conflict. At the same time, we must pursue\r\nall initiatives to find a just and lasting solution, preferably\r\nat the negotiating table.\r\nLast year my delegation commended this body for its\r\ntireless efforts to keep the international community from the\r\nbrink of nuclear warfare and called upon all countries\r\nsignatories to the Treaty on non-proliferation to continue to\r\nabide by it and to urge those who had not yet become\r\nparties to it to do so. We repeat this plea today. We also\r\nlook forward to an indefinite ban on all nuclear testing.\r\nI must reiterate, however, that we should not stop\r\nthere, but should aim also for the non-proliferation of all\r\nweapons, including chemical, biological and conventional.\r\nIn this regard, St. Kitts and Nevis also supports the\r\nmoratorium on the export of land-mines, and goes even\r\nfurther by calling for a ban on their manufacture as well\r\nas their export. Land-mines continue to cause tremendous\r\nmisery and untold hardship for many populations world-\r\nwide long after conflicts have ended. In most cases the\r\nvictims of these land-mines are poor farmers and innocent\r\nchildren.\r\nIt is our sacred and solemn responsibility as world\r\nleaders to ensure a safe world for our nation’s children.\r\nMy delegation therefore congratulates the United Nations\r\non its consistent efforts to fulfil its humanitarian missions\r\nin the many different theatres of tragic suffering\r\nworld-wide. The humanitarian catastrophe which has\r\nbeen unfolding in Rwanda threatens to destabilize the\r\nfragile economic and political balance of its neighbours.\r\nThe scope and scale of this human disaster,\r\nunprecedented in the history of modern-day Africa,\r\nshould catapult us to seek a peaceful end to the crisis.\r\nReports on the revolting policy of \"ethnic cleansing\" and\r\nindiscriminate massacres of women and children strike a\r\nfamiliar, mind-wrenching note in our collective psyche.\r\nAlthough its resources are minuscule, St. Kitts and\r\nNevis could not fail to make a financial contribution to\r\nthe United Nations relief effort in Rwanda. We must act\r\ndecisively to mobilize more resources from every possible\r\nsource to intensify the relief effort in that tragic country.\r\nWe, the Members of the United Nations cannot\r\npamper our consciences with pious speeches on what the\r\nUnited Nations ought to do to alleviate the suffering,\r\nwhile at the same time rendering the Organization\r\nimpotent by refusing to give it the necessary financial and\r\nmaterial capabilities it so desperately needs to carry out\r\nits functions more effectively.\r\nThe United Nations is being called upon with greater\r\nfrequency to respond to a greater variety of conflicts,\r\nsuffering and development needs. If the Organization is\r\nto be able to respond effectively, we must evaluate from\r\ntime to time not only our resources, but the way in which\r\nwe manage those resources, and ensure that there is\r\ngreater accountability in such management. In short, the\r\nUnited Nations, recognizing the responsibilities entrusted\r\nto it by the international community, must be more\r\naccountable to its Members. What we are suggesting,\r\ntherefore, is a more balanced relationship predicated on\r\nthe principles of responsibility and accountability. The\r\ndelegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the creation\r\nof the Office of Internal Oversight Services; its creation\r\nis not an end in itself, but a means to ensure that there is\r\ngreater accountability within the Organization.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nWe must remain cognizant of the fact that the\r\nfundamental sovereignty of all States, large or small, is\r\nrespected equally by the United Nations. If necessary, the\r\nUnited Nations will protect the rights of the small against\r\nthe power of the large. It has institutionalized the rights of\r\nsmall and micro States to exist and to coexist with the big\r\nand powerful nations. All independent States, therefore,\r\nirrespective of their size and population, are equal under\r\ninternational law. Every effort should be made, therefore,\r\nto enable small States to participate more fully in the day-\r\nto-day decision-making process of the United Nations. One\r\nway to achieve this is through more equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation within the Secretariat, and I appeal for this\r\nto be implemented.\r\nAnother way in which the United Nations can be made\r\nmore globally inclusive is by bringing more Members into\r\nthe fold. Last year, my Government called upon the United\r\nNations to begin the process that would lead to the ultimate\r\nre-admission of the Republic of China in Taiwan into the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMy Government stands firmly behind that appeal and\r\nwe repeat this appeal here today. The Republic of China\r\nin Taiwan continues to adhere to the Charter of the United\r\nNations and to govern itself by the principles of\r\ninternational and humanitarian law. It has proven\r\nrepeatedly that it is a country committed to peace,\r\ndemocracy and development, not only for its 21 million\r\npeople, who are entitled to proper representation\r\ninternationally, but for all peoples, that their quality of life\r\nmay be improved. The Republic of China in Taiwan is a\r\nmajor international player in commerce, trade and\r\ndevelopment assistance, and would make a significant\r\ncontribution to the work of the United Nations.\r\nI would now like to turn our attention to the question\r\nof sustainable development and small States, and to\r\ncommend quite highly the efforts of the United Nations in\r\nbringing the reality and concerns of small island developing\r\nStates to the forefront of international focus.\r\nThe Declaration of Barbados is a step in the right\r\ndirection. It recognizes that small island developing States\r\nhave special and peculiar needs. We, in small island\r\ndeveloping States have been saying this for a long time.\r\nOur very survival as a people and as independent States is\r\ndependent on the sustainable development of our human\r\nresources and the maximization of our scarce material\r\nresources. These limited material resources are under\r\nconstant and severe stress despite our efforts.\r\nAlthough we recognize the Conference in Barbados\r\nas a giant step for small island developing States, the\r\ndiscussion must be taken much further, beyond\r\nconference halls and into communities, and translated into\r\npractical tangible benefits. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, for\r\ninstance, over the past ten years we have been engaged in\r\nprojects and programmes whereby we seek to create a\r\nsound and pragmatic balance between economic and\r\nsocial development, on the one hand, and environmental\r\nprotection on the other.\r\nHowever, existing problems and innovative attempts\r\nby small island developing States to improve their\r\nstandard of living very rarely receive consistent support\r\nfrom the developed world. Micro States like Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis are being called upon to prove their viability\r\nwithin the international community. The irony lies in the\r\nfact that when we manage to raise our standard of living\r\nto a decent level, the international community withdraws\r\nor reduces its support under the pretext that our GNP per\r\ncapita is too high.\r\nI do not believe that we should have to reiterate the\r\nvulnerability index of small States like mine. Although\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis does not produce or use any\r\nsignificant amount of material to damage the ozone layer\r\nor contribute to coastal erosion and rising sea levels, we\r\nare among those which suffer most as a result of their\r\nimpact. Small island States like mine suffer greatly from\r\nenvironmental and natural disasters, yet we lack the\r\ncapacity to respond to and recover from them. The\r\nobjective reality of our individual and collective\r\nexperience speaks volumes. We have seen how less than\r\na month ago, tropical storm Debbie — insignificant,\r\nreally, as a tropical storm, not strong enough to be a\r\nhurricane — devastated the banana industry in Saint\r\nLucia, thus wreaking havoc on that country’s economy.\r\nWe need special attention. We need special regimes.\r\nAs I have done in the past, I appeal for greater equity\r\nwithin the international economic system. The time has\r\ncome for the developed world to rethink the outdated\r\npolicy of trying to make a single prescription fit all\r\ncountries. We need to develop a more durable, and\r\ncountry-specific approach, based on fairness, economic\r\ncircumstance and need. Above all, the concept of the\r\nvulnerability index must become part of the economic\r\nlanguage and armamentarium of all multilateral and\r\nnational development institutions.\r\nIndeed, the developing world should not view our\r\nsmall island Caribbean States as dumping grounds for\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nover-produced consumer items, but see us as developing\r\neconomies whose fragile banana and sugar exports need to\r\nbe protected.\r\nThe Declaration of Barbados underscores the fact that\r\nsmall island States have sovereign rights over their natural\r\nresources. The developed world, therefore, cannot claim\r\npaternity over our biodiversity under the pretext that their\r\ntechnology was used.\r\nFurther, on the issue of the environment, I would like\r\nto call upon the developed countries to de-link economic\r\nassistance, trade and investment from environmental\r\nprotection. In most cases, small island developing States\r\nare penalized for allegedly exploiting limited resources and\r\nfor so-called environmental degradation.\r\nI urge the international community to assist developing\r\ncountries to obtain the wherewithal to gauge the\r\nexploitation of resources and to do environmental impact\r\nassessments so as to ensure that the precarious balance is\r\nmaintained.\r\nSocial, economic and political advancement in small\r\ndeveloping countries should not be held to ransom by the\r\nindustrialized world as a way of punishing them for\r\nenvironmental degradation. The protection and preservation\r\nof the environment is a global responsibility and must\r\nengender a collective approach. The industrialized world\r\nmust take responsibility for much of the damage to the\r\nenvironment and work towards a framework for\r\ninternational cooperation and partnership in preserving it.\r\nDeveloping countries ought to be given assistance and\r\nbe presented with alternatives to destroying the forest or\r\ndepleting the limited resources at their disposal. While the\r\ninternational community moves ever closer to the\r\nrealization of economic blocs, special attention must also be\r\ndevoted to the fragile commodities export sector in some of\r\nthese countries, and the need for special regimes to be put\r\nin place to ensure the viability of most of these small\r\neconomies, which do not have the advantage of economies\r\nof scale and large consumer markets.\r\nI should like to repeat my fervent appeal to\r\nGovernments of developed countries and to multilateral\r\nagencies to become more supportive of and responsive to\r\nthe needs of small developing countries by providing the\r\ntechnical assistance, information-sharing, technology\r\ntransfer and investments, and to promote human resource\r\ndevelopment through education and training.\r\nI call on the international community to honour its\r\ncommitment made in Barbados in May 1994:\r\n“The international community should cooperate\r\nwith small island developing States in the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action ... by\r\nproviding effective means, including adequate,\r\npredictable new and additional financial resources in\r\naccordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21;\r\nfacilitating the transfer of environmentally sound\r\ntechnology, including on concessional and\r\npreferential terms as mutually agreed”.\r\n(A/CONF.167/9, Annex I, Part Two, III.1)\r\nThis will ensure success in achieving our goal of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThere is nothing more noble than the gift of life. At\r\nthe important and historic World Summit for Children of\r\n1990, participating Governments agreed to make the\r\nworld a much safer place for future generations of\r\nchildren. At the United Nations Conference on small\r\nStates, we decided to commit our efforts to the efficient\r\nuse of land resources, to work towards creating better\r\neducation and improved health care, and to exploit natural\r\nresources on a sustainable basis.\r\nIf we achieve this, we shall indeed be bequeathing\r\nto our children and their children a much safer world. It\r\nis against the backdrop of safeguarding our children’s\r\nfuture that the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis\r\nparticipated in the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development in Cairo. We fully support the view\r\nthat the issue of population control must be addressed.\r\nAlthough we share the view that a population\r\nexplosion may eventually threaten the Earth’s capacity to\r\nprovide in a sustainable manner, we do not believe that\r\nsimply trying to control population growth will by itself\r\nsolve the serious problems that we are facing today. My\r\nGovernment is of the view that a concerted attempt to\r\nredeploy much of the world’s resources, to discover new\r\nresources and to use them more equitably would better\r\nserve the interest of development for all peoples.\r\nI cannot but remind us all that the international\r\nmenace of drugs and drug trafficking still looms large.\r\nThe danger and the trade are ever-increasing. We should\r\ncontinue to wage a determined and aggressive war on\r\ndrug trafficking and narco-terrorism, which seek to\r\nundermine and unravel the social and political fabric of\r\nour societies.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nThe challenges facing the United Nations are\r\nmonumental, but not more so than those facing individual\r\nnations, large or small, or individuals in poor communities,\r\nas well as in affluent societies. We occupy a global\r\ncommon. Therefore, we must together find practical\r\nsolutions to the problems of hunger, poverty, war, crime,\r\ndevelopment and freedom in every corner of our world. If\r\nwe fail, none will be secure, none will be at peace, none\r\nwill be free.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of St. Kitts and\r\nNevis for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Kennedy A. Simmonds, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of St. Kitts and Nevis,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The next\r\nspeaker is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Foreign Trade and International Business\r\nof Barbados, Her Excellency the Honourable Billie Miller,\r\non whom I now call.\r\nMs. Miller (Barbados): Mr President, it is a pleasure\r\nfor me to congratulate you, Foreign Minister Essy, on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session. The Barbados delegation has\r\ncooperated closely with Your Excellency in the past, and\r\nwe have every confidence that you will guide the work of\r\nthis session with distinction.\r\nIt is with a deep sense of pride and satisfaction that I\r\nalso offer my Government’s congratulations to our outgoing\r\nPresident, Ambassador Rudy Insanally of Guyana. As the\r\nfirst representative from the Caribbean to hold that high\r\noffice, Ambassador Insanally has represented the entire\r\nregion with exemplary skill and diplomacy, and has left\r\nmuch seminal work for us to build upon over the coming\r\nmonths.\r\nI also extend the good wishes of the Barbados\r\nGovernment to our distinguished Secretary-General, Dr\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, whom the Barbadian people had the\r\nhonour of receiving in Bridgetown earlier this year. We\r\noffer him our continued support in his difficult task at the\r\nhelm of the Organization at so crucial an epoch in world\r\naffairs.\r\nOn 23 June this year, the Republic of South Africa\r\nreceived a warm and emotional welcome back to this Hall\r\nas it formally resumed its participation in the work of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nAs it did then, Barbados warmly welcomes the\r\nreturn of South Africa to the community of nations. As\r\nwe rejoice at the demise of apartheid, we are still greatly\r\nmoved by the tremendous sacrifices made by the men,\r\nwomen and children of South Africa that made a\r\ndemocratic South Africa possible, and by the\r\nsteadfastness and the statesmanship of the South African\r\nleaders, particularly President Mandela, whose great\r\nstature and wisdom captivated this body some seven days\r\nago. We also acknowledge the sterling contribution of\r\nthe Special Committee against Apartheid, which for\r\n32 years worked unremittingly to achieve this remarkable\r\noutcome.\r\nSouth Africa is well poised to play a significant role\r\nin this Organization, and the international community has\r\nmuch to learn from the South African experience.\r\nIt is, however, imperative that we recognize that\r\nSouth Africa still very much needs our assistance with the\r\ngreat challenges that lie ahead. The Government of\r\nBarbados pledges to support the Government of South\r\nAfrica as it strives to improve the quality of life for its\r\ncitizens.\r\nBarbados is greatly encouraged by the progress made\r\nin the search for a just and lasting peace in the Middle\r\nEast since the signing of the Washington Declaration by\r\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization in\r\nSeptember last year. The Cairo Accord, which paved the\r\nway for the commencement of Palestinian self-rule in the\r\nGaza Strip and in Jericho, and the Israeli-Jordanian\r\nDeclaration, signed in Washington in July this year, are\r\nwelcome steps on the difficult path towards the attainment\r\nof peace in that region.\r\nBarbados hopes that future resolutions on the Middle\r\nEast will be reflective of these advances and will serve as\r\na fillip to the parties engaged in the negotiation process\r\nas they strive to achieve a comprehensive peace in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\r\n338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\r\nThe people of Barbados went to the polls on\r\n6 September and, in an incident-free election, voted a new\r\nGovernment into office. I am honoured to be a part of\r\nthat new order. The democracy that Barbados practices\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nis ingrained in the culture and habits of its people. For\r\nthem, freedom of speech and association and freedom to\r\nvote at regular intervals for a Government of their choice\r\nand to have the Government installed in an immediate and\r\norderly transfer of power are the simple and natural norms\r\nof life. Yet, sadly, what we in Barbados take for granted,\r\nothers close by in our own hemisphere still struggle to\r\nachieve.\r\nMy country, Barbados, has gained international\r\nrecognition for its comprehensive network of social\r\nservices, its people-oriented development policies and its\r\nhigh quality of life, which have earned it first place in the\r\ndeveloping world in the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme’s Human Development Index. The present\r\nGovernment of the Barbados Labour Party fully recognizes\r\nthe challenges that lie ahead for a small, middle-income\r\ncountry like Barbados to sustain that achievement in an\r\ninternational economic environment that continues to\r\nmarginalize the small and fragile in the developing world.\r\nWith few resource endowments, our survival must depend\r\nexclusively on the skills of our industrial and committed\r\npeople and on the God-given beauty of our natural\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe new Government has responded immediately to\r\nthat challenge in its manifesto \"Charter for Change\", a\r\nfundamental policy document that represents a solemn\r\ncompact by this Government to work together with its\r\ncitizens in seeking for Barbados a strong, strategic position\r\nin the global community of nations as we approach the\r\ntwenty-first century. We are determined to use the\r\nopportunities created by the technological and\r\ncommunications revolution to overcome the obstacle of size\r\nand to harness our natural and strategic assets to convert\r\nBarbados into a full-service economy. We will encourage\r\nthe development of tourism and the international financial\r\nservices and informatics sectors to their fullest potential.\r\nWe will create a business-friendly environment that will be\r\nconducive to new investment, both local and foreign. We\r\nwill facilitate the growth and development of the small-\r\nbusiness sector and encourage entrepreneurship. A\r\nradically restructured Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign\r\nTrade and International Business, under my direction, has\r\nbeen put in place to spearhead this endeavour.\r\nAgainst this background, the people of Barbados view\r\nwith concern the tragic situation of Haiti. For far too long\r\nHaiti has been a burden on the collective conscience of the\r\nregion. For too long a just and equitable solution has not\r\nonly eluded the countries in our own hemisphere, but\r\neluded also the grasp of the Security Council of the United\r\nNations. We are greatly encouraged that the deployment\r\ninto Haiti of the multinational force took place under\r\npeaceful circumstances and that the spectre of a bloody\r\nconfrontation was averted. The participation of Barbados\r\nin the multinational force and the United Nations Mission\r\nin Haiti, authorized by Security Council resolution 940\r\n(1994), is testimony to our commitment to ensuring that\r\nthe will of the Haitian people is finally respected and\r\ntheir lawful President and his administration restored to\r\noffice without delay. The clear terms of resolution 940\r\n(1994) must be honoured in full, and the power of a\r\nbrutal and lawless military and its callous leadership\r\neffectively and permanently neutralized.\r\nAs stated by Prime Minister Owen Arthur of\r\nBarbados in his recent address at the White House on\r\nbehalf of the Heads of Government of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM):\r\n“Where democracy has taken root, it should be\r\nencouraged to grow and to flourish. Like the Soviet\r\nUnion and South Africa, Haiti too deserves its\r\nrendezvous with democracy. The Haitian people\r\nwished for it. They suffered for it. They voted for\r\nit. And now they are dying for it.”\r\nHaiti’s rendezvous with democracy has now begun\r\nin earnest. Hope is finally returning to a people that for\r\na very long time had felt that all was lost. But as we in\r\nCARICOM have warned on numerous previous occasions,\r\nthe ballot box is merely the beginning of the democratic\r\nprocess. The international community must now\r\norchestrate a massive effort to put in place the\r\ninstitutional infrastructure necessary to maintain and\r\nstrengthen the fledgling Haitian democracy and to bury\r\nforever the ghosts of the past. The reconstruction of Haiti\r\nentails the creation of conditions that will ensure that the\r\nrights and freedoms of all Haitian people are respected.\r\nIt must also respond effectively to the critical\r\ndevelopment needs of the Haitian population and to their\r\njust aspirations to share equitably in the resources of their\r\ncountry.\r\nThe Governments of the Caribbean Community are\r\ncommitted to playing their part in this vital phase of the\r\nprocess, and to this end have agreed to provide assistance,\r\nin concert with other members of the international\r\ncommunity, in the development of a civilian force as a\r\nprofessional organization for maintaining the peace and\r\nrespect for human rights in Haiti. They are also prepared\r\nto make available to the constitutionally appointed\r\nauthorities in Haiti a cadre of officers from the public\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nservice of the member States of CARICOM to provide\r\ntraining in public administration, the conduct of elections\r\nand other activities in support of the institutionalization of\r\nthe democratic process.\r\nAs we look across the Caribbean Community, we see\r\nmuch that gives us cause for hope. The private and public\r\nsectors of our subregion are collaborating more and more,\r\nwhile, at the same time, intergovernmental cooperation has\r\nincreased. The political dialogue between Heads of\r\nGovernment is flourishing, and economic cooperation is\r\nexpanding. Concerted efforts are also being made to boost\r\nintraregional trade and to improve the economic, social and\r\ncultural well-being of our peoples.\r\nThis year the Caribbean Community celebrated its\r\ntwenty-first anniversary. A pioneer among integration\r\nmovements in our hemisphere, CARICOM has sought to\r\nrespond to the reality that Caribbean peoples share a\r\ncommon destiny, which is best realized through\r\ncoordination and cooperation in pursuit of their economic,\r\nsocial and political well-being.\r\nThis year also, building on the foundations laid by\r\nmany statesmen of the Caribbean and on the ideas most\r\nrecently developed by the West Indian Commission, the\r\nleaders of 25 States whose shores are washed by the\r\nCaribbean Sea met at Cartagena, Colombia, to sign the\r\nConvention establishing the Association of Caribbean\r\nStates. The Association will bring together in their\r\ncommon pursuit of development 40 Caribbean-basin States,\r\ncountries and territories with a total population of\r\n200 million. Its stated aims are: to promote, utilize and\r\ndevelop the collective capabilities of the Caribbean region\r\nto achieve sustainable cultural economic, social, scientific\r\nand technological advancement; to develop the potential of\r\nthe Caribbean Sea through interaction among member\r\nStates and with third parties; to promote an enhanced\r\neconomic space for trade and investment with opportunities\r\nfor cooperation and concerted action, in order to increase\r\nthe benefits which accrue to the peoples of the Caribbean\r\nfrom their resources and assets, including the Caribbean\r\nSea; and to establish, consolidate and augment, as\r\nappropriate, institutional structures and cooperation\r\nagreements responsive to the various cultural identities,\r\ndevelopmental needs and innovative systems within the\r\nregion.\r\nBarbados fully supports the aims of the Association\r\nand welcomes its establishment as an important step in the\r\nconsolidation of the regional integration effort. But our\r\naims to foster development across the Caribbean will not be\r\ncomplete until all of the partners are free to participate on\r\nan equal footing. In this regard we believe the time has\r\ncome to remove the last vestige of cold-war rivalry from\r\nour hemisphere. We join the international community in\r\nappealing to the United States to lift its punitive economic\r\nembargo on Cuba and to facilitate the economic\r\nreintegration of that neighbouring State into the world\r\neconomy. We urge that political will be found to resolve\r\nthe remaining differences between the two countries\r\nthrough further dialogue.\r\nEarlier this year, 116 countries and 150\r\nnon-governmental organizations were represented at the\r\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States, held in Barbados. The\r\nfirst follow-up activity to be held in fulfillment of a\r\nmandate from the International Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development, the \"Earth summit\", the\r\nConference aimed to develop a blueprint of priority\r\nactions for the implementation of Agenda 21 in the\r\nspecific context of small island developing States. The\r\nresults of the Conference will shortly come before the\r\nGeneral Assembly for its endorsement at this session.\r\nWe urge the international community to lend its full\r\nsupport to the measures proposed to ensure sustained\r\nfollow-up and implementation of the proposals contained\r\nin the Barbados Programme of Action.\r\nOn 16 November, the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea will come into force, 12 years after it\r\nwas opened for signature at Montego Bay. We welcome\r\nthe recent developments which have enhanced the\r\nprospects of universal participation in the Convention and\r\nlook forward to the inauguration of the work of its\r\nrelevant organs. We look forward too to the successful\r\nconclusion next year of the Conference on Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, and to the\r\nadoption of a legally binding regime to regulate the\r\nconservation and management of these threatened stocks.\r\nThe wise observation by the Secretary-General that\r\n“development is a fundamental right and the strongest\r\nfoundation for peace” has been recognized by the General\r\nAssembly, which in recent years has been giving priority\r\nattention to social development by convening a number of\r\ninternational conferences devoted primarily to social and\r\neconomic issues, as envisaged in Article 55 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nThe recent International Conference on Population\r\nand Development spoke volumes about the changing\r\nnature of international dialogue and the changing role of\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nwomen. In greater numbers and with greater strength, civil\r\nsociety in the form of non-governmental organizations\r\nworked alongside Governments to craft a plan of action\r\nwhich might realistically address the reproductive health of\r\nwomen and the broader needs of women in the\r\ndevelopment process. We owe a debt of gratitude to\r\nMs. Nafis Sadik, Mr. Fred Sai and the rest of the\r\nConference leadership, who pushed for and achieved a\r\nbroad consensus on many difficult issues which fall into the\r\nrealm of the population and development dialogue.\r\nFor my country, the outcome of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development and the Plan of\r\nAction confirm much of the effort which has been spent on\r\nimproving women’s access to family planning and health\r\nservices. I stand before the Assembly as an example of the\r\nprogressive attitude which Barbadians hold regarding\r\nwomen’s status and leadership potential. I am also\r\nreminded that we too need to work on areas highlighted by\r\nthe population Conference proceedings: difficult issues\r\nsuch as reducing maternal mortality, addressing the needs\r\nof special groups such as youth, and looking at how our\r\npolicies and programmes further women’s empowerment.\r\nStill, I am heartened by the openness of the United\r\nNations processes to the contributions of citizens’ groups\r\nalongside Governments, and will watch with great interest\r\nthe progress at the social summit and women’s conference.\r\nThese conferences, together with the 1990 World Summit\r\nfor Children and the 1992 Rio de Janiero Conference,\r\nextend along a continuum which urges action to look into\r\nthe difficulties faced by our citizens and at how\r\nGovernment policies can relieve the uneven pressures which\r\nare put upon women.\r\nBarbados considers that these meetings are of vital\r\nimportance and that their core themes demand the adoption\r\nof a meaningful programme of action that would\r\ndemonstrate a firm commitment to the oft-repeated concept\r\nthat the human being should indeed be placed at the centre\r\nof development. Poverty, unemployment, gender equality,\r\nchildren’s rights and other integrated issues must be tackled\r\nwith the same urgency and resolve as other aspirations of\r\nthe Charter if this Organization intends to signal a true\r\nturning-point in its human-development strategy.\r\nThe United Nations has contributed significantly to\r\npromoting and ensuring respect for and observance of\r\nhuman rights since the adoption of the Universal\r\nDeclaration on Human Rights on 10 December 1948. The\r\nlegal framework and the established human rights\r\nmachinery have been greatly strengthened by the Vienna\r\nDeclaration and Plan of Action adopted by the World\r\nConference on Human Rights held at Vienna in June\r\n1993. The Conference affirmed that democracy,\r\ndevelopment and respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually\r\nreinforcing, and especially emphasized that the right to\r\ndevelopment is a basic human right.\r\nAt its forty-eighth session, the General Assembly\r\nhonoured the Latin American and Caribbean region by\r\nappointing His Excellency Mr. José Ayala Lasso of\r\nEcuador as the first United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights as a first step in implementing the\r\nVienna Declaration. At its forty-ninth session, the\r\nGeneral Assembly must now seek with equal vigour to\r\nimplement the other important measures of the Vienna\r\nDeclaration. Barbados urges that the Working Group on\r\nHuman Rights pursue its mandate in a coherent,\r\ntransparent and balanced manner in order that the long-\r\nterm interests of human rights may be truly served.\r\nBarbados believes that every human being is entitled\r\nto the unfettered enjoyment of all human rights and that\r\nthe ultimate human right is the right to life. In this\r\ncontext, we urge that the Assembly give serious\r\nconsideration at this session to the harmful impact that\r\nillicit drug trafficking, organized transnational crime and\r\nterrorism have on the effective enjoyment of human\r\nrights. Barbados welcomes the recent decision of the\r\nCommission on Narcotic Drugs to establish a working\r\ngroup to pursue areas of collaboration with the\r\nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in\r\nmaritime trafficking. We are also encouraged by the\r\nprogress the Working Group has made on the draft statute\r\nfor an international criminal court and support the\r\nrecommendation by the International Law Commission\r\nthat the General Assembly convene an international\r\nconference of plenipotentiaries to study the draft statute\r\nand to conclude a convention on the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal court.\r\nMy Government has always been a strong supporter\r\nof the United Nations. We believe that in the emerging\r\nnew world order it is more critical than ever for the\r\nUnited Nations to be capable of fulfilling its role as the\r\nprimary guarantor of the security and independence of\r\nsmall States, and as the protector of the powerless and\r\neconomically vulnerable who form the vast majority of its\r\nmembership. It is also important for the small, but\r\nmorally authoritative, voices of this world body to\r\ncontinue to stress the absolute necessity for the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\ninternational community to use equitably and responsibly\r\nthe powers conferred upon it in the Charter.\r\nOver the past year, priority attention has been given in\r\nthe work of the General Assembly and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council to the task of elaborating an Agenda for\r\nDevelopment as a necessary corollary to, and indeed a\r\nprerequisite for, the \"Agenda for Peace\". We have taken\r\ncareful note of the Secretary-General’s report to the forty-\r\neighth session in this regard and look forward to giving\r\ndetailed consideration to the recommendations which he\r\nwill present in his report to this session.\r\nWhile we recognize that the United Nations has an\r\ninescapable responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, we must acknowledge also\r\nthat peace and development are indivisible. The root\r\ncauses of most conflicts are to be found in the legacy of\r\npoverty and dispossession that underdevelopment\r\nengenders. While we agree that the world body must of\r\nnecessity respond to critical conflict situations as they arise,\r\nit must at the same time be pointed out that the vast\r\nmajority of the world’s population does not live in a state\r\nof war or civil conflict. The betterment of the economic\r\nand social conditions of that majority deserves a central\r\nplace in the deliberative and decision-making bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations and must be the principal objective of an\r\nAgenda for Development.\r\nAn Agenda for Development must promote a new\r\nconsensus on international cooperation for development and\r\nan integrated approach which is people-centred.\r\nFurthermore, it must be based on creating a new\r\ncooperative relationship between the United Nations and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, one which recognizes the\r\nfundamental importance of the social dimension to\r\ndevelopment. The policies pursued by these institutions\r\nover the past decade, particularly within the framework of\r\nstructural-adjustment programmes, have left a legacy which\r\nconvinces us of the need for radical reform.\r\nWe must remind ourselves that the improvement of\r\nhuman well-being is the fundamental criterion to which the\r\ndevelopment objective must respond. There is little value\r\nin short-term economic growth if the measures used to\r\nattain it result inevitably in social disintegration. The\r\nBarbados delegation therefore strongly supports the view of\r\nthe South Centre that fresh approaches must be sought and\r\na new social contract established if social, political and\r\neconomic objectives are to be reconciled. The United\r\nNations is the appropriate forum to ensure that this\r\nreconciliation of objectives can be promoted in a\r\nuniversal, transparent and democratic manner.\r\nSeveral useful views have emerged over the past\r\nyear during the discussion of the Open-Ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council.\r\nWe look forward to an intensification of these discussions\r\nduring the forty-ninth session. Any enlargement of the\r\nCouncil must only be contemplated within a context that\r\ndeals also with the issue of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation, the question of the veto, and the question\r\nof increasing the transparency of the operations of the\r\nCouncil and its accountability to the wider international\r\ncommunity. Decisions arrived at hastily to deal with only\r\none aspect of the issue, or merely to respond to an\r\narbitrary deadline of next year’s celebrations, will not\r\nprovide a lasting solution to this critical issue.\r\nThe United Nations will have reached a remarkable\r\nmilestone in 1995 as it celebrates 50 years of tireless\r\nservice to the goal of enabling all mankind to live in\r\ndignity and enjoy better standards of life in larger\r\nfreedom. While it is fitting that we acknowledge this\r\nmilestone with appropriate ceremony, we must recognize\r\nthat the United Nations will be called upon to face\r\nchallenges in the twenty-first century that could be\r\nimmeasurably more difficult than those of the previous\r\nera. Global stability will depend more and more on the\r\nability of the United Nations to promote economic and\r\nsocial justice than on its ability to silence guns.\r\nThe kind of challenges I have in mind are poignantly\r\netched in the following quotation from an unpublished\r\nwork in progress entitled \"The Rwanda Poem\" by the\r\ndistinguished Barbadian poet and writer Mr. Kamau\r\nBrathwaite, who, only a few days ago, received the\r\nNeustadt International Prize for Literature:\r\n\"Sa/hell crumbles into these flickering miles\r\nMiles of the silences of holes\r\nOf the cold dry moon in our belly\r\nMarrow burning its protein into its sound\r\nSkin smouldering to ash\r\nHolocaust of dome - there is no music anywhere\r\nHeads propped up on sticks of skeletons\r\nBald headed children naked of all else\r\nBut large deep agate space-age eyes\"\r\nGlobal stability will be difficult to maintain if the\r\ncries of the majority of the world’s peoples, whose lives\r\nare marked by a lack of food, shelter and education and\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nwho are afflicted by poverty, disease, and other forms of\r\nsocial misery, continue to go unheeded and are merely\r\nreflected as glaring statistics in United Nations reports on\r\nthe world’s social situation.\r\nIt is Barbados’ belief that the challenge that will\r\nconfront the United Nations in the era ahead will lie\r\nundoubtedly in the humanitarian sphere. This Organization\r\nis the only universal body with the legitimacy to take up\r\nthis challenge. But if it is to meet this challenge\r\nsuccessfully, it must be made more efficient, effective and\r\nalert. In this context, prevention must supersede reaction.\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization next year, \"We the peoples\" must renew our\r\ncommitment to this unique body and strive to ensure its\r\nrelevance to the twenty-first century. Mr. President, be\r\nassured of Barbados’ commitment to these endeavours.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Finance and Economic Affairs of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica.\r\nDame Mary Eugenia Charles, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Finance and Economic Affairs of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I have\r\npleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nFinance and Economic Affairs of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica, Her Excellency The Honourable Mary Eugenia\r\nCharles. I invite her to address the General Assembly.\r\nDame Mary Eugenia Charles (Dominica):\r\nMr. President, permit me to extend my delegation’s\r\ncongratulations to you and your country, Côte d’Ivoire, on\r\nthe occasion of your election to the high office of the\r\npresidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session. There is absolutely no doubt in my\r\nmind that with your proven diplomatic skills and\r\nconsiderable experience the affairs of the General Assembly\r\nwill be conducted in a manner that will redound to the\r\ncredit of this institution. At the same time I must express\r\nmy delegation’s heartfelt appreciation and thanks to your\r\nimmediate predecessor in office, Ambassador Samuel\r\nInsanally, for the competence which he demonstrated in the\r\ndischarge of his duties. His commendable performance is\r\na source of pride to me as it is to all citizens of the\r\nCaribbean region.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI am very happy that we are here with you today,\r\nSir.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWhile the maintenance of peace and security remains\r\nthe main objective of the United Nations, the global\r\nenvironment, the widening gap between rich and poor\r\nnations, the failure of the ill-defined new world order to\r\nmaterialize, and the forces released by the ending of the\r\ncold war present the Organization with new problems and\r\nchallenges. As regional conflicts erupt, the consequential\r\nincrease in the number of displaced persons and refugees\r\nexerts greater pressure on the United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping apparatus at a time when its available resources\r\nare already severely taxed. It is imperative, therefore,\r\nthat the United Nations continue with its restructuring\r\nprogramme and with those initiatives calculated to\r\nincrease efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the\r\ncapability of the Organization to achieve desirable results.\r\nHowever, cost-effectiveness, commendable as that may\r\nbe, should not be at the expense of those worthwhile\r\nprogrammes designed to benefit small developing nations.\r\nWe firmly believe that the United Nations has the\r\ncapacity to maintain those programmes while it strives\r\nsimultaneously to exercise the necessary budgetary\r\nrestraints.\r\nThe ethnic and tribal conflicts in the former\r\nYugoslavia and Rwanda and the reported acts of genocide\r\nand other atrocities are troubling and must exercise the\r\nminds and hearts of human beings everywhere. The\r\ninternational community cannot appear to condone such\r\nreprehensible acts, and appropriate measures must be\r\ntaken to punish those responsible. Accordingly, Dominica\r\nunhesitatingly supports the establishment of international\r\ntribunals for the trial and punishment of those persons\r\nfound guilty of crimes against humanity.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica supports the\r\nindefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and as we look\r\nforward optimistically to a nuclear-free world we call\r\nupon all nations possessing weapons of mass destruction\r\nto join in a cooperative effort to reduce and finally to\r\neliminate those weapons from the face of the Earth. We\r\nmust also express concern at the apparent unwillingness\r\nof the international community to stem the increase in the\r\nrate of production of conventional arms of increasing\r\nsophistication and potential for destruction. Acquired in\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nmany instances by third world nations, ostensibly to\r\nmaintain secure borders and deter aggression, these\r\nweapons very often become effective instruments of\r\ninternal repression and the cause of national and regional\r\ninstability. Time after time the United Nations is called\r\nupon to expend its limited resources in repairing the\r\ndamage and in alleviating the consequential suffering and\r\nmisery. We are consistent in maintaining that a reordering\r\nof priorities is called for and that a slight shifting of\r\nresources away from the acquisition of unnecessary arsenals\r\nand into development programmes would result in\r\ntremendous social and economic benefits to the citizens of\r\nmany developing countries.\r\nIn many countries human rights abuses occur on a\r\ndaily basis. Dominica’s respect for human rights and its\r\ncommitment to ensure that the rights of every citizen are\r\nprotected cannot be questioned. It is in keeping with that\r\ncommitment that the Commonwealth of Dominica applauds\r\nthe establishment of the Office of the High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights and will support efforts to make that\r\nOffice and the Centre for Human Rights effective\r\ninstruments in the promotion and protection of human\r\nrights. We believe, however, that in the discharge of his\r\nresponsibilities the task of the High Commissioner would\r\nbe significantly strengthened if the United Nations General\r\nAssembly were to abandon its present selective\r\ncondemnation of human rights abuses. Human rights\r\nabuses should be condemned wherever and whenever they\r\noccur and no nation should be permitted to take comfort\r\nfrom the fact that its violation of human rights covenants\r\nwill escape the glare of publicity and the strictures of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe readmission of a democratic, non-racial South\r\nAfrica to the United Nations on 23 June 1994 is a source\r\nof tremendous pleasure for my delegation and a tribute to\r\nthe many persons and organizations, both inside and outside\r\nthe United Nations, who worked so tirelessly in the long\r\nand hard struggle to put an end to the pernicious system of\r\napartheid. The majority of the people of South Africa must\r\nbe congratulated on their sustained effort and determination,\r\nas well as on their conciliatory attitude which augurs well\r\nfor the new South Africa. Above all we must congratulate\r\nand applaud the President, Mr. Nelson Mandela, and his\r\nSecond Deputy President, Mr. de Klerk, on the courage,\r\nconsiderable skill and political enlightenment which they\r\njointly and effectively harnessed in reaching an\r\naccomplishment that may eventually be regarded as a\r\nmodel for the world. The journey has only just begun.\r\nMany difficulties lie ahead but there are reasons to be\r\noptimistic. With the assistance and support of the\r\ninternational community South Africa will succeed.\r\nThe progress that has been made in the bilateral\r\nnegotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbours in the\r\nMiddle East is heart-warming indeed. With the first steps\r\nhaving been taken on the road to Palestinian autonomy in\r\nthe West Bank and Gaza, and with the signing of the\r\naccord between Jordan and Israel, there appears to be an\r\nexcellent opportunity for an eventual resolution of the\r\nconflict that has plagued that region for too long.\r\nOptimism must be tempered with caution, however. The\r\nimplementation of the accords and full realization of\r\nPalestinian autonomy will depend for their success on\r\ngenerous financial support, both private and public. And\r\nwhile the United Nations must not be intrusive, its interest\r\nin seeing that the legitimate hopes, aspirations and\r\nsecurity needs of the people of the area are realized\r\nimposes upon it a duty to continue to be seized with the\r\nsubject-matter and to continue to monitor the process and\r\nthe progress towards a full and just peace in the Middle\r\nEast.\r\nIn different forums and at various times since\r\nSeptember 1991, the Commonwealth of Dominica has\r\nconsistently called for the ousting of the military regime\r\nin Port au Prince, the return of President Aristide to Haiti\r\nand the restoration of democracy and the rule of law to\r\nthat country. For three years the military leaders in Haiti\r\nhave authorized, encouraged and condoned brutal acts of\r\nrevenge and wanton violence against the citizens of Haiti\r\nand have continued to exercise governmental power in\r\ndefiance of world opinion. They temporized by entering\r\ninto the Governors Island Agreement, which they later\r\nfailed to honour. Their intransigence and unreliability led\r\nthe Security Council to conclude that the unique character\r\nof the situation in Haiti required an exceptional response\r\nand that there was need for the use of all necessary means\r\nto facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military\r\nleaders and the prompt return of the legitimately elected\r\nPresident.\r\nFaced with the prospect of having to confront an\r\noverwhelming multinational force, the military leaders\r\nhave finally decided to step down, and while recent\r\nevents give reason for pause, the prospect of the\r\nrestoration of democracy to Haiti seems decidedly\r\nbrighter than at any time in the last 36 months. When the\r\nHaitian people were the victims of officially sanctioned\r\nbrutality and violence, we felt their pain. When President\r\nAristide returns, we will rejoice with them. We wish the\r\nHaitian people well, and we will do whatever we can to\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nassist in their efforts to attain that measure of freedom that\r\ncan come only from a government established on\r\ndemocratic principles. President Aristide is devoted to\r\nHaiti and the well-being of Haitians. We must support him\r\nand encourage him in this daunting and lonely task that he\r\nhas undertaken for his people.\r\nHowever, as friends of the Haitian people, we plead\r\nwith them to understand that democracy cannot be imposed\r\nfrom outside; it can only develop from a genuine desire of\r\nthe people of Haiti of all persuasions. A political\r\nenvironment of intense hatred and passionate desire for\r\nrevenge is not fertile ground for a young and fragile\r\ndemocracy. Success in their new endeavour will require\r\nthat nobility of spirit that seeks the path of reconciliation\r\nand trust and eschews vengeance and recriminations. No\r\none can pretend that the task will be easy, but the following\r\nexcerpt from a speech delivered by Archbishop Desmond\r\nTutu at the commemoration of the Day of the African Child\r\non 16 June 1994 might be instructive to the Haitian people.\r\nSpeaking of his beloved South Africa, the venerable\r\narchbishop said:\r\n“The Minister of Justice of South Africa was detained\r\nseveral times. He suffers from a heart condition. The\r\nsecurity forces tried to kill him by swapping his\r\ntablets. Today he is writing, drafting the legislation\r\nfor an amnesty to forgive the security forces that\r\nwanted to kill him. If it can happen in a South Africa\r\nwhere it is said the problem is so intractable, no\r\ncountry in the world can ever again have an excuse\r\nfor not being able to resolve its problem. God is\r\nsaying, I set before you South Africa as a paradigm.\r\nThis is how it can be done. There is hope for the\r\nworld when South Africa can become as it has\r\nbecome.”\r\nWe are in accord with Archbishop Tutu, and we are firmly\r\nof the view that if it can be done in South Africa it can and\r\nmust be done in Haiti.\r\nThe exclusion of the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nfrom membership in this body and from participation in the\r\nactivities of its various agencies continues to be of concern\r\nto us. It appears incongruous to us that an industrial\r\ncountry of 21 million people with a democratic\r\nGovernment, with full membership in the Asian\r\nDevelopment Bank, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\r\nForum, the Pacific Basin Economic Council and the Pacific\r\nEconomic Cooperation Council, and with the capacity to\r\nmake meaningful and worthwhile contributions to the\r\nactivities of the United Nations is denied membership when\r\neveryone agrees that it exercises sovereign authority over\r\na defined geographical area. On the principle of\r\nuniversality alone, the request of the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan for membership in the United Nations is\r\njustifiable. We do not believe that the admission of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan precludes eventual\r\nunification. On the contrary, in our view it is likely to\r\nhelp the process along, and no one can pretend that\r\nparallel representation stands in the way. The citizens of\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan deserve to be accorded\r\nthose rights and privileges enjoyed by citizens of all\r\nsovereign States, and the commonwealth of Dominica\r\nadvocates and supports the admission of the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan to full membership in the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. Abdellah (Tunisia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe are gratified that the participants at the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nin Cairo have wisely arrived at a consensus that gives\r\nsupport to the view that, in the words of one\r\ncommentator, \"sustainable development cannot be realized\r\nwithout the full engagement and complete empowerment\r\nof women\". That proposition has long been\r\nacknowledged and incorporated into our decision-making\r\nprocesses, to the extent that today women have equal\r\naccess to education at all levels and gender equality\r\nmanifests itself in all facets of life in Dominica. We\r\nrealize that the plan of action requires increased spending\r\non social programmes for its viability, and it is hoped that\r\nat the Conference in Copenhagen in 1995, participants\r\nfrom donor and recipient countries will arrive at a\r\nreasonable formula in that regard.\r\nWe support the establishment of the World Trade\r\nOrganization and the liberalization of trade practices, but\r\nwe need to remind the international community that\r\nfragile economies of small island states can be easily\r\ndestroyed if free trade does not embody that measure of\r\nfairness necessary for their survival. We require that the\r\nlarger and economically successful States be mindful of\r\nthe need for poor small States to survive. The recent\r\nformation of the Association of Caribbean States will, we\r\nhope, provide a framework for increased trade among the\r\nStates in the area and enhance the capability of the region\r\nin its search for ways to reach beneficial accommodation\r\nwith more powerful trading groups in the hemisphere.\r\nWe look forward to the forthcoming Summit of the\r\nAmericas and the proposed frank and detailed\r\nexamination of such issues as the hemispheric integration\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nprocess - including a hemispheric free trade zone - the role\r\nof multilateral financial institutions, sustainable\r\ndevelopment, and resource flows and debt in hemispheric\r\ndevelopment. We hope that out of that gathering will come\r\nnot only a keener appreciation of the vulnerabilities of the\r\nsmaller States in the region but also a greater impetus for\r\ncollaboration on matters of regional trade and development.\r\nAfter 49 years, its imperfections notwithstanding, the\r\nUnited Nations remains the world’s greatest deliberative\r\nbody and mankind’s greatest hope for survival in a\r\nreasonably well-ordered and peaceful global community.\r\nAs the United Nations prepares to celebrate its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, we need to place on record our recognition of\r\nits many worthwhile accomplishments, and we hope that it\r\nwill continue in its search for new and innovative ways to\r\nmeet the challenges of the future.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Finance and Economic Affairs of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Dominica for the statement she has\r\njust made.\r\nDame Mary Eugenia Charles, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Finance and Economic Affairs of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic\r\nof Maldives, His Excellency, Mr. Fathula Jameel, on whom\r\nI now call.\r\nMr. Jameel (Maldives): It gives me great pleasure to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his election to guide the\r\nwork of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.\r\nHis election to that important post is testimony to his\r\npersonal credentials and to the important role played by\r\nCôte d’Ivoire in international affairs. I am confident that\r\nhis wise guidance and leadership will enable this session of\r\nthe General Assembly to deal successfully with the very\r\nimportant issues on its agenda.\r\nI should also like to commend the work of his\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of\r\nGuyana, who demonstrated outstanding diplomatic skills\r\nand dedication in so ably steering the work of the forty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nAllow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, for his untiring\r\nefforts in promoting international peace and security and\r\njustice.\r\nThe winds of change that are currently sweeping\r\nacross the world give us, more then ever before, new\r\nhope in the promise of a better future, a future in which\r\nscarce resources will be utilized to feed the millions of\r\nhungry mouths and to provide basic health care, safe\r\ndrinking water and a basic level of education to the needy\r\nrather than be again spent to build military might and to\r\nthreaten the world with a new era of confrontation - a\r\nfuture which will provide a safe and clean environment in\r\nwhich human beings can live safely, in dignity, respect\r\nand hope.\r\nThe recently held World Conference on Human\r\nRights, the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nand the forthcoming World Conference on Women and\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development are clear\r\ntestimony to that hope.\r\nThis was the dream of our founding fathers, and it\r\nis also ours. With the end of the cold war and on the eve\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, let us\r\nnot hesitate to rededicate ourselves once again, with more\r\nvigour and more commitment, to the fulfilment of this\r\ndream.\r\nThe United Nations must be able to evolve and\r\npromote a stronger and more comprehensive system for\r\npreventive diplomacy and peacemaking. Let us not allow\r\npotentially dangerous situations to escalate into situations\r\nthat leave the international community with no alternative\r\nbut to take painful and expensive measures to enforce\r\npeace. Most important, the Organization must play a\r\nrevitalized role as the principal broker and promoter of\r\npeace and justice in the world.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the present process of\r\nrestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations. We\r\nare hopeful that the process of reform will take into\r\nconsideration the concerns of all States to protect their\r\nsecurity and maintain their sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity.\r\nThe establishment of effective measures of internal\r\noversight of the United Nations system is one of the\r\nuseful steps taken by the General Assembly. Special\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nattention must be given to all the issues involved in the\r\nchoice and recruitment of personnel if we truly intend to\r\nimprove the efficiency of the Organization, and we must\r\nemphasize quality rather than quantity so that the United\r\nNations system may remain non-biased, less-politicized and\r\nvibrant.\r\nFor Maldives, the United Nations has always been and\r\nwill always be the best hope for warding off challenges to\r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States. The\r\nCharter of the United Nations, which we remain firmly\r\nbound to honour, recognizes the inalienable right of every\r\nnation to exist within secure boundaries and of the people\r\nof every country to live in dignity and peace. It therefore\r\nfalls to the world Organization to be the unequivocal\r\nguarantor of security and protection for those countries that\r\nlack the physical means to provide their own or that might\r\nsimply be overrun by more powerful States.\r\nOnce again at this session the United Nations General\r\nAssembly will deliberate the agenda item on the protection\r\nand security of small States. My delegation hopes that\r\nimportant item will once again receive the same attention\r\nand support it was given at the forty-fourth and forty-sixth\r\nsessions.\r\nMy delegation draws inspiration from the unwavering\r\nand renewed resolve of the international community with\r\nregard to important security and political issues, which was\r\nsignificantly demonstrated in the Gulf crisis, among others.\r\nThe inherent vulnerability of small States was never more\r\nclearly demonstrated than it was in the case of the\r\ninternational intervention in Kuwait in 1990. Who, indeed,\r\ncould have imagined that a fully sovereign State Member\r\nof the United Nations, economically strong and with\r\npowerful friends, would find itself at risk of being wiped\r\noff the world political map - and if a country like Kuwait\r\ncan be forced into such a precarious position, where is the\r\nsecurity of far smaller and economically weaker States?\r\nThe recent instances in which the United Nations took\r\nfirm and decisive action certainly highlight the importance\r\nand effectiveness of the collective-security system\r\nenvisaged in the Charter. In addition, they brought home\r\nto the international community the fact that a rapid-response\r\nsystem needs to be constantly in place if international peace\r\nand security are to be maintained. The Security Council\r\nSummit Meeting in January 1992 reaffirmed that body’s\r\ncommitment to collective security as a valid principle in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. My\r\ndelegation believes that this is the time to give urgent and\r\ndeeper consideration to the overall question of collective\r\nsecurity. This is easily said, but the subject includes the\r\nquestion of improving the skill and ability to exercise\r\nforesight and act with dispatch, as well as of building up\r\nthe capacity and capability to move with greater\r\ncoordination.\r\nTrue success in accomplishing this challenging task\r\nfacing the international community will require sincere\r\ncommitment and dedication. This can be achieved only\r\nif every Member of the Organization exercises the\r\npolitical will to settle all disputes peacefully, without\r\ndiscrimination, and to assist the United Nations to move\r\nforward in that direction. The recommendations set forth\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report, \"An Agenda for Peace\",\r\non preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking\r\nand post-conflict peace-building, can serve as an\r\nextremely effective tool to achieve this end.\r\nMy delegation sincerely feels that as we study\r\ntogether every possible means of strengthening the\r\nstructure of the United Nations to make it more effective\r\nand responsive to a changing world the security of small\r\nStates must be given its rightful place when priorities are\r\nreviewed and special consideration given the task of\r\npreserving international peace, security and stability.\r\nOne of the most encouraging events in world history\r\nhas been the classic manner in which the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa, under the leadership of President Nelson\r\nMandela, has not only eliminated the policy of apartheid,\r\nthat most inhuman form of racial discrimination, but also\r\nestablished democracy with full respect for all the norms\r\nof national reconciliation. It is therefore with sincere\r\nsentiments of congratulation and good wishes that my\r\ndelegation welcomes the restoration of the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa to its rightful place in the family of nations\r\nand this Organization.\r\nI view the positive developments in the Middle East\r\nas a most valuable lesson on how sincere, determined and\r\ndedicated efforts based on peace and conciliation can\r\nyield rich dividends in dangerously volatile situations.\r\nI sincerely feel that the international community\r\nowes a debt of gratitude to the Governments of the\r\nUnited States of America and other States concerned for\r\ntheir most valuable contributions to the creation of the\r\nnecessary atmosphere for the ongoing peace negotiations\r\nin the Middle East, in which I fervently hope and pray\r\nthe inalienable rights of the people of Palestine will be\r\nrestored. I am convinced that the present trend of events,\r\nif pursued with patience and in good faith by all the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nparties involved, will result in the establishment of a\r\nsovereign, independent State of Palestine, the settlement of\r\nthe issues related to the occupied Territories and finally the\r\nattainment by that region of a comprehensive and lasting\r\npeace based on the principles of justice and equality.\r\nTime and again Maldives has stressed the importance\r\nof continuing accelerated efforts to attain the United\r\nNations goal of completing the disarmament process. My\r\ndelegation firmly believes that success in preserving and\r\nmaintaining international peace, security and stability will\r\ndepend on progress in the field of disarmament.\r\nAdmittedly, there have been significant achievements in this\r\narea. However, the production, stockpiling and sale of\r\nweapons of war continue on an alarming scale throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nAlthough there is a convergence of views regarding\r\nthe dangers of nuclear arms, some countries seem to desire\r\nto acquire or retain nuclear-weapons technology. We\r\nbelieve that so long as this trend continues unabated it will\r\nindeed be difficult to improve the climate of security and to\r\npave the way for a safer world for generations to come.\r\nOne of the key disarmament issues confronting the\r\ninternational community is the question of a decision on\r\nextending the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons. We remain convinced that its unconditional and\r\nindefinite extension should be one of the cornerstones for\r\nbuilding a world free of all nuclear weapons. But this\r\nrequires that all the countries possessing nuclear weapons\r\nand nuclear-weapons technology take a responsible stand,\r\nsomething that can come about only through a sincere\r\ndesire to establish a genuine international non-nuclear\r\nregime. In our opinion, the apparent reluctance of some\r\ncountries to comply with the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency safeguards system is not encouraging. We\r\ntherefore urge all those countries to join the international\r\ncommunity in the persistent effort to establish a safer\r\nworld.\r\nMy delegation also supports the concept of the\r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of\r\npeace throughout the world. We feel that the failure to\r\npromote this concept in all regions of the world is a clear\r\nindication of the doubt and suspicion that still prevail in the\r\ninternational community. Unless we can overcome these\r\nuncertainties the chances of achieving global disarmament\r\nwill indeed be bleak.\r\nAs we begin yet another session of discussions,\r\nconsultations and debates on ways and means of uniting our\r\nefforts and resources to make the world a safer place for\r\nmankind and to alleviate the terrible human suffering in\r\nmany countries, we should, I firmly believe, pause to\r\nassess the tremendous responsibility we carry. As\r\nrepresentatives of individual countries, we have to\r\nconsider our national interests; united, we have an\r\nunshakable commitment to giving undaunted and\r\nunwavering support to the process of making the United\r\nNations as effective as is humanly possible, to prevent the\r\nevolution of such tragic, dangerous and explosive\r\nsituations as those in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nThe question of Bosnia and Herzegovina has yet to\r\nbe resolved. We condemn the continuing violence and\r\ngenocide there, and call upon the international community\r\nto take more decisive steps to implement the Security\r\nCouncil’s resolutions in order to discharge fully the\r\nresponsibilities entrusted to us by the Charter and restore\r\nthe sovereignty and independence of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. Let us not tolerate in our time any act of\r\ngenocide based on ethnic hatred or prejudice.\r\nSimilarly, my delegation is deeply concerned about\r\nthe tragic situations continuing in Angola, Somalia and\r\nRwanda despite the fact that the United Nations is still\r\nproviding humanitarian assistance to alleviate the\r\nsuffering of their peoples. While commending the efforts\r\nof the international community to help these countries,\r\nwhich are being torn apart by civil strife, we feel that the\r\nassistance should not be limited to meeting humanitarian\r\nneeds, but should extend beyond that to restoring peace\r\nand stability in those countries, giving them another\r\nchance to rebuild their national economies.\r\nAs I observe the world economic situation I cannot\r\nbut feel considerable dismay at the fact that, despite the\r\nrecent conclusion of the seven-year Uruguay Round of\r\nnegotiations, the developing countries have not been\r\nprovided with much impetus to maintain economic growth\r\nin the face of the increasing gap between themselves and\r\nthe developed countries and of persistent protectionism in\r\ntrade.\r\nThe situation adversely affects the least-developed\r\ncountries most as they lack the resources to overcome the\r\nodds stacked against them. I feel that further\r\nintensification of South-South cooperation has become\r\nmore necessary, in order to harness their resources for\r\npurposes of assisting the less developed of the developing\r\ncountries and encouraging developmental efforts on the\r\nbasis of collective self-reliance. The United Nations and\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nthe international developmental and financial institutions\r\nshould encourage and support this process.\r\nAt the same time, the North-South dialogue must not\r\nbe allowed to be marginalized, since it is essential for the\r\ngrowth of a world economy on a firm foundation of\r\npartnership to promote common interests and benefits.\r\nWithout this basic element, the chances of promoting a\r\nstable world economy indeed seem bleak.\r\nAfter decades of protracted studies, research,\r\ndiscussions and debates, and then the resulting experience,\r\nwe are today in a position to appreciate fully that\r\ndevelopment is not simple. It can be achieved only through\r\na process that encompasses numerous attributes of human\r\nlife; education, health, the environment, peace, the\r\neconomy, society and culture and national and international\r\nbehaviour all contribute to its achievement.\r\nThe reviews and expert opinions gathered on the\r\nAgenda for Development, together with the recent sessions\r\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development, indicate\r\nthat intergovernmental cooperation involving the various\r\nagencies of the United Nations, regional organizations and\r\nnon-governmental organizations must contribute to laying\r\nthe groundwork for development. I do not foresee any easy\r\nor quick means of achieving development goals. While\r\nfurther detailed consideration is given to this multifaceted,\r\nall-important question, I should like to add my voice on the\r\nneed to bear in mind the great diversity in the levels of\r\nprogress that Member countries have been able to achieve,\r\nand the wide variation in the extent of resources that they\r\ncan invest in this venture, which is an inherent right of\r\nevery nation.\r\nAs the representative of a small island State, I pay\r\ntribute to all those responsible for the planning and\r\norganization of the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, which was\r\nheld in Barbados this year. I believe that appropriate\r\nrecognition has now been given to the special\r\nenvironmental and economic circumstances of small island\r\nStates in the context of achieving sustainable development.\r\nOne of the most important outcomes of this Conference\r\nwas a re-emphasis on the dire need of small island\r\ndeveloping States for the development of human resources.\r\nBut assessment of the need is only a prelude to the\r\nimplementation of any programme of action. What is\r\nrequired is sustained effort by the developing States and\r\ntechnical and other input by the developed countries and\r\ninternational organizations. In view of the Programme of\r\nAction and Declaration emanating from the Barbados\r\nConference, as well as Agenda 21, I need hardly\r\nemphasize the urgent need to stimulate positive responses\r\nby the international community with regard to assisting\r\nthe island developing States to improve the\r\nsocio-economic standards of their peoples in order to\r\nembark on plans for sustainable development.\r\nAt the same time, we are concerned at the speed at\r\nwhich international conferences are being held and\r\nambitious programmes of action being drawn up without\r\nsufficient resources to implement them. I make this\r\nstatement because of the experience we have had\r\nfollowing the United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development in Rio in 1992. The expectations which\r\nfollowed that conference have started to recede because\r\nof insufficient resources available to implement the\r\nprogramme of action. One of the most outstanding\r\nresults of the Conference was the creation of greater\r\nawareness of the environmental problems that the\r\ninternational community faces. At the same time, it is\r\ntragic to note that greater awareness of the predicament\r\non the part of those countries most susceptible to\r\nenvironmental damage only helps to increase\r\napprehensions of disaster and frustration.\r\nAs an island developing country, Maldives\r\nappreciates the tremendous achievement of the\r\ninternational community in establishing the rule of law on\r\nthe vast stretches of the high seas, which cover two thirds\r\nof the surface of the Earth. The fact that it took 12 long\r\nyears after its adoption for the Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea to enter into force is indeed a development that\r\nwill be written in letters of gold in the annals of world\r\nhistory.\r\nThe question of human rights should occupy a\r\ncentral place in our minds when we deal with all issues\r\nof global concern. The establishment of the post of\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is\r\ncertainly a most welcome step. But this step can have\r\nmeaningful results only if the necessary resources are\r\nprovided for the High Commissioner to carry out his\r\nmandate fairly and objectively, without any further\r\nfinancial burdens on the membership of this Organization.\r\nI would also like to emphasize here that, while the\r\nUniversal Declaration of 1948 may be the universal guide\r\nfor future work in this area, we must not attempt to lay\r\ndown rigidly uniform standards of human conduct and\r\nbehaviour for all societies without due respect for and\r\nregard to the diverse cultures and religions prevailing in\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nthe world. For it is the full understanding of this diversity\r\nthat reinforces the fabric of what we call international\r\nrelations and the unity of the membership of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe United Nations is being burdened with more and\r\nmore onerous responsibilities not only for the preservation\r\nand maintenance of international peace, security and\r\nstability, but for also assisting mankind in the realization\r\nof the goals of a safer world and a higher standard of living\r\nfor the generations to come.\r\nI remain convinced that if this universal Organization\r\nis to be successful in meeting the numerous challenges\r\nbefore it, every one of its Members must extend unstinting\r\nfinancial, technological, military and manpower-resource\r\nsupport to the Organization.\r\nWe cannot afford to be complacent, nor can we\r\ncondone any attempts to deflect the work of the United\r\nNations to any path other than that of right, justice and\r\nequality, as enshrined in the Charter.\r\nFor my part, I can only reiterate the sincere\r\ncommitment of the Government of the Republic of\r\nMaldives to supporting the United Nations and the\r\nprinciples of the Charter to the best of our ability. Only by\r\nso doing is there any hope of avoiding disastrous\r\nconsequences. What is more, the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Maldives implicitly trusts the United Nations\r\nas the guarantor of its security and as its protector.\r\nMr. Pálsson (Iceland): May I congratulate Foreign\r\nMinister Essy of Côte d’Ivoire on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. I am confident that he will steer our work to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion, and I pledge him the full support of\r\nmy delegation.\r\nI wish also to take this opportunity to express my\r\nGovernment’s satisfaction that South Africa, which now\r\ntakes its place as a full and respected member of the\r\ncommunity of nations, has been reinstated in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIt is a much-vaunted truth that the end of the cold war\r\nhas released the United Nations from the bondage of a\r\nworld obsessed with military security. But there is another\r\nchange at work - perhaps less abrupt but equally\r\nepoch-making - in the international system which has far-\r\nreaching implications for our world Organization. I refer\r\nto the progressive intertwining of the destinies of the\r\ndifferent peoples of the world, the globalization of the\r\nworld economy, the communications revolution and the\r\nincreasingly transnational nature of the issues of human\r\nsurvival, be they environmental problems, poverty,\r\nrefugees or population pressures, and the eroding capacity\r\nof the nation-State to address them single-handedly.\r\nGlobal interdependence is causing greater demands\r\nto be made on the United Nations than at any previous\r\ntime. The will to cooperate is gradually replacing the\r\nspirit of confrontation throughout the world. At the same\r\ntime, it is not clear that we have created an organization\r\nequal to the task of meeting the host of new demands.\r\nThough adept at analysing their sources, we are still\r\ninclined to deal with conflicts only after they arise instead\r\nof preventing them. The dangers we face may be novel,\r\nbut the structures we draw on to cope with them derive\r\nfrom a world that has largely vanished from view. Last\r\nbut not least, we saddle the United Nations with new\r\nresponsibilities without providing adequate resources to\r\ntackle them. In this way, a discrepancy has come about\r\nbetween our expectations of the United Nations and the\r\nability to deliver on them.\r\nWhile our main challenge should be to seek to\r\ntransform the United Nations into a more effective\r\ninstrument for dealing with issues that truly are beyond\r\nthe compass of the nation-State, we should also bear in\r\nmind that the United Nations was not designed to be a\r\nsubstitute for national Governments. Wherever possible\r\nthe United Nations should work with its Member States\r\nin areas where they are competent and draw to the\r\nmaximum extent possible on regional organizations. In\r\nso doing, we reduce the burden on the United Nations and\r\nfacilitate the setting of priorities.\r\nLooked at in this perspective, a number of\r\ndevelopments over the past 12 months give the United\r\nNations reason for encouragement. Democracy and the\r\nprinciples of the free market are making new inroads, and\r\nthe protection of human rights is gaining momentum in\r\nmany parts of the world. In Eastern Europe the process\r\nof democratic change is now irreversible. The negotiated\r\nwithdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic States has\r\nremoved from the European continent one of the last\r\nvestiges of the cold war. In Northern Ireland there is for\r\nthe first time since early this century a realistic chance of\r\nlasting peace and stability. In the Middle East the\r\nbreakthrough achieved last year has been consolidated\r\nwith the Gaza-Jericho Agreement and a peace accord\r\nbetween Israel and Jordan, hopefully paving the way for\r\na comprehensive peace settlement in the entire region.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nIn South Africa, the spirit of dialogue has finally\r\ntriumphed over the forces of hatred and racism, offering a\r\nmodel of tolerance for other countries on the troubled\r\nAfrican continent. In Western Sahara, there are brightening\r\nprospects, provided that all the relevant parties do their part\r\nin creating the necessary climate of confidence to enable\r\nthe people of Western Sahara to decide their own destiny\r\nin a democratic election.\r\nBut there have also been setbacks. Gross violations of\r\nhuman rights have continued in places as far apart as Haiti\r\nand East Timor. The tragic injustice in the former\r\nYugoslavia, the chaos in Somalia, as well as the terrible\r\ncarnage inflicted on the people of Rwanda by their own\r\ncompatriots, demonstrate the intractable nature of many of\r\nthe conflicts that our Organization is being called upon to\r\ndeal with. Unlike the inter-State conflicts which\r\ntraditionally have preoccupied the United Nations, these are\r\nconflicts taking place within the confines of the nation-\r\nState, where legitimate authority has either collapsed or\r\nbeen emaciated by civil strife. As the Organization adapts\r\nitself to the new demands of the post-cold-war era, ways\r\nmust be found to address such internal crises in full\r\nconformity with the United Nations Charter.\r\nTo heed this call, greater attention must now be\r\nconcentrated on the preventive dimension. Much effort has\r\nin recent years been devoted to peace-keeping, which now\r\nextends to non-military operations, including electoral\r\nassistance, the provision of humanitarian relief and human\r\nrights monitoring. This is as it should be, and countries\r\ncontributing substantially to such peace-keeping operations\r\ncertainly deserve both our gratitude and respect. At the\r\nsame time, we must make sure that the necessary resources\r\nare also allocated to development.\r\nOne of the lessons we have learned in recent years is\r\nthat we must focus more intently on the link between peace\r\nand development. Increasingly, we have come to\r\nunderstand that peace and security require solutions to\r\nsocial and economic problems, that without development\r\nthere can be no peace. In this connection, I wish to pay\r\nspecial tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, whose agenda for development, submitted\r\ntwo years after his pathbreaking Agenda for Peace, has\r\nsharpened our awareness of the need for creating an\r\ninfrastructure of peace.\r\nFor there to be a stable and lasting infrastructure of\r\npeace, a number of elements must be in place: a\r\ncommitment to democracy and respect for human rights, a\r\nsound social fabric, a growing economy and a sustainable\r\nnatural environment.\r\nAs a representative of one of the world’s oldest\r\ndemocracies — one which celebrates the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of its second republic this year — I cannot be\r\naccused of underrating the redeeming virtues of\r\ndemocracy, which, as was pointed out earlier in this\r\ndebate, fosters the greatest force behind social and\r\neconomic progress: individual creativity. Democracies,\r\nas a rule, also tend to honour human rights. By\r\npromoting tolerance and respect for the dignity of the\r\nindividual, we contribute to preventing cultural, ethnic\r\nand territorial conflicts. For good reason, human rights\r\nare therefore increasingly being considered as an integral\r\npart of the notion of extended security. It is thus to be\r\nregretted that the efforts of the United Nations in this\r\nimportant field continue to be strained due to lack of\r\nfinancial resources.\r\nThe effective implementation and monitoring of\r\nhuman rights standards, not least with respect to\r\nvulnerable groups, should be a matter of priority for the\r\nUnited Nations. The plight of children in some parts of\r\nthe world gives cause for grave concern. Four years ago,\r\nthe largest gathering of world political leaders assembled\r\nhere in this Hall of the General Assembly and endorsed\r\nthe principle that children should have the first call on the\r\nresources of society essential to their survival, protection\r\nand development. Next year we will assess how far we\r\nhave come in honouring the commitments undertaken by\r\nthe Summit for Children. At the same time we will be\r\ncelebrating the half-centenary of the United Nations. In\r\nthe view of my Government, this milestone event should\r\nbe used to give new impetus to efforts to ensure that\r\nchildren are given the best social conditions the world\r\ncommunity can offer.\r\nAs it happens, the fiftieth anniversary celebrations\r\nwill coincide with the Beijing Conference on the status of\r\nwomen. The timing is significant as the goals of\r\nachieving equality, empowerment and security for women\r\nare key to the social agenda of the United Nations as it\r\nmakes the transition into its second half-century.\r\nImproving the status of women is of paramount\r\nimportance for the well-being of the family, and has\r\npositive multiplier effects on overall levels of education,\r\nhealth and population growth in society as a whole.\r\nConversely, where society has broken down or social\r\nsafety-nets are inadequate, women assume the largest\r\nburden. There is therefore a direct link between the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nFourth World Conference on Women, the recent\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nheld in Cairo and the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Copenhagen next spring. The\r\nCopenhagen summit will afford us a much needed\r\nopportunity to focus attention on the social ills that\r\ncompromise the ability of nations to develop their full\r\npotential, be they poverty or disease, homelessness or\r\nhunger, joblessness or social exclusion, crime or violence.\r\nFifty years after the United Nations avowed in its Charter\r\nto promote social progress and better standards of living in\r\ngreater freedom, the time has come to put sustainable\r\nhuman development at the top of the Organization’s\r\nagenda.\r\nIn relieving the plight of the most underprivileged\r\nsegments of the world’s population, the role of economic\r\ngrowth can hardly be overstated. The abolition of trade\r\nbarriers is the single most important factor for world\r\neconomic growth. Just as a rising tide lifts the boats, so an\r\nincrease in world trade will create new jobs and raise\r\nincomes around the world. My Government therefore\r\nstrongly welcomes the establishment of the World Trade\r\nOrganization and urges other signatory States to ratify the\r\nUruguay-Round Agreement without undue delay.\r\nFocusing on economic progress must not, however,\r\nblind us to the need to keep an eye on other areas, which,\r\nif neglected, might strip us of the harvest of increased\r\nprosperity. One such area is the environment. Over the\r\npast few years the United Nations has made significant\r\nheadway in its efforts to promote sustainable development\r\nworldwide. The results of the Rio Conference on\r\nEnvironment and development provide a sound basis for\r\nfurther work. As we now assume the momentous task of\r\ndevelopment, measures must also be taken to protect the\r\nenvironment from detrimental patterns of production and\r\nconsumption.\r\nWhile recognizing the need to take a balanced view of\r\nthe ecosystem as a whole, Iceland remains particularly\r\nconcerned over the deteriorating condition of the world’s\r\noceans. It is a hopeful sign that the international\r\ncommunity has shown increasing awareness of the\r\nimportance of the sustainable utilization of the living\r\nresources of the sea. It has been estimated that the poorest\r\ntwo-thirds of the world’s population get about 40 percent of\r\ntheir protein from fish, and that food production must more\r\nthan double just to keep pace with the growth in demand in\r\nthe decades ahead. To meet this growth, it will be\r\nnecessary to rely not only on agriculture but also - and to\r\nan increasing extent - on the sustainable utilization of the\r\nliving resources of the sea.\r\nSuch considerations notwithstanding, the ecosystem\r\nof the sea is now in greater danger than ever before from\r\npollution and overfishing. Protecting the oceans against\r\nthe repercussions of economic and industrial expansion\r\nwill pose a major challenge to the international\r\ncommunity in the years ahead. Although much has been\r\naccomplished, existing conventions aimed at containing\r\nthe pollution of the marine environment cover only a part\r\nof the problem, as no global scheme addressing pollution\r\nfrom land-based activities is in place. For this reason,\r\nIceland attaches great importance to the Conference on\r\nthe Protection of the Marine Environment from\r\nLand-based Activities, to be convened in Washington next\r\nyear under the auspices of the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme. We urge all States and relevant\r\ninternational agencies to participate actively in the\r\npreparatory process, commencing officially in Reykjavik\r\nin March next year.\r\nThe responsible use of fisheries resources is,\r\nhowever, no less important than combatting the threat of\r\nmarine pollution. The universal acceptance of the\r\nsovereignty of the coastal State over its adjacent waters\r\nwas a necessary precondition of the effective management\r\nby the world community of the living resources of the\r\nsea. The application of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea, which extended the rule of law to\r\nover two thirds of the Earth’s surface, has contributed\r\nmore than any single undertaking to the furtherance of\r\nthat goal. Against this background, Iceland particularly\r\nwelcomes the fact that this Convention, a crowning\r\nachievement in the progressive development of\r\ninternational law under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, will come into force in only a few weeks’ time.\r\nMy country remains strongly committed to the\r\nestablishment of an international regime governing all\r\naspects of the utilization of living marine resources,\r\nincluding the high seas. For this reason, Iceland has\r\nactively supported the drafting of a legally binding and\r\ncomprehensive instrument that would ensure the effective\r\nmanagement and conservation of fisheries outside the\r\neconomic zone of the coastal State. In Iceland’s view,\r\nthis goal could best be achieved by establishing regional\r\nfisheries management organizations or arrangements open\r\nto States with legitimate interests in the relevant fisheries.\r\nSuch provisions should not, however, be understood as\r\nimplying approval of existing forms of cooperation based,\r\nin some instances, on unilateral decisions by a few States\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\naimed at excluding other neighbouring States,\r\nnotwithstanding the latter’s overwhelming dependence on\r\nand proximity to the fisheries in question. Indeed,\r\nunjustified discrimination would defeat the very aim of\r\nestablishing a new high seas fisheries regime for the benefit\r\nof all nations.\r\nThe global challenge of development calls for bold\r\nnew thinking, backed by the solid commitment of the\r\ninternational community to the goals enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. It also demands that we try to\r\nestablish consensus on the restructuring and reform of our\r\nOrganization in the near future. Efforts must be made to\r\nimprove the representational capacity and efficiency of the\r\nSecurity Council and at the same time preserve the\r\nconstitutional balance between the various organs of the\r\nOrganization, not least between the Council and the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe find ourselves on the threshold of a new era. Yet,\r\nwe are far from having rid ourselves completely of the\r\nlegacy of the cold war, which includes immense quantities\r\nof armaments and the technology for producing them. It\r\nwould certainly be disastrous if the recent transformation of\r\nthe international security environment were to be\r\nundermined by the growing proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nIn this connection, my Government deems it of the\r\nutmost importance that the Convention on chemical\r\nweapons enter into force next year and that the Convention\r\non Biological Weapons be further reinforced. In addition,\r\nthe indefinite and unconditional extension of the\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty would be the single most\r\nsignificant measure against the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons. This should be followed up by universal\r\nadherence to the nuclear-test moratorium and the conclusion\r\nof a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\r\nAs we inaugurate the second half-century of the\r\nUnited Nations, what better gift could the community of\r\nnations bestow on itself? And in what better way could we\r\nmake a clean break with the cold war era?\r\nMr. Acharya (Nepal): It is a special pleasure for me\r\nto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign\r\nMinister of Côte d’Ivoire, on his unanimous election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. We are confident that under his able leadership the\r\ndeliberations of this session will come to a fruitful\r\nconclusion. My delegation extends its full support to him\r\nin carrying out his important duties.\r\nI should also like to express my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to His Excellency Ambassador Samuel R.\r\nInsanally, the Permanent Representative of the Republic\r\nof Guyana to the United Nations, for successfully\r\npresiding over the General Assembly during its forty-\r\neighth session. I also take this opportunity to express my\r\nadmiration to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for the dedication, commitment and insight\r\nwith which he has been serving the United Nations.\r\nSince the end of the cold war the world community\r\nhas faced many developments, both encouraging and\r\ndisturbing. As a Vice-Chairman of the Special\r\nCommittee against Apartheid — now dissolved — Nepal\r\nfeels particularly happy about the end of the apartheid\r\nregime in South Africa. As President Mandela said in his\r\nspeech earlier in this session, it was one of the ironies of\r\nour age that it was only so late in the twentieth century\r\nthat such a regime came to an end. The United Nations\r\nrole in the establishment of a united democratic and\r\nnon-racist South Africa has been gratifying to all of us.\r\nThe end of apartheid represents progress on the part of\r\nmankind in its history of civilization. The statesmanship\r\nof President Mandela can be a source of inspiration for\r\nthose who are in search of freedom, peace and justice\r\nelsewhere in the world.\r\nNepal also welcomes the progress in the Middle\r\nEast peace process and looks forward to the establishment\r\nof comprehensive peace in the region. We hope that such\r\nachievements will inspire peoples in conflict with each\r\nother elsewhere to end their hostilities, and to start similar\r\npeace processes.\r\nThere are also disturbing areas of conflict. The\r\nNepalese people are grieved at the enormous loss of life\r\nand the extensive material devastation in Rwanda. It is\r\nour hope that with the active support of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) in conflict resolution, the United\r\nNations peace-keeping efforts will facilitate the process of\r\nrestoring normalcy and a peaceful civil society in\r\nRwanda.\r\nNepal also appreciates the role played by the OAU\r\nin Burundi in terms of conflict prevention, management\r\nand resolution. We hope that the OAU mechanism will\r\nbe applied effectively to other troubled parts of the region\r\nsuch as Somalia, Angola and Liberia, in order to restore\r\nnormalcy.\r\nNepal is also deeply distressed by the tragedy which,\r\ndespite the Security Council’s resolutions, continues\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nunabated in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We would like to\r\nurge all the parties concerned to seek peace through\r\ndialogue and negotiation rather than through violence.\r\nNepal also looks forward to an early restoration of the\r\ndemocratically elected Government in Haiti, which alone\r\ncan ensure full respect for human rights in that country.\r\nWe are meeting on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations, which will be a time for us to reflect\r\non the past five decades and plan for the next 50 years.\r\nBorn as a result of the Second World War, the United\r\nNations has over the past five decades ceaselessly deployed\r\nefforts to prevent a third world war. Disarmament,\r\nespecially nuclear disarmament, has therefore been one of\r\nits major concerns. The United Nations also made constant\r\nefforts to bring peace to the Middle East and to put an end\r\nto apartheid in South Africa, and it remained engaged in\r\nmany other areas of conflict. However, the last five\r\ndecades, characterized by the cold war, almost paralysed\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe East-West divide seriously hampered the United\r\nNations efforts in most conflict situations. A number of\r\nimportant agreements were reached and many peace\r\nnegotiations were held outside the United Nations.\r\nNevertheless, those achievements were in conformity with\r\nthe spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, and the\r\nUnited Nations provided an important global forum for\r\ndiscussion, which helped defuse major global catastrophes.\r\nThus, in the ultimate analysis, the United Nations has\r\nundoubtedly made significant contributions to international\r\nrelations. Moreover, the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies and other related bodies, such as the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund, the World Health Organization, the United\r\nNations Population Fund, the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations and many others, have\r\nbeen engaged in improving social and economic conditions\r\naround the world.\r\nSince the cold war, whose enormous cost adversely\r\naffected the lives of billions of people, is now over, we at\r\nthe United Nations, standing — as it were — at the\r\ncrossroads of history, can now define the Organization’s\r\nrole and work for the next 50 years.\r\nWith such rapid changes taking place in international\r\nrelations, particularly in recent years, the United Nations\r\nneeds to be restructured and revitalized. The restructuring\r\nof the Security Council has assumed a particular urgency.\r\nNepal strongly supports an increase in the membership of\r\nthe Council to reflect, not only the increase in the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations, but also the reality of\r\nthe present world. A review of the Council’s membership\r\nhas also to take into account the contributions of Member\r\nStates to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. We attach a high priority to greater\r\ntransparency and openness in the Council’s work, and\r\nalso attach great importance to the principle of equitable\r\nrepresentation, which would give all United Nations\r\nMembers — large or small, rich or poor, powerful or\r\nweak — a reasonable opportunity to contribute to the\r\nwork of the Council.\r\nWe hope that the work of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Security Council and related issues will be\r\nfruitful in due time. Our delegation considers that the\r\nreform and expansion of the Security Council should also\r\ninclude measures geared to reforming its working\r\nmethods and procedures. In addition, there is a need to\r\nenhance the relationship between the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly, in accordance with the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe changed context of international relations and\r\nthe United Nations preoccupation with peace-keeping\r\noperations should not be allowed to deflect attention from\r\nefforts to achieve general and complete disarmament\r\nunder effective international control. Rather, the\r\npropitious climate now prevailing calls for strengthening\r\nthe role of the United Nations in arms control and\r\ndisarmament. In this context, I wish to recall the\r\nunanimous political support expressed by the General\r\nAssembly at its last session for the decision of the\r\nConference on Disarmament to give to its Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee on a Nuclear Test Ban a mandate to negotiate\r\nsuch a ban. To this end, the Non-Aligned Movement, of\r\nwhich Nepal is a founding member, has called for a\r\nspecial session of the United Nations General Assembly\r\non disarmament in order to undertake a comprehensive\r\nassessment of progress towards global disarmament.\r\nLike the rest of the international community, Nepal\r\nlooks forward to the early conclusion of a comprehensive\r\ntreaty prohibiting nuclear tests in all atmospheres. A non-\r\ndiscriminatory and effectively verifiable test-ban treaty\r\nwould have a positive impact on the success of the\r\nConference on the review and extension of the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is due\r\nto be held in 1995.\r\nIn addition to pursuing confidence-building\r\nmeasures, the United Nations role in arms control and\r\ndisarmament needs to be effectively strengthened. In this\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\ncontext, the United Nations Regional Centres for Peace and\r\nDisarmament can play an important role, as they provide\r\nmuch-needed forums for the exchange of views. The United\r\nNations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in\r\nAsia and the Pacific has already held several meetings to\r\npromote such a process of dialogue and interaction.\r\nNepal is firm in its conviction that peace-keeping\r\noperations, though extremely important, especially in this\r\npost-cold-war period, are no substitute for the peaceful\r\nresolution of conflicts through political dialogue and\r\nmediation. Application of Chapter VII of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations in the restoration and maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security should be invoked by the\r\nSecurity Council only as a last resort, fully respecting the\r\nprinciples of impartiality and non-selectivity. Nepal has\r\nsupported fully the Secretary-General’s initiative in\r\nexpanding preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution.\r\nWe have consistently committed our troops to the peace-\r\nkeeping operations undertaken by the United Nations\r\nthrough the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and\r\nthe United Nations Protection Force.\r\nBesides serving in Cambodia during the critical stage\r\nof democratic elections there, Nepal has also sent civilian\r\npolice monitors for electoral assistance in Mozambique.\r\nNepal has also sent troops to Somalia, despite the heavy\r\nloss of life and casualties suffered by our young men. We\r\nwould like to pay tribute to those Nepalese soldiers and to\r\nthe others who gave their lives in the relentless pursuit of\r\ninternational peace and security. Prime Minister\r\nGiri ja Prasad Koirala, in a recent statement to the\r\nroundtable on United Nations peace-keeping operations in\r\nKathmandu, stated:\r\n“While the Government (of Nepal) has raised its\r\nvoice at the United Nations and in appropriate\r\ninternational forums for more effective mechanisms\r\nfor the safety and protection of our personnel, the\r\nGovernment reaffirms its commitment to continue to\r\nparticipate in such operations with a sense of\r\nresponsibility and solemn obligation.”\r\nSince peace-keeping operations have become more\r\ncomplicated and more expensive in recent years, there is\r\ngreater urgency to make those operations cost-effective and\r\nefficient. Peace-keeping contributions must be paid in full\r\nand on time so that the troop — contributing countries may\r\nbe in a better position to maintain the most critical element\r\nin peace-keeping operations — the troops. My Government\r\nholds the firm view that the death and disability\r\ncompensation to all troops should he based on equity. We\r\nhope to review the current guidelines on this matter in\r\norder to arrive at a standard compensation package\r\napplicable to all.\r\nEvery peace-keeping operation should be devised\r\nwith a clear mandate, a realistic time frame and a correct\r\nassessment of the situation. Furthermore, we would like\r\nto reiterate that timely consultations with troop-\r\ncontributing countries are essential elements for the\r\nenhancement of the peace-keeping capability of the\r\nUnited Nations. Nepal welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiative on stand-by arrangements for peace-keeping.\r\nWe are studying the proposal seriously, especially in view\r\nof current events that highlight the need for the\r\nestablishment of such an arrangement.\r\nSince the threat to security lies, inter alia, in\r\nnon-military sources such as the lack of economic and\r\nsocial development, Nepal stresses the need for timely\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 for ensuring the\r\nsustainability of the planet for present and future\r\ngenerations. The Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment has made a good start. It must not be\r\nallowed to falter or to be turned into a discussion forum\r\nonly. The Commission should build a bridge between the\r\nNorth and the South to enable the developing countries to\r\nfollow the path of sustainable development. By providing\r\nadditional financial resources and transferring\r\nenvironmentally sound technology to developing\r\ncountries, the international community can surely reach\r\nthe goals set in Agenda 21. In our view, the level of\r\nconsumption and wastage in most industrialized countries\r\nalso needs to be moderated if we are to achieve the goals\r\nof sustainable development.\r\nThe success of population and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment programmes hinges on the full\r\nempowerment of women. The focus given to the\r\nempowerment of women in decision-making, especially\r\nin planning the size of a family, at the recent International\r\nConference on Population and Development is a mater of\r\nsatisfaction to my delegation. However, the success of\r\nthe Plan of Action as adopted requires increased financial\r\nresources. The developing countries, despite their severe\r\nresource constraints, have been committing significant\r\namounts in population activities at the cost of other\r\nimportant areas that are required for economic growth and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThat important conference will be followed by the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, the fourth World\r\nConference on Women and the 1996 United Nations\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II). This year\r\nalone, we have participated in many important conferences:\r\non natural disaster reduction, on the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island States, on combating\r\ndesertification and drought, and on population and\r\ndevelopment. A question remains outstanding: that of the\r\navailability of the critical resources for the successful\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of these\r\nconferences. The developing countries find themselves in\r\nan exasperating situation, trying to cope with their\r\nresponsibilities, as outlined in previous agreements and\r\nresolutions, without the necessary actions from the\r\nindustrialized countries.\r\nNepal fully shares the Secretary-General’s view that\r\nan alternative to the United Nations in the field of\r\ndevelopment simply does not exist, especially in the light\r\nof the new vision of development as inextricably linked\r\nwith peace and security. We reiterate our view that there\r\nmust be close cooperation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. The\r\nmain objectives of the proposed agenda for development\r\nshould he directed towards ensuring successful\r\nimplementation of existing programmes for the alleviation\r\nof poverty. The agenda should be an instrument that looks\r\nafter the most vulnerable and the weakest nations of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the signing\r\nof the agreements at Marrakesh undoubtedly constitute a\r\nhistoric breakthrough in the international trade regime. The\r\nwindow of opportunity is now open for many developing\r\ncountries to enhance their trade and development. Once\r\nagain, the least developed countries will be left out, in spite\r\nof this tremendous opportunity now available to many. The\r\nlack of basic physical infrastructure and the absence of a\r\nmanufacturing base will prevent the least developed\r\ncountries from taking advantage of this new opportunity.\r\nThe least developed countries, including my own country,\r\nhave suffered for decades. These handicaps, however, have\r\nnot deterred us from our determination to cooperate fully\r\nwith the international community by instituting structural\r\nadjustment programmes and economic liberalization\r\npolicies, including privatization.\r\nStructural adjustment programmes lacking due\r\nconsideration for social safety nets have pushed a large\r\nsector of the world’s population towards more misery and\r\ndiscontent. Economic liberalization programmes without\r\nadequate institutional and organizational set-ups have not\r\nyielded the desired results in many countries. The major\r\npurpose of the privatization programmes undertaken by\r\nmany developing countries — the efficient and productive\r\nuse of resources — has yet to be fulfilled. At the same\r\ntime, it may be appreciated that these inadequate\r\nmeasures, resulting in higher inflation, a distorted market\r\nsystem and increasing unemployment, may result in\r\ngreater social tension.\r\nWe are happy to note that in the context of the\r\nfollow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action,\r\nan open-ended Working Group of the Third Committee\r\nhas been established; we hope it will review the mandates\r\nof existing human rights machinery, taking into account\r\nthe balanced emphasis between civil, political, cultural,\r\neconomic and social rights, as well as improving human\r\nrights on the basis of the principles of impartiality,\r\nobjectivity and non-selectivity.\r\nViolation or suppression of human rights within a\r\nnation’s boundary have consequences outside its\r\nboundaries as well. People unable to live in conditions\r\nwhere human rights are suppressed are forced to flee their\r\nown homelands and take refuge elsewhere. United\r\nNations agencies such as the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food\r\nProgramme, and international and non-governmental\r\nhumanitarian organizations, are well aware of this. My\r\ndelegation would like to commend the work of these\r\nUnited Nations agencies. We also feel that the agencies\r\nmust be mandated to serve all the people in such difficult\r\nsituations.\r\nThe Constitution of Nepal enshrines the principle of\r\nuniversal human rights. We believe that the right to\r\ndevelopment is an integral part of human rights. Nepal\r\nis now party to 14 international human rights instruments,\r\nincluding all the major Conventions and Covenants. A\r\nnational action plan on human rights is being prepared in\r\nline with the final document of the Vienna Conference on\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nNepal is also consolidating the multi-party\r\ndemocratic system that was restored by the people\r\nthrough a popular movement in 1990. Nepal participated\r\nactively in the Second International Conference of New\r\nor Restored Democracies, at Managua, Nicaragua, in July\r\nthis year. The Conference provided us with an\r\nopportunity to share each other’s experience of nascent\r\ndemocracy. In November this year the people of Nepal\r\nare participating in our second general elections on the\r\nbasis of adult franchise. We are confident that this\r\nexercise in democracy will give an impetus to the long-\r\nterm economic development of our country.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations captures the highest\r\nideals of mankind. However, much remains to be done to\r\nput those ideals into practice. We look forward to\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations as the\r\noccasion to work for instituting dynamism and efficiency\r\nin the United Nations. My delegation is fully confident\r\nthat our vision of the United Nations as a symbol of\r\npeace, security, human rights and development will be\r\nrealized if Member States demonstrate the political will\r\nand provide the necessary financial and material support\r\nto the Organization.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
