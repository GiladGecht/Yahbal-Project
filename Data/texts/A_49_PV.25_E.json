(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The first\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Tourism of\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Alpian Allen. I now call on him.\r\nMr. Allen (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): As we\r\nprepare to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding\r\nof the United Nations, the memory of the cold war is\r\nfading rapidly from our minds. We recall the nostalgia\r\nwith which we heralded the end of the era and the\r\nconcomitant universal aspirations to a world of peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\nThe world has witnessed the triumph of democracy in\r\nseveral areas and the resolution of conflicts that had\r\noriginated in a war maintained by the earlier East-West\r\nconfrontation. However, the images of violence, famine\r\nand destruction that flicker daily on our television screens\r\nsuggest some urgency for the world community to attempt\r\nto put an end to the violence and the senseless destruction\r\nof human lives.\r\nIt is against this backdrop, Sir, that we welcome\r\nsomeone with your wide diplomatic experience and wisdom\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. I am confident that you will make an important\r\ncontribution to the further success of our deliberations on\r\nthe vital and major issues of our time.\r\nYour predecessor, our Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) and West Indian brother Ambassador\r\nSamuel R. Insanally, has established a superb record of\r\nachievements, on which I would like to congratulate him\r\nwarmly.\r\nAt this juncture in the history of the United Nations,\r\nour Organization is fortunate to have a Secretary-General\r\nlike Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a person eminently suited\r\nby training and disposition to guide the membership of\r\nthis body towards a new era of peace and prosperity that\r\nwe hope will emerge from the debris of the cold war.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to welcome the\r\nnew South Africa into our midst as an equal Member of\r\nthe Organization, ready to participate in all its activities\r\nin accordance with the purposes and the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. We now join the courageous\r\npeople of South Africa as they celebrate with happiness\r\nand pride their victory over the struggle of the century:\r\nthe fight against apartheid. At long last they have rid\r\nthemselves of the shackles of that abominable crime and\r\nhave finally removed the greatest blemish from the\r\ncontinent of Africa. We congratulate Mr. Nelson\r\nMandela and salute his determined march from prison to\r\nPresident. He symbolizes the aspirations of the South\r\nAfrican people and the values of non-racialism,\r\ndemocracy and peace. Indeed, this is a lesson in\r\nperseverance and faith in the human spirit.\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nThe voice of the international community was clearly\r\nheard as it worked to mobilize public opinion against the\r\ninjustice of apartheid, and we are now greatly relieved that\r\nthe question of its elimination will finally be removed from\r\nthe agenda of succeeding session of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation hailed the historic Agreement on\r\nmutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization, which was signed on\r\n13 September 1993 in Washington, D.C. We also\r\nwelcomed the historic breakthrough that gave impetus to an\r\noverall Arab-lsraeli settlement when Prime Minister Yitzak\r\nRabin and Jordan’s King Hussein met in Washington last\r\nJuly and laid the foundation for the establishment of a\r\npeace treaty between the two countries. The international\r\ncommunity must also be heartened by the establishment of\r\ndiplomatic relations between Israel and Morocco and by an\r\napparent thaw in relations between Israel and Syria. We\r\nare all looking forward with great anticipation to the\r\ncommencement of negotiations between the two\r\nGovernments. It is our hope that these initiatives signal the\r\nbeginning of the end of one of the longest standing and\r\nmost intractable conflicts of our time and that they herald\r\nan era of peace, security and political stability in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nThe recent peace overtures in the Middle East are yet\r\nanother demonstration of the dramatic changes in\r\ninternational relations that have taken place since the\r\ncollapse of communism and the end of the cold war. In\r\nthis context my Government is optimistic that the still-\r\nunresolved major international political issues will be\r\nsimilarly settled. I refer in particular to the problem of\r\nNorth and South Korea and that of the People’s Republic\r\nof China and the Republic of China in Taiwan.\r\nIt is the view of the delegation of Saint Vincent and\r\nthe Grenadines that the time has come when serious\r\nconsideration should be given the eligibility of the Republic\r\nof China in Taiwan to become a Member of the United\r\nNations. That is why my Government, in association with\r\nother like-minded countries, requested the Secretary-General\r\nto include an item on the agenda of the forty-ninth session\r\nof the General Assembly entitled “Consideration of the\r\nexceptional situation of the Republic of China in Taiwan in\r\nthe international context, based on the principle of\r\nuniversality and in accordance with the established model\r\nof parallel representation of divided countries at the United\r\nNations.” We trust that this item will soon secure a place\r\non the agenda of the General Assembly and that when it\r\ndoes every Member State of this noble institution will give\r\nits full support to this initiative. We cannot preach about\r\nthe universality of the United Nations while at the same\r\ntime we ignore the aspirations of over 20 million people\r\nin the Republic of China on Taiwan.\r\nCertain present-day international political trends, as\r\nI mentioned earlier, give us renewed encouragement and\r\nhope of relations being conducted between and within\r\nStates in accordance with the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter. This, however, does not\r\nmean that the world is now free from tension and\r\ninternational disputes.\r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a\r\npersistent crisis which continues to shock us all. Efforts\r\nmade to date by the international community to halt the\r\naggression by Serbia and Montenegro and to settle the\r\ncrisis by peaceful means have been in vain. The\r\nGovernment of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines regrets\r\nthat the recent proposals for a political settlement of the\r\nconflict have been rejected by the Bosnian Serbs. That\r\nrejection carries with it the danger of the continuation and\r\neven grave escalation of the conflict. We urge the\r\nBosnian Serbs to accept the proposals of the Contact\r\nGroup and to resolve their remaining differences in the\r\nspirit of peaceful negotiation and reconciliation, thus\r\ntaking irreversible steps towards a just and durable peace\r\nin Bosnia.\r\nAs a country blessed with freedom and the absence\r\nof racial and religious bigotry, we will always raise our\r\nvoice against any form of “ethnic cleansing”. We also\r\nlook forward to the reunification of Cyprus and to the\r\ndeparture of foreign occupation troops from all countries.\r\nThe vicious cycle of starvation, violence, the\r\nbreakdown of central authority, and endless conflicts\r\ncontinues to bedevil in varying ways the situation in\r\nSomalia, Zaire, Angola, Liberia, Mozambique, Burundi\r\nand Rwanda. We call upon the United Nations to\r\ncontinue its struggle to establish peace in these areas.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines places a high\r\nvalue on its relations with the Americas since we are part\r\nof the same hemisphere. We share the same burning\r\ndesire for meaningful economic, political and social\r\ndevelopment. Over the past decade there has been a\r\nnoticeable and commendable trend towards democratic\r\nrule.\r\nThe Convention establishing the Association of\r\nCaribbean States, which was signed at Cartagena on\r\n24 July 1994, represents an achievement in the areas of\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\neconomic cooperation and regional integration, with the\r\nultimate objective of launching new opportunities for the\r\npursuit of collective initiatives by 40 Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States, comprising some 200 million people and\r\nunited by the waters of the Caribbean. The further\r\nstrengthening of the inter-American system remains a major\r\nobjective of the Government of Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines.\r\nMy delegation is very pleased that the use of force\r\nwas averted in Haiti and that, at long last, democracy and\r\nconstitutional legitimacy will be returned to that land. We\r\nare equally delighted to learn that General Cedras has\r\ndecided to relinquish power, thus paving the way for the\r\nreturn of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\r\nMy delegation wishes to commend President Clinton\r\nfor the leadership and determination he has shown in\r\nsupport of the international community’s effort to restore\r\ndemocracy to Haiti and hope and dignity to the Haitian\r\npeople. The Government of Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines will continue to be an active participant in all\r\narrangements aimed at ensuring the safe return of President\r\nAristide and in the eventual rebuilding process.\r\nAmong the goals that the founding fathers of the\r\nUnited Nations set for the Organization were promoting\r\n“social progress and better standards of life in larger\r\nfreedom”\r\nand recognizing development as an inalienable right of\r\nmankind. Regrettably, third-world countries like Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines feel very strongly that this goal\r\nhas so far been very elusive. With the end of the cold war\r\nand the relative success of the United Nations in its peace-\r\nkeeping, peacemaking and peace-enforcement roles, the\r\ninternational community must now attempt to grapple more\r\nseriously with the developmental problems faced by third-\r\nworld countries.\r\nIf countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are\r\nto survive in this harsh world environment, careful and\r\nurgent consideration must be given by the international\r\ncommunity to the following measures: first, revitalizing\r\ngrowth in developed countries; secondly, liberalizing trade,\r\nespecially to give market access to the products of\r\ndeveloping countries; thirdly, reducing debt and the debt-\r\nservice burden; fourthly, reversing the deteriorating\r\nmarketing situation for the primary products of developing\r\ncountries; fifthly, increasing official development assistance\r\nand humanitarian aid; and sixthly, creating a sensitivity to\r\nthe reduction in net capital flows from bilateral and\r\nmultilateral sources, as well as to the negative\r\nconsequences of the graduation of some countries, such\r\nas ours, from concessionary funding arrangements of a\r\nnumber of multilateral institutions.\r\nThe changing world environment dictates the need\r\nfor the revitalization and restructuring of the various\r\norgans of the United Nations. At the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\r\ncalled for enlargement of the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil to reflect the current global reality. Today we\r\nrepeat that call.\r\nMy Government attaches very high priority to\r\nrevitalizing and strengthening the role of the United\r\nNations in the promotion of international cooperation for\r\neconomic and social development. We share the view\r\nthat the United Nations should be encouraged to develop\r\nits full potential in the area of international economic\r\ncooperation and should be endowed with the necessary\r\nresources to enable it to contribute to solving the serious\r\neconomic and social problems facing developing countries\r\nin their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines hopes that the\r\nSecretary-General’s Agenda for Development, together\r\nwith the conclusions of, and the follow-up to, the Rio\r\nConference and the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, which\r\nwas held in Barbados, as well as summits and\r\nconferences such as the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen and the Second United Nations Conference on\r\nHuman Settlements, will all contribute to better\r\nunderstanding of the problems faced by developing\r\ncountries and assist the evolution of a global consensus\r\nand the mobilization of adequate resources to address\r\nthese problems effectively.\r\nWe do not, however, support the creation of new\r\nbureaucracies. There are already enough institutions.\r\nWhat we need are better terms and a speedier reaction to\r\nestablished needs.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines continues to be\r\nplagued by the modern-day problem of the illicit\r\nproduction, trafficking and consumption of drugs and\r\npsychotropic substances. This scourge poses a serious\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nthreat to the well-being of our people and threatens to\r\ndestroy the social and moral fabric of our communities.\r\nThe archipelagic nature of our State, its many bays\r\nand cays and the mountainous terrain and rich alluvial soil\r\nof mainland Saint Vincent are characteristics that attract\r\nmany visitors to our shores and provide scarce foreign\r\nexchange to assist us in the development of our country.\r\nThese very features, however, operate against us in our war\r\nagainst the illicit production of drugs and their distribution\r\nby drug barons and their associates. Due to our limited\r\nresources, we are unable to police and control our borders\r\nand coastlines effectively.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines supports every\r\nsingle measure taken by the United Nations to cope with\r\nthis serious problem, and calls for continued efforts to\r\neliminate this global scourge.\r\nAt the local level, we have been taking forceful steps\r\nto confront this evil — pursuing a dynamic drug-abuse-\r\nprevention drive and at the same time launching major\r\nadministrative, legislative and judicial initiatives against the\r\nmarketing and trafficking of drugs.\r\nMy country has viewed with great interest the\r\nmeasures taken by the Secretary-General to revitalize the\r\nUnited Nations so that it is better prepared to attain the\r\nobjectives of the Charter. In particular, I wish to\r\nemphasize the active peace-keeping role of the Organization\r\nin the resolution of conflicts that originated before the end\r\nof the cold war and of new tensions emerging in hot spots\r\naround the world. The peace-keeping forces operating\r\nunder the United Nations flag perform a fundamental role\r\nby paving the way to dialogue and negotiation, thus\r\npreventing prolonged confrontations.\r\nWe wholeheartedly support this major peace-keeping,\r\npeacemaking and peace-enforcing thrust of the United\r\nNations. However, we feel that the criteria used in\r\nfinancing the forces involved must be re-examined. The\r\ncost of such operations is beginning to prove quite\r\nburdensome for both the Organization and its Member\r\nStates, especially those, like Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, with a limited resource base. We look forward\r\nto efforts to alleviate the financial burden placed on small\r\ndeveloping States by the frequent deployment of such\r\noperations.\r\nToday, as we prepare to mark an important milestone\r\nin the history of the United Nations, and as we approach\r\nthe beginning of the twenty-first century, we look forward\r\nto a world where democracy, peace, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and human welfare are be available to all.\r\nMankind has spent almost half a century in pursuit of\r\nthese goals. Let us continue the struggle and never tire\r\nin its pursuit.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the next speaker, the Minister for External\r\nRelations of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Gombosuren (Mongolia): May I offer you,\r\nSir, our sincere congratulations on your election to the\r\nhigh post of President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session. We are confident that under your\r\nable guidance the General Assembly will make significant\r\nprogress on the important issues before it.\r\nWe express our deep gratitude to Ambassador\r\nSamuel Insanally of Guyana for his admirable work\r\nduring his presidency.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to extend our heartfelt\r\nfelicitations to the Republic of South Africa, which has\r\nbegun its advancement along the road of democracy by\r\ndismantling the apartheid regime of racial discrimination\r\nand has assumed its rightful place in the community of\r\nnations. This historic event testifies to the fact that the\r\npurposes and principles that guide the United Nations,\r\nincluding that of respect for human rights, can be\r\ntranslated into reality.\r\nA number of other meaningful positive developments\r\nhave taken place on the international scene over the last\r\nyear, events that are inextricably linked to the tortuous\r\nemergence of a new atmosphere in the wake of the cold\r\nwar. None the less, instability continues to plague\r\nvarious corners of the globe, bearing witness to the\r\nextreme difficulty of finding solutions to problems; hence\r\nthe urgent need to harmonize our efforts and enhance the\r\nrole of the United Nations.\r\nThe international community is on the threshold of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. As part of\r\nthe world-wide preparations for this event, a committee\r\nhas been established in Mongolia to coordinate national\r\nactivities. The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\ncoincides with the demise of the cold war, the advent of\r\na new era of mutual trust and partnership among nations\r\nand the emergence of unprecedented opportunities to\r\nimplement the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter. This anniversary will serve as an\r\nimportant moment of reflection on the Organization’s\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\npast, the lessons from both its successes and its failures and\r\nthe tasks ahead of us. The world community expects the\r\nanniversary session next year to be crowned by the\r\nadoption at the summit level of a visionary document\r\nembodying its hopes and aspirations and outlining\r\nmeaningful objectives for the new millennium. It is against\r\nthis background that we see the special significance of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly, which is to lay a sound\r\nfoundation for the anniversary.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report entitled “An Agenda\r\nfor Development” is a highlight of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation expresses its\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for producing a\r\nthought-provoking report which offers a comprehensive\r\napproach to development and innovative ideas for\r\nconsideration. We hope that the upcoming discussion of\r\nthat report will help in the search for an adequate response\r\nto persistent inequalities and imbalances, as well as ways to\r\ncombat the abject poverty, external debt burden and\r\nenvironmental degradation that negatively affect the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\n“An Agenda for Development” is expected to promote\r\npeople-centred sustainable development through, inter alia,\r\na meaningful North-South partnership. In this connection,\r\nit would be advisable that the targets of earmarking 0.7 per\r\ncent of the industrialized countries’ gross national product\r\n(GNP) for official development assistance and allocating 20\r\nper cent of that assistance for human priority concerns be\r\nreflected in that “Agenda”. We also wish to see included\r\nin the “Agenda” the idea of allocating 20 per cent of the\r\nbudget of the developing countries for the aforementioned\r\npurpose. An active South-South cooperation is of vital\r\nimportance for the sustainable development and self-\r\nreliance of the developing countries. In this regard the\r\nestablishment of the South Centre will have a significant\r\nbearing on the strengthening of the foundations of such\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe problems facing the countries in transition and the\r\nneed for international cooperation to overcome them have\r\nfound, in our view, a proper reflection in the “Agenda”. In\r\norder to ensure the success of transition, which has a direct\r\nbearing on the future of world developments, it is only fair\r\nthat greater attention be given to enhancing the\r\neffectiveness of international cooperation towards that end.\r\nFurthermore, this cooperation should be tailored to the\r\nyspecific conditions of countries in transition. In the case\r\nof Mongolia, aside from such handicaps as a low level of\r\ndevelopment and a disadvantageous geographical location,\r\nour economy, in fact, finds itself dependent on another\r\ncrisis-stricken country in transition.\r\nWe believe that the time has come to make every\r\neffort to resolve the external debt problem of developing\r\ncountries, taking into account the vital interests of their\r\nsocio-economic development and the urgent need to lay\r\nthe foundation for equitable economic cooperation. On\r\nthe other hand, it is incumbent upon the creditor nations\r\nto display the political will to deal resolutely with that\r\nintractable problem. One might add that the realistic\r\nassessment of the underlying political and economic\r\ncauses of the multiplying debt burden should be borne in\r\nmind in addressing this issue.\r\nThe successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round\r\nand the ensuing decision to create the World Trade\r\nOrganization represent an important step towards a fairer\r\ntrading system.\r\nWe hope that the entry into force of the Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea will facilitate the solution of\r\nproblems confronting, above all, the least developed, land-\r\nlocked and geographically disadvantaged States.\r\nThe post-Rio period has registered a welcome shift\r\ntowards the broadening of international cooperation in\r\naddressing environmental issues. Nevertheless, we have\r\nto admit that there is a significant disparity between the\r\nimportance that the international community attaches to\r\nthis problem and the actual results of the work done in\r\nprotecting the environment and halting the ecological\r\ncrisis and remedying its consequences. In this regard, I\r\nwish to emphasize that commitments, especially those\r\nrelated to the flow of financial resources and the transfer\r\nof technology, have to be faithfully honoured.\r\nAs a country exposed to drought and desertification,\r\nMongolia welcomes the conclusion of the negotiations on,\r\nand the signing of, the international Convention to combat\r\ndesertification.\r\nThe convening of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in Copenhagen next year is a clear\r\nmanifestation of the fact that social issues are being\r\nbrought to the centre of the international agenda. We\r\ntrust that the Summit will serve as a powerful engine for\r\nmarshalling political will at the highest level and will\r\nbring about a viable action programme to effectively\r\naddress social challenges. This Summit, taken together\r\nwith the recent International Conference on Population\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nand Development and the future conferences on women and\r\non human settlements constitute an intertwined continuous\r\nprocess of international consensus building.\r\nMongolia is advancing along the road of reforms,\r\nrelying on the active support of the donor community and\r\nof international organizations. The International Monetary\r\nFund-supported enhanced structural adjustment facility\r\nprogramme is in its second year of implementation. There\r\nis a positive trend towards checking economic decline and\r\ninflation and stabilizing the national currency. The role of\r\nthe private sector in the national economy is growing\r\nconsiderably. Relying on the experience of the years of\r\ntransition, we are on our way to finding effective ways and\r\nmeans for the State-governed economy. A great deal has\r\nbeen accomplished in laying down the legal foundations for\r\nsocietal life.\r\nYet underlying problems continue to persist. At times,\r\nwe face a situation in which one problem succeeds another.\r\nThe fuel and energy sector is in a critical state. The living\r\nstandards of the population continue to decline; poverty and\r\nunemployment are on the rise. There is a severe shortage\r\nof internal financial resources.\r\nIn order to make substantive progress in overcoming\r\nthese and other difficulties, foreign aid will continue to play\r\na decisive role for some time to come. In this respect, we\r\nare looking forward to the fourth donor meeting to be held\r\nin Tokyo this November. As hardships seem to persist, the\r\npractice of holding regular donor meetings under the\r\nauspices of Japan and the World Bank remains essential.\r\nWe trust that we will receive support and understanding\r\nfrom the parties concerned.\r\nHowever, this is not to say that we are pursuing a\r\nlopsided approach to overcoming the crisis and\r\nimplementing structural economic adjustments, relying\r\nsolely on outside assistance and ideas. It goes without\r\nsaying that the only way, eventually, is in the development\r\nof equitable and mutually advantageous cooperation.\r\nProceeding from this premise, we endeavour to attract\r\nforeign investment, including private investment, and to\r\ncreate the necessary legal, economic and other conditions.\r\nFor any State, and for small States in particular, peace\r\nand stability in their respective regions are of vital\r\nimportance. By and large, positive trends are prevailing in\r\nour region, despite the continued existence of hotbeds of\r\nconflict and tension. An important factor contributing to\r\nthese trends is the development of Russian-Chinese\r\nrelations and cooperation within the framework of friendly\r\npartnership. Mongolia welcomes the recent agreement\r\nbetween Russia and China not to target each other with\r\nstrategic nuclear missiles; we see this as a development\r\nthat augurs well for stability and confidence-building in\r\nthe region and beyond. The maintenance of good-\r\nneighbourly relations with these two countries is of\r\nparamount importance to Mongolia, and today these\r\nrelations are based on new Treaties on friendly relations\r\nand cooperation.\r\nAs opposed to the headway made in resolving and\r\npreventing crisis situations in Asia, there seems to be no\r\ndiscernible shift for the better on the Korean Peninsula.\r\nWe hope that the new leadership of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the other parties\r\nconcerned, bearing in mind the international dimensions\r\nof the problem, will display great responsibility in\r\naddressing the problems at hand.\r\nThe agreement between the Government of\r\nTajikistan and the opposition group on a temporary cease-\r\nfire constitutes a first, important step towards national\r\nreconciliation in Tajikistan, and should be built upon.\r\nLast year’s truly historic developments in the Middle\r\nEast paved the way for the positive steps that we are\r\nwitnessing today in the efforts to bring peace to the\r\nregion, inching towards a comprehensive settlement of the\r\nMiddle East conflict.\r\nWe hope that the United States-Cuba bilateral\r\nagreement on the immigration question will prove to have\r\na far-reaching impact on resolving the outstanding issues\r\nbetween these two countries.\r\nWe commend the peaceful manner in which the goal\r\nof restoring democracy in Haiti was achieved.\r\nThe wars that continue to rage in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and in Afghanistan and the tragedies in\r\nRwanda and Somalia testify to the highly complex nature\r\nof these problems and remind us again that the efforts of\r\nthe international community to resolve them should by no\r\nmeans decrease in intensity.\r\nBold steps are needed, particularly by the nuclear-\r\nweapon States, to solve the mutually interlinked problems\r\nof the indefinite extension of the non-proliferation Treaty\r\nand the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty in\r\n1995, as well as credible security assurances for the non-\r\nnuclear-weapon States.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the five nuclear-weapon\r\nStates supported Mongolia’s declaration of its territory as\r\na nuclear-weapon-free zone and expressed their intention to\r\nrespect that status. The Non-Aligned Movement has also\r\nwelcomed that initiative as a commendable contribution to\r\nregional stability and confidence-building. In an effort to\r\ncontribute to the establishment of an effective verification\r\nsystem for the future comprehensive test-ban treaty,\r\nMongolia has expressed its interest in being part of the\r\nglobal seismic monitoring network. We stand ready to\r\ncooperate on this question with the interested parties.\r\nThe unchecked arms trade and its increase to global\r\nproportions, and especially its extension into volatile and\r\nunstable regions of the world, is fraught with dangerous\r\nconsequences. We believe that it is high time for the\r\nUnited Nations to take a close and comprehensive look at\r\nthe issue with a view to formulating the legal parameters of\r\nthe conduct of States in this respect.\r\nIn recent years the role and influence of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement in world politics have grown.\r\nConsiderable progress has been achieved in implementing\r\nthe Jakarta Final Document, which epitomized the new\r\nstrategy of the Movement in the post-cold-war era. The\r\nCairo Ministerial Conference, held last June, contributed to\r\nthe enhancement of the Movement’s activities. Here, I\r\nshould also like to mention that this Conference emphasized\r\nthe need to augment the Movement’s efforts with a view to\r\nadequately responding to common problems facing the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nI wish to make a few more comments on the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn the wake of the cold-war policy that limited the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to implement fully the\r\npurposes and principles of its Charter, new opportunities\r\nhave opened up before the world Organization. All at once,\r\nthe eyes of the world, full of hope and expectation, have\r\nturned to the United Nations. The United Nations has\r\nexerted a great deal of effort, and it can be credited with\r\nimpressive accomplishments, especially in the areas of\r\npeace-keeping and humanitarian assistance. Nevertheless,\r\nmany Member States have voiced their concern over and\r\ncriticism of the restructuring of the United Nations and\r\nhave stressed the need to ensure a proper balance in its\r\nactivities.\r\nWe can well understand the justified criticism that our\r\nOrganization is disproportionately preoccupied with peace-\r\nkeeping and security issues at the expense of its urgent\r\ndevelopment agenda. We expect that with deliberations\r\non and the subsequent adoption of the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment there will be less grounds for such criticism.\r\nThe composition of the Security Council and its\r\nmethods of work do not reflect the realities of the time.\r\nMy delegation hopes that the ongoing deliberations in the\r\nWorking Group on this issue will be intensified and\r\nsuccessfully concluded by the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe commend and support the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his efforts to enhance the\r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the Secretariat. We are\r\nconfident that the Secretary-General will persevere in his\r\nreform process, and wish him every success in his future\r\nendeavours.\r\nThe Mongolian people is approaching an auspicious\r\nevent, which will be observed this coming November —\r\nnamely, the seventieth anniversary of the proclamation of\r\nthe Republic, which represents an important juncture in\r\nrestoring our independence. My people has accomplished\r\nsince then an arduous journey marked by ups and downs.\r\nToday we are continuing our reforms in line with our\r\ndemocratic Constitution of 1992.\r\nIn keeping with its foreign policy concept, Mongolia\r\nwill continue to endeavour to make its own contribution\r\nto the common cause of developing friendly relations and\r\ncooperation between nations and ensuring peace, security\r\nand progress.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nnext speaker is the Deputy Prime Minister, Attorney\r\nGeneral and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas,\r\nHis Excellency the Honourable Orville Turnquest. I now\r\ncall on him.\r\nMr. Turnquest (Bahamas): I wish to join other\r\nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. Your experience in international affairs, as well\r\nas your proven diplomatic skills, provide the assurance of\r\na successful conclusion of our deliberations.\r\nAt the same time, I wish to express our gratitude\r\nand sincere appreciation to His Excellency Ambassador\r\nSamuel Rudolph Insanally, for the distinguished manner\r\nin which he presided over this historic Assembly during\r\na particularly challenging forty-eighth session, ably\r\nrepresenting not only his country, Guyana, but the entire\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nLatin American and Caribbean region. We commend him\r\nfor his performance.\r\nOur Secretary-General continues his outstanding\r\nstewardship of the United Nations during these critical\r\ntimes, when this world body is increasingly being called\r\nupon to respond to crises of staggering dimensions. The\r\nBahamas appreciates his tireless efforts.\r\nAnniversaries are times of celebration and times of\r\nreflection. As this world assembly approaches its fiftieth\r\nbirthday, it is wholly appropriate that we should seek to\r\nevaluate our record.\r\nI believe that we can all agree that in our efforts to\r\nguide international relations in the 50 years since the end of\r\nthe Second World War, there have been both successes and\r\nfailures. We must surely build on the successes and\r\nredirect our energies to effectively reduce the number of\r\nfailures.\r\nThe credible success of this world Organization and its\r\nspecialized agencies in measurably improving the health,\r\nliteracy and education standards of the world’s poor is no\r\nmean achievement. So also has been the success of this\r\nbody in seeking to ensure the environmental integrity of the\r\nplanet, in galvanizing the resources of the world to fight the\r\nillicit drug traffic, and in peacefully resolving disputes.\r\nWe can all be justly satisfied that the persistence of\r\nthis Assembly played a pivotal role in bringing to an end\r\nthe racist Government in South Africa. The victory of non-\r\nracial democracy in that torn land must give us hope even\r\nin the face of the most intractable problems. The Bahamas\r\njoins other Members in welcoming South Africa back into\r\nthe fold of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Bahamas fully supports the noble cause of the\r\nGovernment of South Africa as it begins the task of\r\nreconciliation and reconstruction. President Nelson\r\nMandela and the people of South Africa can be fully\r\nassured of my Government’s hand of friendship.\r\nVictory in South Africa allowed us to dare to hope for\r\nan opening in Haiti. This Assembly knows very well the\r\nlong history of abuse of that poor Caribbean nation — a\r\nland in which the apartheid of wealth has flourished in a\r\ndestitute country. For many generations now, Haitian\r\nnationals have felt compelled to abandon their homes,\r\nfrequently in unseaworthy boats, in search of personal\r\ndignity and of economic and political liberty.\r\nMy country has frequently been their first safe\r\nharbour, and, while proud of our record of assistance, we\r\nhave been and remain ill-equipped to offer such refuge.\r\nMembers are aware of the tremendous burden that my\r\ncountry has had to bear in this regard. This refuge has\r\nbeen provided by the Bahamas in spite of the absence of\r\neither recognition or assistance from the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nTo say that our education, health and welfare\r\nresources have been stretched beyond capacity in our\r\nsmall island developing country is to greatly understate\r\nthe situation. When we add the extra costs attributable to\r\nthe necessary marine patrols associated with the\r\nmonitoring of undocumented persons, the full burden\r\ncreated in the Bahamas by Haitian nationals fleeing their\r\nhomes begins to become apparent.\r\nHence, the recognition by this body of the absolute\r\nnecessity for the world community to forcibly respond to\r\nthe brutality of the military dictatorship in Haiti is very\r\nmuch appreciated. The support given to the early\r\ninitiative led by the Caribbean Community to force a\r\nresolution of the crisis in Haiti has already borne fruit,\r\nand we commend the United States of America for its\r\nleadership in this important initiative.\r\nWe therefore join in welcoming the formation of the\r\nmultinational force authorized by the Security Council to\r\ntake all necessary action to restore the democratically\r\nelected government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\r\nNotwithstanding the tremendous costs that in recent years\r\nhave accrued to the Bahamas as a result of developments\r\nin Haiti, we have also agreed to lend manpower support\r\nto that force.\r\nToday’s announcement that the coup leaders have\r\nresigned and will be leaving the country now paves the\r\nway for the desired return of President Jean-Bertrand\r\nAristide later this week.\r\nIt is especially important that the international\r\ncommunity now dedicate sufficient funding and expertise\r\nto the economic reconstruction of Haiti to achieve\r\ndemocracy in that land. It must continue to do so even\r\ntoday as Haitians await the announced departure of the\r\nfeared military from leadership and the return of their\r\nelected President. We who promote and encourage the\r\nadoption of democratic forms of government must also\r\naccept a degree of responsibility to service that\r\ndemocracy, especially in its infancy. The infant\r\ndemocracy that is struggling to be born in Haiti will\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nsurely die unless it receives the succour and support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nSince the Second World War, the world community\r\nhas addressed the plight of political refugees. The\r\nincreased demand to assist persons fleeing political\r\npersecution is demonstrated in the ethnic purges and\r\nwarfare in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe dramatic exodus, during the first half of this year,\r\nof hundreds of thousands of persons across the seas on\r\nunseaworthy craft or down long roads across borders\r\ndramatically brought to the attention of the world\r\ncommunity the plight of undocumented persons seeking\r\nshelter outside of their homelands.\r\nThe burden borne by the Bahamas as a result of the\r\npresence of large numbers of undocumented Haitians is\r\nnow compounded by the more recent arrival of hundreds of\r\nCubans seeking to enter the United States of America. The\r\nBahamas Government is encouraged by recent efforts by\r\nboth the United States of America and the Republic of\r\nCuba to address this perennial problem of Cuban migrants.\r\nThe gravity of the Haitian crisis, the inhumanity of the\r\ngenocide in Bosnia, the cruelty of the murders in Rwanda\r\nand the ongoing war in Angola all are clarion calls to our\r\nOrganization and to the world that we must desist from\r\ntardy, piecemeal approaches and address in a timely and\r\ncomprehensive manner not only the effects but the very\r\nroot causes of these situations.\r\nNot least among these is economics, evidenced by a\r\ncrisis in development. Despair at the hopeless socio-\r\neconomic conditions of one’s daily life has given rise, in\r\nthose so affected, to a basic pessimism and to the\r\nwillingness to risk even one’s life for changed\r\ncircumstances. Where basic needs are unmet and survival\r\nis in jeopardy, there is little stake in the future and little\r\nreason to consider the sustainability of one’s actions. The\r\nreal threat to our future security is therefore no longer\r\nmilitary aggression but deteriorating economic conditions.\r\nThe alleviation of widespread poverty while managing finite\r\nresources in the face of spiralling population growth will be\r\namong the major challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Bahamas, therefore, looks forward to the\r\nSecretary-General’s revised “Agenda for Development”,\r\nhopeful that it will serve as an effective guideline for the\r\ncreation and implementation of measures commensurate\r\nwith the legitimate aspirations of Member States. We must\r\nnot lose ground in this session by becoming submerged in\r\nattempts to redefine development. We must, rather, focus\r\non the different levels of development that exist in our\r\nseveral countries. We must learn their effects and find\r\nsolutions for narrowing obvious disparities. These\r\nsolutions must include programmes specially suited to the\r\ndiffering levels of development of Member States.\r\nWe must therefore ensure that our quest for\r\nsustainable development is people-centred. We must\r\nconsider sustainable human development with a focus on\r\njustice, equality and democratic freedom as well as on\r\nmaterial well-being that incorporates equal opportunity for\r\nall. Inequity engenders violence, and violence fragments\r\nsociety.\r\nThe Bahamas, in spite of its apparent growth and\r\nstrong economic indicators, is still only a developing\r\nnation. However, unlike many other developing nations,\r\nthe Bahamas is continually frustrated in its efforts to\r\nsecure international resources and concessionary financing\r\nfrom multilateral institutions because of its reputed level\r\nof per capita gross national product.\r\nAs a small archipelagic country of a mere 260,000\r\npeople scattered over 100,000 square miles, burdened by\r\nthe cost of transportation and infrastructure replication,\r\nand with a very small minority of our residents in an\r\nextremely high income bracket whilst the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the population is at the opposite end of the\r\neconomic scale, we are advocating that this grossly\r\nmisleading per capita criterion for gross national product\r\nshould not be the only basis upon which resources and\r\nassistance are allocated to developing countries, such as\r\nthe Bahamas.\r\nIt is the view of the Bahamas that the entire system\r\nfor determining eligibility for development assistance\r\nshould be comprehensively reviewed, as it is clear that\r\nspecial consideration ought to be given to countries like\r\nthe Bahamas, with peculiar imbalances and vulnerabilities.\r\nFor its part, the Bahamas is engaged in a process of\r\nrefining its development indicators in an attempt to ensure\r\nthat data provided to international institutions are truly\r\nreflective of our economic-development reality. We\r\nexpect that the data so provided will also have an impact\r\nupon our budgetary assessments.\r\nThis comprehensive review, we believe, must\r\ninclude consideration of the vulnerability index identified\r\nin the Programme of Action of the Global Conference on\r\nSmall Island Developing States as the direction to be\r\nfollowed in the development of a measurement of the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\necological fragility and economic vulnerability of small\r\nisland developing States.\r\nIn this connection, I would remind the Assembly of an\r\nimportant message which was reinforced by the recent\r\nConference on Small Island Developing States, that is, that\r\nunless the peculiar difficulties of these States are properly\r\naddressed, those States will not have the wherewithal to\r\nproceed on a path to sustainable development.\r\nThe marine environment presents both an opportunity\r\nand a constraint with respect to the sustainable development\r\nand security of any island State. As a maritime nation, the\r\nBahamas attaches tremendous importance to the\r\nConvention, which has resulted in the creation of a new\r\nlegal regime for the oceans. Among its new achievements\r\nare the recognition of the legal status of archipelagos, the\r\n12-mile territorial sea, transit passage, the exclusive\r\neconomic zone, and the protection and preservation of the\r\nmarine environment and the resources of the deep seabed\r\nas the common-heritage of mankind.\r\nThe Bahamas was particularly pleased to join with\r\nother Member States in signing the agreement on seabed\r\nmining in July of this year, as that agreement modifies\r\nprovisions that had prevented many States from becoming\r\nparties to the Convention. The long awaited entry into\r\nforce of the Convention is therefore of extreme importance,\r\nas it provides a boost to our efforts to curb infringement on\r\nboth our national security and our national resources.\r\nWhile the socio-economic health of the world still\r\npresents challenges for the Organization, we have scored\r\nsome political successes in the recent past. These successes\r\ninclude, of course, the peace accord between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization signed in September of\r\nlast year, which led to self-rule in the Gaza Strip and\r\nJericho for the Palestinian people, and the signing of the\r\nWashington Declaration between Israel and Jordan last July.\r\nWe also applaud and encourage the dialogue now under\r\nway between Israel and Syria.\r\nIn spite of those successes, peace-keeping still\r\noccupies an important place in our activities. However, we\r\nmust ensure that peace-keeping operations are not\r\nconducted at the expense of other activities which are\r\nequally important, such as the development programmes of\r\nthe United Nations. After all, development is a prerequisite\r\nfor peace.\r\nFor small countries with limited resources, such as the\r\nBahamas, a major justification for membership in\r\ninternational organizations is the enhancement of national\r\ncapacity. It is therefore the duty of the United Nations to\r\nfacilitate the efforts of small countries to arrive at just and\r\nequitably sound solutions to differences within the\r\ninternational society of States, especially when they\r\ninvolve political and economic giants.\r\nIt is from this perspective that the Bahamas supports\r\nthe efforts of the Republic of China to entreat the\r\nOrganization to examine the merits of establishing an ad\r\nhoc committee to analyse comprehensively the current\r\nimplications and future ramifications of the preclusion of\r\nthe 21 million people in the Republic of China from\r\ncontributing to, and availing themselves of, all the\r\nbenefits deriving from membership in the United Nations\r\nand its affiliated agencies. Our Organization is expected\r\nto reflect universality and to demonstrate impartiality\r\nwhen forging international agreements for policy\r\ncommitments, for accessing resources and for action.\r\nThe Bahamas welcomes the report of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the question of more equitable\r\nrepresentation within the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. The Group’s work thus far has been positive\r\nand constructive, and we trust that the momentum of its\r\ndiscussions will be maintained.\r\nThe report on the Security Council is of importance\r\nto all Member States. As its conclusions affect each\r\nMember quite directly, it is essential that the Council\r\nshould be seen to reflect as accurately as possible the\r\nwishes of the entire international community.\r\nAccordingly, it is imperative that the composition of a\r\nnew Security Council properly reflect regional diversity\r\nand thereby enhance the legitimacy of the actions of that\r\nimportant United Nations body.\r\nWe in the Bahamas look with great expectation to\r\nthe observance of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. The preparatory period for this event is an ideal\r\ntime for reflection on targets and objectives which have\r\nalready been set by our Organization, some of which have\r\nnow been outstanding for many years. Turning fifty is an\r\nopportunity for the Organization to regain the confidence\r\nof our peoples. It will take hard work and determination\r\nto achieve the desired results so that over the next 50\r\nyears the United Nations will be known in all societies\r\nand across all levels of those societies as the real leader\r\nin the fight to bring dignity to mankind.\r\nIn the words of the great Johann Wolfgang von\r\nGoethe:\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\n“We must not hope to be mowers\r\nAnd to gather the ripe gold ears\r\nUnless we have first been sowers\r\nAnd watered the furrows with tears.\r\n“It is not just as we take it,\r\nThis mystical world of ours;\r\nLife’s field will yield as we make it:\r\nA harvest of thorns or of flowers.”\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chad,\r\nMr. Ahmat Abderaman Haggar.\r\nMr. Haggar (Chad) (interpretation from French):\r\nAllow me, Sir, to convey to you on behalf of the people\r\nand Government of Chad, our heartfelt congratulations on\r\nyour unanimous election to preside over the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. It was a resounding\r\ntribute to your country, whose devotion to peace and\r\ndialogue is well known. Not simply Côte d’Ivoire, but the\r\nwhole of Africa has thus been honoured.\r\nWe should like to take this opportunity to salute the\r\nmemory of the late President Félix Houphouët-Boigny,\r\nwhose renown as a statesman extended beyond our\r\ncontinent.\r\nI should also like to convey heartfelt thanks to your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Samuel Rudolph Insanally of\r\nGuyana, for the skill with which he conducted the business\r\nof our previous session.\r\nFinally, I wish to express our profound gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\ndedication to international peace and security, to which he\r\nhas contributed with “An Agenda for Peace”, now\r\nsupplemented by “An Agenda for Development”.\r\nWe welcome the return to this Hall of South Africa,\r\na South Africa now free of apartheid. We welcome it and\r\nwish every success to President Nelson Mandela, whose\r\ntenacity should once again be commended.\r\nThe picture of the international situation following the\r\nend of the cold war is mixed, being one of both hope and\r\nuncertainty.\r\nThe evolving peace process in the Middle East is an\r\nimportant step towards the achievement of a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting settlement of a crisis which\r\nhas persisted for too long. We pay warm tribute to the\r\nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders who, with their\r\nforesightedness and sense of history, have taken this\r\ndecisive step. We venture to hope that the peoples of this\r\nregion, sorely in need of peace, have the benefit of the\r\nwholehearted support of the international community.\r\nWe also commend the efforts now going on to\r\nrestore democracy to Haiti.\r\nChad has also been following with interest the\r\nprocess under way in Mozambique, and we hope that the\r\nelections to be held on 27 and 28 October will pave the\r\nway to a new era of peace and prosperity.\r\nHowever, grim situations still continue. How can\r\none fail to be outraged at the daily events occurring in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Liberia, Afghanistan or\r\nSomalia? Chad, which has been through three decades of\r\nconflict, sympathizes with the tragic experience of the\r\npeoples of these countries and condemns practices based\r\non ethnic, racial and religious criteria, practices which\r\nbelong to the past.\r\nThis was one of the reasons which prompted my\r\nGovernment to make a modest contribution, first, by its\r\nmilitary presence with the French force in Opération\r\nTurquoise, and then in the second United Nations\r\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda.\r\nChad urges the United Nations to continue its\r\ntireless, energetic peacemaking and peace-keeping efforts\r\nand asks the parties involved in any conflict to attach\r\ngreater importance to dialogue.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome developments in the\r\nongoing talks to bring lasting peace to Angola.\r\nWe appeal for a speedy solution to the question of\r\nthe embargo afflicting the Libyan people, a solution in\r\nkeeping with resolutions of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference.\r\nThe proliferation of armed conflicts in Africa is a\r\ngreat challenge to us. Chad therefore makes an urgent\r\nappeal to the international community to give its\r\nwholehearted support to the OAU’s machinery for\r\nconflict-prevention, conflict-management and the\r\nsettlement of conflicts.\r\nConflicts of any kind are always a disaster for the\r\nhuman race. Therefore, in order to save present and\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nfuture generations from the danger of a nuclear holocaust,\r\nmy country supports the indefinite extension of the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nConventional weapons are a permanent source of\r\nconcern for Chad. That is why we support resolution 48/75\r\nE and welcome the initiative by President Alpha Omar\r\nKonare of Mali to halt the proliferation of such weapons in\r\nour region.\r\nEconomic development is a constant concern of the\r\ninternational community. That is why the various\r\ninitiatives and discussions on the subject, as well as the apt\r\nanalysis in the Agenda for Development, deserve careful\r\nconsideration at this session. The worsening economic\r\ncrisis, marked by chronic indebtedness and the drop in the\r\nprice of raw materials in developing countries in general,\r\nand in Africa in particular, has torn at the weak social\r\nfabric and threatened the stability of States. This explains\r\nthe spread of phenomena such as juvenile delinquency,\r\nwidespread drug-trafficking and organized crime.\r\nHowever, we look forward to the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development to be held in Copenhagen next year,\r\nand to the World Conference on Women, to be held in\r\nBeijing, also next year.\r\nThey will give the international community an\r\nopportunity to discuss today’s challenges and to try to\r\nimprove the lives of millions of human beings.\r\nI now turn to Chad, where the democratic process\r\nwhich began with the coming to power of the Patriotic\r\nSalvation Movement is continuing, to the satisfaction of all,\r\nthanks to the wisdom of our President, His Excellency\r\nColonel Idriss Déby, who has honoured the spirit and the\r\nletter of the historic declaration of 4 December 1990 to\r\nestablish a State of law.\r\nThe Sovereign National Conference organized, in a\r\nspirit of transparency, with the participation of citizens of\r\nChad of all strata and all political leanings in the presence\r\nof foreign observers, adopted a consistent, comprehensive\r\nstrategy. It thus reflected the general consensus on\r\nresolving all our problems, and in particular the creation of\r\na State that respects the rule of law. To that end, a\r\nschedule was worked out and transitional institutions were\r\nestablished.\r\nAt the last session, my delegation took note of\r\nprogress made towards democratization. I am happy to say\r\nfrom this rostrum that the transition in Chad is proceeding\r\nnormally thanks to cooperation between the three organs,\r\nthe presidency, the primature and the Higher Transitional\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn order to keep within our deadlines, the framework\r\nagreement was reduced to more realistic proportions,\r\nbacked up inter alia by the following priorities: the\r\nelaboration of a constitution and texts to govern the\r\nupcoming elections; the establishment of a national\r\nreconciliation committee consisting of governmental\r\nrepresentatives, representatives of the provisional\r\nparliament, political parties and civilians. That committee\r\nhas already achieved some results by signing certain\r\nagreements with some organizations, in particular the\r\nBangui II Agreement. We express gratitude to His\r\nExcellency Ange Félix Patassé, President of the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, for the decisive role he has played\r\nthroughout the negotiations. At the same time the\r\nnational reconciliation committee is continuing its\r\ncontacts with other political and military groups. Our\r\nGovernment is confident that definitive peace will be\r\nrestored to our country.\r\nConsiderable progress has been made in the\r\nrestructuring of the national army but much remains to be\r\ndone because of the complexity of the problem of\r\ndemobilizing elements and reintegrating them into civilian\r\nlife. We reiterate once more our appeal to the\r\ninternational community to provide assistance in carrying\r\nout this essential programme for lasting peace in Chad.\r\nThe signing of a social covenant concluded between\r\nthe Government and the trade unions took place on 1 July\r\n1994. It restored social peace and is the reason for the\r\nimportant progress that has been made in applying the\r\nprovisions of the framework agreement.\r\nEqually important progress has also been made in\r\nother areas. I wish to speak now of human rights and\r\nfreedoms. For almost four years now we have seen the\r\nunprecedented establishment of several independent\r\nnewspapers, the formation of many political parties, 49 of\r\nwhich have been legalized, and the creation of unions and\r\nhuman rights associations.\r\nThe recent establishment of the Supreme Council for\r\nCommunications is another guarantee of freedom of\r\nexpression, opinion and information.\r\nI turn now to human rights. My country, which has\r\nexperienced one of the most cruel and misguided\r\ndictatorships, attaches great importance to the promotion\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nand defence of these rights. The ratification of various\r\ninternational instruments and, more recently, the Convention\r\nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\r\nTreatment or Punishment, the establishment of the National\r\nCommission for Human Rights and the authorization\r\nprovided by my Government for the visit to Chad of an\r\nindependent expert from the United Nations Commission on\r\nHuman Rights, attest to this will.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Chad is therefore\r\nsurprised that certain press organs, certain human rights\r\nassociations and organizations, manipulated by those who\r\nare fighting for power, have launched a campaign that is\r\nseeking to mislead international opinion by spreading false\r\ninformation about Chad.\r\nI wish to draw attention to the special situation in my\r\ncountry, where there are many political and military groups\r\nequipped with weapons, as a consequence of the long\r\nconflict. The abuses committed by uncontrolled groups\r\ncannot and should not be attributed to Government policy\r\nto violate human rights. I should like, therefore, to take\r\nthis opportunity to call on all countries and governmental\r\nand non-governmental organizations that are interested in\r\nChad and in the future of its people to come to my country\r\nto establish the facts.\r\nFree democratic elections will be organized at the\r\nbeginning of next year in keeping with the timetable\r\nestablished by the framework agreement. On 7 October\r\n1994 His Excellency Colonel Idriss Déby, Head of State,\r\nonce again reaffirmed his determination to respect the\r\ntimetable for the elections to give the country reliable\r\ndemocratic institutions, inter alia, to guarantee the rights of\r\nall citizens. Accordingly, we ask our traditional partners to\r\nassist the Government of Chad to conclude this delicate\r\nmission which require many resources.\r\nI now turn to the question of the border dispute that\r\nexisted between my country and the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya. On 3 February 1994 the International Court of\r\nJustice in its Judgment put an end to this 20-year-old\r\nconflict. An Agreement on the practical modalities for the\r\nimplementation of that Judgment was signed on 4 April\r\n1994 in Surt. In keeping with the Agreement the\r\nwithdrawal of Libyan troops from the Aouzou Strip was\r\ncarried out according to an agreed timetable and under the\r\nsupervision of United Nations observers. Now all that\r\nremains to be done is to make a reality of the border as\r\ndefined between the two countries.\r\nI wish to reiterate my sincere thanks to all those who\r\nhave contributed directly or indirectly to the peaceful\r\nsolution of this dispute and our gratitude to the United\r\nNations. This fortunate outcome, which reflects the pre-\r\neminence of negotiation over confrontation, is a reason\r\nfor hope in the matter of prevention and resolution of\r\nconflicts.\r\nIn the framework of the rehabilitation of the Aouzou\r\nStrip and the reintegration of the local population, Chad\r\nhas already set up a technical committee to study the\r\nvarious aspects of rehabilitation, particularly the\r\nrestoration of infrastructure, the cultivation of our oases,\r\nand the restoration of our education and public health\r\nsystems. We should also create an environment\r\nconducive to all these actions by carrying out mine\r\nclearance and disinfecting wells that were poisoned during\r\nthe occupation. We appeal to the entire international\r\ncommunity to help us to carry out this programme.\r\nChad, like many other countries in Africa, is\r\nconfronting an unprecedented economic and financial\r\ncrisis. Existing difficulties have been compounded by the\r\ndevaluation of the CFA franc, which has wiped out all the\r\nefforts by the Government within the structural\r\nadjustment framework. My country regrets the fact that\r\nthe steps to accompany the devaluation have not been\r\nentirely honoured. We urge some of our partners to\r\ncomply with their commitments in this respect.\r\nChad is a country which is half desert and has\r\nsuffered a rapid degradation of its environment because of\r\nits lack of energy resources and we welcome, therefore,\r\nthe signing on 17 June 1994 in Paris of the International\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in those Countries\r\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\r\nParticularly in Africa. We hope that the provisions of the\r\nConvention will not remain a dead letter.\r\nWhile in the Sahel rain is welcomed enthusiastically,\r\nthe rainfall, which has been particularly abundant this\r\nyear, has caused flooding in many regions of my country,\r\ncausing serious damage to crops and leaving many\r\nfamilies homeless. At the same time an epidemic of\r\ncholera has broken out in some cities in Chad.\r\nWe are working together with our various partners,\r\nUnited Nations agencies and non-governmental\r\norganizations to deal with these situations following\r\nappeals made respectively by the Ministers of Agriculture\r\nand Health.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nThe United Nations will celebrate its fiftieth\r\nanniversary next year. To meet the many challenges we\r\nmust adapt to present changes. Therefore my country\r\nsupports the common African position on restructuring and\r\nthe revitalization of the United Nations in the economic,\r\nsocial and related fields.\r\nI turn now to the Security Council. I wish to recall\r\nthat the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nChad stated from this rostrum on 8 October 1976 that\r\n“The Security Council, whose principal role is to\r\nsafeguard international peace and security, should\r\nreflect the geographical composition of the\r\ninternational community.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Thirty-first Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 23rd meeting, para. 22)\r\nIn the light of ongoing discussion of this question, we\r\nreiterate this position because it is a requirement of our\r\ntime.\r\nI cannot conclude my statement without saying that we\r\nhope that the work of the present session will yield answers\r\nto our legitimate concerns.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Equatorial Guinea, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Oyono Ndong Mifumu (Equatorial Guinea)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): I would be disloyal to the\r\nfeelings of the delegation of the Republic of Equatorial\r\nGuinea if I did not from the outset join with the preceding\r\nspeakers in expressing my best wishes to you and\r\ncongratulating you on your well-deserved election to the\r\nPresidency of this General Assembly. I wish you every\r\nsuccess and assure you of the complete cooperation of my\r\ndelegation. Please convey my congratulations also to the\r\nother members of the General Committee, whose work is\r\nnot always given due recognition.\r\nWe also commend the work accomplished by\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who presided\r\nover the last session of the General Assembly. And I wish\r\nto express special appreciation to His Excellency\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our distinguished Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for his deep commitment to the search for viable\r\nsolutions to the problems and difficulties confronting\r\nmankind today.\r\nThis forty-ninth session of the General Assembly is\r\nbeing held at a time when the international community is\r\nexpressing its concern at the bleak panorama that the\r\nworld offers us, and more than ever is proclaiming its\r\nright to preserve peace and the socio-political and\r\neconomic stability of the world. This session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, therefore, must not disappoint these\r\npressing aspirations of the human community, which has\r\nevery reason to continue to consider the United Nations\r\nas the hope of mankind.\r\nIt is illogical and inconceivable to the peoples of our\r\nworld that after the fall of the ideological borders that\r\nshaped the bipolar world, we should again be confronted\r\nwith new burdens and contradictions. My country is\r\ndeeply concerned at the negative effect of the wave of\r\nviolence in many parts of the world today. In record\r\ntime, we have seen evidence of many sources of tension\r\nand conflicts that wipe out many years of United Nations\r\nefforts. Everywhere panic and uncertainty prevail, owing\r\nto the intolerance and arbitrariness that are real threats to\r\nworld peace. None the less, it would seem that we all\r\nwant to close our eyes and act as though we did not know\r\nthe causes of this instability. For the Republic of\r\nEquatorial Guinea, the causes are all interdependent:\r\npoverty, inequality in relations among nations,\r\nunemployment, ignorance, and political and religious\r\nintolerance.\r\nThis forty-ninth session of our General Assembly\r\nmust therefore reflect deeply in order to find a global\r\nsolution to these common denominators of all our\r\ncountries. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea wishes to\r\nreaffirm here, from this rostrum, the confidence that it has\r\nplaced in the United Nations and our conviction that this\r\nOrganization is the ideal framework for resolving the\r\ndifficult, delicate and complex problems confronting the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn this grim international panorama, my country, the\r\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea, is endeavouring to\r\npreserve internal peace and political stability, and to\r\nmaintain a strict policy of good-neighbourliness and\r\ncooperation with the other countries of central Africa. In\r\nthis framework, we have been strengthening the internal\r\nsocio-political structures that make it possible to\r\ncoordinate an integral, democratic system that guarantees\r\nthe individual and collective freedoms of our citizens.\r\nIndeed in 1991, the Government began a transition on the\r\nbasis of established constitutional provisions and has been\r\nestablishing the political environment conducive to\r\npolitical pluralism and a multiparty system. A number of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nlegal regulations now govern the exercise of pluralist\r\ndemocracy in my country. May I mention, among them:\r\nthe law of political parties, the law of freedom of\r\nassociation and expression, our trade union law, the law of\r\nfreedom of the press and printed matter, the law of\r\nfreedom of religion, the law of complaints and petitions,\r\nand all the other laws that govern the electoral process.\r\nTherefore, the fact is that Equatorial Guinea today is\r\na free, democratic and independent country where peace\r\nand stability prevail. With only 400,000 inhabitants, we\r\nhave 14 political organizations that operate freely and\r\ndemocratically and constitute the pluralist expression of our\r\npeoples. None the less, as everyone knows, there are some\r\nwho, because of their concealed interests, have attempted,\r\nand continue to attempt, to thwart the will of some of our\r\npolitical leaders in our democratic process. This is the root\r\ncause of the disinformation campaign that is being waged\r\nagainst my country.\r\nAllow me to dwell a moment on this point. Because\r\nmy country is being subjected to a systematic international\r\ncampaign of disinformation through certain very well-\r\nlocalized media. Hence a negative image is being projected\r\nof my country, in total disregard of the efforts that have\r\nbeen made since 1979 by His Excellency Mr. Obiang\r\nNguema Mbasogo, the President of the Republic of\r\nEquatorial Guinea, to restore the respectability and honour\r\nof my country after 11 long, bloody years of the\r\ndictatorship of Macias Nguema, who was overthrown\r\nwithout anyone helping us. Regarding this campaign of\r\ndisinformation, there is a saying that I would like to\r\nreiterate here: “The truth is one, but untruth is manifold”.\r\nEverything depends on the colour of the lens through which\r\none looks. There are some who, because of their own\r\nunconfessed interests prefer to continue to look at us\r\nthrough a dark lens; but we ask the international community\r\nto assess our actions in a neutral and objective way, without\r\nallowing itself to be influenced by third parties. We ask\r\nthat you view us through a clear lens that will allow you to\r\nsee the reality.\r\nPlease do not misunderstand me. We are not against\r\nthe contribution of the international community to the\r\nefforts of the people and Government of Equatorial Guinea\r\nfor democracy and the promotion of human rights and\r\nfreedoms, but we do believe that these objectives cannot be\r\nachieved by promoting and instigating ungovernability,\r\nanarchy and civil disobedience in the developing countries.\r\nWe see some countries now using the international\r\ncommunity’s demand for respect for human rights and\r\ndemocracy to mask activities that are aimed at\r\nsubjugating developing countries such as Equatorial\r\nGuinea. None the less, we would like to point out that in\r\nthe course of this year, certain donors, such as France and\r\nSpain and the United Nations Development Programme,\r\nhave made a positive contribution to our democratic\r\nprocess by giving moral, technical and economic support\r\nto our efforts to consolidate democracy. They have done\r\nexcellent work.\r\nWe believe that the escalation of domestic tensions\r\nin many African countries today has a common cause:\r\npolitical intolerance, fuelled and promoted by foreign\r\nintervention in a country\u0027s domestic jurisdiction.\r\nHowever, as the saying goes, “The master’s eye makes\r\nthe horse fat” — in other words, however they may be\r\nassessed or distorted from outside, the realities in each of\r\nthe countries in those regions exist independently of the\r\ninterpretations placed on them.\r\nWe in Equatorial Guinea believe that development\r\nand democracy can be promoted only in an atmosphere of\r\npeace. We therefore feel that the United Nations should\r\nput emphasis on its efforts at preventive action rather than\r\nthose designed to restore peace or serve as a buffer.\r\nMeasures such as the dispatch of evaluation or inquiry\r\nmissions to individual countries can be more effective in\r\navoiding conflicts like those currently taking place in such\r\nfraternal and friendly countries as Angola, Rwanda,\r\nLiberia, Somalia, the former Yugoslavia and so on.\r\nInterventions after the fact have been shown to have\r\nlimited effectiveness.\r\nSome peace-keeping missions and operations in\r\ncertain conflict areas have also undergone a qualitative\r\nchange. It is therefore urgent to redirect the mechanisms\r\nthrough which the Organization functions and adapt them\r\nto the changes in today\u0027s world.\r\nWe believe that in an increasingly complicated\r\nworld, and with limited resources, international relations\r\nmust be complementary. In this sphere the role of the\r\nUnited Nations has become even more decisive. It is\r\nhardly useful for some to attempt to monopolize the\r\nsolution to the world\u0027s problems if we do not all feel\r\nsincerely involved. As an earlier speaker in the general\r\ndebate noted, there can be neither peace nor justice if\r\ndiscrimination exists in international relations.\r\nMy country hopes that the new world scene will\r\nwitness the implementation of procedures for sincere\r\ninternational cooperation on behalf of those countries that\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nneed it most, those countries that are struggling not just to\r\nmaintain the quality of life but often for their very survival.\r\nThe poverty and misery in all the countries on Earth calls\r\nfor action by others to remedy their plight.\r\nUnited Nations efforts in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security contrast with the limited\r\nprogress achieved in economic and social development.\r\nThe global chasm separating rich and poor is steadily\r\nwidening. We need the solidarity of the industrialized\r\ncountries, on mutually agreed terms, if we developing\r\ncountries are to find a definitive solution to our external-\r\ndebt problem, the burden of which is another obstacle to\r\nprogress and greater social development.\r\nIt would be most promising if agreement could be\r\nreached on the mechanisms to solve this economic,\r\nfinancial and socio-economic problem. One such\r\nmechanism might be a re-examination of the idea of\r\nconverting external debt into investment and into projects\r\nwith proven social impact.\r\nThe preservation of the environment and the fight\r\nagainst drug trafficking are questions that demand\r\nconsideration. The 1972 Stockholm Declaration established\r\nthe foundations for some universal principles for the\r\nprotection of the global environment and efforts to control\r\npollution and combat desertification and deforestation.\r\nReality, however, called for new initiatives, which\r\nculminated in the Rio Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment. We hope that the results of that Conference\r\nwill be of benefit to all and help ensure mankind\u0027s the\r\nsustainable development and future well-being.\r\nI should, however, like to emphasize the obligation of\r\nthe developed and industrialized countries — which bear\r\nthe greatest responsibility for the deterioration of the global\r\necosystem — to those countries that today are being asked\r\nto make the sacrifice of limiting their legitimate right to the\r\nuse of the riches nature has bestowed on them. Fitting\r\ncompensation must be forthcoming, particularly through the\r\nfunding of alternative projects and technological\r\ncooperation.\r\nWithin its modest financial means, the Republic of\r\nEquatorial Guinea has been and remains ready to take\r\naction to improve its national environment as its\r\ncontribution to the task of preserving nature throughout the\r\nworld. The Government of Equatorial Guinea is also\r\ngiving its constant attention to the struggle against the\r\nAIDS pandemic, and, thanks to the deep awareness of the\r\npeople of Equatorial Guinea and the assistance we are\r\nreceiving from international agencies, we shall spare no\r\neffort to control it effectively. From this rostrum we are\r\nappealing to the international community to join us in our\r\nefforts to speed and support work in these sectors.\r\nFor all those reasons, we hope that the United\r\nNations will continue to enjoy the full support of all of us\r\nin working to achieve a better world in the coming 50\r\nyears.\r\nMr. Tshering (Bhutan): I have the honour to\r\nconvey to you, Mr. President, and, through you, to all the\r\ndelegations here present the warm greetings and good\r\nwishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King of\r\nBhutan, for the success of the forty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI should first like to congratulate you, Mr. President,\r\non your unanimous election, which is a testimony to the\r\nhigh regard that the international community has for your\r\ncountry and the confidence of this Assembly in your\r\npersonal leadership. Given your long association and\r\nintimate knowledge of the United Nations, we are sure\r\nyou will provide the necessary direction on the many\r\nimportant issues that we are about to take up during this\r\nsession.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to place on\r\nrecord our deep appreciation and gratitude to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Samuel Insanally for the excellent manner\r\nin which he conducted the proceedings of our last session.\r\nHis innovative and vigorous pursuit of discussions on the\r\nreform of the United Nations, the restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council and the hearings on development have\r\nset the stage for the current discussions.\r\nWe should like to pay a tribute to our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his distinguished\r\nleadership. We appreciate his tireless efforts to steer the\r\nUnited Nations in bold and new directions.\r\nWe had the opportunity to welcome President\r\nMandela and to hear his historic and enlightened address\r\nin this Hall. We welcome the end of apartheid and South\r\nAfrica\u0027s return to the family of nations.\r\nIn the Middle East, the transition of the Gaza Strip\r\nand Jericho to Palestinian self-government, the return of\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat and the signing of the\r\nWashington Declaration between Jordan and Israel clearly\r\ndemonstrate the increasing desire for peace in the region.\r\nWe applaud the parties for the brave decision to embark\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\non the difficult path to peace. It is our hope that all parties\r\nwill join the process towards peace and reconciliation,\r\nbased on the relevant Security Council resolutions. It is our\r\nhope that the international community will support the\r\nPalestinian people in bringing about economic development\r\nin the self-rule areas.\r\nThe situation in the Gulf warrants our close attention.\r\nThe international community must reject any threat against\r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. We urge\r\nall parties to abide by and fully implement the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nPrince Sisowath Sirirath (Cambodia), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe problems in Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nHaiti and many other parts of the world still demand the\r\ncareful and urgent attention of the United Nations. These\r\nconflicts severely test the international community\u0027s\r\ncapacity and resolve to deal with humanitarian needs and\r\nconflict resolution.\r\nWe welcome the continued reduction of nuclear\r\nweapons and the turning-away of such weapons from their\r\nprevious targets. We support the extension of the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons beyond 1995 and\r\nthe proposal for the negotiation of a comprehensive test\r\nban. We urge the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea\r\nto continue negotiations in earnest and to comply with the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency\u0027s safeguards\r\nagreement; thereby avoiding suspicion and doubt.\r\nMy delegation supports the proposal for both the\r\nreduction and the clearance of anti-personnel mines. The\r\nmanufacture of, trade in and deployment of such weapons,\r\nwhich cause indiscriminate and mindless death and\r\nmaiming, are unconscionable. We urge all parties to\r\nparticipate in the United Nations Register of Conventional\r\nArms. The scope of the exercise should be expanded to\r\ninclude not only trade but also manufacture and stockpiling.\r\nThe arms trade should cease to provide an opportunity for\r\nprofiteering on the part of any State.\r\nFor several years now we have been talking about\r\nrestructuring the United Nations. The discussions continue,\r\nbut, so far, little, if any, substantive reform has taken place.\r\nIn our humble view, reform of the United Nations must\r\nreflect the perceptions and expectations of all Members.\r\nFor many of the larger Member States, the United Nations\r\nis a forum in which to project and promote national\r\npolicies. But in the case of the developing countries — in\r\nparticular, the smaller Member States — the United\r\nNations guarantees independence and sovereignty and\r\nprovides an opportunity to participate in international\r\ndialogue. The United Nations also provides both the\r\nintellectual and the material input required for social and\r\neconomic development in many developing countries.\r\nIt is clear that the General Assembly — the only\r\nforum in which all Members of the United Nations are\r\nrepresented — must be the main focus of our attention.\r\nThe relationship between the General Assembly and other\r\nUnited Nations organs must be reviewed and put in\r\nproper perspective. The General Assembly itself must be\r\nable to appreciate and understand the work of the\r\nspecialized and other agencies of the United Nations and\r\nto provide direction. It must also organize itself in such\r\na way that it can deal more effectively with its business.\r\nRoutine and symbolic resolutions must be dealt with\r\nefficiently, allowing the Assembly to focus on new and\r\nmore important challenges.\r\nThe relationship between the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council is particularly intriguing. It is a\r\ncommon mistake to think that these two bodies function\r\nlike the legislature and the executive of a government.\r\nThis myth has been perpetuated by decades of Security\r\nCouncil paralysis and by the artificial prominence\r\nachieved by the General Assembly through the passing of\r\nineffective but symbolically important resolutions. The\r\nreality is that there is only one body of authority in the\r\nUnited Nations — the Security Council. The Council\u0027s\r\ndecisions are binding on all Members. They carry the\r\nsanction of international law. The Assembly is explicitly\r\nforbidden to interfere in the work of the Council unless\r\nrequested to do so.\r\nThe case for reform of the Security Council is\r\noverwhelming. The Council must be expanded to reflect\r\nthe new realities of international relations and to make it\r\na more representative body. It is also important that the\r\ndeeper structural flaw be redressed and the Council be\r\nmade more accountable.\r\nThe financial position of the United Nations\r\ncontinues to be a matter of concern. The sudden and\r\nquantum jump in expenditure on peace-keeping\r\noperations — now more than three times greater than\r\nexpenditure on development — is becoming difficult to\r\nsustain. There are large-scale arrears in contributions.\r\nWe do not object to peace-keeping operations, but it is\r\nclear that the finances of the United Nations must be put\r\non a sound footing. Financial expenditures reflect the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\ndirection and priorities of the United Nations, as well as the\r\ncommitment of its Members.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report entitled “An\r\nAgenda for Development”, states:\r\n“Development is a fundamental human right.\r\nDevelopment is the most secure basis for peace.”\r\n(A/48/935, para. 3)\r\nThese statements provide, in brief form, the best rationale\r\nfor recommitment to development in the post-cold-war era.\r\nLike peace, development is not a new issue before the\r\nUnited Nations; the United Nations and its agencies have\r\nbeen engaged in international development for decades.\r\nWhat is alarming today is that the gap between the\r\nstandards of living of developed and of developing\r\ncountries — the rich and the poor — is growing. The\r\nconcern arises not because the well-to-do are doing better\r\nbut because the poor are doing worse. It is no longer just\r\npoverty but the destitution of one fifth of the world\u0027s\r\npopulation that must be addressed.\r\nPoverty saps the human spirit. It replaces hope with\r\ndespair, creativity with dullness, admiration with envy, and\r\ncompassion with indifference. Poverty weakens the body,\r\nmaking it susceptible to sickness and disease. Poverty\r\nclouds the mind, making it difficult for people to\r\nunderstand the circumstances of their deprivation, and\r\ngenerating bitterness against those they perceive as the\r\ncause of their misery. What is unfortunate is that in this\r\nday and age, given the advances that mankind has made in\r\nscience and technology, commerce and industry and civil\r\nand social thought, poverty need not exist.\r\nConsiderable efforts have been made to put into proper\r\nperspective the major development issues of our time. The\r\nWorld Summit for Children, the United Nations Conference\r\non Environment and Development, the Eighth United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD\r\nVIII), the World Conference on Human Rights and the\r\nrecently concluded International Conference on Population\r\nand Development not only generated a remarkable\r\nconvergence of views but also resulted in commitments to\r\nredress global concerns in the participants\u0027 respective areas.\r\nWe have no doubt that the international community will\r\napproach the World Summit for Social Development and\r\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held in\r\n1995, with the same resolve and determination.\r\nWe have all committed ourselves to accepting the\r\nconclusions of the major conferences, including the various\r\nprogrammes of action and the prescribed targets. All\r\ncountries are working hard to translate the commitments\r\ninto action, but the resources available are insufficient for\r\neffective and lasting intervention. It is a matter of great\r\nconcern that, in fact, the resources made available for\r\ndevelopment are declining.\r\nThe future of global development clearly hinges on\r\nthe provision of additional resources — additional\r\nresources in the shape of increased official development\r\nassistance for both multilateral and bilateral programmes;\r\nadditional resources from international financial\r\ninstitutions; additional resources through direct foreign\r\ninvestment and trade; and additional resources generated\r\ninternally through the creation of financial markets and\r\nthe expansion of the revenue base.\r\nWhile there seem to be many avenues for increasing\r\nthe transfer of resources, the reality is that they have\r\nyielded little for most least-developed countries.\r\nInternational banking and investments are highly selective\r\nand, by their nature, will not be attracted to the least-\r\ndeveloped countries, many of which have a small\r\neconomy and a poor infrastructure. The creation of\r\ninternal financial markets and the expansion of revenue\r\nare hampered by the low level of savings and the limited\r\ncash flow in the economy. The capacity of the least-\r\ndeveloped countries to compete in international trade is\r\nalso limited. Clearly, without increased official\r\ndevelopment assistance many least-developed countries\r\nwill fall further behind — and their situation is already\r\nprecarious.\r\nIt is ironic that resources for international\r\ndevelopment should decline when the United Nations\r\nagencies are embarking on a major thrust for poverty\r\nalleviation and sustainable human development. We urge\r\nthe donor community to continue supporting the United\r\nNations funding agencies. Although the trend towards\r\nbilateral cooperation is understandable, the donor\r\ncommunity should draw on the advantages of working\r\nthrough the United Nations agencies, given their long\r\nexperience and commendable performance in many areas.\r\nThese agencies must regain the confidence of the donor\r\ncommunity through greater efficiency and better\r\ncoordination.\r\nCredit is an essential form of input in any major\r\ndevelopment effort. The crushing debt burden of many\r\ndeveloping countries and the manner in which future\r\ncredit requirements will have to be met must be clearly\r\ndealt with in our dialogue on development. Our\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\ndiscussions must include the role of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, which must be made to work in harmony with\r\nthe efforts of United Nations agencies.\r\nBhutan long ago accepted that development must be\r\nparticipatory and environmentally sustainable. To this end\r\nBhutan has committed itself to maintaining 60 per cent of\r\nits land mass under forest cover, including 20 per cent as\r\nnational parks. All development activities have been built\r\naround this approach. We have been fortunate to receive\r\nthe generous assistance of, among others, India,\r\nSwitzerland, Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria,\r\nNorway, Kuwait, Germany, Australia and the United\r\nKingdom. Considerable support has also been made\r\navailable from the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United\r\nNations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the\r\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),\r\nthe World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations\r\nVolunteers (UNV), the Food and Agriculture Organization\r\n(FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World\r\nBank and the Asian Bank. We have never taken the\r\ninvolvement of any of our development partners for\r\ngranted, and we take this opportunity to express the sincere\r\ngratitude of the people and the Government of Bhutan to all\r\nof them.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is a time\r\nfor celebration. There is much that the United Nations has\r\nachieved for which we should all be proud. Yet it is also\r\na time for reflection and self-assessment. The success of\r\nthe next 50 years of the United Nations will depend largely\r\non our ability to meet the challenges of global human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): Several\r\nrepresentatives wish to speak in exercise of the right of\r\nreply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to 5 minutes for the second intervention\r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Cárdenas (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): In exercise of its right of reply, my delegation\r\nwould respectfully like to offer the following clarifications\r\non a part of the statement made on 4 October by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Paraguay,\r\nMr. Luis María Ramírez Boettner, during the current\r\ngeneral debate.\r\nIn his statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Republic of Paraguay said:\r\n“Paraguay declares its deep concern at the situation\r\naffecting the Pilcomayo River, which is an\r\ninternational waterway inasmuch as its source is in\r\nBolivia and it forms the border between Argentina\r\nand Paraguay.\r\n“We are now facing a major environmental\r\nproblem since that international river springs from\r\nthe mountains and is now growing shallower in its\r\ncourse because of sedimentation build-up.\r\nMoreover, the Pilcomayo, owing to works\r\nundertaken on Argentine territory, has had some 70\r\nper cent of its volume absorbed in the territory of\r\nour neighbour. These facilities are doing a great\r\ndeal of damage to the Chaco region of Paraguay,\r\nespecially to its livestock and to the population.”\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-\r\nninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 17th Meeting,\r\np. 22)\r\nArgentina is deeply committed to a policy that deals\r\nwith the problem of the environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment at the national, regional and global levels.\r\nAs for the comments made on the Pilcomayo River,\r\nArgentina has taken part in costly projects, agreed upon\r\nbetween Argentina and Paraguay in November 1991,\r\ndesigned to mitigate the effects of the blocking of the\r\nPilcomayo River in both countries. In fulfilment of the\r\nagreements of November 1991, Argentina properly and\r\npunctually completed the projects it was supposed to\r\ncarry out in its territory, but the projects that are to be\r\ncarried out in the territory of the Republic of Paraguay\r\nare still not completed. For this reason we consider it\r\ninappropriate to attribute the responsibility for the damage\r\ndone to the Chaco region of Paraguay to the projects\r\ncarried out in Argentine territory.\r\nArgentina agrees with the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs that the solution to the problem of the Pilcomayo\r\nRiver lies in the upper basin. We therefore regard as\r\nessential the ongoing participation of the Republic of\r\nBolivia in the talks on this subject.\r\nFinally, we wish once again to say to the Republic\r\nof Paraguay — to which we are bound by strong ties of\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 10 October 1994\r\nhistorical brotherhood and by a successful economic-\r\nintegration project, the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR) — that we are committed to promoting\r\noverall sustainable development in our region through joint,\r\nmature, objective analysis.\r\nMr. Zacharakis (Greece): I do not think there is\r\nreally any need to take much of the Assembly’s time for a\r\nlengthy reply to the Albanian representative, who on\r\n7 October spoke in exercise of the right of reply to my\r\nstatement of 5 October. Quite simply, while he assumes\r\nthat he has given an answer to me, he has not, in fact,\r\nresponded to the plethora of statements, summonses,\r\nappeals and accusations of the international organizations,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and observers that I quoted\r\nin my statement.\r\nOf course, I do not know whether this is due to the\r\nfact that the Albanian Government has nothing to say or\r\nwhether it reflects, once more, its well-known mentality and\r\nattitude of defying and ignoring the democratic international\r\ncommunity. This is precisely the problem, a problem\r\nwhich, as I have already underlined, does not constitute a\r\nbilateral difference between Greece and\r\nAlbania but, rather, between the latter’s Government and\r\nthe international community, to which the Government in\r\nTirane has yet to give a factual and convincing answer\r\nwith regard to respect for fundamental human rights and\r\nthe implementation of the relevant international\r\ninstruments.\r\nIt is noteworthy in this respect that the Albanian\r\nrepresentative gave us a rather poor picture of his\r\ncountry’s present-day performance by comparing it not\r\nwith the accepted high standards of modern, democratic\r\nsocieties but, rather, with a dictatorial Stalinist regime of\r\nthe worst kind which was accepted and reigned in\r\nAlbania for more than four decades.\r\nLastly, it is one thing to avoid responding to the\r\nspecific negative assessments of international\r\norganizations and observers, while it is an entirely\r\ndifferent thing to misinform the Assembly with false and\r\ninaccurate statements, such as the assurances given by the\r\nAlbanian representative in an attempt to deny what I had\r\nsaid, and his statement that there is no report of\r\nMr. Rjeplinski concerning the trial of the five minority\r\nleaders and, further, that only one document exists on this\r\nissue, in the framework of the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), entitled “Report of\r\nthe trial monitoring in Tirane”. Well, the truth is that\r\nthere is indeed a report of Professor Rjeplinski, entitled\r\n“Report from the CSCE/Office of the Director of Human\r\nRights Trial Observation in Tirane, Albania”, dated 6\r\nSeptember, which has been circulated in the CSCE and\r\nwill also be circulated in the United Nations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.55 p.m.\r\n20\r\n"
