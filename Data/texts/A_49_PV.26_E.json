(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nTentative programme of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I should\r\nlike to draw the attention of the General Assembly to\r\ndocument A/INF/49/5/Add.1, which contains a tentative\r\nprogramme of work and schedule of plenary meetings for\r\nthe months of October and November. The addendum\r\nsupersedes document A/INF/49/5. I should like to point out\r\nthat this schedule is being issued as early as possible in\r\norder to assist delegations in planning their work. For its\r\npart, the Secretariat will endeavour to ensure that the\r\nrelevant documentation will be available to delegations\r\nahead of the discussion of any given agenda item.\r\nI should further point out that there are still a few\r\nagenda items for which no date has been indicated. I will\r\nannounce the dates for the consideration of those agenda\r\nitems in due course and sufficiently in advance. I will also\r\nkeep the Assembly informed of any additions or changes.\r\nThe list of speakers for each of the items listed in\r\ndocument A/INF/49/5/Add.1 is now open.\r\nFurther, I should like to inform representatives that the\r\nPledging Conference for Development Activities will be\r\nheld on Tuesday, 1 November, and Wednesday,\r\n2 November, in the morning. I should also like to inform\r\nmembers that the announcement of voluntary contributions\r\nto the 1995 programme of the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees will take place on Friday,\r\n11 November, in the morning.\r\nAs I mentioned to the Assembly last week, I hope to\r\nkeep as close as possible to this schedule so that the\r\nAssembly can discharge its responsibilities in an effective\r\nfashion. I therefore appeal to those representatives\r\nsubmitting draft resolutions to do so sufficiently in\r\nadvance of the dates fixed for consideration of items in\r\norder to give members adequate time to examine them.\r\nI should also like to remind representatives that\r\nadditional time is needed for those draft resolutions\r\ninvolving changes in the work programme or additional\r\nexpenditures, since these will require the preparation of a\r\nstatement of programme-budget implications by the\r\nSecretary-General. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee\r\non Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth\r\nCommittee will need adequate time to review the\r\nprogramme-budget implications of a draft resolution\r\nbefore the latter can be acted on by the Assembly.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nfirst on the Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Uganda, His Excellency\r\nMr. Paul Ssemogerere.\r\nMr. Ssemogerere (Uganda): Permit me, Sir, on\r\nbehalf of the Uganda delegation, to congratulate you most\r\nwarmly on your well-deserved unanimous election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. Your election is a recognition by our\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nOrganization of your exemplary personal qualities. It is,\r\nindeed, a great honour to your country, Côte d’Ivoire, with\r\nwhich Uganda enjoys warm fraternal relations. I am\r\nconfident that, with your skills and experience, you will be\r\nable to guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion.\r\nI wish to pledge Uganda’s full support and cooperation to\r\nyou in your endeavours.\r\nI also wish to pay special tribute to your predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana, for the\r\nable manner in which he steered the work of the forty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nOur appreciation goes to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his courageous and clear-\r\nsighted leadership of the Organization.\r\nAt the outset, let me say how warmly Uganda\r\nwelcomes the presence in our midst of a new South Africa,\r\nborn on the principles of equality, justice and democratic\r\ngovernance. I wish to pay a special tribute to His\r\nExcellency President Nelson Mandela and other leaders of\r\nthe South African liberation movements, and to\r\nMr. de Klerk, for their vision and statesmanship, which\r\nenabled the United Nations to achieve one of the key long-\r\nsought objectives of Africa.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, several\r\ndevelopments have taken place in the international arena;\r\nsome of these have offered hope and encouragement, while\r\nothers have led to frustration and despair. In many\r\ncountries, peace, the rule of law and democratic governance\r\nare being consolidated. However, in some others, such as\r\nAngola, Somalia, Liberia and Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nconflicts have caused untold suffering, loss of life and\r\ndestruction of property, and have contributed to the\r\nstaggering numbers of refugees and displaced persons, with\r\nthe attendant negative consequences.\r\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees estimates the number of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons worldwide to be over 23 million and\r\n26 million respectively. Africa is estimated to have over\r\n32 per cent and Asia over 25 per cent of the total refugees.\r\nSeven countries in Africa are among the top 10 countries of\r\norigin of refugees. Most of these refugees and displaced\r\npersons have fled as a consequence of conflicts, mainly\r\nwithin nations, but to a lesser extent between nations. This\r\nis a vivid, awesome picture for Africa in particular, and for\r\ndeveloping countries in general.\r\nUganda welcomes the increasing priority attention\r\nbeing given by the United Nations to the resolution of\r\nconflicts in Africa and elsewhere, especially the emphasis\r\ngiven by the Secretary-General in “An Agenda for Peace”\r\nto preventive diplomacy and peacemaking. We agree\r\nwith his view that security, socio-economic well-being,\r\nenvironmental sustainability and the protection of human\r\nrights are closely interdependent and interlocked in a\r\nmutually reinforcing manner. They should therefore be\r\naddressed in tandem in order to avert conflicts and their\r\nattendant negative effects, such as the outflow of political\r\nand economic refugees, capital flight and brain drain.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the OAU\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution. Such a mechanism is useful for confidence-\r\nbuilding among rival parties and can facilitate peaceful\r\nresolution of conflicts. Uganda is committed to making\r\nthe OAU Mechanism effective and usable. We urge the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community to lend\r\nit the requisite support.\r\nThe situation in Somalia remains tense and fragile\r\nwith serious negative implications for peace, national\r\nreconciliation and orderly provision of humanitarian\r\nassistance. Uganda supports the new emphasis by the\r\ninternational community on seeking a political settlement\r\nto the Somalia conflict. Uganda urges all Somali groups\r\nand factions to put behind them fear and mistrust, and to\r\nbegin to implement all commitments they undertook in\r\nthe Nairobi Declaration on National Reconciliation in\r\norder to pave the way for the implementation of the\r\nAddis Ababa Agreements, including the establishment of\r\ntransitional administrative mechanisms. We commend the\r\nUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) for\r\nfacilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and we\r\nurge continued international support to Somalia.\r\nAs regards Liberia, Uganda was encouraged by steps\r\ntaken to begin the implementation of the Cotonou\r\nAgreement, namely the establishment of the Liberia\r\nNational Transitional Government and the initiation of the\r\nprocess of disarmament and demobilization of various\r\ncombatants. However, we are disappointed by the\r\nincreasingly tense military situation on the ground, both\r\nwithin and between parties, which has brought the process\r\nof disarmament and demobilization to a virtual standstill.\r\nWe urge all parties to show seriousness to the process of\r\npeace and national reconciliation as this is vital for\r\ncontinued international support and a continued presence.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nUganda welcomes steps taken so far by the\r\nGovernment of Mozambique and RENAMO to implement\r\nthe general peace agreement. We urge the parties to remain\r\ncommitted to the peace agreement and to respect the\r\noutcome of the elections scheduled for 27 and\r\n28 October 1994. We commend the United Nations\r\nOperation in Mozambique (UNOMOZ), which has helped\r\nto engender confidence among the parties — vital for the\r\nsuccessful implementation of the peace agreement — and\r\nwe urge continued international assistance to Mozambique,\r\nespecially in the resettlement of refugees and displaced\r\npersons.\r\nThe situation in Angola remains a matter of concern\r\nto the international community despite ongoing Lusaka\r\nnegotiations between the Government of Angola and\r\nUNITA. The people of Angola continue to suffer from\r\nindiscriminate killings and destruction of property. My\r\ndelegation urges the parties concerned, especially UNITA,\r\nto demonstrate flexibility, realism, political will, tolerance\r\nand compromise, which are necessary for peace and\r\nnational reconciliation.\r\nThe civil war in southern Sudan has continued to\r\nescalate, with an enormous loss of lives, destruction of\r\nproperty and a large number of refugees and displaced\r\npersons. Uganda alone hosts an estimated 300,000\r\nSudanese refugees. We urge the parties to the conflict to\r\nset their sights on the common good and mutual\r\naccommodation in the ongoing regional efforts — in\r\nparticular, the Inter-Governmental Authority for Drought\r\nand Development (IGADD) initiative — which are aimed\r\nat finding a durable political settlement.\r\nAs regards Western Sahara, Uganda is concerned at\r\nthe slow progress towards the holding of a United Nations\r\nsupervised referendum on self-determination of the people\r\nof that territory. We appeal to the parties to overcome their\r\ndifferences and enable a just and impartial referendum to be\r\neffected.\r\nThe systematic and widespread massacres of civilians\r\nwhich took place in Rwanda were tragic and deplorable.\r\nUganda supports the setting up by the Secretary-General, on\r\n29 July 1994, of an impartial commission of experts to\r\ninvestigate violations of international humanitarian law and\r\nacts of genocide committed in Rwanda with a view to\r\nidentifying persons responsible for those violations and\r\nbringing them to justice. This should contribute to the\r\nprocess of national reconciliation. We are encouraged by\r\nthe declaration of the Government in Rwanda that it will be\r\nguided by the spirit of the Arusha Peace Agreement as a\r\nframework for peace and national reconciliation and for\r\nits support for the regional initiatives on the problem of\r\nRwandese refugees. Similarly, we also appeal for\r\nassistance to be extended to local populations in\r\nneighbouring countries that are hosting the refugees, in\r\norder to mitigate the adverse socio-economic and\r\nenvironmental effects they are facing as a result of the\r\ninflux of refugees.\r\nUganda congratulates the Governments of South\r\nAfrica and Namibia for settling, through peaceful means,\r\ntheir long-standing dispute over Walvis Bay and the\r\noffshore islands.\r\nUganda notes the flexibility shown by the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya with regard to implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 731 (1992). We hope that this\r\nwill contribute to a peaceful resolution of the problem.\r\nUganda welcomes the initiation of Palestine self-rule\r\nin the Gaza Strip and Jericho. We commend Chairman\r\nArafat and Prime Minister Rabin for their political\r\nsteadfastness, which made this possible. We encourage\r\nthem to continue working together to resolve all\r\noutstanding issues for the full implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We\r\nappeal to the international community to provide\r\nincreased assistance to Palestine which is needed for\r\nreconstruction and development.\r\nWe express our satisfaction over the signing by\r\nJordan and Israel of the Washington Declaration by which\r\nthe two countries mutually agreed to end the state of war\r\nbetween them. This should go a long way in helping to\r\nbuild confidence, facilitating the normalization of\r\nrelations, concluding a formal peace treaty between the\r\ntwo countries and between Israel and other countries in\r\nthe region.\r\nUganda supports efforts with a view to the peaceful\r\nresolution of the problem in the Korean peninsula and\r\nurges all parties to work together to create an atmosphere\r\nthat will help ease the tension and that is conducive to\r\nnegotiating a durable political settlement of the Korean\r\nproblem.\r\nUganda welcomes the developments in Haiti directed\r\ntowards the return of President Aristide and the\r\nrestoration of a democratically elected Government in that\r\ncountry.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nUganda is deeply concerned over the continuing\r\ngenocide and \"ethnic cleansing\" in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe urge the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity to act decisively and to take appropriate steps\r\nto end hostilities in accordance with relevant resolutions of\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council, as well as\r\nthe peace plan of the Contact Group and to create an\r\nenvironment conducive to a smooth and timely flow of\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the people affected.\r\nUganda is encouraged by some positive developments\r\nthat have taken place in the area of disarmament. We note\r\nthe ongoing formal negotiations on a comprehensive\r\nnuclear-test-ban treaty (CTBT), under the auspices of the\r\nConference on Disarmament, and urge successful\r\ncompletion of the CTBT prior to the convening of the\r\nReview Conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to be held early in 1995. As a\r\nState Party to the NPT, and in the context of the\r\npreparatory process and review of the Treaty, Uganda will\r\nseek the removal of all imbalances in the NPT and the\r\nsecuring of adequate technical assistance for developing\r\ncountries in the peaceful application of nuclear technology.\r\nWe also note the progress that is being made to strengthen\r\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)\r\nand Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction through\r\nmeasures such as mandatory data exchanges and periodic\r\non-site visits. These measures are useful in engendering\r\nconfidence in compliance and in helping minimize\r\nviolations of the Convention. We are also encouraged by\r\nthe possibility of the entry into force in mid-1995 of the\r\n1993 chemical weapons Convention.\r\nThe treaty on an African nuclear-free zone will be yet\r\nanother important landmark for peace in Africa. Uganda\r\nurges its timely and successful conclusion.\r\nIt is imperative to consolidate achievements so far\r\nrecorded in the area of nuclear testing and non-proliferation\r\nin order to lay firm ground on which to make progress in\r\nother new and more challenging areas of disarmament.\r\nUganda is committed to the full respect and universal\r\nenjoyment of human rights. We reaffirm our support for\r\nthe Declaration and Programme of Action on human rights,\r\nand welcome the appointment of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. For its part, Uganda has\r\nestablished a human rights national focal point within the\r\nJustice Department aimed at enhancing public awareness\r\nand developing national capacity in the observance and\r\npromotion of human rights in the country. My delegation\r\nwishes to pay special tribute to all countries that have\r\nextended support to Uganda in this vital area of our\r\ndevelopment, and we appeal for continued support.\r\nUganda is committed to democracy, good\r\ngovernance and the rule of law. A democratization\r\nprocess in the country is well under way. The\r\nConstituent Assembly was successfully elected on\r\n28 March 1994. The Assembly is currently debating a\r\ndraft constitution, which is expected to be finalized and\r\npromulgated by the end of 1994. That will be followed\r\nby nationwide presidential and legislative elections in\r\nearly 1995.\r\nUganda is concerned about the current trends in the\r\nglobal economy which continue to weigh unfavourably on\r\nmany developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. Excruciating external indebtedness remains a\r\nmajor impediment to our development. Many of our\r\ncountries are spending large proportions of meagre export\r\nearnings on debt-servicing alone. For instance, as of\r\n30 June 1994 Uganda had a total external public sector\r\ndebt of $2.99 billion — over 80 per cent of estimated\r\ngross domestic product for the 1993-1994 financial year.\r\nContractual debt-servicing was $185 million — almost\r\n76 per cent of export earnings; while arrears to be cleared\r\nwere $222 million — or 91 per cent of export earnings.\r\nThe situation is compounded by the fact that 77 per cent\r\nof the total stock of debt, which is the portion owed to\r\nmultilateral and bilateral institutions, is currently ineligible\r\nfor restructuring or reduction.\r\nThe problem of external indebtedness is further\r\naggravated by unfavourable terms of trade, especially the\r\ncollapse of our export commodity prices, severely\r\ncontracted resource inflows and limited access to\r\ntechnology. In addition to these unfavourable conditions,\r\nmost of our countries are implementing stringent\r\neconomic reforms, with their attendant adverse\r\nsocio-economic implications for our people. This\r\nnotwithstanding, some countries, including Uganda, are\r\nregistering positive economic growth and controlling\r\ninflation.\r\nFor economic reforms to succeed in our countries,\r\nall creditors, including multilateral institutions, should\r\nadopt enhanced measures that go beyond\r\ndebt-rescheduling in order to bring about a substantial\r\nreduction in our total stock of debt. Such measures\r\nshould include substantial debt cancellation or conversion\r\ninto grants and/or other innovative schemes such as the\r\nuse of reserves, a new issue of special drawing rights and\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\ndebt swaps. In this regard Uganda endorses the conclusion\r\nof the recent Jakarta Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial\r\nMeeting on “Debt and Development: Sharing of\r\nExperiences” and also endorses the recent proposal by the\r\nBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer on measures to resolve\r\nthe debt problem of the poorest countries.\r\nEqually, there is a need significantly to increase\r\nresource in-flows to our countries — for example, through\r\nincreased levels of official development assistance; foreign\r\ndirect investment in areas such as manufacturing,\r\nagricultural processing and tourism; and the provision of\r\nremunerative commodity prices. Uganda, in the context of\r\nthe preparatory process and next year’s mid-term global\r\nreview of the Programme of Action for the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, will also seek the adoption of similar\r\nmeasures in favour of the least developed countries.\r\nAs regards the Uruguay Round, Uganda urges that in\r\nthe implementation of the provisions of the Final Act\r\nspecial offsetting measures be adopted to obviate adverse\r\neffects that are likely to arise from the erosion of special\r\npreferences currently enjoyed by some developing countries\r\nunder arrangements such as the Programme of Action for\r\nthe Least Developed Countries and Lomé IV. Further, the\r\nway should be eased for more developing countries to gain\r\nincreased access to international markets for their products,\r\nin order to augment their export earnings. We also urge\r\nthat the necessary assistance be provided to enhance our\r\ncapacity to produce value-added goods and services for\r\ninternational markets.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s “Agenda for Development”,\r\nwhich has been submitted to this session of the General\r\nAssembly, provides a useful framework for political\r\ndialogue between the North and the South on practical\r\nmeasures to make operational the international policies,\r\nprogrammes and actions on development which have so far\r\nbeen adopted by the international community. My\r\ndelegation supports this initiative. As we elaborate on the\r\nAgenda, we should be guided by the overall objective of\r\neffecting a substantial, rapid improvement in the quality of\r\nlife in developing countries, through the eradication of\r\npoverty and the provision of basic needs, namely, nutrition,\r\nshelter, health and education. Equally, we endorse the\r\nproposal made by Brazil for the convening of a United\r\nNations conference on development some time in 1996.\r\nUganda welcomed the fact that the General Assembly,\r\nin its resolution 48/214 on the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s, agreed to\r\naddress the full range of issues related to the diversification\r\nof African economies, with particular attention to be\r\ngiven to the issue of the establishment of a diversification\r\nfund for African commodities. Uganda attaches great\r\nimportance to the establishment of such a fund. We\r\nappeal to our developed partners to be understanding and\r\nflexible in the negotiations in order to enable the facility\r\nto be put in place as soon as possible.\r\nThe international economic system dictates that we\r\nenlarge our economic horizons beyond national\r\nboundaries in order to widen our markets. Uganda\r\nwelcomes the coming into force, of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Abuja Treaty establishing the\r\nAfrican Economic Community, which provides a useful\r\nframework for coordination of African development\r\nefforts at the continental level. In order to succeed,\r\nefforts to be pursued at subregional levels should be well\r\ncoordinated and rationalized. Uganda is committed to full\r\nimplementation of the Treaty for the Common Market for\r\nEastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Arusha\r\nTreaty on revived East African cooperation. We appeal\r\nto the international community to provide requisite\r\nassistance to support our regional integration efforts in\r\norder to strengthen or create infrastructures that facilitate\r\nthe movement of goods and services.\r\nUganda reaffirms its support for Agenda 21 and\r\nother agreements on sustainable development adopted in\r\nRio de Janeiro. However, it is necessary that the Rio\r\npolitical momentum be translated into practical measures\r\nto implement all commitments agreed upon, especially\r\nwith regard to the provision of financial resources and the\r\ntransfer of technology to developing countries. For its\r\npart, Uganda is committed to addressing all causes and\r\neffects of environmental degradation, particularly poverty.\r\nFor instance, we are sparing no efforts in seeking ways\r\nand means to exploit our enormous potential in\r\nhydroelectric power and solar energy, which are\r\nenvironmentally sound and are economic alternatives to\r\nwood fuels. This will help stem the current widespread\r\nforest depletion. We appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to support our efforts in the area of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe most important outcome of the Cairo\r\nConference on population was the endorsement of the\r\nview that the problem of population is not just a question\r\nof numbers; rather, the critical issue is that of human\r\ndevelopment and welfare. In this regard, the challenge is\r\nto improve people\u0027s standard of living in such areas as the\r\nprovision of education and health, housing, transportation,\r\nclean water and sanitation, and to eradicate poverty. In\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\ndeveloping countries especially, population problems that\r\narise from irresponsible parenthood are ultimately a result\r\nof socio-economic despair and ignorance, and these demand\r\nour foremost attention.\r\nAs a follow-up to the 1990 Programme of Action on\r\nchildren, Uganda has established the National Council for\r\nChildren to oversee national activities aimed at their\r\nprotection, promotion and development.\r\nWe support the convening of the Copenhagen World\r\nSummit for Social Development in March 1995 to address\r\nissues of poverty- eradication, productive employment and\r\nsocial integration, which we hope will lead to the\r\nimprovement of standards of living, especially in the most\r\nimpoverished countries. We also support the convening of\r\nthe Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995\r\nto devise measures for the enhancement of gender equality\r\nand the empowerment of women. Uganda will continue to\r\nparticipate actively in the preparatory processes of both\r\nmeetings.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council, in our view,\r\nshould aim at achieving greater transparency in its methods\r\nof work, making it more democratic in decision-making and\r\nreflective of the increased United Nations membership in its\r\ncomposition. We therefore support the proposal to expand\r\nits membership. However, in our view, its expansion\r\nshould increase the number of seats for developing\r\ncountries on an equitable regional basis, to reflect the\r\nincreased membership of developing countries in the United\r\nNations and the fact that the agenda of the Security Council\r\nis increasingly dominated by issues of concern and interest\r\nto developing countries, such as conflict-resolution and\r\nhumanitarian emergencies. As regards the Council\u0027s\r\ndecision-making procedures, our view is that a\r\nproportionate number of developing countries, including\r\nAfrican countries, should be accorded rights and\r\nresponsibilities similar to those currently exercised by\r\npermanent members of the Security Council.\r\nOur legacy to future generations is to put in place a\r\nfirm institutional framework that can adequately and\r\nequitably respond to the interests and concerns of all\r\nmankind, rich and poor alike. This is the challenge that\r\nfaces our Organization as we enter the fiftieth anniversary\r\nyear of the United Nations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Myanmar, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ohn Gyaw.\r\nMr. Gyaw (Myanmar): The delegation of Myanmar\r\nwould like to congratulate you most warmly, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\nninth session and to assure you of our fullest cooperation\r\nin the discharge of your responsibilities. We are\r\nconfident that the wealth of experience and wisdom that\r\nyou bring with you will prove invaluable in guiding us\r\nsuccessfully through the present session.\r\nWe also wish to express our appreciation to the\r\noutgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Rudolph\r\nInsanally, for his sagacious and outstanding stewardship\r\nof the previous session of the General Assembly.\r\nIn South Africa, four decades of the despicable\r\nsystem of apartheid have finally been laid to rest. The\r\nelection of President Nelson Mandela by the country\u0027s\r\nfirst multiracial Parliament has given birth to a united,\r\ndemocratic and non-racial South Africa. A nation that\r\nhas so courageously overcome such adversity and\r\noverwhelming pressure deserves our support and acclaim\r\nas it faces its future with optimism. I am pleased to see\r\nthe delegation of South Africa rejoining us in this\r\nAssembly. Its presence here reflects the momentous\r\nchanges taking place in the world today. The concerted\r\neffort to abolish apartheid in South Africa has finally\r\nsucceeded. We welcome our brothers from South Africa,\r\nwish them every success in rebuilding their nation and\r\nlook forward to working closely with their Government\r\nand people.\r\nThe importance of adhering to the five principles of\r\npeace coexistence that form the basic tenets of Myanmar\u0027s\r\nforeign policy bears reiteration. Myanmar, together with\r\nthe People\u0027s Republic of China and India, enunciated\r\nthose principles nearly five decades ago. These time-\r\ntested principles have crystallized as the universally\r\naccepted legal norms of inter-State relations. In strict\r\nobservance of these principles, Myanmar has never\r\nallowed, and will never allow, its territory to be used as\r\na springboard for action or threats against another State.\r\nBy the same token, Myanmar expects that other nations\r\nwill likewise abide by these principles in their conduct of\r\npolicy towards Myanmar.\r\nAt this time of dramatic and profound changes, the\r\nUnited Nations represents the best hope for mankind in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and in\r\nthe promotion of international cooperation in other areas\r\nof human endeavour. Whatever character and shape the\r\nemerging new international order may eventually assume,\r\nwe have no doubt that the United Nations will constitute\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\na vital element in that new order and will continue to play\r\nan increasingly important role in international relations. As\r\nwe approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\r\nit is the appropriate time for us to rededicate ourselves to\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter and to redouble\r\nour efforts to further strengthen the role of the world\r\nOrganization. In order to mark this auspicious anniversary\r\nin a fitting manner, we have formed a high-level National\r\nCommittee in my country to carry out necessary\r\npreparatory work and to coordinate commemorative\r\nactivities at the national level.\r\nMyanmar firmly believes that the United Nations plays\r\na pivotal role in promoting international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment and for the maintenance of peace and security.\r\nThere is a close link between peace and development; it is\r\ntherefore the view of my delegation that the Agenda for\r\nPeace and the Agenda for Development must go hand in\r\nhand. Now that the cold war is over and the avenues for\r\npeace and development are more pronounced, we would\r\nlike to call upon the international community to create a\r\nfavourable environment that ensures sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy delegation shares the view that at the present time\r\nthe search for security and peace in the world lies in\r\ndevelopment, not in armaments. For most people\r\nthroughout the world, and particularly in developing\r\ncountries, any feeling of insecurity arises more out of\r\nanxieties about daily subsistence than out of the dread of a\r\ncataclysmic global conflict. Underdevelopment creates\r\npoverty, hunger, malnutrition, environmental degradation\r\nand so on, collectively leading to civil strife, ethnic\r\nconflicts and, eventually, the collapse of peace and security.\r\nThese problems may in some instances be confined within\r\nnational borders; however, some will definitely have\r\ninternational and even global ramifications and\r\nconsequences.\r\nBoth “An Agenda for Peace” and “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment” are top-priority tasks facing the United\r\nNations, and they deserve equal attention and equal\r\nallocation of resources. United Nations peace-keeping\r\nmissions are stretched out across the globe, and United\r\nNations agencies for development and humanitarian affairs\r\nfan out over an even wider area. Myanmar shares the view\r\nthat economic and social developments are prerequisites for\r\nlasting peace and security. We would therefore like to see\r\na strengthening of the Economic and Social Council in\r\ntandem with the call for a restructuring of the Security\r\nCouncil to respond adequately to the new challenges of\r\ninternational peace and security that have emerged in the\r\nwake of the cold war. Fifty years ago, against a political\r\nbackground that was very different from today\u0027s, the\r\nUnited Nations was born with the purposes of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, promoting development\r\nand safeguarding human rights. Now that the cold war is\r\nover and the international community is free from the\r\nsuper-Power rivalry that so crippled the United Nations in\r\nthe past, the Organization should be restructured to meet\r\nthe needs and challenges of the present-day world.\r\nPeace-keeping is an area in which the United\r\nNations is being called to take on increasing\r\nresponsibilities. These operations constitute an important\r\ninstrument of the world Organization in the prevention\r\nand containment of conflicts and in keeping peace where\r\nit is most needed. Peace-keeping operations have a\r\nmixed record of successes and some set-backs.\r\nExperience and lessons from past operations should be\r\ncarefully reviewed and re-evaluated to ensure the more\r\neffective and proper conduct of such operations. It is\r\nimperative that United Nations peace-keeping operations\r\nbe carried out only with the consent and willing\r\ncooperation of the parties concerned and that all aspects\r\nof such operations strictly conform to the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter. There is also a\r\nneed for such operations to be rationalized, streamlined\r\nand made more cost effective.\r\nIn the field of disarmament we are encouraged by\r\nthe positive developments of last year. Intensive\r\nnegotiations are now under way in the Geneva-based\r\nConference on Disarmament to achieve a comprehensive\r\nnuclear-test-ban treaty. The steadily increasing trust and\r\nconfidence between nuclear- and non-nuclear-weapon\r\nStates has provided an opportunity for the international\r\ncommunity to come to grips with the prevention of the\r\nvertical and horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons.\r\nThis opportunity should be seized by bringing the\r\nnegotiations on the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty\r\nto a successful conclusion in the most expeditious way.\r\nThe United States has announced its decision to extend\r\nthe moratorium for one year until September 1995. We\r\nbelieve that such a moratorium, if also observed by other\r\nnuclear-weapon States, would create conditions conducive\r\nto the ongoing process of negotiating a comprehensive\r\nnuclear-test-ban treaty.\r\nThe review and extension Conference of the States\r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) is less than a year away. We are of the\r\nview that substantive progress in crucial areas, namely the\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, negative security\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nassurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and a ban on the\r\nproduction of nuclear fissile material in all its aspects, will\r\ncontribute to a successful outcome of the review\r\nConference. A careful evaluation of the progress achieved\r\nin these crucial areas should be made before taking a\r\ndecision at the review Conference on the further extension\r\nof the Treaty. Myanmar looks forward to working and\r\ncooperating with other delegations for the successful\r\noutcome of the 1995 review and extension Conference.\r\nWhile I am on the subject of the NPT, may I take this\r\nopportunity to inform the Assembly that, as a State Party to\r\nthe Treaty, the Myanmar Government has decided to sign\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards\r\nAgreement and Protocol. The signing of the Agreement\r\nand Protocol will take place in the near future.\r\nMyanmar is also actively taking part in the preparatory\r\nprocess for the implementation of the chemical weapons\r\nConvention since becoming an original signatory to it.\r\nLike other signatories to the Convention, the ratification\r\nprocess is currently under way in Myanmar.\r\nThe signature on 4 May 1994 of the agreement to\r\nimplement the Israel-Palestine Declaration of Principles\r\nmarks an important milestone towards a lasting peace in the\r\nMiddle East. The recent approval by the Israeli Cabinet of\r\nthe transfer of civilian powers to the Palestinians in the\r\nareas of culture, youth and sports, international cooperation,\r\neducation, health, social welfare, tourism and finance is\r\nanother positive step that will further pave the way to self-\r\nrule by the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. We\r\ncongratulate the parties concerned for their courage and\r\nmutual accommodation. We are also heartened to note that\r\nboth Israel and Jordan are implementing the Washington\r\nDeclaration signed by both parties in July. It is hoped that\r\nthese initiatives, in the context of both bilateral and\r\nmultilateral negotiations, will facilitate and brighten the\r\nchances of lasting peace in the Middle East.\r\nAfter years of recession and stagnation the world\r\neconomy has resumed a modest growth. However, the\r\nrecovery remains fragile and uneven, and it is in the\r\ninterests of both developing and developed countries to\r\nstrive for accelerated growth and sustainable development.\r\nWhile a number of developing countries have acted as the\r\nmain engines of world economic growth, most of them are\r\nbeset by a deteriorating economic and social situation.\r\nDeveloped countries are also facing slow growth and high\r\nunemployment. In this era of growing globalization and\r\ninterdependence, concerted efforts by the world community\r\nare urgently needed to resolve the acute economic and\r\nsocial problems.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s report, “An\r\nAgenda for Development”, as most timely and\r\nappropriate. The report has highlighted economic growth\r\nas a crucial dimension of development and has singled\r\nout a supportive and favourable international economic\r\nenvironment for sustained growth. We fully share the\r\nview that the advancement of developing countries is\r\nbeing hindered by such obstacles as external-debt\r\nproblems, declining external resource flows, sharply\r\ndeteriorating terms of trade and mounting barriers to\r\nmarket access. We hope that the programme of action on\r\nthe implementation of the agenda will be agreed upon at\r\nthis session.\r\nOur aspirations for a new world economic order\r\nwhich is equitable and non-discriminatory have not yet\r\nbeen realized. The major challenges of these decades —\r\nacceleration of development, alleviation of poverty,\r\nnarrowing the widening gap among countries — need to\r\nbe addressed on an urgent basis. We fully support the\r\ncall by the Group of 77, the Non-Aligned Movement and\r\nthe Assembly for the resumption of the stalled North-\r\nSouth dialogue. A constructive dialogue based on\r\ncommon interests and mutual benefits should enhance\r\ninternational economic cooperation for development.\r\nWe also welcome the successful conclusion of the\r\nUruguay Round, although our aspirations were not fully\r\nrealized. We had hoped for an open, equitable and\r\ntransparent multilateral trading system which would\r\nbenefit all countries. We are most concerned with new\r\nforms of protectionism, particularly the attempts to\r\nimpose social and environmental conditions that\r\ndiscriminate against exports from developing countries.\r\nThese protectionist measures will adversely affect world\r\ntrade and growth.\r\nWe are heartened by the Communiqué issued\r\nfollowing the Naples Summit of the Group of Seven,\r\nwhich states that the Seven will continue efforts to\r\nenhance development assistance, trade and investment in\r\ndeveloping countries. It states also that the Seven favour\r\na reduction in the stock of debt and an increase in\r\nconcessionality for those countries facing special\r\ndifficulties.\r\nMy delegation notes with appreciation the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the status and role of\r\ncooperatives in the light of new economic and social\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\ntrends and welcomes the recommendations contained\r\ntherein. Today, cooperative societies constitute significant\r\ncomponents of the economies of developed and developing\r\ncountries alike and play a crucial role in their economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn my country, we attach great importance to the\r\ncooperative sector as one of the main pillars of our\r\neconomy and as an effective means of accelerating\r\nsocio-economic development. It is an important part of the\r\neconomic strategy of the Myanmar Government to promote\r\nand expand the cooperative sector in our national economy.\r\nAs we shall next year be celebrating the centenary of the\r\nestablishment of the International Cooperative Alliance, it\r\nis most fitting that the Assembly should proclaim the first\r\nSaturday of July 1995 the International Day of Cooperatives\r\nand that Member States should observe this day in future\r\nyears as an annual event.\r\nThe Earth Summit held in Rio two years ago firmly\r\nplaced environmental issues on the global agenda, and since\r\nthen hardly any international meeting has taken place\r\nwithout calls for common action to save our planet. The\r\nprotection and promotion of the environment has emerged\r\nas one of the most pressing issues facing the world. No\r\nlonger is the natural world perceived as a vast and\r\ninexhaustible frontier to be explored and exploited. Today\r\nthere is growing recognition that the environment is not to\r\nbe subjugated, but is to be treated with respect and care.\r\nAn increasing number of countries now recognize that\r\nenvironmental issues warrant as much attention and effort\r\nas issues such as disarmament, narcotics and human rights.\r\nMyanmar is pleased to note that, in all of this, the\r\nregion of Asia and the Pacific has not been left behind. A\r\nregional meeting to prepare for the 1995 report on the state\r\nof the environment was held in Yangon in July this year.\r\nThis meeting provided senior Government officials with an\r\nopportunity to discuss, in an integrated manner, issues\r\nrelated to the assessment of the state of the environment at\r\nthe national and regional levels.\r\nThe region of Asia and the Pacific comprises a large\r\nnumber of nations differing in size, resource endowment\r\nand stage of economic development. It is a region facing\r\nall the conceivable environmental problems of the world -\r\ndeforestation, desertification, climate change, and so on.\r\nWhile several countries of the region, particularly those in\r\nSouth-East and North-East Asia, have registered remarkable\r\neconomic growth in the last few decades; others have yet\r\nto achieve their objectives.\r\nIn many of our countries the eradication of poverty\r\nand greater equity in income distribution remain major\r\nchallenges. Poverty and environmental degradation are\r\nclosely related. Therefore, the alleviation of poverty is no\r\nlonger simply a moral issue; it is a practical imperative.\r\nAt the same time, achieving sustainable development will\r\nrequire that all countries, particularly the developed\r\ncountries, change their consumption patterns.\r\nIn the past we have tended to focus more on\r\nremedial measures than on the causes of environmental\r\ndegradation. But if we are to overcome the challenges\r\nthat we face we must deal with the underlying causes.\r\nAs in the case of health care, prevention is just as\r\nimportant as, if not more important than, cure. We must\r\ntherefore formulate strategies that will set out to alleviate\r\npoverty and provide the basic needs — food, water,\r\nclothing, shelter, energy and health care — of our\r\npeoples, while protecting the environment.\r\nAware of the fact that poverty is the fundamental\r\ncause of environmental degradation, we in Myanmar are\r\nconcentrating on breaking the vicious circle of poverty\r\nand environmental degradation. With a view to\r\nremedying the situation, the Government launched in\r\n1989 a programme for the development of border areas\r\nand national races. This integrated approach is expected\r\nto generate higher incomes and productivity by providing\r\nemployment opportunities and increased welfare.\r\nThe border areas, which are inhabited by the national\r\nraces, have lagged far behind in all aspects of\r\ndevelopment, owing mainly to the difficult terrain and the\r\nlack of an adequate infrastructure. However, the situation\r\nis being improved rapidly. There is extensive building of\r\nroads, bridges, schools, hospitals and reservoirs. The\r\nGovernment’s support for the development of mini-plants\r\nto generate hydroelectric power will result in the\r\nprovision of alternative sources of energy, which will\r\nenable towns and villages to promote rural industries and,\r\nat the same time, lessen their dependence on fuel wood.\r\nThis integrated rural-area-development programme\r\nwill not only have positive effects on the socio-economic\r\nenvironment but also drastically reduce the area under\r\nshifting cultivation. The result will be conservation and\r\nthe regeneration of forest resources in the fragile\r\nmountain ecosystem.\r\nThe sustainable management and conservation of\r\nforests has long occupied a place of pride in Myanmar’s\r\nenvironmental efforts. Sustainable production from forest\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nresources and the conservation of biodiversity are assured\r\nby a forest working plan and a time-tested selective felling\r\nsystem. About 50 per cent of Myanmar’s total land surface\r\nis still covered by natural forests. Even though the forest\r\narea is about 33 million hectares, the prescribed allowable\r\nannual cut is less than 3 million cubic metres for teak and\r\nother hardwoods. This volume of commercial extraction is\r\nsignificantly less than the volume harvested by other\r\ncountries in the region.\r\nThe Government’s current development activities in\r\nthe forest sector include the special project for greening the\r\nnine driest districts of the country; extension of the area\r\nunder reserved forests; the establishment of new\r\nplantations; overall reforestation of the dry zone to provide\r\nmuch-needed timber and fuel wood for rural communities;\r\nand measures to improve the watersheds.\r\nMyanmar attaches high importance to population\r\nissues and recognizes the close link between population and\r\nsustainable development. We participated in the Cairo\r\nConference, and we heartily welcome the adoption by\r\nconsensus of a non-binding 20-year Programme of Action.\r\nOur population-policy focus is on voluntary birth-spacing\r\nto promote the health of mother and child. The Myanmar\r\nMaternal and Child Welfare Association — a non--\r\ngovernmental organization — is actively carrying out its\r\nassigned task in this field.\r\nMuch has been accomplished by the United Nations in\r\nthe field of human rights. The Organization’s most recent\r\naccomplishment in this area is the appointment by\r\nconsensus, at the General Assembly’s last session, of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nThe appointment of such an important personage by\r\nconsensus testifies to the fact that both the developed and\r\nthe developing countries attach importance to the promotion\r\nand protection of human rights, in accordance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. My\r\ndelegation wishes the High Commissioner every success in\r\ncarrying out his mandate.\r\nAs a responsible Member of the United Nations and\r\nas an unwavering advocate of the values that the\r\nOrganization represents, the Union of Myanmar has always\r\nupheld and adhered to the basic norms of human rights, as\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. As is confirmed\r\nby the Bangkok Declaration, the principles of national\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in\r\ninternal affairs should be respected by all nations, and\r\nattempts to use human rights to encroach on the\r\nessentially domestic jurisdiction of States should be\r\navoided.\r\nIn saying this we do not mean that human rights\r\nmay be systematically violated behind the barrier of\r\nnon-interference. We wish to see human rights promoted\r\nthrough cooperation and consensus-building, and not\r\nthrough the imposition of values that we do not share.\r\nWe believe that, even as we seek universality of\r\nhuman rights, we must never minimize or forget diversity\r\nin historical, cultural and religious backgrounds. We are\r\nalso against double standards and the temptation to use\r\nhuman rights as a means of achieving political ends.\r\nThe right to sufficient food, clothing and shelter, the\r\nright to a decent quality of life and the right to live\r\npeacefully and in security are often neglected in the\r\nclamour for individual rights. At this delicate juncture in\r\nour history, when Myanmar is in the midst of\r\ntransforming itself to a multi-party democracy with a\r\nmarket economy, the interests of its 45 million people as\r\na whole must take precedence over the interests of any\r\nindividual. Confrontation and incitement to unrest and\r\ninstability have no place when the nation is in the process\r\nof reconciliation and reconsolidation.\r\nIn keeping with the aspirations of all the national\r\nraces, Myanmar is also at present at the critical stage of\r\ndrafting a firm constitution. My Government would\r\ncertainly not like to see the present momentum of the\r\nconstitutional process and the efforts for national\r\nreconciliation impeded in any way, nor can it allow a\r\nreturn to the chaos and anarchy of the incidents of 1988.\r\nThe Myanmar Government does not condone human\r\nrights abuses. In fact, it is totally against them. We have\r\ncooperated fully with the United Nations in every field\r\nand, in this regard, with the Commission on Human\r\nRights by providing information in connection with\r\ncommunications and queries concerning the situation in\r\nMyanmar. Not only have we provided information sought\r\nby the Commission, but we have also received the\r\nIndependent Experts and the Special Rapporteur appointed\r\nby the Commission on Human Rights. The Special\r\nRapporteur, Mr. Yozo Yokota, was received in 1992 and\r\nin 1993. In deference to the United Nations and as a\r\ngesture of our goodwill and cooperation, we will receive\r\nhim again this year.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nThe Memorandum of Understanding between\r\nMyanmar and the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) signed on\r\n5 November 1993, setting out UNHCR’s role in Myanmar’s\r\nborder development projects, is an illustration of our steady\r\ncooperation with the United Nations and its subsidiary\r\nbodies. It is normal that some issues should arise from\r\ntime to time between neighbouring States. In such cases,\r\nwe always seek peaceful solutions based on mutual\r\ngoodwill, respect and understanding. A case in point is the\r\nmatter of transport and movement of people between\r\nMyanmar and Bangladesh across our common border.\r\nAlthough some quarters tried to exaggerate the situation by\r\ninvoking potential regional destabilization, our two\r\ncountries were able to resolve the situation in a spirit of\r\nmutual friendship and understanding resulting in the\r\nrepatriation so far of nearly 70,000 returnees to their\r\nhearths and homes.\r\nAt the initiative of the Secretary-General, Myanmar\r\ndecided to establish a dialogue with the United Nations to\r\nexchange views on various issues of common concern. I\r\nshould like briefly to apprise the Assembly of the\r\ndevelopments leading to this decision.\r\nDuring his visit to Myanmar in March this year,\r\nUnder-Secretary-General Mr. Rafeeudin Ahmed, Executive\r\nSecretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia\r\nand the Pacific (ESCAP), delivered a letter and a verbal\r\nmessage from the Secretary-General to Secretary I of the\r\nState Law and Order Restoration Council. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in his letter, made constructive remarks in regard\r\nto the measures taken by the Myanmar Government and\r\nshowed keen interest in the developments in Myanmar,\r\nparticularly the process of national reconciliation and steps\r\ntaken in drafting a firm constitution through the National\r\nConvention. The Secretary-General also expressed his\r\ndesire to establish a dialogue with the Government of the\r\nUnion of Myanmar to exchange views on the various issues\r\nwith a view to considering how the United Nations could\r\nassist in facilitating continued progress towards the\r\nresolution of these issues. Secretary I, in his\r\nacknowledgment, informed the Secretary-General that a\r\ncommunication would be made on this subject in the near\r\nfuture.\r\nWhile attending the Ministerial Meeting of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations in Bangkok, I\r\ntransmitted, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nThailand, on 21 July 1994, our initial response to the\r\nSecretary-General. Further to this response, the Myanmar\r\nGovernment informed the Executive Secretary of ESCAP\r\nthat the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Myanmar had\r\nbeen designated to initiate the dialogue proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General at a mutually agreeable date and, in\r\nthis regard, sought his advice on the modalities of\r\ncarrying out such a dialogue more fruitfully. I am happy\r\nto apprise the Assembly through you, Sir, that I had two\r\nmeetings earlier this month with Mr. Marrack Goulding,\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Political Affairs of the\r\nUnited Nations, and that the dialogue between the\r\nMyanmar Government and the United Nations is now\r\nwell under way.\r\nThe global spread of drug abuse has become a major\r\ninternational concern in recent years. The evil\r\nconsequences of illicit drugs transcend borders and the\r\nthreat of illicit drugs can be overcome only with effective\r\ninternational cooperation. We share the view that\r\nconcerted action is needed at the national, subregional,\r\nregional and global levels.\r\nMyanmar has always treated anti-narcotics measures\r\nas a national responsibility. At the national level, the\r\nGovernment has adopted comprehensive plans for the\r\neffective implementation of drug-suppression measures.\r\nA new law against narcotic drugs and psychotropic\r\nsubstances was enacted in 1993, encompassing effective\r\nmeasures against the widening scope of the drug menace.\r\nIn our national strategies against drugs, a new approach\r\nwas launched in 1988, the key concept of which was to\r\nalleviate the poverty of the peoples of the border areas by\r\nproviding them with a means of alternative income, while\r\nat the same time working to raise their awareness of the\r\nmagnitude of human misery resulting from drugs. This\r\napproach is being carried out as one of the main\r\nobjectives of our master plan for the development of the\r\nborder areas and national races. It is evident that the\r\nmost effective approach to the eradication of poppy\r\ncultivation would be to implement a comprehensive\r\nprogramme for the social and economic development of\r\nthe national races in the border areas. We have now\r\nestablished a mechanism for coordinating action against\r\nillicit drugs in all their aspects.\r\nWe have also been coordinating our national efforts\r\nwith those of our neighbours to ensure a maximum\r\nimpact in drug eradication in the region. The Myanmar\r\nGovernment has signed agreements with the People’s\r\nRepublic of China and the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme (UNDCP), as well as with\r\nThailand and the UNDCP. Bilateral narcotics-suppression\r\nagreements have been signed with Laos and India, and we\r\naim to work out a similar agreement with Bangladesh. In\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nOctober 1993, in New York, Myanmar, the People’s\r\nRepublic of China, Laos, Thailand and the UNDCP signed\r\na Memorandum of Understanding which would further\r\nharmonize collective activities aimed at reducing drug\r\ntrafficking and production, eliminating poppy cultivation\r\nand reducing drug demand and consumption. There have\r\nbeen two ministerial conferences at the subregional level in\r\nwhich Myanmar has actively participated. Myanmar is a\r\nState party to the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic\r\nDrugs and to the 1988 United Nations Convention against\r\nIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\r\nSubstances. Moreover, on 7 June this year Myanmar\r\ndeposited the instrument of accession to the United Nations\r\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances. We are also\r\ncarrying out a series of measures in implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Global Programme of\r\nAction adopted at the seventeenth special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in February 1990.\r\nMembers of the Myanmar security forces are engaged\r\nin a relentless war against drug trafficking. They may not\r\nbe wearing blue helmets like the men and women from\r\ndifferent lands serving as guardians of peace under the\r\nUnited Nations banner, but the cause for which hundreds of\r\nthem have sacrificed life and limb is no less internationalist\r\nand no less worthy. There are those who express doubt\r\nabout our commitment to the eradication of narcotics, and\r\nI would ask them: “Which country in the world has\r\nsacrificed the lives of over 190 soldiers, with an additional\r\n350 wounded, in the combat against drug traffickers in a\r\nmatter of only four weeks?” With this serious dedication\r\nand commitment in the fight against illicit drugs, we in\r\nMyanmar are ready and willing to cooperate fully with all\r\nour neighbours and the international community for\r\nsustained efforts against this scourge.\r\nMyanmar is a union of over 100 different national\r\nraces residing there. Unity among the different national\r\nraces is essential for the preservation of our independence\r\nand sovereignty as well as for the economic and social\r\nprogress of our country. Since regaining independence in\r\n1948, Myanmar unfortunately has had to face internal strife\r\nstarted by various armed groups. Because of this, the\r\ncountry has suffered immensely and lagged behind in\r\neconomic development in comparison with other nations of\r\nthe region. In these dire circumstances, it is only natural\r\nthat the State Law and Order Restoration Council should\r\nattach the utmost importance to the preservation of\r\nindependence and the strengthening of unity and national\r\nsolidarity among all the national races of Myanmar. Since\r\nit assumed the responsibilities of the State, the State Law\r\nand Order Restoration Council has given priority to the\r\nachievement of national reconciliation.\r\nBeginning in 1989, less than one year after it\r\nassumed responsibility, the Government made overtures\r\nto the armed groups to return to the legal fold. Since\r\nApril 1992, the armed forces have suspended military\r\noffensives against the armed groups in the interest of\r\nnational reconciliation. Over four decades of internal\r\nstrife has not benefited anyone, but has only caused death\r\nand destruction and untold suffering for the people.\r\nNo one appreciates peace more than a soldier. It is\r\ntherefore most gratifying that a total of 12 groups having\r\ntrust in the sincerity of the Government’s offer have\r\nreturned to the legal fold and are working together with\r\nthe Government for the development of their regions.\r\nThese groups are also being provided with the opportunity\r\nto participate in the national political process — the\r\nNational Convention — to shape the country’s future.\r\nWith the Shan State Nationalities Peoples’ Liberation\r\nOrganization, which returned to the legal fold on 9\r\nOctober 1994, the armed groups in the reconciliation\r\nprocess now number 13. They will be integrated in the\r\nsame manner as previous groups that are participating in\r\nthe National Convention.\r\nTo the remaining groups that have yet to return to\r\nthe legal fold, the Myanmar Government reiterates its call\r\nnot to miss this golden opportunity but to join hands in\r\nbuilding a peaceful, democratic and modern union. Guns\r\nhave fallen silent in the country as never before in the\r\nhistory of modern Myanmar, and these groups should\r\nlook at the greater interest of the country and work for\r\nthe benefit of all the national races, in accordance with\r\nthe proclamations they themselves have been making for\r\nso long.\r\nAt this juncture, let me turn to another aspect of the\r\nGovernment’s objectives: the drafting of a firm and\r\nenduring constitution. Towards this end, a National\r\nConvention has been meeting since the beginning of last\r\nyear to draft a new constitution. Consensus has already\r\nbeen reached on the 15 chapter headings for the 104\r\nfundamental principles of the State and for the chapters\r\non State, State structure and Head of State.\r\nAt the resumed session of the National Convention,\r\nwhich commenced on 2 September 1994, the Chairman of\r\nthe National Convention Convening Work Committee\r\nelucidated the points relative to the matter of self-\r\nadministered divisions or self-administered zones in the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nUnion, and to constituting the legislative, executive and\r\njudicial branches for detailed discussions and deliberations\r\namong the delegates. As for those who allege that the\r\nprocess is moving too slowly, let me ask: Is the world\r\ntoday not full of examples where too much haste has led to\r\nchaos and confusion, even to armed conflict and the\r\ndisintegration of nations?\r\nAt the same time, let me assure the Assembly that the\r\nState Law and Order Restoration Council has no intention\r\nof unnecessarily prolonging the process or causing delays.\r\nHowever, a balance must be struck between the need to\r\nreach consensus among the nearly 700 delegates on very\r\nurgent and vital issues, such as the national races, and the\r\ndesire for the process to be completed in timely fashion.\r\nAnyone following these deliberations closely will realize\r\nthat they lucidly give the lie to the allegations that the\r\ndeliberations in the National Convention were orchestrated\r\nby the Government.\r\nAt the same time, I wish to indicate to certain\r\nobservers that in our society reaching consensus is more\r\nimportant than debating who is right or wrong or who won\r\nthe debate. We would like the constitution to reflect as\r\nmuch as possible the wishes of the national races, while at\r\nthe same time we would be most happy if consensus on the\r\nremaining chapters could be reached as soon as possible.\r\nWhat the Government has done, and is doing at the\r\nmoment, is to ensure peace, stability, law and order while\r\nstriving for the economic development of the entire nation\r\nso that the transition to democracy will be smooth and\r\ntranquil.\r\nToday the National Convention is in full session for\r\nfurther discussions on the fundamental principles to be\r\nenshrined in the new constitution. The very fact that the\r\nnew State structure will be a union system is a\r\nmanifestation of the consensus that has been reached by the\r\nConvention. The new Union of Myanmar that is envisaged\r\nby the National Convention will be a genuine multi-party,\r\ndemocratic State in order to bring the nation modernity,\r\nunity, stability, peace and harmony. The new constitution\r\nwill have safeguards to guarantee non-disintegration of the\r\nUnion, non-disintegration of national solidarity and\r\nperpetuation of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nAs in the case of other modern Constitutions, the three\r\norgans of government - the legislative, executive and\r\njudicial — will be properly constituted and separated as\r\nmuch as possible and will be able to exert reciprocal\r\ncontrol with checks and balances among themselves.\r\nAmong the fundamental principles already laid down,\r\nindependent administration of justice in accordance with\r\nthe law, administration of justice in public except where\r\nrestricted by law, the right to defence and the right of\r\nappeal will be guaranteed. Furthermore, there will be\r\nconstitutional remedies, and the Supreme Court will have\r\nthe power to issue writs.\r\nCitizens will be able to enjoy the rule of law, which\r\nis the fundamental legal safeguard necessary for a\r\ndemocratic State. Because of the separation of powers\r\nenvisaged in the new constitution, the judiciary will be\r\nthe ultimate guardian of fundamental rights. Freedom of\r\nthought, freedom of expression, freedom of belief,\r\nfreedom of worship, freedom to seek a livelihood and\r\nfreedom of organization will be guaranteed. There will\r\nbe equality of status, equality of opportunity and equality\r\nbefore the law.\r\nThe entire Myanmar nation is currently engaged in\r\nour national endeavour to establish a truly democratic and\r\nmodern society in accordance with the aspirations of our\r\npeople. We the people of the Union of Myanmar are\r\ndoing our utmost to advance the ongoing political and\r\nconstitutional process and the current programme of\r\nnational economic development in the interest of all our\r\nnational brethren.\r\nWe have a popular saying in Myanmar:\r\n“As we sow in our deeds, so shall we surely\r\nreap in our future destiny.”\r\nWe are therefore fully confident that, with continued\r\ndedication, determination and diligence in our national\r\nendeavour, we will surely be able to successfully establish\r\na democratic society based on the universal values of\r\njustice, liberty and equality.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Zambia, His\r\nExcellency the Honourable Mr. Remmy Mushota.\r\nMr. Mushota (Zambia): Let me join the\r\nrepresentatives who have spoken before me in\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your unanimous election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. You represent a country, Côte d’Ivoire, which\r\nhas played and continues to play an active role in the\r\nframework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nand in the United Nations. You bring to the presidency\r\nvast experience in the area of international relations as\r\nwell as diplomatic skill and acumen, which puts you in\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\ngood stead to steer the deliberations of the General\r\nAssembly to a successful conclusion. You can count on\r\nmy delegation’s unqualified support and cooperation.\r\nI also wish to express my delegation’s sincere\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who presided\r\nover the work of the forty-eighth session with great\r\ndistinction and rare personal attributes.\r\nMr. Blandino Canto (Dominican Republic), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nOur distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, has continued to provide outstanding\r\nleadership in the discharge of his duties. Zambia is\r\nparticularly grateful to the Secretary-General for his\r\nuntiring efforts in pursuit of world peace and security,\r\ndevelopment and international cooperation.\r\nThe past year has been one of mixed blessings on the\r\ninternational scene, a year of notable achievements and\r\nfailures. In the view of Zambia, the most positive\r\ndevelopment of the year was the achievement of majority\r\nrule in the Republic of South Africa. My delegation is\r\nreally delighted to see in our midst the delegation of a\r\ndemocratic and non-racial South Africa, led by President\r\nNelson Mandela. President Mandela was the symbol of the\r\nliberation struggle in South Africa and it is therefore\r\nbefitting that he, an icon of the liberation struggle, should\r\nbecome the first President of a new South Africa.\r\nThe return of South Africa to the family of the United\r\nNations is without a doubt due to the tenacity,\r\nuncompromising commitment and dedication of our\r\nbrothers and sisters in South Africa who bore the brunt of\r\nthe evil system of apartheid. At the same time, it cannot be\r\ndenied that South Africa’s victory over apartheid and its\r\nrejoining the United Nations is a concrete manifestation of\r\nthe seminal role played by this Organization.\r\nIn order to consolidate the democracy achieved in\r\nSouth Africa and address the negative social and economic\r\nlegacy of apartheid, substantial international assistance is\r\nimperative. In this regard, Zambia endorses the appeal\r\nmade by President Nelson Mandela for international support\r\nto South Africa to enable the effective implementation of\r\nits reconstruction and development programme.\r\nA democratic, peaceful and prosperous South Africa\r\nwill no doubt have a positive impact on southern Africa and\r\nthe African continent as a whole. Indeed, South Africa’s\r\ncontribution as a member of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community has already begun to be felt and\r\nappreciated. It has, together with Botswana and\r\nZimbabwe, also played a highly commendable role in the\r\npeaceful resolution of the constitutional problem in\r\nLesotho. We have every confidence, therefore, that South\r\nAfrica will contribute positively to the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAfrica has had a few other bright spots. We are\r\ndelighted with the peaceful resolution of the territorial\r\ndispute between Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nThe positive developments in Burundi towards a peaceful\r\nresolution of the long-standing conflict are commendable.\r\nHowever, the situation remains volatile. There is\r\ntherefore a need to sustain international engagement.\r\nWith regard to Angola, it is indeed gratifying that\r\nthe talks between the Government of Angola and National\r\nUnion for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),\r\nwhich have been taking place in Lusaka, Zambia, for the\r\npast eleven months under the chairmanship of the United\r\nNations Secretary-General’s Special Representative,\r\nMr. Alioune Blondin Beye, have made tremendous\r\nprogress. We therefore look forward to a successful\r\nconclusion of the talks by the end of October, culminating\r\nin the signing of a peace agreement, by the middle of\r\nNovember 1994, on the basis of the Bicesse Accords, and\r\nthe pertinent resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nIn this regard, we take this opportunity to commend\r\nboth the Angolan Government and the UNITA delegation\r\nfor their seriousness and commitment to the task of\r\nfinding a peaceful solution to their country’s fratricidal\r\nwar. We also thank the observers to these talks, namely\r\nthe United States, the Russian Federation and Portugal.\r\nSustained international assistance to Angola will be\r\nnecessary in the post-agreement era and Zambia will\r\ncontinue to assist the people of Angola during this period.\r\nIn Mozambique, we look forward to the holding of\r\nthe first multiparty elections, scheduled to take place on\r\n27 and 28 October. We commend the Mozambican\r\nGovernment and RENAMO for committing themselves to\r\nthe United Nations peace initiative and to the Rome\r\nAgreement. We applaud the role that the United Nations\r\nhas played through its peace-keeping efforts and in\r\nhelping to prepare the people of Mozambique for the\r\nforthcoming elections. As a gesture of solidarity with the\r\npeople of Mozambique, Zambia has made a modest\r\ncontribution to the United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperation.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nIn Malawi, we welcome the recent peaceful and\r\ndemocratic transition to a multiparty system of government.\r\nWe endorse the appeal made by President Bakili Muluzi for\r\ninternational assistance to consolidate democracy and to\r\nassist in the reconstruction of the country. My Government\r\nalso commends the technical and advisory services provided\r\nby the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nZambia welcomes the positive trend towards\r\ndemocratization on the African continent. Why should\r\nAfrica democratize? Africa should democratize because it\r\nis our firm belief that democratic systems of government\r\npromote good governance, transparency and accountability\r\nin the administration of public affairs, independence of the\r\njudiciary, and respect for human rights and the rule of law.\r\nThese qualities lay a firm basis for peace and stability and\r\nare thus conducive to sustainable development. We would\r\ntherefore urge all of our development partners to take\r\naccount of all these positive developments in the\r\nformulation of their development policies towards Africa.\r\nThey should also endeavour to explain to their taxpayers\r\nthe significance of these democratic changes and their\r\ncorrelation to sustainable development. The electorates of\r\nthe North must be made to appreciate that it is in their\r\nenlightened self-interest to support developing countries.\r\nThere is now much hope in Africa. Indeed, Africa, in the\r\nlong run, holds the promise of a positive and prosperous\r\nfuture.\r\nIn the Middle East, we welcome the positive\r\ndevelopments in Palestine following the agreements and\r\ndeclarations between the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\n(PLO) and Israel, as well as between Jordan and Israel. It\r\nis our sincere hope that progress can also be achieved in\r\nthe negotiations with the Syrian Arab Republic and\r\nLebanon. International assistance is urgently required for\r\nthe reconstruction, rehabilitation and other essential needs\r\nof the Palestinians.\r\nWe commend the efforts deployed by the leadership\r\nof the PLO and of Israel, their tenacity and their\r\ndetermination to work for peace. We also commend the\r\ncrucial catalytic roles played by the United States of\r\nAmerica and the Russian Federation as co-sponsors of the\r\ntalks. The Kingdom of Norway also deserves our gratitude\r\nfor its contribution to the peace talks. The sustained\r\nsupport and commitment of the Arab League to the peace\r\nprocess also merit special mention.\r\nOn the other hand, negative developments abound in\r\nAfrica and elsewhere on the international scene. These\r\nconflict situations continue to defy durable solutions\r\nthrough dialogue, reconciliation and negotiation, in stark\r\ncontrast with the exemplary cases I have just cited.\r\nThus, in our region, the civil wars in Liberia,\r\nRwanda, Somalia and the Sudan torment us all because of\r\nour aversion to fratricidal and ethnic violence and the\r\nserious humanitarian crises they have engendered. In this\r\nconnection, Zambia also strongly condemns ethnic\r\nviolence wherever it occurs, including in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nWe deplore the further deterioration of the situation\r\nin Liberia. We regret the lack of progress towards\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and general elections. We\r\nappeal to all the parties to commit themselves to the\r\nCotonou and Akosombo Peace Agreements. We also\r\nwish to stress the need to maintain the Military Observer\r\nGroup of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOMOG) in Liberia and to provide it with the\r\nrequisite logistical support.\r\nAs for Rwanda, we and the entire world community\r\nhave been deeply shocked by the genocide and the most\r\ndehumanizing spectre of violence in that country,\r\nresulting in one of the worst humanitarian and refugee\r\ncrises in the history of mankind. Zambia has expressed\r\nits strong condemnation of the genocide and mindless\r\nviolence in Rwanda. We strongly feel that those\r\nresponsible for the massacres must be brought to trial\r\nthrough an international tribunal. Conditions of peace,\r\nsecurity, stability and confidence should be created in\r\nRwanda in order to facilitate the repatriation of refugees\r\nfrom overburdened neighbouring countries. We hope that\r\nthe new Government will commit itself to carrying out its\r\ndeclared intention to work for reconciliation, rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction in Rwanda. Substantial assistance for\r\nhumanitarian, rehabilitation and reconstruction purposes\r\nis thus crucial. The neighbouring asylum countries also\r\nneed assistance.\r\nThe role and efforts of the United Nations\r\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in creating\r\nconditions of stability and security in the country are\r\ncrucial. We therefore deeply regret the delay in the\r\ndeployment of UNAMIR troops to the level of 5,500 in\r\naccordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nIn this regard, African countries have been ready and\r\nwilling to send sufficient troops. However, the major\r\nconstraint has been inadequate logistical support.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nAs a token measure, Zambia has contributed a\r\npeace-keeping contingent of civilian and military personnel\r\nto the UNAMIR operation, thanks to the generous logistical\r\nsupport, in materiel, from the Netherlands. Furthermore,\r\nthe Zambian Peace Corps, a non-governmental organization,\r\nhas organized activities to raise funds to purchase\r\nmedicines, food and other humanitarian requirements for\r\nthe displaced people in Rwanda.\r\nWe remain concerned by the continuing crisis in\r\nSomalia and by the lack of progress. We note, however,\r\nthe genuine efforts being deployed to resolve the crisis.\r\nNotwithstanding the difficulties, we strongly believe that\r\nthe continued presence of the United Nations in Somalia is\r\ncritical.\r\nIn Sudan, the continuing civil war and factional\r\nfighting in the south and the deteriorating human rights\r\nsituation nationwide are a cause of serious concern to us in\r\nZambia. We urge the parties to reach a negotiated\r\nsettlement.\r\nAs to Haiti, Zambia reaffirms its support for the\r\nefforts of the Organization of American States and the\r\nUnited Nations to restore democracy and respect for human\r\nrights there, in accordance with the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nWith regard to Cuba, we reaffirm our belief that the\r\ntime has come for the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo against Cuba to be lifted. We hope that our two\r\nfriends the United States and Cuba will resolve their\r\ndifferences peacefully. In this regard, we are encouraged\r\nby the recent dialogue between the two countries.\r\nZambia attaches great importance to the role of\r\nregional organizations in addressing conflict situations. In\r\nthis respect we note with satisfaction the increasingly active\r\nrole played by the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nincluding at regional and subregional levels, to address the\r\nroot causes of conflicts and to prevent, manage and resolve\r\nthem.\r\nIn particular, in June of last year the OAU established\r\na mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution\r\nof conflicts in order for Africa to deal effectively with\r\nconflict situations on its own. For too long and too often,\r\nAfrica has relied on external assistance to resolve its\r\nconflicts. The time has come for Africa to handle these\r\nsituations resolutely. Conflicts continue to sap Africa’s\r\nenergies, to waste its scarce resources and to retard its\r\ndevelopment. They must be eliminated in order to create\r\nan environment conducive to economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nZambia therefore appeals to the international\r\ncommunity to contribute generously to the OAU Fund\r\nestablished to sustain the Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution. International\r\nsupport is critical to the effective implementation of this\r\nimportant initiative. It is warranted by the fact that the\r\nUnited Nations, through the Security Council, exercises\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIt is now evident that peace and development not\r\nonly are interrelated but are indivisible. This has been\r\nbrought into prominence by the comprehensive reports of\r\nthe Secretary-General entitled \"Agenda for Peace\" and\r\n\"Agenda for Development\". Indeed, in a number of\r\nconflict situations poverty and deprivation have been the\r\nunderlying causes. There is, therefore, a compelling case\r\nto bring development and related issues to the centre\r\nstage of the United Nations, in order to promote the cause\r\nof peace in its most comprehensive perspective.\r\nWe therefore welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\npreliminary report on the \"Agenda for Development\". My\r\ndelegation fully supports the views of the Group of 77 on\r\nthis subject, as reflected in its Ministerial Declaration of\r\n30 September 1994. In particular, an Agenda for\r\nDevelopment must be action-oriented and focus on the\r\neconomic growth and development of the developing\r\ncountries, especially the least developed amongst them.\r\nThe Agenda for Development must strengthen the role of\r\nthe United Nations in the area of international economic\r\npolicy-making and coordination.\r\nAfrica is in economic crisis. It continues to face\r\ngrave economic difficulties. Africa therefore needs a\r\nfavourable international economic environment for the\r\npromotion of investment flows, increased official\r\ndevelopment assistance, technological transfer, improved\r\ntrade opportunities and better terms of trade. Africa\r\nfurther needs a viable and comprehensive solution for its\r\nhuge debt burden. Such a debt strategy should include\r\ndebt cancellation. In this regard, we fully support the\r\npositions of the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement.\r\nZambia welcomes the conclusion of the Uruguay\r\nRound and the Agreement to establish the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) with effect from January of next\r\nyear. It is our expectation that the World Trade\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nOrganization will promote a non-discriminatory and\r\npredictable trading system and protect the rights and\r\ninterests of the developing countries.\r\nIn view of the increasing economic disparity between\r\nthe developed and the developing countries, the WTO will\r\nnot start on a level playing field. In this connection, it is\r\nthe strong view of my delegation that the implementation\r\nof the Uruguay Round must be monitored constantly to\r\nensure that the interests of developing countries are\r\nadequately protected. Compensation should be provided to\r\nthose developing countries that are facing difficulties,\r\nparticularly the least developed.\r\nLet me now address Zambia’s economic and political\r\nsituation. On the economic front, we have followed,\r\nresolutely, a credible macro-economic reform programme\r\nwhose main objective is to promote growth with stability\r\nbased on an equitable allocation of resources. The main\r\npolicy thrusts of the programme include strict control of the\r\nmoney supply and credit, with the aim of keeping inflation\r\nto minimal levels; liberalization of the economy with\r\ngreater reliance on market forces; and implementation of\r\nthe privatization programme, through which previously\r\nState-owned enterprises are to be turned into private\r\nconcerns in order to reduce direct Government participation\r\nin the economy.\r\nAlthough these measures are expected to yield positive\r\nresults in the long run, they have had some short-term\r\nnegative effects, such as a drastic reduction in employment\r\nlevels in the formal sector, a decline in income level, and\r\na marked increase in both the level and the intensity of\r\npoverty, especially in the rural areas and among the\r\nvulnerable segments of the population. To cushion the poor\r\nfrom these adverse effects of economic adjustment, a social\r\nsafety net has been created to assist those who lose their\r\njobs or who are unable to meet their basic needs or obtain\r\nsocial services. It is going to be a long haul, but the\r\nZambian Government is determined to rise above these\r\nchallenges.\r\nI should be remiss if I did not express gratitude to all\r\nour development partners for the economic, financial and\r\ntechnical support rendered to our country. The support\r\nprovided Zambia by our development partners will serve to\r\nunderpin our structural adjustment programme, to which our\r\nGovernment remains committed. More importantly, such\r\nassistance will help to consolidate our democratization\r\nprocess, which we initiated in 1991 with the reintroduction\r\nof plural politics. In this regard, my delegation is pleased\r\nto assure the international community that Zambia’s\r\ndemocratization process remains firmly on course.\r\nThere is a strong connection between the plan of\r\naction adopted at the Cairo Conference on Population, the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, to be held in\r\nCopenhagen early next year, and the World Conference\r\non Women, to be held in Beijing, next September. The\r\nWorld Summit on Social Development will be an\r\nopportunity for the international community to renew its\r\ncommitment and political will to effectively address a\r\nnumber of social and economic problems.\r\nThe contribution made by women to development\r\nefforts is very clear, although it is often underestimated.\r\nWe therefore look forward to Beijing’s programme of\r\naction, which we trust will ensure the full and equal\r\nparticipation of women at all levels of human activity.\r\nWith regard to the environment, the international\r\ncommunity is faced with the major challenge of giving\r\npractical effect to the concept of sustainable development\r\nas reflected in Agenda 21. To do this, effective\r\ninternational cooperation is vital. In particular, practical\r\nsteps must be taken to provide access to appropriate\r\ntechnologies and to mobilize new and additional financial\r\nresources for the countries in need: the developing\r\ncountries. My delegation therefore calls on the developed\r\ncountries to fulfil the solemn commitments undertaken at\r\nthe Rio Earth Summit. At the same time, the task at hand\r\nis global and must thus be shared globally. It involves\r\nindividuals, community groups, non-governmental\r\norganizations, Governments and financial institutions. In\r\nthe language of the Earth Summit, \"common but\r\ndifferentiated responsibilities\" (A/CONF.151/26 (Vol. I)\r\nPrinciple 7) is now imperative.\r\nZambia attaches high priority to environmental\r\nissues. As a reflection of our commitment, we have\r\nformulated a National Environmental Action Plan aimed\r\nat integrating environmental concerns into our\r\nsocio-economic development plans. We have taken\r\ndeliberate measures to increase the level of public\r\nawareness of environmental issues, particularly through\r\nthe active involvement of non-governmental organizations\r\nand community groups.\r\nMy Government is firmly committed to the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. We believe that it is the duty and\r\nresponsibility of all Governments to do so, regardless of\r\ntheir political, economic or cultural systems.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nIn the aftermath of the Vienna World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights, we should work to implement its important\r\nrecommendations. Accordingly, my delegation will support\r\ngenuine efforts in this direction during the current session.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the establishment of the Office of\r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights and the\r\nappointment of Mr. José Ayala Lasso to this high office.\r\nMr. Lasso has already proven his suitability for the\r\nappointment, and we commend his important initiatives\r\nconcerning human rights situations in Africa and elsewhere.\r\nMy delegation also supports the strengthening of the United\r\nNations Centre for Human Rights in Geneva.\r\nMy Government has also established a Human Rights\r\nCommission, which is responsible for investigating alleged\r\nhuman rights violations in Zambia, including those\r\ncommitted prior to the reintroduction of plural politics in\r\n1991. In the spirit of our policy of transparency, the\r\nGovernment will publish the Commission’s findings in a\r\nreport to be made available to the general public. Zambia\r\nis thus firmly committed to the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights and to other relevant international covenants\r\nand instruments.\r\nIn the area of disarmament and arms control, my\r\ndelegation strongly supports efforts to accelerate the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons and to conclude a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. We also fully support the\r\nreview and extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\n(NPT), which is scheduled to take place next year.\r\nHowever, we share the view that any extension of the NPT\r\nshould be linked to progress on nuclear disarmament and to\r\nthe conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\r\nZambia welcomes the significant progress achieved in\r\nthe Geneva negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\r\nWe further support the case for a convention on\r\nconventional weapons and welcome the introduction of the\r\nUnited Nations Register of Conventional Arms with a view\r\nto promoting transparency and confidence-building.\r\nZambia welcomes the successful conclusion during the\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly, of the\r\nagreement relating to the implementation of part XI of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which\r\nopened the way for the universal acceptance of the\r\nConvention and its provisions.\r\nLet me now turn to the United Nations itself. As we\r\nmeet in this session on the threshold of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we have\r\nto recognize that the fundamental meaning of the United\r\nNations Charter has remained unchanged; that the United\r\nNations has undergone periods of both triumph and\r\ndisillusionment; that the United Nations is still an\r\ninternational organization for the people as well as of the\r\npeople and it is therefore supposed to be a democratic\r\ninstitution. It is now time to reflect on a United Nations\r\nthat will serve mankind for another 50 years after 1995.\r\nIt will have to be a new United Nations, one which will\r\nsuit the exigencies of the twenty-first century. It will be\r\nnecessary to sharpen the mechanisms that were\r\nestablished to give effect to the declared principles and\r\npurposes of the Charter. It is only by going through this\r\nmetamorphosis that our Organization will be able to adapt\r\nto a changed and changing environment, to new demands,\r\nnew opportunities and new challenges.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation is of the\r\nconsidered view that expansion of the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council is extremely important. Regions of the\r\nworld, such as Africa, that are not represented at the level\r\nof permanent membership should be so represented. It\r\nwill, therefore, be incumbent upon those regions to agree\r\non which country or countries should represent them as\r\npermanent members.\r\nApart from dealing with the Security Council, we\r\nmust fashion the United Nations in such a way as to\r\naccord a central role to issues of the development of the\r\ndeveloping countries. The Economic and Social Council\r\nshould therefore be attuned to meeting this challenge. We\r\nwould like to see a stronger Economic and Social Council\r\nwith a mandate adequate to coordinate the policies of all\r\ndevelopment programmes and activities, as well as the\r\nactivities of the specialized agencies, including the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, for the promotion of sustained\r\neconomic growth and development.\r\nWe now live in a world in which there has been a\r\nmajor recasting of international relations ranging from\r\npolitical to economic, environmental to humanitarian\r\nissues. In this new atmosphere, the United Nations is the\r\nlinchpin of our collective security, the repository of our\r\nhope for progress and prosperity. In this atmosphere, the\r\nUnited Nations has no greater contribution to make in the\r\nservice of its ideals than to help the world find its way\r\nfrom the era of fear from which we are emerging into a\r\ntime of hope and progress for all mankind.\r\nWe wish this great creation more success for the\r\nbetterment of the entire world.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\nnext on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Trinidad and\r\nTobago, His Excellency The Honourable Ralph Maraj.\r\nMr. Maraj (Trinidad and Tobago): I should like to\r\noffer congratulations and special greetings to Ambassador\r\nEssy on his unanimous election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that under his able\r\nleadership this session of the General Assembly is well\r\nplaced to address successfully the important issues on its\r\nagenda.\r\nAllow me to express appreciation to His Excellency\r\nMr. Samuel Insanally for his wise and effective guidance\r\nduring the session just concluded. He has indeed made an\r\noutstanding contribution, of which our region is very proud.\r\nWe express our thanks to the Secretary-General for his\r\nstewardship of the Organization during these trying times,\r\nand we renew our pledge to give him our fullest support.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, like the rest of the world, is in\r\nthe process of making fundamental changes in the way we\r\nmanage our affairs. We have already advanced\r\nsignificantly along the path of deregulation and\r\nliberalization brought upon us by the inexorable move\r\ntowards globalization and borderlessness, and most\r\nimportantly by the absolute necessity to achieve greater\r\nefficiency and higher sustainable levels of productivity.\r\nGreater emphasis is being placed on the market paradigm\r\nas the means to unleash the inner energies of our society\r\nand to create the wealth needed for the improvement of the\r\nlives of all our citizens.\r\nBut let me hasten to add that we are acutely aware of\r\nthe imbalances that could arise as a result of the purest play\r\nof market forces, and we as a society consider it our\r\nresponsibility to ensure that distributive justice exists in our\r\nsystem, sufficiently to guarantee the well-being of all of our\r\ncitizens, including those who are unable to compete and\r\nwho for one reason or another may have been pushed out\r\nof the mainstream of national activity. In other words,\r\nwhilst many things may be changing, there is one constant\r\nin Trinidad and Tobago, and that is our preservation of a\r\nhumane and just society where all have the opportunity for\r\nfulfilment.\r\nSide by side with the globalization process, or maybe\r\nas a byproduct of it, is a resurgence of regionalism\r\nthroughout the world. In our own hemisphere this is very\r\npronounced, and the dream of a free trade area from Alaska\r\nto Tierra del Fuego seems more realizable than ever before.\r\nWe are pleased to see various subregional groupings\r\nemerge and then develop relationships with one another.\r\nNever before in the history of our hemisphere has the\r\nintegration process been so advanced. We have the North\r\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Southern\r\nCone Common Market (MERCOSUR), the Andean Pact,\r\nthe Central American Integration Movement, the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System (SELA), the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) and the Rio Group, in addition\r\nof course to the Organization of American States. It is\r\nsignificant that the cooperation which is flowering is not\r\nonly economic but also political; this augurs very well for\r\nthe development as well as for the security of the\r\nhemisphere.\r\nIn addition to this multilateral coalescence, there is\r\na general strengthening of bilateral relationships. We in\r\nCARICOM have been making strides towards overcoming\r\nhistorical barriers and have been deepening our ties with\r\nLatin America. My own country, having this year\r\nestablished diplomatic relations with six countries of Latin\r\nAmerica, now has diplomatic relations with all the\r\ncountries of the western hemisphere. Also, we joined 38\r\nothers, including both independent countries and\r\nnon-independent Territories, in establishing the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States, comprising countries of\r\nthe Caribbean littoral and bringing into being a market of\r\nover 200 million people with a combined gross domestic\r\nproduct of $500 billion.\r\nWe do all this for the benefit of our people, realizing\r\nthat when we join forces we are stronger, we lay the\r\nbedrock for a stable environment within the hemisphere,\r\nand we create, among other things, megamarkets for our\r\nproducts and generate the wealth through which we\r\nimprove the standard of living in our countries.\r\nI have spoken about the possibilities for political\r\nco-operation as a result of the integration processes taking\r\nplace in our region. May I mention an outstanding\r\ncurrent example. I refer of course to Haiti. At present in\r\nHaiti, sanctioned by Security Council resolution 940\r\n(1994), is a multinational force comprised mainly of\r\ntroops from the region, with military contributions from\r\nelsewhere. My Government welcomes the cooperation\r\nextended by countries outside the region whose\r\nfarsightedness persuaded them to contribute to the\r\nrestoration process now taking place in Haiti.\r\nIn the changed circumstances of today’s world, there\r\nis more than ever a need to cooperate for security\r\npurposes and for the preservation of democracy, and this\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nof course requires the political will which has been\r\ndemonstrated by our region in the Haitian situation.\r\nSoldiers from Trinidad and Tobago are part of the\r\nmultinational force at present in Haiti. We are pleased to\r\nparticipate in the collective efforts to ensure stability and\r\nthe return of democracy and the democratically elected\r\nPresident to that country. We believe that the Caribbean\r\nhas a special responsibility in relation to Haiti. We have\r\ntherefore been in the forefront of attempts to solve the\r\ncrisis, and we vow to remain with the problem until it is no\r\nmore with us.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago joins the jubilation of the\r\nmillions of proud Haitians at home and in the diaspora at\r\nthe welcome news of the resignation of General Raoul\r\nCedras and his Chief of Staff. Like others, we hope this\r\nsends an unequivocal message to those elements in Haiti\r\nthat seek to continue to wage war and terror against a\r\npeople still yearning for a society of freedom, democracy\r\nand justice - a society in which the collective talents and\r\nresourcefulness of Haitians can be appropriately channelled\r\ntowards rebuilding their nation and fighting the enemies of\r\npoverty and degradation.\r\nAnother area of Caribbean concern has to do with\r\nCuba. We welcome the commencement of dialogue\r\nbetween Cuba and the United States of America on specific\r\nissues. These talks should assist in laying a foundation for\r\nthe resolution of remaining difficulties and in achieving the\r\nlong-term objective of fully reintegrating Cuba into the\r\nWestern Hemisphere. We in the Caribbean are doing our\r\npart towards the goal of Cuba’s reintegration. We have\r\nestablished the Cuba-Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\nMixed Commission, and recently Cuba joined us as a\r\nfounding member of the Association of Caribbean States.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago also welcomes the consolidation\r\nof democracy in the Latin American and Caribbean region.\r\nPeaceful elections continue to be conducted in these\r\ncountries, deepening the democratic process in the region.\r\nWe are pleased with the many positive developments\r\nin our part of the world. There have also been positive\r\ndevelopments in former areas of conflict which seized the\r\nattention of this body for many years, further illustrating\r\nwhat can be achieved through partnership and political will.\r\nThe peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa a few\r\nmonths ago stands out as a beacon of hope and signals that\r\nno problem is insurmountable if there is concerted national\r\nand international action. Trinidad and Tobago joins with\r\nthe international community in assuring South Africa of its\r\ncontinued support in this crucial post-apartheid period. The\r\nGovernment of South Africa has announced its decision\r\nto include among its priorities the continuation of\r\ntraditional friendships and the promotion of new\r\npartnerships. We look forward to the development of\r\nstrong bilateral relations between South Africa and\r\nourselves, a process that is already under way.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is also heartened by the\r\nprogress achieved so far in the Middle East peace\r\nprocess. We welcome the initiation of self-governing\r\narrangements in the Gaza Strip and Jericho - important\r\ndevelopments in this transition period - and look forward\r\nto the extension of Palestinian self-governing\r\narrangements to encompass other occupied territories in\r\nthe implementation of the Declaration of Principles. The\r\ninternational community’s support for development efforts\r\nin the economic and social fields and the rebuilding of\r\ninfrastructure destroyed during the long years of\r\noccupation is critical to the Palestinian people at this time.\r\nWe are encouraged by the Washington Declaration\r\nof 25 July 1994, issued by the Governments of Jordan\r\nand Israel, which ended the state of war and paves the\r\nway for normalization of relations and a formal peace\r\ntreaty. We also appreciate the efforts made by the Syrian\r\nand Lebanese Governments in their commitment to\r\nadvancing the peace process in the Middle East.\r\nWhilst there is cause for satisfaction globally, we\r\ncontinue to be traumatized by other events which have\r\nalready shattered the lives of millions of people, evoking\r\nimages more horrendous than those we have witnessed\r\nbefore. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a genocidal war\r\nrages on, having already brought the evil of “ethnic\r\ncleansing” into our modern vocabulary and consciousness.\r\nWe were first appalled and are now numbed by the horror\r\nin Rwanda, where hundreds of thousands of lives have\r\nbeen lost, creating hellish human suffering in that country.\r\nDestruction, oppression and suffering continue in various\r\nparts of the world, affecting hundreds of thousands of\r\nlives in Somalia and elsewhere.\r\nNuclear proliferation makes us all very uneasy,\r\ncreating pictures of an abyss of unspeakable chaos into\r\nwhich we can very easily slip. The ideological divide\r\nmay be behind us, but the threat of Armageddon still\r\nhangs over humanity.\r\nIt has become a cliché of international helplessness\r\nto say that the world community must act decisively and\r\nexpeditiously to do this or that to deal with many of the\r\nproblems that I have mentioned. The fact is that there is\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\na very long road ahead. To effect lasting solutions to the\r\ncrises that are upon us we must go back always to the\r\nfundamentals and remember, for example, that development\r\nand peace are inextricably linked. If we are to get\r\nanywhere near to solving some of our problems we must\r\ndeal with key issues such as good governance, the\r\npromotion of peace, the promotion of justice as a pillar of\r\nsociety, sustainable environmental management and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the world\r\ncommunity is already beginning to grapple with\r\nfundamentals. We are in the process of elaborating the\r\nAgenda for Development as a necessary complement to the\r\n“Agenda for Peace”. International conferences of world\r\nleaders, some held and others to come, all point the way to\r\na new partnership for development based on global\r\nconsensus and action.\r\nIn this regard, the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment will be convened in March 1995 in Denmark\r\nto address some of the serious ills afflicting many societies\r\nby focusing on the key problems of poverty, unemployment\r\nand social marginalization. The programme of action to be\r\nadopted at the social Summit must therefore include\r\nspecific provisions, including adequate financial resources\r\nfor implementation and follow-up by the international\r\ncommunity and, more specifically, by the United Nations\r\nand its agencies and institutions.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the quality of life in many\r\ncountries today as it relates to the individual is undergoing\r\na grave transformation. The growing intolerance and\r\nincreasing senseless violence within the home and in\r\ncommunities at large have led many to question the very\r\nmores of the society in which we live. The situation is\r\nfurther aggravated by the growth of organized transnational\r\ncrime, which in many countries exacerbates problems of\r\nrampant vicious criminal activity, terrorism, drug abuse,\r\nillegal drug trafficking and money laundering.\r\nIn this era of increasing globalization, no Government,\r\nparticularly Governments in the developing world, can\r\nhope, on its own, to address effectively these varied\r\nproblems. We therefore welcome the approval by the\r\nInternational Law Commission earlier this year of a draft\r\nstatute for an international criminal court and we support\r\nthe convening of a diplomatic conference to conclude a\r\nconvention on the establishment of a permanent court.\r\nAnother important area being tackled by the\r\ninternational community is the full participation of women\r\nin the process of development. The fact is, effective\r\ninternational cooperation for development will remain\r\nelusive, in the absence of specific measures for an\r\nadequate means of empowering all members of society to\r\nparticipate fully in the political, economic and social life\r\nof their respective societies. It is widely acknowledged\r\nthat investment in women can have an enormous impact\r\non the advancement of society as a whole. However,\r\nwomen from all parts of the globe continue to face\r\nsystematic discrimination in all fields of endeavour, while\r\nalso bearing a disproportionate burden of the\r\nconsequences of economic recession, poverty, structural\r\nadjustment policies and political strife.\r\nIn acknowledging this, Trinidad and Tobago has put\r\nin place constitutional guarantees to ensure equal\r\ntreatment for all under the law, irrespective of gender,\r\ncreed or race. My Government holds steadfastly to the\r\nposition that women must be allowed equal opportunity\r\nto participate fully in all spheres of life and at all levels\r\nof society, particularly in decision-making positions.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is encouraged by efforts made\r\nduring the ongoing preparatory process for the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women to address these and other\r\ncrucial issues. Much work remains to be done in the\r\nensuing months. My Government will continue to work\r\nclosely with others in an effort to elaborate concrete\r\nrecommendations, including specific attainable goals,\r\naimed at overcoming the numerous impediments to the\r\nadvancement of women.\r\nThe population question also continues to be on the\r\ninternational agenda. It is recognized that population-\r\nrelated goals and policies must be integral parts of\r\ncultural, economic and social development aimed at\r\nimproving the quality of life. Consequently, the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nwhich was convened in Cairo last September, quite\r\nappropriately reviewed the impact of demographic factors\r\non development and emphasized the importance of the\r\nentire spectrum of population policies to the development\r\nprocess. We must now take concrete steps to uphold the\r\nprinciples and implement the Programme of Action\r\nadopted by the Conference.\r\nThe crucial area of the environment is also being\r\ndiscussed. Member States have taken initial steps at the\r\nnational and international levels, towards the elaboration\r\nof a new development paradigm based on the integration\r\nof environmental concerns in development activities. The\r\ncontinuation of this process would lead to the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nimplementation of the policies and decisions adopted at Rio\r\nde Janeiro, thereby making possible the attainment of the\r\ntargets identified for our common good.\r\nAs a follow-up to the Rio de Janeiro Conference, the\r\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States, which was held in\r\nBarbados earlier this year, allowed island States and the rest\r\nof the international community to explore a comprehensive\r\napproach to sustainable development within the framework\r\nof Agenda 21. For many island developing States which\r\nhave remained on the periphery of international\r\nprogrammes for development, the implementation of the\r\nagreements adopted in Barbados will create the opportunity\r\nto participate as contributors and beneficiaries in a truly\r\nglobal effort. As Chairman of the Alliance of Small Island\r\nStates, Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its commitment to\r\nplaying a lead role in the active pursuit of the\r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.\r\nThe preservation and sustainable management of the\r\nresources in all global commons must be an important goal\r\nof the Agenda for Development. But this goal must be\r\nfacilitated by the development of legal regimes to ensure\r\nthat we successfully carry out our duties as trustees of those\r\nresources.\r\nIn this context, Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the\r\nimminent entry into force of the 1982 United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, having participated very\r\nactively with other Member States in forging a new, more\r\nuniversally accepted public order for the oceans. The spirit\r\nof accommodation and consensus manifested in the work\r\nachieved by the Preparatory Commission for the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority and for the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea constitutes a solid and\r\nvaluable foundation for the launching of the International\r\nSeabed Authority in Kingston, Jamaica, on\r\n16 November 1994. Trinidad and Tobago will continue to\r\nparticipate constructively and in close cooperation with\r\nother Member States in the decision-making process of the\r\nAuthority as well as in other institutions related to the 1982\r\nConvention.\r\nThe coming into force of the Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea should provide an impetus to the United Nations\r\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks, which is developing principles for the effective\r\nmanagement of one of the most important renewable food\r\nresources. This objective can be attained only if there is a\r\nconfluence of political will to act decisively.\r\nPolitical will is also absolutely necessary if we are\r\nto address adequately the various international economic\r\nimpediments to effective national efforts to promote social\r\nprogress and better standards of life. The major obstacles\r\ninclude trade barriers, insufficient flows of international\r\nfinancing, onerous external debt and the inadequate\r\ntransfer of technology to developing countries. They\r\nserve to frustrate the ardent efforts made by Governments\r\nto revitalize their economies.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago welcomes the important step\r\ntaken earlier this year towards free and open trade, with\r\nthe successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade\r\nnegotiations. We emphasize, however, that as we seek to\r\nimplement the trade liberalization measures under the\r\nagreements arrived at, urgent attention must be given to\r\nthe persistent trend of economic growth accompanied by\r\nincreased poverty, unemployment and marginalization of\r\nlarge sections of populations the world over.\r\nIt is clear from what I have said that it is only\r\nthrough a multilateral approach that we will solve the\r\nproblems of the world. Clearly, the most appropriate\r\nvehicle to accommodate this approach is the United\r\nNations. People are turning increasingly to the United\r\nNations not only for the realization of their aspirations for\r\npeace and security, but also in their quest for\r\ndevelopment with equity and social justice. Following the\r\ndissipation of the distrust and hostility of the cold-war\r\nera, the United Nations ought to be in a better position to\r\nrespond to these needs.\r\nOn becoming a Member of the United Nations 32\r\nyears ago, Trinidad and Tobago undertook along with\r\nother Member States to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity and to promote the economic and social\r\nadvancement of all peoples. To this end we intend to\r\nparticipate actively in current efforts to restructure the\r\nUnited Nations to enable it to become more responsive to\r\nthe needs of Member States in this dynamic international\r\nenvironment.\r\nAs the United Nations is on the threshold of\r\ncelebrating its fiftieth anniversary, Trinidad and Tobago\r\nis pleased to recommit itself to the purposes and\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter. As Members, we\r\nneed to redouble our efforts towards forging universal\r\npeace and a new era of development, in which both\r\nnations and individuals find security and fulfilment. I am\r\nconfident that inherent in the human condition is the\r\ndesire and the will to achieve these goals.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nAddress by Mr. Mikhail Chygir, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Belarus\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime Minister\r\nof the Republic of Belarus.\r\nMr. Mikhail Chygir, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nBelarus, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Belarus, Mr. Mikhail Chygir, and inviting him\r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Chygir (Belarus) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nLet me congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his unanimous\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\nninth session. This is both a tribute to his country’s\r\ncontribution to the work of the Organization and an\r\nacknowledgement of his personal achievements in\r\nmultilateral diplomacy.\r\nAlmost half a century ago, the founding Member\r\nStates — and my country is one of them — set for the\r\nUnited Nations a task of paramount importance: to unite\r\nour strength to maintain international peace and security\r\nand to promote the economic and social development of all\r\nnations. It was necessary to create a mechanism for\r\ncoordinating states’ efforts that could offer mutually\r\nacceptable solutions to international problems. Experience\r\nhas shown that the United Nations can play the part of such\r\na unique mechanism. Thanks to the great efforts of this\r\nprestigious international Organization, we have managed to\r\navoid military flare-ups and conflicts in many parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe world has changed dramatically. The political,\r\nideological and military confrontation of two social systems\r\nhas become a thing of the past. The ice of the cold war\r\nhas melted away completely. These changes brought to the\r\nworld hopes for a better future but, unfortunately, have\r\nfailed to solve all international problems. Tragedies whose\r\nunderlying cause is ethnic, religious and national enmity are\r\nbeing played out in Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nNagorny Karabakh, Abkhazia and Tajikistan. Unsettled\r\nbilateral relations between some States, including those\r\nrelating to the areas of human rights and protection of\r\nnational minorities, are also factors. And there is also\r\nterrorism, drug-trafficking and uncontrolled arms exports,\r\nincluding arms supplies into areas of conflict and hot spots\r\nin countries where bloodshed continues.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the role of the United\r\nNations as a universally recognized uniter of peoples\r\nbecomes much more significant. I am deeply convinced\r\nthat there will come a time when the collective reason of\r\nthe United Nations will have a much greater impact on\r\nthe processes taking place in the world. Our duty is to do\r\neverything we can to achieve that. Here in the United\r\nNations, we have to find the answers to many questions\r\nof concern to our countries.\r\nFor Belarus, this is especially important. For four\r\nyears now Belarus has been building a democratic,\r\nindependent and sovereign State. Our ideal is one of a\r\nfree citizen in a free country. After decades of\r\ntotalitarianism and sham collectivism, we are gradually\r\ngiving back to our people freedom, which the great\r\nhumanist Leonardo da Vinci called the main gift of\r\nnature.\r\nOne significant milestone in the life of Belarus was\r\nthe adoption of a new Constitution and — a historic first\r\nfor us — truly free and democratic presidential elections.\r\nHenceforth Belarus has a President elected by the people,\r\nAlaksandr Lukashenka, who has testified to his basic\r\ncommitment to progressive market reforms. Presidential\r\npower and the trust of the people guarantee that\r\ndemocratic reforms in our country will be irreversible.\r\nAnd today we also have regular elections to the Belarus\r\nParliament and for local authorities.\r\nIn foreign policy, the Republic of Belarus believes\r\nin the principles of sovereign equality of states, non-use\r\nof force or the threat of force, inviolability of borders,\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, non-interference in\r\ninternal affairs and other universally recognized norms of\r\ninternational law. Our Constitution contains a provision\r\nthat Belarus should be a neutral State and its territory a\r\nnuclear-free zone. Our Republic is ready to cooperate\r\nwith the whole world and is seeking its rightful place in\r\nEurope in the regional structures of collective security and\r\neconomic cooperation.\r\nThe President and the Government of the Republic\r\nof Belarus believe that implementation of market reforms\r\nwill guarantee success in the democratic transformations\r\nin our society. We have embarked on this path firmly\r\nand irreversibly. The legal and organizational bases for\r\nmoving to the socially oriented market economy have\r\nnow been created in the Republic. Appropriate legislation\r\nhas been enacted. The ideas of having a state of law,\r\ndividing power into different branches and improving the\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nsystem of executive authority are now being put into\r\npractice.\r\nHowever, as in other countries of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope, transition to a market economy is very difficult.\r\nOur greatest difficulties occur in privatization, fighting\r\nmonopolies and stabilizing the monetary-financial system.\r\nMoreover, we inherited from the past a national economic\r\nstructure in which an excessively large share was given to\r\nthe military-industrial complex. Internal and external\r\nnational debt is also high, leading to budget deficits and\r\ninflation.\r\nThe situation is aggravated by the long-term\r\nconsequences of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear\r\npower plant. The adverse effect of the unprecedented\r\nradioactive contamination on people’s health is not\r\ndecreasing. On the contrary, it increases as this tragic day\r\nrecedes. On top of all of this, we had a drought this year\r\nthe likes of which our country had not seen for at least 100\r\nyears. Modest estimates put the overall damage from the\r\ndrought at more than $300 million.\r\nUnder these difficult circumstances, the Republic has\r\nelaborated a programme of measures for pulling the\r\neconomy out of crisis. This programme will be the basis\r\nfor an agreement with the International Monetary Fund,\r\nwhich we plan to sign sometime next month. Firmly\r\nresolved to carry out wide-scale reforms, we intend to curb\r\ninflation, reduce the budget deficit and reduce the deficit in\r\nthe balance of payments. Full liberalization of trade and\r\nprices, speeding up privatization, should, we think, make it\r\npossible to lessen the crisis in our economy. Relying on\r\nour own forces, we nevertheless understand that without\r\nsupport from the outside we cannot carry out our reforms\r\nfully and in a reasonably short time.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus does not intend to withdraw\r\ninto its own problems. We are open to the concerns,\r\nanxieties and problems of the whole world, and we wish to\r\nmake our own contribution to the activities of the world\r\ncommunity of nations. Not just rhetorically, but in reality,\r\nBelarus was the first State in history voluntarily, without\r\nreservations or conditions, to renounce the possession of\r\nnuclear weapons. We support proposals on the indefinite\r\nand unconditional extension of the Nuclear\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty.\r\nIn 1990, from this rostrum, the delegation of the\r\nRepublic of Belarus put forward the idea of establishing a\r\nnuclear-free belt from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Recent\r\nsteps taken by Belarus to withdraw nuclear weapons from\r\nits territory ahead of schedule make it possible to consider\r\na substantial part of this region as nuclear-free territory\r\nalready.\r\nBelarus supports the efforts by Members of the\r\nUnited Nations to speed up the negotiations on concluding\r\na comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. We believe such\r\na treaty could be signed as early as next year. We also\r\nsupport the proposal made here to elaborate a treaty on\r\nnuclear security and strategic stability. And, of course,\r\nwe advocate multilateral discussion of issues relating to\r\nregulating the international arms market and military\r\nequipment.\r\nI would like to stress that, despite our economic\r\ncrisis, our Republic is endeavouring to comply fully with\r\nour obligations to reduce nuclear and conventional\r\nweapons, even though this requires enormous additional\r\nexpenditures. In this connection, we feel we can expect\r\nthe international community to support our actions.\r\nThe noble quest of peoples for peace following the\r\nSecond World War led to the establishment of the United\r\nNations. The people of Belarus paid a great price in\r\ndelivering of world from fascism. The deadly fires of\r\nwar scorched our land and touched literally every family\r\nin it. The tragic price of freedom was the life of every\r\nfourth citizen in my country. Not until 25 years after the\r\nwar did our population once again attain its pre-war level.\r\nThus, the General Assembly’s decision to make 1995 the\r\nUnited Nations year of tolerance and to proclaim it the\r\nworld year of commemoration of victims of the Second\r\nWorld War evokes a particularly profound response in\r\nBelarus. The Belarus delegation also considers that next\r\nyear would be the appropriate time to delete from the\r\nUnited Nations Charter the outdated concept of the\r\n“enemy State”.\r\nWe must use the forthcoming United Nations golden\r\njubilee to seek new ways of improving our performance\r\nin the changed world conditions. It is a truism that nature\r\ncannot tolerate rigidity and that everything in nature is\r\nconstantly changing. That law is certainly applicable to\r\nthe United Nations. If the Organization is to work\r\neffectively, its major organs must undergo profound\r\nreform.\r\nIn the application of the principle of representation\r\nof countries and regions in the Security Council, the\r\ninterests of all groups of States, including the Eastern\r\nEuropean Group, must be taken more fully into account.\r\nOf course, no Security Council reform should detract\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nfrom its role as the body responsible for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, so needed by all Member\r\nStates, and particularly the smaller States.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Belarus has\r\nreacted positively to the proposal to increase the number of\r\npermanent members of the Security Council with the\r\naddition of members selected from among the countries that\r\nmake an exceptional contribution to achieving the purposes\r\nof the United Nations Charter.\r\nWe believe that greater account should be taken of\r\nexisting realities, including the complex problems\r\nconfronting countries whose economies are in transition and\r\nthe poorest countries, as well as of global problems of\r\npopulation, unemployment and environmental deterioration\r\nin all parts of the world.\r\nPolitical and economic dialogue between donor and\r\nrecipient countries must be given new content, going\r\nbeyond the traditional framework of relations between\r\nthem.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus hopes that the movement that\r\nbegan in the Philippines at the International Conference of\r\nNew or Restored Democracies and developed further at\r\nManagua will make it possible for countries in transition\r\nand developing countries to unite and to develop a\r\ncoordinated approach within the framework of the United\r\nNations to consolidate democracy and create a free market.\r\nCountries with economies in transition find themselves\r\nat different stages on their road to democracy and a market\r\neconomy, and for that reason the success of reforms\r\ndepends to a large extent on support from the international\r\ncommunity. Hence, the Belarus delegation would propose\r\nthat in 1996, under the auspices of the United Nations, an\r\ninternational conference on sustainable development in\r\ncountries with economies in transition should be held. Co-\r\norganizers of the conference might include the United\r\nNations Economic Commission for Europe, the European\r\nRegional Bureau of the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment, the European Bank for Reconstruction and\r\nDevelopment and other interested institutions.\r\nWe also believe that the granting of most-favoured-\r\nnation status, giving countries with economies in transition\r\nbroad access to international markets and integrating them\r\nfully into the world economy, would be in the interests of\r\nthe international community as a whole.\r\nThere is a growing need to broaden cooperation and\r\nstrengthen coordination between the United Nations, the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and other\r\nregional organizations and arrangements. In this\r\nconnection we welcome the granting of observer status in\r\nthe General Assembly to the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States. Belarus advocates a clearer definition\r\nof areas of cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe CIS. Such cooperation could include joint efforts in\r\npeacemaking, disarmament, the environment, anti-\r\nterrorism, drug control and industrial conversion.\r\nWe believe that peace-keeping operations should not\r\nbe allowed to overshadow the crucial problems of socio-\r\neconomic development. Administrative and financial\r\nreform must become the most important aspect of United\r\nNations renewal. One way of achieving that would be\r\nthrough a more rational distribution of the financial\r\nburden between the United Nations and other international\r\ninstitutions, including regional organizations. Another\r\nway would be to reject existing approaches to calculating\r\nthe scale of assessments of Member States for the regular\r\nbudget of the United Nations and for peace-keeping\r\noperations. It would be fairer to assess the contributions\r\nof States primarily in light of their actual capacity to pay.\r\nIn conclusion, may I say that the general debate at\r\nthis session attests to the genuine interest of Member\r\nStates in achieving the full realization of the United\r\nNations potential as a truly effective international\r\norganization, as a centre for harmonizing and coordinating\r\nthe activities of the nations of the world. The Republic\r\nof Belarus fully shares that commitment and is ready to\r\ncooperate with all countries of the world community to\r\nachieve that goal, so that the end of this century may go\r\ndown in history as the time when the aspirations and\r\nhopes of all mankind were finally met.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I thank the Prime Minister\r\nof the Republic of Belarus for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Mikhail Chygir, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nBelarus was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
