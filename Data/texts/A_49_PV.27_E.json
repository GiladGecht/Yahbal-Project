(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call on\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, Her Excellency\r\nMs. Lena Hjelm-Wallén.\r\nMs. Hjelm-Wallén (Sweden): May I at the outset\r\nexpress my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the important post of President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session.\r\nThe loss of the ferry Estonia in the Baltic Sea, where\r\nmore than 900 people perished, brought disaster close to\r\nour shores. The shock still lingers in the hearts and minds\r\nof all people around the Baltic. I am certain that this tragic\r\nevent will in the end bring the stricken peoples even closer\r\ntogether. Let me convey our sincere gratitude for the\r\nsympathy and condolences that have been expressed in this\r\nAssembly.\r\nSweden’s commitment to the United Nations and its\r\nprinciples and ideals is longstanding, firm and deep. To the\r\nnew Swedish Government this commitment is crucial. The\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations is\r\napproaching. It is perhaps the most important political\r\ndocument in the hands of humanity today. Its strength and\r\npotential are immense and must be brought to fruition.\r\nIn the spirit of the Charter, world leaders should\r\nmobilize a global civic spirit of solidarity to extend the\r\nscope of and respect for international law and to\r\nstrengthen global governance. The United Nations gives\r\nus an international system of law to avoid anarchy and\r\nthe rule of the strongest. The United Nations enables us\r\nto work together to thwart ruthless assertion of\r\nself-interest and spheres of influence.\r\nSweden wants a United Nations which reacts\r\neffectively against atrocities and mitigates human\r\nsuffering and through which we can tackle the major\r\nquestions of global survival, together and in solidarity.\r\nSweden wants a United Nations that not only is a forum\r\nfor the interests of States but that places the well-being of\r\nthe individual at the centre. Solidarity does not recognize\r\nborders. Let me quote from the statement of the\r\nPresident of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, in this\r\nAssembly a week ago:\r\n\"The millions across our globe who stand expectant\r\nat the gates of hope look to this Organization to\r\nbring them peace, to bring them life, to bring them\r\na life worth living.\" (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 14th meeting, p. 10)\r\nThese expectations and hopes are threatened by war\r\nand violence, by the suppression of human rights, and by\r\nracism and xenophobia. They are threatened by\r\nstarvation, poverty, disasters and environmental\r\ndegradation. Peace and security, democracy, human\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nrights and sustainable economic and social development\r\nconstitute a cohesive entity. If we neglect any of these\r\nvalues, we endanger the others.\r\nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania are here among us in\r\nthis Assembly as democratic and sovereign countries from\r\nwhich Russian troops have at long last been withdrawn.\r\nDiplomatic breakthroughs in the Middle East offer hopes\r\nfor a comprehensive and lasting peace. In El Salvador the\r\nUnited Nations has made a significant contribution to\r\nending the civil war. In South Africa, the apartheid has\r\nbeen dismantled.\r\nYet we are confronted with new conflicts and dangers.\r\nWe must all learn from tragic events such as those in\r\nRwanda and Somalia. The inconceivable suffering in\r\nRwanda points to the need for preventive diplomacy, early\r\naction and the coordination of United Nations efforts. In\r\nSomalia, the break-up of organized society and the ensuing\r\nlarge-scale violence and starvation underline the need for\r\nthe careful coordination of peace-keeping, peacemaking and\r\npeace-building endeavours.\r\nWhile taking a forceful attitude to gain respect, the\r\nUnited Nations should avoid military enforcement other\r\nthan as a very last resort and with a clear Security Council\r\nmandate.\r\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina and in other parts of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, efforts to end the conflict must be\r\nintensified and accepted by all parties. Pressure on Bosnian\r\nSerbs has to be further increased. Only in peace can the\r\ntragic consequences of \"ethnic cleansing\" be reversed.\r\nNow is the time to work out plans for reconstruction and\r\nreconciliation.\r\nThe Swedish Government is concerned about\r\ninformation on Iraqi military activity close to the border\r\nwith Kuwait. We fully support the statement on the\r\nsituation made by the Security Council three days ago.\r\nIn facing the challenges of the post-cold-war\r\ninternational system, Member States must give their full\r\nsupport to the United Nations, but they must also actively\r\npromote necessary reforms of the Organization. The\r\nCommission on Global Governance, headed by the Swedish\r\nPrime Minister and by Mr. Ramphal, will present proposals\r\nfor reform early next year.\r\nLet me mention a few areas where, in my view,\r\nreform is urgently needed.\r\nThe United Nations must be able to operate more\r\nefficiently and according to modern principles of\r\nmanagement, and new priorities have to be set.\r\nWe need an enlarged and more effective Security\r\nCouncil, one that is both legitimate and representative.\r\nThere is a need for increased transparency in the work of\r\nthe Council. Countries in all regions must feel that they\r\nare partners in its actions. The Council has to maintain\r\npolitical control over the actions it authorizes. It must not\r\nbecome an instrument for dividing the world into spheres\r\nof interest, one in which the collective nature of United\r\nNations action is not sufficiently safeguarded.\r\nSweden has drawn experience from its participation\r\nin the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).\r\nSubstantive consultations between troop contributors, the\r\nSecretariat and Security Council members on a formal\r\nand regular basis are necessary.\r\nThere must be a particular focus on early warning\r\nand early action in conflict resolution. Preventive\r\ndiplomacy should be further strengthened. Thousands of\r\nlives can be saved and costly relief efforts avoided if\r\naction is taken in time.\r\nThe new Swedish Government is ready to establish\r\na United Nations peace-keeping brigade. We do this in\r\nresponse to the Secretary-General’s proposal for stand-by\r\nforces set up by Member States, ready to be deployed in\r\ncrisis areas without delay.\r\nThe need for better and more uniform training of\r\npeace-keepers is urgent. Particular attention should be\r\npaid to improved coordination between the military\r\naspects of peace-keeping and civilian and humanitarian\r\nefforts. With this in mind, Sweden is prepared to\r\ncontribute to improved training of peace-keepers.\r\nSweden would like to see closer interaction between\r\nhumanitarian programmes and peace-keeping operations.\r\nThere is great potential for humanitarian action as a tool\r\nof preventive diplomacy, as well as for promoting a\r\npolitical climate that can facilitate the peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes at an early stage.\r\nThe reluctance of Member States to pay their dues\r\nin full and on time is frustrating and must cease\r\nimmediately. When this lack of discipline affects the\r\nfinancing of peace-keeping operations, it puts an\r\nadditional burden on the troop contributors.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nSweden welcomes measures by the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs to coordinate the activities of\r\nhumanitarian agencies and many non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nHuman rights is another area of priority for the\r\nSwedish Government. Fortunately, there is a growing and\r\nwidening awareness among Member States of the role of\r\nhuman rights and democracy for the development of\r\nmodern societies. Binding norms protecting human rights\r\nexist, yet violations continue. This is unacceptable.\r\nGovernments must show the will and commitment to fully\r\nimplement human rights norms.\r\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child was a great\r\nachievement. It is indeed a great challenge to assure all\r\nchildren of care, protection, education and freedom from\r\nhunger and from physical or mental violence, as provided\r\nfor in the Convention and reaffirmed at the World Summit\r\nfor Children. Governments which have ratified the\r\nConvention must live up to their commitments to the\r\nchildren of the world.\r\nSolidarity is fundamental in our efforts to overcome\r\nglobal economic and social challenges, and, thus,\r\nfundamental to prospects for peace and solidarity. The\r\nUnited Nations has a unique and central role in this\r\nendeavour.\r\nSweden’s development cooperation will focus on\r\nsupport for the long-term, sustainable development of poor\r\ncountries, with special emphasis on democracy, popular\r\nparticipation and the rights of women and children.\r\nSweden will continue to allocate a substantial amount\r\nof its assistance to operational activities in the United\r\nNations. We will also continue our efforts to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations function as a forum for normative\r\ndiscussion and action and as a channel for development\r\ncooperation. The quality and effectiveness of United\r\nNations activities in the economic and social field have to\r\nbe improved, while at the same a stable and predictable\r\nflow of resources is secured.\r\nPriorities and the allocation of responsibilities within\r\nthe international community need to be discussed further.\r\n\"An Agenda for Development\" (A/48/935) is a key\r\ninstrument in this endeavour. We must use it to draw up\r\na clear and strategic programme of action for the United\r\nNations system in the development area.\r\nThe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment in Cairo, the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment to be held in Copenhagen, and the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women in Beijing are all linked.\r\nThey contribute to the achievement of human security in\r\na broader sense.\r\nThe Cairo Conference established that questions of\r\npopulation and development must be treated together.\r\nThe starting-point must be the human being and the rights\r\nand security of the individual.\r\nAgenda 21, adopted at the Rio Conference,\r\nfacilitates joint action to achieve sustainable development\r\nat both the local and the global level. All over Sweden\r\nlocal versions of Agenda 21 are now being actively\r\npursued.\r\nIt is imperative to stop wasting resources and\r\nthereby depriving future generations of their means of\r\nlivelihood. Patterns of consumption and production must\r\nbe sustainable. In this regard, the developed countries\r\nhave a particular responsibility. Ecological balance must\r\nbe established also while we combat poverty.\r\nDisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons\r\nof mass destruction are central to the goals of preventing\r\nconflicts, promoting peace and fostering economic and\r\nsocial development. In recent years important progress\r\nhas been made. Agreements that were inconceivable only\r\na few years ago have been concluded. But signatures are\r\nnot enough. Agreements must also be ratified and\r\nimplemented if they are to contribute to peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nFurthermore, the present momentum should be used\r\nto strengthen and further develop well-established\r\ndisarmament regimes. The need to establish a verification\r\nsystem for the Convention on biological weapons is a\r\ncase in point.\r\nThe non-proliferation Treaty is a key to both nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. The Treaty is the\r\nonly multilateral agreement in which nuclear-weapon\r\nStates have committed themselves to nuclear\r\ndisarmament. As long as nuclear weapons exist, we must\r\ninsist that these commitments be honoured. It is not least\r\nwith this in mind that the extension of the Treaty should\r\nbe pursued. Our common goal must be a world free of\r\nnuclear arms.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nOn several occasions, Sweden has presented proposals\r\nfor a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We are gratified that\r\nall States, including the nuclear-weapon States, are now\r\nprepared to negotiate such a treaty. It is essential that these\r\nnegotiations be concluded in the very near future.\r\nSweden was one of the first countries to ratify the\r\nchemical weapons Convention. So far, almost 160 States\r\nhave signed the Convention, but only 16 have ratified it.\r\nWe urge all States to take the necessary steps for\r\nratification, so that the Convention can enter into force\r\nwithout delay.\r\nSome 100 million land-mines all over the world\r\nrepresent both an acute and an impending humanitarian\r\ndisaster as well as a threat to economic development, even\r\nyears and decades after hostilities have ceased. The\r\nlong-term solution is an international agreement to ban\r\nanti-personnel land-mines. Sweden has proposed such a\r\nban.\r\nRegional instruments for preventing and dealing with\r\nconflicts are being developed. This should not deprive the\r\nregions involved of support from the international\r\ncommunity through the United Nations. The responsibility\r\nof the United Nations, including the Security Council,\r\nremains universal.\r\nThe Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE) is a central and indispensable institution for\r\nconflict prevention and management. The endeavours of\r\nthe CSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities have\r\neffectively contributed to building security in Europe, as\r\nhave the CSCE missions in the field.\r\nThe Swedish experience of cooperation between the\r\nCSCE and the United Nations tells us that global and\r\nregional efforts are not in contradiction but are mutually\r\nreinforcing.\r\nSweden’s non-participation in military alliances\r\nremains unchanged. This policy contributes to the\r\nmaintenance of stability in the north of Europe, and\r\nimproves our possibilities of working for common security\r\nin Europe and in the world at large.\r\nSweden will actively contribute to the new security\r\npartnership in Europe by responding rapidly to requests\r\nfrom the United Nations, and by contributing substantially\r\nto activities of the Council of Europe, the CSCE and the\r\nPartnership for Peace arrangement. We want to strengthen\r\ncooperation with all our neighbours around the Baltic Sea\r\nand in the Barents Sea region. We look forward to\r\ncooperation in all areas with the new, democratic Russia.\r\nSweden has applied for membership in the European\r\nUnion. In one month the people of Sweden will decide\r\non this important question in a referendum. As a member\r\nof the Union, Sweden would whole-heartedly support the\r\nUnion’s efforts to promote security and economic and\r\nsocial development, not only in Europe but on a global\r\nscale. It is by looking outwards, by forging links and\r\nextending its cooperation to other regions, that the\r\nEuropean Union makes its contribution to global stability\r\nand solidarity. Let me emphasize that there is no\r\ncontradiction between European and global cooperation.\r\nSweden will be an active member of the United Nations\r\nand defend openness and international cooperation.\r\nSweden has presented its candidature for a seat on\r\nthe Security Council for the period 1997 to 1998. The\r\nSwedish candidature is based on our commitment to\r\nglobal security, on our will to promote international law,\r\nand on our conviction that conflicts can and must be\r\nsolved by addressing their root causes before they lead to\r\nwar.\r\nSweden’s support for the United Nations is a\r\nfundamental national interest and a cornerstone in our\r\nforeign policy, for reasons of peace, freedom, security,\r\ndemocracy and justice. For these reasons, Sweden will\r\nstrongly promote the United Nations — a United Nations\r\nbased on democratic principles, giving us all a voice in\r\nour common future.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ntsu Mokhehle, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Lesotho\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Lesotho.\r\nMr. Ntsu Mokhehle, Prime Minister of the Kingdom\r\nof Lesotho, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Lesotho, His Excellency the Right\r\nHonourable Mr. Ntsu Mokhehle, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Mokhehle (Lesotho): On behalf of the people\r\nand Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, and on my\r\nown behalf, I have the pleasure to extend to you, Sir, our\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nwarmest congratulations on your well-deserved election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-ninth\r\nsession. Your election is a fitting tribute to the efforts that\r\nyour country has made and continues to make in\r\ninternational relations, especially its mediatory role in\r\nconflict situations on our continent. Our special thanks also\r\ngo to your predecessor, the Ambassador of the Republic of\r\nGuyana, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, whose\r\nabilities and clear vision in steering the Assembly during\r\nthe forty-eighth session will forever be remembered with\r\nappreciation.\r\nWe are also indebted to our distinguished\r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, whose track record is without parallel.\r\nMy delegation is proud to welcome the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa, now free and democratic, back into the\r\ninternational fold. The resumption of the right of South\r\nAfrica, a founding Member of the United Nations, to\r\nparticipate in the deliberations of the General Assembly and\r\nother organs of the United Nations, is very timely, coming\r\nas it does as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations.\r\nEven as we approach the threshold of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, our world is still mired in conflicts. Our\r\nOrganization must strive to contain these and other\r\nsituations, which are the legacy of the post-cold-war era.\r\nWe are entering a new era, one in which democratic and\r\ninclusive global institutions can play a principal role in\r\nbuilding a better world. It is still difficult, however, to\r\nhave a clear vision of the future role of the United Nations\r\nin the new international political order that is emerging\r\nfollowing the end of the cold war.\r\nAs it approaches its fiftieth anniversary, the United\r\nNations faces a number of challenges; it has to become a\r\nreal instrument of international legality, peace and security.\r\nThe Organization needs to have the means and the\r\nflexibility to play an increasingly active role in these\r\nunpredictable times. Unfortunately, however, the United\r\nNations of today still reflects the structure of the world of\r\n1945 as seen by the victors of the Second World War.\r\nUnited Nations organs such as the Security Council need to\r\nbe revitalized and democratized so that they may become\r\nmore representative of the regions encompassed in this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe General Assembly, as one of the principal organs\r\nof the United Nations, an organ that is universal in\r\ncharacter and one in which Member States enjoy sovereign\r\nequality, needs revitalization as part of the current process\r\nof the transformation and reform of the United Nations\r\nsystem. The United Nations system should be able, at all\r\ntimes, to respond rapidly to changes and new\r\ndevelopments as they occur around the world. In the last\r\nfew years we have witnessed significant events of historic\r\nmoment. We had not anticipated that the Iron Curtain\r\nwould be dismantled so quickly; nor could we have\r\nforeseen the demolition of the Berlin Wall and the\r\neradication of apartheid in South Africa. The United\r\nNations may not possess the clairvoyance to predict\r\nevents before they occur, but it should have the capacity\r\nto respond to developments and crises rapidly and\r\neffectively as they arise. The events in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and, recently, in Rwanda starkly demonstrate\r\nthe sluggishness of the decision-making process and the\r\nlack of responsiveness on the part of the system.\r\nDisarmament, especially in the nuclear field, remains\r\nan urgent concern of this Organization. Its relationship to\r\ninternational peace and security is today more evident\r\nthan ever before. We are mindful of the fact that in\r\nrecent years, at the height of the cold war, the world\r\nexperienced a period of uncertain peace, a peace that was\r\nsustained more by the fear of a nuclear holocaust than by\r\nthe existence of harmonious relationships among nations,\r\nespecially the opposing nuclear blocs, or by progress\r\ntowards complete and general disarmament. Today,\r\nconditions exist for the establishment of a stable and\r\npeaceful global environment. It is under such conditions\r\nthat the world can begin to enjoy what may be called the\r\npeace dividend, whereby global expenditures will be\r\nshifted away from preparations for war and unending\r\nconcern for national security towards investment in\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSolid groundwork for cooperation and\r\nconfidence-building has been successfully laid in a\r\nnumber of regions. The progress in this regard bodes\r\nwell for the future. In our region, the continental\r\norganization, the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nhas established a mechanism for the prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts. The apparent\r\ninability of the world community to act in a timely and\r\ndecisive manner during some tragic conflict situations in\r\nour continent has taught Africa the cardinal lesson that we\r\ncannot continue to delegate our responsibilities to the rest\r\nof the world. We have seen evidence of this a number of\r\ntimes, particularly during crisis situations in Rwanda and\r\nSomalia. Africa is taking up more seriously the challenge\r\nof fending for itself. We shall, however, continue to\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\ncount on international solidarity and cooperation during the\r\ntrial stages of the mechanism.\r\nIn Liberia, the OAU, in conjunction with the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nand the United Nations, continues to seek a solution to the\r\nconflict on the basis of the implementation of the Cotonou\r\nPeace Agreement. We are happy with the progress\r\nachieved thus far in Mozambique. The situation in Angola,\r\nhowever, continues to be of grave concern to us.\r\nWe urge the parties involved to show political will and\r\nto negotiate in good faith in order to ensure the early\r\nestablishment of lasting peace, stability and development.\r\nThe complementarity between democracy and the\r\nobservance of human rights on the one hand, and\r\ndevelopment on the other, can no longer be a subject of\r\ndebate. Democracy is the cornerstone of every civil society\r\nand the preservation and sustaining of its institutions should\r\nbe binding on all of us. The expression by the international\r\ncommunity of the will to cooperate in this endeavour has\r\nbeen clear in recent times. If it is necessary to look\r\nbackward to yesterday, it is only to draw lessons that will\r\nenable us to march confidently and resolutely into the\r\nfuture, a future in which our citizens will live in harmony\r\nand enjoy prosperity.\r\nThe attainment of democracy, peace and development\r\nas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the\r\ncharters of the Organization of African Unity and other\r\norganizations has become the responsibility of all nations.\r\nWhere these principles are threatened by those who are\r\nreluctant to come to terms with the realities of today, the\r\ninternational community has stood up resolutely in defence\r\nof our fledgling democracies. This attitude augurs well for\r\nthe new world order we seek to establish.\r\nThe events in Haiti and our recent experience in\r\nLesotho demonstrate beyond the shadow of a doubt that\r\nyoung and fledgling democracies can be seriously\r\nthreatened or turned off their course. In the early morning\r\nof 17 August this year, the people of Lesotho woke up to\r\nhear an announcement over Radio Lesotho that shocked and\r\nbewildered them. According to that announcement, certain\r\nclauses of the Constitution of Lesotho had been suspended,\r\nand as a result of that illegal and arbitrary act the\r\ndemocratically-elected parliament and Government of\r\nLesotho had, it was said, been dissolved. The constitutional\r\ncrisis we faced has since been resolved; however, I recall\r\nthese events because of the important lesson they brought\r\nhome to all of us who were directly concerned.\r\nFirst, it became abundantly clear that the support for\r\ndemocracy among our people cuts straight across party\r\npolitical lines. Secondly, the international community can\r\nno longer countenance an open attack upon democratic\r\nprinciples and the institutions of democratic governance.\r\nThe people of Lesotho rose up in large numbers to\r\ndemonstrate their displeasure and their abhorrence of the\r\ndisguised coup against their elected Government. Despite\r\nthe repressive measures taken by those who had brazenly\r\nintruded upon the constitutional order of our country, the\r\npeople sent a clear signal that the powers of a tyrant are\r\nforever circumscribed by the will and the determination\r\nof the people to resist oppression and by their desire to be\r\ngoverned only with their own consent.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank the United Nations,\r\nthe Organization of African Unity and the commonwealth\r\nof nations for supporting my Government and my people\r\nin their struggle to maintain legality, constitutionality and\r\ndemocratic rule in Lesotho. I need to mention\r\nspecifically the timely and principled intervention by\r\nPresident Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Nelson\r\nMandela of South Africa and President Ketumile Masire\r\nof Botswana. It is through their mediatory efforts that we\r\nwere able to emerge from the unfortunate constitutional\r\ncrisis that we experienced.\r\nThe people of Lesotho will always remember that\r\nwhen they faced a critical test, when the foundations of\r\ntheir young democracy were under attack and threatened\r\nwith wanton destruction, the friends of democracy stood\r\nfirm and remained resolute to the end. The member\r\nStates of the European Union and the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) never wavered in their\r\nsupport for democracy in Lesotho. The Governments of\r\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan,\r\nthe Federal Republic of Germany and Sweden took a\r\nstand and immediately suspended all economic assistance\r\nto Lesotho, thus sending a clear signal to the usurpers of\r\npower that what is really here to stay is democracy, and\r\nnothing else.\r\nWe in Lesotho believe that the observance of human\r\nrights would go a long way towards eliminating hotbeds\r\nof tension and civil strife. In almost every country\r\nexperiencing some kind of civil strife, it will always be\r\nfound that the first casualty of that strife is human rights.\r\nIt is in this context that, recently, Lesotho ratified\r\nquite a number of international human rights instruments.\r\nAt the regional level, we all support the work of SADC,\r\nwhich has recently decided to establish a sector to deal\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nwith human rights questions. We pledge to work with our\r\nfellow SADC member States as we develop this new sector\r\nof our organization. We also pledge to fulfil our\r\nobligations at the international level through the various\r\nUnited Nations bodies engaged in human rights work.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Lesotho for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Ntsu Mokhehle, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nLesotho, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Nathan Shamuyarira.\r\nMr. Shamuyarira (Zimbabwe): My delegation\r\ncongratulates you personally, Sir, as well as your country,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session. Your election is\r\ntestimony to the role you and your country have played in\r\ninternational relations. We are confident that the United\r\nNations will benefit from the term of your presidency.\r\nAllow me also to congratulate your predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, on his\r\noutstanding stewardship of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-eighth session. His conduct of the many complex and\r\nvital issues before that session was indeed praiseworthy.\r\nOur tribute also goes to our Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, for his sterling leadership of our\r\nOrganization during the past year, a year in which it has\r\ncontinued to face ever-increasing challenges. We are\r\nespecially grateful to him for his continued efforts to\r\nfurther the objectives of the United Nations in Africa and\r\nelsewhere, and for his tireless drive to enhance the\r\nOrganization’s role in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity and addressing development issues.\r\nMy delegation would like, at the outset, to welcome\r\nthe delegation of South Africa in our midst. Its\r\nreadmission into the community of nations signifies victory\r\nin its long and difficult struggle for justice and equality.\r\nFor the African continent, it marks the closing chapter in\r\nthe total decolonization of the continent; and for the United\r\nNations, it concludes an extraordinary collective struggle\r\nagainst the policy of apartheid.\r\nIn this context, I must add that the recent decision by\r\nthe General Conference of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency to redesignate South Africa as Africa’s\r\nrepresentative on the Agency’s board was indeed\r\nappropriate and welcome.\r\nHowever, in welcoming South Africa back to our\r\ninternational Organization, we should also heed the words\r\nof President Nelson Mandela - uttered from this rostrum\r\nonly a week ago - that his country needs massive\r\nfinancial and material aid to cope with the problem of the\r\nmillions of poor and unemployed people in his country.\r\nWhile the triumph of democratic forces in South\r\nAfrica is cause for celebration, the tragic situation in\r\nAngola continues to be a source of major concern to my\r\ndelegation. We are gravely concerned at the continued\r\nconflict in that country. If the peace accord negotiated in\r\nLusaka is not signed by the end of October, the Security\r\nCouncil should immediately impose economic sanctions\r\non UNITA, as agreed in resolution 864 (1993). We\r\ncannot continue delaying and postponing action while\r\nwaiting for a peace that does not come. However, if the\r\npeace accord is signed, the United Nations, for its part,\r\nshould stand ready to deploy a greatly increased\r\npeace-keeping force to supervise the cease-fire.\r\nIn Mozambique, despite delays in the\r\nimplementation of the General Peace Agreement, we are\r\nhopeful that peace and stability will soon be realized.\r\nThe forthcoming national elections, planned for 27 and 28\r\nOctober, should produce results acceptable to all\r\nMozambicans so that they can live in peace and harmony.\r\nThe international community and the United Nations\r\nshould continue to provide the material assistance that is\r\nneeded to realize that peace in Mozambique.\r\nMembers are aware of the crisis situation that had\r\nbeen developing in the Kingdom of Lesotho since the\r\nbeginning of the year, which culminated in the attempted\r\nunseating of the democratically elected Government. We\r\nhave just heard a statement by the Prime Minister of\r\nLesotho himself, Mr. Mokhehle, describing to us the\r\nevents that took place in his country. Consistent with the\r\nOrganization of African Unity mechanism for the\r\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts, the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC)\r\ncharged Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe with\r\nundertaking a regional initiative to resolve the crisis in\r\nLesotho.\r\nMr. Blandino Canto (Dominican Republic),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nWe are happy to report that this joint mediation has\r\nresulted in the restoration of constitutionality and\r\nconstitutional Government in that country. Prime Minister\r\nMokhehle has adequately described that situation, and I\r\nneed add nothing more.\r\nIn Rwanda, the horrendous acts of genocide we have\r\nwitnessed will surely haunt every one of us for a long time\r\nto come, both those among us who had the means to act\r\nbut did not do so and the many who, while desiring to help,\r\nlacked the means. We call for the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations presence under the United Nations\r\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), as an essential\r\nconfidence-building measure to provide the displaced\r\npeople of Rwanda with tangible assurances that they can\r\nsafely return to their homes. A few days ago we heard a\r\nstatement by the President of Rwanda, Mr. Pasteur\r\nBizimungu, inviting an increase in the size of UNAMIR in\r\norder to achieve precisely what we are asking for:\r\nconfidence-building.\r\nIn both Rwanda and Burundi, the tensions are still too\r\nclose to the surface for anyone’s comfort. In Somalia, the\r\ndeterioration of the security situation and the resurgence of\r\ninter-clan fighting, banditry and lawlessness are still a\r\nsource of great concern to my delegation. The people of\r\nSomalia should take full advantage of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping efforts and of the OAU mediation effort led\r\nby President Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, and forge a\r\npolitical settlement based on sharing the power among the\r\nSomali nation as a whole. Zimbabwe has contributed two\r\nbattalions to peace-keeping in Somalia. As we start\r\ngradually withdrawing those battalions, we hope they will\r\nnot be called back to a Somalia where law and order have\r\nbroken down again.\r\nWe are glad that the Identification Commission of the\r\nUnited Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western\r\nSahara (MINURSO), has begun its work, and we urge both\r\nparties speedily to resolve any outstanding impediments to\r\nthe holding of the referendum in that country - and we\r\nknow from debates in this Hall that there have been many\r\nimpediments. The quest for self-determination in Western\r\nSahara has taken too long, and has remained on our\r\ninternational agenda for a long time. It should therefore not\r\nbe delayed any further.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the recent major\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process which have\r\nbrought the people of Palestine closer to their inalienable\r\nright to self-determination. While we fully support that\r\npeace process, we believe that it should proceed on the\r\nbasis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\r\n(1973) and 425 (1975), and that the international\r\ncommunity should continue to monitor developments in\r\nthat region closely so as to generate and maintain the\r\nmomentum for change. The people of Palestine still need\r\nand deserve our continued support until they reach the\r\ngoal of nationhood in a Palestinian State with its capital\r\nin Jerusalem.\r\nWe from the African region are particularly mindful\r\nof the inextricable link between peace, security and\r\nstability on the one hand and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment on the other. There can be no economic\r\ndevelopment without peace and stability. Central to these\r\nfundamental concerns about peace and stability are the\r\nbasic issues of protecting human rights and democratic\r\ngovernance. We believe that high priority must be given\r\nto these issues in our national policies. Consequently,\r\ndictatorial and non-democratic regimes should be shunned\r\nand isolated by all of us and by the international\r\ncommunity at large, as well as by regional organizations.\r\nThe curtailment of people’s participation in\r\ndecision-making processes undermines the capacity of\r\ncountries to provide all their people with even the basic\r\nnecessities of life including food, water and shelter and\r\nbasic social services such as education and health.\r\nZimbabwe believes that international efforts to\r\npromote peace, stability and security where these do not\r\nexist or are threatened can largely be facilitated through\r\nregional organizations and good neighbours. We in\r\nAfrica have taken concrete measures in this regard by\r\nestablishing a permanent mechanism of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) for the prevention, management\r\nand resolution of conflict. It is in keeping with the spirit\r\nof regional arrangements that the countries belonging to\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) joined hands in addressing the situation in\r\nLiberia - work that still continues - and that we in the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) took\r\nthe initiative in Lesotho to which I have already referred.\r\nIn our view, such arrangements could also be devised to\r\naddress situations elsewhere in our continent, for example\r\nin Rwanda, Burundi and Somalia. What we are urging is\r\nthe involvement of regional organizations, subregional\r\norganizations and neighbourly countries in conflict\r\nresolution and conflict management, because they know\r\nthe problems and they know the issues.\r\nFor such regional arrangements to become\r\nsustainable it is essential that other regional organizations\r\nand the United Nations extend a helping hand by\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nproviding financial and other material assistance. For\r\nindeed, what are initially regarded as internal or local\r\nconflicts have the potential, if left unattended, to grow into\r\ntrouble spots threatening international peace and security\r\nitself.\r\nThis is an auspicious time for the family of nations to\r\nfurther the goal and achieve the objective that the founding\r\nfathers of our Organization had foremost in their minds: -\r\nthat of disarmament. In this context, my delegation is of\r\nthe view that the extension and review Conference of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\r\nscheduled to be held in March 1995 is a unique opportunity\r\nfor practical steps to be taken to ensure the total elimination\r\nof nuclear weapons. Clearly, the treaty itself is\r\ndiscriminatory and the nuclear-weapon States have not fully\r\nimplemented their obligations under article VI of the\r\nTreaty. Several speakers today have referred to the\r\ninadequacies of the Treaty. We will not support any\r\nindefinite and unconditional extension of the NPT in its\r\npresent form. The nuclear-weapon States must undertake\r\nto reduce and eliminate their nuclear arsenals within an\r\nestablished and binding timetable. As a demonstration of\r\ntheir good faith they must also stop impeding the early\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Only then\r\nwill a nuclear non-proliferation regime be meaningful.\r\nLast year the Non-Aligned Movement submitted a\r\ndraft resolution asking the Assembly to request an advisory\r\nopinion from the International Court of Justice on the\r\nlegality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.\r\nThis was in pursuance of a long-standing position of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement favouring complete disarmament.\r\nRegrettably, that draft resolution was not brought to the\r\nvote. We are, however, glad that the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement has this year decided to submit the draft\r\nresolution once more, and to press it to the vote in the\r\nAssembly. This initiative is deserving of the strongest\r\nsupport of all members. In recent years nuclear\r\ndisarmament has become a bilateral issue; yet the\r\ninternational community has a right to play a central role in\r\nensuring that the nuclear threat, which affects all mankind,\r\nis removed forever. If the Assembly were to request an\r\nadvisory opinion from the International Court of Justice,\r\nnuclear disarmament would be brought back into the\r\nmultilateral forum where it belongs, so critical issues\r\nrelated to nuclear proliferation and nuclear controls could\r\nbe discussed openly and commented upon in the General\r\nAssembly. It would also be consistent with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendation on resort to International Court\r\nof Justice advisory opinions in his report entitled \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\" and would give impetus to the process\r\nof nuclear disarmament, which has begun to flag in the\r\npost-cold-war era. The Non-Aligned Movement is to be\r\ncongratulated for having taken this initiative this year; we\r\nhope it will gain the support of the Assembly.\r\nWe all agree that there have been so many changes\r\non the international scene that the present Charter and\r\nmethods of operation of the United Nations should be\r\nrevised to meet the challenges and aspirations of a new\r\nand changing world order.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation has already put forward\r\nsome very specific proposals, which I will not recapitulate\r\nin any detail here. Those proposals are now part of the\r\nAfrican common position paper which refers to the\r\npowers of the Security Council, the General Assembly\r\nand the relationship of those bodies to the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and to the specialized agencies. This subject\r\nhas been referred to by a number of speakers from this\r\nrostrum; indeed, the speakers from Africa have repeated\r\nthe African common position.\r\nIt is quite clear that the present arrangement, where\r\nAfrica and the Latin American region are not represented\r\nat all amongst the veto-wielding permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council, should not be allowed to continue.\r\nThe underrepresentation of these two regions is both\r\nundemocratic and unfair, and I hope that the matter will\r\nbe addressed at the appropriate time in terms of the\r\nAfrican common position.\r\nFurthermore, any exercise in the revitalization of the\r\nUnited Nations should envisage coordination of the\r\nactivities of the Bretton Woods institutions to which I\r\nhave already referred.\r\nWe are pleased that world-wide socio-economic\r\nproblems of equitable utilization and distribution of\r\nresources are going to be fully addressed at the Far Social\r\nDevelopment World Summit in Copenhagen next year.\r\nSeveral important conferences have recently been held\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations: the Rio\r\nConference on Environment and Development and the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nheld in Cairo in Cairo. We are now looking forward to\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development, to be held in\r\nCopenhagen next year, and the Fourth World Conference\r\non Women, to take place in Beijing later next year.\r\nThese conferences all address matters that are vital\r\nto the South and/or to the third-world countries as a\r\nwhole, and we hope that the social development Summit\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nwill focus on growing poverty in the world and how to\r\nattack it. The rapid development of science and technology\r\nis taking place in the middle of increasing poverty and\r\ndisease amongst large population groups, especially in the\r\nthird world. It is time we took enormous steps to eradicate\r\nworld poverty and to create full employment. We hope that\r\nthe combined efforts of the environment and population\r\nConferences, to which I have already referred, and the\r\nsocial development Summit and the Beijing Conference will\r\nmobilize the international community for a final and\r\nsustained attack on world poverty.\r\nZimbabwe believes that at the national level it is\r\nimperative that development put people first by promoting\r\nsocial development through employment-creation\r\nopportunities and other poverty- eradication programmes.\r\nIn our view, the provision of adequate food, water and\r\nshelter as well as such basic social services as education,\r\ntraining and health is an absolute imperative. In the\r\npromotion of opportunities for increased popular\r\nparticipation, the enhancement of the role and status of\r\nwomen requires paramount attention.Employment creation\r\nrequires greater private initiative and increased investment.\r\nThus domestic policies have to be pursued with the aim of\r\ncreating a favourable environment for investment.\r\nThe critical economic situation in Africa - the least\r\ndeveloped and most marginalized of all the regions of the\r\nworld - has to be addressed if global economic growth and\r\ninterdependence are to have any meaning at all. With 90\r\nper cent of all poverty stricken people in developing\r\ncountries, the eradication of poverty remains a major\r\nconcern at both the national and the international levels.\r\nYet neither the economic reform measures which we are\r\ncarrying out nor our efforts to alleviate and eradicate\r\npoverty can be expected to succeed without the provision\r\nof adequate financial resources on a predictable, assured\r\nand continuous basis, and we appeal to those countries that\r\nhave surplus resources to increase their support and aid to\r\nthe developing countries.\r\nFor most developing countries the issue of resource\r\nflows cannot be dissociated from that of the external debt\r\nproblem, a problem that has also been addressed in many\r\nstatements to the Assembly. Figures available clearly\r\nindicate that the overall debt of the developing countries is\r\nstill on the increase - from some $800 billion in 1982 to\r\n$l.4 trillion in 1992 - and it continues to rise. Combined\r\nwith the interest rates, the figures are constantly growing,\r\nindeed becoming staggering. We believe that new,\r\ncomprehensive and coordinated approaches to the debt and\r\ndebt- servicing problems have to be adopted, including\r\noutright cancellation or at least the application of the\r\nmeasures proposed under the Trinidad terms for low-\r\nincome developing countries.\r\nZimbabwe believes that the expansion of\r\ninternational trade is essential to economic growth and is\r\nindeed an integral part of development. We therefore\r\nconsider the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations to be an important\r\nachievement which deserves to be welcomed by\r\ndeveloping and developed countries alike. We also\r\nwelcome the landmark agreement to create the new World\r\nTrade Organization, which we hope will reinforce the\r\nmultilateral trading system. We welcome the meetings\r\nthat have been arranged both in Africa and elsewhere to\r\nstudy the impact of the Uruguay Round agreement and\r\nthe World Trade Organization on our economies.\r\nWe reiterate the hope that these developments will\r\nimprove the access of developing countries’ exports to\r\nmarkets in developed countries, and that the new\r\nconditionalities or new forms of protectionism under the\r\nguise of social or environmental clauses will be avoided.\r\nParticular attention has also to be paid to the critical need\r\nfor the diversification of the African economies. In that\r\nregard, we once again reiterate the need for the\r\ninternational community to support our proposal for the\r\ncreation of a diversification facility for the development\r\nof the African commodity sector.\r\nFinally we would urge the big Powers - and\r\nespecially the United States - to adopt a policy of\r\ndialogue rather than confrontation in resolving disputes\r\nwith smaller Powers around the globe. In particular, we\r\nwould urge full-scale discussion and dialogue with Cuba\r\naimed at normalizing relations with a small neighbouring\r\ncountry in the American region, dialogue with Libya in\r\norder to get a fair and just trial for those suspected of\r\ncausing the Lockerbie air disaster, and the continuation of\r\nthe meetings with the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea in order to resolve the issues related to nuclear-\r\nweapons development and, hopefully, pave the way for\r\nthe reunification or North and South Korea.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, global peace - so\r\nmuch coveted -is now within our reach. A concerted\r\neffort by regional organizations and the international\r\ncommunity can get us to the promised land of\r\ninternational peace. We should try and try again, but the\r\nattainment of peace is not the task of international\r\norganizations alone: it is also the task of national\r\nGovernments and national leaders.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nIn this context we would like to appeal to the leaders\r\nin the Gulf to pursue the path of peace that has been\r\ncharted for them by the United Nations in several\r\nresolutions, and to assure them that any attempt at\r\noccupying other countries in the Gulf, such as the one we\r\nwitnessed in 1991, will not be accepted by the Assembly or\r\nby the international community as a whole.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Carlos Morales Troncoso, Secretary of State for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Dominican Republic.\r\nMr. Morales-Troncoso (Dominican Republic)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): On behalf of the Dominican\r\nRepublic and its Constitutional President, Mr. Joaquin\r\nBalaguer, I offer to the President of the General Assembly\r\nat its forty-ninth session, Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire, our congratulations on his\r\nwell-deserved election.\r\nLikewise, our delegation pays a tribute of gratitude to\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, for his stewardship of the\r\nwork of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly,\r\nand, especially, to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has dedicated all\r\nhis time and effort to ensuring full observance of the\r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nMy Government’s policy towards the pressing need for\r\ndevelopment is exemplified by the urgent efforts it is\r\nmaking on behalf of its people in the changing context of\r\ntoday’s world.\r\nForty-nine years ago, when the United Nations system\r\nwas created following the end of a second major world-\r\nwide conflagration, the idea and hope prevailed of bringing\r\nabout a new world order that would exorcize the spectre of\r\nwar and, once and for all, do away with war’s attendant\r\nhuman degradation and hatred.\r\nHowever, the victorious emergence of two\r\nideologically opposed Powers led to the creation of a\r\nbipolar international system that gave birth to the so-called\r\ncold war, marked by lateral confrontation and an arms race\r\nwhich, because of the ever-present possibility of direct\r\nconfrontation, could have led to a nuclear holocaust and the\r\nannihilation of mankind.\r\nThus it was that the General Assembly became the\r\nstage par excellence for the airing and debate of the most\r\nurgent world-wide problems. While its political\r\neffectiveness may not have met all the requirements of\r\npeace because of the structure of world power that had\r\nprevailed since 1945, it did achieve overwhelming success\r\nin the actions and programmes of its specialized agencies.\r\nBorn to foster peace and security and to promote\r\ndevelopment, the United Nations was the fruit of the post-\r\nSecond-World-War era. At that time peace meant the\r\nabsence of war and of the justifiable fear of world-wide\r\nself-destruction.\r\nThe hope for a renewed international order based on\r\nnew values has gained momentum. Unique and\r\nmonumentaL events symbolized by the razing of the \"wall\r\nof infamy\" have created the propitious conditions and\r\nopportunities for recapturing and relaunching the lofty\r\ngoals of the signers of the San Francisco Charter.\r\nThose events summon us to struggle for a world\r\nbuilt on solidarity, respect for the self-determination of\r\npeoples, and the quest for a better standard of living for\r\nall.\r\nA new world and its agonizing challenges require\r\nnew answers and clear and unambiguous objectives\r\ncombined with an iron will to achieve them. The human\r\nbeing must be at the centre of all concerns. Our efforts\r\nmust thus be aimed at combating poverty and achieving\r\nsocial justice. We must foster new democratic ways for\r\nthe exercise of power and genuine respect for human\r\nrights. In other words, we must ensure that democracy\r\nworks, prospers and prevails.\r\nUnquestionably, the present-day world is beset by\r\neconomic and political complexities incompatible with the\r\naspirations of people everywhere to a decent life.\r\nGlobalization of the economy, intense financial\r\ncompetition, national cultural diversity, and the various\r\ntensions between groups, countries and regions, typified\r\nby the ethnic and religious regional conflicts of recent\r\nyears, constitute the features of the new reality.\r\nThe answers to these challenges and problems are no\r\nlonger to be found in the use of arms. They lie in the\r\nwill to build a consensus and in the ability to promote\r\ndevelopment through fair competition regulated by rules\r\nthat are accepted by all participants.\r\nUnless world peace is at stake, the threat or use of\r\nforce is no longer a viable instrument for achieving the\r\ndecent life to which all peoples are entitled.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nHow, then, can we defend democracy and ensure that,\r\nrather than perish, it becomes stronger and more effective\r\nin dealing with starvation, unemployment, drug trafficking,\r\nthe depletion of natural resources, forced migration and the\r\nnew forms of trade protectionism that undermine\r\ndevelopment?\r\nIf, indeed, we are to protect human rights and\r\nstrengthen democracy, we must undertake a thorough\r\nreview of this whole issue and of the very concept of\r\ndevelopment on the basis of equitable access to markets,\r\ncapital and new technologies.\r\nThe Dominican Republic is one of the most solid and\r\ndeeply rooted democracies on the American continent. It\r\nis one of the few Latin American democracies in modern\r\ntimes with a record of lasting and commendable political\r\nstability. It is an example of harmonious and civilized\r\ncoexistence in a society marked by contrasts. We have\r\nshown to the world that our democracy is participatory,\r\nwith reconciliation and dialogue as the channels for the\r\nsolution of the major political and economic crises that we\r\nhave experienced.\r\nIn the economic arena, global interdependence poses\r\nchallenges, and yet offers opportunities. We must therefore\r\nmake progress in harmonizing financial, technological and\r\nproduction policies in order to achieve growth at all levels.\r\nThe development of the most industrialized nations\r\nmay be inadequate without the growth of developing\r\nnations. The greatest growth in outlets for the commodities\r\nof industrialized countries will be found in the markets of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe are witnessing a transition towards trade\r\nliberalization that can lead to freer trade and the eradication\r\nof poverty through the creation of more and better jobs.\r\nHowever, certain threats appear on the horizon. One\r\nof them is neoprotectionism. Even though the \"barbed-\r\nwire\" hostility of former protectionist tariffs is being\r\ndismantled, the re-emerging protectionism may not be based\r\non tariffs, but it conceals certain invisible, yet genuine\r\nenemies: environmental regulations, customs barriers,\r\nquotas, anti-\"dumping\" rules, social clauses and others. In\r\nthis way the aspirations to free trade may become mere\r\nrhetoric.\r\nImpoverishment is another threat. Are we fully aware\r\nthat opening up our economies can cause us to overlook the\r\nneed to properly administer their attendant social costs?\r\nUnemployment and the acceleration of social\r\ninvestment plans threaten to negate the efforts we have\r\nmade over many years to democratize our political\r\nsystems. While the formation of economic blocs is an\r\nestablished fact, it gives us pause nevertheless: To what\r\nextent might this phenomenon constitute a stumbling\r\nblock for a world based on the democratic rules of free\r\ntrade and on equal conditions for all?\r\nAs members know, more emphasis is placed on\r\nselling than on producing. However, we do not have\r\nadequate means of production or fair access to them; yet\r\nwe are supposed to compete on an equal basis with the\r\nmore industrialized countries of the world. These are not\r\ninvalid complaints and claims. New rules must be\r\nworked out to permit developing countries to gain access\r\nto technology and finance their infrastructures on\r\nfavourable terms - in other words, to attain practical and\r\nacceptable levels of competitiveness.\r\nHow can we meet these new challenges? To begin\r\nwith, any development policy must attempt to modernize\r\nour sources of production. If we have little or nothing to\r\nsell, what is the point of continuing to open up our\r\nmarkets? This is closely linked to the development of a\r\nproper transport and communication infrastructure and to\r\nthe optimum use of energy sources.\r\nWe must thus create new conditions of productivity,\r\nparticularly in the fields of technology social\r\ndevelopment. If human beings are to be the focus of all\r\ndevelopment policy, the fostering of effective programmes\r\nbecomes the best possible business. An investment in\r\nhealth, education and housing is profitable not only\r\nsocially but economically.\r\nAll these initiatives and actions to meet the new\r\nchallenges that stem from the globalization of the\r\neconomy must be viewed in that context. Therefore we\r\nneed a new kind of cooperation, which must be the\r\nkeynote of international activities. Among other things,\r\nwe must adjust national policies to global objectives. We\r\nshould be able to achieve a new idea of cooperation.\r\nCooperation is the alternative to intervention, the way to\r\nfulfil the international community’s desires for peace,\r\nstability and democracy.\r\nIn this new age, we must be keenly aware of the\r\ntrends that are shaping the end of this century and the\r\nbeginning of the next. The world is becoming smaller,\r\nmore interdependent and globalized; the survival of\r\nhuman life is gravely threatened by the deterioration of\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nthe environment and by short-sighted, uncoordinated\r\npolicies to stem the tide of problems besetting the planet.\r\nWe in the Dominican Republic, have our share of\r\nproblems, but one stands out: we live geographically next\r\ndoor to the poorest nation of the hemisphere. Haiti has\r\nwritten glorious pages in the history of the struggle for\r\nfreedom and equality. Its past, heavy with confrontation\r\nand long periods of authoritarian rule, has unfortunately\r\nturned it into a nation requiring international assistance.\r\nThere must therefore be a determined and generous show\r\nof cooperation on the part of the international community\r\nso that the Haitian people may pursue its destiny -\r\neconomic and social, as well as political. The Dominican\r\nRepublic has always been ready to cooperate in effective\r\ninitiatives for the betterment and viability of needy\r\ncountries, whose peoples have every right to live in dignity,\r\nwith all the opportunities offered to others.\r\nThe problem of drug trafficking and narcotics\r\nconsumption continues to be a scourge of world-wide\r\ndimensions. It is the Dominican Republic’s State policy to\r\ndeal most severely, in keeping with our legal provisions,\r\nwith the trafficking, consumption and possession of narcotic\r\ndrugs. What is more, our country has offered, and will\r\ncontinue to offer, its cooperation to other nations in the\r\napprehension, prosecution or extradition of those who have\r\nmade this criminal trade the most lucrative activity of our\r\nnew times.\r\nAlthough the developed countries are the most\r\nattractive market for the sale of narcotic drugs, the\r\nunderdeveloped countries, whether or not they are\r\nproducers of narcotic drugs, have seen an increase in drug\r\naddiction too. The entire international community must\r\ncontinue resolutely to deal with this scourge so that drug\r\nabuse does not become the side effect of a seductively\r\nexcessive well-being or the amnesia-inducing product that\r\nhelps some to cope with poverty.\r\nThe Dominican Republic, a nation of pacifist\r\ntraditions, will continue to support the efforts of the United\r\nNations in preventing armed conflicts and in the\r\nestablishment, maintenance and consolidation of\r\ninternational peace and the internal peace of all nations.\r\nIn another field of endeavour, the Dominican Republic\r\nretains the concern voiced at last year’s session of the\r\nAssembly on the proposal made by the Secretary-General\r\nto merge the United Nations International Research and\r\nTraining Institute for the Advancement of Women\r\n(INSTRAW) and the United Nations Development Fund for\r\nWomen (UNIFEM). INSTRAW was conceived at the first\r\nWorld Conference of the International Women’s Year,\r\nheld in Mexico City, and was created pursuant to the\r\ndecision of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Dominican Republic takes this occasion to\r\nreiterate its request that INSTRAW and UNIFEM not be\r\nmerged. We also request retention of the commitments\r\nentered into under Economic and Social Council\r\nresolution 1998/LX, of 12 May 1976, which establishes\r\nthe permanent headquarters of INSTRAW in the\r\nDominican Republic, so that our great city in the\r\nAmericas may continue to host that important organ.\r\nWe are deluding ourselves if we think that peace,\r\nsecurity and development can be pursued as separate\r\ngoals at either the national level or the international level.\r\nThe new order and new balance that are coming into\r\nbeing call for new ways of thinking and new priorities.\r\nThey require a reappraisal of current international realities\r\nin the light of established norms with regard to the\r\nsovereignty of all nations and recognition of the pluralism\r\nof the world’s peoples.\r\nThe new era demands that confrontation turn into\r\ndialogue and that calls for justice be replaced by shared\r\ncommitments of peoples.\r\nThe promising, peaceful future of which we all\r\nspeak in meetings and assemblies will come about if,\r\nabove all, we, the Governments of our region, do our bit,\r\nwithout haggling or imposing conditions, according to our\r\nmaterial and leadership potential.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall upon His Excellency Mr. Bolong L. Sonko, Minister\r\nof External Affairs of the Republic of the Gambia.\r\nMr. Sonko (Gambia): My delegation welcomes the\r\nelection of Ambassador Amara Essy as President of the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly with a\r\ngenuine feeling of great pride and satisfaction; he is not\r\nonly our neighbour in the West African subregion, but a\r\nseasoned diplomat. He is certainly no stranger here,\r\nhaving served his great country, Côte d’Ivoire, as\r\nPermanent Representative at the United Nations for many\r\nyears. We in the Gambia hold him in high esteem for his\r\nconstructive and positive contributions to problems of\r\ncommon concern, both at the bilateral and multilateral\r\nlevels. I have no doubt that those qualities, for which he\r\nis well known, will contribute immensely to the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of our deliberations. I should\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\ntherefore like to congratulate him warmly on his\r\nassumption of office and to assure him of the full support\r\nof my delegation in carrying out his important mandate.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to\r\nAmbassador Insanally for the excellent manner in which he\r\nperformed his duties during his tenure of office last year.\r\nIn the same vein, I wish to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his untiring efforts\r\nand effective leadership in ensuring the realization of the\r\nideals for which our Organization, the United Nations, was\r\nfounded.\r\nMy delegation joins many previous speakers in\r\nwholeheartedly welcoming South Africa to the Assembly\r\nafter a 20- year absence. The advent of a non-racial,\r\ndemocratic Government in South Africa symbolized a\r\nsignificant turning point in the constitutional and colonial\r\nhistory of South Africa, in particular, and of Africa in\r\ngeneral. The resilience and resourcefulness that have\r\nguided and inspired the people of South Africa in the\r\ncrucial years of their march to a non-racial and democratic\r\nGovernment will, I have no doubt, serve as important assets\r\nin South Africa’s effective participation in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nOn 22 July this year there was a peaceful removal of\r\nGovernment in the Gambia, when it was replaced by the\r\nArmed Forces Provisional Ruling Council under the\r\nchairmanship of His Excellency Lieutenant Yahya A.J.J.\r\nJammeh. This change was caused by a series of events and\r\ndevelopments within the country that the previous\r\nGovernment had neglected and in some cases had refused\r\nto address. The continued abuse and misuse of political\r\npower and of public office, coupled with serious corrupt\r\npractices at various levels of Government departments,\r\nnecessitated this action.\r\nMr. Ngendahayo (Burundi), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe Gambia has since independence in 1965 enjoyed\r\na relatively long period as a democratic State and as a\r\npolitically stable country. We acknowledge this\r\nachievement, but at the same time we also have good\r\nreasons why the Government in power had to be removed.\r\nIn the evolution of nation States a stable political\r\nsystem is essential in any country for peace, security,\r\nstability and development. When that stability comes under\r\nincreasing strain, however, and is threatened from within by\r\ncertain important officials of Government and politicians\r\nalike, the preservation of that stability and national\r\nintegrity becomes more important than anything else.\r\nThere is no political system that is perfect. We take\r\nthe view that when a democratic political system is under\r\nattack by some unscrupulous individuals holding public\r\noffice through corrupt practices and other selfish acts, in\r\nopen violation of the moral tenets of honesty,\r\ncommitment, discipline and hard work, it becomes\r\nnecessary to institute corrective measures to stop and\r\nprevent that system’s decay and instability.\r\nThe privilege of being the people’s representatives\r\ndoes not confer any rights that entitle those\r\nrepresentatives to do anything other than the people’s\r\nbusiness. The restoration of public trust and confidence\r\nin government in the older democracies is an\r\ninstitutionalized process that has acquired value and\r\nstability. The mechanisms that protect the State and\r\nallow for a peaceful and acceptable mode of restoration\r\nof public trust and confidence have been tested and\r\nproved effective over time.\r\nThat action is reinforced by the fact that the strength\r\nof democratic societies lies with the people, who freely\r\nparticipate in the political process and select or elect their\r\nrepresentatives. The legitimacy of government derives,\r\ntherefore, from the expressed will of the people to have\r\na government that will promote and protect their rights as\r\nwell as the collective interest of society.\r\nIn the newer democracies, however, where there are\r\nno mechanisms or institutions that can protect and\r\npreserve the essence of the democratic process, there has\r\nbeen a tendency, in response to a moral imperative, to\r\ntake radical measures that are intended to arrest the abuse\r\nof political power and the misuse of executive authority\r\nin the interest of society as a whole.\r\nWe wish to emphasize that the events that took place\r\nin the Gambia in July this year must be understood as\r\npolitically necessary to allow for corrective measures to\r\nbe put in place and to usher in a new and equitable\r\ndemocratic political system. In this connection, the\r\npresent provisional Government’s overriding objective is\r\nto set up those institutions that would provide the\r\nnecessary checks and balances and thus enhance the\r\ndemocratic process in the Gambia and the right of the\r\npeople to elect a government of their choice.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nThe essence of a democratic political system is, in\r\naddition to its inclusive character, its ability to promote the\r\npolitical, economic, civil, social and cultural rights of the\r\nindividual and of the community as a whole. Any\r\nunbalanced approach to the promotion of those rights\r\nrenders the system less democratic, less responsive and thus\r\nmore suspect.\r\nAny democratically elected Government that only\r\npromotes the civil and political rights of its people and\r\nneglects the promotion of their social, cultural and\r\neconomic rights, or that deliberately fails to provide equal\r\nopportunities for all its people, forfeits, in our view, its\r\nright to govern. The challenge that faces democratic\r\nGovernments - and any Government, for that matter - is\r\nhow to promote that cluster of human rights without giving\r\nany undue attention to a few of them. In other words, the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights requires a\r\nbalanced approach as opposed to an unbalanced one.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally - the President\r\nof the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session - in his\r\naddress to those who participated in the Second\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored Democracies,\r\nwhich was held in Managua, Nicaragua, in July, said:\r\n\"To survive and flourish, democracy must be\r\nprovided with an infrastructure of institutions which\r\nare conducive to the culture of a free society. Each\r\ncitizen must be guaranteed, in addition to his or her\r\nfundamental human rights, opportunity for economic\r\nand social development. ... Basic rights such as\r\neducation, health and housing must be provided by the\r\nState to guarantee a stable society in which democratic\r\nnorms and practices can prevail.\"\r\nThe Gambia subscribes fully to the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights of 1948, the International\r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International\r\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the\r\nAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and other\r\nhuman-rights instruments. We shall continue to respect our\r\nobligations under these international covenants. In this\r\nregard, we shall also continue to give full support to the\r\nCommission on Human and Peoples’ Rights of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the African Centre for\r\nDemocracy and Human Rights Studies, which are based in\r\nBanjul.\r\nTo those who, in these times of new and emergent\r\ndemocracies in Africa and elsewhere, may argue that the\r\nGambia had a genuine democratic system we wish to\r\nrestate that democracy as practised in our country had\r\ncertain fundamental weaknesses, which failed to allow\r\nchange to emerge from within the democratic process. We\r\naffirm our commitment to returning the country to civilian\r\nrule after addressing these inherent weaknesses.\r\nThe peaceful manner in which the people of the\r\nGambia responded to the change of Government\r\nencourages the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council\r\nto move towards a timetable that would return the country\r\nto civilian rule before long.\r\nA programme of transition and rectification will\r\nshortly be announced. This will give details of the\r\nactivities to be undertaken within a time-bound\r\nframework. As part of the programme, and in an effort to\r\ninstitutionalize transparency and accountability in our\r\nsociety, the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council is\r\nsetting up four commissions of inquiry designed to shed\r\nlight on the past practices of some public servants and\r\nformer politicians suspected of corruption and the\r\nembezzlement of public funds.\r\nThe Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council has\r\nmade it abundantly clear that much as we are determined\r\nto recover funds stolen from public coffers, there will be\r\nno witch-hunt. In pursuit of these objectives, we are\r\nmindful of the need for objectivity and impartiality. No\r\nmilitary tribunals will be set up. All the suspects will be\r\ntried in civilian courts by civilian judges.\r\nIn this connection, the new regime has already\r\napproached a number of friendly countries in our\r\nsubregion that have the same legal heritage as the Gambia\r\nand asked them to assist by providing judges with the\r\nrequisite expertise in similar exercises. In this way the\r\nobjectivity, impartiality and independence of the judiciary\r\nwill be further guaranteed.\r\nAt the same time, a Constitutional Review\r\nCommission is being established to look into certain\r\naspects of the Constitution with a view to making it more\r\nfunctional in terms of advancing the cause of democracy.\r\nAs part of this process, an independent electoral\r\ncommission will also be put in place for the same purpose\r\n- to strengthen democracy.\r\nThe military take-over was not, therefore, directed\r\nagainst any country; its purpose was to redress certain\r\ninternal difficulties. As soon as that task has been\r\ncompleted the country will be returned to civilian rule.\r\nIt is our intention to ensure that the democratic system\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nthat will be put in place in the Gambia will champion, in\r\nword and in deed, the balanced promotion and protection of\r\nall human rights and respect for those rights on the part of\r\nall those who hold public office. We look forward to the\r\nunderstanding and support of the international community\r\nat this critical phase of the transition process.\r\nIt goes without saying that while we are engaged in\r\nthis national exercise we shall also honour all our inter-\r\nnational obligations, in addition to playing an active role in\r\nthe comity of nations. I therefore take this opportunity to\r\nrenew my country’s unswerving commitment to the ideals\r\nand principles of the United Nations.\r\nWe have followed with interest the numerous events\r\nthat have taken place around the world since the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nThe situation in Liberia has always been of major\r\nconcern to us, and the failure to implement the Cotonou\r\nAccord fully has not dampened our enthusiasm. The\r\nAkosombo Agreement constitutes another attempt, in a long\r\nand tortuous peace process, to galvanize the principal\r\nplayers in the Liberian conflict in an effort to achieve a\r\ngenuine peace leading to free and fair elections. It is the\r\nfervent hope of my delegation that the continued efforts and\r\nsacrifices being made by the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and other African friends of\r\nLiberia, and indeed by the United Nations in the shape of\r\nthe continued presence of the United Nations Observer\r\nMission in Liberia (UNOMIL), will encourage the warring\r\nfactions to agree to disarm without further delay.\r\nThe Gambia has followed with keen interest recent\r\npositive political and military developments in Rwanda\r\nleading to the cessation of hostilities and the establishment\r\nof a Government of national reconciliation, which we hope\r\nwill be consolidated further. The assistance of the\r\ninternational community will continue to be needed in\r\nRwanda, not only to restore peace and stability and law and\r\norder but also to ensure the smooth, safe and speedy return\r\nof all Rwandese refugees and displaced persons to their\r\nrespective homes.\r\nWe continue to observe with concern the failure of the\r\npeace process in Somalia. The current inability of the\r\ninternational community to broker a durable peace and\r\nreconciliation between the parties to the conflict should not\r\ndeter us; rather, it should spur us to redouble our efforts\r\nand our resolve to find a satisfactory solution to the\r\nconflict.\r\nWe understand and appreciate the international\r\ncommunity’s frustration at the failure of the warring\r\nfactions to work towards reconciliation and reconstruction.\r\nBut peace is priceless and constitutes one of the principles\r\nunderlying the creation of this noble Organization, and\r\nthis is certainly not the time for the United Nations to\r\nconsider withdrawing the United Nations Operation in\r\nSomalia (UNISOM).\r\nIt is with equal concern that my delegation views the\r\nsituation in other trouble spots around the globe - notably,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nOn the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is\r\nsaddening to note that, so far, all the efforts deployed by\r\nthe international community to find a negotiated settle-\r\nment have been persistently frustrated by the Bosnian\r\nSerbs without the slightest compunction. Furthermore, the\r\nBosnian Serbs have persisted with their heinous policy of\r\n\"ethnic cleansing\" and other war crimes, in total disregard\r\nof the basic norms of international behaviour.\r\nAt the General Assembly’s last session my\r\ndelegation expressed the firm view that the defenceless\r\nMuslim population should be given the opportunity to\r\ndefend itself in accordance with Article 51 of the United\r\nNations Charter, which makes provision for the exercise\r\nof the right of self-defence. I believe that by lifting the\r\narms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina the\r\ninternational community would be sending strong and\r\nclear signals to the intransigent Bosnian Serbs.\r\nWith regard to the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir,\r\nmy delegation upholds the view that the Simla Agreement\r\nand the relevant Security Council resolutions provide a\r\nsound basis for a just and lasting solution to the conflict.\r\nWith regard to the situation between Kuwait and\r\nIraq, my delegation would like to reiterate that the key to\r\na durable solution lies in compliance by Iraq with all the\r\nUnited Nations resolutions on the issue - in particular,\r\nthose dealing with recognition of and respect for the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. However,\r\nrecent Iraqi military action does not augur well for a\r\nspeedy lifting of United Nations sanctions and the\r\nachievement of stability in the region.\r\nIn respect of the Arab-Israeli conflict, we are\r\nencouraged by the events that have been unfolding since\r\nthe signing of the Peace Accord between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The balance\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nsheet has been generally positive, and we encourage both\r\nsides to pursue the peace process.\r\nAt this juncture I should like to congratulate Jordan\r\nand Israel on the courageous and constructive step they\r\ntook recently to end the state of war between them. Such a\r\npositive development will give added credibility to the\r\nentire Middle East peace process to secure a comprehensive\r\nand durable solution in accordance with Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\r\nAnother important and worrying factor, which\r\nthreatens to undermine any political gains in our countries,\r\nis the question of poverty and the lack of economic\r\ndevelopment. Extensive external debt and debt-servicing\r\nobligations continue to be important constraints on the\r\nadvancement of the developing countries. The situation is\r\nmost acute in Africa.\r\nThe external debt of Africa as a whole has been\r\ngrowing by about 2.5 per cent yearly and for sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica the annual debt growth rate has been estimated to be\r\nas high as 7.7 per cent. This is equivalent to $199 billion,\r\nwhile debt-servicing arrears total some $45.8 billion, which\r\nis equivalent to over 20 per cent of the total debt stock.\r\nFor sub-Saharan Africa, therefore, the ratios of debt to\r\ngross national product and debt to export are almost three\r\ntimes the registered average for all developing countries,\r\nmaking it the most impoverished region in the world.\r\nThere is more than ever before an urgent need for the inter-\r\nnational community to find a lasting solution to this\r\nproblem.\r\nAgainst the background of such difficulties, it is\r\nregrettable to note that, in real terms, aid flows to Africa as\r\na whole have also been on the decline in spite of the\r\nsubstantial increase by a few countries in their levels of aid\r\nto Africa. Equally noteworthy is the failure of direct\r\nforeign investments to increase appreciatively enough to\r\nrelieve Africa’s financial crisis and stimulate economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nLet me, en passant, recall that the Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development served as a forum to\r\nraise international public awareness and renew commitment\r\nto Africa’s development. The successful implementation of\r\nthe Tokyo Declaration will depend largely on the common\r\npolitical will of African Governments and their\r\ndevelopment partners.\r\nFrom a global perspective, it is predicted that the\r\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round will link economies more\r\nstrongly through an increased flow of trade and finance\r\nbased on trade liberalization and a strengthening of the\r\nmultilateral trading system. While the liberalization of\r\ntrade as a result of the Uruguay Round may lead to a\r\nsubstantial increase in world trade and income, the impact\r\non developing countries could be less noticeable. Many\r\nAfrican countries may find themselves among the least to\r\nbenefit, partly as a result of the removal of certain\r\npreferential trade arrangements.\r\nOn a different but more positive note, it is gratifying\r\nto note that the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee\r\nfor the elaboration of an international convention to\r\ncombat desertification in those countries experiencing\r\nserious drought and/or desertification, particularly in\r\nAfrica, has completed its mandate and that a Convention\r\nhas been adopted. The three regional implementation\r\nAnnexes have also been concluded. The cumulative\r\neffects of drought and desertification on our environment\r\nas well as on the socio-economic development of our\r\ncountries have been amply demonstrated. But if this\r\nConvention is to make a difference, it must be provided\r\nwith the necessary resources to ensure its effective\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe correlation between drought and desertification\r\nand rapid population growth is well known. That is why\r\nwe welcomed the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development that has just ended in Cairo. It\r\ndemonstrated the importance of population policy as an\r\nessential ingredient of social and economic development.\r\nWe fully support the Programme of Action adopted by\r\nthe Conference and will continue to work closely with\r\ninternational, regional and national agencies, including\r\nnon-governmental organizations, to implement it, taking\r\ninto account our national priority strategies on population\r\npolicy. Similarly, the Yokohama Strategy and Plan of\r\nAction which issued from the World Conference on\r\nNatural Disaster Reduction constitute a clear reflection of\r\nour collective determination to develop and strengthen our\r\nexisting capacity for natural disaster prevention, reduction,\r\npreparedness and mitigation.\r\nWe very much welcome the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development to be held in Copenhagen in March\r\n1995. While the Conference will address three core\r\nissues - enhancing social integration; alleviating and\r\nreducing poverty; and expanding productive employment -\r\nit will none the less attract a number of social and\r\ndevelopmental issues of relevance to world social\r\nprogress and global development. For those of us in the\r\ndeveloping world, the Conference will afford the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nopportunity to address once more our socio-economic\r\ndevelopment needs while drawing attention to existing\r\nsocial ills in our societies and finding solutions to these\r\nproblems.\r\nIn the same vein, the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen to be held in Beijing will give us the opportunity\r\nto evaluate the advancement of women in light of the\r\nobjectives of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the\r\nAdvancement of Women to the year 2000. It will also\r\nprovide fresh guidelines to ensure that the targets set are\r\nachieved. Indeed, the twenty-first century holds many\r\nchallenges for mankind, but the most important and\r\npressing will be the elimination of gender discrimination.\r\nIt is now clear that the resolve to employ international\r\nmachinery for the promotion of the economic and social\r\nadvancement of all peoples is gaining ground, and that, in\r\nthe process, the United Nations provides the most\r\nappropriate forum. In order to fulfil this purpose\r\nefficiently, the ongoing consultations for restructuring and\r\nrevitalizing the United Nations system, notably that of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, should be vigorously pursued. My\r\ndelegation will continue to lend its unwavering support to\r\nthese laudable efforts. The creation of the Office of\r\nInternal Oversight Services confirms once more the\r\nimportance of the effective management of the\r\nOrganization’s limited resources. Urgent attention should\r\nalso be given to strengthening cooperation and coordination\r\nbetween agencies of the United Nations system, the United\r\nNations and the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nFinally, I should like to reaffirm my Government’s\r\ncommitment to the work of the United Nations and the\r\npreservation of international peace and security. Gambia\r\nwill continue to give full support to the international effort\r\nto address the social, economic and environmental problems\r\nfacing mankind. The joy we share with other nations as\r\nMembers of the United Nations is matched only by our\r\nrespect for each Member of this commonwealth of nations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of\r\nthe Comoros, His Excellency Mr. Said Mohamed Sagaf.\r\nMr. Sagaf (Comoros) (interpretation from French):\r\nAt the outset, I should like, on behalf of the delegation of\r\nthe Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, to extend to\r\nMr. Essy my warmest congratulations on his election to the\r\npresidency of our Assembly. I am convinced that his\r\nwealth of experience in international relations will be for us\r\nthe best guarantee for the success of our work. Through\r\nhim, the Assembly has also paid resounding tribute to his\r\ncountry, Côte d’Ivoire, and to one of its illustrious\r\ndeparted sons, the late President Houphouët-Boigny, a\r\ngreat statesman and acknowledged visionary whose\r\nwisdom and intelligence made a great contribution to the\r\nadvent of a world of peace and progress.\r\nI wish to join previous speakers in expressing\r\nprofound gratitude to his predecessor for the effectiveness\r\nwith which he presided over the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-eighth session.\r\nI also take this opportunity to convey to Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, our Secretary-General, our high esteem\r\nand fraternal gratitude for his tireless efforts to reduce\r\npockets of tension and strengthen international peace and\r\nsecurity. His devotion and talent reinforce the role of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThese past five years, the world has seen great\r\nupheavals that have put an end to the cold war and\r\nideological blocs. Despite the emergence of certain\r\nconflicts, the world is on the threshold of a new, more\r\npromising era in which dialogue and joint action seem to\r\nbe prevailing over confrontation.\r\nWe are one year away from the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the establishment of the United Nations, and in the\r\npresent circumstances we must think about defining the\r\nnew missions our Organization has to carry out, in\r\naddition to those bestowed on us by history. Even if the\r\ngoal of a peaceful world society has not yet been reached,\r\nit is acknowledged that our Organization has contributed\r\nbroadly to decolonization and the progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law. Of the positive results\r\nachieved by the United Nations, the definition and\r\npromotion of human rights is inarguably the most\r\nimportant. This world forum has made it possible for\r\ndeveloping States to make the international community\r\nmore aware of their difficulties and to express their\r\ndemands. Thanks to the United Nations, some global\r\nproblems, such as those of population and environment,\r\nhave become priority concerns for all nations, small or\r\nlarge, rich or poor.\r\nThe climate of détente and the easing of tensions in\r\ninternational relations undoubtedly made it possible to\r\nresolve the conflict that beset South Africa for so long.\r\nThe first non-racial, democratic elections held in South\r\nAfrica, resulting in the election of President Nelson\r\nMandela, are the best evidence of the positive\r\ndevelopment of law there. My country is particularly\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\npleased to see the Republic of South Africa occupying its\r\nseat in our great family. All Africa places its hopes in\r\nSouth Africa, whose leaders have demonstrated wisdom and\r\ndetermination. We earnestly hope South Africa will be able\r\nto pass peacefully and harmoniously through its new stage\r\nof transition.\r\nOne of this year’s felicitous events is clearly the\r\nconcretization of the peace process that started with the\r\nWashington agreements between the Palestinians and the\r\nIsraelis. Their mutual recognition has provided fresh\r\nimpetus, and it heralds an era of peace in that part of the\r\nworld, which has for so long been bloodied by war. I take\r\nthis opportunity to congratulate President Arafat and the\r\nPalestinian people on their tireless efforts to give Palestine\r\na sovereign, independent State within internationally\r\nrecognized boundaries.\r\nIf peace is to be established in the Middle East, there\r\nmust be a comprehensive settlement of the differences\r\nbetween the State of Israel and the Arab States of the\r\nregion. The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, an\r\nArabic-speaking and French-speaking African State, will\r\nspare no effort in sincerely encouraging all the parties\r\nconcerned to strive for peace. We therefore welcome the\r\nagreement reached between the Kingdom of Jordan and\r\nIsrael.\r\nMy country has always respected our Organization’s\r\nprinciples, and therefore has always advocated dialogue and\r\nconcertation in the settlement of conflicts. In that spirit, it\r\nendorsed the General Assembly’s recommendations on the\r\nquestion of the Comorian island of Mayotte. Need I recall\r\nthat in this regrettable dispute, which started 19 years ago,\r\n[between the Comoros and France], in 1975, the Comorian\r\nauthorities have always expressed a willingness to negotiate\r\nwith France on the legal and practical modalities for the\r\nreturn of the Comorian island of Mayotte to its natural\r\ncommunity. Unfortunately, France has always opposed\r\nconcertation on this issue. Quite the contrary: that great\r\ncountry, an unchallenged defender of human rights, is\r\nprolonging its administrative and military presence in\r\nMayotte. It has also undertaken in this part of our small\r\nterritory reforms and socio-economic development plans\r\nwhose clear aim is to separate for all time the four sister\r\nislands that geography, history, race, religion, language and\r\neconomy had joined together with ties that were both\r\nidentical and complementary. For Comorians, faith and\r\ndignity have made this problem a cardinal point of our\r\nsovereign existence.\r\nWhile we take note of the tangible results of the\r\nrebirth of democracy in Eastern Europe, the opening up\r\nof Africa to multiparty politics and the easing of tensions\r\nbetween Powers, we cannot be but concerned at the\r\nappearance of conflicts that are undermining world\r\nstability and equilibrium. The case of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is a constant and striking reminder that we\r\nstill have a long, long way to go on the road to lasting\r\npeace. My country calls on the Serb and Bosnian parties\r\nto comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions\r\nand to accept the plan for territorial division proposed by\r\nthe Contact Group. Nothing would be more tragic than\r\nallowing passion and pride to prevail over reason and take\r\nprecedence over the lives of thousands of women,\r\nchildren and old people, who are the daily victims of this\r\nincomprehensible conflict.\r\nWe are equally at a loss when we look at the\r\ngenocide that has ravaged Rwanda. We still wonder how\r\nall the macabre events that have torn Rwanda apart could\r\nhave taken place. Fortunately, peace has been restored\r\nand normalization seems to be gaining ground. I take this\r\nopportunity to express our deepest gratitude to France for\r\n\"Operation Turquoise,\" as well as to all the States that\r\nsupported that operation, for without it Rwanda would\r\nhave ceased to exist. We express our gratitude to the\r\nneighboring States for the very African hospitality they\r\nshowed in saving the lives of human beings in distress.\r\nI urgently appeal to the new Government of Rwanda to\r\nspare no effort to bring about national unity, without\r\nwhich the reconstruction of Rwanda cannot be assured.\r\nIn addition, we salute the courage and determination\r\nof the political authorities and the people of Burundi for\r\ntheir avoidance of another tragedy with incalculable\r\nconsequences.\r\nThe international community must assist Africa -\r\nparticularly the Organization of African Unity, which has\r\nnever remained indifferent to the various conflicts that\r\nhave embroiled certain Member States - to prevent\r\nconflicts and manage them better. It is imperative that\r\nwe finally wake up to Africa’s economic realities and\r\nunderstand that its instability and destitution are a\r\nstanding threat to society throughout the world.\r\nWhile we recognize that the world political situation\r\nhas eased considerably, we must also take note that the\r\ninternational economic situation shows us no glimmer of\r\nhope. Political stability will be fragile if there is not a\r\nclear improvement in the economic sphere and, in\r\nparticular, if growth is limited to the wealthy countries.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nThe developing countries are bearing the full brunt of the\r\nill effects of the crisis, in the form of deteriorating terms of\r\ntrade, rising protectionism, decreasing net flows of external\r\nresources and, on top of all that, the debt burden, which\r\nnullifies the efforts of the developing countries.\r\nThe widening gap between wealthy and poor countries\r\nreduces the effects of the economic recovery in the\r\nindustrialized countries in recent years has seemed to be\r\nclearly appearing on the horizon. In this context, it is our\r\ncollective responsibility to combat poverty, famine and\r\ndestitution in the developing countries.\r\nGiven the distress of the developing countries and an\r\ninternational economic system in crisis, we must devise a\r\nnew and constructive vision, one capable of restructuring\r\nthe world economy while reflecting the interests of both\r\nparties within the framework of sincere cooperation.\r\nWe place our hopes in a renewed United Nations that\r\nwill take concrete action to establish more balanced\r\ninternational economic relations.\r\nIn the opinion of my country, the Federal Islamic\r\nRepublic of the Comoros, cooperation between North and\r\nSouth is vital to the balance of the world economy. The\r\nFederal Islamic Republic of the Comoros also believes that\r\ncooperation between the countries of the South is\r\nimperative; indeed, we have made cooperation with the\r\ndeveloping countries an essential element in our relations.\r\nFor us, the development of South-South cooperation\r\nis a bounden duty in order to insure the continuation and\r\nstrengthening of development assistance. We have chosen\r\na policy of regional solidary and integration as an effective\r\ntool for economic and social progress. Our commitment to\r\nthe Indian Ocean Commission, and our membership in the\r\nAfrican Economic Community, as well as our participation\r\nin the preferential trade area, ZEP, demonstrate the\r\nimportance the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros\r\nattaches to the General Assembly’s recommendations on the\r\nneed for the developing countries to cooperate on a regional\r\nlevel in order to better confront their own problems. It is\r\nin this spirit that our regional institutions have adopted a\r\nstrategy aimed, first and foremost, at strengthening trade\r\nand industrial cooperation, and at improving transportation,\r\ntelecommunications and so forth.\r\nSince the democratic election of His Excellency Mr.\r\nSáíd Mohamed Djohar to the Supreme Magistrature, the\r\nFederal Islamic Republic of the Comoros has committed\r\nitself to working for a democratic, dynamic and open\r\nsociety and to combating corruption, in order to\r\ndefinitively bring about economic and financial recovery.\r\nIn this effort, the Comorian people adopted a new\r\nconstitution and, last December, democratically elected a\r\nnew Parliament composed of all the country’s main\r\npolitical parties.\r\nThe Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros\r\nunderstands that international cooperation alone cannot\r\neradicate the evils of underdevelopment. Thus it has\r\nsigned a programme of structural adjustment with the\r\ninternational financial institutions, with the aim of\r\nachieving economic recovery and of improving public\r\nfinance. It is a trial that the Comorian people is enduring\r\nwith courage and sacrifice. But the recent devaluation of\r\nthe Comorian franc has exacerbated the crisis by seriously\r\nundermining the Comorians’ purchasing power. In such\r\na difficult socio-economic context, how can one convince\r\nstarving people and demoralized State workers that\r\ndemocracy brings hope? The measures taken as a result\r\nof the structural adjustment programmes do not facilitate\r\nthe role the public authorities of a country must play in\r\nthe context of social renewal.\r\nWhile it is true that the easing of international\r\npolitical tension and of certain regional conflicts has\r\nreinforced hopes for peace, the gravity of the international\r\neconomic situation is also creating doubt.\r\nThe victims of the world crisis are still the same:\r\nmen, women and children of the African, Asian, Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean regions.\r\nIndeed, the same people are always the ones who are\r\nconfronted with famine, poverty, natural catastrophes and\r\ndesertification. Other modern scourges such as\r\nfundamentalism, terrorism, epidemics and drug-trafficking\r\nhave been added to an already hostile socio-economic\r\nenvironment. The harsh reality of the poor countries is\r\naccentuated by their exclusion from the decision-making\r\nprocess concerning the international economic situation.\r\nAs the twentieth century draws to a close, the long-\r\ncherished hopes of the third-world peoples are giving way\r\nto disappointment.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly on\r\neconomic cooperation, the Paris Conference on the least\r\ndeveloped countries, the five years of the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\nand many other programmes and projects that have been\r\ndrawn up and carried out over the last 20 years have not\r\nattained the goals set for them by the General Assembly\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nin the area of development. Specialists in development\r\nassistance and economic cooperation are unanimous in\r\nfinding that the current trend is towards stagnation and even\r\nregression.\r\nOur General Assembly must now find a solution to the\r\nproblem created by the failure of international economic\r\nrelations.\r\nWe must insist more strongly on our sense of\r\nsolidarity and shared responsibility.\r\nMy country has always advocated strengthening the\r\nrole of the United Nations in all areas of international\r\nrelations. But it also believes that the structures of the\r\nUnited Nations system must correspond to the new world\r\nscene. We are among those who believe that the victors of\r\nthe Second World War do not have a monopoly on the\r\nmaintenance of peace and on the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of nations.\r\nThe General Assembly must be the central body where\r\nthe relevant decisions of our Organization are taken.\r\nIt is difficult to understand why there is no connection\r\nbetween the political determination expressed here by\r\nStates, the essential components of the protagonists of\r\ninternational life, and the international financial institutions.\r\nOn behalf of His Excellency Mr. Sáíd Mohamed\r\nDjohar, President of the Federal Islamic Republic of the\r\nComoros, and on behalf of the Government and the people\r\nof the Comoros, I should like from this rostrum to make a\r\nsolemn appeal to the international community to provide\r\neffective support to the Comorian people in its efforts at\r\nsocio-economic recovery and in its irreversible commitment\r\nto democracy.\r\nI should like to request that the Security Council\r\nreconsider the sanctions adopted against Libya, because, as\r\na result of sanctions condemning inadmissible acts, an\r\nentire people is being penalized. It is in this spirit that the\r\nrelevant resolutions adopted by the League of Arab States,\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity should be taken into\r\nconsideration, so that this fraternal country may enjoy its\r\nsovereignty.\r\nWe welcome the imminent return of President Aristide\r\nto Haiti. May the peace-keeping operation there bring\r\nstability and security so that Haitians, in their renewed\r\nunity, can work together to rebuild a free and prosperous\r\nnation.\r\nWe also extend these wishes to our brothers in\r\nLiberia, Somalia and Angola, so that, as in Mozambique,\r\nthey may resume dialogue and lay down their weapons.\r\nWe also wish to encourage the Algerian authorities\r\nin their efforts at national reconciliation in the greater\r\ninterest of the Algerian nation.\r\nAccording to several sources, it seems that there has\r\nbeen a significant movement of Iraqi troops towards the\r\nKuwaiti border. We venture to hope that these\r\nmanoeuvers are intended for a purpose other than\r\naggression against Kuwait. Indeed, our Organization will\r\nnever accept a repetition of Iraq’s aggression of 1990.\r\nIt is difficult for us to believe that Iraq has not\r\nlearned the lessons of that famous, much-covered Gulf\r\nwar, from which the Iraqi people, the ultimate victims,\r\nare still healing their wounds.\r\nThe aggression against a sovereign State and the\r\nattack on its territorial integrity are a clear violation of\r\ninternational law. It is an act that goes against the\r\nfundamental principles of the Charter of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThat is why, on behalf of the Government and\r\npeople of the Comoros and in the name of the sacred\r\nprinciples of Islam, I appeal to the Government and\r\npeople of Iraq to halt any attempt to invade Kuwait. It is\r\nup to the Security Council to use all peaceful means to\r\nspare us a second Persian Gulf war. If it does not,\r\nmankind will not be able to understand why each time\r\npeace seems to be established another war looms.\r\nMay I conclude by repeating my delegation’s\r\nfraternal congratulations to the President of the General\r\nAssembly on his election. We are at his complete\r\ndisposal to assist him in any way in his discharge of that\r\nlofty, noble mission.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nnext speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nMarshall Islands, His Excellency Mr. Phillip Muller, on\r\nwhom I now call.\r\nMr. Muller (Marshall Islands): Allow me at the\r\noutset to congratulate the President of the General\r\nAssembly on his unanimous election. It is indeed a great\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nhonour for his country. I can assure him of my\r\ndelegation’s willingness to assist him in his duties.\r\nLet me also congratulate His Excellency Ambassador\r\nSamuel Insanally of Guyana on the exemplary manner in\r\nwhich he carried out his duties. His innovative use of\r\nexpert hearings on the question of development were\r\nfollowed closely by the Marshall Islands delegation.\r\nMy compliments are also extended to our\r\ndistinguished Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr.\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, whom we thank for his tireless\r\nefforts on behalf of this Organization.\r\nOn a more sombre note, I wish to extend the\r\ncondolences of my Government, delegation and people to\r\nour neighbours in the Pacific, Papua New Guinea and\r\nJapan, which have both recently experienced devastating\r\nvolcanic eruptions. Our prayers go out to the peoples of\r\nboth countries in the hope that they will be able to make a\r\nspeedy recovery.\r\nFurther grim descriptions and graphic pictures of the\r\nterrible loss of life on the high seas in the sinking of the\r\n\"Estonia\" have been occupying the air waves and television\r\nscreen. We should like to express our deepest sympathy\r\nand condolences to the affected families and Governments\r\nover this tragic accident.\r\nWe now wish to join other delegations in welcoming\r\nSouth Africa to this Organization. The struggle of its\r\npeople with racial inequality resulting from apartheid was\r\nlong and difficult, often resulting in the loss of precious\r\nlives. We share their excitement in finally joining the\r\nconcert of nations.\r\nWe also wish to congratulate our neighbour the\r\nRepublic of Palau on attaining its independence on 1\r\nOctober this year.\r\nThe aftermath of the cold war has made it necessary\r\nfor the United Nations to take on many challenges. The\r\nOrganization itself has become involved in several\r\nambitious undertakings in innovative international relations\r\nand multilateral actions. We hope that these new\r\nendeavours of partnership will produce lasting solutions to\r\nmany of our global problems.\r\nThat very partnership is evident by the work being\r\nundertaken on the United Nations Framework Convention\r\non Climate Change, which is viewed with great interest in\r\nthe Marshall Islands. Currently, we are working together\r\nwith the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), of\r\nwhich we are a founding member, in introducing a new\r\nprotocol to the Convention. We commend the Chairman\r\nof the Alliance of Small Island States for her coordinating\r\nwork in the International Negotiating Committee. In\r\naddition, we welcome the urgent call made by the\r\nGerman Foreign Minister for more immediate reductions\r\nin carbon dioxide emissions. The German Government’s\r\nsupport for the AOSIS protocol is most gratifying. We\r\nhope that the Conference of the Parties will adopt the\r\nproposed protocol to the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change on Greenhouse Gas\r\nEmission Reduction next year in Berlin.\r\nAs an island nation, the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands regarded the adoption by the General Assembly at\r\nits forty-eighth session, earlier this year, of the Agreement\r\nrelating to the Implementation of Part XI of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea as historic and\r\nof great importance. We view this Agreement as a\r\npositive step in bringing order to the exploitation of\r\nmarine resources. In this vein I am happy to announce\r\nthat we will sign that Agreement at this session. We are\r\nalso happy to note the imminent entry into force of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, in\r\nNovember this year.\r\nIn the months leading up to the Barbados\r\nConference last April, we were very confident that at last\r\nthe international community would try to do something\r\npositive for the small island developing States, a group of\r\ncountries that we feel has been neglected. We are\r\npleased that we now have a Programme of Action, and\r\nwe will do our utmost to seek its successful\r\nimplementation to enhance our island economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs a country with one of the highest population\r\ngrowth rates in the world, the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands has followed with great interest the International\r\nConference on Population and Development. It was a\r\nshame that this process was nearly derailed by semantic\r\ndisagreements. Fortunately, the Conference, in Cairo,\r\nafter arduous and intensive negotiations, saw fit to adopt\r\nan expanded international population strategy, as a result\r\nof which we now have a well-thought-out Plan of Action.\r\nIt is of concern to us that so much of the cost involved in\r\nthe implementation of the Plan of Action will be borne by\r\nindividual countries. We will, however, make every\r\neffort to maximize our participation in this Plan of\r\nAction.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks recently\r\ncompleted its third round of discussions here in New York.\r\nWe all owe a great deal to its distinguished Chairman for\r\nhis masterful stewardship. For the Marshall Islands, this\r\nConference is particularly important as we seek to build our\r\ncapacity to utilize our marine resources responsibly. Unlike\r\ndistant-water fishing nations, our geographical location\r\ncompels us to ensure the sustainable exploitation of our\r\nfisheries resources for future generations, whether within or\r\noutside our exclusive economic zone. This is a matter of\r\nsurvival, one that transcends economics.\r\nI submit, however, that large-scale commercial\r\nfisheries are a new concept for our people. That being so,\r\nwe are interested in modern methodologies for the\r\ncommercial exploitation of fisheries resources. We must\r\nfamiliarize ourselves with them. In this regard, the active\r\nassistance of the developed countries is needed to train our\r\npeople in the modern techniques of commercial fishing. In\r\nthis context, it is essential that we gain preferential access\r\nto international markets. We have brought this matter up\r\nmany times, and we urge the Assembly to promote trade as\r\nwell as training. While we are not asking for much, we do\r\nhope that assistance for self-help will continue to be\r\nforthcoming.\r\nThe development of human resources is probably the\r\nmost important factor in improving the economic situation\r\nin the Marshall Islands. We are grateful to New Zealand\r\nand to the current Chairman of the South Pacific Forum -\r\nAustralia - for their efforts in this field. We encourage\r\nothers to follow their example. Thus, together with other\r\nForum countries, we will aspire to develop a strategy that\r\nwill prepare the way for the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nWe recognize that further improvement of our\r\nrelationships with the various United Nations agencies in\r\nour region is essential. Furthermore, because of their\r\nincreased responsibilities and workloads, we would\r\nencourage an increase in the number of representatives of\r\nthe United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme in the region, and we would also\r\nsupport an increase in their funding.\r\nI also wish to associate myself with my colleagues\r\nfrom the region regarding the application by the South\r\nPacific Forum for observer status at the United Nations. I\r\nurge the General Assembly to seriously consider this\r\nrequest, as it would be of great value to our region\r\ninasmuch as it would strengthen our ties to the United\r\nNations.\r\nOf equal importance is the World Conference on\r\nWomen in Beijing next year. As a matrilineal society, we\r\nhave long recognized the wisdom of including women in\r\nour decision-making process, and we look forward to\r\nparticipating in the Beijing Conference.\r\nDuring the World Hearings on Development earlier\r\nthis year, many of the expert witnesses spoke of the high\r\nproportion of United Nations expenditures earmarked for\r\npeace-keeping, much to the detriment of overall\r\ndevelopment efforts. This is a matter of ongoing concern\r\nto the Marshall Islands as well as to several other small\r\ncountries. We feel that the sheer number and cost of\r\nthese operations are getting out of hand. The preservation\r\nof global peace is of the utmost importance, but in\r\nrelative terms the costs that fall on smaller developing\r\nStates is very large. The Marshall Islands will actively\r\nparticipate in this matter in the Fifth Committee, and we\r\nhope to work together with others for a more equitable\r\napportionment of expenses and assessed contributions.\r\nWe are fully supportive of the views put forward by the\r\nPresident of Latvia regarding the concept of the \"capacity\r\nto pay\".\r\nThe people of the Marshall Islands regard with\r\nabhorrence the numerous human rights abuses that are\r\noccurring around the world. We shall be very vigilant in\r\nthe discussions following on the Vienna Declaration on\r\nthis matter. We believe there is no statute of limitations\r\nto human rights abuses, as clearly they are crimes against\r\nhumanity. The prevalent lack of common decency, which\r\nthe President of Bosnia and Herzegovina so painfully\r\ndescribed in his recent address, must be eradicated.\r\nWe note that His Excellency President Boris Yeltsin\r\nof the Russian Federation stated that the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations should also\r\ncommemorate the victims of the Second World War. My\r\ndelegation fully supports this concept, particularly since\r\nthe fate of many Pacific Island people during the Second\r\nWorld War remains an unwritten chapter in the history\r\nbooks. For example, the atrocities carried out against the\r\npeople of Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands have not been\r\nfully addressed. We trust that moral restitution will be\r\nmade to the memory of these victims.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nThe consequences of recent geo-political events have\r\namply demonstrated the need for the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council. With 184 Members, the United Nations\r\nmust ensure that the Security Council reflects the realities\r\nof the changed situation. My delegation supports the\r\nproposal for increased membership. Moreover, there is an\r\nacute need for increased transparency in the work of the\r\nCouncil. In this context, it is appalling to note that the\r\nSecurity Council, whose decisions affect all Members, does\r\nnot involve more States in its decision-making process. As\r\na positive remedial solution, the suggestion by the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of New Zealand in this regard is of\r\ngreat significance and should be considered.\r\nI should like to remind the members of the General\r\nAssembly of the continued presence in the Marshall Islands\r\nof dangerous residual radioactive contaminants from United\r\nStates nuclear- weapons-testing programmes. Members will\r\nno doubt recall that it was during the relatively brief period\r\nof the United Nations-approved trusteeship that 67 atomic\r\nbombs were detonated on islands that had been inhabited\r\npeacefully and productively by the people of the Marshall\r\nIslands for centuries. This must be regarded as a matter of\r\nmore than historical interest, in view of the resulting legacy\r\nof horrific environmental degradation and tragic human\r\nsuffering - a legacy that threatens to haunt the Marshallese\r\npeople for centuries to come.\r\nDocuments recently declassified and released confirm\r\nthat the full extent of the radioactive contamination\r\nresulting from these tests was not disclosed to the Marshall\r\nIslands by the United States during the negotiation of the\r\nCompact of Free Association. Accordingly, neither the\r\ncompensation provided nor the remedial measures\r\nundertaken or contemplated for the clean-up of some of the\r\ncontaminated islands and the treatment of the affected\r\nhuman population can now be regarded as adequate.\r\nMy Government lacks the huge sums required to\r\nensure the proper clean-up and disposal of the radioactive\r\ncontaminants and the treatment of the radiation-induced\r\nillnesses and birth defects caused by the nuclear-weapons\r\ntests. Notably, the containment facility that was established\r\nfor the radioactive materials gathered from some\r\ncontaminated areas is wholly unsatisfactory by any\r\nreasonable environmental standard.\r\nWhat, then, is my Government to do? We may hope\r\nfor the unreserved cooperation of the former administering\r\nPower in fully cleaning up and disposing of its nuclear\r\nwaste and in adequately aiding our afflicted people.\r\nHowever, as a country that every day continues to suffer\r\nthe consequences of the failure by that Power to meet its\r\nobligations, we must look to such alternatives as we may\r\nfind. In short, we must do more than simply hope.\r\nIt is with this unhappy dilemma in mind that we ask\r\nthe General Assembly to consider sympathetically our\r\nefforts to attend to the restoration of our lands and the\r\ntreatment of our people. The clean-up and disposal of\r\nnuclear contamination in the Marshall Islands will require\r\nvery large sums of money indeed. The effective disposal\r\nof those contaminants will require their permanent\r\nisolation from the human biosphere. An international\r\nfacility on a remote, uninhabited atoll of the Marshall\r\nIslands for the safe, permanent disposal of nuclear\r\nmaterials would, if technically feasible and politically\r\nacceptable, meet these requirements. My Government\r\nwishes it to be understood that such a facility would also\r\nserve the global interest in securing the safe and\r\npermanent disposal of a portion of the world’s dangerous\r\nnuclear materials, an interest that, at present, is by no\r\nmeans accommodated anywhere in the world.\r\nConsequently, my Government has resolved to conduct a\r\npreliminary feasibility study for such a facility and to\r\nconsult closely with interested members of the\r\ninternational community as we proceed.\r\nIn this regard, I wish to commend the remarks made\r\nby the Foreign Minister of Norway in calling on the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to convene an\r\ninternational conference on the management of nuclear\r\nwastes. We look forward with interest to such a\r\nconference, and we pledge our support.\r\nMy Government recognizes that the establishment of\r\na nuclear materials disposal facility in the Marshall\r\nIslands may upon detailed analysis be found to be\r\nunfeasible or otherwise unacceptable. In that event, my\r\nGovernment will look to the Members of this\r\nOrganization for their support in the effort to secure the\r\ncomplete removal from the Marshall Islands of all\r\nresidual radioactive contaminants and of the existing\r\nstorage facility. We expect that the party responsible for\r\nthe radioactive contamination of the Marshall Islands will\r\nprovide the funds and the technical means required to\r\neffect this removal promptly and completely, as well as\r\nto ensure the restoration of all the affected islands to their\r\nfull economic viability. We expect that this Organization,\r\nwhich placed our islands under trusteeship in the first\r\nplace, will ensure that justice prevails.\r\nAt this time, my Government requests the\r\nsympathetic support of the General Assembly as we\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\ncontinue with the effort to secure a commitment to\r\nadequate treatment and full compensation of all the victims\r\nof the nuclear-weapons-testing programme. My\r\nGovernment attaches the utmost importance and immediate\r\nurgency to this matter.\r\nThe issues I have mentioned are of high priority. It is\r\nmy sincere hope that when we gather together next year,\r\nour efforts will indeed have yielded concrete results, visible\r\nand meaningful to our peoples. To accept anything less\r\nwould be a disappointment.\r\nMr. Seydou (Niger) (interpretation from French):\r\nYour election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits forty-ninth session, Sir, is a source of pride for the\r\nwhole diplomatic community, for Africa and for your\r\ncountry, Côte d’Ivoire, and constitutes a just reward for\r\nyour dynamic guidance of your country’s diplomatic\r\nactivities. Those of us who already know your work at the\r\nUnited Nations and at other international meetings can\r\nalready foresee the success of the work of the forty-ninth\r\nsession; we know your enormous talent, wisdom and\r\npatience. Your election also reflects the international\r\ncommunity’s confidence in your country, Côte d’Ivoire, a\r\ncountry with which Niger maintains diversified relations\r\nsolidly rooted in the history and geography of West Africa.\r\nFinally, your election is a posthumous tribute by the\r\ninternational community to the work carried out over half\r\na century by the late President Félix Houphouët-Boigny in\r\nthe service of human dignity, peace and social progress.\r\nPermit me, therefore, to congratulate you, Sir, and through\r\nyou the people of Côte d’Ivoire and its President, Mr. Henri\r\nKonan Bedié, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session.\r\nI wish also to congratulate the other Assembly\r\nofficers; I am sure they will spare no effort to rendering\r\nvaluable assistance as you carry out your tasks.\r\nNiger thanks your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Samuel Insanally, for his tireless work; he fulfilled his\r\nmandate methodically and ably during one of the\r\nOrganization’s busiest years.\r\nI also convey my greetings to the Secretary-General,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and thank him\r\nfor the dynamism and far-sightedness with which he is\r\ncarrying out his mandate in this period of important change;\r\nwe hail him for his firm commitment to international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThe annual convening of the General Assembly\r\ngives Niger the opportunity to renew its faith in the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, signed at San Francisco nearly half a century\r\nago. On 28 September 1993, the President of the\r\nRepublic of the Niger, His Excellency Mr. Mahamane\r\nOusmane, here outlined the views of Niger and its people\r\non the problems of our time. In his statement he stressed\r\nthat the solution to some of those problems lies first and\r\nforemost in the establishment of democracy. Indeed, it is\r\nthrough democracy that mankind will find the path of\r\nfreedom, the path of the love of work and the path of the\r\nshared happiness of citizens.\r\nNiger is firmly committed to this path of democracy;\r\nit has already found the path of freedom for its children.\r\nToday in Niger, no one is molested because of his\r\nphilosophical or religious ideas; since the establishment of\r\nthe Third Republic, freedom of the press is complete and\r\nis guaranteed by the Constitution. Freedom of association\r\ntoo is complete and guaranteed by the Constitution, and\r\na number of political parties, associations and trade\r\nunions now play to the full the role that is properly theirs\r\nin every democratic society.\r\nIt is in that context that the people of Niger is\r\nengaged in rediscovering the path of the love of work,\r\nwhich alone can generate wealth. Many\r\nnon-governmental organizations have been founded and\r\nare working in close cooperation with foreign\r\norganizations.\r\nThe Government of Niger is aware of its\r\nresponsibilities in this area, and is doing everything it can\r\nto ensure that every man and woman of Niger feels fully\r\ninvolved in development issues and can make even a\r\nmodest contribution to building a society founded on\r\nprosperity, justice and freedom.\r\nNiger is a Sahelian country confronted with the\r\ninexorable advance of the Sahara Desert; we welcome the\r\nconclusion at Paris last June of the International\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in those Countries\r\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\r\nparticularly in Africa. Niger invites all Member States to\r\nsign that important Convention so as to permit it to enter\r\ninto force as soon as possible. We hope that the\r\ninternational community will finally be able to act on its\r\ncommitment to give countries suffering from this scourge\r\nthe ability to lay the foundation for genuine, sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nLike other developing countries, Niger is facing\r\nnumerous difficulties, the most important and most\r\nformidable core issue for us is rainfall, whose\r\ncapriciousness is feared by our authorities and our people\r\nalike. Sometimes too meager, sometimes excessive, the\r\nrainy season is an ongoing concern in Niger. Last year\r\nthere was not enough rain; this year, however, there were\r\nrains such as Niger has not witnessed in more than two\r\ndecades. They caused considerable damage but did not\r\ngratify our people or our Government with an adequate\r\nharvest.\r\nNiger wants to free itself from the vagaries of the\r\nheavens in order at last to save its children from hunger\r\nand thirst. That is why our Head of State, His Excellency\r\nMr. Mahamane Ousmane, has initiated a major campaign\r\nin which the people are participating in building the first-\r\never dam on the Niger river.\r\nTo this end he called on all the citizens of Niger to\r\nmobilize the resources needed to build the Kandadji Dam.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I should like to invite all\r\norganizations and countries which wish to aid my country,\r\nto give particular attention to this project. For Niger, this\r\nis a question of ensuring the conditions necessary for the\r\nsurvival of the present and future generations.\r\nMy country has accorded food self-sufficiency top\r\npriority in its campaign for economic development. It\r\nkeenly hopes that with the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity it will achieve this objective before the end of\r\nthe present decade. Here, Niger hopes that the nations\r\nwhich share the same ideal of prosperity and happiness will\r\nextend it the same solidarity.\r\nSince he took office in April 1993, President\r\nMahamane Ousmane has vowed to devote his full energy\r\nto the return of peace in the troubled regions in the north of\r\nour country. He has made that question a constant matter\r\nof concern for the Government of Niger.\r\nBy the grace of God, and following the recent\r\nnegotiations held in Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, the\r\nGovernment of Niger signed a peace agreement with the\r\nCoordination of Armed Resistance, thereby opening the\r\nway for a cease-fire and the drawing up of legislative texts\r\ndesigned to provide more harmonious management of the\r\nregions.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of Niger, allow me here\r\nto extend our warm gratitude to Algeria, Burkino Faso and\r\nFrance, whose mediation made it possible to arrive at this\r\nfortunate conclusion.\r\nThe Ouagadougou Agreement, which was signed\r\nlast Sunday, 9 October 1994, and which entered into force\r\ntoday, 11 October 1994, will allow the people of Niger to\r\ndevote itself to the critical issues of development in a\r\ncalm atmosphere. It opens the way to national\r\nreconciliation among the sons of the same geographical\r\nregion, united by history and inspired by the same will -\r\nthat of living together.\r\nThe Government of Niger will, for its part, engage\r\nin implementing this Agreement by submitting a draft law\r\nto the National Assembly as soon as possible.\r\nIt hopes that the international community will assist\r\nby providing material and financial resources to ensure\r\nthe return and integration of the refugees.\r\nNiger is also expecting consistent support from the\r\ninternational community to ensure its economic recovery.\r\nThus, since the devaluation of the CFA franc, my\r\nGovernment has been continuing negotiations with the\r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\r\nIt has concluded an agreement with the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions on economic recovery, and\r\nnegotiations are now under way for the conclusion of an\r\nagreement on the facility for strengthened structural\r\nadjustment. The Government of Niger has taken the\r\nnecessary preliminary measures to ensure that the present\r\nnegotiations lead to the signing of this agreement at an\r\nearly date.\r\nOn the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding\r\nof the United Nations, it is gratifying to be able to note\r\nall that has been accomplished, in particular over the last\r\nfew years, in areas as complex as peace-keeping,\r\ndisarmament, security, the establishment of democracy,\r\nand respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nThe development of the situation in the Middle East\r\nwhich led to the establishment of the Palestinian authority\r\nin Gaza, like the logic of peace and dialogue which now\r\nprevails between Israel and the other Arab countries, is\r\npart of this new dynamic.\r\nWe cannot fail to mention here, with legitimate\r\npride, the process which led to the establishment in South\r\nAfrica of a democratic regime which is being guided with\r\nwisdom and determination by President Nelson Mandela\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nand which has allowed this founding Member of the\r\nOrganization to regain its rightful place in the community\r\nof nations.\r\nHow can we fail to be gratified that President Jean-\r\nBertrand Aristide will soon arrive on Haitian soil after three\r\nlong years in forced exile?\r\nThese are indeed major events which encourage us to\r\nhope that we will see a rapid return of peace wherever it\r\nmay have been shattered or wherever it is threatened.\r\nThe recent negotiations held in New York between\r\nCuba and the United States, the negotiations between the\r\nAmerican and North Korean authorities, as well as the\r\nwithdrawal of the last foreign troops from Germany and\r\nsome of the Baltic States, show how much we have\r\naccomplished in the five years since the collapse of the\r\nBerlin Wall.\r\nThroughout the world - in Africa, in Asia and in\r\nAmerica and in Europe - the last vestiges of the cold war\r\nare fading away to open the way for a fruitful partnership\r\namong nations.\r\nThe United Nations has made its contribution to the\r\nachievement of this new atmosphere but here and there\r\nhotbeds of tension continue to exist which attest to the\r\nfragility of the present balance.\r\nAmong these conflicts, some of which are ravaging\r\nAfrica, I would mention first of all the conflict in Rwanda,\r\nwhere a fratricidal war has caused the deaths of hundreds\r\nof thousands of men, women and children, left thousands\r\nwounded and sent millions of refugees into exile.\r\nHow can we have allowed such a tragedy to take place\r\nwithout having used all the means and resources available\r\nto the international community in time to prevent, if not\r\nlimit, the unprecedented massacres which were perpetrated?\r\nBecause it is aware that nothing lasting can be\r\nconceived and realized in Rwanda without peace and unity\r\namong its sons Niger made its modest contribution to the\r\nrestoration of peace in Rwanda by participating in the\r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR).\r\nIn this country which has been torn apart, Niger hopes\r\nto see the provisions of the Arusha Agreement enforced so\r\nthat the hardworking people of Rwanda may be able at last,\r\nand once and for all, to turn its attention towards the tasks\r\nof reconstruction and development.\r\nNiger expresses the same hopes for peace and\r\nstability in neighbouring Burundi and welcomes the\r\nsignificant progress made recently, which has resulted in\r\nits acquiring authorities who can pursue the work of\r\nconsolidating the peace.\r\nQuite close to Rwanda, peace is making great strides\r\nalso in a country which has been engaged in war and\r\nsuffering since its independence, namely, Mozambique.\r\nNiger keenly hopes that the changes which took place\r\nrecently in South Africa will have a very positive effect\r\non the elections to be held there on 27 and 28 October.\r\nThe situation in Angola is a matter of concern for\r\nmy delegation. Niger welcomes the fact that, thanks to\r\npressure from the international community and the efforts\r\nmade by President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia and\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela of South Africa and thanks\r\nalso to the joint actions of the special representatives of\r\nthe Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, UNITA has finally agreed\r\nto the signing of a peace agreement, a prelude to a\r\ngeneral cease-fire and the establishment of a lasting peace\r\nin Angola.\r\nNor must the international community and, in\r\nparticular, the United Nations turn its attention away from\r\nSomalia, that other fraternal country that has been\r\nravaged. Indeed, it must do all in its power to maintain\r\na significant United Nations presence, which alone can\r\nguarantee lasting peace in Somalia.\r\nThe process of settling all these conflicts has\r\nrevealed the need for greater coordination between the\r\nefforts of the United Nations and those of the regional\r\norganizations within the framework of safeguarding peace\r\nand international security.\r\nNiger thanks all the countries which, on a bilateral\r\nbasis, made their valuable contribution to the resolution\r\nof certain African conflicts and appeals to the\r\ninternational community for continuing support for the\r\nmachinery of prevention - machinery established by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity for the management and\r\nsettlement of conflicts - to allow it to be more\r\noperational.\r\nMy country is gratified that, after 46 years of\r\nhostilities, Jordan and Israel agreed to sign a peace\r\nagreement on 25 July 1994 - this less than a year after the\r\nsigning of the agreement between the Israelis and the\r\nPalestinians.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nNiger hopes that the logic of peace which has been\r\nestablished in this region will lead to the signature of\r\nsimilar agreements between Israel and Lebanon on the one\r\nhand and between Syria and Israel on the other, so that\r\nonce and for all fraternity will prevail between the sons of\r\nthis part of the world, the cradle of centuries-old\r\ncivilizations.\r\nNiger thus appeals to the Iraqi authorities to ensure\r\nthat the actions they undertake fit within the spirit and letter\r\nof the Security Council resolutions, that they recognize the\r\ninternational borders of Kuwait and refrain from any action\r\nlikely once again to inflame the Gulf region in a fratricidal\r\nconflict with incalculable consequences.\r\nClearly, the world today has gone from a period of\r\nconfrontation to one of cooperation.\r\nIt is clear that our Organization over the years, with its\r\npresent membership of 184 States, is aspiring towards the\r\nideal of universalism enshrined in its Charter. However, it\r\nis up to the United Nations to devote particular attention to\r\nother regions and other peoples which, through their vitality\r\nand economic dynamism, could also contribute to the\r\nimplementation of the ideals of the Charter.\r\nIt is moreover in this spirit that Niger regrets that the\r\nGeneral Assembly was not able to put on its agenda the\r\nitem entitled \"Consideration of the exceptional situation of\r\nthe Republic of China in Taiwan in the international\r\ncontext, based on the principle of universality and in\r\naccordance with the established model of parallel\r\nrepresentation of divided countries at the United Nations\".\r\nNiger is keenly concerned at the continuation of the\r\nconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina despite the efforts and\r\nthe patience of the member countries of the Contact Group\r\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the\r\nnumerous resolutions of the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and the many actions undertaken by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe most recent events in this conflict have\r\ndemonstrated to those who still had doubts that the war in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is deliberate and is supported by\r\nthe leaders of the Serbian community who have made force\r\nthe primary basis for their actions.\r\nThat is why, while welcoming the political courage\r\ndemonstrated throughout this crisis by President\r\nIzetbegovic, Niger supports the proposals which he made\r\nhere on 27 September of lifting the arms embargo which is\r\npreventing Bosnia and Herzegovina from exercising its\r\nright to legitimate self-defence in accordance with the\r\nCharter of the Organization.\r\nAt the risk of seeing many States lose their faith in\r\nthe system of collective security, the Security Council\r\nshould make the Serbs respect the relevant resolutions\r\nwhich it has adopted. It is high time for the Security\r\nCouncil to take the measures required by the situation\r\nconcerning the Serbian aggressors.\r\nThe end of the cold war and of the East-West\r\nconflict has not yet fully liberated mankind from all its\r\nanguish; nor has it allowed it to remove the heavy\r\nburden posed by the build-up and improvement in arms.\r\nWhile it is true that risks of armed confrontation between\r\nthe super-Powers have today disappeared allowing\r\nunimaginable progress in the area of disarmament, this\r\nhas not led to that strengthening of security which we\r\nwere entitled to expect.\r\nA producer of uranium, Niger has ratified the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and will\r\nsupport, during the negotiations to take place next year,\r\nits extension and the universal nature it must acquire.\r\nThe signing last year in Paris of the chemical\r\nweapons Convention, as well as the unilateral\r\nmoratoriums proclaimed by the nuclear Powers are today\r\nalso important constructive steps.\r\nOther efforts should also be made to control\r\nconventional weapons and, in a general fashion, to\r\nestablish confidence-building measures among States.\r\nIt is indeed horrendous to see colossal sums\r\nabsorbed in the manufacture of ever-more sophisticated\r\nweapons of destruction and in mortgaging the security of\r\nouter space while in vast regions of the world millions of\r\nmen, women and children are languishing in the most\r\nabject misery, engaging in a daily battle against hunger\r\nand illness. How many savings could have been made\r\nfrom the resources allotted to peace-keeping if the\r\nminimum had been allotted to development?\r\nI am tempted to say here: give economic and social\r\ndevelopment that which is its due and there will be less\r\nto worry about concerning peace.\r\nIndeed, as you so eloquently pointed out on 20\r\nSeptember last after your election, Mr. President, the\r\neconomic and social situation at the international level is\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nexperiencing alarming developments marked by the stamp\r\nof uncertainty and adversity for the developing countries,\r\nand for Africa in particular.\r\nIn the course of this century that is coming to an end,\r\nmankind has experienced unprecedented turns that improved\r\nthe conditions of the lives of individuals. However, in\r\nseveral regions of the world peace is threatened not by\r\narmed men but by millions of hungry human beings in\r\ndistress who see no prospects for improvement of their\r\nliving conditions.\r\nIn this regard, Africa for two decades now has seemed\r\na desperate case, despite its abundant natural wealth. To be\r\nsure, progress has been made economically and socially,\r\nbut in comparison with the rest of the world such progress\r\nseems insignificant, and in certain respects entire areas have\r\nbecome settled in a situation of non-development.\r\nThus, while certain countries in Asia are experiencing\r\nexpansion with trends of accelerated growth, Africa’s\r\neconomic prospects continue to remain mediocre. Today,\r\nmore than 350 million Africans are living in abject poverty,\r\nmore than half of them women and children.\r\nParadoxically, Africa also shows the signs of a vibrant\r\ncontinent capable of the greatest economic prowess, as long\r\nas the international community gives it the opportunity and\r\nthe means to achieve its potential.\r\nIndeed, how can we speak of a continent on its way\r\nto ruin when along with its natural resources Africa has a\r\nyoung generation determined to meet the challenges of\r\nhistory? How can one sideline Africa when its contribution\r\nto the global economy throughout past centuries has\r\nallowed for the industrialization of the other continents?\r\nHere the industrialized countries bear a heavy\r\nresponsibility. I should like to recall Niger’s position on a\r\nparticular aspect of this responsibility, namely, the debt. As\r\nlong as the developing countries, and in particular those of\r\nsub-Saharan Africa, continue to devote the greater part of\r\ntheir income to paying off the foreign debt they will never\r\nbe able to lay down the basis for a genuine economic\r\nrecovery. Thus, Niger urges the developed countries to\r\ncancel the debts of the developing countries and if\r\nnecessary to give priority to the least developed countries.\r\nIn so doing the industrialized countries will have answered\r\ntheir own appeal as made by the Group of Seven most\r\nhighly industrialized countries at the Naples Summit in July\r\n1994.\r\nAlong with the debt the continued deterioration of\r\nthe terms of trade is a subject of great concern for Niger.\r\nThe purchase price of the products these countries offer\r\non the international market is falling year by year while\r\nthe prices of manufactured products which the same\r\ncountries are buying are continuing to rise.\r\nTo be competitive, some of these countries have\r\ndevalued their currency by half, despite the difficult\r\neconomic, social and political consequences. Quite\r\nrecently in Morocco the developing countries renewed\r\ntheir faith in the rules governing international trade\r\nthrough their active participation in the agreement\r\nestablishing the World Trade Organization. We hope\r\nthat, in return, this organization will be able to fill the\r\ngaps in the text of the agreement by taking courageous\r\ndecisions and adopting measures in favour of the\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular those of Africa.\r\nFor many of the developing countries international\r\ntrade is, first of all, trade in commodities. That is why\r\nNiger attaches great importance to the establishment of\r\nthe commodifies Fund and, in so doing, appeals\r\ndiversification to those countries still reluctant to do so to\r\nbecome involved in the dynamic process under way in\r\nthis area.\r\nBut what the developing countries, and especially the\r\nleast-developed countries, need most is the establishment\r\nof a genuine fund for development assured of lasting\r\nresources. It is recognized today that the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions have reached their limits in development\r\nmatters. The conditions attached to World Bank and\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) loans are often a\r\ngenuine impediment to attaining the developing countries’\r\npurpose in negotiating the loan agreements.\r\nIn his report \"An Agenda for Development\", the\r\nSecretary-General rightly notes that peace is the\r\ndevelopment; the economy is the engine of progress; the\r\nenvironment is a basis for sustainability; and social justice\r\nis a pillar of society.\r\nMy delegation hopes that the consultations to be held\r\non this document will result in a fleshing-out of the initial\r\noutline and that the final report will take into account the\r\nvital concerns of the developing countries. We hope that\r\nit will put forward concrete ways and means to ensure\r\nimplementation of the development programmes and\r\nstrategies adopted by the General Assembly over the last\r\nfew years.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nThe forthcoming major international conferences - the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women and the Second United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements - provide opportunities\r\nfor us further to enrich this Agenda.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reaffirm Niger’s faith in the\r\nideals of the United Nations and in its ability to find,\r\nthanks to the solidarity of all its Members, the right\r\nanswers to the new challenges we face.\r\nMr. Legwaila (Botswana): The Government and\r\npeople of Botswana salute your elevation to the Presidency\r\nof the forty-ninth session of the Assembly. Your election by\r\nacclamation is a fitting tribute not only to your personal\r\ndistinction but also to the African continent, on whose soil\r\nyou were bred and nurtured. It goes without saying,\r\ntherefore, that the confidence we repose in you as you\r\nguide our deliberations is beyond measure.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s legendary tenacity of purpose\r\nat the helm of our Organization has continued to serve us\r\nvery well indeed. He remains undaunted by the\r\ncomplexities of the problems he faces as the world’s chief\r\ndiplomat and peacemaker in an era marred by the\r\ncontinuing absence of peace. We salute him and his staff of\r\ndedicated international civil servants.\r\nLet me also pay a deserved tribute to our dear brother,\r\nlast year’s President, Ambassador Samuel Insanally, whose\r\ntenure of office was most effective, productive and creative.\r\nWe wish him a happy, hard-earned retirement from the\r\nservice of our General Assembly.\r\nThe new world order remains a misnomer. Misery and\r\nwretchedness are the order of the day in many parts of the\r\nworld. The post-cold war era was to be the era of\r\ndemocratization, peace and development, so we hoped. Yes,\r\ndemocratization has taken root in many parts of the world,\r\nincluding our own continent, Africa. That is to be\r\ncelebrated, and should be celebrated. Unfortunately, the\r\nenergies and resources that the international community\r\ncould be deploying to help buttress and nurture emerging\r\ndemocracies have to be expended on the search for\r\nsolutions to a multiplicity of intractable civil wars.\r\nTragically, some of these civil wars show no sign of\r\namenability to solutions. They have become perennial; so\r\nis the United Nations mission to mitigate them. This places\r\nthe United Nations in a terrible dilemma, both moral and\r\nmaterial. Unfortunately, there is very little choice for our\r\nOrganization. It would be absolutely unconscionable to\r\nabandon a Bosnia or a Somalia to its own wretched\r\ndevices.\r\nNevertheless, there is no doubt that the United\r\nNations peacekeeping commitments are threatening to\r\noverwhelm the Organization’s capacities. Financial\r\nresources to sustain these commitments may soon dry up,\r\nif indeed they are available, in tandem with the drying up\r\nof support for peace-keeping generally, particularly\r\namong the big contributors.\r\nThe past year has been a year of mixed blessings for\r\nAfrica. The continent won a major victory with the\r\nliberation of South Africa from the shackles of apartheid\r\nand racism. Three-and-a-half centuries of white minority\r\ndomination have ended, and the construction of a new\r\nnon-racial society has begun in earnest in South Africa.\r\nWe heartily congratulate all the people of South Africa,\r\nin their racial and cultural diversity, on the wisdom and\r\ncourage they have shown in coming to terms with their\r\ncommon destiny. We welcome the new South Africa into\r\nour midst with open arms.\r\nSouthern Africa, the erstwhile cockpit of conflict,\r\nhas suddenly found salvation and begun the process of\r\nreconstruction and regional cooperation and integration.\r\nSince peace and stability are universal prerequisites for\r\norderly economic and social development, both of which\r\nwe have begun to savour in southern Africa, there is\r\nevery reason why we should be excited about the future\r\nof our region.\r\nWith the holding of multiparty elections in the sister\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, the process of democratization\r\nin the region will have come closer than ever before to\r\nculmination. Increasingly, the region is being guided in\r\nthe ordering of its political affairs by a set of common\r\ndemocratic values. Through the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community’s economic fraternity,\r\nmechanisms are being developed to promote regional\r\napproaches to the protection of human rights and the\r\nsafeguarding of the democratic milieu that the region has\r\nlaboured so hard and shed so much blood to bring about.\r\nAs an example, I would mention the case of\r\nLesotho, about which members will have heard.\r\nRecently, when democracy was placed in danger there,\r\nthe region, through the good offices of three Presidents of\r\nsouthern African countries - Zimbabwe, South Africa and\r\nBotswana - sprang into action to engage the Basotho\r\nleaders in a dialogue, which happily culminated in the\r\ncherished Lesotho democracy being saved without a shot\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nbeing fired. It was regional conflict-resolution and\r\ndiplomacy at their very best.\r\nYet we remain troubled and pained by the fact that not\r\nall is well in other parts of the African continent by any\r\nstretch of the imagination. Our south western sister\r\nRepublic of Angola has never had a moment of tranquillity,\r\npeace or stability ever since it attained its independence 19\r\nyears ago. Blood has continued to flow in that tortured\r\ncountry in ever-increasing profusion, even as we are told\r\nthe Lusaka talks are on the verge of a successful\r\nconclusion. This is the precious blood of innocent Angolans\r\nshed needlessly because the multiparty democracy\r\ndemanded by UNITA and its supporters was won three\r\nyears ago, only to be subjected to another round of brutal\r\ncivil war. We remain hopeful, however, that the marathon\r\ntalks in Lusaka, capital of the Republic of Zambia, will\r\nproduce an agreement for the parties to implement without\r\nreservation.\r\nThe Somali tragedy remains intractable. The presence\r\nin the fractured country of 18,000 United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping troops, including Botswanans, has not made much\r\nof a difference in the restoration of peace and tranquillity\r\nto the Somali people.\r\nNow we are faced with a threat to abandon the\r\ncountry to its fate. The international community has every\r\nreason to be frustrated and exasperated by what looks like\r\na total absence of any intention on the part of the warring\r\nSomali factions to reconcile and give their nation a chance\r\nto drag itself out of the quagmire of civil war. We\r\nunderstand this frustration and exasperation, and yet we\r\nwould find it absolutely unconscionable for the United\r\nNations simply to uproot itself from Somalia when it is\r\nabundantly clear that such a course of action would have\r\ncatastrophic consequences. The decision to withdraw the\r\nUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) must\r\nbe carefully weighed against the obvious consequences of\r\nthe vacuum it will create.\r\nThere is also Liberia, whose agony clearly knows no\r\nlimit. The madness that is being displayed by the warring\r\nfactions there is surely beyond comprehension. Is the\r\nnewly intensified fighting which has caused another exodus\r\nof refugees to neighbouring countries and wasted more\r\ninnocent lives the way to thank the monitoring Group of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOMOG)\r\nand the international community for the cost in lives and\r\nmaterial they have suffered and incurred in an attempt to\r\nsave Liberia from self-destruction? The first world is\r\nalready showing signs of extreme weariness about the cost\r\nof peace-keeping. Soon even ECOMOG may run out of\r\nthe means and the will to persist in its seemingly\r\nimpossible mission to save Liberia from itself. And as\r\nlong as Liberia is in the state in which it is there is the\r\ncertainty that peace in the region at large will be and\r\nremain imperilled.\r\nAlthough the carnage has ended in Rwanda, the\r\ntragedy that has befallen its people has not. The\r\nRwandese nation cannot reconcile so long as chunks of it\r\nare languishing and dying in refugee camps in foreign\r\nlands. Rwanda cannot endure any more cycles of civil\r\nwar and genocidal massacres. The tens or hundreds of\r\nthousands of refugees encamped at present in the\r\nneighbouring countries must be helped to return to their\r\nhomeland lest out of the frustrations of exile in their\r\nsqualid refugee camps they ignite another cycle of\r\ngenocide.\r\nOn the perennial question of Western Sahara,\r\nBotswana shares the view that it is taking far too long to\r\nhold a referendum in the Territory to allow the Sahraoui\r\npeople to decide their future. The Territory cannot and\r\nmust not be allowed to mark time forever in a limbo of\r\nuncertainty as if the fulfillment of the aspirations of its\r\npeople can be delayed until their final submission.\r\nBeyond the African continent, the agony of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina has continued to outrage the conscience\r\nof mankind. The senseless bloodletting in that tormented\r\nregion of Europe remains stubbornly impervious to\r\nsolution. Peace plan after peace plan has failed to\r\nimpress one side or the other, and the result is that the\r\npatience of the international community, which has to\r\ndeploy enormous resources to maintain a massive\r\npeace-keeping presence in the area, is being tested beyond\r\nendurance. The question we ask is: How can the\r\nperpetrators of that cruel conflict ever make sense out of\r\nit? We appeal to them to stop the carnage. Meanwhile,\r\nwe urge the International Tribunal set up to bring to\r\njustice the authors and perpetrators of that barbarous war\r\nto spare no effort in doing so.\r\nWe hope that in the Caribbean, the people of Haiti\r\nwill take advantage of the massive assistance they are\r\nreceiving from the international community to normalize\r\nthe situation in their country. They have a golden\r\nopportunity to do so and to resume the journey they\r\nstarted three years ago towards a democratic future.\r\nThere may be no second - or third - chance.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nBotswana believes that the time has come for Cuba\r\nand the United States to negotiate an amicable end to their\r\nprotracted estrangement. Intractable problems all over the\r\nworld, are being resolved through negotiations, and we do\r\nnot believe that the cold war between Cuba and the United\r\nStates is beyond resolution by negotiation. Botswana\r\nvalues the friendship of both countries and cherishes the\r\nhope that soon there will be peace and reconciliation\r\nbetween the two neighbours.\r\nThe Middle East has broken out of the straitjacket of\r\nno war- no peace. We hail the agreement clinched last year\r\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\n(PLO) and the rapprochement between Israel and Jordan\r\nsymbolized by the signing of the Washington Declaration\r\nto bring to an end the state of war between the two\r\ncountries, and we urge that no stone be left unturned in the\r\nquest for a comprehensive solution to the problems of that\r\nvery important area of the world.\r\nUnfortunately, the sound of the drums of war in the\r\nGulf area are piercing our ears once again. We hope that\r\nthis time the parties involved in the war dance are merely\r\ntrying to exorcise the demons of the politics of\r\nbrinkmanship, without any intention whatsoever of bringing\r\nworld peace to the brink and beyond.\r\nThe arbitrary division of the island of Cyprus remains\r\nunrepaired. We urge the parties to reintensify their search\r\nfor a mutually acceptable dispensation that will make\r\npossible the reunification of the island and its people.\r\nThe same applies to the two Koreas. The people of\r\nthe North and South are Koreans in every sense and soon\r\nthey must realize that, like the people of South Africa, who\r\nhave just triumphed over racial division, they too can\r\ntriumph if they try harder, over ideological division.\r\nWe live in the age of dialogue and negotiation, the age\r\nof reconciliation and forgiveness. No one will be excused\r\nfor refusing to negotiate an end to a disagreement.\r\nOver the past two decades my country has experienced\r\nan unprecedented period of economic growth. Between\r\n1970 and 1992 Botswana achieved an annual real growth\r\nrate of 12 per cent per year in gross domestic product.\r\nAfter being viewed as one of the world’s poorest countries,\r\nwith a per capita income estimated at $70, Botswana\r\nsuddenly became Africa’s success story, a success born out\r\nof a stable, democratic political system and a free-market\r\neconomy. Our democratic system is now so entrenched\r\nthat it has become our nation’s second nature. The happy\r\nresult is that Botswana is free from any ethnic or tribal\r\nconflict.\r\nRegrettably, we have not been spared the wrath of\r\nthe world recession and have thus experienced dramatic\r\ndeclines in growth rates. Our economic growth, heavily\r\ninfluenced by the development of minerals, particularly\r\ndiamonds, has experienced adverse effects arising from\r\nthe fall in the price of diamonds. Our country has\r\nentered the most challenging period since independence.\r\nAfrica as a whole is engaged, in one form or\r\nanother, in economic and political reforms that need the\r\nsupport and cooperation of the donor community and the\r\nmultilateral financial institutions. Poverty is an\r\nunderlying factor of underdevelopment that many African\r\ncountries have to contend with today. Regrettably,\r\nimplementation of the structural adjustment programme,\r\nwelcome as it is in the restructuring of African\r\neconomies, has in many instances worsened the social\r\nconditions of the poor in the short term. This is why\r\nBotswana looks forward to the forthcoming World\r\nSummit on Social Development, where we will have the\r\nopportunity to address these anomalies in a very serious\r\nmanner.\r\nBotswana is encouraged by the ongoing process of\r\nreform and revitalization of the United Nations in the\r\neconomic, social and related fields. The adoption of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 48/162 has brought about\r\nunprecedented changes in the working of the United\r\nNations system, at the level both of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and of the Second Committee of the\r\nGeneral Assembly; we welcome all of this. It is our hope\r\nthat these changes will bring about efficiency and\r\neffectiveness in addressing the needs and concerns of\r\ndeveloping countries at the policy-making and operational\r\nlevels.\r\nWith regard to reform of the Security Council, I can\r\ndo no better than quote the African Common Position\r\nPaper on United Nations Reforms:\r\n\"The expansion and equitable representation in the\r\nSecurity Council has become imperative because of\r\nthe need to democratize and make the Council more\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 11 October 1994\r\nefficient and transparent. In this era, the democracy\r\nthat is being preached at national level should pervade\r\nthe international system. It is thus necessary to review\r\nboth the composition and the decision-making process\r\nof the Council, in line with the above principles, and\r\ntaking into account the relationship between the\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly. In implementing\r\nthese ideals, it is necessary to bear in mind the need\r\nfor equitable geographical representation, which\r\nemphasizes increased permanent membership for\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa.\"\r\nWe are due to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of this Organization. The United Nations has\r\namply vindicated its existence. It survived the distractions\r\nand ravages of the cold war with its sense of purpose\r\nrelatively intact. Botswana’s fidelity to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Organization’s Charter remains unstinting.\r\nIt is therefore our cherished hope that the next century will\r\nusher in an environment in which the Organization will\r\nthrive in the pursuit of these purposes and principles.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.55 p.m.\r\n33\r\n"
