(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The first\r\nspeaker is the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of\r\nGuinea-Bissau, His Excellency Mr. Marcelino Lima, on\r\nwhom I now call.\r\nMr. Lima (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\ninterpretation from French text furnished by the\r\ndelegation): Allow me first of all, Sir, to congratulate you\r\nwarmly on your noteworthy election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Your presence,\r\ndear brother, at the head of the Assembly is clear proof of\r\nthe commitment of your country, Côte d’Ivoire, to the\r\ndefence of international ideals and the promotion of\r\nmultilateral diplomacy. Furthermore, your personal\r\ncompetence and the rich diplomatic experience you have\r\nacquired over the years are a guarantee of the success of\r\nour deliberations. My country, Guinea-Bissau, which holds\r\none of the vice-presidencies, wishes to assure you of its\r\ntotal availability and fullest cooperation.\r\nOur thanks and congratulations also go to your\r\nillustrious predecessor, Mr. Samuel Insanally, for the\r\nwisdom with which he guided the work of the forty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nWe would also like to express our congratulations to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to\r\npay him a tribute for his tireless activity in the midst of\r\nso many dramatic events.\r\nThe general debate of the forty-ninth session reflects\r\nthe logic of the post-cold-war period, in which the burden\r\nof blocs, ideological confrontations and threats of nuclear\r\nhas been lightened, thus creating favourable conditions for\r\na new type of relationship between nations and peoples.\r\nThe political and socio-economic changes that have\r\ntaken place on the international scene undoubtedly will\r\nhave repercussions on the structure and functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nCreated 49 years ago, the United Nations has long\r\nlived in the context of the bipolarization of blocs and of\r\nideologies. Today more than ever, our Organization is\r\ncalled upon to face the challenges of international politics\r\nin a different way.\r\nThe positive trend emerging on the international\r\nlevel thanks to joint efforts by many parties to preserve\r\nthis trend is nonetheless being thwarted by various\r\nhotbeds of tension and conflict in different regions of the\r\nworld.\r\nGuinea-Bissau, aware of this fact and of its harmful\r\nconsequences, is firmly committed to the promotion of a\r\nnew international conscience, based on respect for human\r\nvalues.\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nThe United Nations, in order to better respond to the\r\nrequirements of our times, must take these new challenges\r\ninto account and thus undertake the necessary reforms.\r\nThe universally hailed end of bipolarization in\r\ninternational relations has brought about a rebirth of hope\r\nfor a new era of peace. Alas, the world is still the theatre\r\nof tragic and unforeseeable events.\r\nThe African continent is one of the regions of the\r\nworld that is most affected. Drought and desertification,\r\nwhich bring disorder to that continent, diminish its\r\nproductive capacity and provoke famine, is now being\r\ncompounded by fratricidal wars.\r\nIt is no accident that in the course of recent years\r\nmore than half of the peace-keeping operations of the\r\nUnited Nations have taken place, unfortunately, in Africa.\r\nIn Angola, the people continue to be victims of\r\nsuffering and atrocities. Guinea-Bissau once again urges\r\nthe parties to the conflict to fully respect the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and hopes that the Lusaka talks\r\nwill produce results.\r\nIn Mozambique, significant progress has been\r\nachieved in the efforts to establish a lasting peace. We\r\nrepeat our congratulations to the Government and to the\r\nResistência Nacional Moçambicana, and urge them to\r\npersevere along this road, which should lead to the holding\r\nof multiparty elections in the coming days.\r\nIn Liberia, the situation remains virtually unchanged,\r\ndespite numerous agreements concluded between the parties\r\nconcerned. If it continues, this state of affairs may imperil\r\nthe stability of the subregion.\r\nThe situation in Rwanda and in Somalia continues to\r\nbe of serious concern to my country. We urge all of the\r\nparties concerned to end hostilities in favor of dialogue for\r\nthe achievement of national reconciliation. My Government\r\nwelcomes the international community’s unified actions on\r\nbehalf of these two countries, in particular \"Operation\r\nTurquoise,\" undertaken by France.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Western Sahara, my\r\ncountry’s delegation welcomes the progress achieved and\r\nsupports the efforts of the Secretary-General.\r\nSimilarly, Guinea-Bissau is of the opinion that the\r\nconflicts in the former Yugoslavia must be resolved through\r\npeaceful negotiations.\r\nThe end of apartheid and the holding of the first free\r\nand democratic election in South Africa have turned a\r\npage in the history of that country, which is called upon\r\nto play an important role in Africa and in the world.\r\nThe peace agreement signed between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization, which provides for\r\nmutual recognition by the two parties, and the agreement\r\nbetween Israel and Jordan represent important steps\r\ntoward the creation of lasting peace in the region.\r\nConcerning the question of East Timor, we support\r\nthe continuation of all initiatives undertaken under the\r\nauspices of the Secretary-General with a view to bringing\r\nabout a just and equitable solution.\r\nRegarding Cuba, my country encourages dialogue\r\nbetween the United States and that country to find a\r\nsolution to the question of the embargo, the repercussions\r\nof which have a major impact on the population.\r\nIn the case of Haiti, we are pleased to note that after\r\nmany efforts by the United Nations and the Organization\r\nof American States, the fundamental rights of the Haitian\r\npeople have finally been re-established and democracy\r\nrestored with the return of the constitutionally elected\r\nPresident, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It is appropriate here\r\nto pay tribute to the decisive role played by the United\r\nStates in the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 940 (1994).\r\nRespect for human rights is a factor for peace and a\r\nguarantee of international stability. The full exercise of\r\nindividual rights presupposes the existence of objective\r\nconditions of economic and social organization based on\r\njustice and equity.\r\nThe international community must promote more just\r\nand constructive cooperation between States to combat the\r\nperverse effects of poverty and improve material\r\nconditions in the most needy countries and among the\r\nmost handicapped populations.\r\nWe are pleased at the results achieved by the World\r\nConference on Human Rights and hope that the\r\nresolutions and decisions agreed upon there will\r\ncontribute to the protection and strengthening of human\r\nrights.\r\nLike many preceding speakers, I wish to emphasize,\r\non behalf of Guinea-Bissau, that it is our firm conviction\r\nthat the Republic of China in Taiwan should regain its\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nplace in the United Nations, on the basis of the principles\r\nof parallel representation of divided countries. As a full-\r\nfledged Member of the United Nations, the Republic of\r\nChina in Taiwan, with its 20,000,000 inhabitants and its\r\nhighly advanced stage of economic and technological\r\ndevelopment, could play a preponderant role on the\r\ninternational scene. We hope that at its next session, which\r\nwill coincide with the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the founding of our world Organization, the General\r\nAssembly will decide to put this item on its agenda.\r\nGuinea-Bissau has just carried out multiparty\r\nlegislative and presidential elections, which were considered\r\njust and transparent by our people and by international\r\nobservers. These elections, which showed the good\r\ncitizenship and maturity of the people of Guinea-Bissau,\r\ntook place in a climate of exemplary civilian peace. Our\r\ncountry is firmly committed to the preservation and the\r\ndeepening of pluralistic democracy, a condition sine qua\r\nnon for any type of lasting development.\r\nAs emphasized by His Excellency João Bernardo\r\nVieira, President of our Republic, at his inauguration on 29\r\nSeptember this year, there were no losers in the elections in\r\nGuinea-Bissau. All the people of Guinea-Bissau and our\r\ncountry’s national unity, stability and development were\r\nwinners.\r\nAt this new stage in the history of our country we are\r\nof course counting on our people’s determination, but also\r\non the international community’s support.\r\nWe welcome the success of the Uruguay Round and\r\nthe prospects for international trade that were opened up\r\nwith the signing of the Marrakesh Agreement and the\r\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization. We\r\nbelieve that the achievement of the objectives after more\r\nthan eight years of negotiations, resulting in the Declaration\r\nof Marrakesh, should have beneficial consequences for the\r\ndeveloping countries, thus enabling trade to play its\r\nefficient role as a motor for development.\r\nWe believe that it is urgent to revise the current\r\neconomic order, which strongly penalizes the developing\r\ncountries. Indeed, these countries, and those of Africa in\r\nparticular, are faced with the problems of the outflow of\r\ncapital and the deterioration of the terms of trade, which\r\nseriously compromise the economic and social development\r\nof the countries of the South. This extremely painful\r\nsituation is a significant cause of the developing countries’\r\nexternal indebtedness.\r\nThe external debt of the developing countries in\r\ngeneral and of the African countries in particular remains\r\nan unbearable burden for their economies and a major\r\nobstacle to their development.\r\nGuinea-Bissau, with the support of its principal\r\neconomic partners, is continuing its efforts to find an\r\nappropriate and lasting solution to the debt problem,\r\nwhich has serious consequences for its socio-economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe consider that the Organization should devote\r\nspecial attention to the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Agrica in the 1990s in order to speed\r\nup the process of the socio-economic transformation of\r\nthe continent. Similarly, we support the rapid\r\nimplementation of the \"Agenda for Development\".\r\nThe problem of desertification represents a major\r\nconcern for the Government of Guinea-Bissau, a country\r\nwhich, because it is located in the Sudano-Sahelian\r\nregion, is faced with persistent irregularities in rainfall, as\r\nwell as massive invasions of insects that destroy\r\nagricultural production. In this context, our country\r\nsupports the signing of an international convention to\r\ncombat desertification in those countries experiencing\r\nserious drought and/or desertification, particularly in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe social and economic development activities of\r\nthe United Nations are in our view aimed in particular at\r\nthe most vulnerable groups - women, children, young\r\npeople, the aged and the handicapped. The situation in\r\nwhich the majority of people in the developing world are\r\nnow living deserves special attention from our\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn fact, the solution of the problem lies in a better\r\ndevelopment of North-South cooperation. If there is to be\r\nprogress in the developing countries, health and education\r\nsystems must be upgraded, and machinery must be\r\nestablished to eradicate hunger and poverty and improve\r\nliving conditions in the world.\r\nWe repeat our support for the convening of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development in 1995 and of the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women, as well as the\r\nPreparatory Conference in Dakar and Habitat II.\r\nThe international community is capable of meeting\r\nthe challenges facing it and of resolving complex\r\nproblems. Our Organization has many, sometimes\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\ndifficult, tasks to accomplish. It is our sincere wish that the\r\nprocess of restructuring the United Nations system, so\r\nnecessary for the revitalization of the Organization, can be\r\ncompleted, so that the hopes that prevailed at the founding\r\nof the United Nations will be seen in a new light when we\r\ncelebrate the forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The next\r\nspeaker is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Economic Development and Attorney\r\nGeneral of Belize, His Excellency the Honourable Dean\r\nBarrow, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Barrow (Belize): The delegation of Belize\r\nwarmly congratulates you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. We are proud that such an illustrious son of Africa\r\nhas been selected to preside over our deliberations in this\r\nperiod leading up to the celebration of the Organization’s\r\nfiftieth anniversary year.\r\nPermit me too to express my delegation’s thanks and\r\npraise for the sterling performance of your immediate\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally of\r\nGuyana.\r\nOnce again we gather to review the state of world\r\norder. And of the year just past it might perhaps be said\r\nthat it was the best of times and the worst of times.\r\nOn the one hand, a jubilant South Africa kept its\r\nrendezvous with freedom and now appears to be bathed in\r\nsunlight. Furthermore, the peace in the Middle East,\r\npresaged by the Agreement on Palestinian self-rule, is\r\ntaking root. Tension on the Korean peninsula has eased,\r\nand the cease-fire in Northern Ireland represents a hitherto\r\nunimaginable breakthrough.\r\nOn the other hand, the pall of nuclear weapons still\r\nhangs over our fragile planet. So does the gloom of\r\nconventional armaments, the din of battle and the smell of\r\nrotting flesh in the Balkans, parts of our beloved Africa and\r\nwestern and central Asia. In particular, the scale of the\r\ntragedy in Rwanda has been incomprehensible. The initial\r\nparalysis of will of the world community, our belated\r\nresponse in the face of horrible genocide, has not been our\r\nfinest hour. That hesitation, that failure of leadership,\r\nunderscores the need for the United Nations system’s\r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping\r\nmechanisms to be better developed as a matter of urgency.\r\nThe fact is that there is still rampant lawlessness\r\nabroad on our planet, and we continue to be traumatized\r\nby the death and destruction it brings. In particular, the\r\nliving hell of refugees, fleeing almost inconceivable\r\nconditions of terror, seems to have become a stock feature\r\nof our end-of-the-century international existence.\r\nIn this sort of depressing world political climate,\r\neven small countries such as mine must do what we can\r\nto ease the pain. Thus it was that Belize became the first\r\nsmall State to agree to participate in the multinational\r\nforce currently overseeing the end of tyranny in Haiti.\r\nWe took seriously the Security Council’s particular\r\ninvitation to regional States and hope now that the\r\ncollective response will succeed in giving our beleaguered\r\nsister republic surcease from its unhappy history and a\r\nchance of lasting peace and true democracy. We salute\r\nthe Haitian people and we congratulate President Aristide.\r\nWe expect soon to be able to send our messages of\r\ncongratulations direct to the presidential palace in Port-au-\r\nPrince.\r\nIn Belize’s own neighbourhood, the\r\nredemocratization of the Central American isthmus\r\ncontinues apace. In the last year, the free elections and\r\norderly transitions of power that have taken place in\r\nPanama, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras have\r\nvindicated our new-found, or rather rediscovered, destiny.\r\nIn Guatemala, a plebiscite, congressional elections and the\r\nOslo Agreement between the Government and the Unidad\r\nRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) guerrilla\r\ngroup have strengthened the internal order. Furthermore,\r\nthat country has undertaken, in its letter to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/49/94 of 14 March 1994) to abide by pacific\r\nprinciples and good-neighbourliness in its relations with\r\nmy country. As a Member of this Organization, with our\r\nhistorical and constitutional land and sea borders\r\nuniversally recognized as inviolable in accordance with\r\nthe principles of self-determination, sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity, Belize welcomes this Guatemalan\r\ncommitment. It is a further encouragement to regional\r\npeace.\r\nTalking of peace, we note with interest the\r\ndevelopment of the concept of stand-by forces. This idea\r\nneeds to be deepened and refined, and arrangements\r\nshould be made for appropriate training in regional\r\ntraining centres. In this regard, Belize’s offer to serve as\r\none such locale, making special use of our jungle terrain\r\nand facilities, is a matter of record.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nThis Organization must be allowed to develop an\r\nagency for rapid and effective military deployment. Again,\r\nwe call for the implementation of Article 43 of the Charter.\r\nWhat we are saying is that security and world order\r\nmust be significantly improved. Mankind and the vision of\r\nour founders must be vindicated. In that light, we reiterate\r\nthe call we made during last year’s debate for reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. Since that time, we have refined our\r\nideas on that subject. These include our proposals that\r\ncertain developing countries, on account of sheer population\r\nnumbers and geopolitical realities, should be permanent, or\r\nindefinite, members; that contributions to the peace-keeping\r\nbudget should be a relevant criterion for permanent, or\r\nindefinite, membership; and that, in both existing categories\r\nof membership, adjacent States should be permitted to pool\r\ntheir resources as composite or constituency members. We\r\nnow call upon all the members of this Assembly to ensure\r\nthat, by the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization, we\r\nshall demonstrate our commitment to world order by\r\ndemocratically bringing the Council to a better state of\r\ngrace.\r\nAnother aspect of international order that deserves\r\nmention is that of the number of entities which are not fully\r\nembraced by the notion of universality in our Charter and\r\nwhich do not participate completely in the system of\r\ninternational order. These entities are mostly in or around\r\nthe Asia-Pacific region, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and\r\nthe Caribbean. We call on all parties in good faith to\r\ncontinue their various dialogues to resolve this issue.\r\nTo contribute to this restructuring of world order, we\r\nare in the process of finalizing a massive new economic\r\ndimension with the conclusion of the multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations, the establishment of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, the development of new mechanisms for the\r\nresolution of trade disputes and the deepening and widening\r\nof the system of norms relating to international commerce.\r\nWe applaud the transformation of the General Agreement\r\non Tariffs and Trade and these other advances, while urging\r\nthat the less well-endowed countries receive their due, both\r\nunder domestic jurisdictions and laws and in adjudications\r\nby the new organization. Rampant unilateralism and\r\nprotectionism must now take a back seat. We are satisfied\r\nat the expansion of the institution of non-discrimination into\r\nsuch new areas as trade in services and trade-related\r\ninvestment measures. We are also happy that dumping and\r\nsubsidies regulations have now been significantly improved\r\nand that progress has been made in the trying area of\r\nsafeguards.\r\nWe hope, however, that the thread of liberalism that\r\nruns through these new instruments will not become a\r\nnoose to suffocate those of us that did not inherit a head\r\nstart. We therefore call for sensitivity in the application\r\nof those various provisions for special and differential\r\ntreatment of such countries.\r\nIn the same vein, we would wish for increased\r\nsensitization on the part of the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nEven as the global order swings to and fro, we call for\r\nimprovement of the various mechanisms as they affect\r\nour sensitive economies.\r\nIn Belize we have begun our own adjustment\r\nprocess. This is necessary if we are to cope with the\r\ninitial dislocations to small economies, which will be the\r\ninevitable consequence of the new international trading\r\nrealities. As well, the profligate behaviour of the central\r\nGovernment between September 1989 and June 1993 had\r\nresulted in an unmanageable deficit, precipitously\r\ndeclining reserves and imprudent short-term, high-interest\r\nforeign borrowing.\r\nSo we seek now to restore fiscal discipline and\r\nregain macro-economic stability. We are also intent on\r\nremoving the traditional distortions inherent in the\r\ndomestic trading regime, and on instituting tax reform\r\nthat will eliminate our overreliance on import duties.\r\nThis is a process that we must manage carefully, since\r\ndrastic reductions in public expenditure and trade\r\nliberalization will work initial hardship on our local\r\neconomy. In this context, the Bretton Woods institutions\r\nhave a duty to respond to our special circumstances.\r\nSupport for our public and private sectors must be\r\nforthcoming, for the brave new economic world that we\r\nmust enter, whether voluntarily or otherwise, will no\r\ndoubt prove a most inhospitable clime to those not\r\nclothed with the requisite garb.\r\nIn particular, the funds for skills training, human\r\nresource development and poverty alleviation must be\r\nfound. Our young people are already hostage to the\r\nsubculture of violence perpetrated as much by the\r\ntelevision images transported undiluted from the first\r\nworld, as by the indigenous problems peculiar to our\r\nsmall societies. The hope-extinguishing cycle of\r\nalienation, joblessness and incarceration must be broken.\r\nOtherwise, those nice new economic edifices we are so\r\ncarefully constructing will come crashing to the ground,\r\nundone by the confrontation and social chaos that\r\ncontinued marginalization of our youth will surely\r\nengender.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nWe repeat, then, that small, hitherto hardy,\r\ndemocracies must not now be swamped by a heedless\r\nforward march of soulless economic principles. And the\r\ncase for urgent Bretton Woods social and economic\r\nassistance should be even more compelling in the instance\r\nof voluntary, vis-à-vis imposed, structural adjustment.\r\nWe are somewhat embarrassed that, almost 50 years\r\non, this journey into a putative glorious world order just\r\nnow sees us seriously crafting new substantive agendas for\r\nwhat are really some very old problems. Yet, we must deal\r\nwith reality. The development decades and the new\r\ninternational economic order were, in part, chimeric or\r\nexercises in rhetoric. But I believe we are truly now\r\nengaged in writing a new, coherent, agenda for\r\ndevelopment. Let it be a properly annotated agenda. In\r\nfact, let it be a fully programmed model that entirely\r\nanticipates what lies ahead.\r\nWe are grateful that this Organization is also taking\r\nnote of the unfulfilled promises of the Second World War\r\norder. It is now 53 years since the call for social justice\r\nwent out in the Four Freedoms and the Atlantic Charter.\r\nYet we are far from freedom from want and improved\r\nsocial security. Now, with the recently concluded\r\nConference on Population and Development, and with the\r\nWorld Conference on Women and the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development just before us, the opportunity is here\r\nagain. Let us seize it and develop bold concepts and\r\neffective normative systems. And while we do so, let us\r\ncontinue to develop such recent notions as those relating to\r\nthe relief of children in difficult circumstances. Let us also\r\ndevelop this Organization’s capacity for technical assistance\r\nin crime prevention and interdiction to those United Nations\r\nMembers which are increasingly beset by the scourge of\r\nviolence, weapons and narcotics. These plagues are, almost\r\ninvariably, brought on by demands and excesses imported\r\nfrom thousands of miles away, mostly with the aid of the\r\nelectronic media.\r\nAnother area in which we are still in the agenda stage\r\nis that of humanitarianism. Despite unfair criticism, the\r\nSecretariat has done what it could to carry out the promises\r\nmade in the Charter. We commend all concerned with the\r\nestablishment of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs,\r\nand we pledge to work beside them.\r\nAnother relatively recent watchword is sustainability.\r\nIt has a redolence to which we have all taken with alacrity.\r\nIt warns the well-endowed of the truth of the adage \"Waste\r\nnot, want not\". It reminds the less fortunate to try to\r\nresolve their dilemma wisely, as necessity obliges them to\r\nreduce their woodlands while leaching the present vitality\r\nof the land. It has brought us out of our slumber and\r\nhumbled us into sincere discussions about fish stocks,\r\nfragile low-lying developing small island and coastal\r\nareas, and global warming.\r\nWe have seen the Commission for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and the Global Environment Facility take\r\ntheir faltering first steps. While they are to some extent\r\nfurther examples of the somewhat unstructured way in\r\nwhich the Organization is sometimes obliged to operate,\r\nwe nevertheless commend those agencies. And we\r\nsincerely hope that sustainability will keep us whole.\r\nAnother area in which the Organization has been\r\ndiscovering its role is human rights. We all recently\r\nparticipated in the stimulating exercise of establishing the\r\npost of High Commissioner for Human Rights. We have\r\nseen the number of instruments on that subject increase.\r\nHuman rights bodies have become more experienced and\r\neffective. Even in the field of population and\r\ndevelopment, we notice how the recent Cairo Programme\r\nof Action uses human rights as its main point of\r\ndeparture. It is striking that, in places, that document\r\nalphabetizes the basic species of human rights. So did\r\nthe Assembly’s resolution establishing the post of High\r\nCommissioner. We did this to stress the non-selectivity\r\nand neutrality of the various genres of human rights.\r\nThat is to say, cultural, economic and social rights are as\r\nmuch our concern as civil and political rights. The\r\ncoincidence of development with population and other\r\nconcerns in the Cairo document, and the stress of the\r\nright to development both in the resolution establishing\r\nthe post of High Commissioner and in the Cairo\r\ndocument, underscore the coequal importance of that\r\ncategory of right. I believe that we are now seeing the\r\nbeginning of the concretization of international concern\r\nabout a wider range of human rights for individuals and,\r\nI beg to stress, groups and peoples.\r\nAbove all, these recent developments in the field of\r\nhuman rights, sustainable development and social justice\r\nare pointing us to the reality that values must become an\r\nintegral part of statecraft and of diplomacy. Only by\r\ninculcating respect for values will our world straighten up\r\nand fly right.\r\nIn our fledgling world order, my subregion of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) has begun to show\r\nsigns of coming of age. We have established several new\r\nstructures for subregional integration and cooperation.\r\nWe recently joined our friends and neighbours in the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nnon-English-speaking Caribbean and proximate mainland\r\nareas in signing a treaty to establish an ambitious\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States designed to bring about\r\ncoordination, concentration and cooperation in our far-flung\r\nproto-region. Even before this, CARICOM had begun to\r\ndevelop separate cooperative relationships with Central\r\nAmerica, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. In all of these\r\nendeavours, it has become more widely noted that Belize is\r\nideally situated to assist with this bringing together of\r\nvarious subregions. We are equidistant from Tijuana and\r\nParamaribo and, in other respects, are at the very centre of\r\nthis new Caribbean. Belize is bilingual and multi-cultural.\r\nBesides, Belize has a history and a polity which well equip\r\nus for this role.\r\nWe earlier referred to the issue of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. This is an important aspect of the world\r\norder. It is also the quintessential example of the need for\r\nreform and revitalization of this Organization.\r\nThe General Assembly’s health is generally quite\r\ngood. However, in some respects it needs improvement.\r\nOne such area is the roster for this general debate. The\r\nannual seating arrangements for our numerous members are\r\nmade quite democratically and scientifically. Yet the order\r\nof the list of speakers in this debate is not fixed in quite the\r\nsame manner. What is the justification for annually placing\r\ncertain nations at certain positions at the end of the list? I\r\nremember that the Christian Bible makes flattering\r\nreferences to what comes \"Out of the mouths of babes and\r\nsucklings\" (The Bible, Psalms 8:2). Similar expressions\r\ncan be found in every philosophy and religion on this\r\nplanet. It is time that this be learned and observed by those\r\nwho prepare the annual speakers’ list.\r\nWith many others, we call for the development of an\r\nimproved system of coordination here at Headquarters of\r\nthe structure of the Organization’s machinery in the social\r\nand economic sectors. More thought must also be given to\r\nthe rationalization and coordination of the Organization’s\r\nmultifarious development agencies in the field.\r\nEven as the World Trade Organization and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions develop their separate complexes of\r\nstructures and prescriptions, my delegation sees a greater\r\nneed for overall coordination by this premier Organization.\r\nThe United Nations must be appropriately developed as the\r\nfirst among equals within the global organizational system.\r\nWe laud the Secretary-General and the Assembly for\r\nimprovement in the systems of oversight and conditions of\r\nservice, especially in the area of gender equity. But\r\nequitable distribution of staff posts and responsibilities\r\nwithin all United Nations bodies must be radically\r\nimproved.\r\nAbove all, the United Nations must learn to speak\r\nto, not at, the peoples of the world. In the ongoing\r\nefforts to rearticulate, reinform and reinforce the vision of\r\nthe Charter’s framers, we can even envisage our Chief\r\nExecutive going on camera on popular talk shows,\r\nteaching new constituencies about what is after all their\r\norganization. He should continue to find bully pulpits in\r\nthe global electronic information meeting-place, for the\r\nneed to sound the themes that underline the continuing\r\nvitality of our world body is particularly urgent at this\r\ntime. After all, in the run-up to our fiftieth anniversary\r\nwe must be able to give a proper account of our\r\nstewardship, to withstand the special scrutiny we will\r\nsurely now provoke. Our world Government has to\r\ndemonstrate that it is relevant, effective, moral and, above\r\nall, democratic. It is only then that we can fully expect\r\nthat it will be able hereafter to call out ever more clearly,\r\nforcefully and directly to \"We the peoples of the world\".\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nnext on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Home Affairs, Trade and Industry of\r\nSaint Lucia, His Excellency the Honourable William\r\nGeorge Mallet.\r\nMr. Mallet (Saint Lucia): Permit me, Sir, to extend\r\nto you the congratulations of my country and of my\r\ndelegation on your election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. You bring\r\nwith you to the office of the presidency experience which\r\nis both wide and varied. Added to this is your\r\nwell-known commitment to the ideals and principles that\r\ngovern this Organization. These qualities together serve\r\nto provide us with every confidence that under your\r\ndistinguished guidance our deliberations cannot but be\r\nproductive in the furtherance of the objectives of this\r\nworld body.\r\nI want also to take this opportunity to applaud\r\nAmbassador Insanally of Guyana for the distinguished\r\nmanner in which he led the Assembly during its forty-\r\neighth session.\r\nAs the international community gathers once again\r\nto bring its collective wisdom to bear on solutions for\r\ndealing with problems which continue to threaten the\r\nwelfare of the world and its people, we cannot but, with\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\na sense of mixed emotions, reflect on what we as a body\r\nhave been able to accomplish to date. Those emotions\r\nrange from the satisfaction experienced at the success of\r\nour collective efforts to bring about a climate of\r\ncoexistence and harmony in South Africa and the Middle\r\nEast - with the prospects now provided for human\r\nadvancement in those regions - to the sense of deep regret\r\nthat, even as we record such major successes, the suffering\r\nand the waste of human life caused by territorial conflict\r\nand the injustice of decisions based on ethnic considerations\r\ncontinue to place serious obstacles in the path of universal\r\nprogress.\r\nMy delegation salutes both President Mandela and\r\nVice President de Klerk for their courage and determination\r\nin working together to consolidate their strong beginnings\r\nin the direction of a multiracial democracy. My delegation\r\nwill continue to support the international community in its\r\nefforts to assist the millions of deprived South Africans\r\nattain a better quality of life.\r\nHowever, my delegation is still deeply concerned\r\nabout some other countries in Africa, which continue to\r\nwage a hopeless battle against poverty, disease, debt\r\nsettlement and political strife. It is important that more\r\nattention be given to the economic welfare of Africa to\r\nprevent other unfortunate massacres similar to those\r\nwitnessed in Rwanda and Somalia.\r\nIn keeping with the spirit of universality that prevails\r\ntoday, Saint Lucia had hoped that the question of full\r\nmembership of the United Nations for the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan would be favourably considered as a\r\nsupplementary item on the agenda. Saint Lucia continues\r\nto lend its support to the Republic of China on Taiwan in\r\nits efforts to achieve full membership of the United\r\nNations, and urges the inclusion of this item on the agenda\r\nof the fiftieth session. It is indeed anomalous that a\r\ncountry already making a valuable contribution on the\r\ninternational stage should continue to find itself debarred\r\nfrom participation in the family of nations.\r\nSaint Lucia is heartened by the progress towards peace\r\nin the Middle East that has been achieved between Israel\r\nand Palestine and between Israel and Jordan. However, my\r\ndelegation notes with some concern the renewed potential\r\nfor conflict between Iraq and Kuwait, and again calls upon\r\nthe Government of Iraq to recognize and respect the\r\nterritorial integrity of the State of Kuwait.\r\nThe devastating conflict in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nwhich the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nhas lamented has spared no one in its violence, remains,\r\nlike several other conflicts around the world, a major\r\nfocus of peace-keeping and humanitarian efforts by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThese conflicts not only challenge the capacity of\r\nthe United Nations to deal with those problems in a way\r\nthat would lead to their resolution, but also engender new\r\nand frightening dimensions of human suffering, resulting\r\nfrom the large-scale displacement of populations and the\r\nconcomitant disabilities to which they become exposed.\r\nThe net effect of such calamities goes beyond the\r\nurgent call for a global response, in that it creates new\r\nstresses in the developing world, through the diversion of\r\nscarce resources away from peaceful development, into\r\nattenuating human suffering.\r\nMy delegation therefore wholeheartedly supports\r\nefforts by the Secretary-General to foster greater regional\r\ninvolvement in conflict-resolution and in the creation of\r\nappropriate humanitarian support structures.\r\nWith rising unemployment, poverty and drug abuse,\r\nour societies face an almost insurmountable challenge\r\nwhich threatens the ability of our youth to achieve their\r\ntrue potential. The response to this mounting threat\r\nresides in a universal blueprint aimed at reversing the\r\neconomic and social ills from which it springs. In this\r\nregard my delegation supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nAgenda for Development.\r\nThe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, held in Cairo this year, was a powerful\r\ninitiative, however contentious some of the issues may\r\nhave been. The forthcoming World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Copenhagen and the World\r\nConference on Women, to be held in Beijing, offer\r\nprospects of great promise in identifying new approaches\r\nto the attainment of productive employment and the\r\nrelease of innate capacities as well as the empowerment\r\nand participation of all sectors of the population in the\r\nalleviation of their conditions. My country will\r\nparticipate in and support those processes.\r\nSaint Lucia is of the view that the issues leading to\r\nthe isolation of Cuba from the mainstream of economic\r\nand social development within our hemisphere are\r\noverdue for re-examination. My delegation calls for the\r\nspeedy removal of all impediments to Cuba’s ability to\r\nparticipate within the commonwealth of nations in the\r\nmanner permitted by the Charter of the United Nations.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nThe recently concluded agreement between the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America and the\r\nGovernment of Cuba on immigration is timely and\r\nwelcome. My delegation expresses the hope that this\r\nagreement will open new vistas for further dialogue and\r\ngreater understanding between the two countries.\r\nLike other countries of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM), Saint Lucia shares the vision of hope for\r\nHaiti. We are proud to be a participant in the United\r\nNations Mission in Haiti, as we have participated in former\r\nmeans of assistance to Haiti, and, along with our\r\nCARICOM counterparts, assisted by the wider international\r\ncommunity, will work tirelessly for the successful\r\nimplantation of true democracy in Haiti. The unfolding\r\nevents of the past few days give added impetus to the\r\nefforts of the regional and international community to bring\r\nHaiti towards self-fulfilment within the community of\r\ndemocratic nations.\r\nIt has been made clear that the holding of democratic\r\nelections and the installation of a legitimate Government\r\ncannot by themselves guarantee democracy, especially in a\r\ncountry devoid of democratic traditions. To sustain such\r\ndemocratic beginnings, appropriate structures must be put\r\nin place, adequately resourced in both human and material\r\nterms, and suitable support mechanisms must be designed\r\nand firmly rooted. Above all, there must be the\r\ninternational will to encourage, facilitate and enrich this\r\ndemocratic process, as would be exemplified through\r\nmassive development assistance over a sustained period.\r\nThe global economic situation is at present at a critical\r\ncrossroads, reflecting a speedily moving trend towards trade\r\nliberalization and the need for national economies to\r\nimprove their own efficiency and competitiveness.\r\nThe constraints of smallness have continually\r\nconspired against States like Saint Lucia in terms of its\r\nability meaningfully to raise its gross domestic product.\r\nWhile the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)\r\nand its successor organization the World Trade\r\nOrganization, seem to offer medium- and long-term benefits\r\nat least to some developed countries, there remains a\r\nnagging concern among developing countries that certain\r\nbarriers may still remain, or be created, that would\r\neffectively militate against the products of developing\r\ncountries entering the markets of developed countries.\r\nMy delegation joins with the rest of the developing\r\nworld in calling upon the developed world, and the major\r\ninternational institutions, to re-examine their policies and\r\nemphases, with a view to adopting measures that can\r\nrealistically assist small developing economies in their\r\nattempts to keep pace with the dictates of contemporary\r\neconomic trends.\r\nOf particular concern must be the consequences of\r\nthese new developments for small island States such as\r\nours, whose exposed economies make them vulnerable\r\nand sensitive to changes that take place elsewhere. Saint\r\nLucia’s economy, for instance, has already experienced\r\nthe shock resulting from changes brought about by the\r\nadvent of the European Union.\r\nSaint Lucia’s economy is highly dependent on its\r\nexport of bananas to the European Union and despite new\r\narrangements put in place to provide limited access\r\nguarantees for fruit from African, Caribbean and Pacific\r\nStates (ACP) - and Saint Lucia expresses its appreciation\r\nto those European States that have been instrumental in\r\nsecuring these arrangements - the industry in Saint Lucia\r\nhas experienced a devastating downturn in prices, which\r\nin turn has been directly responsible for the economic\r\ndisruption, and its allied social instability, that occurred\r\nduring the latter part of 1993 and this year, 1994.\r\nIt is to be regretted that even the limited concessions\r\nprovided by Europe in discharge of its treaty obligations,\r\nhave been subjected to a withering attack by forces which\r\nseem fully prepared to see the economies of small island\r\nStates, already possessing so little room for flexibility,\r\nplaced in total jeopardy.\r\nThat is the experience that urges this delegation\r\nagain to call the attention of the international community\r\nto the special circumstances of small island developing\r\nStates and the need for particular measures to deal with\r\ntheir peculiar circumstances.\r\nThe Government of Saint Lucia has been observing\r\nwith some concern the development of the North\r\nAmerican Free Trade Association (NAFTA), given the\r\nserious adverse consequences it will have in the medium\r\nterm and long term for relatively nascent industries and\r\nthe micro-economies of our small States. My\r\nGovernment regrets that United States legislation on\r\nNAFTA contains no expressed arrangement which takes\r\ninto account the limits of our industrial base.\r\nConsequently, the fragility of our economies will only\r\nworsen, resulting in economic and social discontent.\r\nIn this regard we appeal to the international\r\ncommunity for special trade considerations while\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nadjustments are made to meet the international challenges\r\nthat the world economic environment engenders.\r\nThe countries of the Caribbean Community, cognizant\r\nof the rapidly changing economic environment, and the\r\nurgent need for cooperative effort to adjust, and in some\r\ncases, survive the challenges ensuing from this change,\r\nhave undertaken measures to deepen their relations with\r\ntheir Caribbean neighbours by formally creating the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States (ACS), membership of\r\nwhich encompasses all countries washed by the Caribbean\r\nSea. We hope the international community will be helpful\r\nin encouraging this self-help initiative to achieve its full\r\npotential.\r\nLast year, at the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, the issue\r\nof sustainable development was accepted as a major\r\ncomponent to be included in the development agendas of\r\ncountries the world over. Arising out of the universal\r\nblueprint emerging from that Conference is the recognition,\r\nat last, of the peculiar circumstances of small island\r\ndeveloping States in their pursuit of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nDesigning development policies and implementing\r\nprogrammes for small island States such as Saint Lucia\r\nrequire considerable imagination and ingenuity, as was\r\nshown by the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held in\r\nBarbados earlier this year.\r\nA successful follow-up to that Conference would rely\r\nheavily on financial resources for the implementation of its\r\nfindings. My delegation calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to provide active support to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, which has been charged with the\r\nresponsibility for the coordination and implementation of\r\nthe programme of action.\r\nOur small island State, Saint Lucia, seems to oscillate\r\nbetween triumph and disaster. Last year we highlighted our\r\ntriumphs in the recognition of our two Nobel laureates.\r\nThis year the disastrous hand of nature in the form of\r\ntropical storm \"Debbie\" struck Saint Lucia, dramatically\r\nemphasizing the vulnerability of small island developing\r\nStates. Over an 11-hour period, this small 660-square-\r\nkilometre territory, historically dependent on agriculture,\r\nmainly bananas, tourism and small-scale manufacturing,\r\nwas battered by nearly 15 inches of rain, resulting in four\r\ndeaths by drowning, numerous landslides, and massive\r\nflooding that destroyed bridges, roads, houses, and 60 per\r\ncent of the banana crop. Even our international airport\r\nlay buried temporarily beneath two feet of water and\r\nmud.\r\nWith over 50 per cent of the working population of\r\nSaint Lucia engaged in banana-associated enterprises, and\r\nwith more than 50 per cent of export earnings derived\r\nfrom banana exports, destruction of 60 per cent of the\r\nbanana crop cannot but create serious economic and\r\nsocial consequences for us. This again underscores the\r\nvulnerability of small States like ours, and the need for\r\nthe international community to recognize their special\r\npeculiarities and needs and to make appropriate provisions\r\nto facilitate their survival.\r\nPermit me, on behalf of my Prime Minister, and the\r\nGovernment and people of Saint Lucia, to express\r\nprofound thanks and appreciation to the several members\r\nand agencies of our Organization for their expressions of\r\nsympathy, concern and support, and, in several cases,\r\noffers or tangible manifestations of assistance in our time\r\nof need.\r\nAs we focus on the milestone of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations and its Charter, we\r\nshould perceive the ideas that subtend this body as a\r\ncementing balm that would bring the disparate pieces of\r\nour shattered globe together in peace, harmony, creativity\r\nand beauty. The United Nations has over the years been\r\nparty to the achievement of many political strides towards\r\ndemocratization and unprecedented levels of cooperation\r\nbetween nation States.\r\nThe global situation that necessitated the creation of\r\nthe United Nations has undergone tremendous changes\r\nover the last 50 years. Our membership has more than\r\ndoubled, and, as we continue to witness the emergence of\r\nnew States, social and economic demands increase,\r\ncoupled with new, pressing concerns, such as the\r\nenvironment, women’s rights, children’s rights and good\r\ngovernance, to name a few. My delegation supports the\r\ndemand for enhancing the resources of the United Nations\r\nto enable it to cope with its expanded responsibilities. It\r\nis also necessary that this Assembly be made more\r\neffective and efficient in the execution of its functions, so\r\nthat it can become more responsive to the needs\r\nparticularly of developing countries, and can assist those\r\ncountries in their development processes.\r\nSaint Lucia joins scores of other delegates in calling\r\nfor an increase in the membership of the Security Council\r\nto reflect the increase in membership of this Organization\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nand the concept of universality that the Charter advocates.\r\nIt is also necessary that the Security Council allow for more\r\nconsultation with the General Assembly in its deliberations\r\nso that its perspectives may become even more reflective of\r\nthe world community.\r\nIn his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 1993, entitled\r\n\"The Antilles, Fragments of an Epic Memory,\" Saint\r\nLucia’s Poet Laureate, Derek Walcott, said:\r\n\"Break a vase and the love that reassembles the\r\nfragments is stronger than that love which took its\r\nsymmetry for granted when it was whole.\"\r\nWe see in this idea the touchstone for the United\r\nNations and the international community as this\r\nOrganization approaches its anniversary year. We can\r\nextend this perception to embrace the cracked vases of our\r\nglobe, in which the horrors of Somalia, the demoralization\r\nand brutality of Haiti, the carnage of the Anglo-Irish\r\nconflict and the racial bigotry in other parts of the world\r\nare all seen as products of the accident of history and the\r\npoverty of the human spirit. It is hoped that through the\r\nefforts of the United Nations a renewed humanitarianism\r\nwill be engendered and bound with a strength that\r\nguarantees peace and the well-being of the world and its\r\npeople.\r\nMr. Pursoo (Grenada): My delegation is pleased to\r\nconvey warmest greetings from the Government and people\r\nof Grenada to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession. We also wish to extend sincere congratulations to\r\nYour Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign Minister of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, on your election to the presidency of this session.\r\nThe Government of Grenada takes this opportunity to\r\ncommend Ambassador Samuel Insanally, the first\r\nrepresentative from the Caribbean ever to hold the high\r\noffice of President of the General Assembly, for his\r\nexemplary conduct of the proceedings of the forty-eighth\r\nsession. We are indeed proud of his performance.\r\nGrenada also wishes to express profound appreciation\r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\nrelentless efforts in the pursuit of the purposes of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nGrenada is pleased to welcome the new South Africa\r\nto the United Nations, and we pay special tribute to His\r\nExcellency President Nelson Mandela for his resolute will\r\nand firm determination in the fight against apartheid, which\r\neventually resulted in this new, democratic and non-racial\r\nSouth Africa.\r\nGrenada is pleased that in recent efforts to bring an\r\nend to the illegal seizure of power by the military in Haiti\r\nand to halt the ensuing human rights abuses there\r\ndiplomacy prevailed and further bloodshed was averted.\r\nWe now eagerly await the reinstatement of the duly\r\nelected Government and its President, Father Jean-\r\nBertrand Aristide, and the return of democracy to Haiti.\r\nWe support the actions taken by the United States of\r\nAmerica and other multinational forces in implementation\r\nof United Nations resolutions on Haiti, and we join\r\nlike-minded nations as they move to establish the\r\nstructures in which development and democracy can be\r\nsustained.\r\nGrenada is prepared to do its part to ensure a more\r\nfertile ground for the growth of democracy in Haiti, our\r\nsister Caribbean country. We are proud that, within the\r\nlimits of our resources, personnel from Grenada’s law\r\nenforcement services are among the multinational\r\ncontingent to help in \"Operation Uphold Democracy\".\r\nAfter all, it was 11 years ago this month that Grenada\r\nitself profited from a similar multinational operation,\r\naffording us the historic opportunity to restore democratic\r\nprinciples to our way of life. It is therefore only natural\r\nthat Grenada should wish Haiti well and should be\r\nprepared to support democracy in that country as fully as\r\nwe do.\r\nOver the last several years many of the small\r\ndeveloping countries within this Organization have been\r\nexperiencing growing economic problems. The forced\r\nresponse has been to take stringent corrective measures\r\naimed at stabilizing their economies and creating the\r\nconditions for sustainable development. Speaking\r\nspecifically of my own country, Grenada, I can inform the\r\nAssembly that in 1992 we embarked on a voluntary three-\r\nyear structural adjustment programme in an effort to\r\ncorrect serious fiscal imbalances and to put the country on\r\na path of sustained growth.\r\nThis year marks the end of the programme, and I am\r\nhappy to report that some success has been achieved.\r\nThe Government has significantly reduced the fiscal\r\ndeficits from 25 per cent of gross domestic product in\r\n1992 to 11 per cent in 1993 and 9 per cent to date.\r\nMoreover, Grenada’s credit rating has improved notably,\r\nwith its creditworthiness restored by the World Bank in\r\nJune of this year after having been forfeited in 1988.\r\nWhatever success has been recorded by that programme\r\nis a credit to regionalism, since the programme was\r\ninstituted with enormous regional inputs. Grenada wishes\r\npublicly to thank the regional Governments and\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\ninstitutions which contributed to the effort. This particular\r\ndevelopment means that Grenada is now viewed more\r\nfavourably by the multilateral and specialized donor\r\nagencies and friendly Governments in terms of external\r\nfinancial assistance for its development programmes.\r\nDespite the good fiscal performance, the structural-\r\nadjustment programme has not been able to achieve its\r\ntargets in terms of the growth rate of the gross domestic\r\nproduct. Thus, over the next two years much emphasis will\r\nbe placed on achieving a reasonable rate of economic\r\ngrowth. In addition, efforts to reduce the fiscal deficits\r\nfurther will continue to be vigorously pursued.\r\nYou, Mr. President, are well aware that a topic of\r\nparticular currency in the area of international economic\r\nrelations is the issue of trade and investment. Of course,\r\nover the past months new trading blocs have been created,\r\nwith the result that in the Western Hemisphere we now\r\nhave several such arrangements, which include the very\r\nimportant North American Free Trade Agreement\r\n(NAFTA). While all the implications of NAFTA are not\r\nyet known, we must nevertheless now seek to position our\r\neconomies to interface with the realities of this new\r\neconomic environment.\r\nIn that context, the conclusion of the latest round of\r\nthe negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\r\nTrade (GATT) has very far-reaching consequences for\r\ntrade. The requirements of trade liberalization and\r\nreciprocity mean that small island developing States like\r\nGrenada must now interact on the same playing field as the\r\nmore developed countries, which, in effect, signals a rapid\r\nerosion of the preferential treatment that some of us have\r\nenjoyed over the past two decades. The removal of access\r\nto market arrangements traditionally favourable to fledgling\r\nindustries in our societies - the banana industry, for\r\nexample - compounds our difficulties and presents a major\r\nthreat to the overall well-being of our small economies.\r\nFurthermore, the creation of the World Trade Organization\r\nwould most definitely change the face of international trade,\r\nand while every independent nation has the opportunity to\r\nbecome a party to that Organization and thus attempt to\r\ninfluence its operations, it is evident that, on that score,\r\nequality will not necessarily ensure equity. We are\r\ncognizant of the fact that we must now seek to enhance our\r\nproductivity and competitiveness in carefully selected areas\r\nif we are to survive in this era of trade liberalization. But,\r\nmore often than not, we cannot do it alone, and this is why\r\nmy delegation appeals to the developed countries to be\r\nconsiderate of our fragile economies and the need to adapt\r\nto this seemingly hostile economic environment.\r\nThe recent success of the United Nations Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States, held in Barbados, and the\r\nadoption of its Programme of Action underscore the\r\nurgent need for international co-operation and assistance,\r\nnot only in the form of financial resources for the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action, but also in\r\naccess to markets, acquisition of new technologies and\r\ninstitutional and human-resource development, so as to\r\nenable us to respond more capably to the challenges of\r\nfinding new paths to sustainable development.\r\nThe advances made since the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development must be\r\nbuilt upon, and in this regard the importance of forging\r\nnew global partnerships between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries ought to be given priority. The\r\nprotection of the global climate and biological diversity,\r\nthe sustainable use and conservation of all marine\r\nresources and the protection of our oceans and high seas\r\nrequire urgent international assistance and cooperation.\r\nMy delegation therefore looks forward to the\r\nfulfilment of the obligations of the developed countries\r\nthat have pledged their commitment to assist developing\r\ncountries and, in particular, small island developing\r\nStates, in the implementation of the decisions and\r\nrecommendations of Agenda 21, the conventions on\r\nclimate change and biodiversity and all the follow-up\r\nconferences of the Rio Conference.\r\nFor several years Grenada has expressed its concern\r\nat the apparent unbalanced resource commitment to\r\nsecurity issues versus development. Consequently, my\r\ndelegation commends recently expanded efforts aimed at\r\ngiving greater prominence to the development needs\r\nconfronting the world, particularly in the developing\r\ncountries. We applaud the Secretary-General’s report \"An\r\nAgenda for Development\" and we applaud the former\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr.\r\nSamuel Insanally, for his visionary initiative in organizing\r\nthe World Hearings on Development in June of this year.\r\nWe urge that the momentum gained therefrom be\r\nmaintained, and we wish to place on record our support\r\nfor Brazil’s call for a global conference on development\r\nin the year 1996.\r\nThe question of population and development is a\r\nvery sensitive issue, one that demands continuous\r\nconscientious global effort. Grenada is encouraged by the\r\nconsensus which emerged from the recently concluded\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nat Cairo, and we are hopeful that increasingly balanced\r\ndevelopment will be viewed as the essential basis on which\r\nto treat the issue of population.\r\nWe are also confident that the Conference on Women\r\nto be held at Beijing in 1995 will address one of the long-\r\nstanding issues critical to development, that is, the issue of\r\nwomen in development.\r\nIn March of 1995 world leaders will gather in\r\nCopenhagen to address one of the most pressing questions\r\nof our time, the question of social development. We will\r\nbe asked to rule on the debilitating issues of poverty,\r\nmeaningful employment and social inclusion. We will be\r\nasked to rule particularly in the interest of youth, the aged,\r\nthe disabled and all those outside the mainstream of social\r\nintegration.\r\nGrenada is confident that the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and all the other follow-ups to the Rio\r\nConference are replacing despair with hope worldwide. At\r\nthe same time, we are concerned about the different spins\r\nthat may be put on the interpretation of those agreements.\r\nFor example, we are concerned that environmental causes\r\nshould not be used as barriers to access for goods produced\r\nin developing countries to the markets of those with more\r\nprosperous economies. We hope that, on the contrary, the\r\ndeveloped countries will appreciate the need to assist the\r\npoorer countries to gain access to the technologies and\r\ntechnological know-how necessary to the promotion of\r\nmore-balanced development on a global scale.\r\nStability within and between States is a prerequisite\r\nfor international peace and security. Grenada is encouraged\r\nby certain developments, beginning almost a year ago with\r\nthe signing of the historic peace treaty between Israel and\r\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization. We believe that the\r\nemergence of self-rule in Jericho and Gaza is of great\r\nsignificance. We look forward to further positive\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process and wish all\r\nthe countries in that region the peace and stability upon\r\nwhich lasting prosperity will be built.\r\nGrenada is encouraged by the diplomatic efforts in the\r\nsearch for a permanent solution to the crisis in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. We commend the United Nations for its\r\nresolve and determination in this regard. We fully support\r\nthe establishment of the International Tribunal to try\r\nallegations of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. By the\r\nsame token, Grenada fully supports similar initiatives in\r\nresponse to situations in other parts of the world, where\r\nthese are deemed appropriate.\r\nIn the light of the unfortunate circumstances in\r\nRwanda that resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands\r\nof lives, and bearing in mind other situations of human\r\ndevastation, Grenada wishes to express its satisfaction\r\nwith the responses from those members of the\r\ninternational community that have gone to the aid of\r\npeople in various sorry situations. We also wish to\r\nconvey our appreciation to the relief agencies and others\r\nwhose tireless efforts have saved lives, restored health to\r\nthe sick and hungry and brought comfort to countless\r\nvictims - particularly women and children.\r\nMy delegation wishes to underscore the importance\r\nof human rights, freedom and good governance as vital\r\npreconditions to domestic quietude, international harmony\r\nand the creation of the climate necessary for the\r\nachievement of progress within societies. In this regard,\r\nthe promotion and protection of the rights of children is\r\nan issue that cries out for greater attention. The\r\nwell-being of children cannot wait for the unprompted\r\nevolution of societies. Deliberate efforts must be\r\nexpedited at various levels, global and national, to ensure\r\nthe promotion and protection of children’s rights.\r\nLikewise, in this the International Year of the Family and\r\nbeyond, emphasis should continue to be placed on the\r\npivotal role of the family in national and global\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe end of the cold-war era presents opportunities\r\nfor a shift from political and ideological divide to\r\ncooperation in the areas of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. New economic Powers on the world scene\r\nseek to occupy positions that were once the prerogative of\r\nthe traditional super-Powers. Grenada believes that the\r\nstructure of the organs of the United Nations should\r\nreflect these new developments and, at the same time,\r\nmake provision for geographical representation that is\r\nconsistent with today’s global, political and economic\r\nrealities. Reforms currently being undertaken in the\r\nUnited Nations system provide an opportunity to examine\r\nthe question of expanding the Security Council and the\r\nquestion of the veto power in the light of these new\r\nrealities.\r\nGrenada supports the principle of universality and\r\nencourages the General Assembly to give renewed\r\nconsideration to the wish of the Republic of China - a\r\nfounding Member of the United Nations - to participate\r\nin the Organization and its specialized agencies as a full\r\nMember. We believe that this appeal from the 21 million\r\npeople of the Republic of China in Taiwan for a voice\r\nand proper representation in the international community\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nis both moral and legitimate. The inclusion of the Republic\r\nof China in Taiwan in the United Nations would further\r\ncontribute to global cooperation in trade, economic\r\ndevelopment and environmental and ecological protection.\r\nIn addition, it would assist in the promotion of international\r\ndevelopment assistance to developing countries. Grenada\r\nbelieves that a committee should be set up to examine the\r\nexceptional nature of the situation of the Republic of China\r\nin the present international context.\r\nSo long as drug traffickers and international arms\r\ndealers continue to ply their trade, and so long as\r\nmercenaries, terrorists and other adventurists exist, the\r\nprotection and security of small States will remain\r\nparticularly vulnerable to acts of aggression, from without\r\nas well as from within.\r\nWhile the United Nations Charter recognizes the right\r\nof States to take measures in self-defence, the reality is that\r\noften small States faced with serious threats lack the means\r\nto do so. Small States invariably look to the provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Charter to secure respect for and\r\npreservation of their sovereignty. It is therefore necessary\r\nthat the protection and security of small States remain a\r\nvery pertinent issue among the concerns of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe tasks of the organs and bodies of the United\r\nNations are by no means easy. Old tensions have given\r\nway to new tensions and concerns, which demand\r\nimaginative approaches if solutions are to be found. As we\r\nembark upon preparations for the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations in 1995, let us train our sights on the\r\nfactors that brought the United Nations into being in the\r\nfirst instance and on what gives the Organization its special\r\nworthiness.\r\nThe challenge is to attain and maintain long-term\r\nglobal peace and stability and to enhance the prospects for\r\nsolving global problems of an economic, social, cultural or\r\nhumanitarian nature. To this end, we as a community of\r\nnations must rededicate ourselves to working ever\r\nrelentlessly and concertedly towards the goal of making our\r\nplanet a safer, better and happier place in which to live.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of\r\nBurundi, His Excellency, Mr. Jean-Marie Ngendahayo.\r\nMr. Ngendahayo (Burundi) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): It is an honour and a privilege for me to address\r\nthe Members of this Organization. In doing so, I convey\r\nthe greetings of the President of the Republic of Burundi,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, and of the\r\nGovernment and people of Burundi, as well as their good\r\nwishes for every success at this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI should like also to greet and congratulate His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, on his unanimous election to preside\r\nover the General Assembly’s work at this session.\r\nYour statesmanlike qualities, developed in the course\r\nof a long and rich career as a diplomat, augur well for\r\ngreat success at this forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Through your impressive election, the General\r\nAssembly has once again paid tribute to Africa and to\r\nyour country, so committed to peace and international\r\ncooperation. I assure you that my delegation will give\r\nyou every support as you strive to fulfil your mandate.\r\nMy congratulations also go to the other members of\r\nthe Bureau, who, I feel sure, will spare no effort in their\r\npractical support for you in the successful\r\naccomplishment of your heavy responsibilities.\r\nI should also like warmly to congratulate your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Samuel Insanally of the Republic of\r\nGuyana, who, as President at the forty-eighth session,\r\nguided the work of the Assembly masterfully and with\r\nexemplary commitment.\r\nLastly, we pay a warm tribute to Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nfor all the activities he has initiated in order to cope with\r\nthe many challenges and enormous difficulties facing our\r\nOrganization today. We believe that these obstacles are\r\nnot insurmountable provided that there is honest\r\ncommitment and solidarity on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. Thanks to the resolve and perseverance of\r\nthis Organization, which mobilized the Member States\r\nagainst apartheid, peace and democracy have now\r\ntriumphed in South Africa. The people and the\r\nGovernment of Burundi have already welcomed this well-\r\ndeserved victory of the valiant South African people, who\r\nhave thus resumed their place in the concert of nations.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is\r\nbeing held at a time of many serious and unexpected\r\nevents. There have been natural disasters throughout the\r\nworld: famine, civil war, terrorism and other scourges of\r\nmodern times, such as religious fundamentalism and the\r\nre-emergence of exclusionary movements, associations or\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\npolitical parties, all bearing within them the seeds of\r\ndivision.\r\nA year ago, from this very rostrum, the late President\r\nMelchior Ndadaye conveyed to this Assembly a message of\r\npeace, friendship, brotherhood and solidarity. This occurred\r\njust after the pluralist elections of June 1993, which the\r\nentire world had found to be free and transparent. Then, on\r\n21 October 1993, President Ndadaye was assassinated in a\r\nrash and senseless act that plunged Burundi into desolation,\r\ndivision and political and ethnic massacres, and sorely\r\ntested the hard-won democracy. Since that fateful day,\r\nBurundi has suffered a serious political, institutional, social\r\nand economic crisis, the repercussions of which are still\r\nbeing felt today. We all recall the unbearable images\r\nbroadcast by the international media.\r\nLet us further recall that the successor to President\r\nNdadaye, Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira, died tragically in an\r\nairplane accident in Kigali on 6 April 1994, which also\r\ntook the life of the Rwandese Head of State. Misfortunes\r\nnever come singly; Burundi had the terrible shock of losing\r\ntwo Presidents in less than six months. This situation has\r\nprofoundly traumatized the people of Burundi. Some\r\nwondered if Burundi would be able to avoid the human\r\ncataclysm recently experienced by its neighbour Rwanda.\r\nIndeed, the institutional crisis that resulted from the vacuum\r\nof power, and the various manifestations of violence that\r\nfollowed, crystallized latent antagonisms, exacerbated latent\r\nethnic divisions and created an atmosphere of suspicion and\r\nintolerance that was prejudicial to peace.\r\nDespite the dark picture I have just painted, the people\r\nof Burundi has not succumbed to despair. Indeed, the\r\nregistered political parties and the representatives of civil\r\nsociety have met in a negotiating forum and begun in-depth\r\ndiscussions with a view to finding ways and means of\r\nensuring a swift return to peace, security, trust and socio-\r\neconomic and political stability in the country.\r\nThe lengthy discussions which began after the death\r\nof President Cyprien Ntaryamira last April recently led to\r\nthe signing on 10 September 1994 of a government\r\nconvention. This document is a basis for the\r\nreestablishment of State institutions and organs of State and\r\nof various legal and political mechanisms which will restore\r\ntrust and cooperation between the political partners. The\r\nsuccessful outcome of these lengthy negotiations has\r\nallowed the people of Burundi to heave a sigh of relief.\r\nThe people had begun to tire and above all to question the\r\ngood faith of politicians who, as far as the people could\r\nsee, were more concerned with their own selfish interests\r\nthan in peace and the development for one and all.\r\nWe take this opportunity to thank the international\r\ncommunity for the role it has played in encouraging the\r\npeople of Burundi to pursue national dialogue and\r\ncooperation. We are particularly grateful to the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity for the\r\ndecisive role they played in ensuring the successful\r\noutcome of the negotiations. The Special Representatives\r\nof the Secretaries-General of these organizations,\r\nAmbassadors Ahmedou Ould Abdallah and Léandre\r\nBassole respectively, participated at every stage of the\r\nnegotiations we have just concluded. We welcome the\r\nprogress made together through this preventive diplomacy.\r\nWe believe that the choice of a consensus President,\r\nMr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the consensus nomination\r\nof a Prime Minister from the opposition, and the\r\nformation of a coalition Government are all factors\r\nconducive to restoring security and confidence among the\r\nvarious elements of Burundi society and to promoting the\r\nreturn of displaced persons and refugees to their homes in\r\nthe hills. They are also very important in encouraging\r\nreconstruction and the economic recovery of the country.\r\nThe new national coalition government that arose\r\nfrom the consensus reached in the negotiations between\r\nthe political partners has, as its main tasks, the\r\nreconstruction of the economic and social infrastructures\r\nthat were partly or totally demolished, the campaign\r\nagainst a general sense of impunity, and the establishment\r\nof conditions guaranteeing the safety and peace of all in\r\nBurundi. The tasks ahead are enormous and cannot be\r\ncarried out without the solidarity and assistance of the\r\ninternational community on a bilateral and/or multilateral\r\nbasis.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to recall the request\r\nmade by the Government of Burundi for the organization\r\nof a neutral international inquiry to establish responsibility\r\nfor the October 1993 putsch and the ensuing massacres.\r\nThe international community has always stood by us in\r\ntimes of anguish and we feel sure that it will continue to\r\nsupport our efforts by providing emergency special\r\nassistance for economic recovery and reconstruction.\r\nWe also reiterate our appeal to the United Nations\r\nand friendly countries to continue to support the\r\nproponents of peace and progress in Burundi and to\r\ndiscourage and condemn all those at home and abroad\r\nwho may be tempted to use violence to resolve the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nproblems we are experiencing. Today silence means\r\ncomplicity and is criminal.\r\nLasting solutions to Burundi’s political problems can\r\nbe found only if they are dealt with in a subregional\r\ncontext. For some years now we have been witnessing\r\nforced movements of populations following violence\r\nperpetrated in some countries of our subregion. These\r\nmovements, often out of control, are a threat to peace and\r\nstability throughout the Great Lakes region.\r\nNo one can fail to see that the tragedy of Rwanda has\r\nshocked human conscience at the subregional, regional and\r\ninternational levels. It is shameful not only for those\r\nbehind genocide, or those who have committed it, but also\r\nfor mankind as a whole, which has not been able to rush to\r\nthe aid of a people in peril. My country hopes that those\r\nguilty of this crime against humanity will be brought to\r\njustice and receive the punishment they deserve. We\r\nencourage the Government of Rwanda to continue its policy\r\nof reconciliation and to do its utmost to ensure that all\r\nRwandese refugees can return to their homeland.\r\nThe crisis in Rwanda has had most regrettable\r\nconsequences for neighbouring States - above all for\r\nBurundi, which has ethnic, linguistic and cultural\r\nsimilarities to Rwanda. The Rwandese tragedy has had\r\npolitical, security, economic, humanitarian and\r\nenvironmental consequences. We need not go into details,\r\nbecause the whole world saw on television the human tide\r\nflee fighting to take refuge in neighbouring countries, such\r\nas Burundi, Tanzania and Zaire. The refugee problem has\r\nbeen acute in our subregion since the 1960s. As the\r\nAssembly knows, it is both a humanitarian and a political\r\nproblem. It causes discord between neighbouring States\r\nand has engendered mistrust between them. Some see\r\nrefugees as an economic and social burden, while others\r\nconsider them a threat to their security.\r\nFor these reasons, we propose that an international\r\nconference on peace, stability and development in the\r\nAfrican Great Lakes subregion be organized as soon as\r\npossible. In the short term, it is a matter of resolving the\r\nrefugee problem. In the medium term, inter-State\r\nmechanisms should be established to safeguard peace,\r\nbolster stability and promote socio-economic development.\r\nSuch a conference could pave the way for the creation of\r\na more viable economic community combining existing\r\norganizations, such as the Economic Community of the\r\nGreat Lakes Countries and the Kagera River Basin\r\nOrganization and adapting them better to the realities of our\r\nsubregion. We believe such a conference would help\r\nintegrate our States, which share an almost identical\r\nhistory, the same geographical space and, above all, an\r\nability to communicate through common languages. My\r\ndelegation is willing to make specific proposals on this\r\nmatter.\r\nNext year the United Nations will celebrate half a\r\ncentury of existence. In 50 years the Organization has\r\naccomplished a great many tasks. It has overcome many\r\nobstacles, survived the cold war and contributed to the\r\nadvent of international détente. Its specialized agencies\r\nhave assisted millions of people in distress. The\r\nOrganization has always committed itself to actions to\r\nmaintain international peace and security. It has been\r\nable to foster friendly relations between nations based on\r\nrespect for the principle of equal rights of peoples and\r\ntheir right to self-determination. The United Nations has\r\ncontributed to dialogue between the peoples and States of\r\nthe world by encouraging relations of cooperation and\r\nsolidarity.\r\nNone the less, the Organization, like any human\r\nenterprise, is far from perfect. Despite efforts to settle\r\narmed conflicts, we must note that the brinksmanship and\r\nintransigence of certain belligerents diminish hopes for\r\npeace.\r\nIn Africa, the conflicts in Somalia, Angola and\r\nLiberia seem to go on for ever, notwithstanding the\r\nefforts of the United Nations to resolve them.\r\nWith regard to the crisis in Somalia, we know it was\r\nthe massive intervention of the Blue Helmets that led the\r\nparties involved to the negotiating table. The operation\r\ninspired some hope that the people of Somalia would\r\nachieve reconciliation. Unfortunately, the conflict\r\ncontinues. Burundi believes the United Nations should\r\ncontinue this operation, using all the means authorized by\r\nthe Charter. At the same time, we call on the parties\r\ninvolved to settle their differences peacefully and to lend\r\nevery possible assistance to any mediation effort.\r\nAs to Angola, the political and military situation has\r\ncontinued to deteriorate, with an escalation of the fighting\r\nand greater mistrust between the belligerents. While\r\nwelcoming the resumption of the negotiating process\r\nbetween the Government of Angola and UNITA, my\r\nState wishes to repeat its appeal for a cessation of the\r\nhostilities that have brought so much suffering to the\r\npeople of Angola.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nIn Liberia, peace has not yet been restored. There has\r\nbeen delay in full implementation of the Cotonou\r\nAgreement - signed on 25 July 1993 by the Interim\r\nGovernment of National Unity, the National Patriotic Front\r\nof Liberia (NPFL) and the United Liberation Movement of\r\nLiberia for Democracy (ULIMO), under the auspices of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS),\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of African Unity -\r\naimed at finding a peaceful settlement to the conflict. The\r\nRepublic of Burundi pays tribute to the efforts made by\r\nECOWAS and the United Nations to bring about a peaceful\r\nsettlement of that conflict, which continues to bring such\r\ngrief to the people of Liberia.\r\nWe also support the United Nations peace plan for\r\nWestern Sahara, which involves a referendum to allow the\r\nSaharan people to choose their own destiny.\r\nAfrica is today the scene of the largest number of\r\narmed conflicts in the world. This political instability\r\nmeans we cannot tackle development in our countries,\r\ndespite the vast natural resources of our continent. We\r\nbelieve it is high time Africans stopped blaming their\r\nmisfortunes on outside factors. We firmly believe that\r\nAfrica must shoulder its responsibilities and define the\r\nmain lines of its development in accordance with its\r\nrealities. We must respect our identity while accepting any\r\npositive contribution from outside. Burundi has no doubt\r\nthe time will come when Africa will show its capacity for\r\nself-improvement and that it will be able to contribute more\r\nto the well-being of mankind. In other words, through the\r\ndemocratic reforms now under way, our continent, which is\r\ncurrently undergoing a period of upheaval, will attain the\r\nfreedom and development it so desires.\r\nMy country welcomes the new era opening up in the\r\nMiddle East. The peoples of that region are finally going\r\nto be able to work together for peace, security and\r\ndevelopment. We pay tribute to all the countries and\r\ninstitutions that contributed to the mediation efforts and\r\nencourage them to continue their diplomatic efforts with a\r\nview to a final and irreversible settlement of that conflict,\r\nwhich has lasted far too long.\r\nThe situation in the Balkans is also a matter of\r\nconcern. Work must continue to reconcile the positions of\r\nthe various parties. War does not resolve problems of\r\ncoexistence and good-neighborliness between peoples.\r\nOn the Korean peninsula, we wish for the voluntary\r\nand peaceful reunification of Korea. We also encourage\r\ncontinued negotiations between the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States of America, in\r\nthe hope that they will remove all uncertainties with\r\nregard to the nuclear problem.\r\nAs the Secretary-General pointed out so aptly in \"An\r\nAgenda for Development\", there can be no peace without\r\ndevelopment. And the 1994 World Human Development\r\nReport also states:\r\n\"The absence of peace can indeed hinder\r\ndevelopment; but without development, peace is\r\nthreatened.\"\r\nDevelopment requires international cooperation and\r\nassistance from other States. The Charter sets as one of\r\nthe purposes of the United Nations:\r\n\"to achieve international cooperation in solving\r\ninternational problems of an economic, social,\r\ncultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting\r\nand encouraging respect for human rights and for\r\nfundamental freedoms for all without distinction as\r\nto race, sex, language, or religion\".\r\nProblems arising from the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity and those of a humanitarian character,\r\nparticularly after the cold war, have led the Organization\r\nto extend its operations to the four corners of the Earth.\r\nSome observers even fear that development activities will\r\nbe neglected so long as urgent and immediate needs\r\nmonopolize the Organization. Some go so far as to say\r\nthat the discussion on development should be shifted from\r\nthe General Assembly to other, better equipped\r\ninstitutions.\r\nIn Burundi, we consider that development, and the\r\nrelated problems and needs, must also be one of the\r\npriorities of the United Nations. There can be no better\r\nplace than the General Assembly to deal with problems as\r\nglobal and interconnected as poverty, debt, the\r\nenvironment, development assistance and other equally\r\nthorny world-wide issues.\r\nOn the matter of combating poverty and other social\r\nproblems, Burundi places great hope in the upcoming\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, where it intends\r\nto be represented at the appropriate level. Our delegation\r\nwill spare no effort to ensure that the declaration to be\r\nadopted at the Copenhagen Summit will correctly reflect\r\nthe concerns of poor peoples.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nThe external debt problem of the developing countries\r\nis also a crisis, and it must be dealt with more innovatively\r\nthan it has been in the past. Many strategies have been\r\nadopted to resolve the problem. Specific actions have been\r\ntaken by creditors to restructure commercial debt and in\r\nsome cases to cancel bilateral debt. But as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has pointed out, to date, the efforts made to lighten\r\nthe burden of multilateral debt have been far from\r\nsatisfactory.\r\nThe subject of multilateral debt should thus also be\r\ncarefully studied. My country hopes that the discussion to\r\nbe held on the agenda item on debt will result in\r\nconclusions that can lighten the burden of multilateral debt,\r\nparticularly with regard to the fragile economies of the least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nThe current situation regarding trade relations is\r\nextremely disturbing. The industrialized countries are\r\nerecting major barriers to the importation of certain\r\nproducts from developing countries. At the same time,\r\nhowever, the latter countries, under the effect of\r\nliberalization policies, are opening wide their doors to\r\nforeign competition.\r\nAccording to the most reliable sources, the damage\r\ndone to developing countries exceeds the amount of aid\r\nallotted to them; however, should the rich countries\r\neliminate all obstacles to the importation of products from\r\nthe third world, the increase in exports from developing\r\ncountries would equal twice the aid granted to these\r\ncountries.\r\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the creation\r\nof the World Trade Organization augur well for a more\r\norderly and equitable system of world trade. We maintain\r\nthe hope that accompanying measures will be taken to\r\navoid the marginalization of developing countries in the\r\nmultilateral trade system. We are thinking, in particular, of\r\nthe least developed countries which run the risk of being\r\npoor relations within the new World Trade Organization.\r\nFor some years, the international community has been\r\naware of the non-sustainable nature of the development and\r\nconsumption patterns followed thus far, without concern for\r\nthe protection of the environment.\r\nAs the Secretary-General emphasizes in \"An Agenda\r\nfor Development\", the environment, like peace, the\r\neconomy, society and democracy, permeates all aspects of\r\ndevelopment. In the last few years, the General Assembly\r\nhas seriously taken up the issues of environment and\r\ndevelopment. The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, in\r\nJune 1992, gave birth to international legal instruments\r\nwhich, if implemented, will ensure a better environment\r\nand more harmonious development for the Earth and its\r\ninhabitants. My country, Burundi, has already signed\r\nthese instruments, and it will soon ratify them.\r\nBurundi has been closely following the discussion\r\nthat has been under way for some time at the United\r\nNations with a view to reforming and improving the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council. The ideas put\r\nforward are quite diverse. We earnestly hope that this\r\ndiscussion will lead to a solution that will preserve the\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council while allowing the\r\ndeveloping countries to have their voices heard within\r\nthat body.\r\nIf the democratic reforms desired by our peoples are\r\nto be lasting and irreversible, there must be support from\r\nthe international community, for democracy against a\r\nbackdrop of social crisis, unemployment, or poverty,\r\ncould prove illusory. My country places great hope in the\r\nUnited Nations, which alone can contribute to solving\r\nmankind’s current problems, such as those of population,\r\nthe environment, economic and social development and\r\nhealth, particularly at a time when certain countries of the\r\nworld are shaken by endemic illnesses. We cannot pass\r\nover in silence the scourge of our time - AIDS. The\r\ninternational community must pool its efforts to suppress\r\nthis scourge.\r\nWe express the hope that the United Nations will\r\ncontinue to pursue the ideals and purposes contained in its\r\nCharter. May international relations become more\r\ndemocratic, and a new, more just and equitable, political\r\nand economic order emerge.\r\nWe also hope that, as this century draws to a close,\r\nour Organization will be able to achieve tangible results,\r\nparticularly in removing the spectres of hunger, poverty\r\nand war.\r\nWe all aspire to peace, justice and freedom. In our\r\nendeavours, we must succeed in achieving them, in order\r\nto give future generations the opportunity to live in a\r\nbetter world.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Sudan, who wishes to speak\r\nin exercise of the right of reply. May I remind\r\nrepresentatives that, in accordance with General Assembly\r\ndecision 34/401, statements in exercise of the right of\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and\r\n5 minutes for the second, and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Yassin (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic): The\r\nfact that some delegations have voiced concern over the\r\ncontinuing conflict in the south of Sudan and the suffering\r\nof our citizens makes it necessary for us to reply.\r\nIt is the Sudan, the principal party which bears the\r\nbrunt of the continuing war and conflict, that is more\r\nconcerned over the situation, because the attrition caused by\r\nthis war depletes the material resources we are very much\r\nin need of for our progress and development. This is a war\r\nthat could not have lasted so long were it not for the direct\r\nsupport the rebels have continued to receive from outside\r\nPowers which do not want Sudan to focus on its progress,\r\ndevelopment and the consolidation of its unity. This\r\nproblem which was engineered and buried in our soil by\r\ncolonialism has been a time bomb and a thorn in the side\r\nof Sudan since before its independence.\r\nI should add that the present Government, since it\r\ncame into power in June 1989, has accorded the highest\r\npriority to this problem. As early as September 1989, it\r\norganized a national peace conference on the issues of\r\npeace. The conference made it clear that this was a\r\npolitical problem that arose from discrepancies between the\r\nlevels of development in different parts of the country.\r\nNot content with this, the Government negotiated with\r\nthe rebels in Addis Ababa in August 1989, and in Nairobi\r\nin November 1989. It then held two rounds of talks in\r\nAbuja. The Government did not even wait for the end of\r\nthe negotiations to lay the groundwork for a solution. It\r\nintroduced a federalist system wherein the country was\r\ndivided into 26 states, 10 of which are in the south. The\r\nGovernment established \"peace villages\" and initiated\r\ndevelopment projects in the southern states wherein it set\r\nup local governments. This led to the return of large\r\nnumbers of people to those states in the context of the\r\ninternal peace efforts. Those returnees worked for the local\r\ndevelopment projects in education, agriculture, and other\r\nfields.\r\nIn pursuing the negotiating process which it regarded\r\nas the best means for the achievement of a peaceful and\r\njust settlement to the problem, the Government requested\r\nthe Intergovernmental Authority for Drought and\r\nDevelopment (IGADD) to ensure continued participation by\r\nparties in the negotiations. As an earnest indication of the\r\nGovernment’s desire for peace, it suggested the setting up\r\nof a more practical mechanism that would ensure\r\ncontinued negotiation in the context of shuttle diplomacy.\r\nThis was motivated by the desire to speed up\r\nnegotiations, as a certain slowness was noticed in\r\nIGADD’s mediation. We are fully convinced that the\r\nrebels are not negotiating in real earnest. They have\r\nresorted to procrastination, evasion and procedural tactics\r\nwith the aim of stalling negotiations. Their human rights\r\nviolations, the kidnapping and conscription of children\r\nand killing of relief workers are proof positive that they\r\nbear the primary responsibility for the lack of progress in\r\nthe negotiations.\r\nThe statement by the Foreign Minister of sisterly\r\nZambia, who spoke of his country’s concern over the\r\ngeneral deterioration of human rights in Sudan, is strange\r\nindeed. The Ambassador of Sudan, when he presented\r\nhis credentials to the President of Zambia last week,\r\nheard from the President positive remarks concerning\r\nSudan and expressions of keen interest in relations\r\nbetween Sudan and Zambia.\r\nIt should be noted that Sudan was the first country\r\nthe President of Zambia visited, following his election to\r\nthe presidency. It is regrettable that the Foreign\r\nMinister’s statement echoed the baseless propaganda\r\ncampaign waged against my Government. Sudan has\r\nkept its doors open to all those who wished to inform\r\nthemselves as to the situation of human rights in Sudan.\r\nAll those who visited Sudan found out for themselves that\r\nthe reason for this campaign was political vindictiveness,\r\nand that it rests on nothing but selectivity and bias.\r\nAs for the document that has been distributed with\r\nthe statement of the Chairman of the European Union\r\n(EU), it supported the Special Rapporteur whose report\r\ncontained columny against the religion of Islam which has\r\nmore than one billion followers the world over.\r\nMoreover, this Rapporteur has made himself a self-\r\nappointed party to the internal politics of Sudan by\r\nparticipating in all the activities of the opposition in\r\nSudan. This deprives him of impartiality required in an\r\ninternational civil servant who acts on behalf of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nSudan reaffirms that the refusal to delete the\r\nparagraphs attacking Islam will prevent Sudan from\r\ncooperating with this Rapporteur.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, who wishes to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Thank you, Mr. President,\r\nfor giving me this opportunity to speak to the Assembly\r\nabout the financial situation of the Organization.\r\nMany Member States have addressed this issue during\r\nthe general debate - often in candid terms.\r\nIt has been pointed out that there is no use talking\r\nabout reshaping the responsibilities of the United Nations\r\nunless the resources are there to carry out those\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nIt has been said that the capacity of the United Nations\r\nto respond to the demands made on it for peace-keeping\r\ndepends on the willingness of Member States to contribute\r\nthe resources needed to fulfil such a role.\r\nAnd even more directly, it has been pointed out that\r\nthe United Nations works wonders with what Member\r\nStates do not pay it, but it simply cannot keep running on\r\nexhausted credit.\r\nAt the end of August 1994, the Organization had debts\r\nexceeding $1.7 billion. This amount includes about $1\r\nbillion owed to some 70 Member States for their troop and\r\nequipment contributions to peace-keeping missions. At the\r\nsame time, the United Nations owes $400 million to\r\nvendors and suppliers. It owes $325 million for budgetary\r\nsurpluses in prior years, amounts which should have been\r\nreturned to the Member States.\r\nIn addition, the Organization requires some $400\r\nmillion each month to meet the costs of regular budget and\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nAgainst these overwhelming financial demands, on 31\r\nAugust of this year the United Nations had $375 million in\r\ncash balances. At the same time, Member States owed\r\nsome $3.2 billion for contributions assessed but not paid -\r\nI repeat: $3.2 billion.\r\nIn my letter of 21 July of this year to the former\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, I drew attention to the\r\ngrave situation we face in cash accounts of peace-keeping\r\noperations. I outlined a number of emergency measures.\r\nWhile a number of Member States responded positively, the\r\nproblems continue. Therefore, I once again draw the\r\nattention of the General Assembly to this serious situation.\r\nTogether, we must restore a viable financial basis in order\r\nto enable the Organization to continue its work in the\r\nservice of the Member States.\r\nThe causes of our precarious financial situation are\r\nclear.\r\nThe first cause is late payments by Member States\r\nof assessed contributions, for both the regular budget and\r\nfor peace-keeping operations. While some Member States\r\npay their assessments on time, many others do not. By\r\nthe end of August, only 56 Member States had paid their\r\nregular budget assessment in full, while 70 Member\r\nStates had made no payment towards their 1994 regular\r\nbudget assessment. By the end of September, 62 Member\r\nStates still had made no payment.\r\nThe second cause lies in the process of approving\r\npeace-keeping budgets and appropriations. Months go by\r\nbetween the date when the Security Council approves a\r\npeace-keeping mission and the date when cash to pay for\r\nit is first received. Following Security Council approval,\r\ndetailed budgets for the missions have to be prepared and\r\napproved before the required amounts can be assessed.\r\nObviously, more time passes before the assessed\r\ncontributions are actually paid.\r\nIn other words, lateness and delay create an\r\nimbalance in the cash position of the Organization. The\r\ninflow of cash is far less than the Organization needs to\r\nmeet its obligations. Because of these late and delayed\r\npayments, the Organization has had to delay, in turn, its\r\nown payments to Member States. In effect, the Member\r\nStates which wait for payment from the United Nations\r\nare financing the late payment by other Member States.\r\nThis is not a satisfactory state of affairs.\r\nI am pleased to confirm that in recent weeks a\r\nnumber of Member States have made substantial\r\npayments. This has ameliorated the situation. Some\r\npayments to troop- and equipment-contributing Member\r\nStates have been made possible. But amelioration is not\r\na solution. Cash inflow from Member States has been\r\nfollowed by cash outflow to reimburse Member States.\r\nThus, the situation was eased temporarily but not\r\nresolved. The Organization’s liabilities still far exceed its\r\navailable cash, and therefore the financial situation\r\ncontinues to be precarious.\r\nThe problem is not only the Member States’ late or\r\ndelayed payments; there is a more fundamental problem.\r\nThe Organization has extremely limited cash reserves.\r\nThe Working Capital Fund, less than one month’s\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nrequirement of the regular budget, is today virtually\r\ndepleted. And at present, there is practically no cash in the\r\npeace-keeping reserve fund.\r\nThe Organization simply cannot operate effectively\r\nunder these constraints. We must have a secure capital\r\nbase with attendant cash reserves. Therefore I ask\r\nMembers to consider not only the problems caused by late\r\nand delayed payments but also the fundamental problem of\r\ninsufficient reserves. I ask that Members urgently consider\r\nthese issues.\r\nThere is another important element in the\r\nOrganization’s financial structure: the method of\r\nassessment. Over the years, Member States have endorsed\r\nthree basic concepts regarding the Organization’s expenses.\r\nOne concept is \"capacity to pay\". Member States with\r\ngreater per capita resources and ability to pay should bear\r\na greater share of the costs. A second concept - for\r\npeace-keeping expenses - is that the permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council bear a special responsibility and that\r\nthose with greater resources should bear a greater share of\r\nthe cost. And the third concept is that realignment of\r\nMember States’ contributions should be based on objective\r\nmeasures.\r\nMember States may wish to review the practical\r\napplication of these concepts in the sharing of the\r\nOrganization’s expenses. Each Member State should\r\nseriously consider whether the present scale of assessments\r\nis equitable. Some have expressed strong doubts. From\r\nthis review, adjustments to the existing arrangements could\r\nemerge. It is important that Member States view the\r\narrangements for sharing the Organization’s expenses as\r\nfair.\r\nIn my report on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/49/1), I stressed the urgent need to overcome the critical\r\nfinancial situation of the United Nations. The problem has\r\nassumed a proportion which undermines the effectiveness\r\nof the Organization as a whole. The ability of the United\r\nNations to perform the functions for which it was created\r\nis in danger.\r\nThis is no longer simply a financial question; it is an\r\nurgent political question.\r\nThe ideas which I have described are outlined in\r\ngreater detail in a document being distributed to delegations\r\nas I speak. I offer them as a contribution to the solution of\r\nthis vital issue. These questions require consideration at the\r\nhighest political level. It is important that the General\r\nAssembly address them directly and effectively this year.\r\nI stand ready, Mr. President, to provide any\r\nadditional information or assistance you may require on\r\nthis important subject. I have asked the\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Administration and\r\nManagement to be at your disposal for that purpose. I\r\nhave every confidence that, under your guidance, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will respond.\r\nI thank the Assembly for providing me with this\r\nopportunity to speak. I am sure that together we can\r\nsummon the vision and the will to solve these urgent\r\nproblems. At this point in the history of the United\r\nNations, when its potential is greater than ever before, we\r\ncan do no less than give it the means to realize that\r\npotential.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for the important statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nBefore bowing to the custom whereby the President\r\nof the General Assembly summarizes the statements made\r\nduring the general debate, I want most sincerely to thank\r\nall the speakers who congratulated me and wished me\r\nwell in carrying out the tasks entrusted to me by the\r\nAssembly; I deeply appreciated those kind words. I\r\nassure members that I am fully available to work closely\r\nwith all delegations towards success in the work of this\r\nsession.\r\nWithout fear of error we can already say that the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly will be an\r\nexceptional one, given the large number of participants\r\nand the high level of the delegations. We have had the\r\nhonour and privilege of hearing statements by one\r\nmonarch, 31 presidents, 14 heads of Government, two\r\ncrown princes, 120 ministers and 11 heads of delegation;\r\nthey eloquently expressed their countries’ perceptions of\r\nthe world situation today.\r\nHaving studied the statements made in the general\r\ndebate, I wish to make the following comments.\r\nFirst, I note that the international community in\r\ngeneral feels frustrated by unkept promises about building\r\na post-cold-war world of global peace and security.\r\nAdmittedly, there has been some tangible progress\r\nin the area of democratization and human rights. But the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nincreased number of regional and civil conflicts taking\r\nplace against a backdrop of ethnic and religious\r\nantagonism, and the uncertainty and hesitancy that mark the\r\npace of nuclear disarmament, give us the impression that\r\nthe world situation today has become more complex\r\nbecause the threats are more diffuse.\r\nIn connection with that concern, I welcome the\r\nunanimous recognition in the general debate of the virtues\r\nof preventive diplomacy and of the need for the financial\r\nand military means to carry out effective peace-keeping\r\noperations. The universal interest of speakers in this matter\r\nconfirms the validity of the Secretary-General’s \"Agenda\r\nfor Peace\" - if such confirmation were necessary.\r\nSecondly, I note with satisfaction that economic and\r\nsocial development held a central place in the majority of\r\nstatements. In that connection, the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposed Agenda for Development was rightly seen as an\r\nindispensable complement to \"An Agenda for Peace\", for\r\npolitical instability and civil strife often have their roots in\r\npoverty and socio-economic inequality. There was\r\nparticular emphasis on the need quickly to devise practical\r\nmachinery for the implementation of the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment through action-oriented programmes. There\r\nwas also emphasis on the need to relaunch what were great\r\nchapters in United Nations history - the North-South\r\ndialogue and the major United Nations Conferences on\r\nTrade and Development - so that the struggle for\r\ndevelopment can be returned to the heart of United Nations\r\nactivities.\r\nFurthermore, it was reassuring to note that the\r\ninternational community continues to accord the same\r\npriority to Africa, as there is still sustained interest in the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s. In that connection, the working group on a\r\ndiversification fund should be reactivated so that it can\r\ncontinue work towards the speedy establishment of such a\r\nfund, the importance of which is universally recognized.\r\nThirdly, I want to highlight the very timely remarks\r\nmade by many speakers about reform of the United Nations\r\nsystem. Above all, I noted that interest was focused on the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council through expansion of\r\nits permanent and non-permanent membership. Though\r\nsuch a development would seem inevitable, the diversity\r\nand complexity of the solutions put forward make a\r\ndecision on this question difficult for the time being. In\r\nany event, the Assembly’s debate on this item in coming\r\ndays should clarify the details of the various perceptions of\r\nthis matter.\r\nIt would be useful, therefore, for the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council to resume its work as soon as possible\r\nand to undertake the necessary consultations; I propose to\r\nreappoint the two Vice-Chairmen of that Group. I have\r\nno doubt that these efforts will yield results acceptable to\r\nall.\r\nIn this connection, I can only welcome the\r\nforthcoming summit meeting of the Security Council for\r\nit is clear that among other important decisions that will\r\nbe taken by that supreme body, useful information will be\r\nmade available which will provide more input into the\r\nwork of the Working Group on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nTurning to my last, but not least, comment, I would\r\nrecall the interest taken throughout the general debate in\r\nthe financial situation of the United Nations. Moreover,\r\nwe have just heard the important statement by the\r\nSecretary-General describing all aspects of this issue.\r\nThe focus of concern is as follows. Faced with the\r\nincrease in what the United Nations has to do, particularly\r\nin peace-keeping operations and humanitarian assistance,\r\nthe available financial resources today are inadequate.\r\nThe financial situation of the United Nations today\r\nis extremely serious. The difficulties relate, to some\r\nextent, to delays in the payment by Member States of\r\ntheir contributions. But it is clear that the question has to\r\nbe taken up in all its aspects including, inter alia, the\r\nquestion of the scale of assessments. I think this is a\r\nvery important point and one that should be studied with\r\nthe tranquillity and lucidity that the situation requires. I\r\nfeel sure that delegations will take up this matter and, as\r\nsoon as possible, hold appropriate consultations with a\r\nview to finding the right answer to this important\r\nquestion.\r\nStill on the financial aspect of affairs, on the\r\nquestion of financing operational activities for\r\ndevelopment - consideration of which was deferred from\r\nthe forty-eighth to the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly - within the context of the restructuring and\r\nrevitalization of the United Nations in the economic,\r\nsocial and cultural areas, I am considering asking the\r\nChairman of the Working Group to continue his\r\nconsultations and I firmly believe that those efforts will\r\nbe successful.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 12 October 1994\r\nIn conclusion, I would just like to restate what has\r\nbeen said so eloquently here during this very enlightening\r\ngeneral debate, namely that, on the eve of its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, the United Nations must adapt to the\r\ndevelopments in the world today.\r\nThis is a task incumbent primarily on us, the\r\nMember States, and so we must buckle down to the work\r\nwithout any further delay so that our universal\r\nOrganization may be able to take up the new challenges\r\nof the twenty-first century; and so that we may be able to\r\npursue even more effectively our mission as a unique and\r\nirreplaceable instrument in the service of, and for the\r\npromotion of, international peace, development and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 9?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n23\r\n"
