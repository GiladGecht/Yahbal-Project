(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 13\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice (A/49/4)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): This\r\nmorning the Assembly will first turn to the report (A/49/4)\r\nof the International Court of Justice covering the period\r\n1 August 1993 to 31 July 1994.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of\r\nthe report of the International Court of Justice?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nupon Mr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Bedjaoui (Algeria) (President of the International\r\nCourt of Justice) (interpretation from French): It is a\r\npleasure and honour for me to address the Assembly under\r\nthe presidency of His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, and I\r\nshould like to extend warm congratulations to my friend on\r\nhis noteworthy election, which delights me for many\r\nreasons — first, for the United Nations itself and then for\r\nAfrica, and lastly, for him personally. His small village in\r\nthe north-eastern corner of Côte d’Ivoire must surely feel\r\ngreat pride, but so too does another village, the global\r\nvillage that our world has become and whose members are\r\nassembled here — in other words, the representatives of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn keeping with a welcome tradition that is now\r\nfirmly established, the General Assembly has seen fit to\r\ndevote some of its valuable time to hearing the President\r\nof the International Court of Justice on the occasion of its\r\nexamination of the Court’s annual report. I am\r\nparticularly honoured to be addressing you for the first\r\ntime in this capacity.\r\nI find this privileged contact between the General\r\nAssembly and the Court extremely significant on at least\r\ntwo scores. In the first place, the Court, with its\r\nheadquarters far from New York, needs to maintain links\r\nof consistent and close collaboration with the other\r\nprincipal organs, links that will guarantee the successful\r\naccomplishment of its and their tasks and, in addition,\r\nensure the concerted attainment of the aims of the\r\nOrganization. In the second place, the Assembly, as the\r\nonly organ in which all the Member States of the\r\nOrganization are represented, is for that reason a unique\r\nforum of expression of the international community that\r\nthe Court is specifically required to serve.\r\nAs the report for 1993-1994 shows, the past year has\r\nseen a confirmation of the tendency towards a renewed\r\ninterest in the Court’s jurisdiction that has been evident\r\nfor some time now. The Court currently has\r\n10 contentious cases on its list. A new case was brought\r\nin May of this year and concerns the land and maritime\r\nboundary between Cameroon and Nigeria. This is an\r\nimportant matter for the parties, and its submission to the\r\nCourt bears new witness to the faith of the African\r\ncontinent in international justice. There is one request for\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nan advisory opinion on the Court’s General List at the\r\nmoment; it deals with a request made in September 1993\r\nby the World Health Organization concerning the legality\r\nof the use by a State of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.\r\nThat request, which, as may be imagined, raises some\r\nserious issues, has prompted much concern in the\r\ninternational community, judging by the unusual number of\r\nStates — 40 or so — that have submitted written\r\nstatements to us. In addition, the Court’s jurisdiction has\r\nbeen further extended. Two new declarations, one from\r\nGreece and the other from Cameroon, have been deposited\r\nwith the Secretary-General, and a new multilateral treaty\r\nproviding for the Court’s jurisdiction has been notified to\r\nthe Court while, at the same time, various reservations to\r\ncompromissory clauses in certain multilateral treaties have\r\nbeen withdrawn.\r\nThese signs, encouraging as they are, must not be\r\nallowed to give us a false impression. The real or potential\r\nvolume of the Court’s activities — expressed in quantitative\r\nterms: the number of cases pending, declarations subscribed\r\nor compromiser clauses in international agreements — does\r\nnot provide a sufficient answer to the fundamental question,\r\nwhich is not whether or not the Court is extremely busy but\r\nwhether it is fully occupying its rightful place in the system\r\nfor the maintenance of peace, as instituted by the Charter.\r\nA quick comparison with the Court’s predecessor —\r\nthe Permanent Court of International Justice — would,\r\nmoreover, prove somewhat disappointing if confined to the\r\nquantitative aspects I have mentioned. In some respects it\r\nseems that the Permanent Court was more consistently\r\nborne in mind by the States of the time. It may, for\r\ninstance, be noted that, of the 48 States parties to the\r\nStatute of the Court in January 1939, 36 had made a\r\ndeclaration of acceptance of the Court’s compulsory\r\njurisdiction. Despite the progress that has been made in\r\nrecent years, the proportion is much lower in the case of\r\nthe present Court as, to date, there are only 58 declarations\r\nin force — many of them subject to substantial\r\nreservations — although there are 186 States parties to the\r\nStatute of the Court.\r\nBeyond specific possible explanations of these\r\nphenomena, it must be admitted that they look singularly\r\nparadoxical in view of the role that each of these Courts\r\nwas required to play in its distinctive juridical and\r\ninstitutional context. The Permanent Court, which, as will\r\nbe recalled, was not even an organ of the League of\r\nNations, belonged to a system which, in the context of the\r\ntime, aimed essentially to do no more than establish peace\r\nin order to preserve the status quo. The framers of the\r\nCharter, on the other hand, had radically different\r\nambitions, their efforts being directed towards the\r\nestablishment of an entirely new international society —\r\na society consistently moving towards progress; a society\r\nmore just, more egalitarian, more wont to show solidarity,\r\nmore universal; a society all of whose members were to\r\nengage in an active and collective endeavour to usher in\r\na full and lasting peace.\r\nIt was therefore to be expected that the International\r\nCourt of Justice — which at San Francisco was expressly\r\nintended to be an institution completely distinct from its\r\npredecessor, to be fully integrated into the new\r\nOrganization and to share its original concerns and\r\npurposes — would from the outset be associated far more\r\nclosely and meaningfully with world issues than the\r\nPermanent Court had been.\r\nUnfortunately, this has not been the case. The fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, to be celebrated next\r\nyear, and that of the Court the following year will no\r\ndoubt provide suitable occasions for stocktaking and for\r\ncomprehensive and detailed reflection on this paradox.\r\nNone the less, I should like on this occasion to offer\r\nthe Assembly and, through it, to each of the States of\r\nwhich it is made up an outline of my thinking on this\r\nmatter and, thereby, to associate myself with the efforts\r\nthat have already been made in various other settings —\r\nthe United Nations Decade of International Law; the\r\ndeliberations of the Special Committee on the Charter;\r\n“An Agenda for Peace” — with a view to reinforcing the\r\nrole of the Court.\r\nArticle 7 of the Charter gives the Court the status of\r\na principal organ of the United Nations, and Article 92\r\nmakes it the principal judicial organ. As such, the Court\r\nis clearly an essential part, not just of the machinery set\r\nup by the Charter for the peaceful settlement of disputes,\r\nbut also of the general system for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security that it introduced.\r\nNo provision of the Charter or of the Statute of the\r\nCourt sets any limits to the Court’s action in this respect.\r\nIn particular, no provision along the lines of Article 12 of\r\nthe Charter would, on the face of it, preclude a finding by\r\nthe Court on a dispute being dealt with by the Security\r\nCouncil or by any other organ or agency.\r\nRelations between principal organs are, generally\r\nspeaking, governed by the principles of speciality,\r\nequality, the power of each to determine its own\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\njurisdiction, and coordination. The whole architecture of the\r\nUnited Nations is based on the rule of autonomy for each\r\nprincipal organ, none of which is subordinate to any other,\r\nand on the requirement of the concerted pursuit of the\r\ncommon objectives set forth in the Charter. In the absence\r\nof any other specific restriction, the Court has always\r\nconsidered the referral of a dispute to more than one\r\nprincipal organ as not in itself constituting any impediment\r\nto its performance of its duty.\r\nThe Court is the judicial organ of an international\r\ncommunity still based upon what has been called a\r\njuxtaposition of sovereignties. It suffices, in principle, for\r\ntwo requirements to be met if the Court is to decide a\r\ncontentious case. On one hand, the parties must have\r\ngranted the Court jurisdiction to deal with the case; on the\r\nother hand, the dispute referred to the Court must be of a\r\nlegal nature. Moreover, Article 36 of the Charter recognizes\r\nthat, as a general rule, legal disputes should be submitted to\r\nthe Court.\r\nIt is precisely this concept of a legal dispute, as\r\ntraditionally opposed to that of a political dispute, that\r\nseems to have been misinterpreted and to have been one of\r\nthe reasons for the underutilization of the Court in\r\ncontentious cases. It seems that — under the influence, no\r\ndoubt, of considerations inherited from the period prior to\r\nthe adoption of the Charter — there has long prevailed\r\namong States the feeling that the Court should be seized\r\nonly of standard disputes deemed to be exclusively legal\r\nand, ultimately, perceived as relatively marginal or minor.\r\nI solemnly appeal to States to review their criteria for\r\nthe seizing of the Court and at no time to disregard the fact\r\nthat a referral to the Court of no more than a subsidiary\r\nlegal aspect of a much broader political dispute might well\r\ncalm the situation at once and change the whole face of the\r\ndispute.\r\nIn reality, when the Court has been seized of legal\r\nissues arising in the wider setting of an eminently political\r\ndispute it has never, for that reason, refused to deal with\r\nthe case — not even in the event of the use of armed force.\r\nOn the contrary, its jurisprudence clearly points to the\r\ndecisive contribution that it has made on various occasions\r\nto the maintenance or restoration of peace between the\r\nparties.\r\nI need only call to mind the Order for the indication\r\nof provisional measures that was made on 10 January 1986\r\nby the Chamber of the Court responsible for dealing with\r\nthe Frontier Dispute between Burkina Faso and Mali. That\r\nOrder, which was read out in a public sitting on the very\r\nday after the Chamber had heard the Parties, at a time\r\nwhen serious incidents had just broken out between their\r\nrespective armed forces, can serve as an example in many\r\nrespects. I shall merely note that the Order, which\r\nenjoined both Parties strictly to observe the cease-fire,\r\nwas acted upon while negotiations were still under way in\r\nother, essentially regional settings.\r\nTo take a more recent example, I would also refer at\r\nthis juncture to the Judgment delivered by the Court on 3\r\nFebruary 1994 in the case concerning the Territorial\r\nDispute between Libya and Chad. That Judgment put an\r\nend to a conflict which, for over 20 years and despite\r\nmany unavailing attempts to achieve a political settlement,\r\nhad seriously threatened peace in the region. I wish to\r\npay a special tribute to the Libyan Government and to the\r\nGovernment of Chad, which spared no effort to\r\nimplement the Court’s Judgment without delay and in a\r\nspirit of friendly understanding. As early as 4 April 1994,\r\nthe Parties signed an Agreement concerning the practical\r\nmodalities for the implementation of the Judgment; on 30\r\nMay 1994, they signed a Joint Declaration stating that,\r\nunder the Agreement, the withdrawal of the Libyan\r\nadministration and forces from the Aouzou Strip had been\r\neffected as of that date.\r\nThese two examples amply demonstrate that the\r\nCourt is perfectly able, for all the modest material\r\nresources at its command, swiftly and effectively to fulfil\r\nthe function entrusted to it by the Charter as an essential\r\ncomponent of the system for the maintenance of peace for\r\nwhich the Charter provides. It suffices, for that purpose,\r\nthat States refer their disputes to it, thus enabling it to\r\nplay its rightful role to the full. There is no case with a\r\nlegal dimension which lies a priori outside the Court’s\r\nsphere of competence.\r\nThe Court’s credibility as a principal organ and as a\r\npre-eminent means of achieving the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes is thus largely in the hands of States. I am\r\ndeeply convinced that only when the members of the\r\ninternational community have discarded their longstanding\r\nprejudices and are, I would venture to say,\r\npsychologically ready to have recourse to the Court as\r\nnaturally as to the political organs, without seeing such\r\naction as necessarily any more serious, conflictual or\r\nunfriendly, will the Court be able fully to perform its\r\nfunction. Some States may perhaps tend to have\r\nmisgivings about such judicial settlement on the grounds\r\nthat, unlike a political settlement, it would be completely\r\noutside their control and hence, given the reputed rigidity\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nof legal rules, always liable in the end to turn out less\r\nfavourably to themselves.\r\nI think I can safely say here that such fears are largely\r\ngroundless. The Court, by the nature of the law it applies,\r\nby the role it fulfils and by its composition, is better able\r\nthan any other judicial institution to withstand blind\r\napplications of the law. While being sufficiently precise to\r\noffer those who come before it all the legal security to\r\nwhich they legitimately aspire, international law remains at\r\nthe same time and in essence a flexible and open law. The\r\nCourt itself, incidentally, has on several occasions explained\r\nthat the fact of its deciding in law by no means rules out —\r\nquite the contrary — due regard for equity infra legem or,\r\nin other words, “that form of equity which constitutes a\r\nmethod of interpretation of the law in force, and is one of\r\nits attributes”. Moreover, as we know, there are specific\r\nareas of international law, such as the law of the sea, where\r\nreference is constantly made to equitable principles. As a\r\nbody integrated into the system for the maintenance of\r\npeace that was established under the Charter, the Court\r\nnever loses sight of that ultimate objective.\r\nThus, the important step recently taken by the Court\r\ntowards the Parties in the case concerning Maritime\r\nDelimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and\r\nBahrain provides indisputable evidence of the dynamic and\r\nresponsible judicial policy applied by the Court and\r\nprompted by its constant concern to hear and determine\r\ncases in the interest of peace. Furthermore, the composition\r\nof the Court as a “World Court” which must, in accordance\r\nwith Article 9 of its Statute, give an equitable\r\nrepresentation to the main forms of civilization and the\r\nprincipal legal systems of the world, taken together with its\r\nworking methods and, in particular, the collegiate nature of\r\nthe Court, provide firm guarantees of its perfect\r\nunderstanding of the concerns of all States. The Court is\r\nmade up of equal, independent and impartial judges; there\r\nis no right of veto and no political patronage at the Court.\r\nThe Court takes its decisions on the basis of law, following\r\na most minute and meticulous examination of each case,\r\nwithout failing to take account of the meta-juridical factors,\r\nthe expectations of the Parties and the imperative\r\nrequirements of justice and peace. Indeed, many a smaller\r\nor weaker State has obtained through the Court what it\r\nwould no doubt never have been able to secure by other\r\nmeans.\r\nThere can be no doubt, of course, that each method of\r\npeaceful settlement has its distinctive virtues, not only from\r\nan intrinsic point of view but also in the light of each\r\nparticular situation. Accordingly, while the Charter makes\r\nit obligatory for States to settle their differences by\r\npeaceful means, it refrains from laying down a specific\r\nmode of settlement. That being so, it could clearly be no\r\npart of my intention to advocate the substitution of\r\njudicial settlement for any other course of action, but only\r\nto remove certain ambiguities surrounding it.\r\nThe considerations I have just advanced with\r\nessential reference to the contentious procedure before the\r\nCourt apply, mutatis mutandis, to the advisory procedure,\r\nthe importance of which has long been underestimated.\r\nOnly of late has there been a real awareness of the\r\npotential impact that the Advisory Opinions of the Court\r\ncan, either directly or indirectly, have upon the\r\nmaintenance of peace. A relevant legal question put in a\r\ntimely manner to the Court may, by the answer it elicits\r\nor indeed of itself, to prove to be an effective tool of\r\npreventive diplomacy or contribute, even substantially, to\r\nthe settlement of a dispute that has already arisen. Many\r\nan Advisory Opinion has in the past had diplomatic and\r\npolitical implications that were by no means\r\ninconsiderable. Thus, while we are all profoundly\r\ngratified to have among us in this Assembly the\r\nrepresentatives of the young State of Namibia, I am\r\nparticularly happy and proud to be able to affirm that,\r\nthrough its Advisory Opinions in the South West Africa\r\ncases, the Court made its contribution to the eagerly\r\nawaited accession of that State to independence.\r\nThere are also many advisory opinions that have had\r\na decisive influence on the progress made in international\r\nlaw since the end of the Second World War. By way of\r\nexample, one has only to recall the advisory opinion —\r\nrevolutionary in the legal context of the time — that the\r\nCourt handed down in 1949 on the objective international\r\npersonality of the United Nations and its capacity to ask\r\nfor reparations.\r\nHowever, little advantage is taken of the system of\r\nadvisory opinions today, perhaps even less than is taken\r\nof the Court’s contentious jurisdiction, if one considers\r\nthe benefits the system consistently makes available to\r\ninternational organizations, the flexibility of its\r\nimplementation and its essentially non-binding character.\r\nI am pleased to observe in passing that the General\r\nAssembly has been by far the body most inclined to refer\r\nits queries to the Court. Chances are good that a keener\r\nperception by the international community, both of the\r\nnature of the mission entrusted to the Court and of the\r\npotential of its advisory procedure, will soon give fresh\r\nimpetus to recourse to the advisory function, which is so\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nfundamental for an international community aspiring to be\r\ngoverned by the primacy of law.\r\nAs I see it, the essential thing for the Court’s\r\nimmediate future is therefore an affirmation, in seats of\r\ngovernment, of the political will to take a fresh and more\r\nrealistic look at the Court. That, it seems to me, is the very\r\nmodest price that has to be paid if the Court is to resume\r\nthe place in world affairs that the framers of the Charter\r\noriginally intended it to occupy.\r\nI do not think I need to dwell on the few criticisms\r\ncustomarily levelled at the Court, which may have made\r\nsome Governments more reluctant to approach it, as their\r\ngroundlessness is nowadays widely acknowledged. One\r\nsuch criticism is the purported slowness of the Court’s\r\nproceedings. It is true it takes an average of two years for\r\nthe Court to settle a case. There are limits, however, to\r\nwhat the Court can do when sovereign States submitting\r\nimportant matters to it seek, quite understandably, to give\r\nthe best chance to their arguments by asking permission to\r\nsubmit several written pleadings or to be given sufficient\r\ntime to present their cases, first in writing and later orally.\r\nIn fact, once the Court begins its deliberations, things\r\ngenerally move very fast: it is usually only a few months,\r\nor even weeks, between the end of oral proceedings and the\r\nrendering of the Court’s Judgment.\r\nThe Assembly will certainly recall the speed with\r\nwhich the Court responded to the Assembly’s request for an\r\nadvisory opinion concerning the applicability of the\r\nobligation to arbitrate under section 21 of the United\r\nNations Headquarters Agreement of 26 June 1947. The\r\npublic hearings on that case ended on 12 April 1988, and\r\nthe Court’s advisory opinion, a rather long and complex\r\none, was rendered just 14 days later, on 26 April. As a\r\nprerequisite of the sound administration of justice,\r\nexpeditiousness is therefore dependent essentially on the\r\nwill, not of the Court, but of those resorting to it.\r\nThe second criticism to which I was referring concerns\r\nthe financial cost of the Court’s proceedings. For the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations that contribute to its\r\nbudget, access to the Court is free of charge. The\r\ncornerstone of any judicial proceedings is the cardinal\r\nprinciple of equality of the parties, and this principle\r\nunderlies all the procedural provisions of the Court’s\r\nStatute and Rules.\r\nNone the less, we all understand that this formal\r\nequality, crucial though it is, does not suffice to allay the\r\nmisgivings of the least-privileged States. True justice\r\nrequires that all be equal before the judge, not just de jure\r\nbut also de facto. For this reason I must pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General for his noteworthy initiative resulting\r\nin the establishment of a special trust fund in 1989\r\ndesigned to help those States that cannot afford the\r\nexpense of referring a dispute to the International Court\r\nof Justice for settlement.\r\nMay the generous contributors to the fund be\r\nwarmly thanked in the name of international justice.\r\nTheir exemplary gesture bears heartening witness to a\r\ngrowing solidarity within the international community. I\r\ninvite all those able to do so to join them, in the same\r\nspirit, in order to increase the fund’s resources. I also\r\ninvite all those in need of assistance from the fund to take\r\nfull advantage of its resources. Such a system of judicial\r\ncooperative action would, if confirmed and extended, be\r\nan unquestionable sign of great maturity on the part of the\r\ncommunity of States.\r\nIn recent years international relations have been\r\nmarked by upheavals as numerous and significant as they\r\nhave been unexpected. If the United Nations wishes to\r\ncontinue the successful pursuit of its noble and difficult\r\nmission, it is essential that it show itself to be capable of\r\nadapting swiftly and effectively to new circumstances.\r\nVarious ideas have already been advanced in this respect.\r\nNeedless to say, they will have to include the functions of\r\nthe Court.\r\nStates, traditionally qualified as “primary” or\r\n“necessary” subjects of the international legal order,\r\nwhich are today the only entities with access to the\r\nCourt’s contentious jurisdiction, are no longer the only\r\nactors in international relations or the only interlocutors\r\non matters of peace-keeping, as they were in the 1920s.\r\nInternational affairs show us every day that greater\r\nallowance also has to be made at this level for other\r\nentities. By the same token, access to the Court’s advisory\r\njurisdiction may henceforth appear unduly restricted if\r\none imagines the enormous potential of the advisory\r\nfunction and of the existing demand for it. One might\r\nenvisage the possibility, not only that other entities of the\r\nOrganization, in particular the Secretary-General, might\r\nbe able to request advisory opinions of the Court, but also\r\nthat that option might be extended when appropriate to\r\nthird organizations that are not part of the United Nations\r\nsystem but that make an important contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of peace at, for example, the regional level.\r\nThese are all questions of great importance for the\r\nfuture of the Court and for world peace. They need to be\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nexamined very closely in the near future, and I hope to be\r\nable to speak to the General Assembly about them again\r\nsome day.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I thank\r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (interpretation from French):\r\nIt is a great privilege for me to speak here on the occasion\r\nof our consideration of the annual report of the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, the International Court\r\nof Justice, whose lofty responsibility it is to settle, in\r\naccordance with international law, disputes brought to it in\r\naccordance with international law, and whose jurisprudence\r\nis a major source of the development of international law.\r\nBefore making specific comments on the report, I wish\r\nto discharge the pleasant duty of paying a well-deserved\r\ntribute to the President of the International Court of Justice,\r\nMr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, and praise his great professional,\r\nmoral and human qualities. For national and personal\r\nreasons, I welcome the presence in the Assembly of\r\nPresident Bedjaoui, and I wish to express warm\r\ncongratulations to him, on behalf of the Algerian delegation\r\nand on my own behalf, on his brilliant election to the\r\npresidency of the International Court of Justice. Our warm\r\ncongratulations also go to the Vice-President,\r\nMr. Stephen Schwebel, who, thanks to his great integrity\r\nand outstanding legal competence, will together with\r\nPresident Bedjaoui doubtless constitute a driving force in\r\nstrengthening the moral authority of the United Nations and\r\nthe rule of law in international relations.\r\nFinally, I cannot fail to welcome the participation in\r\nthe Court of the three new judges elected during the\r\nprevious session of the General Assembly by the Assembly\r\nand the Security Council: Mr. Abdul Koroma, Mr. Carl-\r\nAugust Fleischhauer and Mr. Shi Jiuyong respectively.\r\nIn his characteristically clear and eloquent statement,\r\nMr. Bedjaoui just informed us of the increasing activities of\r\nthe Court. My delegation is pleased at the confirmation of\r\nthis tendency, which was already noticeable these past few\r\nyears, since respect for international law, one of the prime\r\ncomponents of which is growing recourse to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, must be a priority for the\r\ninternational community and the States that comprise it.\r\nThus it is only natural that States should be making\r\nincreasingly frequent use of the Court in contentious\r\nmatters. This is a tangible indication of States’ growing\r\nconfidence in the Court and of their desire to settle disputes\r\nby peaceful means, by having more systematic recourse to\r\nthe procedures provided for in the United Nations Charter\r\nand in other international instruments. In that respect, it\r\nwould be highly desirable to see the provisions of\r\nArticle 36, paragraph 3, of the Charter systematically\r\napplied; these provisions, I would recall, provide that:\r\n“In making recommendations under this Article\r\nthe Security Council should also take into\r\nconsideration that legal disputes should as a general\r\nrule be referred by the parties to the International\r\nCourt of Justice ...”.\r\nThe relevance of such an approach is illustrated most\r\ngraphically in the Court’s report of the Judgment in the\r\ncase Territorial Dispute between the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya and Chad, two fraternal African countries. In\r\nthat Judgment, the Court not only definitively settle a\r\ntwenty-year-old dispute to the satisfaction of both parties,\r\nwhich formally committed themselves to carry out, and\r\ndid so, the Court ruling but also provided a new and\r\nparticularly edifying example of the principle of the\r\nintegrity of borders inherited by African countries at the\r\ntime of their accession to independence, a principle\r\nwhich, as everyone knows, the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) solemnly adopted and proclaimed in its first\r\nSummit of OAU Heads of State in July 1964. I would\r\nlike to say how pleased Algeria is at the positive outcome\r\nof this Chadian-Libyan territorial dispute over the Aouzou\r\nStrip and how happy we are at the outstanding role\r\nplayed by the Court in this case.\r\nRegarding consultative matters, we cannot but note\r\nthat, as President Bedjaoui stated, the possibilities offered\r\nby the Court remain undeniably underutilized. This is all\r\nthe more regrettable, since the legal framework exists as\r\nmuch for certain primary organs of the United Nations as\r\nfor certain other international organizations, which are\r\nentitled to request advisory opinions of the Court on legal\r\nquestions. In the period covered by the Court’s report,\r\nonly the World Health Organization deemed it useful to\r\nrequest an advisory opinion on the question of whether\r\nthe use of nuclear weapons by a State is in keeping with\r\ninternational law.\r\nDespite the Court’s growing activities, there is no\r\nquestion that it is not sufficiently utilized, notably in\r\nconsultative matters, and particularly by the other\r\ncompetent principal bodies of the United Nations, namely\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council.\r\nThe profound changes that have occurred in recent\r\nyears on the international scene have resulted in a broad\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\ndebate on the role and place of the United Nations.\r\nFortunately, this discussion has not taken refuge behind\r\ntheoretical or academic speculation; rather, it has given rise\r\nto a vast movement — although relatively limited for the\r\ntime being — to revitalize and restructure the\r\nOrganization’s organs in the economic, social and related\r\nfields, as well as the work of the General Assembly, and to\r\nreview the composition and functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil. It would only be natural and appropriate for the\r\nInternational Court of Justice to in turn be connected with\r\nand involved in this growing but irreversible trend, a trend\r\nthat flows logically within the new international\r\nconfiguration resulting from the end of the cold war.\r\nThe necessary revitalization of the activities of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice should naturally flow from\r\nthe historical logic of adapting to new international realities,\r\nand be translated into a new appreciation of the role and the\r\nplace of the Court as an integral part of the United Nations.\r\nAlong these lines, I should emphasize that the\r\nmovement — already longstanding but which has taken a\r\nmore promising turn since last year — towards expanding\r\nthe composition of the Security Council, something which\r\nwe are all aware will require some time as well as a\r\nrevision of the Charter, should in no way overlook the\r\npotential and resources of the International Court of Justice.\r\nIndeed, the potentially substantial input of the Court should\r\nbe neither neglected nor underestimated. The same goes for\r\nrequests for advisory opinions which the organs entitled to\r\ndo so might more frequently seek. The same also goes for\r\nthe monitoring of constitutionality, which the Court might\r\nengage in with respect to the actions of the other principal\r\norgans of the United Nations, within a framework of\r\nnecessary respect for their respective functions.\r\nThis would apply most particularly, but not\r\nexclusively, to Security Council decisions, whose legal\r\nfoundations and motivations would be clearer to all States\r\nMembers of the Organization. This could only result in a\r\nstricter and sounder application of the provisions of\r\nArticle 24. The Security Council itself would be\r\nstrengthened, in that it would be acting completely on\r\nbehalf of the States Members of the Organization and in\r\nabsolute conformity with the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations, as expressly provided for in Article 24 of\r\nthe Charter, to which I referred a moment ago.\r\nIn embarking resolutely and collectively on this\r\nprocess of revitalizing the activities of the International\r\nCourt of Justice, we would be making a contribution to\r\nachieving one of the four main objectives of the United\r\nNations Decade for International Law, namely,\r\n“To promote means and methods for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States,\r\nincluding resort to and full respect for the\r\nInternational Court of Justice” (resolution 48/30,\r\nsecond preambular paragraph, (b)).\r\nThe small number of statements in this debate on the\r\nannual report of the International Court of Justice can be\r\ninterpreted as a sign of Member States’ respect for the\r\nCourt and as tacit consent for what it has done. But the\r\nCourt no doubt also needs the encouragement of Member\r\nStates, both from the political point of view and the point\r\nof view of making available to it the human and material\r\nresources it needs to carry out its noble task. The\r\nAlgerian delegation assures the President of the Court and\r\nhis distinguished colleagues in this Hall of its full support\r\non both scores.\r\nMr. Flores Olea (Mexico) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): We wish to express our heartfelt thanks to\r\nMr. Mohammed Bedjaoui for his excellent presentation\r\ntoday to the General Assembly of the report on the work\r\nof the International Court of Justice. We should like to\r\nexpress particular appreciation for the format and the\r\ncalibre of his report this morning. The fact that he shared\r\nwith the General Assembly his evaluation and analysis of\r\nthe all-important work of the Court and commented on\r\nthe Court’s recommendations and proposals cannot but\r\ngreatly enrich the work of this session.\r\nAt the same time, we wish to affirm our deep\r\ngratitude for the work done by Judges Eduardo Jiménez\r\nde Aréchaga, José María Ruda and Nikolai Tarassov, all\r\nof whom have died within the past year. Their\r\ncontributions to the Court and to the development of\r\ninternational law helped enhance the stature of the highest\r\ninternational judicial organ.\r\nInternational coexistence based on respect for the\r\nfundamental norms of law and justice is the best\r\nguarantee of peace. Recognizing this, the States that met\r\nat the San Francisco Conference set as one of their\r\nprimary objectives for the future United Nations the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of law and justice, and provided its Members\r\nwith an impartial and independent mechanism that would\r\nbe entrusted with resolving the disputes that might arise\r\nin the course of their mutual relations. That organ is the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nUnfortunately, international law is not in and of itself\r\na guarantee of peace; it must be accompanied by the\r\npolitical will of States to pledge themselves to use the\r\nmechanisms and to adhere to the norms that the law\r\nprovides for avoiding or resolving conflicts.\r\nMexico is among the States that have made a specific\r\ndeclaration recognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, in accordance with\r\nparagraphs 2 and 5 of Article 36 of its Statute. Such a\r\ndeclaration by other Members of the United Nations, and\r\nespecially those that have major responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, is highly\r\ndesirable; that would make clearer their confidence in and\r\nrespect for the Court.\r\nThe opportunity that Article 15, paragraph 2 of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations gives to Members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to receive the report of the highest\r\njudicial organ of the Organization is not, and must not be\r\nseen as, a mere formality. On the contrary, the presentation\r\nof the report is the best opportunity for the Court to inform\r\nthe Members of the United Nations of its progress in the\r\ninterpretation and the development of the norms of\r\ninternational law. It is also an opportunity for States to feel\r\nmore closely involved in the judicial work of, and the\r\ncreation of law by, this organ.\r\nWe quite understand that by its very nature the\r\nInternational Court of Justice is an independent organ, and\r\nthat its rulings are not and must not be called into question\r\nin any way. This means that the purpose of the present\r\nexercise should be to disseminate information to States on\r\nthe substantive work done by the Court during the past year\r\nso that we can make an objective and direct assessment of\r\nthe cases that are brought before the Court. This\r\nundoubtedly can have an impact on United Nations\r\nMembers’ perception of the Court, and it can contribute to\r\nbroadening communication and cooperation between the\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations.\r\nWe therefore invite the members of the General\r\nAssembly and the members of the Court themselves to\r\nreflect on the importance of these presentations of report,\r\nfor they serve as a real means of revitalizing the role and\r\nauthority of the International Court of Justice.\r\nAbiding by the law and applying it are, as we are all\r\naware, essential elements in present-day international\r\nrelations.\r\nMr. Azwai (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): My country’s delegation would like to\r\nassociate itself with other delegations in welcoming\r\nMr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, President of the International\r\nCourt of Justice, and in congratulating him on his detailed\r\nintroduction of the report of the Court to this session.\r\nThis report once again reflects the increasing confidence\r\nby the international community in the International Court\r\nof Justice.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations, in its first\r\nArticle, calls for the settlement of disputes between States\r\nin conformity with the principles of justice and\r\ninternational law. It is a source of satisfaction to us that\r\nthis approach has become one of the constants of the\r\npolicies pursued by most United Nations Members. This\r\nis evident in the record and the registry of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. Many States have chosen\r\nto have recourse to the Court to settle their differences\r\nand disputes and have accepted and implemented the\r\nCourt’s rulings. My country is one such State.\r\nOver the last three decades, the Court has considered\r\nthree cases to which the Jamahiriya was a party. The\r\nlatest was the ruling by the Court on the dispute over the\r\nAouzou Strip. This ruling is contained in sub-section 3 of\r\nthe part three of the report of the Court, which is before\r\nthe Assembly in document A/49/4. Libya accepted the\r\nruling, although it was not in its favour, and implemented\r\nit in the presence of the United Nations and under its\r\nsupervision, as shown in document S/1994/657. This\r\nposition was appreciated by the Secretary-General, as\r\nstated in his report (S/1994/672), and also by the Security\r\nCouncil, as contained in its resolution 926 (1994).\r\nWe all have welcomed the easing of tensions in\r\ninternational relations. The coming period will witness\r\nattempts by the international community to build a new\r\nworld order. If this order is to become permanent and\r\nfair, it should be based, in the view of my country, on the\r\nrule of law and respect for international law. In this\r\ncontext, the International Court of Justice has a central\r\nrole to play. For such a role to be effective, it is essential\r\nto demonstrate more commitment to the role of the Court\r\nand to have recourse to it more often in the settlement of\r\ndisputes. It is equally important also to accept the Court’s\r\nrulings — past and future — on each and every dispute\r\nreferred to it by the parties concerned. This applies\r\nspecially to the States that bear the greater responsibility\r\nwithin the United Nations for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Those States, whenever\r\nthey are parties to disputes, must demonstrate their\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\ncommitment to international law and respect of its rules by\r\naccepting and implementing the Court’s rulings. Indeed,\r\nsome of those States still refuse to have recourse to the\r\nCourt or to implement its rulings.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report entitled “An\r\nAgenda for Peace”, states that greater reliance on the\r\nInternational Court of Justice would be an important\r\ncontribution to United Nations peacemaking. My country\r\nagrees with this assessment and believes that this trend\r\nshould be strengthened and enhanced. It also believes that\r\nStates should be encouraged to have recourse to the Court\r\nand to make use of its potential to settle their disputes\r\nbefore taking them to other United Nations organs such as\r\nthe Security Council, as has happened in some cases. One\r\nexample is the dispute between my country and France,\r\nBritain and the United States of America which the\r\nJamahiriya has referred to the International Court of Justice.\r\nAlthough the dispute is still before the Court, the three\r\nStates resorted to the Security Council and pushed it to\r\nadopt certain resolutions pertaining to the dispute without\r\neven waiting for the Court’s decision. This is exactly what\r\nwe do not want.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I should\r\nlike to thank the President of the International Court of\r\nJustice, Judge Bedjaoui, and his colleagues who are present\r\ntoday. I should also like to thank all the Judges who are\r\nwith Judge Bedjaoui in this Hall for the excellent work they\r\nare doing in the Court.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 13?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I should\r\nlike to remind Member States that the deadline for\r\nsubmission, in writing, of their views on Programme 6 of\r\nthe medium-term plan, Elimination of apartheid, contained\r\nin document A/49/6, Programme 6, is Wednesday,\r\n26 October. This will allow sufficient time for transmission\r\nto the Fifth Committee.\r\nAgenda item 33\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters\r\nThe President (interpretation from French):\r\nMembers will recall that at its 104th meeting, held on\r\n14 September 1994, the General Assembly adopted\r\ndecision 48/498, by which the General Assembly decided\r\n“that the Open-ended Working Group [on the\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council] should\r\ncontinue its work, taking into account, inter alia, the\r\nviews expressed at the forty-ninth session, and\r\nsubmit a report to the General Assembly before the\r\nend of that session.”\r\nI should like to propose that the list of speakers in\r\nthe debate on this item be closed today at noon.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\ntherefore request those representatives wishing to\r\nparticipate in the debate to inscribe their names on the list\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): I wish to convey my\r\ndelegation’s deep appreciation to the Chairman of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador Samuel Insanally, and to\r\nhis two Vice-Chairmen for their fine efforts in steering\r\nthe work of the Working Group during the last session of\r\nthe General Assembly. My delegation welcomes the\r\ndecision that the Working Group should continue its work\r\nduring this session and submit a report to the General\r\nAssembly before the end of the session. We look forward,\r\nMr. President, to continuing our participation in the\r\ndeliberations of the Working Group under your able\r\nstewardship.\r\nMalaysia’s views on this item have already been\r\narticulated: at the last General Assembly session, at\r\nmeetings of the Open-ended Working Group, and recently\r\nby our Deputy Prime Minister in his address on 5 October\r\nduring the general debate. Our views were also reflected\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report, document A/48/264 of\r\n20 July 1993. Given the importance of this issue, we feel,\r\nhowever, that it is necessary today to reiterate some of\r\nthe points raised earlier by our delegation.\r\nThe current exercise pertaining to the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council should not be squandered if we want the\r\nUnited Nations to live up to its full potential as envisaged\r\nin the Charter. We should not allow any unpersuasive\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nclaims by some major Powers and others to stand in the\r\nway of timely and necessary change, change that would\r\nmake the Security Council more representative, effective,\r\ntransparent, democratic and accountable. These changes are\r\nvital in our collective efforts to enhance the legitimacy and\r\ncredibility of the Security Council. A reformed Security\r\nCouncil should serve the interests of all nations in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that a mere change in the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council would not be sufficient\r\nto ensure broad support for Council decisions without\r\nspecific changes in the Council’s working methods. We\r\nhave repeatedly said that expansion without reform of the\r\nCouncil’s working methods would be meaningless and\r\nundeserving of the interest of the entire membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. On the other hand, reform of the Council,\r\neven without expansion, would have some positive effect\r\non the effectiveness, credibility and legitimacy of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nAny reform which merely facilitates enlargement,\r\nspecifically through the increase of permanent membership\r\nby one or two or even three seats, to the exclusion of other\r\nequally important issues is certainly not acceptable to us.\r\nMy delegation is not convinced that merely adding two or\r\nmore permanent members to cushion the financial\r\nobligations of some veto-wielding Powers would really\r\nreform the Security Council. Furthermore, we have always\r\nquestioned the permanent status of some members of the\r\nSecurity Council, which is not consistent with the principles\r\nof the sovereign equality of States and democracy. We\r\ncannot accept a situation in which five members of the\r\nSecurity Council remain more powerful than the whole\r\nmembership of the United Nations.\r\nFrom the discussions in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup it is clear that there is a wide convergence of views\r\nover the need to improve the working methods and\r\nprocedures of the Security Council in order to enhance its\r\nefficiency. While recognizing that there have been some\r\npositive steps towards that end, my delegation is of the\r\nview that more could, and indeed should, be done by the\r\nSecurity Council. In this regard, the constructive proposals\r\nagreed to by the Non-Aligned Movement at its ministerial\r\nmeeting held in Cairo from 31 May to 3 June 1994 should\r\nbe given serious consideration with a view to their early\r\nadoption.\r\nThere is an urgent need to improve the relationship of\r\nthe Council with the General Assembly and with non-\r\nmembers of the Security Council. Decisions of the General\r\nAssembly must be made binding on the Council,\r\nparticularly those commanding overwhelming support. At\r\nthe same time, taking into account Article 29 of the\r\nCharter, the Council must ensure that it provides for\r\neffective interaction with the larger membership. For\r\ninstance, in the case of peace-keeping operations, the\r\nCouncil, which takes decisions on peace-keeping matters,\r\nmust create institutional mechanisms for consultation with\r\nthe troop contributors. After all, Article 44 of the Charter\r\nprovides for the participation of troop-contributing\r\ncountries not members of the Council in the decisions of\r\nthe Council concerning employment of contingents of\r\nthose Members’ armed forces.\r\nOn the question of enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil’s membership, we agree that the increase should\r\nbe large enough to represent all 184 Members effectively.\r\nThe current distortion in the distribution of seats in the\r\nSecurity Council to the benefit of mostly European and\r\nother Western countries should be rectified as a matter of\r\npriority. Since the Security Council derives its moral\r\nlegitimacy from its balanced representative character, it is\r\nnecessary that its future composition be reflective of the\r\ncurrent realities. My delegation is prepared to consider the\r\nvarious models of ratio increase proposed by some\r\ndelegations with a view to finding a workable and\r\nacceptable ratio. While recognizing the need to have an\r\nouter limit, we would like to stress that our debate on the\r\nneed to ensure equitable representation should not be\r\nsubsumed in our preoccupation with numbers. We should\r\nnot be too obsessed with the numbers game. Any formula\r\nthat would ensure the greatest degree of representation\r\nand equity should be acceptable to us.\r\nIt is the view of my delegation that the best possible\r\noption to address the problem of both over-representation\r\nand the absence of equitable representation in the Security\r\nCouncil is to increase the number of seats for non-\r\npermanent members. This is necessary and timely in the\r\nlight of the current realities and in keeping with the\r\nsignificant increase in the membership of the United\r\nNations to 184.\r\nThe expansion of the Security Council should be\r\nseen from the regional perspective so as to ensure proper\r\nregional representation, in terms of both quantitative and\r\nqualitative aspects. It is the view of my delegation that\r\nregional representation should not be on the basis of the\r\nbiggest and the most powerful in a given region, but,\r\nmore importantly, on the basis of the dynamics operating\r\nin the region and the arrangements developed there. If\r\nregional organizations provide the interlocking network\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nfor globalism, clearly the permanent interests of regions\r\nmust be given pre-eminence.\r\nAnother equally important aspect that we are seeking\r\nin the reform exercise is the elimination of the veto. My\r\ndelegation has always questioned the continuing relevance\r\nof the veto in the light of some unhealthy trends in the\r\nSecurity Council, where only one Power or group of\r\nPowers increasingly appears to be taking control of\r\ndecision-making. In this regard, my delegation would like\r\nto reiterate that the veto should be abolished for the\r\nfollowing reasons:\r\nFirst, the victorious Powers of 1945, which accorded\r\nthemselves special privileges as permanent members, are no\r\nlonger the exclusive pre-eminent Powers, as new centres of\r\npower have since emerged. Therefore, in our view, the veto\r\nis obsolete in the context of current realities.\r\nSecondly, the right of veto undermines the principle of\r\nthe sovereign equality of States as provided for in the\r\nCharter.\r\nThirdly, the veto undermines the concept of collective\r\nsecurity of States as enshrined in the Charter. As we\r\nindicated in our submission to the Secretary-General,\r\n“no country, however powerful, should arbitrarily\r\nstand in the path of collective needs as determined by\r\nthe general membership of the United Nations”.\r\n(A/48/264, p. 59)\r\nFourthly, the veto power allows the permanent\r\nmembers to protect or shield any States they desire from\r\nthe governance of the Security Council. An assessment of\r\nutilization of the veto would indicate that it is being used\r\nin support of partisan and national interests rather that in\r\ndefence of issues and principles and in the interests of the\r\ninternational community in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nFifthly, the threat of the use of the veto is often used\r\neven to prevent or delay a request for debate intended to\r\nallow the general membership to make its pronouncements\r\non critical issues relating to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nFinally, the veto marginalizes the role of the non-\r\npermanent members.\r\nMr. Yassin (Sudan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nMy delegation is fully aware that no permanent\r\nmember will at present accept a Charter amendment that\r\nresults in the abolition of the veto power. In this regard,\r\nmy delegation shares the views of those delegations that\r\nhave proposed restrictions on the application of that\r\npower. The details of our proposal will be raised when\r\nthe Working Group convenes.\r\nIn their statements during the general debate most\r\ndelegations, including my own, spoke of the need to\r\nreform the Security Council. A number of interesting\r\nproposals advanced during the general debate merit our\r\nserious consideration. My delegation will study all those\r\nproposals carefully.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to reiterate\r\nthat any exercise relating to the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil should be carried out in a comprehensive manner\r\nand should include not only the question of membership,\r\nbut also the veto power and voting, working methods of\r\nthe Security Council and the relationship between the\r\nCouncil and other organs of the United Nations. It is our\r\nhope that the outcome of this exercise will enhance the\r\nlegitimacy, representativeness and effectiveness of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Chew (Singapore): Allow me first to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his unanimous election.\r\nI am confident that under his leadership the Assembly\r\nwill achieve its objectives. I would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to thank Mr. Essy’s predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Insanally, for his guidance in making the\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly a success.\r\nIn his capacity as Chairman of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup established to consider this item by resolution\r\n48/26, Ambassador Insanally brought greater focus and\r\nclarity to the issues which have to be addressed before we\r\ncan arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.\r\nThe item we are considering today, “Question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related matters”,\r\nwas introduced 15 years ago at the thirty-fourth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. In the intervening years it\r\nlanguished. With the end of the cold war, the Security\r\nCouncil began to achieve much of its envisaged role in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. This,\r\ntogether with the marked increase in United Nations\r\nmembership, led to renewed calls for the Security Council\r\nto be more representative of the Organization as a whole,\r\nfor improvements in its relationship with other organs of\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nthe United Nations, and for improvements in its working\r\nmethods.\r\nAt the forty-eighth session, last year, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Singapore devoted his entire statement\r\nin the general debate to the question of the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council. The purpose of the Singapore statement\r\nwas to stimulate discussions on this important issue with a\r\nview to making progress. As stated by my Foreign\r\nMinister:\r\n“... there is no alternative but gradually to shape a\r\nconsensus through a patient process of debate and\r\ndiscussion”. (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-eighth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n18th meeting, p. 18)\r\nWe are pleased that the process of debate and\r\ndiscussion has since taken off. Progress has been made in\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group as delegations have begun\r\nto conduct substantive discussions of the issues. However,\r\nfor a consensus to emerge more needs to be done. This is\r\nespecially so if, as some representatives have advocated, we\r\nare to achieve consensus before the end of the fiftieth\r\nsession.\r\nIt is our view that the following will need to be done\r\nto shape a consensus.\r\nFirst, the issues of an increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and other matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council must become priority issues for\r\nGovernments. Unless capitals become seized of these issues\r\nand have clear visions of the role of the United Nations in\r\nthe next 50 years, we will not achieve much here in New\r\nYork. At the moment, many of the views expressed in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group tend to be general in nature\r\nand to be reiterations of known positions.\r\nSecondly, the implications of those specific proposals\r\nthrown out during the discussions in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group and in the recently concluded general\r\ndebate must be critically examined. These proposals have\r\nraised a number of questions which will need to be fully\r\naddressed if progress is to be made.\r\nThirdly, in any discussion of the question of expansion\r\nof the Council, there will have to be serious and concerted\r\nexamination of objective criteria for new permanent\r\nmembers. In his statement my Minister called for the\r\nformulation of:\r\n“... agreed objective criteria for the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council, especially its permanent\r\nmembers”. (ibid.)\r\nSome countries view the establishment of objective\r\ncriteria to be unnecessary. They claim that eventually\r\npolitical considerations will determine who the new\r\npermanent members will be. Others have asked: what\r\nshould constitute such objective criteria? We have no\r\ndoubt that in the final analysis political considerations\r\nwill play a part in our decisions. However, we will still\r\nneed to have objective criteria to guide our political\r\ndecisions. As to what should constitute objective criteria,\r\nwe need only look at the role of the Security Council as\r\ndefined in the United Nations Charter to answer this\r\nquestion. The Security Council has primary responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe objective criteria must therefore be intimately linked\r\nto the ability of countries to contribute to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nProgress on this item will be hesitant at best unless\r\nthere is political will to push ahead. We cannot achieve\r\nconsensus in the Working Group unless there is a genuine\r\ndesire on the part of Member States to negotiate seriously\r\nand to make the necessary compromises. But we should\r\nalso deliberate carefully, because the decisions taken on\r\nthis important issue will have a profound impact on the\r\nability of the Security Council and the United Nations as\r\na whole to maintain international peace and security in\r\nthe decades ahead. My delegation will do its utmost to\r\nmake constructive contributions to the process of\r\nconsensus-building on this important item.\r\nMr. Hurst (Antigua and Barbuda): This is the first\r\ntime I have had the opportunity to address the Assembly\r\nsince Mr. Amara Essy was elected President; let me\r\ntherefore congratulate him warmly on behalf of the\r\nAntigua and Barbuda delegation. His election is a tribute\r\nto his experience and a testimony to his outstanding\r\nabilities. My delegation is confident that under his able\r\nstewardship the Assembly will succeed in advancing the\r\nnoble aims and objectives of the Charter.\r\nWhen my Prime Minister addressed this deliberative\r\nbody a week ago, he said the following:\r\n“No State or group of States can proclaim the\r\noverarching importance of democracy, nor can any\r\nnation or group of States claim to intervene in\r\nanother State in the interest of upholding democracy,\r\nif that nation or group of States is unwilling to\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\ndemocratize the Security Council itself. ... The time\r\nhas come for equity for all nations — large and\r\nsmall — in the membership of the Council.” (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 20th Meeting, p. 19)\r\nIn the short time allotted each delegation in this\r\ndebate, Antigua and Barbuda would wish to expand on\r\nthese remarks and to make pellucid its position on Security\r\nCouncil reform, without necessarily repeating, although\r\nabiding by, the statements my delegation made during\r\ndebates at the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation regards as established wisdom the view\r\nthat Security Council decision-making will be the most\r\nsignificant factor in fashioning a new world order in the\r\npost-cold-war world. My delegation also regards as\r\nestablished wisdom the view that small States require the\r\nprotection offered by the Security Council much more than\r\ndo large States. As a small State, Antigua and Barbuda\r\nregards adherence to international law as a cardinal rule\r\nfrom which no State should ever deviate; given their\r\nrelative inability to defend themselves militarily, small\r\nStates must depend on the strictures of international law to\r\ndeter external aggression.\r\nHow then does a small and militarily weak State, that\r\ndoes not produce oil and that dwells on the periphery of the\r\neconomic system, compel the attention of the Security\r\nCouncil at a time of crisis? It is my delegation’s view that\r\nto succeed in receiving so much as an attentive glance there\r\nmust be equity for all nations — large and small — in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council.\r\nIn this context, “equity” means that decision-making\r\nwithin the Security Council must take into account the\r\nviews of small States. Given the present configuration of\r\nthe Security Council, small States must be seated at the\r\nCouncil table if it is to be said that their views count and\r\nthat equity prevails. The present debate seems to be reduced\r\nto the question whether two additional large and wealthy\r\nStates are to realize their ambition of being included in the\r\nroster of the permanent membership of the Council. Such\r\na debate excludes the principle of equity for all nations,\r\nlarge and small.\r\nThe discussion will thus appear unnecessary and\r\nwasteful if the only criterion for membership remains the\r\neconomic wealth of aspirant States. That approach harks\r\nback to the days of colonial rule in Antigua and Barbuda\r\nwhen the privilege of offering oneself as a candidate for\r\nparliament was limited to those who possessed valuable\r\nproperty; that inequity was outlawed in 1951 in my small\r\ncountry when adult suffrage became the law.\r\nIn 1945, six years before that historic event, the\r\nUnited Nations was created. Eight months from today, the\r\nUnited Nations will mark 50 years since the signing of\r\nthe Charter. The United Nations Charter proclaims that its\r\nMembers are determined\r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights ... in\r\nthe equal rights of men and women and of nations\r\nlarge and small”.\r\nBut can its large and powerful Members truly proclaim\r\nthat they are abiding by its Charter if small nations are\r\nexcluded by deliberate design from the halls of decision-\r\nmaking? Can its large Members truly proclaim that they\r\nare abiding by its Charter when the possession of wealth\r\nappears to be the only criterion for inclusion in Security\r\nCouncil membership and decision-making?\r\nThere is an urgent need for large and wealthy States\r\nto engage in meaningful dialogue with small and poor\r\nStates in the Councils of this parliament of parliaments.\r\nSmall and poor States will not depend upon goodwill; the\r\nUnited Nations Charter obliges Member States to sit in\r\ncounsel with those reliant upon the Council’s decision-\r\nmaking powers.\r\nAs we enter the twenty-first century, the United\r\nNations will become more important, not less; the\r\nobligation of history and the legacy of those who\r\nstruggled to make membership within the United Nations\r\na reality for small and poor nations, like mine, imposes\r\non my generation a commitment to stand guard against\r\nthe privilege which prevailed in the age of its founding.\r\nThat is a charge we shall never surrender.\r\nWe continue to abide by our earlier proposals for\r\nequitable geographical representation on an enlarged\r\nSecurity Council along the following lines: within the\r\nAfrican States, one permanent member and six non-\r\npermanent members; for the Asian States, two permanent\r\nmembers and three non-permanent members; for the\r\nEastern European States, one permanent member and two\r\nnon-permanent members; for the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States, one permanent member and three non-\r\npermanent members; for the Western European and Other\r\nStates, three permanent members and three non-permanent\r\nmembers.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nThis arrangement, in our view, encompasses equity for\r\nall nations, large and small. Our ambition, as our Prime\r\nMinister has declared, is after all to democratize the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Wisnumurti (Indonesia): Indonesia’s position on\r\nthe question of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council was clearly stated\r\nby our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ali Alatas, during the\r\ngeneral debate earlier this month. It is therefore not the\r\nintention of the Indonesian delegation to express itself on\r\nthe matter now.\r\nIt is a distinct honour and privilege for me to speak on\r\nbehalf of the non-aligned countries on the agenda item\r\nbefore us.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express our\r\nappreciation to Ambassador Insanally of Guyana, President\r\nof the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, who\r\nserved ably as Chairman of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council. Our\r\ncommendations also go to the two Vice-Chairmen,\r\nAmbassador Wilhelm Breitenstein of Finland and\r\nAmbassador Chew Tai Soo of Singapore.\r\nRecent developments in the global landscape have\r\nplaced the Security Council in a position of increasing\r\nimportance with ramifications for the work of the\r\nOrganization and beyond. Numerous circumstances have\r\nalso contributed to an unprecedented number of activities\r\nbeing undertaken by this body. From dealing with conflict\r\nsituations in various parts of the world that threaten peace\r\nand security, to the expansion of peace-keeping activities,\r\nthe Council has had an active agenda and its capacity to\r\nrespond has, at times, been adversely affected. The new\r\ncooperative spirit prevailing among its members has\r\nallowed them to take a number of unanimous positions on\r\nsome of the most critical and complex issues, while we are\r\nalso cognizant of the fact that it has failed to address\r\neffectively certain other issues. The Council has thus\r\nreached a critical turning-point in its history and members\r\nlook forward to a more effective role now that the obstacles\r\nwhich paralysed it for so long have been removed.\r\nIt is in this light that the Movement of Non-Aligned\r\nCountries views the question of increasing the membership\r\nof the Security Council. It is pertinent to recall that\r\nendeavours to achieve this objective initiated a decade and\r\na half ago have lagged behind and somehow remained\r\nbeyond the purview of a broad and far-reaching process of\r\nreform and revitalization of the United Nations itself. In\r\n1946, the United Nations had 51 Members, six of which\r\nwere non-permanent members of the Security Council. In\r\n1965, when the membership had grown to 113, there was\r\na corresponding increase in the non-permanent members\r\nto 10. But despite the fact that more than a quarter\r\ncentury has elapsed while the membership has increased\r\nto 184, there has been no further increase in the Council’s\r\nmembership.\r\nThe tenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nheld in Jakarta in September 1992, expressed the position\r\nof the Movement on the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council as contained in the Final Documents,\r\nissued as document A/47/675 of 18 November 1992.\r\nLikewise, at the eleventh Ministerial Conference of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, held in Cairo in June of this\r\nyear, the Movement stated its position on the subject as\r\nreflected in the Final Document of the Conference, issued\r\nas document A/49/287 of 29 July 1994, the relevant\r\nparagraphs of which have been submitted to the Open-\r\nended Working Group.\r\nMore recently, on 5 October 1994, the Ministers of\r\nForeign Affairs and Heads of Delegation of the non-\r\naligned countries further considered the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and adopted a\r\nCommuniqué. In this respect I wish to quote the relevant\r\nparagraphs of that Communiqué, as follows:\r\n“The Ministers and Heads of Delegation,\r\nhaving noted the report on the progress and work of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and other\r\nmatters related to the Security Council, reaffirmed\r\ntheir view that both the reform and expansion\r\naspects of the Security Council, including its\r\ndecision-making process and procedures, should be\r\nexamined as integral parts of a common package,\r\ntaking into account the principle of sovereign\r\nequality of States, criteria such as equitable\r\ngeographical distribution, and the need for\r\ntransparency, accountability and democratization.\r\nThey expressed their concern that non-aligned\r\ncountries were extremely under-represented in the\r\nCouncil and underlined that the proposed\r\nenlargement should, therefore, be comprehensive in\r\nnature so as to enhance the credibility of the Council\r\nand to reflect the universal character of the world\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nbody. In this context, the Ministers recalled the\r\nrelevant decisions of the Jakarta Summit and urged\r\nthat the non-aligned countries should work towards\r\nincreasing their representation in the Security Council.\r\n“The Ministers and Heads of Delegation urged\r\nthe Working Group to determine the extent and nature\r\nof expansion and its modalities. Any predetermined\r\nselection excluding the non-aligned and other\r\ndeveloping countries would be unacceptable to the\r\nMovement. They stressed the importance, as proposed\r\nin the Cairo Ministerial Conference, of enhancing the\r\neffective and efficient functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil by adopting measures geared at reforming its\r\nworking methods and procedures and improving the\r\nrelationship of the Council with the General Assembly\r\nand non-permanent members of the Security Council.\r\nIn this context, they decided that the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement address specific measures called for by the\r\nCairo Ministerial Conference before the\r\ncommencement of the next round of consultations of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group and reiterated their\r\nconviction that the Open-ended Working Group of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council should take priority action on\r\nthese measures.”\r\nI have just presented the position of the non-aligned\r\ncountries on the question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters. To conclude, I wish to state that the non-\r\naligned countries deem it essential for the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group to continue its work in order to fulfil its\r\nmandate as contained in General Assembly resolution\r\n48/26. We therefore support its recommendation, as\r\nindicated in paragraph 9 of its report, that it continue its\r\nwork at the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe non-aligned countries wish to reiterate their\r\ncommitment to participate constructively in the\r\ndeliberations of the Working Group on an increase of the\r\nmembership of the Security Council in the firm conviction\r\nthat an intensified dialogue on this issue will be in the\r\nbroader interests of all Member States.\r\nMr. Kalpagé (Sri Lanka): Sri Lanka was one of the\r\ncountries that in 1979 called for the inclusion of this item\r\nin the agenda of the thirty-fourth session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly.\r\nDuring the forty-eighth session, the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group set up to discuss the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council brought into focus a number of concerns\r\nrelating to the Council. The discussions in the Working\r\nGroup clearly indicated certain important considerations\r\nthat need to be borne in mind during the forty-ninth\r\nsession:\r\nThe increase in the membership of the United\r\nNations and the extension of the Council into radically\r\nnew areas of activity necessitate a review of the\r\nmembership and other aspects of the Council’s\r\nfunctioning: the wide participation in the Working\r\nGroup’s meetings is a clear indication of the keen interest\r\nof all Member States in this item; the rich exchange of\r\nviews revealed varying perceptions on the complex issues\r\nbefore the Working Group; although reaching consensus\r\non major issues was difficult, the discussions in the\r\nWorking Group helped to identify positions of individual\r\ndelegations and to assess the nature of the questions we\r\nface.\r\nThe report (A/48/47) submitted under this item was\r\nadopted by consensus in the Working Group. However,\r\nthe report does not indicate the full range of the views\r\nexpressed, and this in our view is a great pity.\r\nIn a sense, given the far-reaching import of the\r\nissues involved, it may not be surprising that consensus\r\nremained elusive on the major issues. We therefore\r\nwelcome the fact that the Open-ended Working Group\r\nwill continue to develop its work, taking into account the\r\nviews that have already been expressed at the forty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nAs my delegation has already stated in the meetings\r\nof the Working Group, two major categories of proposals\r\nand suggestions emanated from the dialogues during the\r\nlast session.\r\nFirst, there are those reforms in the working methods\r\nof the Council that have been welcomed by all. These\r\nhave led to a greater degree of openness and transparency\r\nin the work of the Council. We feel that many of the\r\nenlightened measures taken by the Council should be\r\nconsidered part of its regular working methods rather than\r\nas a reflection of the initiative or working “style” of\r\nindividual Member States that presided over it. Sri Lanka\r\nis well aware that the Security Council still works on the\r\nbasis of “provisional” rules of procedure and that formally\r\nsetting down the recent reforms and institutionalizing\r\nthem may not be easy. We would, however, have\r\nwelcomed at least a statement from the Security Council\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nnoting — and blessing, if you will — the changes that have\r\nbeen welcomed by all members. We hope that the process\r\nwill continue and that these changes will become a matter\r\nof course.\r\nSecondly, there are those proposals relating to the\r\nincrease in the membership of the Council that require\r\namendment of the Charter. That the Council should increase\r\nits membership has been universally accepted. There are\r\ndivergent views on the extent of the increase. Sri Lanka\r\nfeels that a modest increase of up to a maximum of 25\r\nwould keep the Council within acceptable proportions for\r\ndecisive action and yet provide a means of ensuring more\r\nequitable representation for the regions of Africa, Asia and\r\nLatin America, which are currently underrepresented in the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe question of the number of permanent members in\r\nthe Council has been much more controversial. Sri Lanka’s\r\nown position has been that new realities — political,\r\nmilitary, economic — as well as other factors which\r\ncharacterize the international scene today call for an\r\nadjustment in respect of the permanent members of the\r\nCouncil. It is necessary to consider seriously the eligibility\r\nof additional States, including non-aligned States, for\r\npermanent membership in the Council. A number of\r\ncountries have been mentioned, discussed and advocated as\r\nqualifying for permanent membership in the Council in\r\nterms of the new international realities. Some of the\r\narguments advanced in favour of those other countries are\r\nat least as cogent today as were the arguments considered\r\nvalid when the present five permanent members were\r\ndetermined. The ultimate criterion should be the\r\nacceptability of a Member before the general membership.\r\nSri Lanka does not wish to anticipate discussions in\r\nthe Working Group at this current session. However, we do\r\nfeel that action should be taken in respect of those\r\nproposals that do not require amendment of the Charter. We\r\nbelieve that such changes, which have come to be called\r\n“soft options”, have the following undeniable advantages:\r\nfirst, they will not be any impediment to the Council’s\r\npresent level of effectiveness, its speed or its efficiency of\r\noperations; secondly, they will indeed only serve to enhance\r\nthe Council’s credibility and representative character and\r\ngive its decisions and actions greater, if not universal,\r\nacceptability; lastly, they will be major confidence-building\r\nmeasures that would help develop a healthy nexus between\r\nthe Security Council and the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations on whose behalf the Council must act in\r\naccordance with the Charter.\r\nThe standardization of these so-called soft options\r\nshould not in any way imply that the more radical\r\nchanges necessitating Charter amendment should be set\r\naside or delayed. It is important to pursue action on both.\r\nHowever, where agreement is possible on the soft\r\noptions, they should not be held hostage until such time\r\nas agreement has been reached on the more difficult, and\r\nindeed more vital, areas of Security Council reform which\r\nrequire amendment of the Charter.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to thank Ambassador Samuel\r\nInsanally, President of the Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession, and the two Vice-Chairmen of the Working\r\nGroup, the Permanent Representative of Finland,\r\nAmbassador Wilhelm Breitenstein, and the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Singapore, Ambassador Chew Tai Soo,\r\nfor the exemplary manner in which they guided the\r\ndeliberations in the Working Group.\r\nSri Lanka looks forward to participating, under the\r\nPresident’s guidance, in the Working Group this year\r\nduring the forty-ninth session. We sincerely hope that it\r\nwould then be possible to reach more definite agreement,\r\nwhich would make the Security Council more effective\r\nand more responsive to the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. This is essential at a time when the\r\nOrganization is faced with new challenges.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation wishes to congratulate Ambassador Insanally,\r\nChairman of the Open-ended Working Group, and the two\r\nVice-Chairmen, the Permanent Representatives of\r\nSingapore and Finland, for having effectively guided the\r\nWorking Group in its initial rounds of deliberations.\r\nThe Philippine delegation believes the time has come\r\nfor Member States to undertake a more detailed\r\nexamination of the various issues relating to the\r\nexpansion and reform of the Security Council. In this\r\nregard, delegations should be prepared to offer and\r\nconsider specific proposals by the time the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group reconvenes — we hope by early next\r\nyear. Above all, we should attempt to translate, where\r\npossible, our general positions into detailed negotiating\r\nproposals.\r\nOur fundamental view is that any enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council should be firmly based on the principle\r\nof the sovereign equality of States, equitable geographical\r\ndistribution and the need to create greater transparency,\r\naccountability and democratization. Furthermore, we\r\nbelieve the effectiveness and efficiency of an enlarged\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nCouncil would not necessarily be inversely related to its\r\nsize.\r\nIn fact, wider membership would lead to a more\r\ndemocratic decision-making process and, ultimately, to\r\nmore active support for decisions, as well as participation\r\nin operations arising from such decisions. That is why, in\r\nour view, an expansion by four or five seats might not be\r\nfully consistent with these concerns.\r\nIncreasing the membership of the Council is also\r\nimportant in view of the growth in the membership of the\r\nOrganization and of the extreme under-representation of\r\ndeveloping countries in the Council. Failure to address this\r\nsituation meaningfully would tend to undermine the\r\ncredibility of the Council and the universal character of\r\nUnited Nations decision-making.\r\nWe therefore believe that the Working Group should\r\nbegin to focus on specific proposals relating to the\r\nfollowing matters: the total size of any increase; the size of\r\nany increase in existing categories; new categories, such as\r\nsemi-permanent or quasi-permanent membership, or\r\nmembership based on rotation, and the total membership in\r\nsuch categories; and criteria for possible new permanent\r\nmembers and/or membership in new categories. In\r\nconnection with the last point, it should be stressed that the\r\ncriteria for non-permanent members are already specified in\r\nArticle 23(1) of the Charter. We should also examine in\r\ndetail the responsibilities and privileges of members of the\r\nCouncil — particularly the use of the veto.\r\nMoreover, it is fairly clear that these issues are\r\ninterrelated. The Working Group should therefore decide on\r\nan appropriate arrangement for considering them\r\nsimultaneously or as a package when necessary, bearing in\r\nmind the need for full transparency.\r\nThe “related matters” to which this agenda item on the\r\nSecurity Council refers are an equally important aspect of\r\nthe item. In this regard, the Philippine delegation is anxious\r\nnot to lose the momentum achieved in the Working Group,\r\nas reflected in the statements of a significant number of\r\ndelegations, which generally cited an urgent need for the\r\nSecurity Council to adopt effective measures aimed at\r\nenhancing its relationship with the General Assembly, with\r\nother United Nations bodies and with the general\r\nmembership. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has\r\nalso proposed a set of measures on the other matters\r\ncontained in its Cairo Declaration, which was adopted last\r\nJune.\r\nMember States should advance the work on the other\r\nmatters by building upon and refining the various\r\nmeasures already proposed or the proposals circulated in\r\nthe Working Group, which the Security Council could\r\nundertake in addition to those it has recently instituted. To\r\nfacilitate this task, we reiterate our support for the\r\nestablishment by the Open-ended Working Group of an\r\ninformal drafting body to consider all proposals made in\r\nconnection with improving the Council’s decision-making\r\nprocesses and procedures.\r\nMy delegation further proposes that the Working\r\nGroup examine, as a priority, proposals on the other\r\nmatters in the context of two mutually reinforcing and\r\ninterrelated categories of measures.\r\nThe first category would consist of measures aimed\r\nat improving the Security Council’s working relationship\r\nand interaction with the General Assembly, with other\r\nbodies and with the non-members of the Council. These\r\ncould include improved reports from the Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in line with General Assembly\r\nresolution 48/26; structured and more frequent\r\nconsultations on United Nations peace-keeping operations\r\nbetween the Council and troop-contributing countries; and\r\nthe creation by the Council of subsidiary organs — a\r\nmatter referred to in Article 29 of the Charter.\r\nThe second category would include measures dealing\r\nwith the Council’s working methods and decision-making\r\nprocedures: the holding of more frequent open meetings\r\nbefore the adoption of a particular resolution or decision\r\nof the Council; a written summary of proceedings in the\r\ninformal consultations of the whole, to be made available\r\nto the general membership; and structured briefings on\r\nparticularly urgent issues considered in the informal\r\nconsultations of the whole, similar to those provided for\r\nthe press corps.\r\nThe Philippine delegation hopes to contribute\r\ntowards significant progress on this agenda item during\r\nthe current session. We believe, however, that, in terms\r\nof the pace of work, both the expansion issues and the\r\nother matters — although these are obviously interrelated\r\nand mutually reinforcing — need not be strictly linked.\r\nThe adoption of a more flexible approach in the\r\nconsideration of these issues would facilitate the Working\r\nGroup’s ability to advance its work on the ones in respect\r\nof which there is a high degree of convergence or\r\nconsensus. This would be done, of course, without\r\nprejudice to the work in the other areas. Ultimately, we\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nbelieve, progress in one area would contribute to progress\r\nin others.\r\nMr. Graf zu Rantzau (Germany): We have come a\r\nlong way since we discussed the agenda item “Question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the membership\r\nof the Security Council” a year ago at the General\r\nAssembly’s forty-eighth session. Through the creation of an\r\ninformal Working Group it was possible to focus the\r\ndiscussion on the core of the problem and to provide all\r\nMember States with an opportunity to present their views.\r\nI want to express particular thanks to Ambassador\r\nInsanally, the Working Group’s Chairman, and to his Vice-\r\nChairmen, Ambassador Breitenstein and Ambassador Chew,\r\nfor the excellent work they have done.\r\nWe have now arrived at a point where the general\r\nexchange of views has run its course and an in-depth\r\ndiscussion of concrete reform proposals must begin.\r\nStatements made during the general debate of the forty-\r\nninth session confirm this view. With regard to substance,\r\nthe past year’s discussion has brought about growing\r\nconsensus among Member States on the central point with\r\nregard to this exercise — that the Security Council shall be\r\nenlarged.\r\nFour key elements appear to be essential, plausible and\r\nnecessary to any Security Council reform. First, all world\r\nregions should be equitably represented on the Security\r\nCouncil. In particular, the regions of Africa, Asia and Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean need stronger representation.\r\nSecondly, countries that are able and willing to contribute\r\non a global scale to the maintenance of peace and security\r\nand are already shouldering a large responsibility in respect\r\nof international development and United Nations activities\r\nshould be permanently represented on the Council. Thirdly,\r\nthe general membership of the United Nations should have\r\nthe potential to be represented on the Council more often.\r\nFourthly, the Security Council’s work must be carried out\r\nin an open and transparent manner to enable non-members\r\nto receive all the information they require. Also, all\r\nMember States should have a better opportunity to provide\r\ninput for the Council’s work.\r\nWe therefore support an increase in the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council to\r\nallow both a better representation of the regions that are\r\ncurrently underrepresented and a more adequate\r\nrepresentation of countries which shoulder a large share of\r\nthe United Nations overall burden.\r\nGermany would support proposals to create\r\nadditional permanent seats for countries from the regions\r\nof Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. As\r\nfar as we are concerned, we have repeatedly made it clear\r\nin the past and we state again today that we are willing\r\nand prepared to shoulder the special responsibilities\r\nderiving from permanent membership. In this context, it\r\nappears essential to us that all permanent members have\r\nnot only equal responsibilities but also equal rights.\r\nShould agreement not be possible now with regard\r\nto permanent seats for countries from the regions of\r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, the\r\nfollowing alternative could be considered.\r\nTo improve the possibilities of representation from\r\nthe regions, paragraph 2 of Article 23 of the United\r\nNations Charter should be amended to allow the re-\r\nelection of Member States to the Security Council. At the\r\nsame time, the number of non-permanent seats ought to\r\nbe increased in favour of these regions. As a\r\nconsequence, countries with the ability and willingness to\r\ncontribute more than the average to United Nations\r\nactivities and the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity could serve on the Council on a more frequent or\r\neven continuous basis. In order to enable the largest\r\ncontributors to the United Nations system, which share\r\nglobal responsibilities and which, together with the United\r\nStates, carry more than 50 per cent of all expenditures, to\r\nparticipate in the Council’s work, two permanent seats\r\nshould be added to the Security Council.\r\nProposals to introduce a third category of semi-\r\npermanent seats, would, in our view, not improve the\r\nchances for the large majority of Member States to serve\r\nmore often on the Council. In addition, such a proposal\r\nwould widen the gap between permanent and non--\r\npermanent members. It would marginalize the role and\r\npotential of a majority of the other countries to influence\r\nthe Council’s decisions. In the League of Nations, a\r\nsystem of several classes did not work. We cannot\r\nsupport such proposals. What is needed is not greater\r\ndivision but more homogeneity among the members of\r\nthe Council.\r\nWe are pleased that a broad consensus on the need\r\nfor a more open and transparent Security Council appears\r\nto have emerged. As a matter of fact, many steps have\r\nbeen taken already by the Security Council itself to\r\nprovide Member States not currently represented on the\r\nCouncil with better access to information about the\r\nCouncil’s proceedings. More improvements, such as\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nconsultation mechanisms with troop-contributing countries,\r\nare currently under discussion. My delegation understands\r\nand shares the frustration of non-members of the Security\r\nCouncil, which often feel uninformed about and locked out\r\nof Council decisions. We hope that the improvements made\r\nso far will be followed by additional steps to provide the\r\ngeneral membership with sufficient information and insight\r\nin the Security Council’s decision-making, thus allowing\r\nMember States to contribute their views and represent their\r\ninterests vis-à-vis the Security Council.\r\nWe have been pleased with the progress made to date\r\nin the discussion of this agenda item. Now concrete\r\nproposals must be discussed so that agreement on a reform\r\npackage which will serve the interests and the needs of the\r\noverwhelming majority of Member States can be reached.\r\nThe Security Council’s credibility and therefore its\r\neffectiveness depend on whether its composition is adapted\r\nto the new post-cold-war realities.\r\nMr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): At\r\nthe outset, I should like once again to congratulate\r\nMr. Essy on his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI would also be remiss in not taking this opportunity\r\nto commend the able and wise leadership of his\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Insanally, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Guyana, who led the Working Group in\r\na very efficient manner.\r\nI should also like to praise the sincere and constructive\r\nefforts of the members of the Bureau, the representatives of\r\nFinland and Singapore.\r\nThe question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council is\r\ngaining further importance in the eyes of the international\r\ncommunity. This is only natural and was to be expected in\r\nview of the rapid pace of changes and developments in the\r\nworld today. Interaction and cohesion are required of the\r\ncurrent international order in the face of such changes.\r\nThe contemporary world order has come a long way\r\nin laying the foundations of the fundamental concepts and\r\nprinciples of today’s international relations. Those concepts\r\nand principles are irreversible no matter how times and\r\ncircumstances may change. They constitute a valuable\r\ncontribution that enriches humanity and promotes its\r\ndevelopment. Those new concepts and principles have\r\nbecome acquired rights which all countries and peoples\r\ncherish. International developments require us to review,\r\nperiodically and sometimes comprehensively, certain\r\naspects of the international order so that it may not\r\nbecome dated and outstripped by events. We should make\r\nsure that the international order truly reflects current\r\ninternational realities.\r\nOne of the most important sources of commitment\r\nto the Security Council’s resolutions is the collective\r\ninternational will we know by the name of international\r\nlegality. This the elementary simple idea that lies behind\r\nthe new international order is exactly what we should\r\nenhance and reflect in the work of the Council and it\r\nshould be the ultimate objective in any process of\r\nreforming and developing the work of the Council.\r\nStrengthening the legality, which derives from the\r\nCharter, and which imparts to the Security Council’s\r\nresolutions their legitimacy, requires in the view of my\r\ndelegation: First, increasing membership of the Council.\r\nSuch increase should accurately reflect the realities of\r\ntoday’s world. Second, reviewing the Council’s decision-\r\nmaking procedures so that the Council, as stipulated in\r\nthe Charter, may genuinely act on behalf of all Member\r\nStates. Third, defining the framework of the exercise of\r\nveto power so that it may not be abused, either explicitly\r\nor implicitly.\r\nWith regard to the expansion of Council\r\nmembership, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his\r\nstatement to the General Assembly on 30 September,\r\nreferred to the parameters of Egypt’s position, which may\r\nbe summed up as follows: First, the increase in Council\r\nmembership should be limited and should be on a\r\nregional and not on a country-specific basis. Second, the\r\ncriteria stipulated by the Charter should be adhered to\r\nwith regard to the addition of new members to the\r\nCouncil. Third, the increase should reflect very accurately\r\nand honestly the political weight of regional Powers from\r\nall regions of the world, and the seats allocated to each\r\ngeographic region should be rotated among countries\r\nwhich meet the eligibility requirements.\r\nIn this regard, it is important to refer to a number\r\nof concrete proposals that were put forward during the\r\ngeneral debate and others that have been put forward\r\ntoday, such as those by Egypt, Italy and Australia, among\r\nothers. Those proposals could be discussed further,\r\ndeveloped and elaborated.\r\nWith regard to the decision-making process in the\r\nCouncil, it is important to take into account the need to\r\nenlarge the scope of consultation so that it may include\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nthe countries concerned in the region affected by the\r\nCouncil’s decision or resolution. In addition, troop-\r\ncontributing countries to peace-keeping operations should\r\nbe consulted, in accordance with Article 44 of the Charter.\r\nWe must also strengthen cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the relevant regional organizations, in\r\naccordance with and in application of Article 52 of the\r\nCharter. Consultations should not be confined to the stage\r\nof decision-making, but should, rather, take place at an\r\nearlier stage, and continue thereafter, in order to take\r\nadvantage of the expertise of regional Powers and\r\norganizations.\r\nWhile on the subject of the shortcomings of the\r\nCouncil’s work, we have to address the question of veto\r\npower in the Security Council and to mention that its\r\nfrequent use in the past prevented the Security Council and,\r\nindeed, the United Nations as a whole, from properly\r\nshouldering their responsibilities. Some may claim that the\r\nveto power is rarely exercised nowadays. This may be true,\r\nbut only in relation to the veto used in voting on draft\r\nresolutions. As for the threat to use the veto or what is\r\nknown as the covert veto, this is frequently resorted to\r\nduring the drafting and formulation of draft resolutions. So,\r\nthe practice is with us and has not stopped.\r\nNo one can be sure that in the future the Organization\r\nwill not find itself in tense circumstances similar to those\r\nthat pertained in the past, circumstances that would once\r\nagain render it unable to perform its functions and shoulder\r\nits responsibility. In dealing with the question of increasing\r\nthe membership of the Security Council, it has thus become\r\nimportant to determine the scope of the use of veto power\r\nby agreeing on clear criteria for the framework of its use.\r\nIn dealing with this subject it might be useful to go back to\r\nthe San Francisco Conference and to review the numerous\r\nattempts made at the beginning of that Conference, later in\r\nthe Security Council and then, for many years, in the\r\nGeneral Assembly, to differentiate between substantive\r\nissues and procedural matters. All such attempts failed. The\r\npermanent members did not succeed in imposing their\r\nviewpoint. To this day, the framework within which the\r\nveto power may be used has eluded definition.\r\nThe Egyptian delegation considers that to arrive at\r\nsuch definition, and thereby to enable the Council to\r\nperform in a better fashion, we can do one of two things:\r\nwe can either amend the Charter in such a way as to\r\nachieve the definition of the scope and limits of the veto,\r\nas the permanent members tried to do in San Francisco; or\r\nwe can amend and update the Council’s rules of procedure\r\nin a definitive manner, without need for amending the\r\nCharter, provided the rules included certain procedures\r\nrelating to the continuity and better performance of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn this connection, I should say, by way of example,\r\nthat we can consider four kinds of measures and\r\nprocedures that could constitute exemptions from the\r\nframework of veto power: first, special procedures related\r\nto fact-finding activities that are needed for the Council\r\nto function properly; secondly, dispatching United Nations\r\nobservers, at the request or with the consent of the host\r\ncountry, to monitor developments and inform the Council\r\nby submitting precise reports on the situation under\r\ndiscussion; thirdly, authorizing the Secretary-General to\r\ntake charge of certain tasks, in accordance with Article 98\r\nof the Charter, relating to the settlement of disputes, and\r\nrule 23 of the Security Council’s provisional rules of\r\nprocedure; and, fourthly, measures of a humanitarian\r\nnature, such as cease-fire resolutions, appeals to parties to\r\ncease hostilities and calls for respect for the Geneva\r\nConventions. Such matters should not be subject to veto\r\npower.\r\nThe work of the Working Group, over the past year,\r\nhas been limited to general statements and general\r\nexpressions of opinion. There have been no working\r\npapers containing clear, specific ideas that could become\r\na basis for negotiations. We should now move from the\r\nstage of general statements to a new stage of serious\r\nnegotiations and open-mindedness in order for the\r\nWorking Group to achieve tangible progress.\r\nThe objective we should strive to achieve in the\r\nfuture should be to reach consensus and thereby to reflect\r\nthe will of the overwhelming majority of the members of\r\nthe international community. It is not expected or\r\nacceptable that the viewpoint of the minority should be\r\nimposed upon the majority. The provisions of the Charter\r\nare crystal clear as far as the amendment is concerned;\r\nthe approval of one-third of the membership of the United\r\nNations is necessary. The two-thirds majority will not\r\naccept anything that runs counter to its vital interests. We\r\nhave started work, in the Working Group, on the basis of\r\nconsensus. The Egyptian delegation hope that this\r\nconsensus will continue.\r\nMr. Chaturvedi (India): As a Member State which\r\nhad the privilege of initiating the agenda item on the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, India is happy to\r\nparticipate in today’s debate. We are considering the item\r\nagainst the background of a full year of discussions in the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly under\r\nthe able guidance of the President of the forty-eighth\r\nsession and of the permanent representatives of Finland and\r\nSingapore. The Working Group had an extensive and\r\nintensive exchange of views on the issues related to the\r\nquestion, and the discussions gave us clear insight into the\r\nthinking of the States Members. I note that it is your\r\nintention, Mr. President, to lead the discussions of the\r\nWorking Group in the coming year. We hope that in the\r\nnext phase of the discussions we shall move on from\r\nexchange of ideas to consensus-building. Decisions on an\r\nissue as important as the structure, composition and\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council cannot be taken except\r\nby consensus.\r\nThe imperatives of expansion and reform of the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council have been well\r\nrecognized. Therefore, it is not necessary to go once again\r\ninto the arguments, such as the changed realities of the\r\nworld and the dramatic increase in the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. In fact, the report of the Working Group\r\nstates that\r\n“While there was a convergence of views that\r\nthe membership of the Security Council should\r\nbe enlarged, there was also agreement that the\r\nscope and nature of such enlargement require\r\nfurther discussion.” (A/48/47, para.8)\r\nAs for the working methods and procedures, it was\r\nrecognized that further measures were necessary to enhance\r\ntransparency and to reflect the democratic aspirations of the\r\nvast majority of Member States. In January 1992,\r\naddressing the Security Council summit, the Prime Minister\r\nof India observed that\r\n“As the composition of the General Assembly\r\nhas trebled since its inception, the size of the\r\nSecurity Council cannot remain constant any\r\nlonger. Wider representation in the Security\r\nCouncil is a must, if it is to ensure its moral\r\nsanction and particular effectiveness.”\r\n(S/PV.3046, p. 97)\r\nThe leader of the delegation of India to the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly spelled out\r\nour views on these subjects succinctly in his address to the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 3 October 1994. In our view, it is\r\nimperative to expand the membership in permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories. Non-aligned and other\r\ndeveloping countries must be included in the permanent\r\nmember category to give them an opportunity to make their\r\ncontribution to the working of the Council on a\r\ncontinuing basis. The number of non-permanent seats\r\nmust also be increased to give Member States greater\r\nopportunity for participation in the work of the Council.\r\nAs the eventual size of the Council will depend on\r\nagreement on the number of members to be added to each\r\ncategory, we remain flexible on this issue. We note,\r\nhowever, that in the Working Group there was near\r\nconsensus on a figure in the middle twenties.\r\nWe often come across proposals that one country or\r\nanother should be added to the permanent member\r\ncategory without going through a systematic process of\r\nselection on the basis of relevant criteria. We would\r\nadvise against a selective, piecemeal expansion of the\r\npermanent member category. The laws of the corporate\r\nworld, where equity shares determine voting power,\r\nshould not apply to the Security Council, nor should we\r\nemulate the Bretton Woods institutions in which wealth\r\ndetermines the strength of the votes. Here at the United\r\nNations, we believe in the principle of sovereign equality\r\nof nations. To maintain international peace and security,\r\nthe Security Council should be representative of the\r\ninternational community as a whole, and its agenda\r\nshould not vary from that of the general membership.\r\nDemocracy and good governance are as good for the\r\nUnited Nations as for its Member States. The only\r\nprudent method we can follow, therefore, is to elaborate\r\nthe set of criteria against which the claims of Member\r\nStates for permanent membership should be judged.\r\nIn our view, these criteria should include population,\r\nsize of economy, contribution to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and to peace-keeping and\r\nfuture potential. There may be others, but selection of a\r\ncountry should follow rather than precede the\r\nestablishment of the criteria. The non-aligned Foreign\r\nMinisters representing the largest grouping of Member\r\nStates at the United Nations agreed on this point when\r\nthey recently declared any predetermined selection\r\nexcluding the non-aligned and other developing countries\r\nunacceptable to the Movement. As stated by the leader of\r\nthe Indian delegation, we are confident that India deserves\r\nto be a permanent member of the Security Council judged\r\nagainst any set of criteria. We stand ready to serve in that\r\ncapacity whenever we are called upon to do so.\r\nThe general debate in the plenary this year has\r\nturned up a number of imaginative and innovative\r\nproposals for the expansion and reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We shall study them and give them our full\r\nconsideration as they come up for discussion in the Open-\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nended Working Group. But our basic approach is that the\r\nexpansion should take place in the existing categories and\r\non the basis of present geographical groupings. A radical\r\nreorganization of the Council, with new categories of\r\nmembers, or new geographical arrangements, will lead to\r\nmore complications and retard the progress we have\r\nachieved so far. Such proposals may even require a\r\ncomprehensive review of the Charter itself. The time has\r\ncome for us to work out an expansion package within the\r\nframework that the Charter provides. Durability, resilience\r\nand expedience, rather than expediency, should determine\r\nthe time frame for such an expansion.\r\nMy delegation would equally stress that the reform\r\npackage we are considering should devote equal attention\r\nto expansion as to the improvement of the Council’s\r\nworking methods to enhance transparency. In addition to an\r\nintegral and substantial reporting by the Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, a regular system of exchange between\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council through an\r\nappropriate mechanism is essential for reassuring the\r\ngeneral membership of the accountability of the Council to\r\nthe Assembly. The Council should also act in strict\r\nconformity with the provisions of the Charter and limit\r\nitself to the maintenance of international peace and security\r\nand not clutter its agenda with extraneous issues.\r\nWe greatly look forward to the commencement of\r\ndiscussions on the scope and nature of expansion of the\r\nCouncil, as well as on the measures necessary to improve\r\nits functioning, early in the year.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil): The deliberations by the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council during the forty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly have constituted an important initial step\r\nin the complex process of reforming the Security Council.\r\nWe are grateful to Mr. Samuel Insanally, who chaired\r\nthat body, as well as to the Vice-Chairmen, Mr. Wilhelm\r\nBreitenstein and Mr. Chew Tai Soo, whose skilful steering\r\nallowed the Working Group to conduct its challenging task\r\nin a constructive way.\r\nThe report in document A/48/47 appears spartan in its\r\ncontent, but may prove eloquent in its understatement. In\r\nfact, in just nine paragraphs it encapsulates the proceedings\r\nof 22 intensely debated meetings and in one single\r\nparagraph, the eighth, it reflects the essence of the results\r\nof the exercise thus far. The core of that paragraph states\r\nthat\r\n“While there was a convergence of views that\r\nthe membership of the Security Council should be\r\nenlarged, there was also agreement that the scope\r\nand nature of such enlargement require further\r\ndiscussion.” (A/48/47, para. 8)\r\nThe concision of that statement is compensated for\r\nby the depth of its significance. Here, for the first time,\r\nit is pointed out unequivocally that the membership of the\r\nOrganization as a whole recognizes that the Security\r\nCouncil should be enlarged. It is no longer a matter of\r\n“whether or not”, but rather of “how large and how\r\nsoon”.\r\nMoreover, by agreeing to discuss further the scope\r\nand nature of such an enlargement, the Working Group\r\nhas recognized that the objectives of the exercise concern\r\nnot just the quantitative increase, but also the qualitative\r\ncomposition of that important organ.\r\nTherefore, in its first year of deliberations, the\r\nWorking Group succeeded in identifying and defining the\r\nmain parameters of the question: first that the Security\r\nCouncil should be enlarged; and, secondly, that the\r\nenlargement should contemplate not only quantitative but\r\nalso qualitative elements.\r\nAs recommended in the report of the Working\r\nGroup, Brazil believes that the discussion of agenda item\r\n33 should continue during this forty-ninth session,\r\nbuilding on the work done at the forty-eighth session and\r\non the views expressed at the current session. In response\r\nto this call, my delegation would like to present today\r\nsome further views on this important issue as a\r\ncontribution to further deliberations in the Working\r\nGroup.\r\nI will not dwell on the question of the need for the\r\nenlargement of the Council, since this is already a\r\nconsensual view. What we must address in depth now are\r\nthe subsequent twin questions of the scope and nature of\r\nthe enlargement. From the deliberations of the Working\r\nGroup there seems to emerge a general perception that the\r\nfinal determination of the size and composition of a\r\nrestructured Security Council has to be predicated on\r\nthree basic qualifications: equitable representation,\r\neffectiveness and efficiency.\r\nEquitable representation stems from the idea that the\r\nmembership of the Security Council should be adequately\r\nincreased in order to make it more representative of the\r\nmembership at large in view of present-day realities in\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\ninternational life. It is our belief that better representation\r\nwill lead to a more democratic, as well as a more effective\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nA balanced quantitative as well as qualitative\r\nexpansion of the Council’s composition should contemplate\r\nthe following aspects. First, appropriate proportionality\r\nbetween the size of the Council and that of the entire\r\nmembership of the Organization; secondly, concomitant\r\nincrease of permanent as well as non-permanent seats in the\r\nCouncil; thirdly, adequate participation of both\r\nindustrialized and developing countries in a future\r\nexpansion of permanent members; fourthly, adequate\r\npresence of the international community in all its\r\nexpressions, regional and otherwise; fifthly, due regard\r\nshould be specially paid to the capability of members to\r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity and to the other purposes of the Organization;\r\nsixthly, appropriate arrangements should be made in order\r\nto allow better participation of medium-sized and small\r\nMember States in the Council.\r\nEffectiveness and efficiency are two other critical\r\nqualifications required in the restructuring of the Council in\r\norder to improve its role in the discharge of its functions\r\nand powers.\r\nEfficiency derives from the process of the Council\r\ntaking action promptly, and its effectiveness relates to the\r\nCouncil’s taking action that yields the intended results.\r\nTherefore, due attention should be paid in order not to\r\nconfuse or equate efficiency and effectiveness. A Security\r\nCouncil that expeditiously adopts dozens or more\r\nstatements and resolutions in succession, the\r\nimplementation of which remains largely ignored or\r\nunfulfilled, may be seen to be efficient, but would not be\r\neffective. Conversely, a single decision taken by the\r\nCouncil after lengthy and thorough deliberations with the\r\nparticipation of all the relevant parties could be very\r\neffective, while not necessarily qualifying as “prompt”\r\naction.\r\nAnother confusion that should be avoided is to\r\nautomatically correlate the size of the Council with its\r\nefficiency. Even the most ideally efficient Council\r\ncomposed of one single member could be ineffective if that\r\nmember lacked political will and adequate resources. In the\r\nsame way, a Council composed of 10, 15, 20 or 30\r\nmembers could, regardless of its size, be paralysed\r\nindefinitely by a single veto or threat of veto.\r\nA larger Council could be made more effective if\r\nmore members with appropriate political, diplomatic,\r\nfinancial, military, cultural or other relevant resources are\r\ncalled in to cooperate in the task of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. Equally, a larger Council\r\ncould become more effective when it is perceived by the\r\ninternational community as being more equitably\r\ncomposed, and therefore more authoritative in its\r\ndeliberations and decisions.\r\nAs I mentioned before, the efficiency of the Council\r\nis related to its process of decision-making, while its\r\neffectiveness is related to the achievement of the desired\r\nresults in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. It is the considered view of my delegation that\r\nthe increase in the efficiency of the Security is\r\nfundamentally linked to the perfecting of its working\r\nmethods, whereas the effectiveness of the Council would\r\nsubstantially improve through a balanced, quantitative and\r\nqualitative expansion of its composition, which would\r\nendow it with more authority and more resources.\r\nThe relationship of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, to other bodies and organizations and\r\nto non-members of the Security Council, on the one hand,\r\nand the reform by the Security Council of its working\r\nmethods and procedures on the other constitute two topics\r\nthat are fundamentally interlinked with the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council. All of these are\r\ncrucial aspects of our endeavours aimed at enhancing the\r\nlegitimacy and the effectiveness of that main organ.\r\nI should like to underscore the organic relationship\r\nbetween the Security Council as a whole and the\r\nmembership at large of the United Nations, pursuant to\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter, in order to address the question\r\nof the accountability and transparency of the actions of\r\nthe Security Council vis-à-vis the Members of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nIts accountability stems from the fact that, in acting\r\non behalf of the Members of the United Nations, the\r\nSecurity Council must effectively respond to the\r\nexpectations of the international community. Each\r\nmember of the Council, permanent and non-permanent\r\nalike, is therefore accountable to the membership at large\r\nof the Organization for its contribution to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nLikewise, transparency derives from the need for\r\nnon-members of the Council to be able to follow and\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nparticipate in, as appropriate, the discussion of any question\r\nof concern to them, as provided for in Articles 31 and 32\r\nof the Charter. Accountability and transparency would thus\r\ncontribute to enhancing the legitimacy and the effectiveness\r\nof a more equitably represented Security Council. In this\r\nregard, the delegation of Brazil has advocated some\r\npractical measures for improving the accountability and\r\ntransparency of the Security Council.\r\nAs a small contribution in this regard, the delegation\r\nof Brazil took the initiative, during its presidency of the\r\nSecurity Council in October 1993, of introducing the report\r\nof that organ to the General Assembly. It is our expectation\r\nthat this practice will be maintained and further improved\r\nin the future, with a view to establishing a more wide-\r\nranging dialogue between these two main organs of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe reporting system of the Security Council should\r\nbe improved, both in form and in content, with a view to\r\nmaking the paperwork and the procedures of the Council\r\nless opaque and more user-friendly.\r\nWhile concurring with the pertinent criticism that the\r\nreports of the Security Council make for arid reading and\r\ncould be more analytical, we note that the document in its\r\ncurrent format reports only on the official proceedings. The\r\ncrux of the problem is that the contents of the informal\r\nconsultations, by their very nature, are not recorded and\r\nthus cannot be formally reported. In this regard,\r\nmechanisms could be devised to preserve in some\r\nauthoritative way the main contents of the informal\r\nconsultations and to keep the interested public informed.\r\nWe deem it useful for the President of the Council to\r\nbrief regularly the Chairmen of regional groups on the\r\nprogramme of work of the month. We also deem it helpful\r\nfor the President to attend, whenever appropriate, meetings\r\nof the regional groups to brief them on matters of specific\r\ninterest to them. Moreover, we believe that such practice\r\ncould be further improved by another modality of briefing\r\nby the President at the end of his or her term, giving an\r\nassessment of the work accomplished by the Council during\r\nthat President’s tenure. Such briefings could be given to the\r\nmembership at large in the form of a public informal\r\nmeeting at the end of the month.\r\nSimilarly, we deem it appropriate that at the end of\r\neach informal consultation, the President of the Council, or\r\na member of his or her delegation, give a succinct briefing\r\nof the deliberations to interested delegations. Alternatively,\r\nsuch a task could be performed by a spokesperson from\r\nthe Secretariat, specifically designated for that purpose.\r\nLikewise, as regards the participation of non-\r\nmembers in the discussions of the Council, we believe\r\nthat there is room for improvement somewhere in\r\nbetween the exclusionary nature of informal consultations\r\nand the rigid formality of the public meetings. To this\r\nend, I should like to make the following suggestions.\r\nFirst, there could be more frequent recourse to\r\nArticle 29 of the Charter, establishing ad hoc subsidiary\r\norgans that could assist the Council by performing a\r\nmonitoring or a mediation role for the peaceful settlement\r\nof specific disputes with the participation, as appropriate,\r\nof interested non-members. Such a mechanism would\r\ngreatly contribute to re-establishing the pre-eminence of\r\nthe diplomatic functions of the Council, which we regard\r\nas a priority task at this moment.\r\nSecondly, a special committee of the Security\r\nCouncil could be established, as was suggested once by\r\nthe delegation of New Zealand, with the function of\r\nproviding political oversight of the peace-keeping\r\noperations and serving as a forum for consultation with\r\ntroop-contributing Members not represented in the\r\nCouncil, as well as for liaison with, and briefings from,\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretariat.\r\nThirdly, there could be more frequent recourse to the\r\nhighly informal meetings in the so-called ”“Diego Arria”\r\nformat, in order to allow Council members to receive\r\nbriefings and input on matters before the Council from\r\nthe different parties to conflicts or from representatives of\r\nrelevant regional organizations, as appropriate.\r\nFourthly, along the same lines, the sanctions\r\ncommittees could consider ways to better enable\r\ninvoluntarily affected Member States to bring to the\r\nattention of Council members the problems they face in\r\nimplementing the sanctions adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nAnd, fifthly, the Security Council could also\r\nintensify its efforts to develop new channels and practices\r\nfor an improved assessment of problems that arise from\r\nthe implementation of sanctions regimes, with a view to\r\ngiving a more concrete expression to the consultations\r\nunder Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nMany of these suggestions could be enshrined in a\r\ndefinitive version of the provisional rules of procedure of\r\nthe Security Council. Elements that could be the object of\r\nsuch a review and update might include, inter alia, clear\r\nprovisions concerning the holding of formal meetings as\r\nwell as informal consultations; provisions concerning the\r\nparticipation of non-members of the Council in informal\r\nconsultations; more detailed provisions concerning\r\nsubsidiary bodies such as commissions, committees or\r\nrapporteurs for specific questions; improved provisions\r\nconcerning the publicity of meetings, circulation of\r\ndocuments and keeping of records, as appropriate; and\r\nprovisions related to the use of the veto.\r\nIt is our belief that the final consensual result of the\r\nimportant process of ensuring equitable representation on\r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council\r\nmust reflect an adequate combination of all the elements I\r\nmentioned earlier that would be perceived as fair and\r\nequitable by the membership at large. Such a result would\r\nbe fundamental for ensuring that the future Security\r\nCouncil we envisage will be efficient and effective as well\r\nas legitimate and authoritative, and, last but not least,\r\nrepresentative.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
