(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 33 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters\r\nMr. Londoño (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Mr. President, allow me to congratulate you on\r\nyour election to the Presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nthis session. We are assured that with your experience and\r\nskill you will guide our work with great success.\r\nI should also like to congratulate Ambassador\r\nSamuel Insanally of Guyana for his excellent performance\r\nas President of the forty-eighth session. As President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Ambassador Insanally conducted the\r\ndebate in the Open-Ended Working Group of the Assembly\r\non the Question of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council.\r\nColombia joined in the adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of the report of the Working Group (A/48/47) by\r\nconsensus on 14 September 1994. We believe it is\r\nappropriate to continue the debate in the same manner next\r\nyear. Although some views were expressed on this item,\r\nwe believe that there is still a long way to go. Colombia’s\r\nposition is well known. First and foremost, we believe that\r\ntransparency and confidence are essential in this important\r\neffort to present to the international community and our\r\nown peoples the kind of reform that will truly reflect the\r\ndemocratization of the international system through the\r\nelimination of privileges which were created 50 years\r\nago.\r\nThe credibility, representativeness and legitimacy of\r\nthe decisions of the Council hinge on its methods of work\r\nand the effective participation and confidence which\r\nMember States place in the Council. A Security Council\r\nwhich is isolated from the majority of Members of the\r\nUnited Nations will not contribute to the revitalization of\r\nthe Organization and the effective management of the\r\ncrises it has to deal with. We believe that a thorough,\r\ncomprehensive reform should be undertaken and not\r\nsimply an exercise to accommodate the interests of a few\r\npre-selected States and an increase in the privileges of\r\nothers.\r\nWhile the nature of the inclusion of the developing\r\nworld in the international system allowed the creation of\r\nexceptional rights for some States, the time has come to\r\nchange this once and for all. We have the responsibility\r\nto ensure that the United Nations shall achieve the\r\nobjectives for which it was created - to promote\r\ndevelopment and the well-being of all nations in an\r\nenvironment of equality and justice. We cannot continue\r\nfrom the very heart of this Organization to breach the\r\ngoverning principle of international relations, namely, the\r\nprinciple of the legal equality of States.\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nIn our opinion, there should be a freeze on the\r\ncategory of permanent members and it should gradually be\r\neliminated. Those seats are the result of negotiations\r\nconducted in the past which have no validity in our times.\r\nLikewise, the veto should be restricted and eventually\r\neliminated. Clearly, the idea of its extension to more\r\nmembers of the Security Council should be discarded.\r\nWe believe that the best way to adjust the Council to\r\nthe new realities is through an increase in the number of its\r\nnon-permanent members. Similarly, we could agree to\r\nre-election of some seats according to the decisions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on a case-by-case basis. Thus the whole\r\nmembership would endorse those States that had gained the\r\nconfidence and support of the international community.\r\nClearly, the main criteria would continue to be equitable\r\ngeographical representation and the equality of States.\r\nWhile we understand the need for some degree of\r\ndiscretion in the work of the Security Council, it is\r\nunacceptable to have all major issues discussed behind\r\nclosed doors as is the case at present. This weakens the\r\nconfidence among the Members of the Organization, takes\r\naway from the credibility of the decisions of the Security\r\nCouncil and limits their acceptance by Member States. The\r\nCouncil should discuss its items in open debates.\r\nTransparency does not limit the effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThere should be formal briefings by the Security\r\nCouncil for the benefit of Member States. In addition,\r\nthere are other mechanisms stipulated in the Charter that\r\ncould promote ongoing communication between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly.\r\nA subsidiary organ of the General Assembly created\r\nin accordance with Article 22 of the Charter could\r\ncontribute to the formulation of Security Council decisions\r\nand receive information before decisions are adopted. Such\r\na subsidiary organ could likewise enlarge the application of\r\ncertain Articles of the Charter, such as Article 11.\r\nThe chairman of such a subsidiary body, who could be\r\nthe President of the General Assembly or one of the\r\nAssembly’s Vice-Presidents, could be invited to participate\r\nin the formal and informal meetings of the Security\r\nCouncil. Thus the President or Vice-President would\r\nensure channels of communication and also ensure that the\r\nrecommendations of the Member States are appropriately\r\nreflected in the Council’s decisions.\r\nThe dynamic of the Working Group has shown that\r\nsimplistic solutions should be discarded, that the\r\nexpansion of privileges for a minority is not acceptable,\r\nand that the new system which may stem from this\r\nexercise should recognize the fact that democratization in\r\ninternational relations is a reality which should be\r\nappropriately reflected in the United Nations over the next\r\n50 years.\r\nMr. Flores Olea (Mexico) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The General Assembly has before it today\r\ndocument A/48/47, which contains the report of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, established under resolution 48/26\r\nadopted last year in this very Hall.\r\nMy delegation wishes to thank for his hard work the\r\nChairman of the Open-ended Working Group, your\r\npredecessor, Sir, in the post of President of the General\r\nAssembly, Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, and\r\nalso the Vice-Chairmen, the Permanent Representatives of\r\nFinland, Ambassador Wilhelm Breitenstein, and of\r\nSingapore, Ambassador Chew Tai Soo. Thanks to their\r\nefforts, progress has been made in this difficult exercise.\r\nThroughout the year there was a productive\r\nexchange of views, which made it possible to pinpoint the\r\nmajor problems that we face in the sensitive task of\r\nadapting the Security Council to the new era, so different\r\nfrom that in which the Council was created.\r\nIn accordance with the approach taken by resolution\r\n48/26, the Open-ended Working Group should pay equal\r\nattention to increasing the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and to other matters, particularly the Council’s\r\nworking methods and its relationship with the General\r\nAssembly. This is not a mere numerical exercise; rather,\r\nit concerns the principal organ responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security in the\r\nface of the challenges of a world very different from the\r\none in which it came into being.\r\nMy delegation has supported the need for a thorough\r\nreform of the Council, and we repeat our conviction that\r\nsuch reform cannot be confined to satisfying the\r\naspirations of the new economic Powers. That would\r\nmean failing the international community, and we would\r\njustify the greatest criticism of the United Nations - that\r\nit often looks after the interests of the great Powers. It\r\nwould also mean weakening the universality of the United\r\nNations and fostering a lack of confidence in it; the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nresulting disillusionment and criticism would be all too\r\nunderstandable.\r\nThe international community deserves to have a\r\nlegitimate and effective Security Council. These two\r\nconditions demand a truly representative organ, reflecting\r\nthe current situation, and working diligently and vigorously.\r\nIn this framework, some hold the view that the\r\nnumber of members of the Council determines its ability to\r\nact and that therefore any increase would have negative\r\neffects. We do not believe that that is the correct approach.\r\nA majority of countries claims that, within manageable\r\nlimits, Security Council membership should be increased in\r\norder to make the Council more representative of the regions -\r\nAsia, Africa and Latin America - which traditionally have\r\nbeen particularly underrepresented.\r\nIt is often forgotten that, under the Charter, the\r\nSecurity Council has no authority of its own. Strictly\r\nspeaking, the other 169 Member States have delegated to\r\nthe Council specific responsibilities and authority with\r\nregard to peace and security. For this very reason its\r\ncomposition must reflect the growing membership of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nLet us also recall the Council’s responsibilities towards\r\nthe General Assembly; we are the organ that conferred on\r\nthe Council responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The first Charter\r\nmechanism to link the two organs is the annual report that\r\nthe Council has to submit to the Assembly in order to keep\r\nMember States duly informed on the way in which the\r\nCouncil is discharging its functions.\r\nUnfortunately, in practice this substantive obligation\r\nhas been transformed into nothing more than a belated\r\nformality, with little content. Last year we were fortunate\r\nenough to have a timely report and, for the first time in\r\nalmost 50 years, it was presented personally by the\r\nCouncil’s President - Ambassador Ronaldo Mota\r\nSardenberg of Brazil that month - whom we again thank.\r\nWe thought that an excellent precedent had been set.\r\nRegrettably, that does not seem to be the case. This year\r\nwe are again experiencing the delay to which we have\r\nbecome accustomed.\r\nFurthermore, despite our insistence, the Council’s\r\nreport has been treated as a mere matter of procedure, when\r\nthe mandate given in the Charter relates to a substantive,\r\nreasoned and amply explanatory document. A substantive\r\nreport of the kind we are proposing should include,\r\namong other elements, the matters being considered by\r\nthe Council, the specific conditions under which they\r\nwere brought before it, the considerations that were taken\r\ninto account when adopting decisions and the results\r\nachieved.\r\nOne of the objectives of the Working Group is to\r\nintroduce greater transparency and democracy, and\r\ntherefore greater effectiveness and legitimacy into the\r\nwork of the Security Council, which was never conceived\r\nas the closed preserve of only a few States. Several\r\nproposals have been made.\r\nMy delegation repeats that we believe there must be\r\na summary report of informal consultations; a rapporteur\r\nmight be the right mechanism. In any case, wider\r\npublicity should be given to the consultations between the\r\nPresident of the Security Council and the various regional\r\ngroups. Another improvement would be the establishment\r\nof a system whereby members of the Council reported to\r\ntheir respective groups on matters under consideration by\r\nthe Council. Greater communication between the Security\r\nCouncil and States affected by its decisions is urgently\r\nrequired.\r\nThese procedural reforms do not require amendments\r\nto the Charter. They could be incorporated gradually into\r\nthe practice of the Council or else into the final rules of\r\nprocedure that its Members would eventually have to\r\nadopt.\r\nRegarding the necessary increase in the membership\r\nof the Security Council, Mexico believes that there is no\r\njustification for the inclusion of new permanent members.\r\nThe specific weight of certain countries in the\r\ninternational community cannot be disregarded, but this\r\nin itself does not warrant granting them exceptional\r\nprivileges, such as the right to be members of the\r\nSecurity Council for an indeterminate period with\r\nextraordinary and disputable prerogatives, especially in a\r\nconstantly changing world that aspires to true legal\r\nequality among States.\r\nWe acknowledge the wishes expressed by certain\r\ncountries, and after careful consideration Mexico is\r\ninclined to go along with the idea of an expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Security Council comprising new,\r\nnon-permanent members and, in due course, others with\r\nan extended mandate or with the possibility of more\r\nfrequent rotation. The selection of those non-permanent\r\nmembers or of those serving on a rotation basis or with\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nan enlarged mandate would first and foremost be decided\r\nupon by each regional group.\r\nThe decision-making process in the Council is subject\r\nto the assent of its five permanent members. We know that\r\nthis privilege, granted in San Francisco to the victors of the\r\nSecond World War, paralysed the Council in the days of\r\nthe cold war, and for almost five decades prevented it from\r\nacting effectively. But we are now living in different\r\ntimes. In the last four years, we have seen a reduction in\r\nthe exercise of the veto. This new situation is encouraging\r\nand it is precisely for this reason that we can ask ourselves\r\nif the time has not come to correct some of the political\r\nnecessities of 1945 and their distortions.\r\nThere was a flagrant contradiction in the Charter from\r\nthe very outset: despite the fact that the United Nations\r\nwas to be founded on democratic principles, the political\r\nreality of those times made it necessary to grant a certain\r\nprivileged, and in a way irregular status, to five of its\r\nmembers. It was said that the veto would oblige those\r\nPowers to take a unified stand and thus reach clear-cut\r\nagreements. However, it soon became apparent that the\r\nveto not only did not ensure such unity of views but that it\r\nin fact made it possible for the Powers to maintain their\r\ndifferences and defend their own interests without making\r\nany real efforts to have their views converge.\r\nMexico has always opposed the veto because it runs\r\ncounter to the principles of democracy and the equality of\r\nStates before the law. Moreover, rather than making it less\r\ndifficult to reach agreements among the nations it fosters\r\ndifferences and confrontation. But the exceptional\r\ncircumstances that gave rise to the veto at the end of the\r\nSecond World War have now, fortunately, been overcome.\r\nMy delegation maintains that it is not possible to revive\r\nartificially the conditions of the past, or to repeat the errors\r\nimposed by a political situation that no longer exists, by\r\ngranting the veto to possible new members of the Council.\r\nTo accept this would be to contradict once more the very\r\nfoundations of the Organization. Nor is this all: it would\r\nonce again present the States and the international public at\r\nlarge with the spectacle of the United Nations as an organ\r\nmore interested in protecting the interests of a few Powers\r\nthan in attending to the urgent needs of the international\r\ncommunity, particularly when economic capabilities are\r\ninvoked as the main reason for being elected. Neither the\r\nUnited Nations nor the Security Council can be compared\r\nto the board of directors of a business. Nothing would be\r\nmore degrading for the prestige and image of the United\r\nNations than artificially to revive non-democratic\r\narrangements to accommodate the wishes of only a few\r\ncountries.\r\nWe repeat that it would be desirable to eliminate the\r\nveto, while recognizing the difficulty of this idea, because\r\nit seems unimaginable in realpolitik that any of the five\r\npermanent members would be sufficiently disinterested -\r\nand the clear-sighted - to recognize the political\r\nrequirements of today and to give up that right. Such\r\nfantasy can only feed our illusions but can go no further.\r\nNone the less, we should not unnecessarily repeat the\r\nerrors of the past.\r\nWe should aspire to regulate the use of the veto by\r\nthe current five permanent members, whose number - I\r\nrepeat - should not be increased for any reason. In this\r\nconnection, we were encouraged by the proposal made\r\nbefore this Assembly a few days ago by the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of Australia, Mr. Gareth Evans, namely\r\nthat we gradually dilute the veto by requiring that, in\r\norder for it to be valid, at least two of the permanent\r\nmembers would have to agree to block the decision of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nAt the San Francisco Conference, in 1945, Australia\r\nalso proposed that the veto not apply in cases involving\r\nthe exercise of the Council’s mandate under Chapter VI.\r\nThis would be in keeping with the spirit of the Charter,\r\ngranting the five permanent members the exclusive\r\nresponsibility of adopting sanctions under Chapter VII\r\nwithout the possibility of paralysing the Council’s efforts\r\nto find a peaceful, negotiated solution in accordance with\r\nChapter VI. We believe the time has come to reconsider\r\nthis proposal with a broad, long-term political vision that\r\ngoes beyond vested interests.\r\nThe decisions of the Working Group will be\r\nreflected in reforms of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe procedure for bringing about such reforms is\r\ncomplex, since it requires approval by two-thirds of its\r\nmembership, including the five permanent members. That\r\nis to say, it cannot be imposed.\r\nAmending the Charter is a two-way street. Without\r\nthe support of the permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil, no amendment can enter into force. But the\r\npermanent members cannot forget that any amendments\r\nthey may propose must also have the support of two-\r\nthirds of the members of the General Assembly. In other\r\nwords, to reform the Charter, it is necessary to consider\r\nthe general interest and not impose pressures or unilateral\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\ndemands in order to bend the will of States with greater\r\nneeds.\r\nMexico supports the decision contained in the report\r\nthat the Working Group should continue its work. We\r\nmust redouble our efforts to make positive strides. With\r\ngood faith and good will we could arrive relatively easily\r\nat conclusions that are shared by all and that would lead to\r\na principle of consensus. But we also understand that in\r\nthis task we cannot be simplistic. Nor can we just parade\r\ndecisions, losing sight of the final objective: a substantive\r\nreform that will take account of the interests of all and\r\navoid hasty arrangements that satisfy the interests of only\r\na few.\r\nWe should not establish any fixed dates or deadlines\r\nfor the completion of this task. It is now time to negotiate,\r\nit is true, but without undue haste. Such amendments well\r\ndeserve our thorough consideration.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria)(interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me first to extend my thanks and congratulations to\r\nPresident Samuel Insanally and the Ambassadors of\r\nSingapore and Finland for their wise and effective guidance\r\nof the Working Group whose report is now before the\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe holding at this point in time of a public debate on\r\nthe question of equitable representation, increased\r\nmembership and other issues relating to the workings of the\r\nSecurity Council is both timely and important as it affords\r\nus all an opportunity to put forward our views and\r\nproposals and, at the same time, to try and crystallize the\r\ndiscussions that took place in the General Assembly’s\r\nWorking Group in the light of the ideas put forward at the\r\nforty-eighth session and those propounded by Member\r\nStates in their interventions in the general debate at this\r\npresent session of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation’s concern that there should be meetings\r\ndevoted to a discussion of this question stems from our\r\nconviction that the procedural decision adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly at the end of the forty-eighth session to\r\ncontinue discussion of the agenda item within the Working\r\nGroup during the forty-ninth session should have been\r\nsupported by a political frame of reference and political\r\nguidelines that could be gleaned by the Assembly from the\r\nwide-ranging and fecund discussions that took place,\r\nparticularly, within the Working Group, and which gave\r\nbirth to some very interesting ideas.\r\nIt is in that context that my delegation proposed an\r\namendment to operative paragraph 2 of the decision\r\nrequesting the Working Group to take duly into account\r\nthe views expressed at the forty-ninth session, both during\r\nthe general debate and during discussions on agenda item\r\n33 of the session’s agenda.\r\nThis flows also from our conviction that the modest\r\nprogress achieved so far towards identifying the problems,\r\nconcepts and the methodology to be adopted in dealing\r\nwith all the issues involved in reforming this major and\r\nsensitive organ whose role impacts on international peace\r\nand security and is so vital in international affairs, was\r\nmade possible thanks to our far-reaching frank\r\ndiscussions. The ideal formula for restructuring the\r\nCouncil must be based therefore on an international\r\nconsensus derived from a wide-ranging, democratic and\r\ntransparent debate in which care should be taken not to\r\nmarginalize the developing countries which did not\r\nparticipate either in founding the Organization or in\r\ndrafting its Charter.\r\nThe importance attached by Algeria to the question\r\nof reforming the Security Council with them of ensuring\r\nequitable representation on the Council as well as the\r\neffectiveness, transparency and democratization of that\r\nbody’s deliberations and decision-making procedures, was\r\ndemonstrated by the pioneering initiative of Algeria,\r\ntogether with nine other Member States, to inscribe on the\r\nagenda of the thirty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly in 1979 an item entitled, \"Question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council.\" Since then, Algeria has continued to\r\ncontribute effectively to placing this vast,\r\nmultidimensional endeavour in the context of the overall\r\nframework of reforming the United Nations system as a\r\nwhole, and of the Security Council in particular, in a\r\nmanner that would be compatible with the new realities\r\nof the world situation.\r\nWith regard more specifically to the Security\r\nCouncil, Algeria submitted a detailed written account of\r\nits ideas and approach during the discussions held in the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s Open-Ended Working Group on\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and other questions\r\nrelating to the Council’s workings.\r\nThus, from the methodological point of view, my\r\ndelegation opted for a comprehensive approach and\r\nexpounded its ideas on the basis of two postulates. The\r\nfirst concerned the inequitable nature of the Council’s\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\npresent composition and its geographical and cultural\r\nimbalance. In addition, there is the fact that, given the\r\nlarge increase in membership in recent years, from a purely\r\nnumerical point of view, the Council does not reflect the\r\nOrganization’s present-day composition. The second\r\npostulate concerns the climate created by the end of the\r\ncold war, which has given the international community the\r\nhope that it could look forward to the emergence of a new\r\nworld governed by law, an order based on democracy and\r\nparticipation that would opt for consensus in decision-\r\nmaking and that would ensure that this should be reflected\r\nin the Council’s functioning and procedural working\r\nmethods.\r\nAccordingly, with regard to the issue of increased\r\nmembership of the Council, we have focused on the criteria\r\nof equitable representation and the logical implication of the\r\nneed to give priority to seeing that any increase of whatever\r\nkind in the number of members should help redress the\r\npresent imbalance. We have also emphasized the need to\r\nabide by the criteria enshrined in the Charter and by the\r\nrequirement that regional organizations, such as the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the League of Arab\r\nStates, be considered in any attempt to adjust the regional\r\nbalance and the need to enshrine the principle of rotation in\r\ndischarging the Council’s responsibilities, in keeping with\r\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of States, just as it\r\nis also necessary to take into account the readiness of\r\nMember States to shoulder their responsibilities in the\r\nachievement and maintenance of collective security.\r\nIn this same context, we have frankly and clearly\r\ndrawn attention to the need to regulate and limit the areas\r\nand subjects which may continue to be subject to the veto.\r\nWe have voiced our principled conviction that the granting\r\nof veto power to other Member States would not be\r\nconducive to democratization of the Council or make it\r\nmore effective. To the contrary, such a step would be\r\nlikely to worsen the imbalances that exist between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries and give rise to\r\ncompetition and prejudicial contradictions that could affect\r\nthe political climate prevailing in the world and within\r\nregional groupings.\r\nDuring the discussions in the Working Group, several\r\ndelegations were unanimous that reform of the Council’s\r\nworking methods and procedures, involves certain political\r\naspects that cannot be ignored and that, consequently, it\r\nwould not be reasonable to oppose an equitable increase in\r\nthe Council’s membership under the pretext that the\r\naddition of a number of seats would jeopardize the\r\nCouncil’s efficiency.\r\nIt also became clear that equitable representation on\r\nthe Council is essential to the strengthening of its political\r\nand moral authority and would ensure for its resolutions\r\nthe respect and voluntary implementation that are\r\nnecessary for its efficacy. It was emphasized also that\r\nthere is a need to address the economic and social causes\r\nthat lie behind many disputes in the world. It is in this\r\ncontext that we should be aware of the importance of the\r\nCouncil’s relationship with its environment and its natural\r\npartners - the non-members of the Council, on whose\r\nbehalf it acts - as well as with the other main bodies of\r\nthe Organization, especially the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, and regional organizations\r\nand arrangements, which, pursuant to the Charter, have an\r\nimportant role to play in the prevention and peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes. Some very useful ideas were put\r\nforward in this context with the aim of promoting greater\r\ninteraction between the Council and its partners on the\r\nbasis of transparency, cooperation and concerted action.\r\nMy delegation has reached the conclusion that it is\r\nessential for realism to be combined with ambition in\r\naddressing this question, in both its political and its legal\r\naspects, if we are to effect a qualitative reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, that would establish new working\r\nmethods and safeguard the Council against the blocking\r\nof its functioning and against its being monopolized in the\r\nservice of narrow national interests that would be\r\ndetrimental to its effectiveness and its credibility.\r\nAccordingly, we have called for an honest reading\r\nof Article 24 of the Charter as this would highlight the\r\nneed to take effective account of the contractual\r\nrelationship enshrined in this fundamental text, pursuant\r\nto which the parties that confer the Council’s mandate -\r\nall the Member States - have the legal right to exercise\r\npolitical and legal control over the Council’s actions and\r\nresolutions. In this context, my delegation has stressed\r\nthat it is high time the International Court of Justice, on\r\nthe initiative of the General Assembly, was given the\r\ncompetence to determine the constitutionality of\r\nresolutions adopted by the Security Council.\r\nWith regard to the procedural aspect of\r\nimplementing arrangements or possible amendments to\r\nthe Charter, my delegation once again calls for the\r\nconvening of a general review conference - something for\r\nwhich the Charter makes provision - to enable all\r\nMember States, particularly the new ones, to participate\r\nin a rebirth of the Organization.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nOur discussions have revealed the sensitive nature and\r\ncomplexity of this question. Finding a formula that would\r\nbe satisfactory to all may appear to be an extremely\r\ndifficult undertaking. However, this difficulty should not\r\nbe used as a pretext to opt out of the necessary transparent\r\nand democratic debate in order to replace it by bargainings\r\nthat serve nothing but narrow individual ambitions. The\r\ndifficult nature of the task should not dissuade us from\r\ncontinuing our efforts and collective discussions toward the\r\ndesired consensus on a restructuring formula that would\r\nguarantee equitable representation, and ensure the\r\neffectiveness and credibility of the Security Council.\r\nClearly, the world is now in a position to take\r\nadvantage of a political climate that favours the introduction\r\nof meaningful reform of a Security Council, whose\r\nstructures and philosophy were the products of a particular\r\nhistorical context and of political and military alliances that\r\nhave become obsolete. So, let us learn the lessons of the\r\npast and benefit from past experiences so that we may\r\nsatisfy the expectations of the peoples of the United\r\nNations, who aspire after a more united world, where the\r\nrole of the Organization is strengthened on the basis of the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria): For the second time in\r\nrecent years the General Assembly is considering the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council.\r\nSince last year’s debate the Working Group of the\r\nwhole has had an extensive exchange of views. During the\r\ngeneral debate of the current session many heads of\r\ndelegation, including the Foreign Minister of my country,\r\nreferred again to the question of reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We should therefore now be in a position to\r\nadvance the debate in order to prepare the ground\r\nadequately for the necessary decisions, which, in the final\r\nanalysis, will have to be taken at the political level, as was\r\nmade clear this morning by the Permanent Representative\r\nof Singapore.\r\nOn the eve of the Organization’s fiftieth anniversary\r\nwe must ensure that it is well equipped to meet future\r\nchallenges. A reformed Security Council that can rely on\r\nuniversal support will be of vital importance to the\r\nOrganization in the decades to come.\r\nAustria’s position on this issue is as follows.\r\nFirst, the basic guideline for the future composition of\r\nthe Council is the need to ensure its representative character\r\nas well as the effectiveness and efficiency of its work.\r\nThe envisaged enlargement should therefore be limited:\r\nthe number of additional members should be relatively\r\nsmall. We believe that the future composition of the\r\nCouncil should in any case not exceed 25 members.\r\nSecondly, the work of the Security Council has in\r\nthe past greatly benefitted from the input of both\r\ncategories of its members - permanent and\r\nnon-permanent. Thus the necessary continuity in its work\r\nand an appropriate reflection of the international power\r\nstructure were combined with democratic elements\r\nensuring representativeness and providing fresh ideas for\r\nthe solution of impending problems. We therefore argue\r\nfor the maintenance of such a balance between permanent\r\nand non-permanent members.\r\nThirdly, in the debate so far the case has been made\r\nfor additional permanent members. In our view, the\r\nchoice of such members must reflect political and\r\neconomic realities and be based on their ability to\r\ncontribute financially as well as to the overall peace-\r\nkeeping efforts of the United Nations.\r\nFourthly, the future composition of the Security\r\nCouncil should reflect, through an appropriate balance in\r\nits membership, the reality and plurality of today’s world.\r\nIn our view, the addition of a limited number of regional\r\nseats endowed with rights similar to those of the existing\r\npermanent members could meet these requirements.\r\nFifthly, despite some recent improvements - which\r\nwe see as important steps - the question of accessible\r\ninformation channels between members and non-members\r\nof the Council remains an important one and constitutes\r\nan essential part of the discussion on the future\r\ncomposition of the Council. The degree to which Member\r\nStates feel that they are represented by the Council\r\ndepends to a large extent on the existing possibilities for\r\ninteraction with the Council. I listened with great interest\r\nto the constructive proposal in this regard put forward this\r\nmorning by the Ambassador of Brazil.\r\nAustria, as a country with a longstanding tradition in\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping, has a special interest in\r\ncloser cooperation and dialogue between the Security\r\nCouncil, the Secretariat and troop-contributing countries.\r\nWe therefore welcome emerging improvements in this\r\narea. In this context, we attach less relevance to the\r\nconcrete procedure than to the results of such improved\r\ninteraction. We welcome initiatives which have already\r\nbeen taken in this context and value in particular the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\ninitiatives of New Zealand and Argentina. They should be\r\ntaken seriously into consideration. Improved channels of\r\ninformation are also urgently necessary with regard to\r\nproblems resulting for any countries from their compliance\r\nwith sanctions regimes.\r\nLet me submit some considerations on how we might\r\nbest further proceed in the discussion of the item before us.\r\nAfter this debate in plenary, at an appropriate time the\r\nWorking Group of the Whole will be re-established. The\r\nviews of Member States on the issue are by now widely\r\nknown. We should therefore concentrate our work on\r\nconcrete issues in the form of a focused discussion. To this\r\nend, we could define \"building blocks\" which might\r\nbecome constituent elements for a possible consensus or for\r\nthe emergence of positions which might carry wide support.\r\nThis process could be achieved by a combination of\r\ninformal discussions within the Working Group,\r\nguaranteeing adequate transparency and consultation among\r\ninterested members.\r\nAmong possible elements which need further\r\nrefinement through this process, I should like to mention a\r\nfew: a closer indication as to the upper limit of the\r\nSecurity Council membership, bearing in mind that concrete\r\nfigures will only result from a final agreement on the\r\nstructure of the composition of the Council; an appropriate\r\nidentification of principles that will have to be taken into\r\naccount in formulating the future structure of the Council,\r\nsuch as, for instance, the most adequate relationship in\r\nrelative numbers between permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers; possible restrictions in the exercise of the right\r\nto veto - here, I should like to refer to the interesting\r\nremarks made this morning by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Egypt; and an agreement on the types of\r\nmembership to be envisaged, in particular a further\r\nelaboration of proposals to create a new category of\r\nSecurity Council membership in the form of regional seats,\r\nincluding the selection process and the specific rights of\r\nthese members.\r\nIn our view, a discussion of such possible \"building-\r\nblocks\" would help us to narrow the number of possible\r\noptions and to define possible avenues leading to the large\r\nagreement that will be necessary if we want to finalize the\r\nongoing process of constructing a Security Council that will\r\nboth reflect today’s reality and meet the high expectations\r\nvested in this Organization.\r\nMr. Caputo (Italy): I should like first to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session. We are convinced\r\nthat your experience will guide our work with great success.\r\nIt is an honour for me to speak on behalf of the\r\nItalian Government at this forty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on an issue to which we attach special\r\nimportance: the first real reform of the Security Council\r\nsince the birth of the United Nations. My country has\r\nshown its interest in this subject by playing an active role\r\nin the Open-ended Working Group that the General\r\nAssembly set up for this purpose last year; and we pride\r\nourselves on having presented a proposal that we judge to\r\nbe concrete, comprehensive and in the interest of all\r\ncountries.\r\nAllow me to give a quick thumbnail sketch of our\r\nproject. We would keep the number of permanent\r\nmembers at the current five, without adding new ones,\r\nbecause recent historical developments have shown that\r\nvery little is permanent in modern international politics.\r\nWe would instead increase the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers from 10 to 20. The 10 new seats would be\r\nallotted, in turn, to a group of 20 or eventually 30\r\nMember States. The main criteria that could be adopted\r\nto identify these countries are already listed in Article 23\r\nof the Charter. The first is their ability and willingness\r\nto participate in peace-keeping operations with financial,\r\nhuman and military resources. Let us not forget that the\r\nmain purpose of the Council is to maintain peace and\r\nsecurity in the world. The peace-keeping budget already\r\namounts to three times the regular budget of the\r\nOrganization and is increasing. The two other criteria\r\nlisted in Article 23 are equitable geographic distribution\r\nand a country’s contribution to the other purposes of the\r\nOrganization. In addition, other criteria could be taken\r\ninto consideration, such as population size, economic\r\nresources and the willingness to contribute to\r\nhumanitarian causes.\r\nAs we see it, the 20 to 30 countries should be\r\nsubject to periodic review of their performance. In\r\nsubstance, this formula would guarantee the continuous\r\npresence in the Council of the current permanent\r\nmembers and at the same time a more frequent presence\r\nfor 20 or 30 mid-size to large-size countries. Moreover,\r\nthe larger number of members would make it easier to\r\nredress the present geographic imbalance on the Council.\r\nIndeed, after 50 years, it is about time for a new deal.\r\nWe are convinced that our project would also benefit\r\nthe 80 countries that have never been elected to the\r\nSecurity Council and the 43 that have served only once.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nIn fact, as statistics clearly indicate, smaller States have\r\nbeen shut out of the Council by the fierce competition\r\nwithin their regional groups for the few available\r\nnon-permanent seats, sometimes even despite existing\r\nregional agreements. By sheltering these small countries\r\nfrom the competition of the larger ones, we would provide\r\nthem with greater access to the 10 non-permanent seats\r\nwith normal rotation. Of course, one might argue in favour\r\nof open competition for all 20 non-permanent seats on a\r\nbasis of absolute parity, but such an arrangement would\r\nclearly place the smaller States at a disadvantage, since they\r\nwould still risk being elbowed out by the larger ones.\r\nFinally, we believe that a Council of 25 members would\r\nstill be able to function efficiently and effectively, as the\r\nproportion between the original organization of the Security\r\nCouncil and the future one would be maintained.\r\nWe have noted that other interesting and constructive\r\nproposals and suggestions have been presented, while many\r\nothers may be in the pipeline. We welcome them all. In\r\nshort, we intend to continue to participate in the exercise\r\nwith an open mind and a constructive spirit, and to work\r\ntogether with other Member States to obtain the widest\r\npossible consensus. But we insist that everyone - even the\r\nrepresentatives of the smallest countries - be partners at all\r\ntimes in the process, including consultation.\r\nWe fully share the view that there are other, equally\r\nimportant issues concerning the reform. In addition to the\r\nquest for an enlarged Security Council, there is a\r\ncompelling need for a reform of its methods and procedures\r\nand a thorough review of the Council’s relations with the\r\nGeneral Assembly, other organizations, and non-member\r\ncountries. The Council is still operating under the\r\nprovisional rules of procedure, adopted in 1946. It is high\r\ntime the provisional rules were made permanent and were\r\nadapted to the times in which we live.\r\nIt is only natural that the General Assembly, as the\r\nembodiment of the membership of the United Nations,\r\nshould expect thorough and prompt briefings on the\r\nSecurity Council’s activities. At present, however, this\r\nrelationship is limited to a single annual report. This is not\r\nsufficient. Countries not members of the Security Council\r\nthat contribute troops to United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations should, for example, be assured of regular\r\nconsultation on the conduct of an operation in which the\r\nlives of their soldiers are at stake. A consultative\r\nmechanism could be set up by extending Article 44 of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter to operations conducted under\r\nChapter VII.\r\nFinally, greater transparency is required in the\r\nworkings of the Security Council. To this end, we must\r\nadopt measures to provide the United Nations\r\nmembership with more regular information on the debates\r\nin the Security Council and on the various positions that\r\nemerge thence.\r\nThere are two final points that I would like to raise.\r\nFirst, the reform of the Security Council is too crucial an\r\nissue to be left to the work of restricted committees. The\r\nlargest possible number of Countries - including, I repeat,\r\nthe smaller ones - must be put in a position to participate.\r\nTherefore, in order to avoid overburdening small\r\nMissions, we suggest that the ad hoc Working Group not\r\nmeet during the regular session of the General Assembly -\r\nthat is to say, not before January of next year. Frankly,\r\nwe should not feel bound by deadlines, no matter how\r\nimportant the fiftieth anniversary celebration may be,\r\nbecause a mistake today might prove irreversible.\r\nTherefore, let us not hurry, please. As we say in Italy,\r\n\"Premature babies are often stillborn.\"\r\nSecondly, we feel that a consensus must be reached\r\non the principles of the reform before we start singling\r\nout the countries that might be eligible for one league or\r\nthe other.\r\nMay I conclude by assuring the Assembly that we\r\nshall continue to act in an open-minded and constructive\r\nway within the Working Group. We welcome all new\r\nproposals, criticisms and suggestions. Our final goal, one\r\nwhich I am sure we all share, remains that of securing\r\ngreater participation, greater democracy, and greater\r\nefficiency and effectiveness for the Council.\r\nMr. Abdellah (Tunisia) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Allow me first of all, Sir, on my own behalf\r\nand on that of my delegation, to congratulate you on your\r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nand on your outstanding leadership of our work.\r\nIn addition, it is my pleasure to pay a tribute to\r\nAmbassador Insanally, Chairman of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, for his constructive role in seeking\r\ncommon ground and for his contributions to the process\r\nof democratizing the Organization and its organs in order\r\nto fulfil the international community’s oft-expressed\r\naspirations in the framework of the common effort to\r\nestablish a more just, more equitable, new international\r\norder.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nMr. Chaturvedi (India), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe also wish to salute the unflagging efforts of\r\nAmbassador Chew Tai Soo and Ambassador Wilhelm\r\nBreitenstein in leading the Group forward, making it\r\npossible for it to draw up practical recommendations so that\r\nin 1995 we will be able to celebrate the anniversary of a\r\nrevitalized Organization whose institutions enjoy more\r\nequitable representation, transparency and democracy in the\r\ndecision-making process.\r\nThe African Ministers for Foreign Affairs, meeting in\r\nNew York, welcomed the constructive process seeking to\r\nimprove the functioning of the Security Council to reflect\r\nthe new realities of our contemporary world and the\r\ncontributions made by the countries not members of the\r\nCouncil, particularly the developing countries, in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The\r\nAfrican Ministers reaffirmed the importance of close and\r\nconsistent cooperation between the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly. They welcomed the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption of resolution 48/246 of 29 July 1994,\r\nwhich is a new milestone in the creation of more effective\r\ninteraction between those bodies, in accordance with the\r\nspirit and the letter of the Charter. My delegation has at\r\nvarious times stressed this important aspect of the question\r\nto make it possible for the international community to\r\ncontribute more to the management of world affairs for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe noted with great interest the limited but important\r\ninitiatives taken by the Council to promote greater\r\ntransparency in some of its working methods. We urge the\r\nCouncil to continue in that effort to respond to the\r\naspirations of the majority of delegations, as expressed\r\nduring the deliberations of the Working Group established\r\nunder resolution 48/26, implementation of which is in\r\nkeeping with the relevant provisions of the Charter.\r\nThe concern over ensuring collective security and\r\nallowing members of the international community to\r\nparticipate actively in shouldering the collective\r\nresponsibility for security, as entrusted to the international\r\ncommunity by the Charter, compels us to work together to\r\nfacilitate the participation of countries not members of the\r\nCouncil in its deliberations. The Secretariat’s new practice\r\nof convening informal meetings with the participation of\r\nsome members of the Council, as well as the consultations\r\nheld with troop-contributors, are encouraging, but could be\r\nimproved upon and institutionalized.\r\nWe are convinced that recourse to Article 29 of the\r\nCharter for the establishment of one or more subsidiary\r\norgans subordinate to the Security Council has the\r\nadvantage of allowing the Council to entrust deliberations\r\non issues of crucial importance to those larger bodies.\r\nThe credibility of decisions taken by the Council would\r\nonly be enhanced and strengthened.\r\nFurthermore, the proliferation of peace-keeping\r\noperations and the experience gained by the Organization\r\nand by troop-contributing countries lend force to the idea\r\nof adapting the formula of using various types of\r\nconsultations. Accordingly, we deem very useful the idea\r\nof organizing consultations between the Council and\r\ninterested States before a decision is taken on the\r\ntimeliness, goals or duration of peace-keeping operations,\r\nas well as on the resources for implementing them, in\r\norder to give them every chance of success.\r\nThis is not an innovation for us, but rather a matter\r\nof activating provisions of the Charter, in particular\r\nArticle 47, paragraph 2, which allows the Military Staff\r\nCommittee to invite any Member of the Organization to\r\nbe associated with it when the efficient discharge of the\r\nCommittee’s responsibilities requires the participation of\r\nthat Member in its work.\r\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and its\r\nmember States attach special importance to the role of the\r\nCouncil in the areas of peace-keeping and preventive\r\ndiplomacy. The African Heads of State reiterated last\r\nJune at the Tunis Summit their desire to act not only\r\nwithin the regional framework of the OAU to prevent\r\nconflicts through the central African mechanism for the\r\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts but\r\nalso through the active participation of African\r\ncontingents in peace-keeping operations on our continent\r\nand in other areas of conflict outside of Africa.\r\nAfrica therefore pledges its complete cooperation\r\nand readiness to participate in discussions and decision\r\nmaking of the Council. It will spare no effort to help to\r\nincrease the efficiency of the Council in this area and to\r\nensure success for the United Nations in the maintenance\r\nof peace.\r\nWe are convinced that the Working Group of the\r\nGeneral Assembly has reached a stage in its deliberations\r\nwhich makes it possible, with a bit more effort, to outline\r\nconcrete and feasible recommendations with regard to an\r\nincrease in the membership of the Council and to its\r\nfunctioning. In this context, we wish to recall the\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nposition expressed by the Ministers of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement stressing the inadmissibility of any pre-\r\nestablished selection. We must carefully apply the\r\nprovisions of Articles 2 and 23 of the Charter, which spell\r\nout the appropriate criteria for and prohibit any selectivity\r\nor subjectivity in the allocation of seats, thus asserting the\r\nCouncil’s accessibility to any Member State that contributes\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security and\r\nto the other purposes of the Organization, including the\r\npromotion of universal values such as human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, as well as the development of\r\nhuman resources.\r\nOne of the sacrosanct principles of our Organization\r\nis equitable regional representation. In this regard, we\r\nconsider that Africa, like Asia and Latin America, is\r\nentitled to be equitably represented on the Security Council.\r\nI shall take the liberty of recalling the terms of the African\r\nministerial declaration which states that at least two\r\npermanent seats should be given to this continent in the\r\ncourse of the current restructuring process. It goes without\r\nsaying, in our opinion, that rotation continues to be\r\nessential, including within regional groups. It is indeed\r\ncontrary to the very essence of the democratization we are\r\ntrying to achieve in a Security Council adapted to new\r\nrealities to offer special status, in rather questionable\r\nfashion, to a new category of States or seats.\r\nThe delegation of Tunisia welcomes the positive spirit\r\nof consensus that has marked the work of the Security\r\nCouncil in recent years. Such a spirit could further enhance\r\nthe Council’s credibility and gain enthusiastic support from\r\nthe Member States were it consistently reflected by the full,\r\nnon-discriminatory implementation of all of its decisions.\r\nConsensus should, in our opinion, enshrine the\r\nprinciple of the indivisibility of collective security, confer\r\nproper legitimacy on decisions and guarantee their\r\napplicability.\r\nIn this respect, we would like to encourage the\r\nmembers of the Security Council, and especially the\r\npermanent members, to continue actively seeking\r\nconsensus; as was stressed in the ministerial declaration of\r\nthe non-aligned countries, this would certainly spare the\r\nCouncil a paralysis resulting from the exercise of\r\nunreasonable privileges that are ill-suited to the new spirit\r\nin international relations and could threaten regional and\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): My delegation very much\r\nwelcomes the opportunity which item 33 presents us for\r\nreviewing the progress of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup, established by resolution 48/26 to consider all\r\naspects of an increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and other matters related to the Council. An\r\nassessment of what has been achieved thus far and what\r\nremains to be done to fulfil the mandate of the resolution\r\nwill serve to orient our future work with a renewed sense\r\nof purpose.\r\nThe brief, even laconic report presented by the\r\nWorking Group to the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly does not do justice to the extensive and\r\nenlightened discussions which took place on all the issues\r\nthat arose for consideration. Paragraph 8 is limited to\r\nhighlighting only such main areas as the question of size\r\nand composition of the possible increase in the Council’s\r\nmembership. While recognizing that there was a\r\nconvergence of views that the Council should be enlarged,\r\nit states that the scope and nature of the enlargement\r\nwould require further exploration.\r\nAdmittedly, circumstances did not permit a more\r\ncomprehensive and detailed account of the Working\r\nGroup’s deliberations. Guided by the principle that all\r\naspects of its mandate are interlinked and must be settled\r\nsimultaneously, areas of specific agreement could not be\r\nlisted. Yet it would be a great pity, in the view of my\r\ndelegation, if the tacit nature of the report were now to\r\ninvite a return to an exposition of matters already amply\r\nventilated. Were this to happen, we would waste a great\r\ndeal of time and perhaps lose the unique opportunity we\r\nhave at this moment to create a more democratic and\r\nefficient Security Council.\r\nWe would therefore do well to remind ourselves, as\r\nwe are about to embark on further work at this forty-ninth\r\nsession, of the primary aim of the exercise in which we\r\nare engaged. Clearly, our task is to bring about an\r\nincrease in the Council’s membership that would be more\r\nrepresentative of the United Nations today. The present\r\nsize and composition of the Council cannot be deemed by\r\nany yardstick to be equitable now. The Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Indonesia and Chairman of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement reflected in his statement this\r\nmorning some of the outstanding concerns which we\r\nshare in this regard.\r\nThus far, much of our discussion of the question of\r\nsize and composition appears to have been largely driven\r\nby financial considerations allowing for the addition of\r\none or two States to the category of permanent member.\r\nUnderstandably, peace-keeping operations, which are\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\ntoday the main burden of the Council, demand significant\r\nresources such as these new members are thought capable\r\nof providing. We believe, however, that permanent\r\nmembership should not be limited only to a select group of\r\nmajor military or economic Powers, but should also be\r\nopen to developing countries which have a contribution to\r\nmake to the Council’s work. We rather fear, however, that\r\nany proposal for additional permanent members may now\r\nquickly become bogged down by the question of whether\r\nany such new members should have the right of veto.\r\nThese aspirants could insist on having the same\r\nentitlement as all other permanent members, since anything\r\nless may suggest an inferior status. However, in the light\r\nof the history of the condemnation of the veto, even of its\r\napplication in particular instances by the permanent\r\nmembers themselves, it would be reasonable to assume that\r\nany suggestion of an extension of the veto could be\r\ncontroversial and lead to an early impasse in the\r\ndiscussions of the Working Group.\r\nMoreover, we do not think that there can be ready\r\nagreement on additional permanent members unless there is\r\na concomitant acceptance of an appropriate number of\r\nnon-permanent members that would satisfy the requirement\r\nof a balanced and equitable representation of all States -\r\nboth developed and developing - on the Council.\r\nAs a priority task, some reasonable ratio will have to\r\nbe found between the numbers of permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members, as well as any new category of\r\nmembers that may emerge to cater for regional\r\nrepresentation on a rotational basis. Such regional\r\nrepresentation can conceivably satisfy the interests of larger\r\ncountries without unduly swelling the ranks of the\r\npermanent members. It is important to ensure, however,\r\nthat no one region is over-represented in terms of numbers\r\nof permanent members, and that there is a proper balance\r\namong all categories. To this end, the overall composition\r\nof the Council must be reviewed to ensure that the principle\r\nof equity is fully respected.\r\nMany States have provided, through their written\r\nsubmissions to the Secretary-General and their statements\r\nto both the plenary and the Working Group, their several\r\nconcepts of a model Security Council. Although there are\r\nsome differences of specification, the principal features of\r\ndesign are common to most submissions, namely, equitable\r\nrepresentation, transparency and effectiveness of operations.\r\nAs far as the question of numbers is concerned, the\r\neventual figure seems to oscillate somewhere between 20\r\nand 25. With these broad characteristics in mind, the\r\nWorking Group can, I think, now go to the drawing board\r\nin an attempt to give shape to the new Council.\r\nAs far as the second major cluster of issues is\r\nconcerned, namely, those relating to other matters, my\r\ndelegation is satisfied that appreciable progress was made\r\nduring the last session of the Assembly. The early\r\nconsideration to be given by this body to the report of the\r\nSecurity Council testifies to the possibilities of the greater\r\ncommunication and cooperation that can exist between\r\nthese two important organs. The Council has, to its\r\ncredit, taken several initiatives to make its work more\r\nopen and transparent. As it continues in this direction,\r\nboth the credibility and the legitimacy of its actions will\r\nbe commensurately enhanced. With regard to the\r\nquestion of decision-making and all other matters related\r\nto the Council, these are likely to fall into place once the\r\nmajor issues are resolved.\r\nIn order to build upon the progress that was\r\nachieved at the forty-eighth session, the Working Group\r\nwill need to find a mechanism for sifting the many ideas\r\nand proposals which have been advanced in order to\r\nidentify those which can be translated by consensus into\r\nreality. It will therefore have to go beyond set statements\r\nof position to an informal and frank exchange of views\r\ndesigned to pinpoint possible areas of agreement. The\r\nuse of such a mechanism must, of course, be without\r\nprejudice to the integrity of the Working Group, which\r\nshould remain at all times open and transparent in its\r\nfunctions. Consequently, all matters treated by any\r\nauxiliary mechanism must be ad referendum to the Group\r\nas a whole.\r\nWe may also do well at this stage to give some\r\nthought to the time frame within which our work might\r\nbe completed. In its wisdom, the Assembly placed no\r\nconstraints that would prevent us from giving ample\r\nconsideration to all the important issues before us. We\r\nshould therefore not force those issues to any premature\r\nconclusion, but rather test them thoroughly for widespread\r\nacceptance. None the less, we should not unduly delay a\r\nprocess which is aimed at strengthening the capacity of\r\nthe Security Council to deal with the many challenges\r\nwhich it now faces in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. The sooner this goal is achieved, the\r\nbetter it would be for the entire international community.\r\nMy delegation is confident that under Mr. Essy’s\r\nleadership, and with the able assistance of his two Vice-\r\nChairmen, the Working Group will continue to make\r\nprogress in the discharge of its mandate. The celebration\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nnext year of the Organization’s fiftieth anniversary is\r\ncertain to provide a strong psychological impetus to the\r\nprocess. We would therefore hope that, without being\r\nstrait-jacketed by any considerations of time, we will work\r\ndiligently to bring our labour to an early and full fruition.\r\nMr. Batu (Turkey): The crucial challenge before us\r\ntoday is to make the United Nations a real centre for\r\nuniversal solidarity by improving its effectiveness and by\r\nharmonizing its work with the new imperatives of our\r\ntimes. In this context, the focus of attention should be the\r\nSecurity Council, which bears primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe widespread demands for making that principal\r\norgan more representative, responsive, transparent and\r\naccountable should be met. The new international political\r\nenvironment requires the democratization of the Council.\r\nThe Council has to be restructured to reflect the new\r\nrealities. In order to enable the Council to discharge its\r\nexpanded responsibilities more effectively, the moral\r\nauthority of the Council should be reinforced. These are\r\nthe pressing needs to be met in order to have guaranteed\r\ninternational support in responding to new challenges and\r\nthreats to international peace and security. It is in line with\r\nthis understanding that my delegation has actively\r\nparticipated in the first two rounds of the deliberations of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council.\r\nHaving taken note of the report on the progress of\r\nwork of the Open-ended Working Group, we believe that\r\nthe next stage of deliberations should be held on the basis\r\nof concrete proposals. We must build on the work done in\r\nthe course of the forty-eighth session.\r\nThere are mainly two aspects of our work which\r\nrequire equal attention. We have to enhance the\r\nrepresentative weight of the Council and democratize its\r\nmethod of work.\r\nLet me dwell on the first point. The enhancement of\r\nthe representativeness of the Council cannot be confined\r\nmerely to a quantitative expansion of its size. The\r\nmodalities of the enlargement should also be elaborated.\r\nWe do not believe that an increase in the overall number of\r\nseats alone will suffice in securing more equitable and\r\nrepresentative participation in the work of the Council. The\r\nenlargement should be coupled with a fair system of\r\nworkable rotation. In this context, we firmly believe that\r\nthe proposal submitted by Italy to the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group merits careful consideration.\r\nThe idea that there is a correlation between the size\r\nof the Council and its efficiency is inherently misleading.\r\nThe determining factor in increasing the efficiency of the\r\nwork of the Council will be the political will of its\r\nmembers and the support of the general membership,\r\nrather than its size. The Council will become more\r\neffective when it is perceived by the international\r\ncommunity as being more equitably representative of the\r\ngeneral membership, and thus more authoritative in its\r\ndecisions.\r\nThe present dichotomy - a Council that is relatively\r\nmore efficient in its deliberations, yet, in turn, less\r\neffective in implementing its decisions - calls for\r\nthorough consideration.\r\nIt is in line with this reasoning that we endorse, in\r\ngeneral, the proposal by Italy. We hold the view that the\r\nSecurity Council should be enlarged by 10 additional\r\nnon-permanent members. This new membership should\r\nrotate among a list of countries. However, this list could\r\nbe updated after a certain time so that it does not lead to\r\nnew privileges.\r\nOn the other hand, we believe that extending the\r\nconcept of separate constituencies to the distribution of all\r\nelective seats is worthy of consideration. Designating, for\r\neach elective seat, separate constituencies representing\r\nmore or less equal potential and means, as well as a\r\ncommon determination to contribute to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, could enhance the\r\nrepresentative weight of the Council and ensure more\r\nequitable geographical distribution. Setting up new\r\nconstituencies for election could be one of the most\r\neffective ways to rectify the shortcomings and injustices\r\nof the present election system.\r\nAlong with this idea of radical reform, we could also\r\nstart thinking about finding ways and means within the\r\ngeographical groups of ensuring a fair, equitable and\r\nworkable system of rotation for all the non-permanent\r\nseats, including the 10 additional new members. My\r\ndelegation will present these ideas in written form to the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group in its new round of\r\ndeliberations.\r\nReform of the Council’s working methods is the\r\nother aspect of our work. I do not wish to go into detail\r\nonce again on this issue. We have explained our views\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nin the Working Group, and we will continue to elaborate on\r\nthem. However, I should like to underline that most of the\r\nideas that have been presented to the Working Group in this\r\nrespect do not require an amendment to the Charter. We\r\nbelieve, therefore, that we could finalize this part of our\r\nwork more easily. In the same vein, the Council’s rules of\r\nprocedure, which are still provisional after almost 50 years,\r\nshould be finalized to reflect the spirit of democratization.\r\nOur aim should be to make the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup a genuine driving force for real reform. We have to\r\ncreate a Security Council that is more effective,\r\nrepresentative, transparent, accountable, credible and\r\nauthoritative. This is a historic task which we must fulfil.\r\nMr. Azwai (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): The adoption by the General Assembly of\r\nresolution 47/62 on the question of equitable representation\r\non and increase of the membership of the Security Council\r\nreflects the extent of the determination of the Members of\r\nthe United Nations to put an end to the unfair composition\r\nof the Security Council. As currently composed and\r\nworking as it has been, the Council is in need of reform in\r\norder to respond to changes in the international situation.\r\nOn the international scene, new States have emerged, while\r\nthe role of others has diminished. Moreover, the number\r\nof Members of the United Nations, on whose behalf the\r\nCouncil works, has greatly increased.\r\nBy its resolution 48/26, the Assembly established a\r\nWorking Group entrusted with the study of all aspects of\r\nthe question of increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, and other matters relating to the Security Council.\r\nDuring the last session, the Working Group held numerous\r\nmeetings, and the results of its work are contained in\r\ndocument A/48/47. My delegation has perused the contents\r\nof that report and believes that the next phase of the\r\nGroup’s work will be particularly important, in view of the\r\nfact that it has to submit to the Assembly specific\r\nrecommendations on the increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and on reforming its methods of work. In\r\nthis respect, my country believes that, in carrying out its\r\nmandate, the Working Group should base itself on the\r\nprinciple of the full sovereign equality of States. The\r\nmethodology of increasing the membership should be\r\nguided by this principle and not by particular choices or by\r\nany specific political, economic or military considerations.\r\nMoreover, my delegation believes that the Working\r\nGroup should consider the other part of its mandate: the\r\nquestion of the equitable geographical distribution of the\r\nmembership of the Council, and the correction of the\r\ncurrent imbalance in its composition due to the under-\r\nrepresentation on the Council of developing countries,\r\nespecially those of Africa, Asia and Latin America.\r\nIncreasing the membership of the Security Council\r\nand democratizing its composition should be studied as an\r\nintegral part of the process of reforming the Council and\r\nof improving its methods of work, including its decision-\r\nmaking processes and the manner in which its resolutions\r\nare adopted. In this respect, my country’s delegation\r\nwould like to underscore the need for the proposed reform\r\nto ensure that the Security Council should work within its\r\ncompetence under the Charter and to do so with full\r\nobjectivity and neutrality, without interfering in the\r\ninternal affairs of States under pressure by certain States\r\nor in response to their wishes. In addition, the Security\r\nCouncil, in order for it to be able to deal effectively with\r\ninternational questions, should not usurp the functions of\r\nother bodies or involve itself in questions that fall within\r\nthe competence of other main organs of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMy country’s delegation also would like to\r\nunderscore the need to do away with the factors that\r\nimpede the performance by the Council of its role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, especially\r\nthe power of veto, which should be eliminated since the\r\nreasons behind its granting have ceased to exist. The\r\ncontinued existence of that power would perpetuate the\r\nlack of full sovereign co-equality amongst the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nEffective reform of the Security Council and, in\r\nparticular, the improvement of its working methods,\r\nnecessitate transparency in the Council’s activities. This\r\ntransparency should characterize also the stage preceding\r\nthe adoption of resolutions. My country’s delegation\r\nbelieves that, to achieve this, the Council should consult\r\nwith the countries concerned on the questions of which it\r\nis seized. The Council should also consult with the\r\nrelevant regional organizations. Previous practice\r\nindicates that the Council has ignored the need to engage\r\nin such consultation. Some of its States members have\r\neven refused to take into consideration the views of\r\ncertain States that were directly concerned with questions\r\nbefore the Council. To guarantee the universal\r\nacceptance and implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions, my country’s delegation believes that, before\r\ndeciding to adopt such resolutions, the Security Council\r\nshould engage in wider consultation - not in the context\r\nof informal consultations, but in formal meetings open to\r\nall Member States.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nIn conclusion, my country’s delegation would like\r\nonce again to underline the extreme importance of this\r\nquestion, which is directly related to international peace and\r\nsecurity and to relations between nations and peoples. That\r\nis why we should take the necessary time and seriously\r\nstudy this issue in order for us to be able to decide on and\r\nintroduce the desired reforms of the Security Council in a\r\ndemocratic manner that would emphasize the responsibility\r\nof all peoples, big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, in\r\ncreating a new world of peace and cooperation that will be\r\nfree from policies of hegemony and influence. The\r\nparameters of such a new world should be such that they\r\nwould engender continued cooperation amongst States and\r\ncreate development and growth opportunities that measure\r\nup to the challenges of poverty, ignorance and\r\nbackwardness and the need to consolidate peace amongst\r\nStates and peoples.\r\nMr. Owada (Japan): Over the past two and a half\r\nweeks, during the Assembly’s general debate, we heard the\r\nrepresentatives of more than 170 countries. A great\r\nmajority of them touched upon the question of the reform\r\nof the United Nations, particularly as it relates to the\r\nSecurity Council. This is clear evidence of the keen\r\ninterest that Member States have in the question of the\r\nreform of the Security Council and a manifestation of their\r\npolitical will to achieve concrete results in this exercise. If\r\nwe are serious in our endeavour to strengthen the United\r\nNations as the centrepiece of the international order that is\r\nto be consolidated in the post-cold-war world, it is\r\nimportant that we maintain and even intensify this\r\nmomentum to move forward on this crucial question during\r\nthe current session of the General Assembly.\r\nIn this post-cold-war era, only through joint efforts of\r\nthe international community can we sustain and promote\r\nworld peace and stability. The United Nations is expected\r\nto play a central role in this concerted endeavour of ours.\r\nIt was against that background that the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Japan, Mr. Yohei Kono, stated in his address to\r\nthe General Assembly on 27 September that Japan was\r\nresolved to conduct a proactive foreign policy in its effort\r\nto assume its share of responsibility and to contribute to the\r\nfuture well-being of humankind on a level commensurate\r\nwith its political and economic status.\r\nThe Foreign Minister expounded the basic philosophy\r\nunderlying this resolve of Japan in relation to its\r\ninternational responsibility in the following terms:\r\n\"Reflecting with remorse upon the Second World\r\nWar, Japan has never wavered from its commitment\r\nto contribute to world peace and prosperity. Japan\r\ndoes not, nor will it, resort to the use of force\r\nprohibited by its Constitution. Japan will remain\r\nresolutely a nation of peace. Neither possessing\r\nnuclear arms nor exporting weapons, Japan\r\ncontinues to be actively engaged in disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation efforts. In accordance with what\r\nI have just stated, Japan has dispatched members of\r\nits Self-Defence Forces, as well as civilian\r\npersonnel, to several countries, including Cambodia\r\nand Mozambique, in response to requests by the\r\nUnited Nations. Japan intends to continue to\r\ncooperate actively in such United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\n\"At the same time, Japan is determined to\r\nenhance its contributions to efforts on global issues\r\nin [such] economic and social areas ... [as]\r\ndevelopment, the environment, human rights,\r\nrefugees, population, AIDS and narcotics.\" (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Forty-ninth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 7th meeting, pp. 12-13)\r\nIt is on the basis of that philosophy of Japan that\r\nForeign Minister Kono stated that, with the endorsement\r\nof many countries, Japan was prepared to discharge the\r\nresponsibilities of a permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nJapan is firmly convinced that the United Nations\r\nmust be reformed to meet the many major challenges that\r\nthe world now faces and that to this end the Security\r\nCouncil must be reformed to render it more reflective of\r\ntoday’s world and to enable it to respond more effectively\r\nto the growing expectations of the international\r\ncommunity. In particular, the Council will have to be\r\nrestructured to reflect the new realities of the world,\r\nwhere the membership of the United Nations has\r\ndramatically expanded and where new global Powers have\r\nemerged with the will and the capacity to carry out\r\ngreater international responsibilities. Needless to say, the\r\nvery purpose of the reform of the Security Council is to\r\nenhance the effectiveness of that organ. It is incumbent\r\nupon all of us, therefore, to exercise our utmost care to\r\nensure that the effectiveness and efficiency of the Council\r\nare not jeopardized as a result of our attempt to effect\r\nreforms.\r\nIf the United Nations is to play a more active and\r\neffective role for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, as we believe it must, reform of the Security\r\nCouncil is without a doubt the most urgent task now\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nfacing the Organization. From that viewpoint, my\r\ndelegation is gratified to note that the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council has\r\nconducted extensive and intensive discussions on this\r\ncrucial question since the beginning of this year. The\r\nWorking Group submitted its report to the General\r\nAssembly at its previous session, and the Assembly has\r\nnow decided that the Group should continue its work during\r\nthe current, forty-ninth, session of the General Assembly.\r\nIn the light of the discussion held thus far and on the basis\r\nof that report, I wish to offer a few salient points which\r\nshould guide our future deliberations within the Working\r\nGroup, so that we may make further progress on this all-\r\nimportant question.\r\nAs a basic framework of our future endeavour, it is\r\nimperative to build upon what we have achieved in the\r\ncourse of our discussions within the Working Group. A\r\nlarge number of Member States have actively participated\r\nin the deliberations of the Working Group and expressed\r\ntheir views and positions upon all the pertinent aspects of\r\nthe issue. As a result, I believe that there has emerged a\r\nconsensus on the point that, in view of the paramount\r\nimportance of the Security Council, the reform efforts\r\nshould be directed towards enhancing its legitimacy and\r\ncredibility so that it can function truly effectively as the\r\nexecutive organ of the United Nations entrusted with the\r\nprimary task of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMore specifically, it would seem generally agreed that\r\na genuine effort to reform the Security Council will have to\r\nbe pursued in two directions: reform of its organization\r\nand reform of its functioning.\r\nFirst, with regard to the question of organization of the\r\nSecurity Council, it is noteworthy that there has been a\r\nconvergence of views in the Working Group on the need to\r\nenlarge the membership of the Council. In considering how\r\nthis might be done, my delegation believes that it is\r\nessential to address the following three fundamental aspects:\r\nthe emergence of new global Powers, which\r\nprompts us to envisage a limited increase in the\r\nnumber of permanent seats in addition to the\r\ncurrent permanent members;\r\nthe drastic expansion of United Nations\r\nmembership, which requires us to consider an\r\nappropriate increase in the number of\r\nnon-permanent seats to improve the\r\nrepresentativeness of the Security Council;\r\nthe imbalance that has emerged in the\r\ngeographical representation within the Council,\r\nwhich suggests that we should redress the\r\noverall distribution of seats.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the question of the\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council, issues such as\r\nimproving the transparency of its work, strengthening the\r\ncommunication between members and non-members and\r\nso forth, have been raised under the rubric of \"other\r\nmatters related to the Security Council\". A number of\r\nproposals have been submitted on this score, including a\r\nfew by my own delegation. My delegation believes that\r\nit is now incumbent upon us to set out to examine if and\r\nto what extent these proposals are feasible and\r\npracticable. In any case, we firmly believe that\r\nimproving the working methods of the Council will\r\ngreatly contribute to the enhancement of the legitimacy\r\nand credibility of that organ.\r\nI wish to reiterate that reform of the organization of\r\nthe Council and reform of its functioning, as I have\r\nbriefly described, are the two issues which together form\r\nthe basis of an overall plan to reform the Security\r\nCouncil. It is the considered view of my delegation that\r\nthese two issues therefore should be examined\r\nconcurrently and agreement should be reached on both\r\nissues as soon as possible.\r\nFinally, I should like to touch upon a procedural, but\r\nnone the less important, question as to how the Working\r\nGroup might best organize its work and proceed with its\r\ndeliberations during the current session of the General\r\nAssembly. As I noted earlier, the Working Group is\r\nexpected to continue its efforts, building upon the results\r\nof its work during the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. In the view of my delegation, the next round\r\nof the deliberations should therefore be qualitatively\r\ndifferent from the previous round. To put it more\r\nspecifically, I believe we should go beyond the exchange\r\nof respective positions of different delegations to move\r\ninto the stage of formulating a package of concrete\r\nproposals to form a basis of agreement.\r\nIn order to proceed along these lines, my delegation\r\nbelieves it is important that the Working Group\r\ncommence its deliberations as early as possible. As a\r\nprerequisite to this, we have to decide promptly upon the\r\ncomposition of the Bureau for the current session. I wish\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nto state that my delegation is in favour of the solution that\r\nthe President of the current session of the General\r\nAssembly serve as the Chairman of the Working Group\r\nduring the present session, following the practice\r\nestablished last year. Further, my delegation strongly hopes\r\nthat the representatives of Finland and Singapore will\r\ncontinue to serve as Vice-Chairmen in view of the\r\nimportance of maintaining the continuity of our work and\r\nin the light of the invaluable contribution they made to the\r\nwork of the Working Group during the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFurthermore, in order to ensure progress in our work\r\nin a constructive direction, the Working Group will benefit\r\ngreatly from informal consultations to be conducted parallel\r\nwith its formal meetings. This will enable us to winnow\r\nout various options that are presented and expedite the\r\nprocess for realizing the convergence of views in our work.\r\nLet me close by expressing my delegation’s sincere\r\nhope that the deliberations of the Working Group on this\r\nimportant topic will be accelerated, so that we may hope to\r\nreach agreement on a reform plan in time for the\r\ncommemorative fiftieth session of the General Assembly\r\nnext year. My delegation is prepared to offer its full\r\ncooperation in order to achieve this goal in our common\r\nendeavour.\r\nMr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have now come to the end of a year of intensive\r\ndiscussions in the Assembly’s Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council. This\r\nyear of difficult discussions was, we believe, useful, even\r\nif it has not yet resulted in any narrowing of the gap\r\nbetween our positions. We have today, more clearly than\r\na year ago, a list of the problems to be resolved in order to\r\nreach an acceptable formula, and a list of the diverse\r\naspirations of delegations in this exercise.\r\nThis will be useful as we continue our work, in the\r\nphase that should now begin, of trying to reach a successful\r\nconclusion. I wish to thank Mr. Insanally for his personal\r\ncontribution to the success of the consultations during the\r\nlast session. I should also like to commend Mr. Chew Tai\r\nSoo, the Ambassador of Singapore, and Mr. Breitenstein,\r\nthe Ambassador of Finland, who were outstanding Vice-\r\nChairmen and who are to continue in that role this year.\r\nWe are all very happy about that. The interest publicly\r\ndemonstrated on the subject by the President of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. Amara Essy, is also an excellent omen, and\r\nwe are pleased that he has assumed office at a decisive\r\ntime in the exercise.\r\nThe lesson that we draw from the work of the forty-\r\neighth session is that we must show plenty of realism in\r\norder to devise a formula for enlarging the Security\r\nCouncil while meeting the desire of Members for greater\r\nrepresentativeness, compatible with effectiveness in\r\nconfronting emergencies which the Council must respond.\r\nThere is no miracle solution here. But some realities\r\nshould, we hope, gradually be accepted.\r\nFirst of all, some States that are capable of making\r\na decisive contribution to the United Nations in the\r\nmaintenance of peace want to shoulder greater\r\nresponsibilities in the Security Council. Germany and\r\nJapan are, in my delegation’s opinion, fully eligible to sit\r\nin the Security Council as permanent members, with all\r\nthe prerogatives and obligations of the present permanent\r\nmembers. My delegation’s view is that it would be in the\r\nbest interests of the United Nations to grant seats to these\r\ntwo States to enable them to shoulder the responsibilities\r\nto which they aspire.\r\nSecondly, an increase in the representation of the\r\nmore advanced countries must not create an imbalance\r\nthat operates to the detriment of the developing world.\r\nThis means that if Japan and Germany were to join the\r\nSecurity Council as permanent members, a seat should be\r\ngiven to the developing countries to preserve a desirable\r\nbalance.\r\nAs for the modalities to ensure such complementary\r\nrepresentation, my delegation is open to all suggestions at\r\nthis stage; we do not rule out anything. For us this is not\r\na question of principle on which permanent members\r\nhave any particular concept to defend. We need to find\r\na compromise in the form of an arrangement or set of\r\narrangements which it is generally agreed improves the\r\nrepresentation in the Council. That might mean\r\npermanent membership for certain major countries from\r\nthe South. My delegation does not see any obstacle in\r\nprinciple to that. It might also mean, either as a\r\ncomplementary or as an alternative formula, an increase\r\nin the number of non-permanent members, provided that\r\nthe increase is only moderate and would not paralyse the\r\nCouncil’s work. We could envisage a membership of\r\nabout 20. Making the non-permanent members eligible\r\nfor another term after their two years in the Security\r\nCouncil would provide some flexibility in the formulas\r\nfor representation.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nOn the other aspect of the discussions under way - that\r\nis, enhancing the Security Council’s methods of work with\r\na view to strengthening it, our goals are equally clear. We\r\nwish to respect the balance of the present configuration of\r\nthe organs by using all the possibilities it offers to establish\r\ntrust between the Security Council and the Member States,\r\nin particular those that are making a special contribution to\r\ninternational peace and security by providing troops to\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nThe Council has already made considerable progress\r\non all these questions in recent months. The abiding\r\nconcern of its members is to ensure clarity in the way its\r\ndecisions are taken and transmitted. We are sure that if we\r\nare vigilant on this score, we shall have even better results.\r\nThere are of course some principles that we intend to\r\ndefend vigorously: First, the Council must remain the sole\r\nmaster of its decision-making process. Secondly, it should\r\nnot give way to the temptation to micromanage peace-\r\nkeeping operations; they must continue to be managed by\r\nthe Secretary-General. Thirdly, it should be careful not to\r\nmake the consultation meetings too formal; the very point\r\nof the consultations is that they allow for great flexibility of\r\norganization.\r\nBut, without infringing those principles, the Council\r\ndoes have one way to ensure that Members of the\r\nOrganization get a better hearing. Quite simply, as the\r\nFrench Minister for Foreign Affairs said in his address to\r\nthe General Assembly, it is to reinvigorate public debate in\r\nthe Council. To ensure efficiency in dealing with its heavy\r\nworkload, the Council has for several years worked almost\r\nexclusively in informal consultations and, accordingly,\r\npublic debate has been reduced to a succession of routine\r\nspeeches delivered after the Council has already determined\r\nwhat decision it will take. We believe that, without giving\r\nup the advantages of informal consultations, we should\r\nenrich the debate by allowing members of the Council to\r\nhave a dialogue with the Member States of the Organization\r\nin a public meeting before a position has been decided on -\r\nat least on important questions. The frustration that many\r\ndelegations feel about the current methods of working could\r\nbe resolved without impairing the Council’s ability to react\r\nto situations.\r\nI am convinced that there will be much decisive\r\nprogress next year on both aspects of this work, heralding\r\na welcome compromise between different but quite\r\nlegitimate aspirations of the Members of the United Nations\r\nabout the future of the Organization and the role they will\r\nplay in it.\r\nMrs. Frechette (Canada): I should like to\r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly on his\r\nelection and pay tribute to his predecessor, who skillfully\r\nguided the work of the General Assembly and the\r\nWorking Group on the reform of the Security Council.\r\nWe would also like to thank both Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nWorking Group, the Permanent Representatives of\r\nFinland and Singapore, whose tireless efforts greatly\r\nfacilitated our work.\r\nThe year that has passed since our last debate on this\r\nsubject has been fruitful as we have been able within the\r\nWorking Group to begin a dialogue and start to identify\r\ncertain areas of convergence. As indicated in the report\r\nof the Working Group there is a convergence of views on\r\nthe need to increase the Council’s membership. This is\r\nin itself a worthwhile result, given the complexity of the\r\nexercise. We hope that we will be able from now on to\r\ndevote our energies to discussing the terms of expansion.\r\nThe report also rightly notes that the Council has\r\ntaken certain steps to improve its methods of work and\r\nprocedures. The progress made in this respect bodes well\r\nfor further transparency in its work and increased\r\nconsultations with interested Member States.\r\nIn our opinion, the expansion of the Security Council\r\nshould accomplish four objectives: to make the Council\r\nmore representative, to improve its efficiency, to improve\r\nits credibility and to improve its equity.\r\nAn expanded Council will be more representative if\r\na wider variety of interests and points of view can be\r\nexpressed, while keeping in mind the principle of\r\nequitable geographical distribution set out in the Charter.\r\nHowever, this does not mean that members of the Council\r\nmust become representatives of groups of Member States.\r\nOn the contrary, it is important that while conducting\r\nbroad consultations Council members continue to assume\r\nthe individual responsibility conferred on them by the\r\nCharter and through their election by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAn expanded Council will continue to be efficient if\r\nits expansion is limited; it will still be able to make\r\nprompt and effective decisions as it is called upon to do.\r\nAn expanded Council will be more credible if its\r\ncomposition reflects the emergence of new important\r\nactors on the international scene. But it should also\r\nreflect the sustained contribution of certain countries over\r\nthe years to the maintenance of international peace and\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nsecurity and to the other purposes of the Organization. We\r\nthink that it would be in the interests of the Organization\r\nfor these countries to have more frequent or systematic\r\naccess to Council membership. Their presence would\r\nincrease the Council’s credibility, since these nations should\r\nbe willing to assume, or to continue to assume, a larger\r\nshare of our collective responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nFinally, an expanded, more equitable Council will\r\nimprove the chances for countries that seek Council\r\nmembership.\r\nThe viewpoints of Member States on the expansion of\r\nthe Council are well known. It is now time to step up our\r\nwork and start identifying other areas of convergence, as\r\nthe Chairman of our Working Group attempted to do last\r\nyear. For example, we have detected an emerging\r\nconvergence of views on the desirable number of members\r\n- in the low twenties - for an expanded Council.\r\nThere is no miracle solution to the question of\r\nexpanding the Security Council. Therefore, we must first of\r\nall continue to approach this exercise by focusing our\r\nefforts on our common objectives and by being flexible on\r\nthe modalities of expansion. We should be ready to use our\r\nimagination and to consider different options. In this\r\nconnection, new ideas such as those advanced by Italy and\r\nAustralia could provide elements of a solution, and they\r\nmerit further study.\r\nCanada is open to a number of possibilities: creating\r\nnew permanent seats, establishing a category of\r\nsemi-permanent seats, creating new non-permanent seats\r\nwith or without the possibility of re-election, or reviewing\r\nthe composition of regional groups. In our opinion, none of\r\nthese ideas excludes any other.\r\nWe think that the concept of semi-permanent seats, to\r\nbe shared for two-year periods by two or more countries, is\r\nparticularly interesting and warrants further exploration. The\r\ncreation of such a category would have the double\r\nadvantage of allowing countries that more fully meet the\r\nrequirements of Article 23 of the Charter to sit more\r\nfrequently on the Council and of lessening the number of\r\ncandidates for non-permanent Member status.\r\nAlthough the Council has made a great deal of\r\nprogress in this direction, we feel that it must continue to\r\nimprove its methods of work. In particular, Canada feels\r\nthat the Council can find practical means of\r\ninstitutionalizing its consultations with troop-contributing\r\nnations. At present, 75 countries are providing contingents\r\n- 78,000 troops in all - for United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations. The Council must take into account this rapid\r\nand dramatic evolution in the importance of peace-\r\nkeeping, and enter into direct and regular consultations\r\nwith the countries that volunteer to implement the\r\ndecisions of the Security Council.\r\nWithout challenging the Council’s responsibility for\r\nmaking the decisions required, this means that the Council\r\nshould hold consultations with troop-contributing nations\r\nwhen renewing mandates and when significant events\r\noccur during the course of these operations. We hope that\r\nthe Council will clearly recognize this necessity and fully\r\ncommit itself to such consultations.\r\nMembers can rely on the cooperation of our\r\ndelegation to make constructive progress in our work as\r\nwe seek to achieve concrete results as soon as possible.\r\nMr. Laing (Belize): The delegation of Belize\r\nwishes, through our current President, to thank his\r\npredecessor, the former President of the General\r\nAssembly, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, and the\r\nAmbassadors of Finland and Singapore for their\r\ncommendable efforts in steering the deliberations of last\r\nsession’s Working Group on this important question. We\r\nare confident that under our current President’s able\r\nleadership this matter will be significantly advanced\r\nduring the current session. There is hardly any matter of\r\ngreater importance on this Assembly’s agenda. After all,\r\npeace and security are indispensable for effective\r\ndemocracy and development. Hence, democratization of\r\nthe Security Council must be the critical issue of our\r\ntime.\r\nThe existence of the veto is the main reason why the\r\nprocess of reform has been retarded. Its existence partly\r\nexplains the variety of claims for permanent membership\r\nby individual States and, we have been given to\r\nunderstand, by some who would speak on behalf of some\r\nof the United Nations regions. It has motivated such\r\ninteresting proposals as that for semi-permanent\r\nmembership. All of this is quite understandable, since the\r\nmain attribute of permanent membership is the veto.\r\nDuring the past several months, this delegation and\r\nseveral others have proposed that, if it cannot be\r\ncompletely abolished, the veto institution should be\r\nreformed. Of the two reform proposals that Belize has\r\nendorsed, the one which seems to have the largest number\r\nof supporters is the idea that the purported exercise of the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nveto by one permanent member must, to be successful,\r\nhave the support of at least one other permanent member.\r\nWith the veto so modified, the notion of permanent\r\nmembership can itself be modified. After all, the rationale\r\nfor permanent membership, as we know it, becomes\r\nirrelevant if there is no absolute right of veto. The\r\ndiscussion in the Working Group during the past several\r\nmonths has made it clear that it is this attribute of\r\npermanent membership that has stymied our efforts to agree\r\non several matters. These include criteria for membership\r\nof the Council, the question of equity as it relates to\r\ndeveloping countries and the number of members of an\r\nenlarged Council.\r\nIt is clear that in the new world order, democracy and\r\nequality are the paramount values. For self-evident reasons,\r\nthese should be reflected in various aspects of each body of\r\nour Organization, especially in the title and incidents of\r\nmembership of the Security Council. This delegation\r\ntherefore proposes that there should be two classes of\r\nmembers: indefinite members, to replace the existing\r\ncategory of permanent members, and regular members, to\r\nreplace the present category of non-permanent members.\r\nEach indefinite member would sit on the Council as long as\r\nit satisfied the relevant criteria. Let it be stressed that our\r\nproposals are equally applicable if the two present classes\r\nof permanent and non-permanent members are retained.\r\nThe criteria for indefinite membership should be\r\ngrounded in the realities of international relations. This\r\ndelegation proposes that the most crucial realities here are\r\nsize of population, contribution to the Organization’s budget\r\nand contribution to international peace and security. This\r\ndelegation therefore proposes that the threshold for\r\nindefinite membership should be a population of 100\r\nmillion. To the population threshold should be added the\r\ncriterion of contribution to the Organization’s budget. This\r\ndelegation proposes that the minimum contribution\r\nthreshold should be 5 percent. In this connection, we refer\r\nto the British proposals on assessment currently being\r\ninformally discussed. A higher assessment of an additional,\r\nfor example, 2 percent over the initial 5 percent would\r\ncompensate for a population deficit of between 10 and 40\r\nmillion.\r\nFinally, countries with populations in excess of 800\r\nmillion would automatically be indefinite members without\r\nhaving to satisfy additional criteria.\r\nThe chief criterion for regular Council membership\r\nwould be membership of the United Nations. Such seats\r\nwould be allocated on a strictly equitable geographical\r\nbasis, utilizing the Organization’s continental regions, and\r\notherwise on the basis of Article 23 of the Charter, as at\r\npresent written.\r\nIt is further proposed that a State that fails to satisfy\r\nthe population threshold for indefinite membership might,\r\nby agreement, combine with one or more adjacent States\r\nas a composite or constituency indefinite member.\r\nAdjacency would include strategic adjacency across a\r\nbody of water, no matter how large. This delegation\r\nwould like to stress that under this modality, the right to\r\nvote and the exercise of the veto would be rotated,\r\npossibly at intervals of one to three months.\r\nThe composite modality is clearly a form of\r\nconstituency association, which is becoming relatively\r\npopular in organizations and agencies that provide\r\nspecific benefits or have defined and tangible functions.\r\nIt should therefore work well in the Security Council.\r\nIt would work particularly well in connection with\r\nregular membership. In this context it would dramatically\r\nimprove the opportunities of many scores of developing\r\ncountries which, as demonstrated by a survey referred to\r\nby the delegation of Italy, have never been members of\r\nthe Council. Furthermore, the composite or constituency\r\nmodality would encourage effective regionalism and the\r\nestablishment of regional arrangements or agencies under\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter, since membership in such\r\narrangements or agencies as are approved by the Council\r\ncould be deemed to satisfy the adjacency criterion. This\r\nproposal would go far towards de-emphasizing the elitism\r\nthat is now endemic in the Council.\r\nThe composite or constituency notion might be\r\nregarded as novel. In fact, the very essence of the\r\nconcept of security ushered in by the Second World War\r\nand the Charter is its shared nature. This is underscored\r\nby Chapter VIII and by the main institutions of Chapter\r\nVII, including collective self-defence. Current trends in\r\npeace-keeping, peacemaking and humanitarian assistance\r\nwould appear to confirm this point. Therefore, the Belize\r\nproposals, while giving full scope to the present,\r\nsomewhat arbitrary, continental regions, also emphasize\r\na variety of types of genuine security regions.\r\nIt is proposed that the maximum number of seats in\r\nthe Council would be approximately 23. Of these, there\r\nwould be a maximum of 9 indefinite members and a\r\nminimum of 14 regular members. Since, in both\r\ncategories, a composite or constituency group of two or\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nmore States would count as one member, the actual number\r\nof participating States could be considerably larger than 23.\r\nWhatever the surface details of my delegation’s\r\nproposals, it may be that these ideas are as simple as one\r\ncan expect proposals on the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity to be in our twenty-first-century world of diverse\r\nregions, cultures and economic and social realities.\r\nMr. Somavia (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/62, adopted late in 1992,\r\nwhich requested the Secretary-General to invite Member\r\nStates to submit written comments on a possible review of\r\nthe membership of the Security Council, clearly indicated\r\nthe vital importance of this agenda item, not only for the\r\nCouncil itself but for the future of the United Nations as a\r\nwhole.\r\nWe are therefore not surprised at the considerable\r\ninterest that has been awakened by the discussion on the\r\nsubject that has been held over the past two years, one\r\nmarked by a wide participation that has been highly\r\ninstructive. That interest has been evident in the many\r\nwritten replies received by the Secretary-General in keeping\r\nwith the aforementioned resolution and, particularly, in the\r\nGeneral Assembly Working Group so effectively and\r\nseriously guided by Ambassador Samuel Insanally, with the\r\ninvaluable assistance of the two Vice-Chairmen, the\r\nPermanent Representatives of Finland, Ambassador\r\nWilhelm Breitenstein, and of Singapore, Ambassador Chew\r\nTai Soo, whom I congratulate for their excellent work.\r\nSimilarly, the enormous importance Member States\r\nattach to this subject has been demonstrated in the general\r\ndebates of the last two sessions of the Assembly, in 1993\r\nand this year, during the course of which nearly every Head\r\nof State and Minister for Foreign Affairs made reference to\r\nthe item. There can be no doubt that a clear consensus\r\nexists among Members of the United Nations on the need\r\nand urgency to proceed to reform the structures and\r\nprocedures of the Security Council.\r\nWhile the report on the progress made by the Working\r\nGroup has been factual in nature where we might have\r\nhoped to see it reflect some progress on substantive\r\nquestions, we believe that debate within that Group has\r\nbeen as useful as it has been necessary.\r\nThe open, frank and constructive participation of so\r\nmany delegations expressing often very different positions\r\nis, in our opinion, an unavoidable phase through which we\r\nmust pass if we wish to achieve a broad and solid political\r\nagreement that will fully reflect the majority will of\r\nMember States.\r\nThus, we must not curb this impetus but must\r\nincrease our efforts to achieve, within a reasonable period\r\nof time, a consensus on the substantive issues under\r\ndiscussion.\r\nMy delegation has always felt that we must\r\nconstantly bear in mind the fact that the restructuring of\r\nthe Security Council must be especially aimed at\r\nstrengthening its effectiveness, its representativeness and\r\nthe legitimacy of its task, and at making the Council more\r\ndemocratic, to enable it better to meet present and future\r\nchallenges. We believe that the Council, by carrying out\r\nits principal task of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity, will help build the safer and more humane world\r\nto which we all aspire.\r\nWe are also convinced that those concepts, which\r\nare closely linked, are related to a creative and standing\r\nrelationship between the Council and the General\r\nAssembly and other organs and organizations, as well as\r\nwith States that are not members of the Council, and\r\nrelated also to the reform of the working methods and\r\nprocedures of the Council. This is especially needed\r\nwhen it comes to countries involved in peace-keeping\r\noperations, which have legitimate interests and whose\r\nproposals must be heard.\r\nSimilarly, Chile’s delegation deems it especially\r\nimportant for reform to lead to greater transparency in\r\ndecision-making, something that is indispensable if we\r\nwant to enhance the Council’s legitimacy and credibility.\r\nWe also believe that all States Members must agree to\r\ncomply with its mandates as provided for by the Charter.\r\nThe Government of Chile has welcomed the progress\r\ntowards greater transparency in the Council’s practices\r\nand procedures that do not require changes in the Charter.\r\nWe view this as a first step in the right direction.\r\nA balanced increase in the number of members of\r\nthe Security Council has become a necessity in today’s\r\ninternational climate. In our view, that increase must\r\nreflect the current number of States Members of the\r\nOrganization and the reality of the new international\r\nscene in all its aspects, as well as equitable representation\r\nfor all existing regional groups.\r\nWe agree with the general view that has emerged\r\nfrom the discussions of the Working Group that the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nadjustment in the Council’s membership should not exceed\r\n24 or 25, so as the better to reflect present-day realities.\r\nWhile it is of special importance to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the Council’s work, we believe that that\r\nshould not become a pretext for inhibiting the expansion of\r\nits membership.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nBecause of the importance my delegation attaches to\r\nthe need for greater democratization and balance in the\r\nCouncil’s composition and decision-making mechanism, we\r\nhave proposed, inter alia, the establishment of a category\r\nof regional members with an extended mandate. A new\r\ncategory of this kind would give countries in the main\r\nregions of the developed world - as regional representatives\r\nor representatives with an extended mandate - a say in the\r\nCouncil’s decisions, without the right of veto, and with the\r\npossibility of re-election.\r\nWe have also said that we favour the establishment of\r\na category of permanent member without the right of veto.\r\nThis would enable countries with the necessary economic\r\nand political capacity to contribute to the work of the\r\nCouncil. We repeat that we are not proponents of an\r\nextension of the right of veto. We welcome the fact that\r\nthe veto has been used less in recent years, and we look\r\nforward to the devising of formulas to avoid its use in the\r\nfuture.\r\nAs regards categories, we have considered the\r\nretention of the category of non-permanent member without\r\nthe possibility of re-election; the criteria for their election\r\nare contained in Article 23 of the Charter, but we must bear\r\nin mind that this Article refers also to equitable\r\ngeographical distribution.\r\nThe Security Council cannot be designed to take\r\naccount of the strategic needs or privileges of just some\r\nStates. It must faithfully meet the criteria of wide\r\nrepresentativeness if it is to enhance the international\r\ncommunity’s unequivocal and universal support for all its\r\nresolutions and decisions. At stake here is not just the\r\nreform per se of an organ of the system but the very\r\ncredibility and prestige of the United Nations itself.\r\nThe Government of Chile, aware that this item will\r\npose major challenges and involve major responsibilities,\r\naspires to a seat on the Security Council for the period\r\n1996 and 1997 with a view to contributing to the new spirit\r\nof cooperation in international relations. As the Foreign\r\nMinister of Chile pointed out at this rostrum a few days\r\nago, we are convinced that we can legitimately and\r\nproperly represent the interests of Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean, and indeed of the international community, in\r\nthis important organ.\r\nWe should like to express our satisfaction at the\r\nopen-mindedness and the active participation that have so\r\nfar been demonstrated in the treatment of this very\r\ncomplex item. We hope that we shall soon see the\r\nconsensus necessary to achieving progress in respect of\r\nthe substantive aspects of our debate. Thus we support\r\nJapan’s suggestion that the Assembly give swift approval\r\nto a package of specific proposals. To this end, we call\r\nupon all delegations to act with flexibility and pragmatism\r\nin the negotiations that are to begin, so that we may soon\r\nhave a restructured Security Council better able to meet\r\nthe urgent requirements of our times.\r\nMr. Pálsson (Iceland): I have the honour of\r\nspeaking on behalf of the five Nordic countries -\r\nDenmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden - in\r\naddressing the question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council.\r\nI should like, first of all, to take this opportunity to\r\nthank the President of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session, Ambassador Samuel Insanally, for his wise\r\nleadership of the Open-ended Working Group.\r\nStatements by Foreign Ministers and other\r\nrepresentatives of the Nordic countries who participated\r\nin the general debate of the General Assembly’s current\r\nsession attest to the importance the Nordic countries\r\ncontinue to attach to this issue. May I refer also to the\r\njoint Nordic position paper that was presented in the\r\nWorking Group last June. This paper covered, in a\r\npreliminary way, most of the questions under discussion.\r\nIts aim was, first and foremost, to contribute to the\r\nongoing debate and, in so doing, to facilitate the building\r\nof the widest possible support for what the Nordic\r\ncountries regard as necessary reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We stand ready to develop further the thoughts\r\ncontained in the paper, in cooperation with other\r\ninterested delegations.\r\nWhile I do not wish to recapitulate the paper’s main\r\npoints, which remain valid, I should like to use this\r\nopportunity to reiterate the Nordic countries’ strong\r\nsupport for limited expansion of Council membership.\r\nThis would strengthen the Council’s ability to act rapidly\r\nand effectively, while reflecting the growing number of\r\nStates Members of the Organization. Furthermore,\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nparticular importance should be given to the question of\r\nadditional seats for non-permanent members, taking into\r\naccount the principle of equitable geographical distribution.\r\nIt is also the view of the Nordic countries that only a\r\nlimited number of new seats should be designated as\r\npermanent.\r\nSince June the Working Group has submitted a report\r\nto the General Assembly. The Nordic countries welcome\r\nthe report and appreciate the Group’s dedicated efforts in\r\nharmonizing the different views that were put forward. At\r\nthe same time, it is clear that the complex questions that the\r\nWorking Group has been called upon to deal with require\r\nfurther study and reflection. I should like to reiterate the\r\nNordic countries’ keen interest in pursuing this matter\r\nfurther.\r\nIn the general debate several countries presented a\r\nnumber of ideas and thoughts on how to take the issue\r\nforward. In the view of the Nordic countries, time is now\r\nneeded to contemplate the various new ideas. However,\r\nthis does not mean that the matter should be allowed to\r\nlapse. We believe that consultations with all interested\r\ndelegations should take place during the main part of the\r\nGeneral Assembly session. A realistic and regular schedule\r\nof meetings of the Open-ended Working Group should be\r\narranged for that purpose. Such meetings could be\r\nsupplemented, as appropriate, by smaller, informal group\r\ndiscussions on specific issues.\r\nWhatever the form, the Nordic countries consider it\r\nimportant that this work be continued with a view to\r\narriving, in due course, at a conclusion acceptable to all.\r\nMr. Inderfurth (United States of America): Let me\r\nbegin, Sir, by repeating President Clinton’s congratulations\r\nto you on your recent election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. The United\r\nStates is pleased to see you in the Chair, and we look\r\nforward to working with you to ensure a successful session.\r\nI should like also to express our thanks to your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Insanally, for his leadership of the\r\nGeneral Assembly during its forty-eighth session. We are\r\ngrateful for his efforts in his capacity as President of the\r\nAssembly and for his work as Chairman, together with his\r\nVice-Chairmen, the Ambassadors of Finland and of\r\nSingapore, in guiding and assisting the Working Group on\r\nthe Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council.\r\nFrom our perspective, the debate in the Working\r\nGroup was highly constructive. While no conclusions\r\nwere drawn, as noted in the progress report, there was a\r\nconvergence of views that the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil should be enlarged. Of course, differences\r\nremain over how best to achieve an expansion, but this is\r\nto be expected on an issue of such high national interest\r\nto so many. Moreover, in our judgement, the debate gave\r\nrise to several broadly supported principles that could\r\nguide future efforts as we seek final agreement.\r\nSeveral of these principles were reiterated by our\r\ncolleagues during the general debate just concluded. Let\r\nme summarize them. First, as the statements of\r\nArgentina, Austria and Poland rightly stressed, the test of\r\nacceptability of any decision to expand the Council must\r\nbe that it broadens participation while safeguarding\r\noperational efficiency and effectiveness. Secondly, the\r\nNetherlands, Costa Rica, Indonesia and others have\r\nreminded us that a country’s specific strengths - its\r\ncapacity for constructive global influence and to\r\nundertake and sustain heavy global responsibilities - are\r\na critical test of eligibility for permanent membership.\r\nFinally, Kenya, Canada, New Zealand, Spain and many\r\nothers have emphasized that the goal of a stronger, more\r\neffective Security Council, clearly served by a careful\r\nexpansion, also requires greater transparency and\r\nopenness in Council procedures.\r\nIf we take these principles to be our compass, we\r\ncannot fail to see our course clearly. Indeed, the views\r\nof the United States are precisely along these lines. First,\r\nwe welcome changes to the Council’s composition that\r\nenhance its representativeness while protecting its\r\neffectiveness and efficiency. Secondly, the existing\r\npermanent members of the Security Council are countries\r\nwith global political and economic influence and a\r\ncapacity to contribute to peace and security by concrete\r\nmeasures on a global basis. Thirdly, guided by the\r\ncriteria just noted, we enthusiastically endorse Japan and\r\nGermany for permanent membership. Fourthly, we also\r\nsee the need for an increase in non-permanent seats,\r\nnamely, an addition of three seats for a total Council\r\nmembership of 20. Fifthly, in order to give Member\r\nStates greater influence over the selection of non-\r\npermanent Council members without restricting the\r\nopportunity of small countries to serve as Council\r\nmembers, we favour exempting non-permanent seats from\r\nthe prohibition of re-election. Finally, the Security\r\nCouncil is actively pursuing means by which non-\r\nmembers may contribute to its work. The United States\r\nis directly engaged in this effort, which has already\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nproduced valuable results, and we believe that it must\r\ncontinue.\r\nOur pursuit of a stronger Council reflects our\r\nconclusion that, to meet the challenges increasingly\r\nentrusted to its care, the Council will require a broader and\r\ndeeper partnership - a partnership to lead collective efforts\r\nand to share the many and varied burdens. This has three\r\nimplications for today’s Security Council.\r\nFirst, it means that the nucleus of capabilities\r\nrepresented by the permanent members should be expanded.\r\nThe addition of Japan and Germany will join the energies,\r\ntalents and resources of these enormously capable countries\r\nto the task of safeguarding our common security. Indeed,\r\nJapan and Germany have shown themselves eager and well-\r\nequipped to act in newly critical areas such as peace-\r\nbuilding and conflict prevention.\r\nSecondly, an enhanced partnership means two things\r\nfor the non-permanent seats. They ought to be increased in\r\nnumber without damaging Council decision-making and the\r\nrotation of countries in those seats should assure that the\r\nCouncil can benefit from the participation of those\r\ncountries, including small States, with a record of\r\nconstructive involvement in United Nations peace and\r\nsecurity efforts.\r\nLastly, to build a deeper, broader partnership requires\r\nthat the Security Council move firmly to establish strong,\r\nsustainable working relationships with those non-members,\r\nsuch as troop contributors, whose continued support is\r\nessential to the success of Council members and mandates.\r\nOn the latter point, we want to emphasize that important\r\nsteps have already been taken to improve the flow of\r\ninformation about Council decisions and to provide\r\noccasion for troop contributors to offer views on matters\r\npertinent to Council decisions on peace-keeping mandates.\r\nOne example is a growing participation by Security Council\r\nmembers in troop-contributor meetings. This practice has\r\nenabled troop contributors concerned about some aspect of\r\na proposed mandate change to inform Council members\r\ndirectly of their views. Indeed, in one instance it provided\r\nfor direct exchanges on the elements of a proposed\r\nresolution.\r\nA number of additional steps might be explored. One\r\npossibility is for Council members to make more regular\r\nuse of selected troop-contributor meetings to invite\r\ncomment on resolution elements concerning changes in\r\npeace-keeping mandates. While such meetings will still be\r\nchaired by the Secretariat, the role of the Secretariat in such\r\ncases could be to provide a venue for direct exchanges\r\nbetween Council members and troop contributors.\r\nThe United States is committed to exploring ways to\r\nstrengthen working relations with troop contributors, and\r\nmore openness and transparency are certainly possible.\r\nBut I should caution that, in decision making,\r\ntransparency is a good servant but a poor master. Too\r\nmuch will inhibit frank discussion and drive it away from\r\nthe Council’s chambers to settings in which privacy can\r\nbe assured. That would not serve anyone’s interests.\r\nIn closing, let me make a few points about process.\r\nFirst, over the course of the general debate, some\r\nspeakers have urged their colleagues to delay any action\r\non Security Council expansion for several years. They\r\nargue that the world is so unsettled today that it is unwise\r\nto enter into structural changes to the Security Council\r\nwhich are intended to be lasting. For the United States,\r\nthis is a false choice. The case to strengthen the Council\r\nis compelling precisely because of the mounting tumult of\r\nthe post-cold-war world and the dangers it poses to all of\r\nus, not 10 years from now but today.\r\nSecondly, while the sessions of the Working Group\r\nwere helpful in defining the spread of opinion and\r\nbringing forth the principles I mentioned, they are too\r\nlarge a venue for the frank give-and-take needed to bridge\r\nremaining differences. We therefore urge you, Sir, and\r\nthe Bureau to consider inviting small, informal groups of\r\nMembers to meet with you over the coming months to\r\nexplore areas of common ground and possible formulas\r\nfor reaching agreement on Council expansion. Sessions\r\nof the Working Group could be convened periodically to\r\ntake stock of these discussions and to review the progress\r\nmade.\r\nFinally, as others stated during the general debate,\r\nwe too would like to see an acceleration of deliberations\r\non this subject during the forty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. But in this regard we do not favour\r\na piecemeal approach. Rather, we are hopeful that\r\nagreement may be reached on all elements of an overall\r\npackage by the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work:\r\nreports of the General Committee\r\nSecond report of the General Committee\r\n(A/49/250/Add.1)\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 13 October 1994\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I draw\r\nthe attention of representatives to the second report of the\r\nGeneral Committee concerning the allocation of agenda\r\nitems 152 and 92, two requests for the reconsideration of\r\nthe allocation of sub-items (d) and (e) of agenda item 89,\r\nand a request by the delegation of Afghanistan for the\r\ninclusion in the agenda of an additional sub-item.\r\nIn paragraph 1 of the report, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the Assembly that item 152 of the agenda,\r\nentitled \"Observer status for the International Federation of\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies in the General\r\nAssembly\", be considered directly in plenary meeting, on\r\nthe understanding that no further question beyond items 151\r\n- \"Observer status for the South Pacific Forum in the\r\nGeneral Assembly\" -
