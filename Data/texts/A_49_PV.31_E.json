(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 112 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/49/400/Add.3)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In a\r\nletter contained in document A/49/400/Add.3 the Secretary-\r\nGeneral informs me that, since the issuance of his\r\ncommunications dated 20 and 26 September and 5 October\r\n1994, Guatemala has made the necessary payment to reduce\r\nits arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 33 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters\r\nMr. Marker (Pakistan): Pakistan has actively\r\nparticipated in the constructive consultations held by the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. I would again wish to express our deep\r\nappreciation for the able manner in which Mr. Insanally,\r\nthe preceding President of the General Assembly, and the\r\ntwo Vice-Chairmen, Mr. Chew Tai Soo of Singapore and\r\nMr. Wilhelm Breitenstein of Finland, guided the work of\r\nthe Group.\r\nDespite the extensive consultations held on this\r\nissue, the gap between the divergent views held by\r\nvarious delegations was not bridged. Thus, the Group’s\r\ndeliberations could not culminate in concrete conclusions\r\nand recommendations. As is noted in the Working\r\nGroup’s report and the Secretary-General’s annual report\r\non the Work of the Organization, this subject is open for\r\nfurther discussion.\r\nIn any review of this issue, the proposed reform and\r\nenlargement of the Security Council has to be understood\r\nin its proper historical context and perspective. In the\r\naftermath of the tragic devastation caused by the Second\r\nWorld War, the United Nations was created “to save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war”. The\r\nSecurity Council was conceived as the principal organ for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. The\r\npresumption was that five permanent members, allies\r\nduring the war, would continue to act in harmony. This\r\nassumption proved incorrect once the world became\r\npolarized during the prolonged cold war. During that\r\nperiod, the Council was unable to reach decisions on any\r\nissue that invoked the rival interests of the two super-\r\nPower blocs. Most conflicts were settled not by the\r\nCouncil but by the major Powers outside the Council.\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nAt the end of the cold war, and after the experience of\r\nthe Gulf War, hopes were revived that a more confident,\r\neffective and strengthened Security Council could emerge\r\nas an important deterrent to aggression, and where\r\naggression occurred, as an instrument to reverse it.\r\nHowever, subsequent experience has tempered these hopes\r\nand expectations. The failure of the Council to implement\r\nits resolutions on Bosnia and Herzegovina, its inadequate\r\nresponse to events in Rwanda, its inability to implement its\r\nresolutions on Jammu and Kashmir have all contributed to\r\na sense of insecurity. Instead of a new world order,\r\nsupervised by the Security Council, we are confronted with\r\na series of disputes and conflicts across Africa and Euro-\r\nAsia.\r\nIt is in this context, and with a full appreciation of the\r\nSecurity Council’s strengths and limitations, that we should\r\nseek to promote ways and means to make it more effective\r\nin preserving international peace and security. The Security\r\nCouncil has in-built inequities. It is composed of a very\r\nsmall number of Member States. It is divided between\r\npermanent and non-permanent members, those with the veto\r\nand those without.\r\nThe purpose of our present exercise should be to\r\npromote greater democracy and transparency in the work of\r\nthe Council. Our aim should be to enhance the effectiveness\r\nand efficiency of the Council in accordance with Article 24,\r\nparagraph 1, of the Charter. We must avoid any attempt to\r\nperpetuate and accentuate the existing inequalities by\r\ncreating new centres of privilege. Our endeavour must be\r\nto strengthen, not erode, the principle of the sovereign\r\nequality of States enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe general membership of the United Nations has\r\nincreased from 51 in 1945 to 184 in 1994. We therefore\r\nshare the general desire of Member States to strengthen the\r\nrole of the Council, as well as to review its composition to\r\nreflect adequately the increase in its membership,\r\nparticularly of the larger number of small and medium-\r\nsized States that have joined the United Nations.\r\nThe Council’s current composition lacks balance in\r\nterms of geographic distribution. However, any attempt to\r\nprovide greater representation to various regions should\r\nreflect the circumstances existing within each region. The\r\narguments for equitable regional representation must be\r\nviewed in the context of the legitimate concerns of all\r\nMember States within the region concerned. The\r\naccommodation of regional representation should not fuel\r\ntendencies towards hegemony and domination which are\r\nmanifest in some regions. Again, our approach must\r\nuphold the sovereign equality of States, large or small.\r\nWe must bear in mind that this item was originally\r\ninscribed to consider an increase in the non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council. We should not allow\r\nthe present consultations to be taken over to accommodate\r\nthe objectives of only a few countries. An increase in the\r\npermanent membership of the Council, instead of\r\nenhancing the Council’s effectiveness, would serve only\r\nto alienate the small and medium-sized countries that\r\nconstitute a majority in the General Assembly.\r\nSome concepts for creating new categories, such as\r\nregional or semi-permanent members, have been\r\nintroduced. They need further discussion and intensive\r\nconsultations. The criteria for non-permanent membership,\r\nin addition to those contained in Article 23 of the Charter,\r\nrequire to be more seriously applied. These criteria clearly\r\nimply that, in accordance with Articles 24 and 25,\r\nMember States represented in the Council must be willing\r\nto act on behalf of all United Nations Member States in\r\na prompt and effective manner and, more important, that\r\nthey will consistently implement the decisions of the\r\nCouncil. Those States that continue to flout the principles\r\nof the Charter and to defy the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil cannot aspire to serve as the guardians of peace\r\non the Security Council.\r\nObviously, the size of a reformed Security Council\r\nwould be central to the reform package. The Council\r\nshould be kept small enough to guarantee efficiency and\r\neffectiveness, but it should be large enough to ensure\r\nadequate representation of the small and medium-sized\r\nStates. However, in addition to the size of the Council\r\nthere are other aspects that need equal attention in the\r\nreform process.\r\nAny meaningful review of the functioning of the\r\nCouncil should encompass the broader and vital issues of\r\ndemocratization and transparency in the decision-making\r\nprocess. During the consultations held by the Working\r\nGroup, many proposals have been put forward which can\r\nfacilitate the involvement of the general membership in\r\nthe Council’s decision-making process.\r\nDemocratization can be achieved by redefining the\r\nCouncil’s relationship with the General Assembly and\r\nwith other United Nations bodies. A fresh look should be\r\ngiven to Articles 11, 12 and 24 of the Charter, with a\r\nview to evolving a joint working relationship between the\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly in the maintenance of\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\ninternational peace and security. An effective mechanism\r\ncan be established to convey to the Council the General\r\nAssembly’s views and recommendations on peace and\r\nsecurity as a means of enhancing the participation of the\r\ngeneral membership of our Organization in the Council’s\r\ndecision-making process. Instead of the present practice of\r\na pro-forma discussion of the Council’s annual report, the\r\nGeneral Assembly should discuss it more substantively and\r\ncritically, in accordance with Articles 11, 14 and 35 of the\r\nCharter. A working group of the Assembly could be created\r\nto analyse the Council’s report before its consideration in\r\nthe plenary Assembly.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group could also examine\r\nthe possibility of creating a subsidiary organ of the General\r\nAssembly under Article 22 which could consider and\r\ndiscuss questions related to international peace and security\r\nthat might be brought before it by a Member of the United\r\nNations or of the Security Council, as provided in the\r\nCharter. In addition, the Presidents of the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly should meet regularly to\r\ncoordinate the work of the two bodies.\r\nThe linkage between economic and social problems\r\nand political upheavals in various parts of the world is all\r\ntoo obvious. There is an urgent need to strengthen the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the Economic\r\nand Social Council, so that economic and social factors are\r\naccorded their due weight in decisions relating to\r\ninternational peace and security. There is legitimate reason\r\nto fear that the economic crises of today — debt,\r\ndesertification, decline in commodity prices — could lead\r\nto the political conflicts of tomorrow within and among\r\nStates. The Economic and Social Council could serve, in\r\nmany cases, to provide the Security Council an early\r\nwarning of impending upheavals and conflicts.\r\nThe onus for promoting greater transparency is on the\r\nSecurity Council. We are happy to note that during the last\r\nyear the Council has taken many positive steps to enhance\r\nits relationship with the General Assembly. However, more\r\nconcrete steps are required for closer consultation with\r\nUnited Nations Members, particularly the troop-contributing\r\ncountries, in pursuance of Article 44. The President of the\r\nSecurity Council should provide regular and substantive\r\nbriefings to the general membership on the major issues\r\nbefore the Council. A subsidiary organ of the Council could\r\nbe established, under Article 29, to monitor the peace-\r\nkeeping operations and to institutionalize a system of direct\r\nconsultations with troop-contributing countries during the\r\nprocess of making decisions regarding such operations.\r\nWe fully support the position taken on this issue by\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement at its summit in Jakarta in\r\n1992, and at the ministerial meeting in Cairo last June.\r\nIt is of fundamental importance that the outcome of\r\nour efforts be in strict conformity with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. It must be\r\nbased on consensus and agreement among Member States.\r\nA decision on this question that lacks the support of the\r\ngeneral United Nations membership will be\r\ncounterproductive. It could erode general support for the\r\nfuture role of the Security Council and cast doubt on the\r\nsanctity of its decisions.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to offer a few comments\r\non the pace of work of the Open-ended Working Group.\r\nThe last reform of the Council took years to mature,\r\nalthough it addressed only one question: an increase in\r\nthe non-permanent membership. It takes time to muster\r\nbroad support for Charter amendments. Today, we are\r\nembarking on a comprehensive reform of the Council,\r\nincluding its enlargement.\r\nPakistan will work patiently and diligently with other\r\nUnited Nations Members to evolve a decision on the\r\nreform of the Security Council that advances the cause of\r\npeace, security and the aims and objectives of the Charter.\r\nWe have to be patient in this important exercise without\r\nbeing tardy.\r\nMr. Gomersall (United Kingdom): Mr. President,\r\nmay I first add my congratulations to you on the\r\nassumption of your high office.\r\nThe general debate of the General Assembly has\r\nreaffirmed, if reaffirmation were needed, the importance\r\nthat Member States of this Organization accord to the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council. A representative and\r\neffective Security Council is clearly in the interests of all.\r\nMy delegation believes that there has been genuine\r\nprogress over the last year in increasing common\r\nunderstanding of the issues, and that we have now\r\nreached the stage where we should be able to move\r\nbeyond the delivery of prepared statements and begin to\r\nlook at ways of resolving the important outstanding\r\nquestions in a substantive way. My Government’s position\r\non most aspects of the enlargement question has already\r\nbeen set out in detail in the Open-ended Working Group.\r\nBut it is probably worth recalling our view that any\r\nenlargement of the Council should be relatively limited,\r\nto around 19 or 20 members, so that the Council’s\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\neffectiveness is not jeopardized; and that if consensus can\r\nbe reached certain countries, by virtue of their global\r\ninterests and their contribution to international security and\r\nto United Nations operations, should be invited to accept\r\nthe responsibilities of permanent membership. In that\r\ncontext, we would support the permanent membership of\r\nJapan and Germany.\r\nConcerning “Other related matters”, the Security\r\nCouncil, through the work of its informal Working Group\r\nconcerning the Council’s documentation and other\r\nprocedural questions, has taken a number of steps over the\r\nlast year to increase the transparency of Council activities.\r\nPriority has also been given to efforts to enhance\r\narrangements for consultation of troop contributors. My\r\nGovernment supports the proposal that the Secretariat\r\nshould, as a matter of course, convene meetings with troop\r\ncontributors and members of the Council for the exchange\r\nof information and views in good time in advance of\r\ndecisions by the Council on the extension or termination of,\r\nor significant change in, the mandate of peace-keeping\r\noperations. These issues will no doubt be further discussed\r\nduring the debate on the report of the Council to the\r\nAssembly on 26 October. But I would like to reaffirm my\r\ndelegation’s commitment to continuing to support the\r\nCouncil’s efforts to enhance transparency, while doing\r\nnothing that would damage its efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nAlthough the task before the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup remains a difficult and sensitive one, we were glad\r\nto note that there was some convergence of views in the\r\ncourse of its work this year on the nature of the\r\nenlargement that might be achieved. We must maintain the\r\nmomentum of this work in the weeks and months ahead,\r\nsupplemented, where possible, by informal consultations to\r\nseek out areas of possible agreement. Next year’s fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations will be a significant\r\nmilestone in our debate. My delegation will work with\r\nothers to achieve, if possible, a positive outcome on this\r\nmost important question.\r\nMr. Noterdaeme (Belgium) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): On 14 September last, the General Assembly took\r\nnote of the report (A/48/47) of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup, which was instructed, in pursuance of resolution\r\n48/26, to consider all aspects of the question of increase of\r\nthe membership of the Security Council, and other matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council. This report illustrates the\r\ndivergences that persist regarding various aspects of reform\r\nof the Security Council, whose complexity and sensitive\r\nnature are clear to all.\r\nThe General Assembly decided that the Working\r\nGroup should continue its consultations during the forty-\r\nninth session and submit a further report before the end\r\nof the session. As in the past, Belgium will participate in\r\nthose consultations actively and in a spirit of consensus.\r\nI want to take this opportunity to recall the main\r\nlines of Belgium’s thinking on reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Belgium considers that Security Council reform\r\nshould not betray the spirit of the provisions of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations that specify the\r\ncomposition and mandate of this principal organ of the\r\nUnited Nations. The maintenance of international peace\r\nand security is one of the main purposes of the Charter to\r\nwhich Belgium attaches paramount importance.\r\nThe current system of collective security controlled\r\nby the Security Council is imperfect to be sure. But it has\r\nthe merit of being the only universal tool for conflict\r\nmanagement. In view of the continuing threat of crisis\r\nfacing the international community, the Security Council’s\r\neffectiveness and capacity for action must be preserved.\r\nFor Belgium, therefore, the present debate on reform of\r\nthe Security Council should always be directed at\r\nstrengthening the Council’s action for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. While the faults and\r\nshortcomings of the system should be eliminated to the\r\nextent possible, we should not forget that the main\r\npurpose of this exercise is the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nPast, present and, no doubt, future imperfections in\r\nthe collective-security system oblige us to lower our\r\nsights somewhat. Belgium is convinced that the best basis\r\nfor reforming the Security Council is pragmatism, not\r\nprejudgements and highly detailed theorizing. Like the\r\nUnited Nations itself, the Council is but a reflection of the\r\nrelations among States Members of the Organization.\r\nRecent developments in those relations make it imperative\r\nthat the Council be adapted to the new challenges before\r\nit. But we would certainly risk failure if we tried to use\r\nthis need for legitimate change to launch a real revolution,\r\nwhich would be unrealistic given the difficulty of\r\nattaining its objectives.\r\nThat is the conceptual approach that Belgium thinks\r\nshould guide future work on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil; on the basis of that approach let me outline\r\nsome of the practical outcomes of such reform.\r\nFirst of all, if it is the view that the recent growth in\r\nthe membership of the United Nations must be reflected\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nin increased membership of the Security Council, Belgium\r\ncontinues to favour a limited increase. We consider that an\r\nincrease of from two to five additional members would\r\nseem most appropriate to respond both to the Council’s\r\nneed for effectiveness and to the need for better\r\nrepresentativity.\r\nSecondly, as my Minister for Foreign Affairs said\r\nrecently in this Hall, the international community would do\r\nwell to grant permanent membership to two economic\r\nPowers whose positive role in world affairs has long been\r\nrecognized. As the Secretary-General observed in his most\r\nrecent report on the work of the Organization, economic\r\nand social development contribute to strengthening the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Hence,\r\nsurely it is reasonable to give a special place on the Council\r\nto those who are in a position to support such economic\r\nand social development, on the same conditions as those\r\napplying to the five present permanent members. Moreover,\r\nan additional non-permanent seat should be granted to the\r\nregions that consider themselves under-represented.\r\nThirdly, the distinction between permanent and non-\r\npermanent members should remain unchanged. It is an\r\nestablished state of affairs that is accepted by all. To try to\r\nmodify it by creating a new category of membership would\r\nspark an unpredictable debate on determining the new\r\ncriteria.\r\nFourthly, the Working Group’s experience shows the\r\ndifficulty of achieving concurrent consensus on all aspects\r\nof Security Council reform. While we recognize that all the\r\naspects of this reform are equally valuable, perhaps we\r\ncould gradually identify those on which consensus is in\r\nsight while also continuing our efforts to narrow the\r\nremaining differences on other aspects.\r\nIt was my purpose today to reiterate Belgium’s interest\r\nin the question of reform of the Security Council. With\r\nfurther Working Group consultations in view, I wanted to\r\nrecall our conceptual approach and some of its practical\r\nresults. For Belgium, realism continues to be the most\r\nreasonable approach if we want to achieve reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, and particularly if we want to retain some\r\ninfluence on the ongoing process. For some, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations could be the setting for\r\nSecurity Council reform. Certainly, Belgium would favour\r\nreform of the Security Council coinciding, if possible, with\r\nthe marking of the Organization’s half century.\r\nMr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): The Chinese delegation welcomes the continued\r\nconsideration at the current session of the General\r\nAssembly of the question of equitable representation on\r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council.\r\nHere, we would also like to welcome the first report\r\nsubmitted by the Open-ended Working Group set up in\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 48/26. We\r\nappreciate the large amount of work the Working Group\r\nhas managed to accomplish under the guidance of His\r\nExcellency Mr. Samuel R. Insanally, President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session, and of the\r\ntwo Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group, the Permanent\r\nRepresentatives of Finland and Singapore.\r\nChina is in favour of Security Council reform. In our\r\nview, necessary reform of the Security Council must be\r\ncarried out because of the need to adapt the Council to\r\nthe changed world situation and to meet the grave\r\nchallenges before us. The Chinese delegation is of the\r\nview that appropriate expansion of the Security Council\r\nand needed improvement of its working methods should\r\naim, first of all, at improving the Council’s representation\r\nso that it will better reflect the collective will and\r\ncommon aspiration of the States Members of the United\r\nNations, and secondly, at enhancing the Council’s\r\neffectiveness and efficiency so as to maintain and\r\nstrengthen its positive role in world affairs in the new\r\nsituation and to enable it to perform more effectively the\r\nvarious tasks mandated by the United Nations Charter. All\r\nreform measures should be conducive to the realization of\r\nthose objectives.\r\nReform of the Security Council involves the interest\r\nof all States Members of the United Nations and is an\r\nissue of concern and importance to all countries. Any\r\nreform measures should reflect the interest of every\r\nMember State. In this regard, we are of the view that in\r\nany expansion of the Council, the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution should be observed and full\r\nconsideration should be given to the aspirations and\r\ninterests of developing countries, which account for the\r\nmajority of the United Nations membership, so as to\r\nenable those countries to play a more active role in\r\nUnited Nations affairs. Practices which might lead to the\r\ncreation of any new imbalances should be avoided. At the\r\nsame time, we also believe that all aspects of the question\r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Council are interrelated and should be\r\ndealt with as a whole package in a balanced manner.\r\nEver since the establishment of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group, the question of equitable representation\r\non and increase in the membership of the Security\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nCouncil has remained an issue to which all countries attach\r\ngreat importance. Many countries participated actively in\r\nthe deliberations and put forward a series of specific\r\nproposals. At the same time, broad discussions were also\r\nconducted regarding an increase in transparency of the\r\nCouncil’s work, the improvement of its working methods\r\nas well as the strengthening of the relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly in the\r\nperformance of their respective functions. In our view,\r\nthese discussions are very useful for increasing mutual\r\nunderstanding and reaching consensus among nations.\r\nNaturally, different opinions by various countries also arise\r\nin these discussions on specific aspects of the reform and,\r\nin certain areas, the differences are fairly wide. This shows\r\nthat the task facing us remains arduous and a serious,\r\npractical and patient approach is required to continue the\r\nextensive exchange of views and to seek common ground\r\nstep by step.\r\nThe Chinese delegation hopes that the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group will continue its effective work during the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly and, based on the\r\nprevious discussions, conduct a serious and detailed study\r\non the reasonable and useful suggestions raised by Member\r\nStates so as to formulate, at an early date, a reform\r\nprogramme acceptable to all States Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. Khandogy (Ukraine): The delegation of Ukraine\r\nwould like first of all to express sincere gratitude to\r\nAmbassador Insanally, President of the General Assembly,\r\nat its forty-eighth session, who guided the deliberations of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council. His skilful and\r\nexperienced guidance enabled the Working Group to do a\r\nconsiderable amount of work. We would also like to thank\r\nthe Vice-Chairmen, Ambassador Breitenstein and\r\nAmbassador Chew Tai Soo for their important contribution.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group was, in our opinion,\r\none of the most important forums at the forty-eighth session\r\nof the General Assembly. This can be explained, first of all,\r\nby the importance of the problems discussed and by the\r\nattention Member States paid to its work. During the\r\ndiscussion, a great number of proposals on various aspects\r\nof this question were made. However, special emphasis was\r\nplaced on the problem of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council.\r\nWe feel that the outcome of the discussions is\r\naccurately reflected in the report of the Working Group,\r\nwhich states that:\r\n“While there was a convergence of views that\r\nthe membership of the Security Council should be\r\nenlarged, there was also agreement that the scope\r\nand nature of such enlargement require further\r\ndiscussion.” (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-eighth Session, A/48/47, para. 8)\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine agrees with such a\r\nconclusion. We believed and continue to believe that the\r\ncurrent composition of the Security Council, its\r\nfunctioning and methods of work ought to be adjusted in\r\norder to make the Security Council a more representative\r\nbody taking into account new regional realities and new\r\nparticipants in international relations.\r\nThe enlargement of the membership of the Council,\r\nwhich is a principal organ of the United Nations, acting\r\nin accordance with Charter provisions on behalf of all\r\nMember States, would considerably enhance the\r\ncredibility and legitimacy of its decisions. It is essential,\r\nhowever, to preserve the effectiveness of the Council’s\r\nwork, its capacity to respond without delay to any threat\r\nto peace and security, to consider promptly such situations\r\nand to take necessary decisions based on the Charter.\r\nDiscussions held in the Working Group illustrated\r\nthat to achieve this balance, which would be acceptable to\r\nall regional groups and all Member States, was not an\r\neasy task. There were various proposals concerning the\r\nenlargement of the Council such as to increase the\r\nmembership by only a few States or to bring it up to 30\r\nmembers, and even more. We think that a mutually\r\nacceptable solution should be somewhere in the middle of\r\nthe proposed range. We have already stated in the\r\nWorking Group, and we would like to repeat that, in our\r\nview, the Security Council should consist of 25 States.\r\nSuch an enlargement would make it possible, first, to\r\npreserve the important principle of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation in the Council laid down in Article 24 of\r\nthe Charter and would meet the interests of all — and I\r\nemphasize — all regional groups; and, secondly, it would\r\nnot hamper prompt, effective and resolute actions by the\r\nCouncil, which are required by Article 24 of the Charter.\r\nIn so far as our delegation represents a State that is\r\npart of the Eastern European regional group, I would like\r\nto draw the Assembly’s attention to the following.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nIn 1963, when the first and only reform of the Council\r\nwas undertaken, the Eastern European Group consisted of\r\n10 States and was represented in the Council by one\r\npermanent and one non-permanent member. Today, the\r\nmembership of this group has doubled, but for 20 States we\r\nhave the same number of seats: one permanent and one\r\nnon-permanent — which means that 19 States are\r\ncompeting for one rotating seat. Thus, each State of the\r\nGroup has a chance to be elected to the Council on an\r\naverage once in 38 years. Obviously, such a prospect is not\r\nto be envied. Therefore, we would like to stress, once\r\nagain, that any decision on the question of enlargement of\r\nthe Security Council should take into account the interests\r\nof all regional groups on the basis of the principle of\r\nequitable geographical distribution. Disregarding this\r\nprinciple would make achievement of a consensus\r\nacceptable to all very difficult.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine would also like to stress\r\nthat the enlargement of the Council by 10 seats which we,\r\nas well as a number of other delegations propose, would\r\nmake it possible to accommodate some other formulas put\r\nforward in the Working Group and in the Assembly, in\r\nparticular, the formula “2+3”.\r\nAt the meetings of the Working Group and, indeed, in\r\nthe Assembly, the delegation of Italy and a number of other\r\ndelegations, including Ukraine, proposed consideration of\r\na structure of the Council that would enable some States\r\nthat make considerable contributions to United Nations\r\nactivities to be represented on the Council more often.\r\nWhat was meant was a so-called third category of members\r\nof the Security Council. Some delegations supported this\r\nproposal. However, some other countries either expressed\r\ndoubts about the advisability of the existence of the “third\r\ncategory” or strongly objected to this idea. In this context\r\nwe would like to emphasize that we continue to find it\r\nuseful and worthy of further consideration.\r\nWe are convinced that all United Nations Member\r\nStates would benefit from the establishment of a third\r\ncategory. States which make a greater contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and the achievement of\r\nother goals of the United Nations, and which carry heavy\r\nfinancial obligations, would have a better possibility of\r\nparticipating in the Council’s work, and, thus, paragraph l\r\nof Article 23 of the United Nations Charter would be\r\nimplemented more fully. At the same time, having been\r\nplaced in the third category, these States would not aspire\r\nto the seats subject to the usual rotation in accordance with\r\nparagraph 2 of Article 23. That would allow small States to\r\nbe represented in the Council more often and consequently\r\nto participate more actively in the work of one of the\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations.\r\nThe question of the composition of the Council is\r\norganically linked with the voting procedure. In this\r\ncontext a number of delegations have expressed their\r\nviews on the advisability of a modification of the right to\r\nthe veto. This concept was brought to the United Nations\r\nCharter from the League of Nations but acquired a\r\nsomewhat different shade of meaning in the Organization:\r\nfrom being a tool to maintain a balance between the\r\nsuper-Powers in the period before the Second World War,\r\nit became a mechanism for ideological confrontation\r\nbetween two systems in the post-war period. Through the\r\nreplacement of confrontation by cooperation since the end\r\nof the cold war and the strengthening of the partnership\r\nbetween permanent members of the Security Council, an\r\nopportunity is provided to reconsider this mechanism.\r\nIn this connection, and in the light of other realities\r\nof the modern world, it seems appropriate to change the\r\nprocedure that now allows one State to block the solution\r\nof a question that is of concern to the entire international\r\ncommunity. For instance, consideration might be given to\r\nthe idea of weighted voting. Another possibility is to\r\nentrust the General Assembly with the right to overrule\r\nthe veto if it was imposed by only one permanent\r\nmember. There are also other proposals on this matter.\r\nChanging the existing procedure would constitute an\r\nimportant element in the democratization of the Security\r\nCouncil in particular and the United Nations in general.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine also shares the view,\r\nrepeatedly expressed in the Working Group, that greater\r\ntransparency must be ensured in the work of the Security\r\nCouncil, particularly in the decision-making process. We\r\nthink that this would allow all Members of the\r\nOrganization to participate more actively in the Council’s\r\nwork and would ensure stronger support for its decisions\r\nby all Member States.\r\nThe Working Group has done extremely important\r\nwork. It has showed how States Members of the United\r\nNations perceive the Security Council. The range of\r\nrelevant views is very broad but much is still to be done\r\nto coordinate positions so that future membership of the\r\nCouncil, the efficiency of its work, and its composition\r\nmeet the interests of all regional groups, all States in\r\ngeneral, and each State in particular. Ukraine is ready to\r\ncooperate with other States for precisely such a reform of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nMr. Yañez-Barnuevo (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Almost exactly 50 years ago, on 9 November\r\n1944, the proposals for the establishment of an international\r\norganization were published. They were then placed before\r\nthe San Francisco Conference and subsequently formed the\r\nbasis of the Charter of the United Nations. These proposals\r\nwere prepared, as everyone knows, in the Dumbarton Oaks\r\ntalks, with the participation of delegations from the United\r\nStates, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and China.\r\nI would point out that the effort that has been\r\nundertaken by the General Assembly almost half a century\r\nlater has not emanated from such a small group of States\r\nbut, on the contrary, involves the totality of the membership\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nI wish to begin by expressing my delegation’s\r\ngratitude to Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana for\r\nthe devotion and hard work with which, as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, he presided over the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. Our gratitude goes, too, to the Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Working Group, Ambassador Wilhelm\r\nBreitenstein of Finland and Ambassador Chew Tai Soo of\r\nSingapore, who also made noteworthy contributions to the\r\nprogress of our work.\r\nSince last year, when the General Assembly decided\r\nin its resolution 48/26 to set up the Working Group,\r\nprogress has undeniably been made. The Working Group\r\nhas held many meetings and has heard the views of many\r\nMember States on all the issues, which have thus been\r\nclearly identified. All these statements are a very valuable\r\nbasis for our continued work, as are the documents\r\nprepared by the Secretariat and by the Chairman of the\r\nWorking Group, Ambassador Insanally, and the written\r\ninputs from several delegations or groups of delegations.\r\nAs the report of the Working Group states\r\n“While there was a convergence of views that the\r\nmembership of the Security Council should be\r\nenlarged, there was also agreement that the scope and\r\nnature of such enlargement require further discussion.”\r\n(A/48/47, para. 8)\r\nSo we still need to go into greater depth and discuss further\r\nthe scope of this area of convergence.\r\nLast year the Spanish delegation outlined the\r\nprinciples on the basis of which, in its view, the reform of\r\nthe Security Council should be approached:\r\nrepresentativeness, effectiveness and transparency. We\r\nshould also bear in mind that the final objective of the\r\nreform must be to strengthen the legitimacy of the\r\nSecurity Council’s activities. These principles and this\r\nobjective are still fully valid. With regard to transparency,\r\non the initiative of the members of the Security Council,\r\nsince last year practical arrangements have been worked\r\nout to make it easier for all the Members of the United\r\nNations to follow the work of the Council; those\r\narrangements still need to be refined and updated.\r\nThe Council also has before it proposals presented\r\nby the delegations of Argentina and New Zealand which,\r\nin my delegation’s opinion, deserve to be taken into\r\naccount with a view to improving the Council’s\r\nmonitoring of peace-keeping operations and consultations\r\nwith troop-contributing States and other States particularly\r\ninterested in a given situation.\r\nReform of the Security Council is a tremendously\r\ncomplex issue and should be approached in a well-\r\nthought-out way through a process of dialogue that will\r\nlead to understanding among all Member States. In an\r\nissue of such transcendental importance, consensus is\r\nessential.\r\nSpain is in favour of a moderate increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, an increase that\r\nwould allow for the more frequent presence in the\r\nCouncil of States whose weight and influence in\r\ninternational affairs is unquestioned and which have the\r\nwill and the ability to contribute significantly to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to the\r\nachievement of other purposes of the United Nations as\r\nset forth in Article 29 of the Charter.\r\nThe expansion of the Council would also facilitate\r\nequitable geographical representation, again in accordance\r\nwith Article 23, thus making it possible for many\r\nmedium-sized and small countries that thus far have not\r\nbeen able to do so to take a direct part in the Council’s\r\nwork. In any event, it is essential to maintain the principle\r\nenshrined in Article 24 of the Charter that the Security\r\nCouncil acts on behalf of all the Members of the United\r\nNations in carrying out its duties related to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nMr. Arystanbekova (Kazakhstan), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nWe must also keep in mind that any expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council should go hand in hand with a\r\nmodification of the majorities required for the adoption of\r\ndecisions. In this respect we believe that we can distinguish\r\nbetween three categories of issues on which decisions are\r\ntaken: first, procedural questions; secondly, substantive\r\nquestions not within the purview of Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter — fundamentally, matters relating to the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes; and, thirdly, questions falling within\r\nthe framework of Chapter VII, which presuppose recourse\r\nto enforcement measures.\r\nEach of those categories of actions by the Council\r\nwould require a different majority, which would be larger\r\nif the decision to be taken was more important. This would\r\nmake it possible to establish that the so-called veto right\r\nwould be applied only to the third category of decisions: in\r\nother words, to those adopted under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter. It should be recalled that a proposal of this kind\r\nwas made by the United States and the United Kingdom\r\nduring the Dumbarton Oaks talks, but it was rejected by the\r\nSoviet delegation on instructions from Stalin himself.\r\nThe Working Group now has an abundance of\r\ndocumentation, including a large number of national\r\nreplies containing proposals and observations that must still\r\nbe made more specific. It cannot yet be said that there are\r\nareas on which decisions can be taken at this stage. This is\r\nindicated by the report of the Working Group itself.\r\nNonetheless, there is sufficient material that, if\r\nappropriately structured, could enable us, as we proceed in\r\nour work, to identify broad areas of consensus. My\r\ndelegation takes the view that the present configuration of\r\nthe Working Group should be retained so that it can\r\ncontinue its deliberations at this forty-ninth session. In view\r\nof the large amount of work we must do during this main\r\npart of the session, the substantive work of the Working\r\nGroup might be resumed in 1995, so that all delegations\r\ncould be on an equal footing and able to participate fully\r\nand make their contributions. At the same time, we should\r\nkeep in mind the need to give the public appropriate\r\ninformation on the work being done.\r\nAs to the format for the discussions, we need a new\r\nformula that, based on the proposals made at the last\r\nsession, would make it possible to build on the work\r\nalready done, without prejudice to the right of those\r\ndelegations that have not yet expressed their views to do so,\r\nwhen they deem it appropriate, in plenary meetings.\r\nI assure the Assembly that my delegation will continue\r\nto take part in the work of the Working Group and to\r\nextend the necessary cooperation to the presidency so that\r\nwe can move towards consensus and reach generally\r\nagreed-upon conclusions by the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. To this end, we shall of course need the\r\nassistance and participation of all the States Members of\r\nthe United Nations in a collective endeavour by the whole\r\ninternational community.\r\nMr. Aita (San Marino): Let me begin by assuring\r\nthe Assembly that although our delegation’s support for\r\nalmost all of the proposals previously outlined by\r\nAmbassador Fulci and elaborated yesterday by Mr.\r\nCaputo, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Italy, is not based solely on our great affinity with\r\nItaly: our undeniable wealth of traditional culture, our\r\ncomplex economic and financial ties and our common\r\nlove of freedom, democracy, peace, security, human rights\r\nand prosperity.\r\nYesterday we heard from many delegations that have\r\nfound the Italian proposal a solid foundation upon which\r\nto build. San Marino, which had the opportunity to\r\nparticipate actively in the Working Group on the reform\r\nof the Security Council, has paid particular attention to\r\nthe statements made during yesterday’s and today’s\r\ndebates, and we have noted an almost total consensus in\r\nthree major areas: the Security Council must be enlarged;\r\nit must be made more democratic, with particular focus\r\nupon transparency and accountability; and it must reflect\r\nglobal political realities, old and new.\r\nThe large industrialized States have never really had\r\nany problems over representation — or almost anything\r\nelse. They are big enough and powerful enough to take\r\ncare of themselves. Medium-sized States, developing or\r\nindustrialized, have done very well during the last 49\r\nyears. We wish them continued luck. Small States,\r\nhowever, have not been as lucky. They comprise about\r\n125 Members and thus constitute the two-thirds majority\r\nneeded for amendment of the Charter, should amendment\r\ntake place. These small States have not had their\r\nproportional share of representation on the Security\r\nCouncil. Equitable representation is the main issue; it is\r\nthe reason for our presence here today, and it led to the\r\nformation of the Open-ended Working Group. It is one of\r\nthe most important issues concerning the small States,\r\nincluding San Marino.\r\nIn plain, simple language, small States want a finger\r\nin the pie — the opportunity to participate in the\r\ndecision-making process, to promote and further\r\nconsolidate the principle of the need to defend all States\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nthat cannot militarily defend themselves, and to share the\r\nresponsibility of advancing the peace and security agenda\r\nwhile ameliorating human rights and increasing prosperity\r\nin every corner of the world.\r\nSan Marino is a small State, but we proudly declare\r\nthat our total contribution to the regular United Nations\r\nbudget is higher per capita than that of all other Member\r\nStates. We have no oil; our natural resources are small; but\r\nSan Marino does what is necessary to participate financially\r\nin the work of the United Nations, simply because of our\r\ndeep feeling for the spirit of democracy, which has lived in\r\nSan Marino for more than 1700 years and which has\r\nprompted San Marino to assume its democratic role\r\nwhenever it can. The Secretary-General addressed the\r\nGeneral Assembly on Wednesday, urging Member States\r\nthat had not done so to pay their dues. He definitely did not\r\nhave San Marino in mind.\r\nThe Italian proposal would give small States 10 non-\r\npermanent seats on the Security Council, to be shared by\r\n125 States on a frequent-rotation basis. In view of the\r\nconsiderable number of small States, that proposal is hardly\r\nUtopian. Nevertheless it at least guarantees us the\r\nenjoyment of our equitable rights approximately once every\r\n22 years, should we opt for two-year tenure. Should we,\r\nhowever, opt for only one year, that right would be\r\nexercised in almost half the time, that is, once every 12\r\nyears for each of the 125 small States.\r\nAs for the election mechanism, that is up to the small\r\nStates to decide. Either constituency or regional grouping\r\nwould, in the final analysis, lead to the same results once\r\na 22-year or 12-year frequent rotation schedule was\r\nadopted.\r\nWith regard to the transparency and democratization\r\nof the Security Council, we have repeatedly stated that\r\nimportant consultations held behind closed doors are here\r\nto stay. Their abolition does not seem to be realistically\r\nfeasible. So-called real politics dictates otherwise. Certainly,\r\nwe do not welcome such consultations wholeheartedly, but\r\nby their very delicate nature they are essential in every\r\ncommunity, including a democratic one.\r\nOn 15 June this year our delegation suggested a\r\nstipulation that any proposed amendment to a draft\r\nresolution considered in an informal meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil must be made only in writing and be printed\r\nimmediately in blue, thus allowing every interested party to\r\nhave access to it. With the blue copy in our hands, we\r\nwould be in a position, first, to follow the evolution of\r\nissues under consideration; secondly, to acquaint ourselves\r\nwith draft resolutions; and, thirdly, eventually to share to\r\na certain extent in the strength of the decision-making\r\nprocess, while keeping the informal, closed consultation\r\nintact. Would not the blue version of any amended draft\r\nresolution give us the transparency to which we aspire,\r\nwithout disturbing the imperative need for discreet and\r\neven secret negotiations, which are imperatively needed?\r\nBriefings could be carried out by the President of the\r\nSecurity Council regularly, in the presence of the\r\nChairmen of the regional Groups, to acquaint the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly with the Council’s\r\nworkings; it would greatly help us to receive first-hand\r\ninformation on decisions from those who had participated\r\nin their making.\r\nOur delegation heard with pleasure the\r\nannouncement yesterday concerning the renomination of\r\nthe two Vice-Chairmen of our Open-ended Working\r\nGroup, Ambassador Breitenstein of Finland and\r\nAmbassador Chew of Singapore. They both made\r\nremarkable efforts to make our deliberations, within the\r\nframework of our mandate, impeccable. When speaking\r\nof the two Vice-Chairmen, we must also express our\r\nhighest esteem to Ambassador Insanally, who as President\r\nof the General Assembly, guided us all with his articulate\r\neloquence and reliability.\r\nOn several occasions my delegation has expressed a\r\ndesire to open the doors of our deliberations in the Open-\r\nended Working Group to the media as a serious step\r\ntowards the further democratization of our work. Nothing\r\nsimilar has been undertaken over the past 50 years, and,\r\nmost probably, nothing similar will be undertaken for\r\ndecades to come. I should like to repeat once again that\r\nthe press, both local and international, are the backbone\r\nof our democratic system and constitute an integral part\r\nof our healthy structure. Stimulating reporters,\r\neditorialists, commentators and other journalists to\r\ncriticize our endeavours and comment on our performance\r\nmay polish and renew our approach and conduce\r\nacamedic institutions to get involved in our work\r\nintellectually and academically.\r\nOur yearning to develop transparency in the Security\r\nCouncil will not be truly helped if we keep our own\r\ndoors closed while we ask the Council to keep its doors\r\nopen. We should be consistent. We believe in, and are\r\nproud of, the presentations we make. We are not and\r\ncannot be intimidated by the presence of a journalist, a\r\nreporter or a cameraman. Our voices should be heard all\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nover the world, not because we are only too proud of what\r\nwe are undertaking, but because we owe it to the world to\r\nlet it carefully watch us as we attempt to reform the most\r\nimportant body humanity has established — the Security\r\nCouncil, which is creating States, obliterating States,\r\nmoving frontiers and working for world peace and security.\r\nIt is incumbent upon the President, and the President\r\nalone, to keep the doors of our forthcoming meetings open\r\nwide. I should like to conclude by congratulating him on\r\nhis election. We look forward to seeing him play his role\r\nas a leader.\r\nMr. McKinnon (New Zealand): In the course of this\r\nyear Member States have had a thorough opportunity to\r\ndiscuss representation on the Security Council and related\r\nmatters. Those discussions were constructive, frank and\r\ndetailed. All issues were traversed and all points of view\r\nwere heard. This, in itself, is useful. We now have a body\r\nof debate on which we can draw in future discussions.\r\nThe draft resolution before us would provide for the\r\ncontinuation of that discussion at this session and for a\r\nfurther report to be submitted by the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup before the end of the session. My delegation\r\nsupports the draft resolution, but we believe that we need\r\nto think very clearly about what we should seek to achieve\r\nnext year. There is very little point in recycling the\r\ndiscussion we had this year.\r\nNew Zealand reached certain conclusions from the\r\ndiscussion in the Working Group. These conclusions were\r\nset out by the New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs and\r\nTrade in his general debate statement on 27 September. I\r\ndo not propose to repeat them here. However, they will\r\nremain the focus for New Zealand’s ongoing consideration\r\nof this question.\r\nVarious proposals were made in the Assembly’s\r\ngeneral debate — either specific elements of reform or\r\nsomething approaching a total package. We note in\r\nparticular the very detailed suggestions set out by the\r\nAustralian Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans.\r\nIn our view, the time has now come for the Working\r\nGroup to consider concrete proposals for reform. We do not\r\nmean that the Working Group should expect to take a\r\ndecision on such proposals in short order. But concrete\r\nproposals will focus the next debate and will help to\r\ndetermine where the consensus might lie.\r\nWe say this because, in our view, if we are to make\r\nprogress, proposals must encompass the totality of the\r\nissues that were debated earlier this year. Given the\r\nvariety of perspectives that Member States bring to this\r\nissue, it would make no sense, and would not be\r\nacceptable, to seek to deal with the question of expansion\r\nin unrelated parts. If for no other reason, such a mode of\r\nproceeding could scarcely be construed as equitable. And\r\nequity — fairness and balance — are what we are\r\nrequired to achieve.\r\nWhat does this mean in practice?\r\nFirst, proposals must deal not only with the question\r\nof expansion but also with how that expansion should be\r\ndistributed, bearing in mind that the Charter has always\r\nmade provision for a geographical allocation of seats on\r\nthe Council.\r\nSecondly, proposals should not be made that are\r\nnarrowly limited with regard to the nature of the\r\nexpansion they propose. For instance, it would be very\r\nunwise for any delegation to propose that the Assembly\r\ntake action on an increase in the number of permanent\r\nmembers alone. Any attempt at such a process would be\r\ndoomed to failure at the ratification stage.\r\nThirdly, given the difficulties that stand in the way\r\nof achieving consensus on the question of new permanent\r\nmembers — especially given the near-universal opposition\r\nto extending the veto — any concrete proposal, to have\r\na realistic chance of success, needs to contain options for\r\nhandling the aspirations of those States with an expressed\r\nand widely supported interest in relatively regular\r\nmembership. For my delegation the key to the successful\r\nhandling of such aspirations is to look at solutions that\r\nare regionally based. Different regions have quite\r\ndifferent approaches. For some, competitive elections will\r\nbe the way ahead; others may prefer some form of intra-\r\nregional arrangement on representation. But whatever\r\napproach is adopted, we believe that a measure of\r\naccountability based on performance should be at the\r\nheart of any reform.\r\nFourthly — a point worth making when we speak of\r\naccountability — perhaps any amendment to the Charter\r\nshould include a provision that no Member State that is\r\nin arrears in its financial contributions should expect to be\r\non the Council.\r\nFifthly, while it is not essential to reconfigure the\r\nregional groups as part of this exercise, the Australian\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nproposal demonstrates why we might need to do so. This\r\nsuggests that any comprehensive proposal will need to take\r\naccount of that aspect.\r\nSixthly, to move forward we shall need to examine, in\r\nthe context of concrete proposals, other necessary\r\nadjustments to the Charter. For example, if we were to\r\nremove the prohibition against the immediate re-election of\r\nnon-permanent members would there be a need for the\r\ninsertion, instead, of some alternative provision, such as a\r\nrule that no non-permanent member should be elected to\r\nserve more than four years out of six or eight years out\r\nof 10?\r\nFinally, I need to address the second but no less\r\nimportant limb of the Working Group’s mandate and of our\r\ndraft resolution — the “related matters”. For my delegation,\r\nreforming the way the Security Council operates is every\r\nbit as important as reforming its membership. Indeed,\r\nNew Zealand suggests that, even if we were able to achieve\r\nthe perfect size and balance, we would still have almost all\r\nthe problems we have today unless the members of the new\r\nSecurity Council changed the Council’s ways of doing\r\nbusiness.\r\nI am not going to repeat what we have said in the\r\nWorking Group, where we reviewed the useful\r\nimprovements that have already been made in Security\r\nCouncil practice — which we applaud — and the very\r\nmany more changes that need to be made in the near future.\r\nNew Zealand feels some small sense of\r\naccomplishment in that, along with a number of like-\r\nminded colleagues on the Security Council, it has played a\r\nrole in beginning to make the necessary changes. But we\r\nhave some very important unfinished business. I am\r\nreferring to the urgent need for reform in the Security\r\nCouncil’s practice in respect of consultation with countries\r\ncontributing troops to peace-keeping operations and with\r\nregional countries. Together with Argentina, we have\r\ncirculated in the Security Council a draft resolution on this\r\nsubject.\r\nWe are working very hard to achieve consensus on\r\nthis proposal. We value the very wide support and\r\nencouragement that has been forthcoming from the\r\nmembers of the General Assembly, and we would\r\nappreciate further such input.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran): As one of\r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations, the Security\r\nCouncil has had conferred on it by the Members of the\r\nOrganization responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Unfortunately, the\r\nCouncil was unable to play the role expected of it,\r\nespecially during the cold war era, when bloc rivalries\r\nwere the most prominent characteristic of international\r\nrelations.\r\nMoreover, the exercise of the veto by the permanent\r\nmembers, in the service of their self-interests at the\r\nexpense of global peace, moved the Council in a direction\r\nwhich, on numerous occasions — threats to peace,\r\nbreaches of the peace or acts of aggression — prevented\r\nit from acting on behalf of the entire membership of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nHowever, new international circumstances have\r\ncreated added responsibilities for the United Nations, and\r\nthis fact makes it all the more imperative that the Security\r\nCouncil be reformed to enable it to discharge its duties in\r\na more efficient and effective manner.\r\nDuring the past year the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nconsidered some aspects of reform of the Council. In our\r\nview — and this is something that has been said by\r\nothers — the current composition of the Security Council\r\ndoes not represent the general membership of the United\r\nNations. At present, the indications are that developed\r\ncountries are over-represented while the developing\r\ncountries are under-represented. That being the case,\r\nevery effort should be made to ensure equitable and\r\nbalanced representation in the Council. The new\r\ncomposition of the Council should be based on the\r\nsovereign equality of States and on equitable regional\r\nrepresentation.\r\nWhile enlargement of the Security Council is a\r\nmatter of importance, it is not an end in itself but a\r\nmeans of improving the ways in which the Council\r\nshoulders its responsibilities. More important, the\r\nCouncil’s working methods and procedures, as well as its\r\ndecision-making process, need to be improved. In this\r\nregard, my delegation wishes to underline several points.\r\nFirst, the Security Council has failed to adopt a\r\nbalanced approach in dealing with different crises, and\r\nsome permanent members have persisted in the\r\napplication of double standards. This is inimical to the\r\ncredibility and legitimacy of the Council. One vivid\r\nexample in this regard is the Council’s approach to the\r\naggression against the Republic of Bosnia and\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nHerzegovina and the Council’s questionable handling of the\r\ncrisis.\r\nSecondly, while my delegation recognizes the need for\r\nthe holding of appropriate informal consultations among\r\nmembers of the Council, some mechanism should be\r\ndevised to inform, and if required consult with, non-\r\nmembers of the Council. Since the Council’s effectiveness\r\nis intertwined with the commitment of the Member States,\r\nit is essential to retain the moral legitimacy of the Council\r\nby ensuring the participation of Member States in the\r\ndecision-making process. It is unfortunate to note that in\r\nsome cases even non-permanent members of the Council\r\nare not consulted.\r\nThirdly, a new balance should be struck between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council to fill the\r\nexisting gap between the general membership and the\r\nCouncil. In this context, the jurisdiction and prerogative of\r\nthe General Assembly with respect to international peace\r\nand security should not be overlooked. Moreover, on the\r\nbasis of Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter, the Security\r\nCouncil should submit annual reports to the General\r\nAssembly for its consideration. It goes without saying that\r\nthe Council should present comprehensive and analytical\r\nreports to the Assembly rather than a compilation of\r\ndocument symbols and references.\r\nFourthly, veto power is incompatible with the\r\nobjective of democratizing the United Nations. This power,\r\nwhich has lost its raison d’être, must therefore be removed\r\nor at least drastically revised and brought into line with the\r\nreform of the United Nations so that a democratic process\r\nof decision-making may be achieved. As my Foreign\r\nMinister pointed out before this General Assembly, just two\r\nweeks ago:\r\n“If we are sincere in our belief that the world is so\r\nchanged that we must eliminate all references to\r\nenemy States\u0027 from the Charter, then why not also\r\nacknowledge that there is no further justification for\r\nholding on to privileges granted to the war victors of\r\nthat time?” (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nForty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th meeting,\r\np. 38)\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation pledges its full\r\ncooperation in the work of the Open-ended Working Group.\r\nIt is our hope that the Group’s work will be transparent and\r\nthat there will not just be a predetermined formula\r\npresented to the membership as a whole for approval.\r\nMr. Martinez Blanco (Honduras) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I am highly honoured to speak on behalf\r\nof the countries of Central America: Guatemala, El\r\nSalvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama.\r\nCentral America has been following the question of\r\nequitable representation on, and increase in, the\r\nmembership of the Security Council since the item was\r\nfirst included in the programme of work of the General\r\nAssembly, in 1979.\r\nThis issue, which is now included in the agenda of\r\nthis current session of the General Assembly as item 33,\r\nwas already a subject of consideration in the course of the\r\nforty-eighth session of this Assembly. Indeed, by its\r\nresolution 48/26 of 3 December 1993, the General\r\nAssembly took note of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, which reflected the view of a number of\r\nMember States on the item in question. Our region notes\r\nwith gratitude the report presented by the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council —\r\ndocument A/48/47, dated 2 September 1994.\r\nThat report gives a brief account of the work carried\r\nout, but it does not offer any conclusions or state any\r\ntangible results achieved on this issue. It is our hope that\r\nsome agreement or understanding on this matter will be\r\nreached shortly.\r\nEquitable representation on the Security Council and\r\nan increase in its membership — as has been clearly\r\nreflected in the statements made by the Heads of State,\r\nheads of delegations and Ministers of Foreign Affairs who\r\nhave addressed the General Assembly at this session —\r\nare the unanimous desire of the international community.\r\nReform of the Security Council is urgent: this fact is\r\nreflected in the documents issued by the Opened-ended\r\nWorking Group established by the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session and in the\r\nmeetings of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, as\r\nwell as by all the various international forums at which\r\nthis issue has been addressed.\r\nThus, as the States of Central America see it, it is\r\nnecessary to revise the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil on the basis of the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution — which will make it possible\r\nto increase the number of permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers on the most democratic basis possible — while\r\nstudying the desirability of creating a new category of\r\nsemi-permanent members, as suggested in the Open-ended\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nWorking Group. At the same time, thought needs to be\r\ngiven to the basic indicators that would enable us to\r\nestablish, in an appropriate way, the number of members.\r\nEquitable representation for the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations is all the more important in that, in\r\naccordance with the Charter, the decisions taken by the\r\nSecurity Council are taken on behalf of all Member States,\r\neven though all Member States are represented only in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. For this reason, the Security Council\r\nshould achieve greater coordination and transparency in its\r\nactivities in order to prevent a situation in which it would\r\nhave primacy over other organs of the United Nations.\r\nThe Central American States take the view that a\r\nSecurity Council with equitable and democratic\r\nrepresentation would place our Organization in a better\r\nposition to fulfil its purposes and principles, and would thus\r\ngive greater legitimacy to its decisions, which aim\r\nessentially at ensuring the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, respect for human rights and protection\r\nof the environment.\r\nIt is our hope that genuine and thorough reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, grounded in democratic principles of\r\nequitable geographical distribution of seats, would provide\r\nfor greater participation in the work of the Council for all\r\nMembers of the United Nations, including small States and,\r\nin general, all those States that have never had the\r\nopportunity to participate in the Council’s work. From this\r\nstandpoint, the proposals put forward by a number of\r\neminent persons at the current session of the General\r\nAssembly are extremely useful. Once they have been\r\ncarefully studied, they may well serve as the basis for a text\r\nthat reflects the objectives we all seek to achieve.\r\nThe countries of the Central American region believe\r\nthat any reform formula that is adopted should, in any\r\nevent, go hand in hand with corresponding reform to the\r\nCharter of the Organization and at the same time provide\r\nfor the total and absolute removal of the right of veto, a\r\nright currently enjoyed by the five permanent members.\r\nThe right of veto should not be granted to any State in\r\nany circumstances, whether they may be called permanent\r\nor semi-permanent members, for that right is an\r\nanachronism which 50 years ago may perhaps have had\r\nsome logical justification, since the world was just\r\nawakening from the nightmare of the Second World War.\r\nBut at the present time, now that the cold war is over, the\r\nright of veto no longer has any justification or raison\r\nd’être. Its total and utter removal will serve fully to\r\nsafeguard the principle of the sovereign equality of States\r\nMembers of this Organization, contained in Article 2 (1)\r\nof the Charter.\r\nSome months ago, the Secretary-General proposed\r\n“An Agenda for Peace”, and recently he has set forth the\r\nprinciples that should form the basis of “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment”. International conferences addressing\r\nvarious economic, social and humanitarian questions have\r\nbeen held at the highest level. It is in this context that we\r\nbelieve that the highest political decision-making body of\r\nour Organization should be democratized, and reflect the\r\nnew state of affairs prevailing today.\r\nOn 31 January 1992, a summit meeting of the\r\nSecurity Council was held. Heads of State or Government\r\nand Foreign Ministers at that meeting, particularly those\r\nof the permanent members of the Council, undertook to\r\nstrengthen the work of the Organization and to make it\r\neffective in order to act rapidly, firmly and impartially.\r\nBut in practice, the results of that meeting have been\r\nfairly meagre, and the credibility of the Organization has\r\nquite often been questioned. The next Security Council\r\nsummit meeting to be held early in 1995 and the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of our\r\nOrganization provide us with an opportunity to reaffirm\r\nand bolster its role, in particular the role of the Security\r\nCouncil, in order to realize mankind’s aspirations to\r\npeace, security and sustainable development.\r\nIn conclusion, the Central American States — the\r\nRepublics of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,\r\nNicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama — reaffirm their view\r\nthat after 50 years of existence a serious and thorough\r\nreview of the Charter of the United Nations is called for,\r\nparticularly where the Security Council is concerned, in\r\norder to adapt it to the times in which we live.\r\nMr. Cassar (Malta): Allow me at the outset to\r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session. Malta fondly recalls the service of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire on the Security Council 30 years ago when,\r\nin 1964, Malta became a Member of the United Nations.\r\nThis session of the Assembly is particularly fortunate\r\nin having the current President presiding over the\r\ndiscussion of this item, particularly in view of his\r\nexperience as President of the Security Council in January\r\n1990, and as representative of his country during Côte\r\nd’Ivoire’s second term on the Council. On both occasions,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire served the international community with\r\ngreat dedication.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nService on the Security Council is an onerous task,\r\nwhich Malta shared when it served during its term in 1983-\r\n1984.\r\nEmerging from the cold-war era with an authority and\r\neffectiveness that belie its many years of sterility, the\r\nSecurity Council is also, however, clearly in need of\r\nfunctional reform. Addressing this issue at the Institute of\r\nInternational Relations in Budapest earlier this year, Malta’s\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr.\r\nGuido de Marco, stated that\r\n“Any consideration of reform of the Security Council,\r\nbe this in terms of composition or of the working\r\nmethods, is surrounded by the legitimate concern that\r\nno proposed action should impair its existing vitality.\r\nThe real dilemma lies, however, in the fact that its\r\npresent course of action could, if it remains\r\nunsupported by some measure of reform, itself lead to\r\nan undermining of this vitality”.\r\nThis is the principal criterion that has guided the\r\ndelegation of Malta in its approach to the discussion on the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council.\r\nConscious as it is of the legitimate concern that no\r\nproposed action should impair the Council’s existing\r\nvitality, my Government ascribes great importance to this\r\ndebate for the future evolution of the United Nations.\r\nNotwithstanding the complex issues involved, we have\r\nmade a good start and notable progress. Under the able\r\nchairmanship of the President of the General Assembly,\r\nAmbassador Insanally, and his two Vice-Chairmen, the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group established pursuant to General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/26 of 3 December 1993 held 22\r\nmeetings.\r\nDelegations, my own included, engaged in frank and\r\nconstructive discussions and expressed themselves on all\r\nitems under consideration by the Working Group, including\r\nthe relationship of the Security Council with the General\r\nAssembly, the regional distribution on the Council, the\r\ncategories of membership and the Security Council’s\r\nworking methods, procedures and decision-making.\r\nIn deciding to establish the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup, General Assembly resolution 48/26 recalls that the\r\nMembers of the United Nations confer on the Security\r\nCouncil\r\n“primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and agree that in\r\ncarrying out its duty under this responsibility the\r\nSecurity Council acts on their behalf”.\r\nThe need to review the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and related matters was recognized in view of the\r\nsubstantial increase in the membership of the United\r\nNations as well as the changes in international relations.\r\nBearing in mind the need to continue to enhance the\r\nefficiency of the Security Council, the Assembly\r\nreaffirmed the principle of the sovereign equality of all\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nMy Government feels that equitable representation\r\nis primarily linked to a qualitative, rather than\r\nquantitative, change in the relationship between the\r\nCouncil and the rest of the United Nations membership.\r\nThe present ongoing debate has already generated\r\nsome beneficial developments in this regard. My\r\ndelegation, like others, welcomes the improvements made\r\nto date, such as daily publication in the Journal of the\r\nprovisional agenda; the monthly circulation of the\r\nCouncil’s tentative forecast of its programme of work; the\r\navailability of Security Council draft resolutions in “blue”\r\nat the same time Council members receive them; and the\r\nbriefings by the President of the Security Council to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the Chairmen of\r\nthe regional groups.\r\nAnother important and welcome development is the\r\nSecurity Council’s more elaborate consultations with\r\npresent and potential troop contributors on different\r\naspects of peace-keeping operations. This practice —\r\nparticularly beneficial prior to the setting up of a peace-\r\nkeeping operation — could be of inspiration in fostering\r\nconsultations with interested parties on other issues on\r\nwhich the Security Council may decide.\r\nImportant as they are, these changes on their own do\r\nnot resolve the wider question, that is, whether the rest of\r\nthe United Nations membership should remain a passive,\r\nhowever well-informed, bystander at the Council’s\r\ndeliberations.\r\nThere is good cause to believe that both a reasonable\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nan appraisal and review of the rights of its members\r\nwould constitute positive measures of reform. The\r\nSecurity Council was expanded from 11 to 15 members\r\nin 1965 to reflect the growth in United Nations\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nmembership from the original 51 to 113. Malta believes\r\nthat further expansion of the Security Council is now\r\nwarranted in order to reflect today’s United Nations\r\nmembership of 184 States.\r\nAt the same time, we believe, as do others, that one of\r\nthe major strengths of the Security Council lies in its\r\nlimited membership. For this reason, my delegation would\r\nsupport a prudent increase of not more than 10 seats.\r\nAn increase in Security Council membership would\r\nstill leave the vast majority of United Nations Member\r\nStates outside this inner circle. It is therefore in terms of\r\nthe manner in which this inner circle, however constituted,\r\nis seen to act in response to the concerns of the wider\r\nmembership that the most urgent measures relating to the\r\nSecurity Council must be contemplated. In this context, the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly assumes far-reaching importance.\r\nA revitalized General Assembly gains greater authority\r\nand credibility as it increasingly transforms itself into the\r\neffective organ through which the necessary collective input\r\ninto the deliberations of other components of the United\r\nNations system, not least the Security Council, could be\r\nmade. This enhanced symbiotic relationship is positive in\r\nitself in that it helps ward off situations of possible\r\ndissonance between these two main organs.\r\nAddressing an experts’ meeting at the Foundation for\r\nInternational Studies in Valletta to discuss the theme “A\r\nSecond-Generation United Nations”, my Foreign Minister\r\nlast week stressed the need for enhanced cooperation\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly.\r\nProfessor de Marco cautioned against\r\n“a situation where the thinking of the Security Council\r\ncould be in divergence with that of the General\r\nAssembly. If this happens, the effectiveness and the\r\nefficiency of the Security Council will be put into\r\ndoubt”.\r\nIn this spirit, we welcome the adoption of General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/264 on 17 August 1994 entitled\r\n“Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly”, and\r\nin particular operative paragraph 4, which invites the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly\r\n“to propose appropriate ways and means to facilitate\r\nan in-depth discussion by the Assembly of matters\r\ncontained in the reports submitted to it by the Security\r\nCouncil.”\r\nAn increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil could only enhance the existing confidence of the\r\nbroader United Nations membership in its decisions and\r\nwould further buttress the Council’s authority.\r\nThe membership issue and the question of the status\r\nof different members on the Security Council have\r\nassumed predominance throughout our deliberations in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group.\r\nIf there is a linear expansion of the existing\r\ncategories of the Council, we shall be comforted by the\r\nknowledge of a working method which we have\r\nwitnessed to date. Like any other gradual, quantitative\r\nevolution, however, it has its merits and its drawbacks.\r\nOn the other hand, the introduction of new\r\ncategories of membership is challenging, and, like any\r\nchallenge, at one and the same time stimulates our\r\ninstitutional creativity but generates that sense of cautious\r\nawareness necessarily encountered when formulating new\r\nmechanisms.\r\nMy Government is giving serious thought and\r\nconsideration to the whole range of proposals submitted\r\nto date. We all are conscious of our grave responsibility.\r\nThe reforms we will ultimately adopt will be as long-\r\nlasting as they are equitable and able to reflect a\r\nconstantly evolving international reality.\r\nLike others, we have expressed the hope that through\r\nthe full cooperation of all Member States, the Working\r\nGroup will endeavour to conclude its work by next year\r\nin order to make its results coincide with the fiftieth\r\nanniversary. This is a time-frame that should encourage\r\nus in seeking common ground on which to build\r\nconstructively — not an ever-shortening fuse to force\r\nupon us solutions of which we may not be fully\r\nconvinced. In our deliberations, we must constantly\r\nensure that form follows substance, rather than vice versa.\r\nAny reform, be it in terms of composition or of\r\nworking methods, while reflecting more accurately the\r\ncurrent international situation, must continue to make the\r\nwork of the Security Council more transparent but retain\r\nwithin the Council that quality of realpolitik that is a\r\nbasic ingredient of inter-State relations.\r\nMy delegation pledges its full cooperation in the\r\nendeavours of the Working Group. A firm commitment to\r\nthe principles of the Charter should inspire us in this\r\ndebate as it does in others. Our interest must remain that\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nof ensuring “prompt and effective action by the United\r\nNations” in the “maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity”.\r\nMr. Ould Ely (Mauritania) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Since this is the first time I have spoken before\r\nthe Assembly in my new capacity as Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, may\r\nI be allowed to say how pleased and honoured I am to see\r\nMr. Amara Essy presiding over the Assembly’s work at this\r\nsession. His country, Côte d’Ivoire, where I had the\r\nprivilege to serve, is for us Mauritanians a model of\r\nwisdom and moderation and a resolute champion in the\r\npromotion of the ideals of peace, solidarity and cooperation\r\nembodied in our Organization.\r\nThe question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters, which is the subject of today’s debate, is\r\nwithout any doubt an important matter that requires\r\nsustained efforts and a convergence of views that can\r\nenable us to attain the objectives we all desire. In this\r\ncontext, we welcome the progress already made in this area\r\nunder the chairmanship of President Essy’s predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, with the assistance of Vice-\r\nChairmen Wilhelm Breitenstein of Finland and Chew Tai\r\nSoo of Singapore.\r\nWe also salute the intention of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session to continue this effort\r\nwith the assistance of the same team. Such continuity will\r\nno doubt make it possible for us to speed up our work and\r\nkeep it on the right path. As always, Mauritania will make\r\na positive contribution to our common endeavour.\r\nThe end of the cold war, the many developments that\r\nhave taken place on the international scene, the substantial\r\nincrease in United Nations activities in the areas of peace\r\nand security and the growing universality of the\r\nOrganization clearly require us now to adapt our structures\r\nand methods of work to these circumstances. In view of the\r\nchanges that have taken place in our governing bodies over\r\nrecent years, the Security Council should not be excluded\r\nfrom the modifications made necessary by the new\r\ninternational situation. This is why we have always\r\nsupported and will continue to support efforts aimed at both\r\nexpanding the Council’s membership so that it can reflect\r\nthe realities of today’s world and making it more able to\r\ndeal effectively with the many challenges it faces.\r\nThere is no doubt that both the universality of our\r\nOrganization and the Charter itself, which in Article 24\r\nconfers on the Council primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, call for\r\nthe Council to act swiftly and effectively and also to take\r\ninto account the interests of all States, without distinction.\r\nThis is why the question of equitable representation is of\r\ncrucial importance. Indeed, since the Council acts on\r\nbehalf of the States Members of the Organization and its\r\ndecisions are binding on them, it is essential that it be\r\nseen as an entity whose legitimacy, equity and credibility\r\nare beyond all doubt. Hence, enlarging the Council can\r\nonly strengthen it by enabling it to respond effectively\r\nand appropriately to present-day realities. In this light, the\r\nCouncil should reflect all currents of thought and all\r\ngeographical regions of the world.\r\nThe membership of the Council is a key issue, but\r\nits operation and its methods of work are no less\r\nimportant; they, too, need to be adapted to new realities.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the measures already agreed\r\non concerning its methods of work, particularly the timely\r\nadoption and presentation of reports to the General\r\nAssembly. However, we believe that further work must be\r\ndone to establish more effective cooperation and\r\ncoordination with the General Assembly on a more solid\r\nand consistent basis, because the General Assembly is\r\nstill the forum in which all States can freely and\r\ndemocratically express their views. The largest possible\r\nnumber of States must be able to participate in the\r\ndecision-making process, and this also calls for greater\r\ntransparency, which is always the foundation of\r\ndemocracy and accountability.\r\nLike the vast majority of Members of our\r\nOrganization, my country subscribes to the idea of a\r\nbroadly representative, transparent and democratic\r\nSecurity Council. This is why we believe it is essential\r\nfor the Open-ended Working Group on this issue to\r\ncontinue its efforts to discharge the mandate entrusted to\r\nit under resolution 48/26, adopted at the General\r\nAssembly’s last session. We hope that at the fiftieth\r\nsession the Working Group will submit to us a detailed\r\nand comprehensive report that justifies our efforts. We\r\nhave no doubt that the upcoming summit of the countries\r\nmembers of the Security Council, to be held in January\r\nnext year, will provide new impetus for our work in this\r\narea. May our efforts meet with great success.\r\nMr. Shambos (Cyprus): I would like at the outset to\r\nexpress our deep appreciation to Ambassador Insanally of\r\nGuyana, who chaired the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nthe Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council, and to welcome\r\nthe report of the Working Group.\r\nSince its admission to the United Nations in 1960,\r\nCyprus has consistently been a strong supporter of the\r\nUnited Nations, whose principles and objectives form the\r\ncornerstone of our foreign policy.\r\nBeing a small country, we entrust our security and our\r\nvery existence to the United Nations. We want to see it\r\nfurther strengthened and the spheres of its activities\r\nexpanded. We believe that in this emerging new world\r\norder it is more necessary than ever that the United Nations\r\nbe capable of fulfilling the role entrusted to it by the\r\nCharter as the guarantor of peace, security and social justice\r\nin the world.\r\nIt is against this background that we consider that\r\nimprovements to the effectiveness and credibility of the\r\ndecision-making organ of the United Nations are both\r\nurgent and compelling. The Security Council, which the\r\nCharter entrusts with the primary responsibility for\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, needs to\r\nundergo quantitative changes corresponding to the dramatic\r\nincrease of the membership of the United Nations, as well\r\nas qualitative adjustments to the method of its work that\r\nwill maintain the democratic processes which form the\r\nbasis of the United Nations.\r\nThe Security Council is indeed faced with enormous\r\ntasks. Its mandatory decisions, which are binding on all\r\nMembers and have immense impact on millions of people,\r\nmust be reached in such a way as to reflect fully the wishes\r\nand positions of the United Nations membership and the\r\ninternational community. Expansion of the Security Council\r\nis therefore imperative, while the qualitative changes\r\nreferred to above are indispensable. Expansion alone,\r\nhowever, will not solve every problem. There must be\r\naccountability in the membership and strict and objective\r\npersistence in the implementation of its resolutions and the\r\nopenness of its operations.\r\nSeveral most useful ideas have emerged during this\r\ndebate and in the discussions of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council. In the\r\ncontext of greater transparency in the Security Council’s\r\ndecision-making processes, various measures have been\r\nsuggested. We consider most of these proposals, and\r\nparticularly that concerning the participation of non-\r\nmembers in the informal consultations of the Council, to be\r\nextremely important. For we should not forget that, under\r\nthe prevailing conditions and procedures, inadequate\r\ntransparency has led to bitter experiences, to say the least,\r\nfor many, including my country. We look forward to the\r\nintensification of these discussions during the present\r\nsession. We believe that any enlargement must take into\r\nconsideration equitable geographical representation as\r\nwell as the need to increase the transparency of its work\r\nand — I repeat — its accountability to the wider\r\nmembership.\r\nWhile the matter of increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council is pressing, final decisions as to its\r\nenlargement must be carefully weighed and fully debated.\r\nAny hasty treatment of this most serious subject will not\r\nprovide a just solution to this issue. The reform and\r\nexpansion of the Security Council should include\r\nmeasures geared to reforming its working methods and\r\nprocedures. There is also a need to enhance the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly in accordance with the relevant provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nNon-selectivity, impartiality and absolute and\r\ngenuine respect for the sovereign equality of States should\r\nbe the guiding standards in the process of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. Genuine adherence to and a proven\r\nrecord in upholding the provisions and promoting the\r\nprinciples of the Charter should be a determining factor\r\nin the whole process.\r\nIn conclusion, may I also recall the words of\r\nPresident Clerides before this body on 3 October:\r\n“the effectiveness of the most powerful organ of the\r\nUnited Nations is seriously compromised if it applies\r\ndouble standards. It must act in every case with\r\ndetermination and consistency. The record of its\r\nperformance indicates clearly that in those cases\r\nwhere the international community has shown\r\nsteadfastness to defend the principles enshrined in\r\nthe United Nations Charter and fully to implement\r\nits provisions, peace and justice was achieved. On\r\nthe contrary, in those cases where unity of purpose\r\nhad not been exhibited or the interests of nations or\r\nalliances had been placed above the universal\r\nprinciples and the rule of law, the problems remain\r\nand peace is elusive.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 14th meeting, p. 2)\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nMr. Remirez de Estenoz Barciela (Cuba)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): There can be no doubt\r\nwhatsoever that the question before us is one of the most\r\nsignificant and important of this session, a fact that has\r\nbeen forcefully confirmed by the many references to the\r\nneed for democracy in the Security Council in the\r\nstatements of almost every delegation in the recently\r\nconcluded general debate and by the impressive number of\r\ndelegations who have spoken on this subject before me.\r\nWe hope that the opinions expressed here will be\r\nuseful to the Open-ended Working Group of the General\r\nAssembly created for this issue when it resumes its work in\r\nJanuary next year. In 1994, the Working Group has held a\r\nuseful albeit general exchange of views under the wise and\r\ncapable leadership of Ambassador Samuel Insanally,\r\nPermanent Representative of Guyana, and the Permanent\r\nRepresentatives of Singapore and Finland, whom we thank\r\nfor a job well done.\r\nThe Chairman of the Movement of Non-aligned\r\nCountries has already spoken on this item on behalf of the\r\nmembers of the Movement. Allow me, first of all, to\r\nexpress my delegation’s full support of his statement, which\r\nfully reflects the spirit prevailing not only at the Jakarta\r\nSummit but also in the Ministerial Meetings of the non-\r\naligned countries that took place in Cairo and New York\r\nthis year. We feel that it is nevertheless appropriate to\r\noutline some clarifications of Cuba’s position on this issue.\r\nCuba considers that the necessary restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council has a variety of closely interwoven aspects\r\nwhich are part and parcel of the same comprehensive\r\nprocess. I am referring to the increase in the membership of\r\nthe Council on the one hand and to the strict application of\r\nthe principle of equitable geographic distribution on the\r\nother, as well as to the introduction of reforms that would\r\nenhance transparency in the Council’s work and ensure that\r\nit restrict itself to the powers and prerogatives conferred\r\nupon it by the Charter.\r\nOf course, another integral part of this complex\r\nprocess is the revitalization of the General Assembly and,\r\nabove all, the re-establishment of appropriate links between\r\nthe Assembly and the Council, making the latter duly\r\naccountable to the former, as provided for in the Charter.\r\nIt should be recalled that, in accordance with Article 24 of\r\nthe Charter, the Security Council acts on behalf of all\r\nMembers of this Organization and is accountable to them.\r\nThus, the General Assembly, as the only United Nations\r\nbody in which all Member States participate, has the right\r\nand duty to be duly informed of the activities of the\r\nCouncil and to make whatever recommendations it\r\nconsiders necessary.\r\nIn his statement, the Chairman of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement examined the historical relationship between\r\nthe way in which the total membership of the\r\nOrganization and that of the Security Council have\r\nevolved, clearly showing that the present proportions\r\nleave a great deal to be desired and must be substantially\r\nchanged.\r\nBut, in my country’s view, such change must be\r\nbased, for all categories of membership, on strict\r\napplication of the principle of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution, which must be the fundamental criterion for\r\ndetermining which countries should be members of the\r\nCouncil. Hence, Cuba supports not only a substantial\r\nincrease in non-permanent seats for the three regions of\r\ndeveloping countries, but also the granting of permanent\r\nmembership to two countries in Africa, two countries in\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, and two developing\r\ncountries in Asia, which would bring us closer to the\r\nequitable geographical distribution we advocate. In this\r\ncontext, we fully share the view of the Movement of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries that any predetermined selection\r\nthat excludes non-aligned and other developing countries\r\nwould be unacceptable.\r\nOf course, we are ready to consider thoroughly and\r\nflexibly the numerous formulas that have been proposed\r\nboth in the Open-ended Working Group of the General\r\nAssembly and during the general debate at this session,\r\nincluding the creation of new categories of Security\r\nCouncil membership. We believe that consideration of\r\nthese issues should be exhaustive and complete, and even\r\nif it takes some time we hope no one will yield to the\r\ntemptation of trying to shorten the process by seeking a\r\nruling from the General Assembly before conditions are\r\nsufficiently ripe and without having achieved the\r\nnecessary consensus on formulas for increasing the\r\nmembership of the Security Council.\r\nThat some regions are over-represented in the\r\nSecurity Council while others are under-represented is\r\nwithout question detrimental to the interests of the\r\nCouncil itself and to the Council’s authority and\r\ncredibility. In our view, in the light of the increasing\r\nimportance it has acquired in recent years, it is in the\r\nCouncil’s own interest that there should be a maximal\r\ndemocratization of its composition and structures.\r\nIncreasing the Council’s representativeness would lend it\r\ngreater legitimacy.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nBut, it must be clear that an increase in membership\r\nalone would not be sufficient to ensure this legitimacy. As\r\npart of the same negotiating package, we must also take\r\naccount of the question of the Council’s working methods\r\nand procedures. We believe that the Council would also\r\ngain practical benefits from wide-ranging reform in these\r\nimportant areas, and that it should be in the interest of\r\nCouncil members also to hold increasingly broad\r\nconsultations with non-members to keep them informed of\r\nthe Council’s activities and involve them in the work of the\r\nCouncil as much as possible. In that way, the Council\r\nwould not only be responding adequately to the continued\r\nappeals for transparency increasingly voiced in this\r\nOrganization, but would also be improving the Council’s\r\nimage in the eyes of the international community and\r\nincreasing its effectiveness by making its decisions more\r\nlegitimate and credible.\r\nWe recognize that in the past two years measures have\r\nbeen taken to improve the level of information available to\r\nStates non-members of the Council, but much remains to be\r\ndone. As measures in this area would not require Charter\r\nreforms but only changes in the operating methods of the\r\nCouncil, we think that it would be appropriate to move\r\nforward in this field simultaneously with the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group’s negotiations on equitable representation\r\non and increase in the membership of the Council.\r\nIn the Final Document it adopted during its recent\r\nministerial meeting held in Cairo, the Movement of Non-\r\nAligned Countries included a set of proposals on reform of\r\nthe functioning of the Security Council, proposals that have\r\nbeen reiterated in this debate by the Chairman of the\r\nMovement and by other colleagues. In our view, these\r\nshould be duly taken into account in this process of\r\nrestructuring the Council.\r\nOf course, a salient feature of the Council’s\r\nprocedures is the question of the anachronistic veto,\r\nwhether exercised openly or covertly. My country’s position\r\non this issue is very well known and I will not repeat it\r\nhere.\r\nAs I said before, the Charter provisions regulating the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly should be fully restored; the leading role of the\r\nAssembly should be recognized. In this context, we must\r\nrefer to the annual report of the Security Council and how\r\nit should be presented, an issue to which the non-aligned\r\ncountries have repeatedly referred and which we shall\r\naddress later in the session when the subject is dealt with\r\nat the session. Nor can we ignore the provisions of the\r\nCharter that allow the General Assembly to make\r\nrecommendations to the Council regarding its structure\r\nand methods of operation. In Cuba’s view, this important\r\naspect should be discussed until we reach solutions that\r\nare satisfactory to all.\r\nThis has been a brief summary of my country’s\r\nposition on this item; these are in full accord with those\r\nendorsed by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nWe are ready to continue working in the Assembly’s\r\nOpen-ended Working Group, and I assure members that\r\nwe will spare no effort to reach consensus solutions\r\nreflecting the vital interest of the international community\r\nin making the Security Council as democratic as possible.\r\nMr. Nobilo (Croatia): I take this opportunity to\r\nconvey my delegation’s deep appreciation to Ambassador\r\nSamuel Insanally, who, as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session, led the Working\r\nGroup on this item, and to the Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nWorking Group, Ambassador Breitenstein and\r\nAmbassador Chew. Thanks to their wise leadership, we\r\nhave made great advances on this subject.\r\nAs we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations, it is only appropriate that\r\nwe should intensify our analysis of the functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations and seriously consider possible reforms\r\nwith a view to improving its work. In this regard, the\r\npresent debate concerning the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, and related matters, is timely and\r\npertinent.\r\nThis is particularly true since the Security Council is\r\nthe organ of the United Nations which has primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security and which, in carrying out its duties, acts on\r\nbehalf of Member States. Therefore, any discussion of the\r\ncomposition and functioning of the Security Council is of\r\nextreme importance and should be approached with all the\r\nnecessary gravity and seriousness and in a manner which\r\ntakes into consideration global interests and not just the\r\nindividual interests of States.\r\nIn terms of its composition, permanent membership\r\nof the Security Council should not be limited to the\r\ncoalition of the victors of the Second World War or to the\r\nnuclear club of the super-Powers. New political and\r\neconomic realities must be taken into account and due\r\nregard must be given to ensuring a proper geographical\r\nbalance as well as to the increase in the membership of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nthe United Nations. Due to their firm adherence to\r\ndemocratic principles and to their active and valuable\r\ninvolvement in the interest of maintaining international\r\npeace and security, Croatia is of the opinion that Germany\r\nand Japan deserve to be permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nFurthermore, we hold that developing countries should\r\nbe better represented in the Security Council, not only as a\r\nresult of their number and broad geographical distribution,\r\nbut because of the political and economic influence of\r\nmany of these countries and the constructive role which\r\nthey have played in international affairs, including peace-\r\nkeeping. Serious consideration should be given to granting\r\npermanent member status to one or more of these countries\r\nor to establishing a system whereby certain regionally\r\ninfluential States should be allowed to sit in the Security\r\nCouncil more often. Of course, Croatia would respect the\r\ndecision reached by the developing States as to how they\r\nprefer to be better represented in the Council.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to reiterate the need to keep\r\nthe interests of small States in mind when considering the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council. In keeping with the\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality of States, we are of the\r\nopinion that a mechanism should be established by which\r\nsmall States are guaranteed a voice in the Council through\r\na balanced rotation of non-permanent seats.\r\nAny enlargement of the Council must be done in such\r\na way as not to impair the efficiency of its work. It is\r\nobvious that the Security Council, regardless of its size,\r\nmay be inefficient if there is no political will to make\r\nimportant decisions or if action is blocked by a veto or\r\nthreatened veto by one or more of its permanent members.\r\nHowever, practical experience leads us to conclude that any\r\nlarge increase in the membership of the Council could lead\r\nto inefficiency in its work by overloading it with the ballast\r\nof oversized bureaucracy. Therefore, it is important to\r\nincrease membership by an amount by which the efficiency\r\nof the Council will not be sacrificed in order to make it\r\nmore representative. In this light, it is our opinion that the\r\nincrease in membership should be done in such a way as to\r\nensure that the total number of members of the Security\r\nCouncil does not exceed 25.\r\nIn addition to the issue of the composition of the\r\nSecurity Council, other important matters relating to the\r\nwork of the Council deserve full consideration. Among\r\nthese is the issue of the power of the veto. The Republic of\r\nCroatia wishes to reiterate its general position that there\r\nshould be a limitation of the right and practice of the veto.\r\nHowever, since it is unlikely that the power of veto will\r\nsoon be abolished, the Republic of Croatia is of the view\r\nthat the proposal of requiring at least two vetoes to be\r\ncast in order to nullify a Security Council resolution\r\ndeserves serious consideration. This proposal is even\r\nmore appropriate in a Security Council with an increased\r\nnumber of permanent members.\r\nTransparency in the work of the Security Council is\r\nalso of great concern for the Republic of Croatia. While\r\nwe applaud recent improvements which have increased\r\nthe transparency of the Council, it is our firm opinion that\r\nmuch more can be done in this regard. A better method\r\nof communicating information on the deliberations in the\r\ninformal consultations should be devised. Also, we view\r\nwith favour the proposal that documents made available\r\nto the Security Council, as well as summaries of informal\r\nconsultations, should be made available to interested\r\nMember States.\r\nCroatia also supports improvement in the\r\ncooperation between the only body in which all Member\r\nStates are represented — the General Assembly — and\r\nthe Security Council. In this regard, regular briefings by\r\nthe President of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly would be helpful.\r\nMy delegation also fully agrees that there is a need\r\nfor greater consultation by the Security Council with\r\ntroop-contributing countries, with third countries affected\r\nby sanctions and with States situated in regions\r\nexperiencing conflict. However, we also wish to stress the\r\nneed for greater consultations by the Council with troop-\r\nhosting States — that is, States which have allowed\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping forces on their territory —\r\nas these are among the States which are most affected by\r\nCouncil decisions.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to address the issue of\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council. The Republic of\r\nCroatia is situated in a crisis region which has so far been\r\nthe source of more than 70 Security Council\r\nresolutions — all in the last three years. Yet many of\r\nthese resolutions have not been implemented or have only\r\nbeen partially implemented. We wish to stress that for the\r\nSecurity Council to be effective it must ensure that its\r\nresolutions are fully implemented — not only in our\r\nregion, but in general. Otherwise, not only may there be\r\na loss of credibility of the Security Council and the\r\nUnited Nations, but the very principles of allowable\r\ninternational behaviour which have been formed in the\r\nlast 50 years, and the very values which the international\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\ncommunity has committed itself to, may seriously be at\r\nstake.\r\nMr. Valencia Rodriguez (Ecuador) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): The question now before us has been\r\nthoroughly discussed by the Movement of Non-Aligned\r\nCountries, of which Ecuador is a member. I wish to add a\r\nfew brief comments.\r\nFirst, may I convey my delegation’s congratulations to\r\nAmbassadors Insanally, Breitenstein and Chew, the\r\nChairman and Vice-Chairmen respectively of the Working\r\nGroup established by the General Assembly to address this\r\nquestion. The work done by the Working Group permitted\r\na broad-ranging exchange of views aimed at ensuring better\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council in such a way that its\r\nactivities, on behalf of all Members of the Organization,\r\nmay strengthen its credibility and reaffirm its legitimacy.\r\nA broad range of helpful proposals have been made in\r\nthe course of the Group’s work. We hope that during this\r\nsession we can build consensus on the fundamental issues\r\nso that the decisions taken at the end of the negotiating\r\nprocess may receive the support of all delegations.\r\nEcuador supports the initiatives aimed at ensuring\r\ngreater transparency in the work of the Council, including\r\nestablishing a system of regular consultations with States\r\naffected by a given conflict, with troop-contributing States\r\nand with regional groups, as well as the establishment of\r\nmachinery allowing for a more fluid relationship between\r\nthe Assembly and the Council, so that the Council’s\r\nactivities may reflect the majority view of the Organization.\r\nThe practice of holding informal consultations behind\r\nclosed door tends to diminish trust in the activities of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nAs part of this endeavour to improve the Council’s\r\nprocedures, it is essential to address the question of the\r\nveto, a mechanism that we have repeatedly repudiated as\r\nanti-democratic. I refer members to document A/48/264 at\r\npage 36. Other delegations have already discussed in detail\r\nthe historical factors underlying the adoption of that\r\npractice and the reasons that now prompt us to restrict it\r\nand eventually abolish it. A number of different formulas\r\nhave been offered, ranging from determining issues on\r\nwhich the veto could not be used to requiring that the veto\r\nbe exercised only if two States that were entitled to do so\r\ncast vetoes.\r\nI am sure that the broad range of the proposals that\r\nhave been made will enable the Working Group to find\r\nacceptable formulas which will strike a balance between\r\nthe rights of the permanent members and the pressing\r\nneed for the Council to act in strict conformity with\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter so that national interests,\r\nhowever powerful, are properly coordinated with the\r\ncommon aims of mankind represented here.\r\nEcuador’s legal tradition is the same as that of the\r\nrest of Latin America. It is a tradition that regards law as\r\nthe basis for relations between States. Thus we are\r\nconcerned at the trend that has developed in practice in\r\nthe Council of widening, at its discretion, the powers\r\nvested in it by the Charter. The argument that the Council\r\nis a political body cannot exempt it from adhering to the\r\nnorms of international law, particularly now when there\r\nis an increasing number of inter-State conflicts and many\r\nchanges on the world scene. For this reason Ecuador is\r\ninclined to favour the proposals that the Security Council\r\nshould act under constitutional control, in conformity with\r\nthe mechanisms that are regarded as appropriate.\r\nThe Assembly will be called upon at the proper time\r\nto take decisions on the way in which the Council works\r\nand on its enlargement. Ecuador recognizes and supports\r\nthe legitimate aspirations of countries such as Germany,\r\nBrazil and Japan and countries of Asia and Africa to be\r\nrepresented on the Council as permanent members. These\r\naspirations should be considered in the context of the\r\nneed to respect equitable geographical distribution for all\r\nregions and the imbalance that currently exists in favour\r\nof one region, both among the permanent and among the\r\nnon-permanent members. My delegation is extremely\r\nflexible in this regard and has considered with interest the\r\nalternative proposals presented by various delegations, for\r\nexample Italy, which we believe can pave the way to the\r\ndesired consensus.\r\nEcuador believes that the necessary reorganization of\r\nthe Council cannot be carried out simply by increasing\r\nthe number of its permanent or non-permanent members.\r\nWe are convinced that if negotiations go on\r\nsimultaneously on the questions of the functioning of the\r\nCouncil and the enlargement of its membership, and if a\r\ncomprehensive approach is taken that avoids reducing the\r\ndebate to mere arithmetics or to an attempt to solve\r\nproblems in the short term, the Working Group will be\r\nable to adopt changes that will lay the foundation for a\r\nSecurity Council equipped to tackle the difficult\r\nchallenges it will face in the immediate future.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): My delegation\r\nassociates itself with the tributes paid to Ambassador\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nInsanally, Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nthe Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council, and its two\r\nVice-Chairmen, Ambassador Breitenstein of Finland and\r\nAmbassador Chew Tai Soo of Singapore.\r\nWe welcome the recommendation that the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group continue its work, taking into account\r\nviews expressed at the forty-ninth session, and submit a\r\nreport to the General Assembly before the end of the\r\nsession.\r\nOur priority objective remains to forge a meaningful\r\nconsensus for much-needed reform and restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council in a comprehensive manner that would\r\nmake it more representative, credible and legitimate;\r\nstrengthen its relations with other organs, especially the\r\nGeneral Assembly; and improve its methods of working\r\nand procedures so that it would be more efficient, effective,\r\ntransparent and accountable.\r\nOver the past year we have entered into a sustained\r\nprocess of dialogue and discussion on a progressively\r\nsubstantive basis, highlighting the importance attached by\r\nMember States to this issue. Background papers have been\r\ncompiled by the Secretariat on views expressed in writing\r\nor orally since the forty-seventh and forty-eighth sessions\r\nand on substantive discussions on six cluster issues from\r\nMarch to May 1994. Since then, follow-up discussions in\r\nJune, the non-paper of the President of the General\r\nAssembly, views expressed by Indonesia as Chairman of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, and statements by individual\r\ncountries at the forty-ninth session have all provided a\r\nconsidered body of opinion on this subject-matter.\r\nBangladesh’s viewpoints have also been articulated in\r\nthe course of this exercise. We would briefly like to\r\nhighlight the following.\r\nFirst and foremost, there is palpable recognition of the\r\nneed for change in the Security Council to make it conform\r\nto a radically transformed world community and world\r\nsituation. The approach, in our opinion, must be holistic\r\nand comprehensive in nature, touching on both its\r\nmembership and its mandate.\r\nSecondly, there seems to be a universal convergence\r\nof views that the membership of the Council should be\r\nenlarged. However, differences still persist on the scope,\r\ncomposition and nature of such an expansion. A central\r\ndilemma relates to increasing the permanent membership.\r\nWe are confronted with balancing conflicting principles\r\ntouching on the sovereign equality of Member States and\r\nthe democratization of the United Nations, and the Non-\r\nAligned Movement’s considered position opposed to the\r\nperpetuation of current inequalities through the creation of\r\nnew centres of privilege. Indeed the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement’s position on the Council’s decision-making\r\nprocess has been consistently directed at questioning the\r\ncontinued relevance of the veto, its possible abolition or\r\nat least the imposition of restrictions on its use.\r\nBangladesh believes that the continued privileged status\r\nof permanent members is a matter of concern and that the\r\nobjective should be to focus on limiting or removing this\r\npreserve over time. We believe, however, that if a clear\r\nconsensus was to emerge in support of the expansion of\r\nthe ranks of permanent members, taking into account the\r\neffectiveness and credibility of the Council in the face of\r\nnew and emerging political and economic realities, we\r\nwould need to take a much harder and more stringent\r\nlook at the criteria and modalities for the selection of new\r\nincumbents. Objective criteria would need to be worked\r\nout above and beyond the criteria laid down under Article\r\n23, paragraph 1, of the Charter and must, inter alia,\r\ninclude a country’s capacity to serve and to contribute\r\ntowards maintaining peace and security; its commitment\r\nto democratic ideals; its record in the area of human\r\nrights; and, above all, its compliance with internationally\r\naccepted covenants and the resolutions of the United\r\nNations. A major factor is that any such recognition as a\r\npermanent member must be achieved in conformity with\r\nthe Charter and through consensus and the agreement of\r\nall Member States.\r\nOn the issue of the size of the Council, Bangladesh\r\nfully supports an expansion consistent with the increase\r\nin overall membership of the United Nations and\r\nconforming to the broadly established mathematical ratio\r\nof 10 per cent of the total United Nations membership.\r\nWe believe that the base criterion of the Council’s\r\ncomposition should be equitable geographical distribution,\r\ntaking into account current membership patterns in terms\r\nof regional distribution encompassing Europe as a whole,\r\nAsia, Africa and Latin America, as well as the skewed\r\nimpact on regional distribution of the five permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nOn broader issues, there is a wide convergence of\r\nviews on improving the working methods and procedures\r\nof the Council, including institutional competence,\r\ntransparency, accountability, efficiency, responsiveness\r\nand timely and well-informed decision-making consistent\r\nwith the support of all Member States. Some important\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\npositive steps have already been taken, and further\r\nproposals can supplement this process.\r\nAgenda item 120\r\nFinancing of the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nEl Salvador\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/49/503)\r\nThe President: If there is no proposal under rule 66\r\nof the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General\r\nAssembly decides not to discuss the report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee that is before the Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Statements will therefore be limited to\r\nexplanations of vote.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendations of the Fifth Committee have been made\r\nclear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant\r\nofficial records.\r\nMay I remind members that under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401 the General Assembly agreed that\r\n“When the same draft resolution is considered\r\nin a Main Committee and in plenary meeting,\r\na delegation should, as far as possible, explain\r\nits vote only once, that is, either in the\r\nCommittee or in plenary meeting unless that\r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is\r\ndifferent from its vote in the Committee.”\r\nMay I also remind delegations that, again in\r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 34/401,\r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that we\r\nare going to proceed to take a decision in the same\r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft\r\ndecision recommended by the Fifth Committee in\r\nparagraph 6 of its report (A/49/503). The draft decision\r\nwas adopted by the Fifth Committee without a vote. May\r\nI consider that the Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe President: We have concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 120.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12:55 p.m.\r\n24\r\n"
