(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I should\r\nlike to consult delegations on the proposed format regarding\r\nthe commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations Fund for Population Activities, to be held\r\non Thursday, 20 October 1994, in the morning.\r\nAfter the opening of the meeting the Assembly would\r\nhear a statement by the Secretary-General. Next, the\r\nAssembly would hear statements by the Chairmen of the\r\nfive regional groups and by the representative of the host\r\ncountry, as decided by the Assembly at its 3rd meeting, on\r\n23 September 1994, regarding observances and\r\ncommemorative meetings. The Assembly would also hear\r\nstatements by the Chairmen of the Group of 77 and of the\r\nEuropean Union, the President of the Executive Board of\r\nthe United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the\r\nChairman of the Group of Nordic Countries and the\r\nChairman of the Second Committee.\r\nI understand that interested delegations will submit a\r\ndraft resolution in advance of the meeting for consideration\r\non that date.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves of this\r\nformat?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\nshould like to request delegations to cooperate by making\r\nan effort to keep their statements under the 15-minute\r\nlimit, as decided by the Assembly.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\nshould like to seek the cooperation of delegations on the\r\nmatter of punctuality. I remind delegations that\r\npunctuality is of the utmost importance in ensuring the\r\neffective and orderly organization of the work of the\r\nAssembly and in achieving economies for the United\r\nNations.\r\nI strongly endorse the practical suggestions made at\r\nprevious sessions that each delegation designate someone\r\nto be present at the scheduled time. I genuinely hope that\r\nall delegations will cooperate.\r\nAgenda item 33 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): Before\r\ncalling on the first speaker I should like to inform the\r\nAssembly that the representative of Nigeria has expressed\r\na desire to participate in the debate on this item.\r\n1\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nInasmuch as the list of speakers was closed on\r\nThursday, 13 October, at noon, may I ask the Assembly\r\nwhether there is any objection to the inclusion of this\r\ndelegation in the list of speakers?\r\nI see none. Nigeria is therefore included in the list.\r\nMr. Dimitrov (Bulgaria): The Bulgarian delegation\r\njoins all the others that have expressed appreciation of the\r\nuntiring efforts of Ambassador Samuel Insanally, who so\r\nskilfully chaired the deliberations of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group established pursuant to General Assembly\r\nresolution 48/26. I should like also to thank the\r\nVice-Chairmen of the Group, Ambassador Breitenstein and\r\nAmbassador Chew, for their remarkable work.\r\nBulgaria shares the opinion that the ongoing discussion\r\non reform of the Security Council in the framework of the\r\nOpen-ended Group is highly constructive and substantive.\r\nWe are ready to make an active contribution to this\r\nimportant exercise, which is focused on the very future of\r\nthe Organization. It is our strong belief that the new spirit\r\nof cooperation prevailing in the international community\r\nwill make it possible to reach consensus solutions, enabling\r\nthe Security Council to meet the challenges of the new\r\ntimes in the most effective and efficient way.\r\nAn enlargement of the Security Council should aim to\r\nenhance its capacity in the sphere of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We support the search for\r\nan appropriate balance between the need to increase the size\r\nof the Council, owing to the growth in the number of States\r\nMembers of the United Nations over the years, and the\r\nneed for effectiveness and efficiency in its work.\r\nWe are of the opinion that this balance could be\r\nachieved if the Council were enlarged to a number in the\r\nlow twenties. In this process, it will be necessary to ensure\r\nthat the increase in the number of non-permanent members\r\npreserves the ratio, on the one hand, between permanent\r\nand non-permanent members and, on the other hand,\r\nbetween the regional groups.\r\nIn practical terms, this would mean ensuring that\r\nStates that carry considerable weight in international\r\npolitical and economic life - for example, Germany and\r\nJapan - as well as other countries that are influential in\r\nregional or global terms, could assume the responsibility of\r\npermanent status in the Council. An additional\r\nnon-permanent seat should be allocated to the Eastern\r\nEuropean Group. In this connection, it is appropriate to\r\nremind representatives that this regional group has exactly\r\ndoubled its membership since the latest enlargement of\r\nthe Council in 1965, while the membership of the United\r\nNations over the same period has increased from 113 to\r\n184.\r\nWe welcome the Council’s recent steps to improve\r\nits working methods - steps intended to increase\r\ntransparency and to secure stronger involvement by\r\nnon-member States. This momentum should be\r\nmaintained through mechanisms designed to take into\r\naccount, at an early stage of the decision-making process,\r\nthe positions of neighbouring countries and of other\r\ninterested States. The question of possible contributions\r\nby regional organizations, under appropriate arrangements,\r\nshould also be taken into account.\r\nThe need for such consultations is felt most strongly\r\nwhen economic sanctions and similar preventive and\r\nenforcement measures are being considered. This process\r\nshould also include an advance detailed evaluation of any\r\nnegative effects on the economies of neighbouring\r\ncountries and should define the ways and means of\r\ndealing with them.\r\nAdditionally, it has become clear that there is a\r\npressing need for an increase in the transparency of the\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council sanctions committees,\r\nsince their work is of special importance for a number of\r\nStates that have already assumed heavier burdens in\r\nimplementing decisions of the Council. It would only be\r\nfair to devise mechanisms to assist these countries in their\r\ndifficult situations, starting the imperative need for a\r\ngreater exchange of information, regular and/or ad hoc\r\neffective briefings on the deliberations of committee\r\nmeetings, and holding open meetings or allowing the\r\nStates concerned to participate as observers whenever\r\nsuch participation is warranted by the discussion of issues\r\nof vital importance for their economies.\r\nOther measures to improve the transparency of the\r\nwork of the Council might include briefings by the\r\nCouncil President or his or her representative on the most\r\nimportant elements of the discussions during informal\r\nconsultations.\r\nRegular consultations with troop contributors and\r\nother States concerned should be institutionalized as a\r\ncomponent of the decision-making process on peace-\r\nkeeping operations, especially when the Council is\r\nconsidering changes in their mandates and composition.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm my country’s\r\nreadiness to continue to contribute actively to the important\r\nprocess of adapting the Organization to the new challenges\r\nconfronting it, of which the reform of the Security Council\r\nis a major element.\r\nMr. Erdenechuluun (Mongolia): My delegation fully\r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered earlier on this\r\nagenda item by the representative of Indonesia, on behalf\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, and endorses the points\r\nraised therein. The purpose of my statement is to highlight\r\nthe issues of particular interest to my delegation and to\r\npoint to the ideas we consider important to bear in mind in\r\nour future work.\r\nWe believe that the Open-ended Working Group did\r\na commendable job over the last year, considering the\r\nsensitive and delicate nature of the issues discussed. My\r\ndelegation wishes to express its appreciation to\r\nAmbassador Insanally, Chairman of the Working Group,\r\nand to Ambassadors Wilhelm Breitenstein of Finland and\r\nChew Tai Soo of Singapore, the two Vice-Chairmen, for\r\ntheir skill and discretion in guiding our work.\r\nA great number of issues were covered and even more\r\nideas exchanged during the meetings of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group. With the invaluable support of the\r\nSecretariat, the Chairman produced several papers outlining\r\nthe positions of States, points on which there was\r\nconvergence of views and others on which there was\r\ndisagreement. By and large, the Working Group succeeded,\r\nin our view, in accumulating a wealth of ideas on how to\r\napproach and execute this centrally important task of\r\nensuring equitable representation on and an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council.\r\nNone the less, the report (A/48/47) of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group to the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly reflects neither the lively discussion that took\r\nplace in the Group’s meetings nor the wealth of proposals\r\nand ideas submitted by the delegations. Reporting to the\r\nGeneral Assembly on points of both agreement and\r\ndisagreement within the Working Group would have been\r\nhelpful, in our view, in generating more constructive and\r\ndetailed discussion at this session of the General Assembly,\r\nas well as in identifying priorities for the Working Group\r\nto address next year.\r\nIn our view, the most important achievement of the\r\nWorking Group lies in its recording \"a convergence of\r\nviews that the membership of the Security Council should\r\nbe enlarged\" and that \"there was also agreement that the\r\nscope and nature of such enlargement require further\r\ndiscussion\" (A/48/47, para. 8).\r\nAnother valuable point of agreement which, to our\r\nregret, was not reflected in the report, was the adoption\r\nby the Working Group of a package-deal approach\r\nproviding for the inclusive and thorough consideration of\r\nmutually interrelated issues of increase in the membership\r\nand changes in the working methods and procedures of\r\nthe Security Council. A mere enlargement of the Council\r\nby a few seats without adequate improvements in its\r\nworking methods and procedures will not suffice.\r\nWe understand full well that an expanded Council\r\nshould, by necessity, reflect the emergence of new\r\nimportant actors on the international scene, such as Japan\r\nand Germany. By the same token, it should be\r\nemphasized that adequate representation of the non-\r\naligned and other developing countries in the permanent-\r\nmember category must be secured.\r\nMongolia continues to advocate a moderate increase\r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent membership of\r\nthe Security Council. We feel that a 25-26 strong\r\nmembership could make the Council a body well\r\nrepresentative of the world community and yet small\r\nenough to act quickly and efficiently.\r\nIn our understanding, the need to ensure equitable\r\ngeographical representation in the Security Council is an\r\nimportant driving force for this whole exercise. Here,\r\nsimilarly, we observe with satisfaction a growing\r\nacknowledgement that Africa, Asia and Latin America\r\nshould be given larger representation in the restructured\r\nCouncil, including in the permanent-member category.\r\nMore importantly, however, we must secure a proper and\r\nfair distribution of seats within the regional groups so that\r\nevery State, regardless of its size and resources, would\r\nhave a fair chance to serve its term in the Council and\r\ncontribute to the common cause. The idea of introducing\r\na mechanism of constituencies in the Security Council\r\nmerits further consideration, as it would facilitate proper\r\nrepresentation of small- and medium-size States in the\r\nCouncil and, above all, help provide greater transparency,\r\naccountability and representativeness in its work.\r\nThe question of decision-making in the Security\r\nCouncil is another issue of paramount importance. We\r\nshare the position of many delegations that in the long\r\nrun the veto prerogative should be abolished altogether as\r\nan undemocratic institution running contrary to the\r\nunderlying principle of sovereign equality of Member\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nStates. In this context, the option of not granting the right\r\nto veto to the new permanent members in the restructured\r\nSecurity Council would, in our opinion, be a logical first\r\nstep towards the abolishment of this institution. We also\r\nnoted with interest a number of ideas aimed at limiting the\r\napplication of veto rights in the future Security Council and\r\nexpect the Working Group to deliberate on them with due\r\ncare and attention. Here I wish to reiterate our firm belief\r\nthat the rule of obligatory abstention in the Security\r\nCouncil, contained in Article 27 (3) of the Charter, should\r\nbe revived in unequivocal terms, and ways should be found\r\nto ensure that this rule is adhered to in the restructured\r\nCouncil.\r\nMy delegation supports the Working Group’s\r\nrecommendation that it continue its work during the forty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly. We hope that on\r\nthe basis of its work in 1994 the Working Group will be\r\nable to engage in an in-depth discussion of the various\r\nproposals and ideas before it with a view to reaching a\r\nbalanced consensus sooner rather than later.\r\nMr. Cardenas (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Almost one year has elapsed since the General\r\nAssembly decided to create, through resolution 48/26, an\r\nOpen-ended Working Group to consider all aspects of the\r\nquestion of the possible increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and related matters.\r\nThis Working Group held active and effective\r\nmeetings this year, and in this context I should like to\r\nhighlight the excellent job done by the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session, Mr. Insanally,\r\nas well as the Vice-Chairmen of the Group, Mr. Chew Tai\r\nSoo of Singapore and Wilhelm Breitenstein of Finland.\r\nMy delegation had an opportunity to take an active\r\npart in the various deliberations of this Working Group, as\r\nwell as in the various informal consultations conducted by\r\nits Chairman.\r\nThe position of the Argentine Government, as already\r\nexpressed in its response to the request of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/48/264), was recently reiterated in the statement\r\nmade by President Carlos Menem on Tuesday, 27\r\nSeptember 1994, in the Assembly. It can be summarized\r\nas follows.\r\nFirst, the Republic of Argentina attaches special\r\nimportance to the process of reform of the Security Council\r\nwhich has been started. The primary objective of this\r\nprocess should be the strengthening of the Security Council\r\nby achieving greater effectiveness and transparency in its\r\nfunctioning and making it more representative of the\r\nStates Members of the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, any expansion of the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council should be undertaken with care and\r\nprudence, and should at all times respect the principle of\r\nthe sovereign equality of States.\r\nThirdly, the possible increase in the number of\r\nmembers of the Security Council must be effected on the\r\nbasis of the criteria contained in Article 23 of the United\r\nNations Charter, criteria which we deem to be sound.\r\nFourthly, the Argentine Republic advocates a limited\r\nincrease in non-permanent seats - I repeat, non-permanent\r\nseats - and the elimination of the clause which now bars\r\nimmediate re-election.\r\nThis, as we see it, would enable those States that are\r\nin a position - and desire - to make a contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security to have\r\nseats in the Security Council more frequently. It would\r\nalso avoid causing regional imbalances that might\r\nunjustifiably alter the historical system whereby some\r\nStates traditionally alternate their membership of the\r\nCouncil, as could be precisely the case of the Argentine\r\nRepublic.\r\nFifthly, greater transparency and representativeness\r\nof the Security Council could be achieved by better\r\nparticipation of the members on issues that are of specific\r\ninterest to them. This could be done in two ways; first,\r\nby means of greater procedural transparency in the work\r\nof the Council, especially in informal consultations, and,\r\nsecondly by establishing mechanisms that would allow for\r\na relationship between the Members of the United Nations\r\nand the Security Council.\r\nIn this connection, the Argentine Republic, which is\r\nat present a non-permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil, has already submitted an initiative, together with\r\nNew Zealand, designed to establish a procedure to ensure\r\nregular and predictable dialogue between the Secretariat\r\nand the troop-contributing countries when the mandates of\r\npeace-keeping operations are being reviewed or renewed.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank Member States for the\r\nvaluable support we have been receiving regarding this\r\ninitiative. It encourages us to pursue it.\r\nMany aspects of this subject that have been\r\ndiscussed in our Working Group do not require amending\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Many of those aspects,\r\nwhich could be considered as procedural but which have to\r\ndo with the transparency and representativeness of the\r\nSecurity Council, are within the Council’s own competence.\r\nIn this context, I should like to highlight the work\r\ndone by the Security Council Working Group on\r\nProcedures and Documentation. In the last two years many\r\nchanges have been introduced which have benefited the\r\nmembership at large. However, we believe that there is\r\nstill much progress to be made.\r\nIn this connection my delegation, as a member of the\r\nSecurity Council for the 1994-1995 term, is taking an active\r\npart in its work and has for several months, together with\r\nother delegations, advocated the consideration of the\r\nprocedural issues that have been identified by the\r\nAssembly’s Open-ended Working Group.\r\nThis first stage of the Working Group’s activity should\r\nenable us to draw certain conclusions that would permit this\r\nprocess to continue effectively and usefully. To that end,\r\nlet me refer to two points: first, the purpose of our future\r\ndiscussion and, secondly, the way to achieve that purpose.\r\nRegarding the purpose of our discussion, we feel that\r\nwe ought to focus on those points where there is clear-cut\r\nconsensus - I repeat, clear-cut consensus - on the part of\r\nthe membership. In this connection, we feel it would be\r\nvery helpful to use the informal working paper submitted\r\nby the Chairman of the Working Group on 20 May last. It\r\nproperly identifies the points of agreement.\r\nWith respect to the course of action to be followed,\r\nmy delegation supports extending the mandate of the\r\nWorking Group, preferably under your chairmanship,\r\nMr. President, and with the same Vice-Chairmen.\r\nAs far as the modalities are concerned, we believe\r\nthat, to ensure transparency and effectiveness, a proper\r\nbalance must be struck between plenary meetings, and\r\nconsultations in smaller groups.\r\nI should like through you, Mr. President, to assure the\r\nAssembly that it can count on my delegation’s full\r\ncooperation during the new session of the Working Group.\r\nMr. Khani (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): The General Assembly has been considering\r\nthe item entitled \"Question of equitable representation on\r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council\"\r\nsince its thirty-fourth session. Although consideration of\r\nthe item receded somewhat, it was resumed at the forty-\r\neighth session. Many speakers have attached particular\r\nimportance to our debate on the item. Such attention to\r\nthe item is warranted in view of the importance of the\r\nsubject, and of the tasks mandated to the Security Council\r\nby the Charter with regard to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWith the approaching fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, significant questions are bound to be\r\nasked about the achievements of this Organization and the\r\nobstacles it still faces. One of the most important of\r\nthose is the question of increasing the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and the need to arrive at a formula for\r\nequitable representation therein. Such questions arise\r\nfrom the fact that the present composition of the Council,\r\nwhich took shape in the wake of the Second World War,\r\nhas become rather anachronistic at a time when the\r\nOrganization’s membership is fourfold what it was at the\r\ntime of its inception.\r\nMany regional groups and Member States have\r\nworked diligently on this matter and have focused on the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making procedures which must be\r\nstudied as an integral part of an overall plan.\r\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country, in\r\nhis statement before the General Assembly, on 3 October\r\n1994, had this to say on the matter:\r\n\"It seems that none of the Member States\r\nobjects in principle to the idea of introducing\r\nreforms to the United Nations, including the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council’s membership.\r\nHowever, the question that could take years before\r\nany agreement is reached on it is that which relates\r\nto the nature of the required reforms, the criteria for\r\nchoosing the new members of the Security Council\r\nand, first and foremost, the right of veto: whether to\r\nexpand it or abolish it altogether from the Charter\".\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-\r\nninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 14th meeting, [p.\r\n17])\r\nIncreasing the membership of the Security Council\r\nwould help strengthen democracy within the United\r\nNations and enable the Security Council to fully discharge\r\nits main responsibilities, as this would lead to strict\r\nrespect for the two principles of the sovereign co-equality\r\nof States and of equitable geographical representation on\r\nthe Council.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nAny reform of the Security Council must reflect the\r\nconcerns of all the States Members of the United Nations\r\nwhose number now stands at 184 and two-thirds of which\r\nStates were not involved in the drafting of the Charter. The\r\nSecurity Council is the only United Nations body whose\r\ncriteria for membership were set out in the Charter.\r\nTherefore, enabling the developing countries to make an\r\neffective contribution to restructuring the United Nations\r\nand to ensuring that they have their democratic share in the\r\nSecurity Council would be an expression of democracy in\r\nour Organization, especially that the developing nations\r\nconstitute 80 per cent of the world’s population.\r\nThe countries of the Mon-aligned Movement have\r\nalways emphasized the need for democratizing international\r\nrelations and have worked diligently for the achievement of\r\nthe Movement’s goals of equitable representation and\r\nincreased Security Council membership.\r\nMy delegation believes that the Security Council\r\nshould be reformed and restructured in response to the\r\nmajor changes that have taken place on the international\r\narena and that such reform and restructuring should include\r\na comprehensive review of the Council’s methods of work\r\nand decision-making procedures.\r\nIn conclusion, we must point out that reform is not an\r\nend in itself but a necessary means of facing up to the\r\nchanges that have been enfolding in the world since the end\r\nof the cold war. To face up to the challenges inherent in\r\nsuch changes, there is a need for the cooperation of the\r\nentire international community if we are to look forward to\r\na better future and ensure respect for the principles of\r\nsovereignty, democracy and transparency in decision-\r\nmaking.\r\nMr. Tejera Paris (Venezuela) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Venezuela has on four occasions had the\r\nprivilege of being a member of the Security Council. That\r\nexperience certainly served to reaffirm our belief that any\r\nchange that might take place in the membership of the\r\nCouncil should aim at increased regional participation and\r\nalso at improving the effectiveness of the Council.\r\nAll Member States, including many of those who\r\njoined the Organization in recent years, can appreciate -\r\nthrough their own experience or that of their respective\r\nregions - the complex and extremely difficult nature of the\r\nwork of the Council and, in particular, the complexity of\r\nthe most recent conflicts and crises that the Security\r\nCouncil has had to deal with. The Council has made every\r\neffort to devote the required attention to these conflicts and\r\nhas tried new, delicate and complicated solutions to some\r\nof them, sometimes stretching its powers to the limit.\r\nAlmost three years after the summit meeting of the\r\nSecurity Council, which began this new stage in the life\r\nof our Organization, the opportunity now presents itself\r\nto strike a balance, this time around with the benefit of\r\nthe views of all the Member States. The General\r\nAssembly, in agreeing to consider equitable\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council and an increase in\r\nits membership, has expressed a desire for change.\r\nVenezuela would like to thank Ambassador Rudolph\r\nInsanally of Guyana for the manner in which he presided\r\nover the Working Group which last year considered the\r\n\"Question of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council\". Its meetings\r\nwere most useful in assessing existing prospects and in\r\nbeginning to identify points of agreement. We are\r\npleased to see acknowledged the need to ensure that\r\nrepresentation in the Council must be in line with that of\r\nan Organization whose membership has grown so\r\nsignificantly. This expansion, which is unreservedly\r\nsupported by Venezuela, must now be defined in terms of\r\nformat and scope.\r\nVenezuela believes that any expansion of the\r\nCouncil should be guided by the principles of the\r\nsovereign equality of States and of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation, and, to this end, Venezuela supports the\r\nexpansion of the number of non-permanent seats.\r\nThe Government of Venezuela believes that any\r\nincrease in the number of permanent seats must take into\r\naccount the Latin American and Caribbean region, whose\r\ncontributions to international peace and security are\r\npraiseworthy from whatever standpoint they are\r\nconsidered. The President of Venezuela referred\r\nexplicitly to this issue in his statement before this\r\nAssembly on 30 September last.\r\nAt the same time, Venezuela would like to reiterate\r\nthat the equality of the rights and responsibilities of States\r\nrequires a revision of the power of veto. We have\r\nsupported that principle since we became founding\r\nMembers of the Organization in 1945. Present\r\ncircumstances make it clear, however, that the\r\nextraordinary veto power is no longer in keeping with its\r\noriginal goals. The most recent practice of the Security\r\nCouncil, and in particular of its permanent members,\r\nseems to confirm this as well.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nWe believe that the conditions are ripe for reform in\r\nthe political and institutional arena. The Security Council,\r\non the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization,\r\ncan and must adapt to the new international reality.\r\nWe trust that the Working Group will, in due course,\r\nresume its work and that it will begin identifying the\r\nspecific characteristics that the Security Council must\r\npossess if it is to deal with future challenges. We offer our\r\nfull cooperation to this end.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): Before\r\nwe continue our consideration of this item, I should like\r\nonce again ask for the cooperation of States in being\r\npunctual. I must confess that during the general debate\r\nthere were some delays in beginning our meetings. That\r\nwas inevitable because of the large number of Heads of\r\nState and other officials visiting the Secretary-General and\r\nme. But the general debate is now over, and we should try\r\nto make an extra effort to be on time. At any rate, it is my\r\nfirm intention to begin our meetings at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.,\r\nrespectively - not a minute later.\r\nMr. Hayes (Ireland): Allow me at the outset, Sir, to\r\npersonally renew the warm words of congratulation and\r\nwelcome to you, as President of the General Assembly, that\r\nwere expressed by my Minister in the general debate a few\r\nweeks ago. I should also like to express our thanks to your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Insanally, for the excellent job he\r\ndid as President of the last session.\r\nThe same Minister to whom I have just referred - the\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Ireland -\r\nadverted to Security Council reform in his statements in the\r\ngeneral debate at both the forty-eighth and forty-ninth\r\nsessions of the General Assembly. Last month he\r\nmentioned it as one of seven points on which he believed\r\nthere should be priority action in our efforts to build a\r\nUnited Nations capable of meeting the challenges of the\r\nnew era. Both then and last year he stressed that the\r\nSecurity Council should be more representative of the\r\nincreased general membership, reflective of the changes in\r\neconomic and political relations and more responsive to the\r\nneeds of the general membership.\r\nThese are the broad ambits of our policy aimed at\r\nensuring that there is a sense of common purpose between\r\nthe Council and the overall United Nations membership, on\r\nwhose behalf the Council acts and which is also bound by\r\nthe Council’s decisions; I am referring, of course, to Article\r\n24 and Article 25 of the Charter. That aim has been and\r\nwill continue to be the guideline for our participation in the\r\ndebate on this topic and in the deliberations in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group. The yardstick by which we\r\nassess any proposals made is whether we feel they\r\ncontribute to the achievement of that aim.\r\nWe do not intend in this plenary debate to engage in\r\nan examination of proposals. We do not believe that any\r\ndelegation or group of delegations has, or would even\r\nclaim to have, the ideal solution to this question.\r\nAccordingly, we feel we should leave substantial\r\ndiscussions to the Working Group, where detail may be\r\nmore appropriately addressed.\r\nMy delegation, of course, fully supports the decision\r\nadopted by consensus at the forty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly which noted the report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group and approved the\r\nrecommendation that the Group should continue its work\r\nduring this session of the General Assembly. We intend\r\nto continue to contribute to that work to the best of our\r\nability and in a fully cooperative manner. We hope that\r\nthe Working Group will resume its activities shortly. We\r\nfavour establishment of a schedule of meetings at regular\r\nintervals, with the flexibility to adapt their frequency to\r\ndevelopments in the negotiations. If progress is being\r\nmade, it may be useful to make use occasionally of\r\nsmaller groupings to come up with suggestions on limited\r\nissues, while at the same time maintaining transparency\r\nand preserving scrupulously the authority of the Working\r\nGroup.\r\nIn speaking thus of procedural matters, we are\r\nassuming that the work will now move beyond the\r\ndeliberative stage to a serious negotiating stage. If it does\r\nnot so move, any procedural decisions will be worthless.\r\nNegotiation necessarily means addressing proposals in\r\nincreasing detail. In this respect, it is helpful that some\r\nrelatively detailed ideas have been placed before us by\r\nItaly and Australia. The non-paper prepared by the\r\nWorking Group Chairman during the last session is also\r\nof assistance in moving towards more focused exchanges.\r\nWe hope that the resumption of the work will feature,\r\ninter alia, responses to these documents and\r\ncounter-proposals and that thus we will get down to\r\nserious negotiations.\r\nHowever, none of this will happen unless and until\r\nGovernments go beyond explanation of their own\r\npreoccupations to consideration of the preoccupations of\r\nothers and begin the search for accommodation between\r\nthem. We believe that this subject is too important for\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nthe general well-being of the United Nations to defer that\r\ndevelopment any further.\r\nFinally, I would like to express our appreciation of the\r\nskill and industry of the members of the Bureau of the\r\nWorking Group: Ambassador Insanally, Chairman, and\r\nAmbassadors Breitenstein and Chew, Vice-Chairmen.\r\nTheir efforts have been the major contributing factor in the\r\nprogress achieved so far, which we should not\r\nunderestimate merely because of how far we still have to\r\ngo. We are also confident that the Working Group will be\r\nsteered successfully into and through the next stage of our\r\nnegotiations.\r\nMr. Sitaula (Nepal): I have the great honour and\r\nprivilege to speak on the agenda item before us, which is\r\nof paramount importance to all delegations and to the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole. My delegation expresses its\r\nsincere appreciation to Ambassador Samuel R. Insanally of\r\nGuyana, President of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session, for his personal initiative on the matter\r\nduring his able stewardship as Chairman of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, the Security Council has\r\nbecome the important organ of decision-making and action\r\non various international issues. The fundamental changes\r\nin international relations, together with the rearrangement\r\nof power relations in the post-cold-war world, have made\r\nit necessary to consider the role and composition of the\r\nCouncil. The new imbalance between the North and the\r\nSouth on various political and socio-economic issues is\r\nanother of the reasons behind the argument for\r\nre-examining the composition and functioning of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nMy delegation has actively participated in the\r\ndiscussion on this matter in the Working Group and has\r\nexpressed its position on several occasions. We view this\r\nexercise as an endeavour to strengthen the effectiveness of\r\nthe Security Council on the basis of equitable representation\r\nso that its decisions may have broad-based support and\r\nlegitimacy. The Security Council’s decisions are binding\r\non all Member States since the Council has a special\r\nresponsibility by which it acts on behalf of the entire\r\nmembership of the United Nations. It is of fundamental\r\nimportance, therefore, to explore every possibility to ensure\r\nthat decisions of the Council represent the views of the\r\ngeneral membership.\r\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Nepal\r\nendorses the views expressed at the Eleventh Ministerial\r\nConference of the non-aligned countries held in Cairo in\r\nJune this year and the Movement’s Meeting of Ministers\r\nof Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation, held on 5\r\nOctober 1994, on this matter. These meetings drew\r\nattention in particular to the fact that the non-aligned and\r\ndeveloping countries are underrepresented and that the\r\ncomposition of the Council does not reflect the universal\r\ncharacter of the United Nations. This imbalance\r\nespecially puts into question the legitimacy, equity and\r\ncredibility of the Organization. At the same time, my\r\ndelegation fully shares the view that due consideration\r\nshould be given to the principle of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation in the restructuring and revitalization of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nAn overwhelming majority of the Members of this\r\nOrganization are small States. A situation in which\r\nreasonable opportunity is not afforded to smaller States to\r\ncontribute to the work of the Security Council, in keeping\r\nwith the criteria laid down in Article 23 of the Charter,\r\nwould be contrary to the principle of equitable\r\nrepresentation. In this context, we feel that the current\r\nexercise should not be limited to the enlargement of the\r\nmembership, but that it should also consider a more\r\ncomprehensive package of reforms in the working\r\nmethods and procedures of the Council.\r\nWe attach high value to greater transparency and\r\nopenness in the Council’s work so that a large number of\r\nMembers of the United Nations can contribute to the\r\ndecision-making process. We believe that the increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council should reflect the\r\nreality of the present-day world and international politics.\r\nWe are happy to note that, during the deliberations in the\r\nWorking Group, there was a broad convergence of views\r\non greater transparency and on strengthening the\r\nrelationship between the Council and the general\r\nmembership.\r\nNepal, as a significant troop-contributor to United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations, feels that there is a\r\nneed for a consultative mechanism of the Security\r\nCouncil with troop- contributing countries, especially\r\nwhen decisions are taken regarding the mandates of new\r\npeace-keeping operations and the revision or renewal of\r\nmission mandates.\r\nFinally, on the relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, the issuance by the\r\nSecurity Council of a substantive annual report and\r\nspecial reports for the consideration of the General\r\nAssembly, as and when necessary, would provide an\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\ninvaluable opportunity for the general membership to\r\nconsider the work of the Council. This practice would also\r\nhelp strengthen the relationship between the Council and\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Lamptey (Ghana): This being my first time at\r\nthe rostrum, let me first congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly and on\r\nthe able manner in which you have conducted its affairs so\r\nfar. It is the hope of my delegation that your guidance will\r\nspeed the process of reform of the United Nations and\r\nparticularly of the Security Council.\r\nRecent developments and trends in global politics have\r\ngiven the United Nations a central role in the unfolding\r\ninternational order. More important, the outbreak of\r\nconflicts in virtually all regions of the world, with the need\r\nfor peace to be established and kept, has placed the\r\nSecurity Council in a critical position in world affairs. It\r\nis evident that the international political situation on which\r\nthe Security Council was built is entirely different today.\r\nIf the Security Council is to perform efficiently and\r\neffectively the role assigned it under the Charter, the\r\ninternational community must seize the opportunity offered\r\nby the propitious post-cold-war atmosphere and the ongoing\r\nreforms within the United Nations to bring the Security\r\nCouncil into sharper focus, fine-tuning it as a preeminent\r\nfocal point of United Nations action in the arena of global\r\npeace. The composition and distribution of seats and the\r\nresultant powers enjoyed by members of the Security\r\nCouncil today are predicated upon certain factors which at\r\nthe relevant point in history were defensible and justifiable.\r\nAlthough these arrangements were well-founded and have\r\nserved us relatively well, it is the view of my delegation\r\nthat the time has come when we should boldly rethink and\r\nrearrange things in such a way as to bring the Security\r\nCouncil into line with current changed circumstances.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nIn 1945, the membership of the United Nations was\r\n51. Then in 1963, the membership having expanded to\r\n162, the need was felt for an increase in the number of\r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council from 6 to\r\n10 to reflect an equitable geographical representation. Now\r\nmore than ever, with an expansion in membership to 184,\r\nit has become imperative that existing arrangements be\r\nreviewed.\r\nFurthermore, the Ghana delegation believes that\r\npermanent membership in the Security Council of the five\r\nmajor wartime allies, although well-founded then, has\r\nbecome obsolete. And if it is thought necessary to retain\r\npermanent membership of the Council, then new\r\narrangements must be reached which will create a general\r\nsense of equality and global balance in an organ as vital\r\nas the Security Council.\r\nThe question that immediately comes to mind is\r\nwhether or not the veto power in the possession of the\r\nfive permanent members is still necessary in the present\r\nera. This is certainly a matter that needs to be discussed\r\nthoroughly if the reform is to promote equity. Ghana\r\nsubscribes fully to the position collectively articulated by\r\nthe African Group on this question. At the same time, we\r\nare aware of the varied positions assumed by other groups\r\nand countries. We shall join in the creative effort to find\r\nmeaningful compromises to ensure a better system.\r\nWhat is important to emphasize here is that, despite\r\nour call for the increase in the number of Security\r\nCouncil members to 25, the issue is not a quantitative one\r\n- it is a qualitative one. It has to do with the exercise of\r\npower. It is the perception of most, including Ghana, that\r\nthe power inherent in the right of veto should no longer\r\nbe exercised by a privileged few and that its exercise\r\nshould be democratized in such a way as to reflect\r\nbalance, equity and the reality of the present international\r\norder as symbolized in the membership of this\r\nOrganization. There could be many ways to achieve this\r\nobjective and we should all be creative in this regard.\r\nWe need a new Security Council that will reflect the\r\nwill of every nation on earth. We need a Security\r\nCouncil whose work is transparently reflective of all our\r\ncommon aspirations. We need a Security Council shorn\r\nof every vestige of big-Power politics, self-righteousness\r\nand the arrogance of size or wealth. Above all, we need\r\na Security Council that will not usurp the function of\r\nbona fide international legal institutions and their regimes\r\nof the rule of law, a Council that cannot assume the role\r\nof a global supreme court without the benefit of a\r\nbalanced mechanism through which accused nations can\r\ndefend themselves, a Council without the attributes of\r\nprosecutors, judges and executioners of judgments at\r\ntimes flawed by bias, prejudice and preconceptions. It is\r\ntime to construct a new Security Council if we are to\r\nmove away from the failures of the past and remove the\r\nblatant weaknesses of the present.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nIn this regard, my delegation hopes that the broad\r\nconsensus that has been achieved so far by the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council will guide the Group to fashion a formula\r\nthat will make the Council credible. We hope this can be\r\nachieved well before the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIf our perception of the new relevance of the United\r\nNations in a rapidly changing global situation remains\r\nanchored in the cardinal principles of justice, equity and\r\nfairness, the new Security Council that will emerge from\r\nthese momentous reform efforts will become the true\r\nsentinel at the door of total human freedom, development\r\nand peace, guarding us all against the tyranny of arms and\r\nwealth and the subversive agency of unacceptable rogue\r\nconduct on the part of any nation, big or small, rich or\r\npoor.\r\nMr. Fedotov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): I wish to join other speakers in conveying high\r\npraise to the Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session, and to the Vice-\r\nChairmen, Ambassador Breitenstein of Finland and\r\nAmbassador Chew of Singapore.\r\nThe Russian Federation believes that our consideration\r\nof this item should be seen in the general context of\r\nadapting the United Nations to the political, economic,\r\nsocial and other realities of today’s world. As the President\r\nof the Russian Federation, Mr. Boris N. Yeltsin, stressed in\r\nhis address to the Assembly at this session,\r\n\"it will be impossible to avoid changes in the Security\r\nCouncil, which should remain sufficiently compact\r\nand an effective functioning body. This is especially\r\nimportant because, according to the Charter, the\r\nSecurity Council bears primary responsibility for\r\nsupporting and maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity.\" (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nForty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th meeting,\r\npp. 4-5)\r\nFor the first time in many decades, the Security\r\nCouncil has in recent years been active and energetic in\r\ncarrying out that difficult mission. To its credit are a\r\nnumber of successful peace-keeping operations and very\r\nimportant decisions aimed at the prevention and settlement\r\nof conflicts and at strengthening security and stability in\r\nvarious parts of the world. A most cooperative\r\nrelationship has developed among the members of the\r\nSecurity Council, which would have been unthinkable\r\nduring the cold war, when the Security Council was\r\nfrequently used not to search seriously search for\r\nsolutions to pressing problems but to air ideological\r\nattitudes.\r\nThat is why it is important to us that consideration\r\nof the question of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council be carried out\r\nin a pragmatic, constructive manner and not turned into\r\na cause of political friction. The large number of\r\nconflicts in the world and the active involvement of the\r\nUnited Nations in settling them means that our approach\r\nto this matter must be thoughtful and cautious. We\r\ncannot permit the paralysis of a machinery that has been\r\nworking in a well-adjusted and on the whole successful\r\nway.\r\nIn the opinion of the Russian Federation, an\r\nabsolute, mandatory condition for resolving the question\r\nof increasing the Council’s membership is that the\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council be maintained and\r\nstrengthened, especially in the present situation, when the\r\nworld has barely recovered from the threat of global\r\nnuclear confrontation and is facing new challenges to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nFor that reason, Russia supports the proposal for a\r\nlimited expansion of the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, up to a limit of 20 seats. This would make it\r\npossible to maintain the Council’s ability to react\r\neffectively and promptly to sudden changes in\r\ninternational affairs.\r\nIn doing this, it is very important to observe the\r\ncriteria laid down in the Charter for membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, to the effect that due regard should be\r\nspecially paid, in the first instance to the contribution of\r\nMembers of the United Nations to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and to the other purposes\r\nof the Organization, and also to equitable geographical\r\ndistribution. In our view, the present status of the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council should be\r\nmaintained.\r\nWe realize the need for the Security Council, in\r\ntaking decisions, to rely broadly on the views of all\r\nMembers of the United Nations, and consider that, to that\r\nend, all the potential inherent in the Charter should be put\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nto better use. Last year, the Security Council itself took a\r\nnumber of practical steps along these lines. Decisions were\r\ntaken within existing procedures enabling other Members of\r\nthe United Nations to receive fuller, prompter information\r\nabout the Council’s activities and to convey their views to\r\nmembers of the Council. We believe that those useful\r\nefforts should be continued.\r\nFurther improvement of the functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil should, in our view, be approached very carefully\r\nand without undue haste. It is essential that consensus\r\nmeasures be devised to preserve the Council’s role as the\r\ncentral United Nations body bearing primary responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe Russian delegation has been actively involved in\r\nthe work of the Open-ended Working Group considering all\r\naspects of the increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. In our view, the report of that Working Group,\r\nwhich was adopted by the General Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session, presents a full and objective picture of the\r\ncurrent state of the Group’s consideration of the item. We\r\nare prepared to continue our active participation in the work\r\nof the Group, and are open to constructive cooperation with\r\nall Members of the United Nations on this important matter.\r\nMr. Butler (Australia): The report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group describes important first steps towards\r\nstrengthening the Security Council. There has been\r\nprogress in areas under the second cluster of issues those\r\ndealing with improvements in the working methods of the\r\nCouncil. But much more is needed.\r\nThe President of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session, Ambassador Insanally, and the two\r\nVice-Chairmen of the Working Group, Ambassadors Chew\r\nTai Soo of Singapore and Willy Breitenstein of Finland, did\r\noutstanding work in guiding the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup. But the report of the Working Group reflects\r\nhesitancy by the membership in reflecting the substance of\r\nthe debate in that Group and the key areas on which\r\nconvergence of views emerged. For this and for other\r\nreasons we are convinced that the discussion now needs to\r\nfocus on concrete proposals if it is to serve the agreed\r\nobjective of bringing about change. It will be through\r\ndiscussion and negotiation of concrete proposals that an\r\nemerging understanding of what is effective, realistic and\r\nequitable will emerge.\r\nIn his statement to the Assembly on 3 October, the\r\nAustralian Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, put\r\nsome illustrative proposals on the table. Those proposals\r\nrest on the following basic premises:\r\nFirst, there is agreement that the Council must be\r\nexpanded. This agreement is recorded in the report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group.\r\nSecondly, an expanded Security Council must be\r\nrepresentative in order to maintain its perceived\r\nlegitimacy and thus its future viability. For example,\r\npresent geographical representation on the Council is\r\nunbalanced. The membership must be expanded to\r\nensure that the Council better represents the universal\r\nmembership than it does today.\r\nThirdly, it will be important that all apply rigorously\r\nthe criteria and qualifications for Security Council\r\nmembership elaborated in Article 23 of the Charter. In\r\nour view, seeking to elaborate criteria additional to those\r\ncontained in Article 23 is likely to be an unproductive\r\ndistraction from the main business of the Working Group\r\nand we would discourage travel down that path.\r\nFourthly, an expanded Council must be effective and\r\ncapable of responding quickly to the range of difficult\r\nsituations with which the international community is\r\nbeing and can expect to be confronted - particularly\r\ndeadly conflicts and massive human rights violations\r\noccurring within States. Thus, the new Council must be\r\nrepresentative of the broad range of interests, perspectives\r\nand capabilities of Member States.\r\nFifthly, that expansion must be kept within strict\r\nnumerical limits because, as is very widely recognized,\r\nthere is a size beyond which the Council will not be able\r\nto function effectively. There appeared to be an emerging\r\nconsensus in the Working Group that the number of\r\nmembers should not exceed 25.\r\nSixthly, Australia would regard conferring the veto\r\npower on any new permanent member of the Council as\r\ninconsistent with its diminishing use in a more\r\ncooperative atmosphere of collective security\r\ndecision-making. For these same reasons, we believe it\r\nwould be appropriate to slightly dilute the veto power of\r\nthe existing five permanent members by requiring two\r\nfrom their number to concur in its exercise.\r\nSenator Evans offered specific illustrative models in\r\norder to help focus the discussion of the General\r\nAssembly and the future work of the Working Group on\r\nthe questions of composition and size and their\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nrelationship to equitable geographical representation. Our\r\naction expressed our belief that it is possible to move\r\nbeyond the abstract into discussion and negotiations on\r\nconcrete proposals and we encourage others to do the\r\nsame.\r\nThe models we submitted for consideration are set out\r\nin an attachment to our written statement that has been\r\ncirculated to Members of the Assembly.\r\nThe model that would most simply meet the legitimate\r\naspirations of the largest States excluded at present from\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council - including\r\nJapan and Germany, whose claims we support - would\r\ninvolve the creation of five new permanent membership\r\nseats. Assuming the continuation of the existing regional\r\ngroups, three new permanent members would come from\r\nAfrica and Asia, one from the Group of Western European\r\nand Other States, and one from Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean.\r\nIf, as seems possible, agreement on a simple model of\r\nthis kind proves to be not easily reachable, it may be worth\r\ngiving consideration to a more complex alternative model.\r\nWe have in mind one which would no doubt, in practice,\r\nguarantee effective permanency for the largest States\r\nexcluded at present from the council, including Japan and\r\nGermany. But it would at the same time give a greater\r\ndegree of flexibility to the Council’s structure, and greater\r\nopportunities for recognition of several other countries that\r\nhave made a major contribution to the Organization. We\r\nwould envisage the removal of the prohibition on\r\nsuccessive terms for non-permanent members. It might, for\r\nthose reasons, be a model capable of commanding\r\nwidespread support. This alternative model would involve,\r\nin addition to the five existing permanent members, whose\r\nveto power would again be slightly diluted, as already\r\noutlined, the creation of eight quasi-permanent seats,\r\nallocated among regional groups, for which consecutive\r\nelection would be possible, together with 10 rotating\r\nnon-permanent seats. It would make abundant sense, in our\r\nview, for the existing regional groups to be at the same\r\ntime modified to reflect post-cold-war realities. A\r\nsuggested way in which these 23 seats might be distributed\r\namong such a new set of regional groups is also set out in\r\nthe table attached to the circulated text of this statement.\r\nThat table also sets out how they might be distributed\r\namong the existing groups. On this model, the question of\r\nwhich States became quasi-permanent members, and how\r\nlong they remained on the Council in that capacity, would\r\nbe a matter for determination by the regional group in\r\nquestion.\r\nThese models give due consideration to the benefits\r\nof retaining an appropriate balance in the proportion of\r\npermanent to quasi-permanent or non-permanent\r\nmembers. While the Council’s effectiveness is well\r\nserved by having a core of members with lengthy\r\nexperience, these models also rest on the healthy rotation\r\nof membership of countries, large and small, which would\r\nbring the full range of perspectives on international affairs\r\nto the work of the Council.Any changes such as those\r\ndescribed in these models would require amendments to\r\nArticles 23, 27 and 108 of the Charter. The opportunity\r\nshould be taken at the same time to remove the\r\nanachronistic \"enemy States\" clauses in Articles 53 and\r\n107. An accompanying General Assembly resolution\r\ncould elaborate any new regional-group arrangements and\r\nany other understandings reached on a new Council.\r\nWe do not suggest that the models we have\r\nadvanced are the only possible approaches. They are\r\nprinted on paper, not etched in stone. These or any such\r\nmodels lend themselves to various possible permutations\r\nand combinations. It is only by thinking about such\r\nconcrete possibilities that we will be able to distinguish\r\nbetween the plausible and the fanciful. We have heard\r\nfrom many speakers the expressed determination to move\r\nin a spirit of good will and conscientiousness to see that\r\nthe United Nations for the next 50 years is soundly built.\r\nAn expanded, newly legitimized Security Council is a\r\ncrucial foundation to that building.\r\nTurning now briefly to how the work of the\r\nWorking Group can best progress, we believe the\r\nWorking Group should accelerate its deliberations with\r\nthe aim of agreeing on the basis for expansion by the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Our\r\ndeliberations will benefit from the convening of informal\r\nconsultations to be held parallel with the Working Group\r\nin order to develop formulas for the expansion of the\r\nCouncil and to assist in developing a convergence of\r\napproach on such formulas. These processes should\r\ncommence as soon as possible.\r\nThe United Nations time has come. It can become\r\nthe Organization envisaged in its Charter. Agreement on\r\na new Security Council would be a very important signal\r\nthat the United Nations is fulfilling its promise. It is a\r\nsignal that would be recognized by Member States and by\r\npeople around the world.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nMr. Pak Gil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): Mankind wishes to live in peace in the world, free\r\nfrom any domination or subjugation. However, domination\r\nand subjugation on the globe still remain unchecked, and\r\nthat is largely related to the existing inequitable\r\ninternational order and relationships.\r\nI note with satisfaction that efforts are being made to\r\nrestructure the Security Council as part of measures aimed\r\nat correcting such inequality in international relationships.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the progress made by the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council formed pursuant to General Assembly\r\nresolution 48/26 of 3 December 1993.\r\nThe restructuring of the Security Council is an\r\nimportant undertaking in light of the demands of the\r\ndeveloping countries, which make up a majority of the\r\nUnited Nations membership, and the principle of justness\r\nand democracy.\r\nIn this regard my delegation believes that the\r\nproposals of the developing countries and the position\r\nmentioned in the Final Document of the Foreign Ministers’\r\nmeeting of the Non-Aligned Movement held in Cairo last\r\nJune, are of great significance and due consideration should\r\nbe given to them.\r\nLet me make a few points with regard to the reform\r\nof the Security Council. Almost half a century has elapsed\r\nsince the creation of the United Nations. During this period\r\nthe United Nations membership has increased to 184 and\r\nnoticeable changes in international relations have taken\r\nplace. However, the developing countries are still not\r\nequally represented in the Security Council and are\r\nexcluded from decision-making. Therefore democracy is\r\nnot fully guaranteed in the Security Council. Even worse,\r\nbig countries often have a monopoly on its use. We\r\ntherefore support proposals to enlarge the membership of\r\nthe Security Council that are aimed at allocating more seats\r\nto the developing countries.\r\nSome countries are of the opinion that criteria for\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council must be\r\nbased on considerations such as the level of development of\r\ncountries and their capability of financially contributing to\r\nthe United Nations. These views, I believe, are designed to\r\nenlarge the membership of the Security Council by only big\r\nand developed countries and to prevent developing\r\ncountries from joining it. Restructuring the Security\r\nCouncil in this way will only contribute to an expansion\r\nof the existing imbalance.\r\nThus, a proportionate number of permanent-member\r\nseats in the Security Council should be given to\r\ndeveloping countries so that their views and interests can\r\nbe represented in the Security Council. In particular, due\r\nconsideration should be given to the allocation of seats to\r\ncountries in Asia, Africa and Latin America on the\r\nprinciple of equitable regional representation.\r\nIn addition, the number of non-permanent seats in\r\nthe Security Council needs to be increased to give\r\nopportunities to other developing countries to participate\r\nin the work of the Security Council. That would\r\nstrengthen the Security Council by making it responsive\r\nand relevant to prevailing realities, and credible and\r\neffective.\r\nThe General Assembly must play an important role\r\nin maintaining international peace and security. In this\r\nregard, steps should be taken to make the Security\r\nCouncil accountable to the General Assembly for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that the relationship\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly\r\nshould be readjusted in such a manner that the decisions\r\nof the Security Council regarding military intervention\r\nand economic sanctions should be endorsed by a two-\r\nthirds majority or by consensus in the General Assembly.\r\nAs for the Japanese position regarding permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council and deletion of\r\n\"enemy State\" clauses in the United Nations Charter, my\r\ndelegation wishes to draw the attention of the General\r\nAssembly to the following point.\r\nAs is well known, Japan is a defeated State of the\r\nSecond World War and it brought much suffering and\r\ncaused much damage to Asian people and the world’s\r\npeople as a whole. Japan is now pursuing a plan to\r\nbecome a military and nuclear Power while trying to\r\ncheat the world by paying only lip-service to apology and\r\ncompensation for its past aggression and war crimes.\r\nThe people of Asia and of the world express serious\r\nconcern over Japanese behaviour, and they are not in a\r\nposition to support Japan in its attempt to get a permanent\r\nseat on the Security Council unless Japan is willing to\r\nmake a clean slate of the crimes it committed during the\r\nSecond World War.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nFor these reasons, in my view, it is premature to talk\r\nabout the possibility of permanent membership for Japan on\r\nthe Security Council and the deletion of the \"enemy State\"\r\nclauses in the United Nations Charter.\r\nIn conclusion, I hope that the joint efforts and\r\nendeavours of many delegations will bring about realistic\r\nresults in the discussion of this item at this meeting.\r\nMr. Sychou (Belarus) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe delegation of Belarus regards our current discussion on\r\nthe question of equitable representation in the Security\r\nCouncil and the increase in its membership as a substantive\r\nstage on the way to resolving specific aspects of the\r\nproblem. We believe that arriving at a consensus on the\r\nbasis of an achieved understanding on the need to expand\r\nthe membership of the Security Council should be focused\r\nto a greater degree on elaborating practical agreements for\r\ncarrying out reform of the membership and configuration as\r\nwell as the functioning of the Council. The organizational\r\nframework of this work could be provided by the unofficial\r\nconsultations and official meetings of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group under the guidance of the President of the\r\nlast session of the Assembly and his two deputies, the\r\ndistinguished representatives of Finland and Singapore.\r\nFiguratively speaking, we should say that at this stage\r\nof the discussion we have to synchronize our watches in\r\norder to coordinate our efforts to find ways and means of\r\nimproving the Security Council’s activities under changed\r\ncircumstances. We believe that success in the negotiations\r\non reforming the Security Council and setting the timetable\r\nand the ways and means of carrying this out will largely\r\ndepend on three factors: the political willingness of States\r\nMembers of the Organization, abundant clarity in their\r\npositions and a willingness to strike a balance of interests\r\non the part of all interested parties.\r\nIn this context I would like to recall the essence of\r\nwhat the position of Belarus has been, as revealed in the\r\ngeneral political discussion. First, if the United Nations is\r\nto continue to work effectively, there must be far-reaching\r\nreform of its main bodies, including the Security Council.\r\nSecondly, the representation of countries and regions in the\r\nSecurity Council should take more fully into account the\r\ninterests of all groups of countries, including the Eastern\r\nEuropean Group. Thirdly, any reform of the Security\r\nCouncil should not detract from its role as the body that\r\nbears the main responsibility for maintaining international\r\npeace and security, which is something that we all need,\r\nparticularly small States Members of the United Nations.\r\nFourthly, the Government of the Republic of Belarus\r\nregards favourably the proposal to increase the number of\r\npermanent members of the Security Council by including\r\nStates which are making an exceptional contribution to\r\nachieving the purposes of the Charter.\r\nIn this context, our delegation believes that countries\r\nthat have declared their intention to assume additional\r\nresponsibility in the future for maintaining international\r\npeace and serving other purposes enunciated in the United\r\nNations Charter and which are requesting permanent\r\nmembership or so-called extended representation in the\r\nSecurity Council, could even now assume a greater share\r\nof the financial burden of expenses for peace-keeping\r\noperations. This would help to achieve a more rapid\r\nconsensus on the criteria for selecting new permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. However, any increase\r\nin the number of permanent seats should not reduce the\r\npossibility of the election and participation in the work of\r\nthe Security Council of other States, from all regional\r\ngroups, as non-permanent members. I would particularly\r\nlike to single out certain other important aspects of the\r\nfuture work on the renewal and reform of the Security\r\nCouncil that may possibly be of interest to States that are\r\nnot actually seeking permanent membership in the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nFirst, as long as, in the General Assembly, there are\r\nfive regional groups, Belarus cannot accept the concept of\r\nreforming the Security Council on the basis of a bipolar\r\nview of the world along North-South lines or among the\r\nfour regional continental groups. We favour looking for\r\nreforms of the Security Council that would be based\r\nessentially on the concept of a multipolar world, would\r\ntake into account the increased membership of our\r\nOrganization, and would provide an opportunity for the\r\nequitable and genuine participation of small countries in\r\nthe activities of the Security Council as non-permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nSecondly, we believe that the total representation of\r\ncountries from all regions in the Security Council could\r\nand should be more democratic in nature. Achieving this\r\nis possible only if we are completely clear about the\r\nfuture membership of the five regional groups in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. It is absolutely necessary that we take\r\ninto account the most recent changes in various parts of\r\nthe world, the possible intention on the part of certain\r\ncountries to seek membership in other regional groups\r\nand a more equitable distribution of regional quotas for\r\nthe election of non-permanent members if we are to\r\nensure the representation of countries from each region\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nand a more equitable rotation among countries within\r\nregional groups.\r\nThirdly, any formula for altering the membership and\r\nconfiguration of the Security Council must not fail to take\r\ninto account the legitimate national and general interests of\r\nStates Members of each of the five regional groups.\r\nNaturally, this is equally true of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States, whose number, as you know, has\r\nconsiderably increased over recent years as a result of the\r\nformation of new independent States. In this connection, it\r\nis rather anomalous to consider a number of proposals that\r\ndo not always reveal the prospect of an additional rotational\r\nseat for the Eastern European Group of States, which, as I\r\nsaid, has in fact accounted for a considerable increase in the\r\ntotal membership of our Organization. Therefore, success\r\nin the next stage of negotiating on the upper and lower\r\nlevels of the additional seats for the members of the\r\nSecurity Council has to be connected to necessarily having\r\nat least one extra place for each of the regional groups\r\namong the non-permanent members and also intraregional\r\nagreements on how they shall be filled.\r\nFourthly, achieving consensus on many of the specific\r\nproblems related to the reform of the Security Council is\r\nbeing held up by difficulties in resolving the procedures and\r\nthe current practices of having a prior selection of\r\ncandidates within certain existing regional groups of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Therefore, our delegation supports the\r\nidea of interregional agreements on the basis of rotation,\r\nputting forward candidacies for the rotational seats in the\r\nSecurity Council regardless of the existing or future\r\nconstitution of its permanent membership and of their\r\ndistribution among regions or continents.\r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Belarus is prepared\r\nto cooperate with any interested States to develop further\r\nthese ideas, on the basis of the following premise: any\r\nincrease in the permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil should not lead to a reduction in the ratio of the\r\npermanent and rotational seats in a more representative\r\nSecurity Council. The current and possibly future\r\noverrepresentation of the group of Western European and\r\nother States and the underrepresentation of three regional\r\ngroups whose legitimate interests are collectively expressed\r\nand defended by the Non-Aligned Movement cannot serve\r\nas the grounds for doing a disservice to the interest of those\r\ncountries that make up the Eastern European Group. The\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution and other\r\nprinciples for selecting non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council as set forth in Article 23, paragraphs 1\r\nand 2, of the Charter of the United Nations, should be\r\nfaithfully and fully applied in achieving both equitable\r\nintraregional agreements for filling the two-year and\r\nadditional rotational seats and interregional agreements on\r\nnew balanced quotas among the non-permanent seats for\r\neach of the five regional groups.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of the Republic of\r\nBelarus is convinced that reforming the Security Council\r\nmust necessarily involve the democratization of its\r\nprocedures. Any reforms of this body that are carried out\r\nshould in no way reduce the level of effectiveness already\r\nreached in its work as the United Nations body that bears\r\nprimary responsibility for maintaining international peace\r\nand security on behalf of and in the interest of, all States\r\nMembers of our Organization.\r\nMr. Muthaura (Kenya): The agenda item before\r\nus, \"Question of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters,\" is an issue of great interest to the general\r\nmembership of the Organization. Strong arguments were\r\nadvanced at the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly and deeper elaborations of those arguments\r\nhave been amply discussed in the Assembly’s Open-\r\nEnded Working Group, whose summary report has been\r\nsubmitted to us. It is not a question of whether there is\r\njustification for reforming the Council but of how best to\r\ndo so in order to enhance its legitimacy, effectiveness and\r\naccountability.\r\nIn this regard I wish to associate my delegation with\r\nthe views that were ably expressed by Tunisia on behalf\r\nof the Organization of African Unity and by Indonesia on\r\nbehalf of the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned\r\nCountries. We, however, wish to highlight a few points.\r\nAs envisaged in the Charter the Security Council\r\nbears the primary responsibility for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security on behalf of the United\r\nNations. Such a responsibility bestows upon the\r\nCouncil’s members, both individually and collectively, the\r\nheavy duty of the effective management of international\r\nconflicts and situations that threaten international peace\r\nand security, to be carried out on behalf of the entire\r\nmembership of the Organization. Needless to say, this\r\nobligation should be impartially applicable, whether the\r\nthreat is targeted against small States or big States.\r\nSmaller countries feel even more threatened by insecurity\r\nthan do bigger ones, which have the ability to deter\r\nthreats directed against them. It is also important for the\r\nAssembly to appreciate that threats to international peace\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nand security have important geographical dimensions that\r\ncannot be ignored as we deliberate Security Council reform.\r\nIronically, in its present form and working methods\r\nthe Security Council tends to deal with conflicts occurring\r\nin certain countries and that have serious implications for\r\nneighbouring countries without the countries most\r\nconcerned being given the opportunity to participate in the\r\ndiscussions within the Security Council that are aimed at\r\nsolving or containing such conflicts. In this connection it\r\nis our view that interested countries, and particularly the\r\ncountries that are neighbours of the country or region at the\r\ncentre of conflict, should be given ample opportunity, in the\r\nCouncil’s informal and formal discussions, to assist the\r\nCouncil to take appropriate measures. Almost invariably,\r\nneighbouring countries bear the heaviest burden of the\r\nrepercussions of conflicts, either in terms of refugees and\r\nthe overflow of insecurity or in terms of the enforcement\r\nmeasures taken by the Council, such as sanctions.\r\nThis brings me to the issue of equitable regional\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council. I have already\r\nstressed the importance of the geographical dimension with\r\nregard to threats to international peace and security.\r\nAccordingly, it is in the interests of the Council that all\r\nregions be equitably represented by both the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent membership of the Council. An effective\r\nregional representation will ensure that the Council is\r\nadequately sensitized with regard to the regional perceptions\r\nand complexities of the conflict in question. A better-\r\ninformed Council would naturally make more objective and\r\npopular decisions on behalf of the general membership of\r\nthe Organization. Not only should the Council’s decision-\r\nmaking be objective, it should be seen to be objective, and\r\nin the interest of the general membership. That\r\nconsideration is more evident at the present time, when the\r\nCouncil is being over-stretched by the growing number of\r\nconflicts in which the United Nations is involved\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nWith regard to the size of the Council, we appreciate\r\nthe rationale behind the present number of permanent seats.\r\nNone the less, the notion of perpetual permanent seats on\r\nthe Security Council does not appear to be consistent with\r\nthe evolution of world power relationships. This is one of\r\nthe reasons why a proposal has been made to expand the\r\nnumber of permanent seats to include a few other world\r\nPowers that have emerged since the Organization was\r\nfounded. It would be of great significance if the notion of\r\npermanency were qualified in the reformed Security\r\nCouncil to make possible a review of the membership of\r\npermanent seats after a decade or two.\r\nThe non-represented regions of Africa and Latin\r\nAmerica and the under-represented region of Asia should\r\nbe accorded their due share of permanent seats.\r\nThe criteria for the selection of permanent members\r\nof the Security Council set forth in Article 23 of the\r\nCharter need to be interpreted more liberally to include\r\nthe principle of regional representation. In this regard,\r\nseats allocated for regional representation should be filled\r\nby election by the General Assembly on the basis of\r\nregional nominations. This process would ensure the\r\nmaintenance of the important principle that Security\r\nCouncil members act on behalf of the general\r\nmembership.\r\nThe non-permanent seats on the Security Council,\r\nwhich currently stand at 10, are too few for the remaining\r\n179 Member States of the United Nations. It is\r\nimperative, therefore, that the number be correspondingly\r\nincreased, taking into account the Charter requirement for\r\nequitable geographical distribution.\r\nMany delegations have expressed the view that a\r\nSecurity Council of 25 members would, at present, be a\r\nrealistic option. We subscribe to that view, taking into\r\naccount the arguments that have been presented on the\r\nneed to ensure legitimacy, equitable regional\r\nrepresentation and proportionate representation of the\r\ngeneral membership. Among those 25 seats it is possible\r\nto negotiate the distribution of both permanent and non-\r\npermanent seats to correct the imbalance created by\r\nhistory, particularly with regard to the distribution of the\r\npermanent seats on the Security Council.\r\nDuring the discussions of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup there was general agreement that transparency in\r\nthe working methods of the Security Council and the\r\ninvolvement of countries contributing troops to peace-\r\nkeeping activities, as well as other, closely associated\r\ncountries, in the Council’s informal consultations would\r\nenhance that body’s effectiveness. We appreciate the\r\nmeasures recently taken by the Security Council towards\r\nthat end and hope that much more will be done to redress\r\nthe various weaknesses that have been highlighted during\r\nthe deliberations of the Working Group and the debate in\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nWe need not elaborate on the need to democratize\r\nthe decision-making process in the Council, including the\r\nneed to do away with the power of the veto, the most\r\nundemocratic decision-making method inscribed -\r\nunfortunately - in the Charter.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nWe endorse the proposal by the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the renewal of its mandate to enable it to\r\ncomplete its task. It is our hope that the Working Group\r\nwill utilize the unique opportunity available on the eve of\r\nthe Organization’s fiftieth anniversary to facilitate\r\nconsensus on this vital issue of Security Council reform.\r\nFinally, I wish to take this opportunity to express my\r\ndelegation’s appreciation to Ambassador Samuel Insanally\r\nof Guyana, President of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\neighth session, who so ably steered the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group. We also wish to commend his two Vice-\r\nChairmen, Ambassador Wilhelm Breitenstein of Finland\r\nand Ambassador Chew Tai Soo of Singapore for their\r\nintellectual and diplomatic skills and for dedicating many\r\nlong hours to ensuring that the Working Group made\r\nprogress.\r\nMr. Sengwe (Zimbabwe): A few days ago the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe, Mr. Nathan\r\nShamuyarira, conveyed to Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire\r\nthe felicitations of our delegation on his well-deserved\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at this,\r\nits forty-ninth session. I echo those sentiments and pledge\r\nmy delegation’s full support and cooperation towards the\r\nsuccessful discharge of his mandate.\r\nI should like also to congratulate Ambassador\r\nInsanally of Guyana on his sterling conduct of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session and, in particular, on\r\nhis chairmanship of the Open-ended Working Group of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the issue before us. Our\r\ncommendation is due also to the two Vice-Chairmen,\r\nAmbassadors Chew Tai Soo of Singapore and Wilhelm\r\nBreitenstein of Finland. We thus welcome the report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation On and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU) has issued\r\nan African common position, and the Movement of Non-\r\nAligned Countries has issued declarations and communiqués\r\nstating its position on the issues currently before us.\r\nZimbabwe fully supports and subscribes to these collective\r\npositions on the restructuring and reorganization of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nAs we all know, the Security Council is mandated,\r\nunder the Charter, with the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In an\r\nincreasingly turbulent world the Council is being called\r\nupon to act under increasingly delicate and complex\r\ncircumstances. Hence, if it is to have greater efficiency\r\nand effectiveness it needs to wield greater legitimacy,\r\nmoral authority and credibility. This is possible only in\r\ncircumstances of greater transparency and accountability\r\non the part of the Council. In the absence of democracy\r\nand equitable representativeness, there can be no\r\ntransparency or accountability.\r\nThus any Security Council reform must begin on the\r\npremise that the democratic ethic that is now a cause for\r\ncelebration within our national borders should find\r\nexpression at the international level too. In this respect,\r\nthe notion of absolute permanent membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and the attendant veto should now be\r\nregarded as relics of a bygone era and should therefore be\r\nabolished. Is it not the greatest irony of our times that\r\nthose who assiduously resist the democratization of\r\nrelations between nations are the most vocal in insisting\r\non democratic governance within nations?\r\nFrom the work done so far, it would appear that\r\nattainment of the goal of abolishing absolute permanent\r\nmembership and the veto may be long in coming.\r\nTherefore, any transitional arrangements arrived at must\r\nseriously address the imbalances and injustices of existing\r\narrangements.\r\nIt is quite clear that the geographical distribution of\r\nboth permanent and non-permanent membership of the\r\nSecurity Council is grossly inequitable. This has to be\r\nrectified if the decisions of the Council are to get the\r\nstamp of legitimacy that the nature of its mandate\r\nrequires. However, we believe that, in the interim period,\r\nthe mandates of any additional members of the Security\r\nCouncil should be subject to periodic review.\r\nNevertheless, for their periods on the Council they should\r\nenjoy the same rights and privileges, including the veto,\r\nas the existing permanent members. The ultimate goal\r\nshould continue to be that all members of the Security\r\nCouncil are subject to election. The principle of the\r\nconsent of the governed is paramount.\r\nWe believe that while the institution of the veto\r\nlasts, its use should be circumscribed so as to prevent its\r\nunilateral use to promote or protect narrow national\r\ninterests.\r\nWe take note of the limited reforms introduced by\r\nthe Security Council in recent months. Several\r\nrepresentatives have already alluded to these, and we shall\r\nnot labour the point. However, my delegation believes\r\nthat these cosmetic reforms should not be seen as\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nsubstitutes for the more fundamental change that we seek.\r\nTowards the conclusion of the forty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly some members suggested in the Working\r\nGroup that perhaps we needed to formalize the limited\r\nchanges in working methods that the Security Council has\r\nbeen pressured into introducing. We fear that formalization\r\nof otherwise superficial changes could only foster a false\r\nsense of accomplishment. Our approach should be that of\r\na comprehensive package - a package that will ensure the\r\ncreation of a transparent, representative and democratic\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Biegman (Netherlands): As the hour is late I\r\nshall be brief.\r\nMy delegation welcomed the establishment of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the question before us, and\r\nI wish to thank its Chairman, Ambassador Insanally and the\r\nVice-Chairmen, Ambassadors Breitenstein and Chew, for\r\ntheir tireless efforts and laudable contributions in this\r\nregard.\r\nThe Group’s report was extremely short because,\r\ndespite a convergence of views on many matters, consensus\r\nwas still far away. Nevertheless, on one point all States\r\nMembers are agreed: that the Security Council should be\r\nenlarged to some extent. This common conviction is in\r\nitself an important step forward.\r\nWe hope that during this session of the General\r\nAssembly the Open-ended Working Group will be able to\r\nnarrow the differences that still exist and enhance the\r\nconvergence so that it can come forward with more\r\nconcrete proposals.\r\nIn his speech to the General Assembly the Netherlands\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs outlined a number of priorities\r\nand principles which, in the view of my Government,\r\nshould be respected in the process of reforming the Security\r\nCouncil. Let me briefly repeat the seven most important\r\npoints for the record.\r\nFirst, both the composition and the working methods\r\nof the Council will have to be changed in order to increase\r\nthe credibility and legitimacy of the United Nations in\r\ngeneral.\r\nSecond, as changes in the composition of the Council\r\nwill require amendments to the Charter, it is logical and\r\ndesirable that reform of the Council should have the\r\nbroadest possible support among Member States.\r\nThird, a careful balance must be struck between the\r\neffectiveness of the Council and the necessity to enhance\r\nits representative character. We hope that consensus can\r\nbe reached on a total number of seats somewhere in the\r\nlow twenties.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nFourth, the United Nations Charter indicates in\r\nArticle 23, appropriately, that eligibility for membership\r\nin the Council will depend in the first instance on\r\n\"the contribution of Members of the United\r\nNations to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and to the other purposes of\r\nthe Organization, and also to equitable\r\ngeographical distribution.\"\r\nFifth, these consequently, should be the criteria for\r\nnew membership. Without excluding other new members,\r\nmy country is therefore in favour of the admission of\r\nGermany and Japan as permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nSixth, the Netherlands would, in the context of an\r\nenlargement, have no objection in principle to an\r\namendment of paragraph 2 of Article 23 to create the\r\npossibility of re-election of Member States in\r\nnon-permanent seats in the Council.\r\nSeventh, enhanced transparency and closer\r\ncoordination between the Security Council and the United\r\nNations membership at large is of extreme importance.\r\nI wish to stress in this regard the urgent need for an\r\nimproved flow of information to and consultation with\r\ncountries participating in peace-keeping operations. We\r\nare prepared to participate actively in efforts to establish\r\nworkable mechanisms in this regard. Such improvements\r\nneed not wait until the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil takes place.\r\nMy delegation is looking forward to the continuation\r\nof the exchange of views in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup during this session of the General Assembly.\r\nConcrete proposals for reforming the Security Council\r\nwill be evaluated in the light of the foregoing key\r\nelements.\r\nThe Assembly can count on my delegation’s\r\ncooperation in finding lasting, equitable and fair solutions\r\nthat will help the Security Council carry out its important\r\nand challenging mandate in an ever- more-complex global\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\ncontext. In the consideration of this agenda item, my\r\ncountry will be guided by a desire to increase the\r\neffectiveness, efficiency, credibility and legitimacy of the\r\nSecurity Council in the interest of all United Nations\r\nMember States.\r\nMr. Abiola (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation\r\nwelcomes the opportunity to participate in this debate on\r\nthe important question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in membership of the Security Council. Nigeria\r\nhas always considered that the changes which have\r\noccurred on the international scene since the inception of\r\nour Organization, and which have crystallized especially\r\nsince the end of the cold war, seriously warrant a\r\nmodification in the composition and working methods of\r\nthe Security Council so that it will be better able to respond\r\neffectively to changed and changing circumstances. The\r\nUnited Nations, for which Member States have great\r\nexpectations and aspirations, would be failing in its duties\r\nand out of line with reality if it were unable to take\r\ncognizance of the mood of its membership relative to the\r\nnecessity for democratization and the transparency of its\r\nworking methods and of the need for this entire\r\nmembership to be better represented, particularly in the\r\nSecurity Council, the organ responsible for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nIn accordance with the preamble of the Charter, which\r\nadverts to \"We the peoples of the United Nations\", the\r\nSecurity Council must truly act and be seen to act on behalf\r\nof the peoples of the United Nations.\r\nThis is a compelling reason why the restructuring of\r\nthe Council must remain of primary interest and concern.\r\nIn the course of the past year particularly, renewed\r\nefforts have been made to address the various\r\nconsiderations which should have an impact on the eventual\r\ndetermination of the form, character and extent of the\r\nreview process. In this regard, Member States provided\r\nviewpoints which enabled the Open-ended Working Group,\r\nestablished by the General Assembly at the forty-eighth\r\nsession, to begin to address substantively the issues relating\r\nto the restructuring of the Council. The outcome of the\r\nefforts exerted thus far reveals the complexity and\r\nchallenges of the review process. It also testifies to the\r\nactive interest of all Member States on the subject.\r\nIn this endeavour, my delegation would like to pay a\r\nspecial tribute to Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who, in\r\nhis capacity as President of the General Assembly at the\r\nforty-eighth session, chaired the proceedings of the Open-\r\nended Working Group with distinction and effectiveness.\r\nHe was ably assisted by the Ambassadors of Finland and\r\nSingapore.\r\nAs a delegation we continue to believe that the\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council must be undertaken\r\nin a holistic rather than a piecemeal manner, since a\r\nreview must take into account the subjects of permanent\r\nand non-permanent membership; the methods of work,\r\nincluding the question of the transparency of the Security\r\nCouncil; and equitable geographical distribution of seats.\r\nIn considering the question of representation and an\r\nincrease in the membership of the Council, one cannot\r\nbut reiterate the singular absence of African representation\r\nin the permanent membership of the Council, despite the\r\ncontinent’s 53 Member States. As to the specific\r\nquestion of number, my delegation is flexible but believes\r\nthat, whatever final figure is reached, it must be\r\nconsistent with the principle of representativeness and\r\nequitable geographical distribution. My delegation does\r\nnot believe that we should create a status subordinate to\r\nthat of permanent member, nor do we support the idea of\r\nrotating permanent seats. In other words, we recognize\r\nand advocate the continuance of the present arrangement\r\nof permanent and non-permanent membership only.\r\nAll permanent members should enjoy the same status\r\nand privileges and assume the responsibilities incumbent\r\non membership. It is our opinion that the criteria for\r\npermanent membership on the Council should include\r\nsuch considerations as a country’s population, its capacity\r\nto contribute to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, and its track record, assessed over a period\r\nof time, in international peace-keeping and peace-making\r\nefforts.\r\nEnough concern has been expressed about the\r\nmodalities for bringing these changes into effect,\r\nincluding that of amending the relevant provisions of the\r\nCharter. My delegation believes that consideration of\r\nthese modalities should not be used as obstacles to\r\nproceeding with the review. Since it has been possible to\r\namend the Charter on previous occasions, we believe that\r\na subsequent review can adopt a similar procedure. In\r\nany case, there is a ground swell of support by the\r\ninternational community for an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council. All that is required\r\ntherefore is the political will and commitment on the part\r\nof Member States to translate this support into concrete\r\nreforms.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 October 1994\r\nIt is the hope of my delegation that at the current\r\nsession an appropriate resolution will be adopted, enabling\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group to continue its\r\nconsideration of the question with a view to reaching an\r\nearly conclusion. We urge Member States to show\r\nflexibility in the interest of international peace and security\r\nand of equity and justice.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): We have\r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nMembers will recall that by resolution 48/26 of\r\n3 December 1993 the General Assembly decided\r\n\"to establish an Open-ended Working Group to\r\nconsider all aspects of the question of increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, and other matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council\" (para. 1).\r\nHaving been formally established by the General\r\nAssembly, the Working Group is a subsidiary organ of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nFurthermore, by decision 48/498 of 14 September\r\n1994, the General Assembly decided that the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council should continue its work, taking into\r\naccount, inter alia, the views expressed at the forty-ninth\r\nsession, and submit a report to the General Assembly\r\nbefore the end of that session.\r\nBy the end of this meeting the Assembly will have\r\nheard the views expressed by many Member States. It is\r\nmy understanding that the Assembly wishes to confirm\r\nthat the Working Group should continue to consider all\r\naspects of the question of increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and other matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe Working Group is therefore in a position to\r\ncontinue its work in due course, at a date to be\r\nestablished by mutual agreement following consultations.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 33.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.25 p.m.\r\n20\r\n"
