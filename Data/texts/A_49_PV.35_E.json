(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 95\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family\r\nInternational Conference on Families\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): This\r\nmorning, the General Assembly, in accordance with the\r\ndecision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting and pursuant to its\r\nresolution 47/237 of 20 September 1993, will hold, under\r\nagenda item 95, the first of the plenary meetings devoted to\r\nthe implementation of the follow-up to the International\r\nYear of the Family, to be designated as the International\r\nConference on Families.\r\nI am pleased to welcome participants to this\r\nInternational Conference on Families.\r\nIn particular, it is my pleasure to extend a warm\r\nwelcome to the many Ministers and other senior policy-\r\nmakers who have travelled from their respective capitals to\r\nparticipate in this Conference. Their attendance is a most\r\nfitting response to the decision of the General Assembly\r\nlast year that this Conference should take place at an\r\nappropriate global policy-making level. Their presence\r\ntoday, just as this event itself does, is a tribute to families\r\nthroughout the world and a testimony to the importance and\r\nhigh priority that the global community attaches to families\r\nand to family issues in the process of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe International Conference on Families is taking\r\nplace at a time when humanity is facing a defining\r\nmoment for its common future. So too is the United\r\nNations. The realities, opportunities and challenges facing\r\nhuman civilization today present a vastly different picture\r\nthan in the last decade. Almost all spheres of human\r\nendeavour have been affected by this development — not\r\nsimply the basic aspects of daily life at the level of the\r\nindividual, of the family as the basic social unit, of the\r\ncommunity and national society, but also the global\r\ncommunity of nations in the broader socio-political\r\nspectrum.\r\nAs a result, the United Nations has begun to\r\nelaborate an increasingly refined and effective conceptual\r\nbase in order to cope with today’s realities in our\r\nendeavours in various spheres. We are on the verge of\r\ncrystallizing a development process centred on the human\r\nbeing, one that would integrate the various spheres of\r\nhuman activity into an interrelated but coherent whole and\r\nthat would include as its basic elements peace, sustainable\r\neconomic growth, environment, social justice, democracy\r\nand good governance.\r\nNumerous recent events and initiatives have greatly\r\ncontributed to this evolutionary process in their respective\r\nspheres and have played a significant role to this end. The\r\nsame will be true of other, forthcoming events, such as\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development.\r\n1\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nBy proclaiming 1994 the International Year of the\r\nFamily, the General Assembly acknowledged the significant\r\nrole that another essential element of society — the families\r\nas the basic social unit — could play in the context of this\r\nprocess.\r\nConsequently, for the first time in history, the\r\nAssembly also focused special attention on families as a\r\nsubject of social action, since it is both an agent and a\r\nbeneficiary of the development process and is\r\nadvantageously positioned at the crux of various problems\r\naffecting various social groups and sectors of activity.\r\nAs my predecessor stated last year when the Assembly\r\nheld a special meeting to launch the International Year of\r\nthe Family, the basic notion of the importance of families\r\nto society at all levels was laid at the foundation of the\r\ncreation of our United Nations.\r\nHowever, just as other socio-political institutions throughout\r\nthe world have been undergoing profound transformations,\r\nparticularly in recent years, the family, which is the most\r\nfundamental of social institutions, has also undergone great\r\nupheavals in an age that also gives it new opportunities and\r\nunprecedented challenges.\r\nOn the one hand, present-day socio-political realities\r\nhave heightened the importance and responsibilities of\r\nfamilies and have made their role even more vital. They\r\nalso reinforce the essential function of families in the\r\nbuilding of a just civil society and in our global efforts for\r\npeace and sustainable development. Faced, however, with\r\nrecent changes outside the family and the profound parallel\r\ntransformations in families themselves, the response of\r\nfamilies has varied from successful adaptation to total\r\nbreakdown.\r\nOn the other hand, one often sees negative behaviour\r\nand exploitation within the family. These are tolerated\r\nprecisely because of the intimate nature of family\r\nrelationships, and because of them all family members\r\ncannot enjoy their individual rights on an equal footing.\r\nHence, families as democratic social units remain an ideal\r\nthat does not correspond entirely to reality. This takes on\r\nadded significance because the family can be the foundation\r\nfor the well-being of individuals, societies and nations only\r\nwhen it is founded on principles of equality, the\r\ninviolability and equality of the rights and responsibilities\r\nof the individual, whether male or female, mutual respect,\r\nlove and tolerance.\r\nClearly, the current state of the world’s families is\r\na vital factor that can influence the pace of social\r\nprogress and development. It is essential that society,\r\nwithout delay, support families in meeting their needs and\r\nfulfilling their functions, that it foster further positive\r\nchanges within families and that it reinforce the role of\r\nthe family as the fundamental place of learning and of the\r\nexercise of values, rights, responsibilities and democracy.\r\nAs the International Conference on Families opens,\r\nthe international community is fast approaching the\r\ncompletion of the first phase of its important efforts to\r\ngive the family greater consideration. In proclaiming the\r\nInternational Year of the Family, the General Assembly\r\nset as one of its main objectives an increased awareness,\r\namong both policy makers and the general public, of the\r\nunique role played by families. Great strides have been\r\nmade in fulfilling this objective. The Year has made it\r\npossible to make the subject of the family an essential\r\ncomponent of the concept of development and of\r\ninternational dialogue on that issue.\r\nThere is no doubt that the Year has made it possible\r\nto redefine some fundamental concepts related to the\r\nfamily. For example, it has been acknowledged that social\r\npolicies must respond to holistic, family-centred\r\nprinciples; that many of the crucial problems facing\r\nfamilies and States, however diverse they might be, are\r\nmanifested in the same way in all regions and all\r\ncountries; that the Year is only the first step in a long\r\nprocess of support for families; and that international\r\ncooperation is essential in dealing with family-related\r\nissues.\r\nWe have also seen that an especially constructive\r\napproach to family-related problems has come about in\r\nthe course of the Year. There has been a consistent effort\r\nto ensure that the activities of the Year at all levels be\r\ncharacterized, first, by recognition of the diversity of\r\nfamily life and the principle of pluralism in the\r\nfunctioning of families; secondly, by emphasis on gender\r\nequality in society and the family; and, thirdly, the major\r\nimportance attached to the rights of children. As a result,\r\nthere is a growing awareness of the absolute\r\nindispensability of addressing family-related issues and\r\nbringing about positive changes in families, because this\r\nis essential for the achievement of significant and\r\nsustainable progress in the global effort on behalf of\r\nwomen, children and other disadvantaged members of\r\nsociety.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nConsidering the manner in which, over the space of\r\njust a few years, and thanks to the assiduous efforts devoted\r\nto it, the Year has grown from a small bud into full\r\nmaturity, one cannot but conclude that the basic strategy for\r\nthe Year has been effectively carried out through the\r\nconcerted efforts of the international community, in\r\nharmony with a large number of partners playing a crucial\r\nrole. Evidence of this includes the active involvement of\r\nsome 150 Member States, national authorities at the highest\r\nlevel, numerous organs of the United Nations and of other\r\nintergovernmental organizations, hundreds of national and\r\ninternational non-governmental organizations, academic\r\ncommunities, the private sector and thousands of\r\nenthusiastic volunteers all over the world. The decision to\r\nfocus the Year’s activities at the national and local levels\r\nhas also contributed much to the success of the Year, since\r\nit has been effectively supported by numerous regional and\r\nglobal measures, such as the four regional preparatory\r\nmeetings and the world Non-Governmental Organization\r\nForum launching the Year. The resources mobilized through\r\nthe Voluntary Fund for the Year, as well as through in-kind\r\ncontributions, have proven to be vital. The various phases\r\nof the observances of the Year have also included well-\r\nconceived promotional and public-information strategies and\r\nactivities. But all this is just a beginning. The hard work\r\nof mobilizing energies and striving for more sustained\r\nactivities still lies ahead of us.\r\nI wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to our numerous\r\npartners in the International Year of the Family for their\r\neffective action and their financial and in-kind\r\ncontributions. Both the preparatory phase and the\r\nobservance of the Year have been orchestrated by the\r\nsecretariat of the Year, which has effectively played the\r\nroles of catalyst, promoter and coordinator of national and\r\ninternational efforts.\r\nAllow me also to express, on behalf of the Assembly,\r\ndeepest gratitude to the Secretary-General and warmest\r\ncongratulations on his outstanding work in this area, taking\r\nparticular account of the technical complexities of the\r\nsubject, the chronic lack of resources and the fact that the\r\nsecretariat of the Year is one of the smallest units ever\r\ncharged with the global coordination of an international\r\nevent of this magnitude. We must welcome this example of\r\ngood management of resources and rationalization of work.\r\nThe successes achieved by the International Year of\r\nthe Family, impressive as they already are, also set high\r\nstandards for this Conference. Last year the Assembly\r\ndecided to devote the Conference to the implementation of\r\nthe follow-up activities to the Year. Through deliberations\r\nwith regard to the Year, Member States should be able to\r\narticulate even more solid principles on which to base our\r\nfuture action for the family. We should provide a clear\r\ndirection for such action and begin to mark out its\r\nmodalities and priorities. The General Assembly has\r\nrequested that the secretariat submit a draft plan of action\r\non the family at the Assembly’s fiftieth session, and our\r\ndeliberations should also be a very useful instrument in\r\nthe accomplishment of that task.\r\nIn short, this Conference should set the stage for\r\naction to be taken in the long term. The task is an\r\nextremely difficult one, but we owe our best effort to all\r\nthe families of the world.\r\nI now call on the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who\r\nwishes to address the General Assembly at this time.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Five years ago, the General\r\nAssembly decided that 1994 was to be the International\r\nYear of the Family.\r\nAt the time, there was no consensus. Some did not\r\nsee the point of an International Year of the Family.\r\nOpinions were divided as to what the Year was about.\r\nSome people argued that support for the family\r\ndiscriminates against those who prefer to live outside\r\nfamily units. There were also disagreements over the\r\nactivities which should be organized to mark the year.\r\nAnd so, in my speech last December to launch this\r\nInternational Year, I urged that we concentrate on\r\npractical outcomes: the Year should result in concrete\r\nmeasures to strengthen the situation of the family around\r\nthe world.\r\nToday I can report that a great deal of practical\r\naction is indeed being taken, and more is planned. But I\r\ncan also report that in one key respect this International\r\nYear of the Family has already exceeded expectations.\r\nThe International Year of the Family has stimulated\r\na worldwide debate. Many political notions have been\r\nclarified. Out of the process of debate and reflection have\r\ncome new insights.\r\nInstead of confusion and hesitation, there is now\r\nconsensus about the role of the family in human society.\r\nToday, a new realism prevails. It is accepted that the\r\nfamily is a fundamental institution of human society.\r\nIndeed, it is established that society is a structure made\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nup of families and individuals related to society, in the first\r\ninstance, through families.\r\nViews may differ about what an ideal family should\r\nbe like -indeed, families themselves vary greatly. But there\r\ncan be no doubt as to the importance of the family. Like\r\nthe State, the nation and this world Organization itself, the\r\nfamily is a living, functioning organism, which has to cope\r\nwith the many profound changes which are occurring in the\r\nworld.\r\nIt has also been recognized that families have many\r\nneeds and that in many societies families are under stress.\r\nThey face serious economic and social difficulties. Families\r\nshould therefore receive the full protection and support of\r\nsociety and the State -going well beyond broad statements\r\nof principle. Families need tangible assistance through\r\npolicies, programmes and services.\r\nIt is clear that all areas of social policy affect families.\r\nBut families also need support. Policies should therefore be\r\nmade sensitive to the situation of families. The aim must be\r\nto empower families to fulfil all their roles and functions in\r\nsociety.\r\nThe debate about the role of the family has coincided\r\nwith the process of rethinking the role of the United\r\nNations in development. The two have overlapped, and, as\r\na result, it is now generally accepted that action to support\r\nfamilies is an important component of the development\r\neffort generally.\r\nThis new awareness of the centrality of families to\r\ndevelopment issues has vast implications. Families are\r\nmajor actors in and beneficiaries of the sustainable\r\ndevelopment process. Without the participation of families\r\nin the development process, it cannot succeed. As producers\r\nand as educators, families play a significant role in human\r\ndevelopment. In these and in many other ways, families are\r\nthe primary mechanisms through which the human\r\ncommunity achieves its ends.\r\nFamilies are universally recognized as important actors\r\nin education. Their role in health cannot be disputed. They\r\nare the building blocks of communities and cities. The\r\nimportance of families for the well-being and development\r\nof children is a point of long-standing, universal consensus.\r\nThe decisions taken in families are at the centre of such\r\nquestions as population growth, economic development and\r\nenvironmental protection. Behaviour and attitudes in\r\nfamilies crucially influence approaches to gender equality.\r\nFamilies provide an integrated focus for many\r\ndevelopment problems. A focus on families helps to build\r\nbridges between disciplines, policy sectors and\r\nprofessions. It shows clearly how different development\r\nissues are interconnected. It provides a mechanism for\r\ncoherent action at the basic level of human life.\r\nFamilies also provide an operational approach to the\r\nintegration of human rights into the conduct of everyday\r\nlife. The family is the first and primary conduit for\r\nhuman rights education. Our roles in society and in public\r\nlife are formed as children in families. Children raised in\r\na family where tolerance and gender equality are practised\r\nwill have the best human rights education. The experience\r\nof fairness and social justice provides the best assurance\r\nthat these values will be sought in the greater society.\r\nThe International Year has been productive in\r\nanother sense. It has shown that the international\r\ncommunity can mobilize action at the grass-roots level\r\nand find unity of purpose in a pluralistic world. The Year\r\nof the Family is proof of a new political will and a new\r\ncapacity for solving global problems through the basic\r\nunits of society.\r\nIntergovernmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations have rallied to support the Year. They have\r\nbegun long-term processes of benefit to families. The\r\nhallmark of the Year has been the involvement of the full\r\nspectrum of professional groups. The Year has also drawn\r\nguidance from an array of disciplines. It has been an\r\ninitiative built on partnership. Its strength testifies to the\r\npower of a family focus. Its global appeal derives from\r\nthe universal significance of families to the human\r\nexperience.\r\nThrough the International Year of the Family —\r\nfrom the United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, the World Conference on Human Rights\r\nand the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment — new insights, new principles and a new\r\nvision are emerging.\r\nNext year we observe the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. The year 1995 will also see the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and the World\r\nConference on Women at Beijing. This will be a time for\r\nreflection and thinking, especially about development\r\nissues.\r\nThe challenge now is to ensure that the momentum\r\ngained in the course of the preparation and observance of\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nthe Year is maintained. Mechanisms for future action are\r\nalready in place. National coordinating bodies have been a\r\ncatalytic force in mobilizing action in countries all around\r\nthe world. Some Governments have acted already. Some\r\nhave set up ministries with a specific mandate for family\r\npolicy.\r\nFrom its heights to its most basic level the human\r\nfamily must be united in its dedication to a sustainable\r\nfuture for all people. The International Year of the Family\r\nhas provided a starting-point.\r\nLooking back over the past few years it now seems\r\nextraordinary that the importance of the family as a human\r\ninstitution should ever have been regarded as controversial.\r\nBut it is now clear that there has been a geological change\r\nin political attitudes.\r\nToday, it is recognized that the family is a key\r\ninstitution in the social structure of every human society.\r\nIndeed, precisely because of its importance, opinions\r\ndiffered as to the role, function and future of the family.\r\nToday, in a new spirit of pragmatism, the world is\r\nacknowledging the importance of families. Allow me,\r\ntherefore, to conclude with a statement attributed to\r\nConfucius, who wrote:\r\n“When there is love in the marriage, there is\r\nharmony in the home; when there is harmony in the\r\nhome, there is contentment in the community; when\r\nthere is contentment in the community, there is\r\nprosperity in the nation; when there is prosperity in\r\nthe nation, there is peace in the world.”\r\nThe United Nations will honour the many\r\naccomplishments of the Year. The United Nations will\r\ncontinue to support families at the international level.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I thank\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations for his\r\nstatement.\r\nBefore calling on the next speaker, I should like to\r\npropose that the list of speakers at the International\r\nConference on Families be closed today at 11 a.m.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\ntherefore request those representatives wishing to participate\r\nin the International Conference on Families to inscribe their\r\nnames on the list as soon as possible.\r\nI now call upon Her Excellency Dr. Amal Osman,\r\nMinister of Social Insurance and Social Affairs of Egypt.\r\nMrs. Osman (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 44/82 of 1989, which\r\ndesignated 1994 as the International Year of the Family,\r\nreflected awareness of the fact that the family is the\r\nprincipal underpinning of society and the foundation of its\r\ndevelopment and progress. The United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies have played a pioneering role in\r\nprotecting and supporting the family and in mobilizing\r\ninternational cooperation in its support in the economic,\r\nsocial, cultural and public health areas. The United\r\nNation’s international conferences have highlighted the\r\nrole of the family and adopted international strategies and\r\nprogrammes of action whose aim has been the\r\nstrengthening of the moral foundations of the family and\r\nthe enhancement of its economic capabilities.\r\nThe Cairo International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, the latest of those conferences, stressed\r\nthe role of the family with its Programme of Action,\r\nwhich was adopted by unprecedented consensus. The\r\nProgramme underscored the need to strengthen the\r\ncapabilities of women and the importance of their\r\nempowerment and integration in the programmes of\r\ncomprehensive development and focused on the\r\nimportance of education, health, culture and other services\r\nthat are needed to promote the family at the social and\r\neconomic levels. Chapter V of the Programme of Action\r\nalso stressed the role and rights of the family as the\r\nnucleus of society and the foundation of its progress and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nNon-governmental organizations such as the\r\nInternational Union of Family Organizations have\r\nundertaken ambitious projects at the international, regional\r\nand local levels to prepare for the International Year of\r\nthe Family. Egypt has played an active part in all the\r\nactivities relating to the International Year. We have\r\nparticipated in the Cyprus Conference in 1991 on the\r\nsocial rights of families, the 1992 Conference in Poland\r\non the legal rights of the family and the 1992 Brazil\r\nConference on the economic rights of the family, and, in\r\n1993, we were happy to host a conference on the cultural\r\nrights of the family in Cairo under the chairmanship of\r\nMrs. Suzanne Mubarak, the President’s wife.\r\nWe in Egypt have taken special interest in this event\r\nand in all the activities relating to it. We have not been\r\ncontent to use it merely as an occasion for exchanging\r\ncultural exchanges or information training, but have made\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nit a concrete tangible reality that would impact on each and\r\nevery family in every Egyptian city, village and governorate\r\nthrough the establishment of the Advisory Committee on\r\nthe Family which I have had the honour of chairing. The\r\nCommittee, which had among its members a number of\r\nexperts and specialists in all areas relating to the family,\r\nwas concerned with the formulation of policies and\r\nstrategies at the national level. A number of technical\r\nsubcommittees at the local level have been entrusted with\r\nthe local implementation of such policies and strategies.\r\nI do not intend to speak at length of our successes in\r\nthis field, but I should like to focus on two of them.\r\nThe first success was in the social-security area. We\r\nhave expanded the social-security umbrella to cover every\r\nEgyptian citizen, whether he or she works inside or outside\r\nthe country, and thus we have guaranteed for the Egyptian\r\nfamily its present and future security. This year, the number\r\nof those who benefit from this direct type of insurance has\r\nrisen, as at 30 June 1994 to 15.9 million. In the past\r\nfinancial year 5.4 million Egyptian pounds were paid out in\r\npensions and compensations to nearly 6.7 million people.\r\nThese legislative and other specific measures are evidence\r\nof the emphasis we lay on the need to protect the\r\nindividual, the family and society, without distinction\r\nbetween men and women, against the hardships and hazards\r\nof old age, disability, death of the breadwinner, work-place\r\ninjuries, unemployment, pregnancy and child birth. Among\r\nthe most important schemes of insurance coverage are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n— Social-security insurance has been expanded. This\r\ninsurance covers government, public and private sector\r\nworkers under the provisions of law 79 of 1975. On\r\n13 June 1994, the number of those insured under the\r\nscheme was almost 9 million.\r\n— Social-security insurance covering employers and\r\nsuch categories under law 108 of 1977 now covers nearly\r\n503,000 according to the figures of the past financial year.\r\n— Social-security insurance covering Egyptians\r\nworking abroad under law 51 of 1978 now covers 54,000\r\npersons.\r\n— Social-security insurance covering street vendors\r\nand seasonal workers in agriculture, fishing, domestic\r\nservices and other areas under law 112 of 1980 now covers\r\nnearly 5.4 million citizens.\r\nOur other success to which I should like to refer\r\nconcerns productive families. This is a means of\r\nintegrated development that aims at transforming the\r\nfamily unit into a productive unit capable of adapting to\r\neconomic and social changes through redoubling the\r\nfamily’s financial skills and capabilities. The project now\r\napplies to 900,000 families, with a waiting list of\r\n1 million families which want to join the scheme.\r\nWe in Egypt can pride ourselves today on our\r\nsuccess in developing our disposable potential local and\r\nenvironmental resources and turning them into end\r\nproducts with added economic value. We have succeeded\r\nin steering social conduct towards individual and family\r\nawareness of the social value of productive behaviour. In\r\naddition, we have managed to preserve authentic Egyptian\r\ncrafts and industries while developing the types,\r\ncomponents and raw materials of their products. Proof of\r\nthe success of this endeavour can be seen in 34\r\npermanent exhibitions of family products. Such\r\nexhibitions have been organized also in Europe, in Africa\r\nand, more recently, in Latin America.\r\nIn his statement to the General Assembly at the\r\ncurrent session Egypt’s Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nMr. Amr Moussa, emphasized the importance we attach\r\nto social development and its universality and to the\r\npromotion of the role of the United Nations in this field.\r\nHe also stressed that we should like to see the social\r\ndimension given priority in international life. Proceeding\r\nfrom this, we shall take part in the preparatory activities\r\nfor international conferences which will address social\r\nissues.\r\nI should like to refer in particular to the World\r\nSummit on Social Development, the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women and the Second United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements. The Copenhagen\r\nSummit will deal with the struggle against the three-\r\npronged problem of poverty, unemployment and social\r\nintegration. The Beijing Summit will be aimed at enabling\r\nwomen, who constitute 50 per cent of society, to enjoy\r\ntheir rights and to increase their skills in the interests of\r\nprogress and peace. The Istanbul Conference will be\r\naimed at improving circumstances relating to human\r\nsettlements. Special attention will be paid to the\r\nvulnerable sectors of society, beginning with women.\r\nThose Conferences are all links in the long and\r\nwider context of social development in its fullest\r\nmeaning. Such development can be achieved only through\r\nthe development of the family and the strengthening of its\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nfoundations. The family, no matter how it may be viewed\r\nculturally, is a constant of social organization, an enduring\r\ninstitutional reality and a productive economic unit. That\r\nbeing the case, all Governments and international,\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations\r\nshould protect and promote that unit.\r\nAs the purpose of this debate is to support and\r\nconsolidate international cooperation with the aim of\r\ndeveloping and promoting the role of the family, we are\r\nrequired to set up an international programme of action\r\nwith clear objectives, that would lend itself to division into\r\nshort-term and long-term stages. Such a plan of action\r\nshould be formulated in a manner that would ensure\r\nacceptance and participation by all governments, individuals\r\nand international and national organizations under the\r\numbrella of the United Nations and its Economic and Social\r\nCouncil with all its subsidiary organs.\r\nEconomic, political and cultural changes throughout\r\nthe world have impacted directly on the everyday life of the\r\nfamily and will affect its prospects in the near and distant\r\nfuture. That being the case, it is unthinkable that we should\r\ntry to bring about the emergence of tomorrow’s world and\r\nto ensure and consolidate balance in international political\r\nand economic relations without making the nucleus of\r\nstability and balance — namely, the family, the starting\r\npoint of our endeavours. That is to say, the protection of\r\nthe family and the preservation of its enduring cultural and\r\nmaterial components is our collective responsibility at the\r\nlocal, national and international levels. It is undeniable that,\r\nin this respect, governments have a direct responsibility and\r\nan increasingly important role to play.\r\nGiven the international interest in the family, we must\r\ntake concrete and serious action at the international level.\r\nStates and donor organizations — especially the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other\r\nfinancial institutions — must provide the wherewithal to\r\nstrengthen the productive capacity of families in a manner\r\nthat would be commensurate with the requirements of\r\neconomic restructuring in certain societies and with the\r\nchallenges of the free market economy in other societies.\r\nGovernments must act as good conductors that ensure the\r\nswift transfer of international technological and financial\r\nassistance to their societies. Non-governmental\r\norganizations are required to strengthen the decentralization\r\nof national and international action on behalf of the family\r\nand through the family.\r\nFrom this rostrum, we call once again for a formula\r\nof cooperation that would lead to peace, progress and\r\nprosperity for the international community as a whole —\r\nwithout distinction between cultures, regimes or levels of\r\nwealth — in the interests of the social peace, progress\r\nand prosperity of the basic nucleus of society, namely, the\r\nfamily.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nnow on the representative of Uruguay, Mrs. Burmester de\r\nMaynard, Director of the National Institute for the Family\r\nand Women.\r\nMrs. Burmester de Maynard (Uruguay)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): From the very beginning of\r\nits history as a nation, Uruguay has demonstrated a firm\r\ncommitment to social issues, a commitment which has\r\nshaped our concerns and actions. Initially, our actions\r\nwere focused on strong State intervention, based on the\r\nnotion of social policies as an integrating factor. That type\r\nof intervention, characterized by a virtual State monopoly\r\non the supplying of social services, was designed more to\r\nconsolidate a common identity as a mechanism for\r\nensuring equal opportunity than to achieve uniform results\r\nas a strategy for combating poverty.\r\nBecause of the characteristics of Uruguayan society\r\nat that time, “positive discrimination” — to use a\r\ncontemporary term — was not thought to be an effective\r\nway of making opportunities available to the masses, or\r\nof ensuring equal treatment and uniform results. From a\r\nlegislative standpoint, since the beginning of this century\r\nUruguay has made significant social progress in the\r\nrealms of labour, politics and civil rights. I shall now\r\nendeavour to describe recent years’ progress in the\r\nelaboration of family-service policies.\r\nIn that connection, the thrust of my Government’s\r\nefforts has been fourfold:\r\nFirst, in 1991, we established under the aegis of the\r\nMinistry of Education and Culture, the National Institute\r\nfor the Family and Women to administer Government\r\npolicies in that sphere. The creation of that Institute has\r\nhad a strong impact on society as a whole. The Institute’s\r\npermanent status and the resources allocated to it attest to\r\nmy Government’s commitment.\r\nSecondly, in April 1994, with a view to lending\r\npermanence, continuity and consistency, rather than mere\r\npolitical change, to the relevant public policies, the\r\nGovernment of Uruguay established the National\r\nCommission on the Family. Its pluralistic membership\r\nincludes eminent experts and in this first year of\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nmanagement the Commission is already demonstrating its\r\nability to come up with proposals on concrete issues\r\naffecting families and, therefore, each and every\r\nUruguayan.\r\nThose proposals — or institutional options — involve\r\nintervention at various levels; they reflect a new\r\nrelationship between society and the State. They are geared\r\nto providing families with better social services, thanks to\r\ninstitutional coordination and the support of the entire State\r\napparatus.\r\nThe Government of Uruguay has committed itself to\r\nUruguayan families, to each of every one of their members,\r\nlaying special emphasis on the most vulnerable sectors of\r\nthe population: women, children, adolescents and the aged.\r\nUruguay has a high life expectancy; senior citizens are thus\r\namong our target groups. In order to maximize our social\r\nservices, we seek the input of all recipient groups by\r\nproviding them with a forum in which to voice their\r\nexpectations, needs and demands.\r\nTo that end, in 1990, the Government adopted a\r\nnational plan of action for social policies, with\r\ngovernmental experts and the private sector joining together\r\nin a pluralistic and participatory framework. We have also\r\nestablished a comprehensive and integrated programme of\r\nsocial policies, based mainly on labour, cultural and\r\neducational guidelines, to deal with the difficulties faced by\r\nfamilies in adapting to the rapid changes and deep\r\ntransformations affecting them.\r\nThe National Institute for the Family and Women and\r\nthe National Commission for the Family are part of a\r\ncomprehensive policy aimed at maximizing the efficiency\r\nof our social service apparatus. They were created not to\r\ncompete institutionally with the traditional public policy\r\nadministrators, which would make them redundant, but to\r\nenhance public policy by integrating its various\r\ndimensions — the family, gender and the State — and by\r\ncoordinating existing programmes and tailoring education,\r\nhealth, employment and social security policies to the\r\nspecific requirements of each sector of the population, with\r\nparticular emphasis on the family.\r\nPrince Sisowath Sirirath (Cambodia), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nTo ensure that maximum benefit accrues to the target\r\ngroup, programmes have been planned, designed, executed,\r\nimplemented and evaluated based on thorough research and\r\non an analysis of the dynamics of the family unit.\r\nThirdly, within the scope of the Office for Planning\r\nand Budget and under the aegis of the Presidency of the\r\nRepublic, a new mechanism — a social infrastructure\r\nprogramme — has been created. One of its tasks is to\r\nfine-tune social policies so as to ensure optimum results.\r\nIt also serves as a think-tank for the analysis and\r\nformulation of policies pertaining to food, education and\r\nhealth.\r\nThese three organs have demonstrated an innovative\r\napproach to social policies and made the priority needs of\r\nfamilies — in particular, families which are socially the\r\nmost vulnerable — the subject of decision-making at the\r\nhighest levels of government.\r\nA fourth avenue of coordination has surely been the\r\nSocial Cabinet, established in 1991 and composed of\r\nexperts in social legislation. A national plan of action,\r\nsubmitted by the National Institute for the Family and\r\nWomen, was adopted by the Social Cabinet in May 1992.\r\nThe plan embraced six main categories: education, health,\r\nemployment, human rights, legislation and the\r\nenvironment. Each category has specific programmes.\r\nThere being as many as 40, I shall not enumerate them.\r\nThe six main categories, in turn, have eight\r\ninterrelated programmes of action covering high-risk\r\npriority items to be dealt with in the five-year period\r\nwhich began in May 1992.These include: women and\r\nfamilies suffering critical poverty; children in particularly\r\ndifficult situations; teen-age mothers; rural women and\r\nfamilies; the elderly; families and gender; the disabled;\r\nand victims of domestic violence.\r\nSix operational programmes complete the plan: the\r\nestablishment of offices in the various regions of the\r\ncountry, information centres to publicize the rights of\r\nwomen and the family, specialized libraries, activity\r\nrooms and databases. Most important of all, though, is\r\nour training programme, which allows us to make use of\r\nour human resources. Given the fact that we have this\r\ntype of cross-sectoral policy, this has become the most\r\nimportant tool at our disposal.\r\nTwo and a half years after its adoption the plan is 75\r\nper cent operative, with 34 specific programmes under\r\nway. Those programmes include: the opening of\r\ninformation centres throughout the country; measures to\r\ncombat domestic violence, which already have had a\r\nprofound impact on families; the establishment of a\r\nCentre for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and\r\nAssistance to its Victims; the training of public officials,\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nand of personnel for the police, emergency medical services\r\nand the Centre for the Prevention of Domestic Violence;\r\nthe creation of a hospice for the victims of violence;\r\nresearch and an interactive radio programme; measures to\r\ncombat child prostitution; the promotion of coeducation and\r\nnon-sexist education; public awareness and advocacy,\r\ncovering more than 23,000 direct beneficiaries and 960\r\nindirect beneficiaries.\r\nProgrammes on the following topics are still in the\r\nresearch-and-analysis stage: job placement; rural women\r\nand families; teen-age mothers; heads of household; and\r\nintergenerational poverty.\r\nThat prompts the following remarks on the family.\r\nIf we continue to accept the present discrepancy\r\nbetween the actual and the ideal, we shall be sending a\r\nmixed message to children and adolescents, as well as to\r\nadults, that will only reinforce stereotypes, impose rigid\r\nmodels and, therefore, undermine the accepted concept of\r\nthe family.\r\nIf families today continue to aspire to unrealistic goals,\r\nit will gradually destroy the basic structure of social\r\nrelations, the family; it would clearly be a step backwards.\r\nThe stereotype of the traditional family — in which the\r\nman is the breadwinner, or at least the principal provider —\r\nis being eroded by the growing acceptance of\r\nunconventional, more open and, therefore, less stable\r\nrelationships. That instability often results in the absence of\r\nan adequate role model for the children.\r\nMuch has been written about the need to define the\r\nrole of the family in society. Current changes in society —\r\nnotably the participation of women in the public sector and\r\nin the labour market — are transforming the family. But\r\nwhy not approach the problem and transform the world\r\nfrom the perspective of the family?\r\nOn the day when the National Commission for the\r\nFamily was established, the President of the Commission,\r\nMrs. Maria Julia Pou de Lacalle, and wife of the President\r\nof the Republic, issued this challenge: Let us not allow the\r\nfamily to become the prisoner of changes in society. Let the\r\nfamily decide what changes it wants in society.\r\nThat challenge implies pro-active families — families\r\nthat take responsibility for their actions — families that\r\nshape events rather than yield passively to them — families\r\nthat contribute to society with all their vigour and with all\r\nthe wisdom derived from their heterogeneity. Let that be\r\nour challenge.\r\nWe have just come from Cairo, where we\r\ncontributed our perspectives and our vision; onward now\r\nto the social Summit in Beijing. Let us transform society:\r\nthe private sector, the public sector, the family. Let us\r\nbuild a world that will include and recognize each and\r\nevery one of us — a world in which we recognize\r\nourselves — a world to which we feel we belong, where\r\nmen and women, young and old, can begin to reassess\r\ntheir relationships, their roles, their attitudes towards\r\ndecision-making and towards access to and control over\r\nresources. Let us be realistic: Goals that are not based on\r\nreality are, by definition, mere aspirations; they cannot be\r\nachieved.\r\nWith support by its relevant institutions, the\r\nGovernment of Uruguay has commemorated this\r\nInternational Year of the Family with deeds and\r\nachievements. We hail the initiative of the United Nations\r\nin proclaiming 1994 the International Year of the Family\r\nand in holding this International Conference on Families,\r\nwhich will enable us to have a fruitful and enriching\r\nexchange.\r\nThese conclaves allow us to renew our strength and\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the family, which is\r\nuppermost in our minds and in our daily actions. Our\r\ngreat challenge is to adapt family structures and dynamics\r\nso that the family becomes an agent for change. By\r\nstrengthening the family we shall be strengthening society\r\nitself. Indeed, by giving priority to human values idealism\r\nand sharing, we shall be ensuring our very future.\r\nLet me conclude by quoting a great contemporary\r\nUruguayan poet, Graciela Genta de Fernandez, who has\r\nalways struck a receptive chord in us and in the words of\r\nanother contemporary poet, Sylvia Puentes de Oyenard,\r\ngiven us time to live and to dream. In these few lines\r\nfrom one of her celebrated poems she reflects upon the\r\nworld, freedom, openness, spontaneity, frontiers, and the\r\nobstacles that divide us; she gives us a new sense of hope\r\nand creativity and lends a new dimension to life, to\r\ncommitment and to love. Our policies must always be\r\ninspired by those values.\r\n“I wish to leave you a world of doves in flight, of\r\nopen paths, of children’s smiles, a world without\r\nfrontiers, of brotherhood, where the word ’friend’\r\nmeans something. I wish to leave you a world of\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nhopes and dreams, a vast horizon that is never empty.”\r\nThe President: I now call on the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Turkey, Mr. Batu.\r\nMr. Batu (Turkey): I have the honour and pleasure of\r\nspeaking today on agenda item 95, the follow-up of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family, which has been observed\r\nby this Organization to underline the meaning of the family\r\nas a fundamental unit of society.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to submit some\r\ninformation regarding the preparatory process for this event\r\nin Turkey, which is clearly an expression of the broad\r\ninterest of our people and Government in this initiative.\r\nOngoing economic and social changes around the\r\nglobe with transcending human effects have an enormous\r\nimpact on the family as an institutionand its members. At\r\na time when we have been living through an era of radical\r\nchange, I believe the proclamation of the International Year\r\nof the Family has been a timely and appropriate occasion\r\nin order to reflect the moral values preserved by the family\r\nand the vital functions it fulfils. It has also been a useful\r\nopportunity for the international community to demonstrate\r\nits commitment to the role of the family in all walks of life.\r\nThe family is the fundamental source of social well-\r\nbeing and the stability of society. At the same time it is a\r\nforce for progress in so far as we, as universal human\r\nsociety, succeed in promoting its dynamic structure by\r\neffectively furthering its social, legal and economic rights\r\nas a whole and the rights of its members as human beings.\r\nOnly then will we be able to strengthen the dynamic\r\npotential of the family to reproduce its functions. Protecting\r\nthe family and enhancing its role in society can only be\r\nattained by taking into consideration all aspects thus paving\r\nthe way for the prosperity and well-being of future\r\ngenerations.\r\nIt is in this spirit that my country has approached the\r\nInternational Year of the Family and celebrated it with the\r\nfollowing activities.\r\nThe reports on overall activities concerning the\r\nInternational Year of the Family prepared by the specialized\r\ncommissions that had been established by the National\r\nCommittee, were disseminated and presented in a book.\r\nFurthermore, nine different research programmes on various\r\naspects of family problems have been completed in\r\ncooperation with the universities, and three of these have\r\nbeen published by the Turkish Family Research Institution.\r\nThat non-governmental organization also launched this\r\nyear the Family and Society Magazine, which is being\r\npublished on a regular basis.\r\nVarious educational programmes were carried out in\r\ncooperation with the Turkish National Broadcasting\r\nCompany. Numerous informative announcements and 40\r\ndrama series examining Turkish family life were\r\nbroadcast on our television. Thousands of posters, as well\r\nas other promotional material displaying information and\r\nemblems of the International Year of the Family, were\r\ndistributed throughout the country to enhance public\r\nawareness.\r\nIn order to focus the attention of our society on this\r\nevent new practical means have been used. In this context\r\nNational Lottery tickets with the International Year of the\r\nFamily logo printed on them were presented to the public\r\non 9 May. In addition, low-income families with newborn\r\nbabies are being supplied with an educational audio\r\ncassette series in collaboration with maternity hospitals.\r\nEnvelopes and stamps have been printed by the General\r\nDirectorate of Postal Services with the logo and slogans\r\nof International Family Day.\r\nIn order to spread the meaning of the 1994\r\nInternational Year of the Family throughout the country,\r\ninstructions were given to provincial governors requesting\r\nthe wide dissemination of the information on the\r\nobjectives and principles of the event.\r\nInternational Family Day, 15 May, was celebrated in\r\nour capital with the participation of various social\r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations, while\r\nin several other cities entertainment programmes were\r\norganized and performed.\r\nMeanwhile, activities with regard to the formation of\r\nthe Second Family Council have begun. Additional\r\ntelevision dramas on family life are being prepared, some\r\nof them with the cooperation of the Ministry of Culture.\r\nSeveral projects for Family Week, 10 to 16 October 1994,\r\nhave been organized, and the fourth issue of Family and\r\nSociety magazine will be a special issue dedicated to the\r\nInternational Year of the Family.\r\nIn summary, I am happy to note that the\r\nInternational Year of the Family has provided a valuable\r\nopportunity for us to increase the level of awareness on\r\nthe part of policy-making mechanisms at the local and the\r\nnational level and to reassess our legislation with the aim\r\nof clarifying its potential impact on families. It has further\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nencouraged us to explore new horizons for the promotion\r\nand protection of the family.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to extend our best wishes\r\nfor the full success of the International Year of the Family.\r\nI am confident that the Year will constitute an important\r\nbasis for activities in the social field and on human rights\r\nmatters in the future, carrying us into the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The observance of the Year will also be a\r\nsignificant prelude to important events such as the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and the fourth World\r\nConference on Women, the work of which will directly\r\nconcern the family as an institution and all its members as\r\nindividuals.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on Her Excellency, Mrs. Nebiha Gueddana, President\r\nand Director General of the National Office of Family and\r\nPopulation of Tunisia.\r\nMs. Gueddana (Tunisia) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI am grateful for this opportunity to address the Assembly.\r\nI have the honour today, near the end of the International\r\nYear of the Family, to present on behalf of the Republic of\r\nTunisia an overview of our experience in the area of family\r\npolicy, and to explain why Tunisia has chosen to address its\r\nvarious aspects.\r\nSince the early days of independence, in 1956,\r\nTunisian family policy has been characterized by coherence\r\nand comprehensiveness. It focused on all members of the\r\nfamily at the legislative, economic, social, cultural and\r\neducational levels. The intention was to preserve the family\r\nunit and ensure its prosperity in order for it to be able to\r\npositively interact with society — and continue to be its\r\nprincipal nucleus.\r\nIn order for us to achieve that end, it was necessary to\r\nset up an appropriate legislative and legal framework which\r\nwould make it possible to translate into concrete reality the\r\noptions Tunisia elected earlier. The start was the\r\npromulgation in 1956 of the Personal Statute Code, which\r\nlaid down the solid foundations of family relationships\r\nwithin the Tunisian family, on the basis of mutual respect\r\nbetween man and wife, of shared responsibility, and of\r\nguaranteed rights of both parties, while taking into account\r\nthe interests and well-being of children.\r\nThis involved the prohibition of polygamy, the raising\r\nof the marriage age to 17 years for girls and to 20 years for\r\nboys, the regulation of divorce, and the adoption of\r\nmeasures that ensure the co-equality of the parents with\r\nrespect to child custody.\r\nThe Personal Statute Code has been amended\r\nalready on five occasions. The major and more significant\r\namendment has been embodied in the measures approved,\r\nin August 1992, by His Excellency the President of the\r\nRepublic with a view to reaffirming Tunisia’s\r\ndetermination to protect the family, ensure its unity, and\r\nguarantee the interests of its members.\r\nThe reforms I speak of, side by side with the\r\nPersonal Statute Code, encompassed the penal, labour and\r\nnationality codes. This empowered Tunisian mothers to\r\nconfer their nationality upon their children from foreign\r\nhusbands, with the agreement of the husband. The\r\nreforms introduced more stringent punishment for\r\nhusband or wife in cases of domestic violence, and\r\ncreated maintenance-allowance funds to guarantee an\r\nincome for divorced women and their offspring. These\r\nand other bold, well-thought-out measures demonstrate\r\nhow Tunisia has approached this issue by invoking both\r\nthe precepts of Islam and the needs of a democratic and\r\nopen civil society.\r\nIn the course of 1994, the International Year of the\r\nFamily, Tunisia has translated these last measures into\r\nconcrete reality, and has set up the structures and\r\nmachinery necessary for their full implementation so that\r\nthey may produce the desired results. Moreover, many\r\ngovernment bodies and voluntary organizations have\r\norganized important events and waged information\r\ncampaigns to familiarize the public with these measures,\r\nto popularize them and to help citizens understand their\r\nrights and duties.\r\nOur progress over the past three decades in the field\r\nof educating the young is one of our most important\r\nachievements, and is a constant of our drive to develop\r\nour human resources which are a must for the\r\nachievement of any progress. Since the first educational\r\nreforms, which were introduced in 1956, with the aim of\r\nmaking schooling available to the children of every\r\nfamily throughout the country, irrespective of means,\r\nTunisia began, in 1991, to set in motion a comprehensive\r\neducational reform programme, aimed especially at\r\nprimary education and compulsory schooling. These\r\nefforts have enabled us to reduce adult illiteracy from\r\n85 per cent to 37 per cent. In 1993, the rate of school\r\nattendance by those between 6 and 16 years of age\r\nreached 82 per cent for girls and 88.7 per cent for boys.\r\nIn 1994, we launched a special programme to reduce\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nilliteracy among women in the rural areas. It is fair to say\r\nthat any State that earmarks some 25 per cent of its budget\r\nfor education and learning will be well placed to cope with\r\nthe challenges of the future.\r\nIn the area of health-care services, our policy\r\nrecognizes the right of every citizen to health coverage, and\r\nour health-care provision is among the best in the world.\r\nMortality rates decreased from 15 per thousand in\r\n1966 to 6.2 per thousand in 1992. The average rate of\r\ninfant mortality decreased from 153 per thousand in 1966\r\nto 32 per thousand in 1992.\r\nSuch results have been achieved thanks to the\r\nexpansion of the network of health-care centres throughout\r\nour cities, villages and rural areas, side by side with\r\nspecific programmes aimed at the eradication of epidemic\r\nand contagious diseases, the promotion of environmental\r\nhealth, control of the purity of drinking water,\r\nreinforcement of school and university medical care,\r\nimmunization programmes and health care and protection\r\nprogrammes for the elderly and the handicapped.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that, in 1994, additional efforts\r\nhave been made to establish health centres in the remote\r\nrural areas and to man them with the necessary staff.\r\nTeams of specialist physicians moved to those areas and\r\nparticipated in the provision of health-care services to\r\nincreasing numbers of our citizens.\r\nThe year 1994 has been characterized also by a\r\nnoticeable reinforcement of the health infrastructure, far-\r\nreaching reform of its institutions and the acquisition of\r\nmodern equipment and instruments to help the health-care\r\nsector in Tunisia developing its know-how in various new\r\nfields and different medical specializations.\r\nAlong with this health-care policy, and proceeding\r\nfrom our awareness that it was necessary to control\r\npopulation growth, in view of the positive returns of such\r\ncontrol, we embarked, as early as 1964, on an ambitious\r\nfamily planning and birth-control programme, implemented\r\nby The Family and Population National Agency. The\r\ncompetence of this Agency covers the whole country\r\nthrough a wide network of stationary and mobile offices\r\nthat provide health and educational services, and carry out\r\nresearch.\r\nThese programmes have been accompanied by the\r\nintroduction of appropriate measures, such as allowing the\r\nprivate sector to import contraceptives in 1961, the\r\nprovision of general social coverage, limiting family\r\nallowances to the first three children and the provision, at\r\nno cost to the recipients, of a wide range of family-\r\nplanning services. These measures have led to a rapid\r\nincrease in the number of people making use of such\r\nservices, so that the use of contraceptives has risen from\r\n31.4 per cent, in 1978, to 50 per cent at present. The\r\naverage birth rate fell from 39 per thousand in 1970 to 25\r\nper thousand in 1992, whereas the composite fecundity\r\nindex fell to 3.2 children, from 7.2 children in 1965.\r\nThe year 1994 has witnessed the implementation of\r\na special action programme for the benefit of rural\r\nfamilies with the aim of improving the integrated family\r\nhealth approach that deals with family planning as one of\r\nthe components of comprehensive health care. Human and\r\nmaterial resources have been increased in areas still\r\nlacking appropriate coverage to promote greater use of\r\ncontraceptives. Priority has been given to on-site\r\neducation and to the provision of medical services\r\nthrough mobile clinics. The programme will continue to\r\nbe implemented over the next few years, till it achieves\r\nits health-care and demographic objectives.\r\nI should also mention here that our family policy has\r\nfocused increasing attention on the needs of women. For\r\nexample, in addition to all I have referred to, Tunisia has\r\nratified many agreements, of which I may mention the\r\nCopenhagen Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\r\nof Discrimination Against Women. The year 1994 has\r\nwitnessed the implementation of the latter measures in the\r\ninterest of women. For example, working mothers covered\r\nby social security receive additional bonuses to enable\r\nthem to make use of nurseries for the care of their\r\nchildren. Agreements have been reached also with various\r\nnational societies to assist such societies in providing new\r\nnurseries and improving services therein.\r\nAs far as the child is concerned, Tunisia has made\r\navailable all legal and institutional guarantees and has\r\nratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. His\r\nExcellency the President of the Republic, last August,\r\nadopted a decision concerning the re-examination of\r\ndivorce conciliation sessions in cases where there are\r\nchildren in the family. Tunisian law provides protection\r\nfor children exposed to various forms of exploitation in\r\norder to shield them from threats and dangers of all kinds.\r\nThis is done mainly through the strengthening of\r\npunishments for those who maltreat, exploit or brutalize\r\na child.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nProceeding from Tunisia’s firm belief that there is no\r\ndignity for any family which does not earn an appropriate\r\nincome that would enable it to function properly and protect\r\nit from want, we have focused, since independence, on\r\nincreasing family incomes through job creation schemes of\r\nvarious kinds. For more than three decades now, we have\r\nbeen earmarking no less than 18 per cent of our gross\r\nnational product for social outlays.\r\nIn that way, the State has been able to provide every\r\nfamily with a supplementary income that is equal to the\r\nminimum guaranteed wage. This is provided through the\r\ncompensation fund and the free health care fund, as well as\r\nby transport fare subsidies, free education and assistance in\r\nkind. Thanks to this policy, we have achieved a great deal,\r\nespecially at the level of better family incomes, which have\r\nbeen multiplied by 4.3 times over a period of 15 years.\r\nThis has enabled families to raise their standards of living\r\nand poverty, which afflicted 33 per cent of our population\r\nin 1967, was reduced to 6.7 per cent in 1990.\r\nOn the initiative of His Excellency President Zine El-\r\nAbidine Ben Ali, a national solidarity fund was created in\r\n1993 to provide for those underprivileged areas and groups\r\nthat are in need of the basic infrastructure of social\r\nservices. In 1993 and 1994 alone, some 300,000 citizens\r\nhave benefited from the fund, through programmes aimed\r\nat improving living conditions by providing that basic\r\ninfrastructure, electricity, drinking water, schools and health\r\ncentres as well as income-creating opportunities that suit the\r\nconditions of each area.\r\nProceeding from Tunisia’s awareness that the\r\navailability of housing is a factor of family stability and\r\nprosperity and an essential requirement of the family is to\r\nfocus on performing its functions, we have pursued an\r\nambitious housing policy that embraced the enactment of\r\nlegislation and the adoption of practical measures, such as\r\nthe setting up of institutions, with the aim of promoting the\r\nhousing sector. Special financing mechanisms have been set\r\nup for the benefit of low-income families. This policy and\r\nthe legislative measures accompanying it have led to a\r\nreduction in the rate of unsuitable housing from 44 per cent\r\nin 1964 to 4.8 per cent in 1980. Today, we can proudly\r\nstate that 80 per cent of Tunisian families own their own\r\nhomes.\r\nSocial security is the best cover that protects the\r\nTunisian family and forms a good social safety net. The\r\nnumber of people covered by social security increased\r\nsevenfold from 1964 to 1991. In 1991, the rate of coverage\r\nstood at 62 per cent of the working population. Special\r\nattention has been paid also to Tunisian nationals living\r\nabroad. This attention has been heightened over the past\r\nfew years and has led to the creation of a government\r\nagency and a supreme council for Tunisians abroad. The\r\naim is to protect the rights of those Tunisian nationals\r\nespecially after the enactment of the new laws of the\r\nunited Europe.\r\nDuring the World Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, held recently in Cairo, Tunisia called for\r\nthe convening of a world symposium that would bring\r\ntogether the countries concerned with the issue of\r\nimmigration to discuss the issues and problems relating to\r\nthat issue and to find suitable solutions to the difficulties\r\nwhich are now surfacing.\r\nAs the family is the fundamental nucleus of any\r\nsociety and its backbone; as it is the yardstick whereby\r\nwe can gauge any society’s adherence to the norms of\r\ncivilized living; and as it represents one of the most\r\nimportant values and is one of the most solid institutions,\r\nwe in Tunisia have accorded it a high priority. Despite the\r\nprofound changes we are going through, we have\r\ncontinued to attach the highest importance to protecting\r\nthe family. To this end, we have established a new\r\nMinistry and a Supreme Council for Women and the\r\nFamily. Furthermore, the President of the Republic\r\ndeclared 11 December National Family Day, 11 January\r\nNational Children’s Day and 13 August National\r\nWomen’s Day. On those days, we intensify our family-\r\noriented information campaigns with the aim of increasing\r\npublic awareness of the rights and obligations of the\r\nfamily and of women and children.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nAt the national level, our family policy is in\r\nharmony with general international trends. We have been\r\nfocusing on the link between human rights in general and\r\nthe rights of special sections of the population, such as\r\nwomen and children. Tunisia is committed to its\r\ninternational agreements relating to the family and the\r\nprotection of its members. It has ratified, implemented\r\nand entrenched international treaties and conventions\r\nadopted in that area. This has been made evident by our\r\nparticipation in international and regional meetings and\r\nconferences, where we discussed a whole range of\r\nproblems relating to the family. In addition, we have\r\nparticipated in all the activities of the International Year\r\nof the Family, where we expressed our views and shared\r\nour experiences.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nWe also hosted the United Nations Africa and Western\r\nAsia Preparatory Meeting for the International Year of the\r\nFamily, held from 29 March to 2 April 1993. Many of the\r\nconclusions and recommendations adopted at that meeting\r\nfocused on: First: supporting and protecting the family in\r\norder to enable it to perform its social, economic and\r\ncultural functions; Second: creating national family\r\ncommissions and encouraging non-governmental\r\norganizations to participate in that effort. Tunisia has put\r\nthis recommendation into effect by setting up the Supreme\r\nCouncil for Women and the Family; Third: declaring\r\n15 May an International Day of the Family. Tunisia has\r\ncelebrated that day in the current year by organizing a\r\nnumber of events; Fourth: the convening of an international\r\nsymposium to evaluate the achievements of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. This meeting is part of\r\nsuch effort; Fifth: promoting cooperation and the exchange\r\nof information between nations; and, Sixth: the creation of\r\nan international family centre to monitor the implementation\r\nof the various recommendations adopted and evaluate the\r\npolicies enacted in this area.\r\nIn Tunisia, numerous events and activities have taken\r\nplace in celebration of the International Year of the Family,\r\nfrom 19 June 1994, the starting date of the celebration, as\r\ndeclared by President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, through the\r\nend of September 1994.\r\nWe have been actively preparing to participate in the\r\nWorld Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing in June\r\n1995, after having participated very meaningfully in the\r\nCairo Population Conference.\r\nHis Excellency President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali of\r\nTunisia is this year’s President of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU). From the first day of his presidency,\r\nhe has highlighted — as he did in his speech before the\r\nAfrican Heads of State at the African summit held in\r\nTunisia in June 1994 — the importance of human\r\nresources, the lot of children and the suffering of many\r\nfamilies as a result of various natural disasters and other\r\ndifficulties affecting some African societies. On this subject\r\nhe said,\r\n“It is evident that we need to develop our human\r\nresources and safeguard the rights of our children in\r\nthe fields of education, learning and health. Some of\r\nour countries have achieved things that deserve to be\r\nconsolidated and followed up, because in certain parts\r\nof our continent our children -victims of war, famine,\r\ndisease and expulsion — are still suffering. Therefore,\r\nwe have to mobilize all efforts to rescue those\r\ninnocent children, because they are the very\r\nfoundation of any real or lasting development. This\r\nis an international obligation that we must fulfil in\r\nconsonance with our countries’ ratification of the\r\nInternational Declaration on the Rights of the Child\r\nand the Plan of Action relating to the welfare of the\r\nchild.”\r\nTunisian non-governmental organizations have taken\r\nmany decisions and initiatives for the benefit of children\r\nand families in Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina to\r\nhelp them surmount the difficulties they are now facing\r\nand to provide them with some of their basic needs.\r\nThe strategy of Tunisia’s policy strikes a balance\r\nbetween, on the one hand, the provision of the required\r\nfinancial means and, on the other, the present and future\r\ndifficulties which do affect any innovative action. In our\r\nstrategy we try to analyse all kinds of Tunisian policies in\r\norder to meet their needs. However, obstacles presented\r\nby the new economic world order and the new directions\r\ntaken by a number of international organizations\r\nconcerned with investment in health and social projects,\r\nas well as the heavy burden of servicing foreign debts,\r\nmake it very difficult for developing countries, including\r\nmiddle-income developing countries such as Tunisia, to\r\nmuster the required financial means to invest in social\r\nprogrammes and projects.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, I cannot but remind of the\r\nappeal President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali made from this\r\nvery rostrum when he called upon the international\r\ncommunity to reschedule the debts of third world\r\ncountries so that funds could be invested in the future of\r\nthe family and in various social programmes. Sustainable\r\ndevelopment can be achieved only through greater\r\nsolidarity between nations and through a new collective\r\neffort, taking into account the interests of all.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.05 p.m.\r\n14\r\n"
