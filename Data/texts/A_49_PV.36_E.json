(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 95 (continued)\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family\r\nInternational Conference on Families\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I should\r\nlike to inform the Assembly that in a letter dated 18\r\nOctober 1994 the Permanent Representative of Canada, on\r\nbehalf of the Western European and Other States, has\r\nrequested that the Assembly hear in plenary meeting a\r\nstatement by the observer of the Holy See during the\r\nInternational Conference on Families.\r\nMembers will recall that, in accordance with\r\nestablished practice of the General Assembly, observer non-\r\nMember States may normally make statements only in the\r\nMain Committees. However, following consultations and\r\ntaking into account the importance attached to the issues\r\nunder discussion, it is proposed that the General Assembly\r\nshould take a decision to hear the observer of the Holy See\r\nin the course of the International Conference on Families.\r\nI take it that there is no objection to this proposal.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nfirst on Mr. Michael Woods, Minister for Social Welfare\r\nof Ireland.\r\nMr. Woods (Ireland): I have the honour to address\r\nthe General Assembly on behalf of the Government of\r\nIreland.\r\nI would like to congratulate the United Nations on\r\nthe outstanding success of the International Year of the\r\nFamily all over the world. The Organization’s initiative\r\nin devoting these plenary meetings to an International\r\nConference on Families is particularly welcome.\r\nIreland has always been very committed to the\r\nUnited Nations, of which we have been a member since\r\n1955. Next year marks the fiftieth anniversary of this\r\nOrganization. Over the years we have made our own\r\ncontribution, particularly in the area of peace-keeping\r\noperations. We have participated in and signed many\r\nConventions, which have helped us to shape our own\r\npolicies. We have expanded our overseas aid\r\nprogrammes to give greater economic and technical\r\nsupport to developing countries, particularly in Africa.\r\nYet, for all the progress that has been made world-\r\nwide, there is still a great distance to be travelled to a\r\nworld of justice, equality and respect for the individual.\r\nPeople of all nations still look to the United Nations to\r\nhelp them travel that distance and to meet the challenges\r\nthat arise on the way.\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nI know that all who are present here today will\r\nwarmly welcome the success to date of the process towards\r\nachieving a lasting peace in the whole island of Ireland.\r\nThe announcements last August and just last week of a\r\ncessation of violence present us with a great opportunity to\r\nbreak free from the stagnation and demoralization caused\r\nby the prolonged violence over the past 25 years in\r\nNorthern Ireland.\r\nLike South Africa, the Middle East and Eastern\r\nEurope, we are coming to grips with resolving our own\r\napparently insoluble problems. In doing so, we can provide\r\na tremendous boost to our national confidence and to our\r\ninternational standing.\r\nThis historic breakthrough is particularly timely in this\r\nInternational Year of the Family. Families have been the\r\nvictims of the heartbreak of the past 25 years of violence\r\nin Northern Ireland. I know that all members share our\r\nearnest hope that the suffering endured by them has now\r\nfinally been brought to an end. Families will be the chief\r\nbeneficiaries of the peace dividend that flows from this\r\npeace process.\r\nThis International Year of the Family, now coming to\r\na close, has given us an opportunity to highlight the\r\nimportance of the family as the natural and basic unit of\r\nsociety. That concept of the family was the clear message\r\nthat came out of a meeting of Ministers Responsible for\r\nFamily Affairs in the European Union, which I attended last\r\nmonth in Berlin.\r\nUnemployment is the single greatest challenge facing\r\nfamilies today. Across Europe some 20 million people are\r\nunemployed. Because of our peripheral and demographic\r\nsituation, our unemployment problem in Ireland is higher\r\nthan the European average. Some 18 percent of our work\r\nforce is out of work.\r\nIt is a daunting task for any Government to create the\r\nright economic climate for employment, one that will meet\r\nnot only the needs of those currently unemployed but also\r\nthe hopes and aspirations of a young, emerging work force.\r\nThis is the challenge facing my Government.\r\nThe challenges to family life and the supports needed\r\nare issues that must be urgently considered by a developing\r\nEurope. The designation by the United Nations of this year\r\nas International Year of the Family provides us with the\r\nopportunity to address these issues and chart a course for\r\nthe next millennium. The policies that lead us into the next\r\ncentury must provide supports and progressive options for\r\nparents and children, without distinction. We owe it to\r\nour children to do it well.\r\nThe tradition of the family has always been one of\r\nour strongest national characteristics in Ireland. It is a\r\ntradition which has focused on support for parents and\r\ntheir children. It is a tradition endorsed by our own\r\nConstitution, which recognizes the family as \"the natural\r\nprimary and fundamental unit group of society.\"\r\nYet we have never been exclusive in the way we\r\ndescribe the family. Irish society has always recognized\r\nthe wide-ranging nature of the family unit. This is\r\nnowhere more apparent than in the intergenerational\r\nrelationships within the family. Generations of Irish\r\nchildren have grown up in extended families, with\r\ngrandparents and elderly relatives living in a caring\r\nenvironment. While families are smaller today, that\r\ncaring tradition continues, with families increasingly\r\ntaking an active part in the development of their\r\ncommunities.\r\nLike other European countries, Ireland’s strong\r\nfamily tradition is coming under increasing economic and\r\nsocial pressure as we adjust to a fast-moving, more open\r\nand rapidly developing European society. Ireland, with a\r\nbirth-rate of 14.6 per 1000 population, is still among the\r\nhighest in Europe and one of the few nations with a\r\nsmall, natural increase in population. Almost 50 per cent\r\nof the population in Ireland is under the age of 25. Yet\r\nthe declining trend in population which has been evident\r\nin Europe for some time is also developing in Ireland.\r\nAlmost one fifth of our population is aged 55 or over.\r\nThere is a clear need for a new realistic policy and\r\nfor strategies to strengthen and support the family. In our\r\nview, the family is the bedrock of our society, the place\r\nwhere our children find a stable, secure and supportive\r\nenvironment from which to grow and in turn provide a\r\nstable and peaceful society.\r\nBut families face other challenges, challenges posed\r\nby the changes in society itself. The traditional family of\r\nbreadwinner, spouse and children, while still the most\r\ncommon, is no longer the only family unit. Families are\r\ngetting smaller - that is evident to us all. The number of\r\nlone-parent families is increasing. But there are other\r\nchanges taking place which require us to widen our\r\nperspective on the nature of families. Ageing\r\npopulations, and an increasing tendency to care for older\r\npeople in the community, more particularly in their own\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nhomes, have gained recognition for families composed of\r\npensioner and carer.\r\nThese changes require a much more flexible approach\r\nin the range of supports provided for families in those\r\ncircumstances. They must encompass not only income\r\nmaintenance in the event of critical contingencies, such as\r\nillness or unemployment, but also tailor-made assistance to\r\naddress the situation of the family at a particular time in its\r\nlife cycle. In Ireland, out of a population of 3.6 million,\r\nabout 800,000 people and their 700,000 dependents rely on\r\nsocial-welfare payments. Families receive additional\r\npayments for children, normally up to 18 years of age.\r\nSome 250,000 families benefit in this way.\r\nChild income support is a key feature of the\r\nGovernment’s commitment to families, with half a million\r\nfamilies benefiting from our scheme of Child Benefit.\r\nChild Benefit is a universal payment which goes to almost\r\n1 million children, irrespective of the income of the\r\nhousehold. Our objective for the future is to develop Child\r\nBenefit as the main element of child income support,\r\nespecially as it is payable to families regardless of their\r\nwork status. I have recently announced the setting up of a\r\nSpecial Committee to advise me on the future development\r\nof our child income supports in the lead-up to our annual\r\nbudget next January.\r\nWe also have support payments for workers bringing\r\nup families on low pay, as well as child-related tax-\r\nexemption allowances. Back-to-school allowances cover all\r\nchildren in families dependent on social welfare or at work\r\non low pay. One in three school-going children benefit\r\nfrom these allowances. Older people and retired people\r\nwith dependents receive additional support by way of free\r\ntravel, special living-alone allowances and assistance with\r\nelectricity, heating bills and television licenses.\r\nBeginning later this month, we will have our\r\nSurvivor’s Pension extended to widowers on the same\r\nterms and conditions as to widows. In this case, both men\r\nand women will benefit in the same way from the\r\nSurvivor’s Pension.\r\nThe Irish Government is committed to a broad range\r\nof institutional, administrative and legislative reforms over\r\nthe next few years, aimed at strengthening support for the\r\nfamily and, in particular, for women and children.\r\nImmediate initiatives include a major programme of family\r\nlaw reform and a referendum on divorce next year. I must\r\nmention here that, apart from the right to remarry, we\r\nalready have divorce on the statute books in Ireland to all\r\nintents and purposes in the form of the Judicial Separation\r\nand Family Law Reform Act, 1989.\r\nCivil legal aid and advice provision and the family\r\nmediation service are also being strengthened. It is also\r\nplanned to expand child-care facilities and to provide for\r\nadoptive leave for adopting parents. Protection for\r\nmothers at work is being strengthened and developed.\r\nStudies in Ireland have shown a strong correlation\r\nbetween long-term unemployment and low educational\r\nattainment. The objective of our educational schemes for\r\nthe unemployed is to provide a second chance for those\r\nwho, for one reason or another, never completed their\r\nformal education. The work we are doing in that area is\r\nproving to be particularly successful in helping those\r\npeople get back into the work force.\r\nThe voluntary sector can make an inestimable\r\ncontribution to the social and economic life of a country.\r\nIt has a key role in developing the community, in\r\nfostering self-help and in empowering people to shape\r\ntheir own futures.\r\nIn my own country, we are fortunate to enjoy an\r\nactive and vibrant voluntary sector. In fact, over half the\r\nadults in Ireland are involved with a voluntary\r\norganization of one kind or another - that is, one in every\r\ntwo persons is involved in a voluntary organization of one\r\nkind or another.\r\nIt was for this reason that back in 1990 I initiated\r\nthe Community Development Programme under the\r\nauspices of my Department. Funding is provided on a\r\nthree-year basis to enable resource centres to get off the\r\nground. Other programmes supporting the voluntary\r\nsector include once-off grants for capital projects\r\nundertaken by organizations to enhance their capacity and\r\na scheme of grants for locally based women’s groups, to\r\nbe followed this year by a scheme of grants for men’s\r\ngroups. The women were doing most of the work in the\r\ncommunity, and I knew that. We had difficulty getting\r\nthe men involved, but once the women were up and\r\ngetting these grants, the men very soon came forward and\r\nwanted the scheme for themselves. It was the women\r\nwho really brought them forward in the first instance, but\r\nit has certainly revitalized the community involvement in\r\nsolving problems in their own communities, and\r\nparticularly the problems of the disadvantaged.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nAll of these initiatives have been extremely successful\r\nin empowering local communities to address the problems\r\nthey encounter.\r\nSupport for the family has been a striking aspect of\r\ncommunity development in Ireland. In line with the\r\nparameters set by the United Nations in relation to the\r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations, we have\r\nactively supported the development of family resource\r\ncentres. These centres figure prominently in projects\r\nlooking for funding, equipment, training in parenting skills\r\nand other forms of support. They have developed the\r\nconfidence of local people. Our experience has been that\r\nthey can be a catalyst for local development, for enterprise\r\nand for jobs. I am convinced that this type of community\r\ndevelopment is the way forward. It can strengthen the\r\nfamily and provide a focal point for its development within\r\nsociety.\r\nIn relation to jobs, the local community will identify\r\nmany opportunities in the \"micro\" field. We hear about job\r\ncreation and about small industries, but when one comes\r\ndown to the reality on the ground for many local\r\ncommunities one is really talking about micro-industries\r\nand micro-businesses. It is micro-businesses in particular\r\nthat will be fostered by people working in their own\r\ncommunities.\r\nFor the future, then, we must preserve, promote,\r\nsupport and develop the strong family tradition that is to be\r\nfound in Ireland. The Irish Government is committed to\r\nthose ideals. Families must be central to future policy\r\ndevelopment in the United Nations and in other major\r\nworld agencies that chart the course of world economic and\r\nsocial progress. The completion of the International Year\r\nof the Family is only the start of a process, which should\r\nlead to a framework within which families will be\r\ncherished, and their central contribution to the well-being\r\nof society acknowledged and supported. Secondly, family-\r\ncentred policies will ensure that the new world prosperity\r\ndoes not pass them by.\r\nIn particular, we need new, inclusive arrangements so\r\nthat families can benefit fully from the world-wide drive for\r\njobs. The United Nations must instil new urgency in the\r\ndevelopment of family-friendly policies. Those who are\r\nconcerned with economic and general social development\r\nare very deeply involved in these tasks, but we must not\r\nallow them to forget that the basic and fundamental unit of\r\nour society is the members of the family who will suffer\r\nmost if we do not provide them with opportunities,\r\ninvolvement and jobs.\r\nThe United Nations, its specialized agencies and\r\nnational Governments must implement measures to\r\npromote economic development so as to ensure that\r\nfamilies benefit from the new prosperity. We also need\r\nproper support for families with disabled members as\r\nthose members strive to live and work independently in\r\nour society.\r\nFamily policy is not just about population control, as\r\nwe have heard from the recent Cairo Conference; it\r\nembraces issues relevant to all family types. If we in the\r\nUnited Nations are concerned about people and their\r\nneeds - and I know that we are - we must take account of\r\nthe many different kinds of family members, including\r\nmothers, whether at home or at work, elderly people,\r\npeople with disabilities, carers and those in need of\r\nfull-time care. We must come forward with policies that\r\nare truly family-friendly.\r\nI should like to conclude by sharing with the\r\nAssembly a quotation that I came across recently, which\r\ncaptures the essence of what we are trying to achieve at\r\ninternational level. I believe very strongly that it is time\r\nwe took a very determined position internationally in\r\nrelation to people with disabilities by giving them the full\r\ninvolvement in society that they so richly deserve. We\r\nhave the technologies and the knowledge. We must also\r\nhave the will to ensure that these people are included in\r\nthe front line of policies. The quotation to which I have\r\nreferred, which I regard as particularly profound, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\"If you have come to help me, then you can go back\r\nhome. But if you see my struggle as part of your\r\nown survival, then perhaps we can work together.\"\r\nThose words were uttered at a conference of people with\r\ndisabilities. They contain a great lesson for all of us.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Gudmundur Arni Stefánsson, Minister of\r\nSocial Affairs of Iceland, who will speak on behalf of the\r\nNordic countries.\r\nMr. Stefánsson (Iceland): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the five Nordic countries - Denmark,\r\nFinland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland - on agenda item\r\n95 relating to the International Conference on Families.\r\nRecognition and acceptance of the variety in family\r\nstructures in different socio-political and cultural systems\r\nis one of the main goals of the United Nations\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nInternational Year of the Family. In the Nordic countries,\r\nthe Year of the Family has inspired considerable debate on\r\nthe condition of families in modern societies. In those\r\ncountries the family is perceived as a resource that is\r\nimportant both to individuals and to society. It is the basic\r\nunit for social integration and social reproduction.\r\nConsequently, much attention has been devoted to assessing\r\nthe impact of social and economic developments in our\r\nsocieties on family life and on the measures to be taken to\r\nprevent the social exclusion of vulnerable families and their\r\nindividual members.\r\nFor several decades our Governments have pursued\r\nfamily welfare policies. These policies, which are well\r\nintegrated into our general welfare systems, emphasize the\r\nprotection of children and gender equality.\r\nIn times of economic recession it is particularly\r\nimportant, if we are to prevent social exclusion, to pay\r\nattention to the vulnerability of children and parents who\r\nlack support from local social networks. Society must be\r\nable to support families in distress. Tragic instances have\r\ndemonstrated that an efficiently functioning network of\r\nsocial services is necessary. By such means we have been\r\nable to arrange crisis and assistance groups for possible\r\nvictims and the members of their families.\r\nAn important feature of family policy in our countries\r\nhas been concern about the social conditions of\r\nmotherhood. Our earliest reforms were to a large extent\r\nbased on measures intended for mothers - in particular,\r\nsingle mothers.\r\nMore recently, changing lifestyles and developments\r\nin the labour market have led to a number of reforms. The\r\ndaily experiences of women and their efforts to reconcile\r\nfamily and work constitute a strong argument for the\r\nintroduction of special incentives to share parental\r\nresponsibilities, both in the labour market and in the family.\r\nWhile paying attention to the relevant experiences of\r\nwomen, we have become increasingly aware of the needs\r\nof children. The everyday experiences of children have\r\nprompted efforts to enhance measures for preventing their\r\nearly social exclusion.\r\nFurthermore, focusing on the everyday experience of\r\nchildren has, in turn, led to an increased awareness of the\r\nrole of the father. Attention is now paid in our countries to\r\nthe importance of involving fathers in sharing family\r\nfunctions. This will be one of the major contributions of\r\nthe International Year of the Family in our countries.\r\nThe International Year of the Family has provided us\r\nwith insight into and understanding of the mechanisms in\r\nthe complex interplay between societal processes and\r\nfamily dynamics. Our most urgent concerns are to take\r\nmeasures to support parents in reconciling work and\r\nfamily life in a fruitful way and to provide supplementary\r\nservices and networks for social and educational support,\r\nboth for parents and children, in local settings.\r\nThis is not the occasion to go into details about\r\nthese measures. However I would like to underline some\r\nof the basic principles on which they are based. Public\r\nconcern with family issues is based on the individual\r\nrights of all family members, relying mainly on general\r\nmeasures; highly committed to gender equality and the\r\nrights of the child; connected to related labour market\r\npolicies; strongly committed to the pursuit of social\r\nintegration for all members of society.\r\nA central feature in Nordic societies, reflecting a\r\nmove towards equal status for women, is the high rate of\r\nwomen in gainful employment. A tight daily schedule is\r\na reality for many families with children. Reconciliation\r\nof work and family life is necessary. This benefits the\r\nworking family members, the employers and the whole\r\nfamily and thus society in general. Making the working\r\nhours of parents of small or disabled children shorter and\r\nmore flexible is one solution promoted by the Nordic\r\ncountries. However, other alternative work arrangements\r\nshould be available to parents. Using these alternatives\r\nshould not lead to exclusion from the labour market. In\r\nreconciling family life and work life it is important that\r\nsociety offer support in the form of sufficient day-care\r\nservices.\r\nEquality between family members and full\r\nenjoyment of human rights is a basic principle in the\r\nNordic countries. This applies not least to children. In\r\nthis connection, I would like to stress the importance of\r\nthe ratification and implementation of the Convention of\r\nthe Rights of the Child and the Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen.\r\nAlthough problems that concern children cannot be\r\nsolved simply through legislation, legislation does provide\r\nthe basis for improving the status of the child. The\r\nparticipation of children in decisions regarding their daily\r\nlives is being developed in our countries. The rights of\r\nthe child are not the exclusive domain of the family. A\r\nchild has independent civil and social rights. The laws in\r\nour countries include, among other things, provisions\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nregarding the responsibility of parents in caring for their\r\nchildren. The law also guarantees the physical safety of\r\nchildren. In this way, parental authority is exercised within\r\nthe confines of the law.\r\nDomestic violence remains widespread. The\r\nprotection of family members against domestic violence,\r\nparticularly women and children, must be guaranteed by\r\nlaw. Yet legislation cannot stand on its own. It is\r\ntherefore necessary to discuss domestic violence openly in\r\norder to influence general attitudes.\r\nFar-reaching economic and social change calls for\r\nrevitalized and innovative family policies. Through\r\ninternational cooperation we can learn from each other and\r\nadopt models that are suitable to our respective countries.\r\nThe United Nations is an invaluable forum for this learning\r\nprocess.\r\nThe United Nations also plays a central role in\r\nsupporting programmes related to families. Particularly in\r\ncountries which cannot afford a comprehensive social\r\nsafety-net, the role of the family still remains crucial.\r\nThese countries must be supported in their efforts to\r\nprovide for the care of elderly people and dependent family\r\nmembers by means that respect individual rights of freedom\r\nand integrity.\r\nThe International Year of the Family is part of a\r\nglobal effort to promote social and economic development\r\nin the world. The International Conference on Population\r\nand Development in Cairo made headway in many sectors\r\ncritical to the family. The World Summit on Social\r\nDevelopment in Copenhagen and the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women in Beijing next year will give us an\r\nopportunity to address a wide range of issues which are\r\nclosely related to the well-being of the family.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on Her Excellency Senator Rosemary Crowley,\r\nMinister for Family Services of Australia.\r\nSenator Crowley (Australia): It gives me very great\r\npleasure to speak about Australia’s contribution to the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. We applaud the initiative\r\nof the United Nations in proclaiming 1994 the International\r\nYear of the Family.\r\nAustralia has embraced the International Year and\r\nseized the opportunity to celebrate, reflect upon and support\r\nfamily life in our country.\r\nThe United Nations wanted Governments and\r\nnon-governmental organizations to recognize that their\r\ndecisions and actions influence how families grow and\r\nhow well they function as nurturers and providers.\r\nWhat the Australian Government aimed for, and\r\nwhat I believe it largely achieved, is a new level of\r\ncommitment to Government policies and programs which\r\nare truly family-friendly.\r\nWe have celebrated the Year in cooperation with the\r\nvarious spheres of Government in Australia - national,\r\nstate and local - and with business and the community.\r\nWe have recognized that families are as important\r\ntoday as they have ever been. For the most part, they are\r\nthriving and making an enormous contribution to society.\r\nWe have also recognized that there is not just one model\r\nof what a successful family looks like.\r\nAustralian families are rich in their diversity. The\r\ncountry was home to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait\r\nIslander peoples thousands of years before white\r\nsettlement. Within the cultures of these peoples, the\r\nfamily, particularly the extended family, plays a\r\nsignificant role.\r\nToday’s Australian population of 17,000,000\r\nincludes people from over 130 ethnic backgrounds and\r\nover 220 nationalities. Nearly a quarter of our population\r\nwas born overseas or has a parent who was born\r\noverseas.\r\nEach new wave of settlers has brought different\r\nforms of family life, and these differences are recognized\r\nin our policies of multiculturalism and support for the\r\ndiversity of the family.\r\nCelebration of the family has an important positive\r\ndimension. It helps to remind all of us - including\r\nGovernments, employers, unions, and community\r\norganizations - of the central place in our culture of the\r\nfamily and the need to ensure that our policies and\r\npractices nurture, develop and protect the family.\r\nBut celebration is not enough.\r\nA large part of this year has been spent listening\r\nclosely to what our community has to say about families\r\n- about the challenges they are facing, and the ways\r\nGovernments can best assist them.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nThe Government established a National Council for\r\nthe International Year of the Family and it was asked to\r\nconsult as widely as possible with Australians and report\r\nback to the Government on its findings. The Council\r\nproduced a document called \"The Heart of the Matter\",\r\nwhich is a window on Australian families in 1994. It\r\nserved as the basis for community consultation.\r\nThe Australian community has responded\r\nenthusiastically. There were 70 days of consultation\r\ncovering all parts of Australia, from the dusty outback to\r\nour urban centres, and the Council received over 500\r\nsubmissions. The Council’s final report will be presented\r\nto the Government by the end of this month. The\r\nAustralian Government’s response to that report and to the\r\nYear will be the Australian Government Agenda for\r\nFamilies, a coherent and comprehensive statement of policy\r\nand programmes for families into the future. It will address\r\nall aspects of national Government activity that relate to\r\nfamilies and the impact of all Government policies on\r\nfamilies. It will be a blueprint for Australian families well\r\nbeyond 1994.\r\nOver the past decade, the Australian Government has\r\nimplemented a broad range of policies to benefit Australian\r\nfamilies. The Government has recognized that family\r\npolicies are not just welfare policies. They are not just\r\nabout helping families at the margin.\r\nA nation’s fundamental economic policies and\r\ninfrastructure also have a crucial impact on the well-being\r\nof families. At that broad level, the Australian Government\r\nhas achieved much in the past decade to provide families\r\nwith opportunities to participate equally in the life of the\r\ncountry. The Government has recognized the importance\r\nof policies that assist women to participate fully in society.\r\nWe have implemented a number of programmes to assist\r\nwomen and enacted legislation to outlaw discrimination.\r\nThe Government recognizes that most women in their\r\nadult lives will spend some time at home, particularly when\r\ntheir children are young, and some time in the paid work\r\nforce. In this International Year of the Family, we have\r\nintroduced new payments that support the choice of women\r\nand their families.\r\nIf families are to function they need to be free of the\r\nstress of poverty, have adequate living conditions,\r\nespecially housing, be able to rely on a stable system of\r\nlaws and legislation that respect family autonomy while\r\nprotecting vulnerable members; and have access to\r\nsupportive services to help them handle the challenges of\r\nlife.\r\nFamily income support - especially for those on low\r\nincomes who are caring for children - has been a major\r\nfocus of the Australian Government since it was elected\r\nin 1983.\r\nThe Government has introduced targeted payments\r\nto help those on very low incomes, whether or not they\r\nare in the work force, via the Family Allowance\r\nSupplement. Payments have also been integrated to make\r\nthe system simpler. We have attempted to give the\r\nsupport directly to the carer - usually the mother - and to\r\nmaximize incentives for work force participation. In its\r\nlast national budget, the Government also moved to\r\nintroduce a new parenting allowance which recognizes the\r\nimportance of this role and extends the choices available\r\nto families. The Government has also increased the rate\r\nof child payments to low-income families by 78 per cent\r\nin real terms.\r\nThe Government is currently conducting a major\r\nreview of all family income payments to assess how they\r\nmight be improved and made more accessible.\r\nFamily law governing family formation and\r\ndissolution is also being systematically reviewed. The\r\nAustralian Government is introducing major changes to\r\nour family laws this year. The changes will ease the\r\npainful process of dissolution of marriage and raise the\r\nstatus of children. Children will no longer be viewed as\r\nobjects for custody but, rather, as people who deserve\r\nresponsible parenting. The new focus on parental\r\nresponsibilities will, we hope, minimize the damaging\r\ntrauma when a family breaks down.\r\nThese steps complement the recent establishment of\r\nthe Child Support Agency. This has put in place statutory\r\nchild support arrangements which make it illegal for\r\nnon-custodial parents to shirk their responsibilities to\r\nprovide financially for their children. Each month the\r\nChild Support Agency passes on income support to\r\n300,000 children.\r\nRegrettably the family is not always a safe and\r\nsecure haven. The Government has a range of strategies\r\nto respond to family violence. These include: a national\r\nsystem of supported accommodation for women and\r\nfamilies; a national clearing-house for research on\r\nviolence against women and children; a national\r\ncommunity domestic violence education programme to\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nstop violence against women; and a national strategy to\r\nprevent child abuse and neglect.\r\nThe Australian Government also supports a\r\ncomprehensive range of family and parental counselling\r\nprogrammes. During the International Year of the Family\r\nthe Government moved to further improve the pre-marriage\r\ncounselling skills of civil celebrants so that the excellent\r\nprogrammes offered by the churches were matched for\r\nthose married by civil ceremony.\r\nThe Government has an explicit objective of ensuring\r\nthat every Australian has access to secure, adequate,\r\nappropriate and affordable housing. A particular priority\r\nhas been to support community housing that maximizes\r\ntenants’ control over their housing. Home ownership is still\r\ndesired by most Australians, and since 1992-1993 over\r\n210,000 low-income and moderate-income families with\r\nchildren have obtained housing loans through Government\r\nschemes.\r\nThe Government is also aware of the stress that poor\r\nhealth can put on families and it has put in place a\r\nuniversal health insurance scheme - Medicare - which\r\nguarantees access to high-quality health care for the whole\r\npopulation. There are also special health programmes\r\ntargeted at the special health needs of indigenous\r\nAustralians.\r\nAustralia has not been spared the consequences of the\r\nrecent world recession. The Government recognizes that\r\nsufficient jobs and a stable economy are crucial to family\r\ncohesion and well-being. To this end, it has extended\r\nsignificantly its employment and training programmes.\r\nThere is a particular focus on the long-term unemployed,\r\naccess for young people and opportunities for women. This\r\nsupplements the education programme for our children,\r\nwhich has seen the proportion who reach the final year of\r\nhigh school increase from under 40 per cent to more than\r\ndouble what it was over the last decade.\r\nIn 1990 Australia ratified International Labour\r\nOrganisation (ILO) Convention 156 to strengthen its\r\ncommitment to bridging the gap between families and\r\nwork. One of the most significant contributions of the\r\nGovernment to family well-being, and to helping families\r\ncombine paid work with parenting responsibilities, is the\r\nexpansion of the child-care programme. Since 1983 the\r\nnumber of child-care places supported by the national\r\nGovernment has increased fivefold. The Government is\r\ncommitted now to meeting all work-related demand for\r\nchild care by the year 2001. The Government also provides\r\nfinancial assistance with fees to keep child care\r\naffordable. And to ensure that parents can be confident\r\nin the quality of care their children are receiving we have\r\ninstituted a national accreditation system.\r\nIn the industrial sphere laws are being reviewed to\r\nhelp give further effect to ILO Convention 156. The\r\nGovernment has already legislated for a 12-month\r\nentitlement to parental leave to be available to all workers\r\nand has also legislated expressly to ensure that\r\ndiscrimination on the grounds of family responsibilities is\r\nunlawful.\r\nThe Government’s response to the needs of our\r\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is also\r\ncentral to our efforts to help create a mature, tolerant and\r\nfair society. Aboriginal peoples and families have\r\nhistorically been among the least advantaged in our\r\ncommunity. That is not a situation which the Australian\r\nGovernment and the vast majority of Australian people\r\nwish to see continue. Through legislation and through\r\nfunded programmes we will continue to help this sector\r\nof our community to help themselves, and through\r\nlegislation and funding we will also assist Aboriginal\r\ncommunities to acquire ownership and control of their\r\ntraditional land in order to help keep communities and\r\nfamilies together.\r\nAustralia’s initiatives for the International Year of\r\nthe Family are an important part of the social justice\r\nagenda we have pursued for over 10 years now. The\r\nAustralian Government Agenda for Families will build on\r\nthese initiatives, extend them and, in particular, place the\r\nfamily at the centre of Government policy.\r\nThe evidence from a wide range of United Nations\r\nbodies, from the Security Council to the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF), highlights the challenges\r\nconfronting the world’s families. Australia will use the\r\nwork of the International Year of the Family to set\r\nbenchmarks against which it can monitor the\r\nimprovements for families into the next century. My\r\nchallenge to the United Nations is that it do the same.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nnext on Mrs. Eveline Hoenigsperger, Director for Family\r\nAffairs, Federal Ministry of Environment, Youth and\r\nFamily of Austria.\r\nMrs. Hoenigsperger (Austria): On behalf of the\r\nFederal Ministry of Environment, Youth and Family of\r\nAustria, which is responsible for the preparation and\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nimplementation of the International Year of the Family at\r\nthe national level, I have the honour to address the General\r\nAssembly and present the results of our efforts on this\r\nsubject.\r\nAustria was among those States which supported\r\nPoland’s initiative of launching an International Year of the\r\nFamily at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly\r\nin 1989. Austria’s support for this initiative is based on the\r\nfact that my country traditionally regards family policy as\r\na priority matter at both the national and the international\r\nlevel.\r\nBy international standards Austria maintains a leading\r\nrole with regard to family allowances and other supportive\r\nmeasures for the family. As a priority issue of Austria’s\r\nsocial policy, family policy has been dealt with in a\r\nseparate \"Ministry of Family Affairs\" since 1984.\r\nHowever, much remains to be done. Our efforts have\r\nto be continued, increased and improved. New initiatives\r\nhave to be launched. Therefore, the United Nations\r\ninitiative to declare an International Year of the Family in\r\n1994 was wholeheartedly welcomed by the Austrian Federal\r\nGovernment as well as by local governments and family\r\norganizations.\r\nThe Federal Government of Austria entrusted a\r\nnational committee with the responsibility of preparing and\r\nimplementing the Year of the Family. The tasks of the\r\nNational Committee were to develop and to coordinate the\r\nactivities of the Federal Government, the nine local\r\ngovernments and family organizations. To achieve\r\nmaximum public awareness and political impact, the\r\nNational Committee was given a high status. At the same\r\ntime, the National Committee was asked to seek the\r\nintegration and participation of non-governmental\r\norganizations and family initiatives at the grass-roots level.\r\nThe National Committee therefore comprises several\r\nlevels: the political level, with representatives of the\r\nFederal Government and local governments, the cities and\r\ncommunities; the interest groups of employers and\r\nemployees; and the operational level, represented by the\r\nliaison officers of the non-governmental organizations.\r\nThe National Committee installed 15 working groups\r\ndealing with 15 priority areas of Austrian family policy.\r\nAround 700 experts, scientists, politicians, civil servants,\r\nmembers of family organizations and trade unions devoted\r\ntheir experience, expertise and a lot of time to the working\r\ngroups. This effort initiated the broadest ever discussion\r\nprocess on family policy in Austria.\r\nApart from the concrete results of the working\r\ngroups, which will have a strong impact on family policy\r\nin Austria at large, the cooperation of individuals of\r\ndifferent political and professional backgrounds and\r\nexperience created a strong integrative effect.\r\nThe debate in the working groups of the National\r\nCommittee emphasized constructive cooperation and\r\nfinding solution instead of pursuing political aims. This\r\nintegrative effect of the machinery for the International\r\nYear of the Family can be seen as a great success, as it\r\nwill have a positive influence on the climate for family\r\npolicy in Austria in the years ahead.\r\nThe 15 working groups, which are the cornerstone\r\nof the implementation of the International Year of the\r\nFamily in Austria, deal with the following facets of the\r\nphenomenon that we know as the family: family\r\nviolence, environment, housing, working life, youth, the\r\nelderly, family allowances, disability, different forms of\r\nliving together, difficult living conditions, family law,\r\nhealth, relationship to society, media and education.\r\nIt is already evident at this stage that the working\r\ngroups were able to reveal \"blank spots\" in Austria’s\r\nfamily policy. New concepts and measures, to be put into\r\npractice at the political level, will be presented later this\r\nyear. The results and recommendations of the working\r\ngroups will make an important contribution to Austria’s\r\nfamily policy in the future.\r\nIn addition to the conceptual work, the working\r\ngroups organized, in cooperation with the Federal\r\nMinistry of Family Affairs, a series of conferences and\r\nworkshops on specific topics, the results of which not\r\nonly enriched the work of the working groups, but also\r\nenhanced public awareness.\r\nFurthermore, based on a recommendation by the\r\nworking groups of the National Committee, the Federal\r\nMinistry of Family Affairs, together with the Federal\r\nMinistry of Science and Research launched a\r\ncomprehensive family research programme.\r\nIn order to involve the local level, the Federal\r\nMinistry of Family Affairs initiated a competition for\r\nprojects and ideas which contribute to higher quality of\r\nlife of the family or to the improvement of the family’s\r\nproblem-solving capacity.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nFamily organizations organized major events all over\r\nAustria, with more than 50,000 families participating. On\r\nthe International Day of the Family, on 15 May, some 300\r\nfamily-related events took place in cities and smaller\r\nvillages. In order to raise public awareness of these events,\r\nthe Federal Minister for Family Affairs launched an award\r\nfor journalists focusing on family issues in their work.\r\nAustrian schools were provided with information on\r\nthe International Year of the Family. Students aged 14 to\r\n18 received a brochure to motivate them to reflect on their\r\nfamilies and their role within the family. This initiative can\r\nbe regarded as a first step towards a family education at\r\nschool.\r\nAltogether, more than 600 official events were carried\r\nout by members of the National Committee, and there was\r\nan uncountable number of private initiatives.\r\nMr. Pallais (Nicaragua), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nA first evaluation of the Year’s observance at the\r\nnational level proves that it was possible to achieve a\r\nhigher awareness of family issues by the public and to\r\nenhance the status of family policy at the governmental\r\nlevel. Therefore, we are now confronted with the challenge\r\nof making use of the benefits achieved in 1994 to promote\r\na long-term process in which family matters can be pursued\r\nas priority policy issues. Attaining this objective will\r\nrequire the support of the following:\r\nFirst, on the basis of the results achieved by the\r\nworking groups, a long-term family programme is being\r\nelaborated; after endorsement by the Austrian Government,\r\nit should form a basis of Austria’s family policy at the\r\ntransition to the next millennium.\r\nSecondly, as an accompanying measure, an Institute of\r\nFamily Research has recently been established, with the\r\ntask of carrying out relevant research in support of the\r\ndecision-making process in the field of family policy.\r\nThirdly, it is intended to maintain the National\r\nCommittee on a permanent basis as a national coordinating\r\nbody on family issues.\r\nFourthly, involvement and participation at the local\r\nlevel has to be further strengthened. For this purpose, the\r\nholding of a session of Parliament with the participation of\r\na number of families is planned for the International Day\r\nof the Family in 1995. Depending on the outcome,\r\nholding this event on a yearly basis is being considered.\r\nFifthly, grass-root activities will be continued and\r\nfurther developed, with closer cooperation at the local and\r\ncommunity level. A new competition will be launched,\r\nwhich will reward community and family activities\r\ndevoted to the 1995 United\r\nNations Year for Tolerance.\r\nSixthly, cooperation with the media will be further\r\ndeveloped. Television commercials are in production\r\nwhich aim at increased public awareness of the important\r\nrole of the family as a social network and of the necessity\r\nof appropriate support for the family through society.\r\nThe achievement of these aims will undoubtedly\r\ndepend on the extent of international support for the many\r\nnational efforts in all the Member States of the United\r\nNations. Therefore, it would be desirable that family\r\nissues continue to play an important role within the\r\nUnited Nations. Accordingly, the valuable work carried\r\nout by the United Nations in connection with the\r\npreparation and implementation of the International Year\r\nof the Family should be continued.\r\nIn this connection, the declaration of a Decade of the\r\nFamily as well as the adoption of a long-term family\r\npolicy programme should be discussed as appropriate\r\nsteps in the continuation and further development of\r\nefforts in family policy at the international level.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nBefore calling on the next speaker, I wish to announce\r\nthat the President of the General Assembly has informed\r\nme that action on the draft resolution under agenda item\r\n14, \"Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency\",\r\nwill not be taken tomorrow, Wednesday, 19 October, as\r\nearlier announced, but rather next week, on a date to be\r\nannounced in the Journal.\r\nAgenda item 95 (continued)\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family\r\nInternational Conference on Families\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\nnext on the representative of Germany, Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Roswitha Verhülsdonk, Parliamentary State Secretary\r\nat the Federal Ministry for Families and Senior Citizens,\r\nwho will speak on behalf of the European Union.\r\nMrs. Verhülsdonk (Germany): I have the honour to\r\naddress the item on the International Conference on\r\nFamilies on behalf of the European Union.\r\nAlthough the International Year of the Family is not\r\nyet over and although many activities related to the Year\r\nare still to come, allow me to congratulate the United\r\nNations on the outstanding attention which the International\r\nYear of the Family has received all over the world. Our\r\ncongratulations and our thanks also go to the Coordinator\r\nof the International Year of the Family, Mr. Sokalski, and\r\nhis team for the relentless efforts they have undertaken to\r\nmake the Year a success.\r\nThe inventory of national action prepared by the\r\nsecretariat of the International Year of the Family lists an\r\nimpressive number of events organized at the local and\r\nnational levels to achieve the goals of the Year. In many\r\ncountries, national committees have been set up for the\r\npurpose of coordinating these activities. Governments have\r\ntaken stock of the situation of families in their countries by\r\npreparing national reports. Furthermore, the International\r\nYear of the Family has initiated important research\r\nactivities concerning family problems. Everywhere, these\r\nactivities have stimulated efforts at all levels, both in the\r\npublic and in the private spheres, to respond to problems\r\naffecting, and affected by, the situation of families. But\r\ndespite their variety and their specific focus, all the\r\nactivities undertaken during the Year have a common\r\neffect: taken together, they highlight the importance of\r\nfamilies, they promote a better understanding of their\r\nfunctions as well as their problems, they further our\r\nknowledge of the economic, social and demographic\r\nprocesses and trends affecting families and their individual\r\nmembers, and they focus attention on the rights, status and\r\nresponsibilities of all family members.\r\nFamilies today vary in their forms and functions from\r\none country to another, and within each society. This\r\nexpresses the diversity of individual preferences as well as\r\nof societal conditions. Political, economic, social and\r\ndemographic developments confront families in all societies\r\nwith serious problems. In Europe, the following elements\r\ncontribute to the transformation of family forms and\r\nstructures: increasing numbers of single-parent households,\r\nlargely headed by women; the later age of first marriages;\r\na decreasing number of children per family; an increasing\r\nnumber of elderly family members; the growing\r\nparticipation of women in the labour market; and\r\nchanging perceptions of the role of men and women and\r\nof the rights of children within the family - to name but\r\na few current trends.\r\nThe varying forms of families in different societies\r\nnotwithstanding, the International Year of the Family, in\r\nour view, declared that the family continues to be the\r\nbasic unit of society and that therefore the family should\r\nbe accorded the widest possible protection and assistance.\r\nFamilies play an important role in the socialization,\r\neducation and protection of children and in the\r\nintergenerational transmission of culture and values of\r\nsocial conduct, thus deeply influencing the social\r\nbehaviour of each individual. Hence, families and their\r\nindividual members should be afforded the necessary\r\nprotection.\r\nPolicies and measures in this field should be guided\r\nby the relevant provisions of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, the International Covenants on Human\r\nRights, the Declaration on Social Progress and\r\nDevelopment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child,\r\nthe World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and\r\nDevelopment of Children and the Plan of Action for\r\nimplementing that Declaration, the family-related\r\nprovisions of the Convention on the Elimination of all\r\nForms of Discrimination against Women and other United\r\nNations instruments which refer to the family.\r\nConsiderable efforts to further the objectives of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family have also been\r\nundertaken at the international level. There were very\r\ninteresting discussions on the issues of the International\r\nYear of the Family at the series of regional preparatory\r\nmeetings and at the World Forum of non-governmental\r\norganizations, held in Malta. The United Nations Europe\r\nand North America Preparatory Meeting for the\r\nInternational Year of the Family, held last year in\r\nValletta, Malta, adopted the Valletta Declaration on the\r\nprinciples, objectives and policy considerations of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. We consider a number\r\nof the recommendations in that Declaration to be of\r\nparticular importance even beyond the context of the\r\nYear. Allow me to mention just a few of them.\r\nA very important point made in the Declaration is\r\nthe call to alter conditions of work so as to allow family\r\nresponsibilities to be taken into account. The European\r\nUnion attaches great importance to finding flexible and\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\ninnovative arrangements and to implementing effectively\r\nexisting laws and regulations governing employment, in\r\norder to assist workers to reconcile family life and\r\nresponsibilities on the one hand and gainful employment on\r\nthe other. This was one of the issues discussed by\r\nEuropean Ministers responsible for family affairs at their\r\ninformal meeting on 15 September 1994 in Berlin. In\r\naddition to the 1992 recommendation on child care the\r\nEuropean Union is currently considering measures to\r\nimprove possibilities for parental leave and part-time work.\r\nFurthermore, a family and work network consisting of 12\r\nindependent expert consultants has been set up to consider\r\nthese matters further and to initiate action in the public and\r\nprivate sector.\r\nFurthermore, the Declaration points out that efforts to\r\nfacilitate the reconciliation of family responsibilities and\r\ngainful employment have to build on the recognition that\r\nfamily functions and responsibilities must be equally shared\r\nbetween men and women. A division of parental and\r\ndomestic functions and participation in paid labour formed\r\nsimply on the basis of gender, as in the past, runs counter\r\nto the fundamental principle of the equal status of men and\r\nwomen. Families will therefore greatly benefit from all\r\npolicies which aim at a new partnership between men and\r\nwomen. The European Union hopes that the fourth World\r\nConference on Women will make concrete proposals in this\r\nregard.\r\nWe also share the view that the public policy process\r\nat all levels of administration as well as in the private and\r\nvoluntary sector should develop family-sensitive policies in\r\nthe fields of housing, work, health, social security and\r\neducation in order to create an environment supportive of\r\nfamilies in their various forms. Appropriate consideration\r\nshould be given to assisting parents and caregivers and\r\nfamilies with special needs, including those having\r\ninsufficient levels of resources or having members with\r\ndisabilities or elderly persons to care for. In addition, all\r\nmeasures should reflect an understanding of the different\r\nways in which the needs and situation of families and their\r\nmembers change over the life cycle.\r\nAnother element which we find particularly important\r\nis the call for all States to take the necessary measures to\r\nprevent all forms of violence and abuse within families.\r\nFamily violence is one of the most insidious forms of\r\nviolence, particularly against women and children. It is\r\ncommitted in all societies. States have to ensure that laws\r\nagainst family violence and abuse, rape, sexual assault and\r\nother forms of gender-based violence protect the integrity\r\nand dignity of women and children. To this end, we urge\r\nall Governments that have not yet done so to ratify and\r\nimplement fully the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms\r\nof Discrimination against Women.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like to make one\r\nadditional remark. I mentioned earlier that the form and\r\nconcept of the family can vary from one State to another.\r\nBut whatever form it takes in a given country and\r\nwhatever the religious and ethical values, cultural\r\nbackgrounds and philosophical convictions of its people,\r\nthe European Union believes that relations within the\r\nfamily must be based on respect for the rights and dignity\r\nof each of its members. In this context, we would like to\r\nrecall the contribution to the International Year of the\r\nFamily by the Committee on the Elimination of\r\nDiscrimination against Women which, in its general\r\nrecommendation on equality in marriage and family\r\nrelations, has made specific proposals as to how effect\r\ncan be given to the articles in the Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen that are of special significance for the status of\r\nwomen in the family.\r\nLooking at the multitude of events, I am convinced\r\nthat substantial benefits for families can be reaped from\r\nthe ideas developed during the International Year of the\r\nFamily. However, this Year has to be seen as an\r\nimportant event within a continuing process. Three major\r\nconferences in the next two years, namely the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women and the United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II), will\r\naddress issues which are of great concern also for\r\nfamilies. I hope that they will take into due account what\r\nhas been achieved during the International Year of the\r\nFamily.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nnext speaker is the representative of the Slovak Republic,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Dusan Bella, Director-General of the\r\nMultilateral Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Slovak Republic.\r\nMr. Bella (Slovakia): The Slovak Republic has\r\nadopted a complex approach to the International Year of\r\nthe Family, on both governmental and non-governmental\r\nlevels.\r\nA particular contribution of the Slovak Government\r\nto the International Year of the Family was the launching\r\nof a new support programme targeting young families.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nThis coincided with the official visit to Slovakia, on 1 June\r\n1994, of the United Nations Coordinator for the\r\nInternational Year of the Family, Mr. Henryk Sakolski, who\r\nwas received by the President, the Prime Minister and other\r\nhigh-ranking officials. During 1994, the Slovak National\r\nCouncil adopted several important bills related to the social\r\nand economic welfare of families.\r\nAnother concrete activity of the Slovak Government\r\nwas the establishment of the International Centre of Family\r\nStudies (ICFS) in Bratislava in 1993, under the joint\r\nsponsorship of the Ministry of Labour, Social Welfare and\r\nFamily and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thus, the\r\nCentre became a focal point not only for national, but also\r\nfor international activities.\r\nThe Centre coordinates a series of research activities\r\nat the national and international levels with the aim of\r\nassessing the most urgent needs of, and problems related to,\r\nthe family. As an example, let me mention the\r\ninternational comparative research project: \"Possibilities and\r\nlimits of the family in present-day Europe\", or the\r\nsubregional project (Bratislava - Szeged - Zagreb) on\r\nfamily educational environment. The International Centre\r\nfor Family Studies has already organized several\r\nconferences and workshops with international participation\r\nsuch as, for example: \"Ethics in the family and in society\",\r\n\"Families with special problems\", \"Families in new\r\nsocio-economic conditions\" and \"The problems of small\r\ncountries and their future\". The Interregional Meeting of\r\nthe National Focal Points/Coordinators for IYF, to be held\r\nin Bratislava in February 1995, will be the culmination of\r\nour activities within the framework of the International\r\nYear of the Family.\r\nThe International Year of the Family was also an\r\nopportunity for a whole range of non-governmental\r\norganizations to address family issues through their\r\nactivities in the educational, cultural, humanitarian, health,\r\npopulation and other fields. The Slovak Catholic Charity\r\nopened a new Centre for Family and Education in\r\nBratislava. Children from the Chernobyl area came to\r\nspend their holidays with Slovak families. Abundant\r\ncultural events, such as a new cycle of family concerts and\r\nan exhibition entitled \"Child in the Family\", have taken\r\nplace.\r\nThe International Centre of Family Studies has been\r\ndeveloping its activities in the challenging environment of\r\nthe changing socio-economic situation of most families in\r\nthe region against the background of the ongoing transition\r\nand reform process.\r\nThe broad activities of this Centre have been\r\nappreciated by the United Nations Coordinator for the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. A feasibility study on\r\nthe possibility of affiliating the Centre with the United\r\nNations, in the sense of General Assembly resolution\r\n47/237, elaborated by a United Nations-mandated expert\r\nteam, took note \"with interest of the proposal by the\r\nGovernment of Slovakia that the Bratislava International\r\nCentre of Family Studies be affiliated with the United\r\nNations\". Currently, the Slovak Government is putting\r\nthe final touches to the corresponding draft agreement\r\nproposed by the United Nations IYF Coordinator. We\r\nwould highly appreciate friendly support for the affiliation\r\nof the International Centre of Family Studies in the very\r\nnear future. The Centre, having a very advantageous\r\nlocation in close geographical proximity to the United\r\nNations Office in Vienna, could become a useful basis for\r\nthe future follow-up activities of the International Year\r\nfor the Family in the region.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\nnext on the Permanent Representative of France,\r\nMr. Jean-Bernard Mérimée.\r\nMr. Mérimée (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nOn 8 December 1989, the General Assembly, in\r\nresolution 44/82, proclaimed 1994 the International Year\r\nof the Family, thus reaffirming its desire to give social\r\nquestions the place that the 1945 Charter had reserved for\r\nthem; ideological confrontations and the search for social\r\nprogress solely through economic development had led to\r\ntheir being lost sight of.\r\nThree weeks previously, the General Assembly had\r\nadopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and it\r\nwas considering holding a world conference on human\r\nrights. That was decided the following year, and in 1992\r\nit was decided to convene a World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. To this important programme one should\r\nnaturally add the Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment and the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, two topics to which the General Assembly\r\nregularly draws the attention of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe all realize the amount of work that these global\r\nevents involve for Member States and the Organization,\r\nand yet everyone buckled down to this common task with\r\nvigour and determination. Today we are concentrating on\r\nthe International Year of the Family, but we must place\r\nit in the context of our other endeavours.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nFrance viewed this Year as a special time to reflect on\r\nthe family and policies for the family, taking two facts into\r\naccount.\r\nThe French are profoundly attached to the family -\r\nparticularly the young people. A recent Government survey\r\nof young people aged 15 to 25, which elicited 1.5 million\r\nresponses, confirmed all previous studies. Young people\r\nplace the family at the head of their values. Family ties are\r\nwhat enable them to face more calmly a future that often\r\nseems to them uncertain and sometimes even frightening.\r\nOur people clearly accept the importance and\r\nlegitimacy of intervention by the authorities in support of\r\nthe family. There are four main reasons for that.\r\nFirst, the role of the family is acknowledged. Article\r\n16(3) of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nstates:\r\n\"The family is the natural and fundamental group\r\nunit of society and is entitled to protection by\r\nsociety and the State.\"\r\nAll French people recognize the validity of this formula,\r\nbecause for them the family has many roles. It is where\r\nchildren learn their rights and their responsibilities; each\r\nfamily member is responsible for the others and watches\r\nover the security of the group; natural solidarity is in\r\nevidence there, in particular between generations and in\r\nfavour of the weakest; it is where the common values of\r\nour society are passed on; and it is the foundation both of\r\ncitizenship and of social links. The family is therefore the\r\nguarantor of our shared future.\r\nSecondly, individual rights are recognized. No one can\r\ndoubt that France is committed to the inalienable rights of\r\neach individual and that support for families, whatever form\r\nthat support takes, is provided solely at their option and\r\nwith respect for the individual rights of each member. This\r\ncommitment finds expression in particular through the\r\nequality of men and women, the rights of children and the\r\ndetermination of families’ way of life.\r\nThirdly, the need for national solidarity is accepted.\r\nFamily policies reflect a concern for justice and social\r\nequilibrium. The solidarity effort is justified by the\r\ncollective dimension of the family as an institution which\r\nis the origin of the renewal of every society. While it is\r\nimpossible to define \"the family\", any family, its foundation\r\nhas always been a man and a woman determined to face\r\nthe future together and hoping to create life. This essential\r\nfunction of the family must be protected, and in and of\r\nitself deserves the solidarity of the nation.\r\nFourthly, the role of the State is recognized.\r\nPartnership and dialogue between the authorities and the\r\nfamily is a longstanding French tradition, which makes it\r\npossible to carry out regularly, at both the provincial and\r\nnational levels, an in-depth assessment of successes, to\r\nanalyse shortcomings, examine new approaches and\r\nconsider implementation of the resulting policies.\r\nOur family policies - I deliberately use the plural -\r\nhave objectives that are constantly adapted to changes in\r\nsociety: allow parents to realize their family plans and\r\nthus encourage births; ensure \"horizontal\" redistribution\r\nto compensate for the cost of bringing up children; or\r\nensure \"vertical\" redistribution, favouring families with\r\nthe lowest incomes?\r\nIn fact, the French Government is jointly pursuing\r\nall three objectives within the framework of a\r\ncomprehensive policy taking account of the aspirations\r\nand needs of families of all kinds, because families are at\r\nthe heart of most public policies.\r\nThe International Year of the Family has been an\r\nimportant time for France.\r\nFirst, as soon as his Government took office in 1993,\r\nThe Prime Minister, Mr. Edouard Balladur, started work\r\non a five-year law in support of the family, and it was\r\nadopted on 25 July 1994. The main provisions of the\r\nlaw, which improves even further our family support\r\nmeasures are:\r\nExtension of the parental education grant paid\r\nto a parent who ceases professional activity to\r\ndevote himself or herself to the education of an\r\ninfant under 3 years. It now goes into effect as\r\nof the second child and can be paid if part-time\r\nwork is involved. If both parents work part-\r\ntime, two allowances can be paid. From now\r\non, all wage-earners will be guaranteed their\r\njob back - or an equivalent job - when parental\r\nleave comes to an end.\r\nTraining of child-care personnel, working with\r\nyoung children, either individually or in\r\ngroups;\r\nImproving the right to leave for family reasons;\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nNew measures to support families with young\r\nadults to look after or where there have been\r\nmultiple births or adoption;\r\nFinally, progressive increases in pensions for\r\nwidows and widowers.\r\nSecondly, we have begun a major national dialogue.\r\nThe work done by the national Steering Committee of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family and the ensuing action will\r\nbe described in an official report to be presented on\r\n18 December by the National Coordinator to Mrs. Simone\r\nVeil, Secretary of State, Minister for Social Affairs, Health\r\nand Urban Development. It will be widely distributed in\r\nFrance and will also be sent to our foreign counterparts and\r\nto the Coordinator of the International Year in Vienna. A\r\ndocument summarizing the International Year’s progress in\r\nFrance has been made available to delegations today.\r\nIn its resolution 47/237 the General Assembly\r\nrequested the Secretary-General to submit next year specific\r\nproposals on the follow-up for the year. An interregional\r\nmeeting, to be held in Bratislava from 4 to 7 February\r\n1995, will deal with this question.\r\nI have stressed the importance and the interrelationship\r\nof our various activities. The World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and the Beijing Conference will undoubtedly\r\nin their turn contribute substantively to our undertaking.\r\nIn speaking at length at the beginning of my statement\r\nabout the basis of family policy in France, I was thinking\r\nof the follow-up to the Year. It must respect the following\r\nsimple principles: recognition of the role of the family;\r\nrespect for individual rights, including the rights of women;\r\nfree choice of family lifestyles; support for and protection\r\nof the family by society and the State; and partnership with\r\nfamilies and their representatives.\r\nOur Assembly has proclaimed 1995 United Nations\r\nYear for Tolerance. Tolerance is a noble, vital concept\r\nwhen applied to the family, because it belongs above all in\r\nthe private domain. While the authorities must show\r\njudgement, because families - let us be honest - can also be\r\nplaces of oppression and violence, we must accept\r\ndifferences when they accord with the major principles\r\nunderlying the legitimacy of our Organization.\r\nBecause it is in the family that we place our hopes in\r\nthe struggle against the rise of individualism, which\r\nthreatens our societies, we must all make sure that we\r\nprotect our families. While the follow-up to the Year must\r\nnaturally be carried out first - and principally - at the\r\nnational level, our Organization can help by proposing a\r\njoint consideration of principles, objectives and methods.\r\nFrance is resolved to take part in this future work, as\r\nit should enable all societies to enter the twenty-first\r\ncentury with a more hopeful outlook.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nnext speaker is the Permanent Representative of Malaysia,\r\nMr. Razali Ismail, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Razali (Malaysia): The Malaysian delegation\r\nwelcomes the declaration of 1994, in recognition of the\r\ncritical role of the family, as the International Year of the\r\nFamily. Since 1990 the Malaysian Government has\r\ndeclared 11 November each year Malaysian National\r\nFamily Day. But taking into account that this is the year\r\nthe United Nations has designated Year of the Family, the\r\nMalaysian Government has agreed to celebrate its\r\nNational Family Day on 15 May instead of 11 November.\r\nIn order to observe this important occasion, the Malaysian\r\nGovernment has allocated a budget of about $1 million to\r\nfinance relevant activities. The activities themselves\r\ncombine activities of Malaysian National Family Day and\r\nthose suggested by the United Nations for the\r\nInternational Year of the Family.\r\nThe marginalization of the family institution is a\r\nserious problem requiring the attention of all societies, in\r\ndeveloped as well as developing countries. The pressures\r\nexerted on the family are tremendous. The social\r\nproblems of development, poverty, joblessness and crime,\r\nas well as the competing and contradictory pressures that\r\nbear down on the individual and the family unit, have\r\ncontributed to the impairment of the ability of the family\r\ninstitution to perform its functions. We should\r\ncollectively recognize and address these problems. While\r\nnowadays one may stress the rights and ability of the\r\nindividual, my delegation believes that it would be wrong\r\nto do so at the cost of the attrition of the family as an\r\nentity. The individual and the family actually reinforce\r\neach other: individual rights complement consensual\r\nneeds. We see the breakdown of this premise as a\r\ncontributory factor leading towards serious polarization\r\nand challenges to societies, as can be seen in both\r\ndeveloping and developed countries.\r\nThe incidence of street children, child labour, child\r\nprostitution, substance abuse and crimes committed by\r\nyoung people is symptomatic of the breakdown of the\r\nfamily institution, attributable in the main to poverty and\r\nunemployment. The threat posed by criminal activities to\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nany society should not be downplayed or underestimated.\r\nThey have the potential to become a major destabilizing\r\nfactor in the body politic of States, as well as for the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe family is the building block of society. The role\r\nof the family in ensuring that human beings will enjoy a\r\nproductive life in a secure and safe environment, in\r\nharmony with nature, is paramount. The family remains\r\nthe most natural emotional, economic and security support\r\nfor each and every individual. For us in Malaysia, as in\r\nother places, the family is at the heart of an extended\r\nhuman relationship that must survive the process of our\r\ndevelopment and evolution and not be its casualty. Many\r\nsocieties long ago lost the ability to recognize and further\r\nnurture the family as the confluence of reconciliation,\r\nhealing and motivation. We regret that this has come about\r\nand that in some societies there is a sense of being adrift.\r\nThe experience that one goes through in everyday\r\nfamily life will shape one’s character, attitude, demeanour,\r\nmoral persuasion and various other human traits that\r\nultimately condition the way one interacts with the social\r\nand physical environment. The vital functions of the family\r\ninclude the upbringing of the young, through both formal\r\nand informal education. Indeed, there is mounting evidence\r\nthat the young traditionally learn most from their families.\r\nThe role of a family is not confined merely to the\r\nupbringing of the young. The family remains central in\r\ntaking care of the elderly as well. In fact, world-wide,\r\nGovernments are expected to face a serious problem\r\npertaining to the care of the elderly, especially the poor, the\r\nfrail and the destitute. The family has an instrumental role\r\nto play in reducing the burden of the State in the care of\r\nthe family. This ancient family role must be preserved and\r\npromoted. This will contribute to the strengthening of the\r\nfamily as an institution.\r\nThere are numerous measures that we can take,\r\nindividually and collectively, to strengthen the institution of\r\nthe family. Nationally, Governments should look seriously\r\ninto implementing agreements reached at various\r\ninternational conferences, such as the recently concluded\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development.\r\nIssues relating to family violence, child abuse, child care,\r\ncare of the disabled and the elderly, education, health care,\r\nthe care of orphans, housing and basic amenities are closely\r\nlinked to the integrity of the family institution, and they\r\nneed to be addressed in that context.\r\nMany pressures felt by families today, including the\r\nhigh cost of education, health care and basic amenities,\r\nare the result of unbridled and unsustainable development.\r\nThese problems often have severe negative repercussions\r\non families. Governments therefore have a moral\r\nobligation and a social responsibility to intervene and\r\nensure that the basic necessities remain within the reach\r\nof ordinary people.\r\nIn dealing with the issue of the family, we have to\r\naddress squarely the status and role of women. In many\r\nsocieties women have been the unacknowledged pillars of\r\nthe family. Emotionally and physically, they provide\r\nsuccour and sustenance to the family, and in many cases\r\nthey are the breadwinners as well. Society has to come\r\nto grips with the problems of women by devising\r\ninstitutional means to alleviate their burden, which will\r\nconsequently enhance the integrity of the family.\r\nLike others, we remain concerned over the\r\nincreasing incidence of women as single parents. The\r\nhardship and, indeed, the misery of these women must be\r\nacknowledged and alleviated through the provision of\r\nlegal and financial support so that these families will\r\ncontinue to survive. An essential feature of support for\r\nwomen must have, as its central focus, education. The\r\neducation of women is one way to enhance their status to\r\nensure that they can react to changing socio-economic\r\nsituations and be aware of the full extent of their rights\r\nand role within society.\r\nThe international community will have the\r\nopportunity to address again the issue of strengthening the\r\nfamily institution at the forthcoming World Summit for\r\nSocial Development. The issues which form the core\r\ninterest of the Summit - namely, poverty, employment\r\nand social integration - are directly related to the\r\nimportant role and function of the family. Poverty and\r\nunemployment often cripple the ability of families in\r\nproducing healthy, balanced individuals.\r\nThe United Nations, through such agencies as the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, has been\r\ninstrumental in helping developing countries to provide\r\nessential services to the people, thereby indirectly\r\nsupporting the family structure. These agencies must\r\ncontinue to do so. In fact, their activities must increase.\r\nTo enable an increase in these activities, it is imperative\r\nthat they have the resources. Donor countries should in\r\nfact increase their contributions to fund these agencies,\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nrather than reducing their contributions as current trends\r\nwould seem to indicate.\r\nMy delegation also believes that non-governmental\r\norganizations have a major role to play in alleviating the\r\npressures on families. Together with Governments and the\r\nlocal people, non-governmental organizations can play an\r\nimportant role in maintaining and, where possible,\r\nstrengthening the role of families. This is particularly\r\nimportant for non-governmental organizations from the\r\nSouth, which must work together with Governments to\r\nimprove the lot of the people. There is wide and ample\r\nscope for constructive interaction and engagement.\r\nIn conclusion, as mankind proceeds inexorably to\r\nimprove its standard and quality of life, it goes without\r\nsaying that the process must ensure the integrity and\r\nrelevance of the family. The well-being of the family is the\r\nbedrock of the international community as well.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on The Honourable Mr. Antonio Guidi, Minister for the\r\nFamily and Social Solidarity of Italy.\r\nMr. Guidi (Italy) (spoke in Italian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Let me begin by thanking the\r\nUnited Nations and the Coordinator of the International\r\nYear of the Family, Mr. Henryk Sakolski for organizing\r\nthis International Conference on the Family. While fully\r\nsupporting the statement made by my German colleague on\r\nbehalf of the European Union, I should like to add my\r\ncountry’s reflections on the crucial issue of the family.\r\nAnyone who has had prolonged professional contact\r\nwith disability is well-acquainted with the phenomenon of\r\nthose who either isolate themselves or become stubborn. I\r\nmay not have great or original ideas but I am certainly\r\nstubborn, and with stubbornness I will reconsider in my\r\nstatement certain terms that are used and abused. To have\r\nany impact on reality, they require continued use as well as\r\neffort on the part of both the speaker and the listener.\r\nAt the moment of making a decision, I often\r\nremember a motto I read years ago in the margins of a\r\nletter from the United Nations Fund for Population\r\nActivities: \"Today’s choices for tomorrow’s world.\" This\r\nreminds me of the great responsibility we all assume each\r\nday in working for the sake of future generations. Whoever\r\nwrote that motto in 1969 showed an awareness and\r\nforesight that has grown more relevant through time.\r\nUnfortunately, all too few people have made this intuition\r\ntheir own over the years.\r\nI believe that the United Nations showed the same\r\nawareness and foresight in proclaiming 1994 the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. This is the same year\r\nas the Cairo Conference on Population and Development\r\nand the preparations for next year’s Beijing Conference\r\non Women. In both Conferences, the central role of the\r\nfamily emerges as a reality at the crossroads of all the\r\nproblems of modern society.\r\nThe Cairo Conference reaffirmed the family as the\r\nnatural and fundamental nucleus of society, with the right\r\nto be protected by society and the State, as postulated in\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It then\r\nshowed the world how the family - in the many forms\r\nreflecting the various social, cultural and political systems\r\nin which it exists and develops - is currently going\r\nthrough a period of serious moral and material hardship.\r\nAnd the first people to be penalized by this hardship are\r\nchildren, the elderly and women, which can be three\r\nextremely vulnerable categories in the current social\r\ncontext.\r\nThe child, as the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\noften points out, is the subject most affected by society’s\r\nshortcomings. In poor societies, imbalances in\r\ndemographics and resources are created that generate\r\nsevere hardships affecting a child’s expectations of life,\r\nsuch as education, health and even dreams. Even in\r\nadvanced economies, children are often penalized and\r\nforced to make serious sacrifices, such as a significant\r\nreduction in their living space, less and less time from the\r\nadult and, in extreme cases, the loss of one parent.\r\nIt is my hope, and the social struggles of my country\r\nare testimony to the fact, that in planning and making\r\nlaws on children, we operate no longer from the adult’s\r\nperspective but from the minor’s. I ask this Assembly to\r\nreflect on the conditions of children who live in war\r\nzones. In the past 10 years, 1.5 million children have lost\r\ntheir lives in armed conflicts; 4 million have remained\r\ndisabled; 5 million are refugees; and 12 million have been\r\nuprooted from their home communities.\r\nThis list of facts shows us the dimensions of a\r\nphenomenon that I consider both terrifying and unworthy\r\nof a civil humanity, a humanity that should be a \"parent\",\r\nas the Pope said on the International Day of Families,\r\nquoting Genesis:\r\n\"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his\r\nmother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they\r\nshall be one flesh. In this union they transmit life\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nto new human beings: they become parents. In this\r\nway they take part in the creative power.\"\r\nIn 1990, at the World Summit for Children, 150\r\nGovernments signed a Declaration that guaranteed respect\r\nfor truces and special relief corridors for children in violent,\r\nwar-torn lands. These concepts were raised and broadened\r\nby the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which also\r\ncontains the proclamation of the right of all children to\r\nbasic health care, food and education.\r\nI hope that in the current year Governments that have\r\nnot yet signed the Declaration will do so, thereby allowing\r\nfor its full application.\r\nBut the niños de rua - the little slaves - of some zones\r\nin Asia are also fighting a daily war. This is a war that\r\nconsists of daily shortages and continuous abuses of power,\r\nand it is far from over. Unfortunately, it is now being\r\nextended to economically advanced countries that were\r\nconsidered immune. It too requires the drafting of an\r\ninternational treaty: How much is the life of a child worth?\r\nCairo conjugated development in the feminine, as I\r\nsaid there. But women, whom the Egyptian President\r\nMubarak called \"the cornerstone of our society\", represent\r\nthe second vulnerable element within the family. Since it is\r\nwithin our power, it is our duty to guarantee women certain\r\nrights, namely education and health care.\r\nOne fundamental point of reference is the issue of\r\nequal opportunity for men and women. Today, in many\r\ncountries and situations, the roles within the family and the\r\nsociety are too rigid. It is thus necessary to appreciate a\r\nwoman’s work in the family and even consider the\r\npossibility of paying her a salary; at the same time, it is\r\nindispensable to facilitate her entry into the work world and\r\nprotect her from every type of social discrimination. The\r\nGovernment Commission for Equal Opportunity established\r\nin Italy is working from this perspective.\r\nI hope that the participants in the upcoming Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women in Beijing can reach a\r\ngeneral consensus on these principles and draft precise\r\nrecommendations on the condition of women.\r\nWhat do we do for the elderly? I am referring to all\r\nthose who, having reached what their society considers an\r\nadvanced age, are unjustly relegated to the sidelines. The\r\nmain problems regarding the elderly can be summarized\r\nunder four headings: quality of life, health services,\r\nguarantee of employment for as long as the individual can\r\nor wishes to work, and integration into the family. Taking\r\ncare of the elderly is a duty towards those who in the\r\nrecent past bore the weight of our society on their\r\nshoulders. But it also and specifically meets the challenge\r\nof civility.\r\nThus, in part through the creation of a system of\r\nsocial support, we must restore the elderly to a central\r\nposition within the family framework. This would enrich\r\nyoung people by teaching them to appreciate those who\r\nby their example, dignity, experience and culture can\r\nprovide certainty in the present and guidance in the\r\nfuture. And if an elderly person has no family, or has a\r\nfamily that cannot maintain him or her within its nucleus,\r\nthe State must shoulder the responsibility for the creation\r\nof small structures that interact with the territory and the\r\npopulation.\r\nIn Italy, we have recently witnessed a significant\r\ndemographic drop caused by a tangible decrease in births.\r\nThis culminated in 1993 with fewer births than deaths. I\r\nbelieve that the low birth rate is caused in part by the\r\nemployment problem: Italy is one of the countries with\r\nthe longest waiting period between the end of a person’s\r\nstudies and the beginning of his or her work activity.\r\nAnother reason is the difficulty in finding housing and the\r\nscarce economic opportunities. There are also reasons that\r\nare not material, such as little faith in the future, lack of\r\ncontrol over one’s immediate situation, and the current\r\ntrend of young couples’ regarding a child as a curb on\r\ntheir freedom.\r\nMy goal has always been to make people understand\r\nthat a child represents the best investment for the future.\r\nTo this end, with full respect for the individual’s right to\r\nchoose whether or not to have a child, I feel it is\r\nindispensable to implement a series of tax breaks for a\r\nperson who decides to have one.\r\nOne phenomenon of great current interest is the\r\nincreasing number of families with one parent and one\r\nchild. This particular reality is very difficult for both the\r\nadult, who is often exposed and alone, and the child, who\r\nis the focus of all the adult’s affection. The child cannot\r\nshare this affection with other children in a society that\r\ntends to separate individuals, or with brothers and sisters,\r\nor with the other parent.\r\nAllow me to refer to what I regard as the ideal\r\nfamily, even it is difficult to put together. I call it the\r\n\"long\" family. It can respond to the many needs of a\r\ngrowing child through the daily commitment of the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\ncouple and the precious support of the elderly - I do not\r\nwish to be nostalgic but to look towards a possible future.\r\nThis family must treat, prevent, and settle social hardships -\r\na trustee of the highly delicate task of educating minors and\r\nprotecting the elderly and the disabled.\r\nThe \"long\" family can in fact help solve the\r\nemergency of solitude: the solitude of the elderly person,\r\nwho is ever more marginalized, and of the child, who is\r\nlistened to less and less. Such a family can give voice to\r\nchildren and space to the elderly, demonstrating that the\r\nsolution to this shared emergency can simply be to bring\r\nboth age groups together again.\r\nToday, thanks to technology, but thanks especially to\r\nan increasing awareness, the erroneous conviction that the\r\ndisabled cannot compete in social life is changing.\r\nAlthough this has allowed the less severely disabled to be\r\nintegrated into society and to express their potential, it has\r\nnot given everyone the same opportunity. In fact, at this\r\nmoment in the world there are millions and millions of\r\nprisoners. They are not victims of unjust regimes or of\r\nwars. They are the severely handicapped, prisoners of\r\nthemselves and of their homes and of their cities. Part of\r\nthe reason I am here today is to ask Governments to make\r\nit a priority to act on behalf of these people and at the same\r\ntime to recognize them as a social resource of humanity.\r\nThe problem of reuniting the families of immigrants\r\nleads inevitably to what emerged in Cairo as one of the\r\nmain problems facing humanity in the near future, namely,\r\nimmigration.\r\nThe solution to this problem must be sought in a\r\ntransnational framework, through a gradual rebalancing of\r\nindividual national economies and in full respect for the\r\nsocial and cultural independence of populations.\r\nImmigration will cease to be a problem only on the day\r\nwhen each State can guarantee acceptable living conditions\r\nto the citizens within its borders.\r\nI think that it is unacceptable today to talk about \"us\"\r\nand \"them\", to distinguish between the various populations\r\nthat inhabit the Earth. The foreigner must be treated as a\r\nfriend and, as such, as a possible resource for the host\r\ncountry. Until this happens, one of the problems posed by\r\nimmigration will be the reuniting of families, which is a\r\nfair expectation and a right for the millions of emigrants\r\nwho honestly pursue the dream of bettering their conditions\r\nof life by working in a foreign land.\r\nIn Italy we have adopted measures to create a\r\nsystem of rights and duties that respect human dignity.\r\nThese measures are designed to pursue and punish the\r\nminority of immigrants who live outside the law and at\r\nthe same time to guarantee a better standard of living to\r\nothers. This can be done in part through the utilization of\r\nsocial services, the acquisition of civil rights and the\r\npossibility of reuniting their families.\r\nGoing back to what I said in Cairo, I propose the\r\ninclusion of immigration-related issues in the agenda of\r\nthe next meeting of the G-7, in Canada. At the same\r\ntime I propose, as I did then, the organization of a world\r\nconference on the issue.\r\nI would also like to renew the proposal I made for\r\na conference on volunteerism, to be organized by Italy\r\nand to be held in the near future.\r\nIt is my conviction that volunteerism should be\r\nunderstood as a strong, founding value of a civil and\r\nunselfish society. It should be praised as a model for\r\novercoming hardship in a population otherwise lacking in\r\nideological points of reference. Volunteerism is also a\r\nresponse to shortcomings in the public sector and plays a\r\nrole, for example, in the creation of very important\r\ncentres for drug addicts, the handicapped and abandoned\r\nchildren. We must thus work to appreciate these\r\nfunctions and restore equal dignity to these systems,\r\nwhich must not be alternatives to public systems.\r\nVolunteerism is true treasure, and it will constitute one of\r\nthe fundamental values of the year 2000.\r\nI feel great sadness when I realize that people today\r\nno longer dream the impossible dream. But I am glad\r\nthat they seek instead a justice with human dimensions,\r\nan end to violence and the fulfilment of primary needs -\r\nall rights that should be concrete, natural and universal.\r\nIn this context I give great importance to the\r\nproclamation of 1995 as the United Nations Year for\r\nTolerance. Through a series of initiatives like those for\r\nthe Year of the Family, which is officially concluding\r\ntoday, that Year will prompt a series of reflections by\r\nGovernments and mankind on the true values on which to\r\nbase the future development of our society and individual\r\nlife. The first of these is solidarity.\r\nMy hope as Italy’s Minister for the Family is that in\r\nthe near future, through solidarity, old and new self-\r\ninterests and ethnic, social and religious hatred can be\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\novercome to achieve that superior good to which we aspire,\r\nnamely, peace.\r\nWhoever looks at reality without truly seeing it cannot\r\nunderstand. A child, a person in trouble or a small\r\nunfamiliar group of people may look like imperfect,\r\ndiscolored and useless pebbles in such a person’s eyes. If\r\nwe step back, however, broadening our perspective and\r\nadjusting our vision, we realize that these little pebbles\r\nmake up a fascinating mosaic. Each of them has the right\r\nto exist, to be a part of that tormented, splendid,\r\ncontradictory mosaic of humanity. Here, in this forum,\r\nwhere all voices are heard, it must come together and be\r\nseen in its totality. Each one must have a role and be\r\nheard. We will no longer need someone to speak for\r\nanother and another to hear. No later than tomorrow - or\r\neven today - we must enter into a mode of communication\r\nin which we will all have equal dignity of voice, tone and\r\nrole.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Win Mra, Permanent Representative of\r\nMyanmar.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar): With its adoption of resolution\r\n44/82 of 8 December 1989, the General Assembly\r\nproclaimed 1994 as the International Year of the Family.\r\nThis proclamation is important in that, by making it, the\r\nUnited Nations was for the first time drawing the attention\r\nof the international community to the special needs and\r\nimportance of the family. The resolution reaffirmed the\r\nimportance of the family as the most basic unit of society.\r\nIt also reawakened the international community to the role\r\nof the family in contemporary society and to the challenges\r\nit faces as a result of political, economic and social\r\nchanges. This is the most fitting occasion to examine the\r\nchallenges brought about by these changes and to formulate\r\nappropriate strategies.\r\nSince the proclamation, we have seen the smooth\r\nimplementation of a well coordinated and effective\r\npreparatory process. We can say with a sense of satisfaction\r\nthat the preparatory process has succeeded in promoting the\r\nobjectives of the Year and has resulted in crystallization of\r\nthe substantive concerns regarding families. Consequently,\r\nwe find ourselves today poised to embark on follow-up\r\nactivities.\r\nOne of the principles underlying the International Year\r\nof the Family is the need to undertake the activities of the\r\nYear at all levels - local, national, regional and\r\ninternational, with the primary focus at the local and\r\nnational levels. Only with sustained effort at these two\r\nlevels can the family regain its pivotal role in ensuring\r\nthe well-being of society. Today is the most opportune\r\ntime to take stock of activities at the national level.\r\nIn the Union of Myanmar many activities were\r\nundertaken during the preparatory stage - activities such\r\nas organizing child-development centres; holding contests\r\nfor children and giving prizes to the winners; and\r\narranging ceremonies for cash donations towards\r\nobservance of the International Day of Families.\r\nArrangements to coordinate departments’ observance of\r\nthe International Day of the Family were made in April\r\n1994. Non-governmental organizations were invited to\r\ntake part, in accordance with the objectives of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. The theme and the\r\nmotto of the Year were translated into the Myanmar\r\nlanguage, and both the English and the Myanmar versions\r\nwere published in local newspapers. All activities were\r\nbroadcast by Myanmar Television, beginning on 12 May\r\n1994.\r\nPursuant to General Assembly resolution 47/237, the\r\nInternational Day of Families was observed in Myanmar\r\non 15 May 1994 under the auspices of the Ministry of\r\nSocial Welfare, Relief and Resettlement. A special\r\nceremony was held to observe the Day, at which the\r\nMinister for Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement gave\r\nan account of the principles and objectives of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. Those attending\r\nincluded officials of the World Health Organization, the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund; heads of departments and\r\nenterprises; representatives of the Women’s Sports\r\nFederation, the Myanmar Red Cross Society, the\r\nMyanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association, the\r\nMyanmar Writers and Journalists Association and the\r\nUnion Solidarity and Development Association; and\r\nmembers of the Red Cross Brigade.\r\nThe highlights of the ceremony were the reading of\r\nthe message sent by the United Nations on the occasion\r\nof the International Day of Families; presentations by the\r\nPresident of the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare\r\nAssociation and the Chairman of the Myanmar Writers\r\nand Journalists Association on the International Year of\r\nthe Family; and the presentation of prizes to the winners\r\nof the children’s painting contests that had been held\r\nearlier. A commemorative theme song composed for the\r\nYear was also broadcast by Myanmar television on 15\r\nMay 1994.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nIn Myanmar the family is traditionally a close-knit\r\nsocial unit. It usually consists of three generations of the\r\nfamily living under one roof - children, parents and\r\ngrandparents. In addition, the predominant religion, culture\r\nand traditions of the land require that the family remain a\r\ncohesive unit for the development of the children and for\r\ntheir nurturing through proper upbringing.\r\nWhile caring for its other dependants, the family is\r\nmainly responsible for the growth and development of its\r\nmost vulnerable members - infants and children. The\r\nMyanmar family structure is conducive to this role.\r\nChildren are the object and focus of parental and\r\ngrandparental love. By tradition and culture, as well as by\r\nlaw, the rights of the child are conscientiously and\r\nscrupulously respected. Myanmar has always had legislation\r\nto protect children - for example, the Young Offenders Act\r\n1930 and the Children Act 1955.\r\nOn 16 July 1991 Myanmar acceded to the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child. As a State party, Myanmar has\r\naccepted a formal obligation to recognize and protect the\r\nbroad range of rights provided for in the Convention. On 14\r\nJuly 1993 Myanmar enacted new legislation on children and\r\nrepealed obsolete laws.\r\nThe aims of the new legislation are as follows: to\r\nimplement the rights of the child as recognized in the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; to\r\nprotect the rights of the child; to ensure that children may\r\nfully enjoy their rights under the law; to make provision for\r\nprotection of the best interests of the child, taking into\r\naccount the financial resources of the State; to ensure that\r\nthe custody and care of children in need of protection and\r\ncare may be undertaken by the State or by voluntary social\r\nworkers or non-governmental organizations; and to make\r\nprovision for the separate trial of juvenile offenders and for\r\nthe reform of children who have committed offences.\r\nUnder the new legislation, a child in the custody of a\r\ncruel or wicked parent or guardian is defined as being in\r\nneed of protection and care, and the State is required to\r\nintervene to protect the rights of such a child.\r\nThe Myanmar Government’s multifaceted measures to\r\nensure the nation’s development have resulted in an\r\nexpansion of social services. This is the outcome of\r\ninnovative social policies that address the needs of families.\r\nThese social services are being provided, not only by the\r\nGovernment, but also by non-governmental organizations.\r\nThe roles and functions of the family have changed,\r\nprincipally as a result of economic modernization and of\r\nmoral degradation and its concomitant circumstances.\r\nHowever, the fundamental character of the family as the\r\nnatural framework for providing its individual members\r\nwith emotional, financial and material support remains\r\nlargely unaffected. How to safeguard this basic character\r\nagainst the onslaught of contemporary pressures is the\r\nchallenge with which the international community is now\r\nconfronted.\r\nIn developing countries, where formal social security\r\nsystems are inadequate - indeed, in some cases such\r\nsystems do not exist - the family and the community are\r\nthe two entities that can provide individual social security.\r\nIt is therefore important for the developing countries to\r\nmaintain and strengthen the existing family structures and\r\nto promote the community spirit until such time as the\r\nState can afford an adequate and sustainable social\r\nsecurity system. My delegation believes that this is an\r\narea in which the international community could\r\ncomplement efforts at the national level.\r\nFor their part, the developing countries should have\r\nas components of their social policies plans and\r\nprogrammes to uphold the traditional values that underpin\r\nthe cohesiveness of the family. Mutual respect,\r\nunderstanding, consideration and tolerance should be\r\nnurtured and upheld at schools. Any future strategy must\r\nencourage the instillation of these time-tested values.\r\nMr. Abdellah (Tunisia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe International Year of the Family is one event\r\nwithin a continuous process and accordingly its\r\nobservance should not be an end in itself. It should\r\nconstitute an important starting-point in a long-term\r\nprocess. It will be pointless unless the proclamation of\r\n1994 as the International Year of the Family and all the\r\nactivities which the international community has\r\nrelentlessly undertaken from the preparatory phase to the\r\npresent lead to well-conceived strategies beneficial to\r\nfamilies. In drawing up these strategies, jettisoning of the\r\nobsolete concepts should be balanced with the\r\nmaintenance of the concepts and family models that still\r\ntend to contribute to the strengthening of the family as a\r\nbasic unit of society. My delegation fully supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s plans to have appropriate follow-up\r\nstrategies ready for timely submission to the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Juan Carlos Mato, Director-General for the\r\nLegal Protection of Minors, Ministry of Social Affairs of\r\nSpain.\r\nMr. Mato (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWhile fully supporting the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Germany on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, I should like to add to his statement a few general\r\nassessments and views which we, from the Spanish\r\nstandpoint, deem worthy of pointing out in the framework\r\nof this debate, appropriately taking place in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe celebration of the International Year of the Family\r\ndoes credit to the United Nations, in particular if we assess\r\nthe impact the Year has had on the international\r\ncommunity, especially at the region, national and local\r\nlevels. A decisive contribution was made during the\r\npreparatory process by the Coordinator for the International\r\nYear of the Family, Mr. Sokalski. Special mention should\r\nalso be made of the considerable work carried out by the\r\nvarious committees of the non-governmental organizations\r\non the family, in particular the work of the Vienna\r\nCommittee for the preparation of the World Non-\r\nGovernmental Organization Forum, held in Valletta, and\r\nother activities of particular importance.\r\nThe conclusions of the regional preparatory meeting\r\nfor the International Year of the Family for the countries of\r\nEurope and North America, as well as General Assembly\r\nresolution 47/237, continue to be points of reference for\r\nseeking common ground among various approaches to the\r\nfamily, its role in the society at the end of the century, the\r\npublic policies involved, and the role to be played by non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nAs we near the year 2000, the family continues to be\r\nseen as the basic unit of society in light of the key\r\nfunctions it plays at the heart of inter-generational\r\nsolidarity, and as the emotional, economic and material\r\nsupport its members need for their proper growth and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe family as an entity cannot be said a priori to be\r\n\"finished\" in a more or less defined way, nor do its\r\nfunctions appear to have been established once and for all.\r\nOn the contrary, it is seen as a constantly evolving,\r\nmultifaceted and dynamic reality, a producer of changes but\r\nalso affected by those changes. It is a social framework\r\nwhose role and functions cannot be seen as exclusively\r\nprivate units, but rather as public units in constant\r\ninteraction with demographic, cultural, political, legal and\r\neconomic phenomena.\r\nA clear recognition of the important social and\r\neconomic functions of the family has made us\r\nincreasingly aware of the effects changes in social\r\nstructure and in economic activity have had on the nature\r\nof what we today call a family, at times changing the ties\r\nand links which bind its members and even reducing the\r\nfamily’s capacity to satisfy basic needs. These changes\r\nhave opened our eyes to the existence of many different\r\nkinds of family units. That is why in our policies having\r\nto do with the family, we should attempt to avoid an\r\nexplicit or implicit promotion of a single ideal picture of\r\nthe family, and avoid basing these policies exclusively on\r\nstereotypes and models of the family that do not reflect\r\nexisting realities as a whole.\r\nFrom sociological data, we can conclude that the\r\ninstitution of the family plays a central role in the\r\nrenewed Spanish society at the end of this century.\r\nFamily life has received very high marks in surveys on\r\nwell-being. What is most interesting is the fact that these\r\nwell-being indicators are independent of other social\r\nvariables such as schooling, income and social class.\r\nUndoubtedly the family is the first educational\r\nenvironment in which an active and prolonged process of\r\nsocialization, learning and transfer of culture takes place.\r\nWithin the family, one can begin to promote true equality\r\nof opportunity for girls and boys to have access to\r\nculture, knowledge and democratic values.\r\nThe society and the State must provide the necessary\r\nenvironment and resources for families to exercise this\r\nbasic responsibility, while themselves fulfilling their own\r\nresponsibilities by ensuring universal, accessible, quality\r\neducation and thus promoting equal access to\r\nopportunities. This, moreover, involves educational\r\npolicies aimed at ensuring the effective participation of\r\nfamilies, children and teenagers in the educational\r\ncommunity.\r\nSimilar measures are also required for the protection\r\nand promotion of mothers in such areas as labour law and\r\nhealth policy, to make mother-child health services,\r\nfamily planning, and early detection and treatment for the\r\ndisabled universally available and accessible.\r\nEquality between men and women in the decision-\r\nmaking process, an equitable sharing of family tasks and\r\nresponsibilities at home, as well as the effective\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nachievement of democracy and equality in the public\r\nsphere, are closely linked to the process of promoting the\r\nindividuality and autonomy of women. The driving force\r\nfor change in the role played by women in our societies has\r\nbeen the involvement of women in the work place. This\r\nhas been an essential element in the development of\r\nsociety, as was made clear at the Conference on Population\r\nand Development.\r\nTherefore, meeting the new challenges of the modern\r\nfamily requires promoting all of its members through public\r\npolicies which will facilitate, among other things, a balance\r\nbetween family and work life.\r\nEstablishing individual needs and those of the family\r\nas a group in organizing daily family life will guarantee\r\nthat families can function. It is the basis for sustaining a\r\nnew social covenant in the private sector, a covenant\r\nbetween men and women, between children and adults,\r\nbetween the elders and the other members of the family -\r\na family covenant.\r\nThe International Year of the Family is serving as a\r\nplatform for the development of a wide-ranging discussion\r\nin Spanish society and in Spanish institutions of the new\r\nrole that the family has in these times, on demographic\r\nfactors, on relations between the individual, the family and\r\nsociety, and on legislation that affects families.\r\nThe Spanish Parliament has never had such intensive\r\nand important work to do as it has this year on policies\r\naffecting families and on the control to be exercised by the\r\nGovernment in this area. A parliamentary working group\r\non family policy has been set up. Experts, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and political heads of ministries\r\nthat have the most to do with family policies have appeared\r\nbefore that working group. The results of this work will be\r\nreflected in requests by the Congress to the Government.\r\nThe Senate has requested the Government to establish\r\nan inter-ministerial working group to draft a report on the\r\nsituation of one-parent families in Spain and draw up\r\nproposals to improve the most difficult social situations.\r\nFurthermore, the Government is setting in motion a range\r\nof family-policy measures, some of which I have already\r\nreferred to. Similarly, progress has been made in some\r\nautonomous and local administrations.\r\nMoreover, in connection with the celebration of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family, a National Committee has\r\nbeen set up in which experts, non-governmental\r\norganizations and representatives of the Central\r\nAdministration, autonomous communities and local\r\nadministrations are participating.\r\nAs regards substantive commitments, in the light of\r\nthe purposes and principles which the United Nations has\r\nproposed for the International Year of the Family, we\r\nhave drafted a Plan of Action which includes the\r\ncontributions of the members of the National Committee.\r\nThis Plan establishes the goals of campaigns to promote\r\ncommunications, awareness and exchanges of information\r\nduring the International Year of the Family which have\r\nbeen developed in Spain.\r\nThe International Year has already left a legacy for\r\nour families, our societies, our public administrations and\r\nour non-governmental organizations. It has been an\r\nopportunity for non-governmental organizations to be\r\nmore visible in our societies and for Governments to take\r\na more active interest in the needs and expectations of\r\nfamilies.\r\nThe activities connected with the International Year\r\nof the Family should be appropriately reflected in the\r\nactivities of the United Nations, and should be in keeping\r\nwith the important role families play in our societies. In\r\nany event, one line of future strategy will be the inclusion\r\nof the family perspective in activities carried out by the\r\nbodies and agencies of the United Nations system. In this\r\napproach, the personal and social development of all the\r\nmembers of the family should be taken into account.\r\nWe firmly support the decision by the United\r\nNations inter-agency meeting that the slogan of the\r\ncelebration in 1995 of the International Day of Families\r\nshould be: \"Tolerance Begins in the Family\".\r\nFinally, in drawing activities complementing the\r\nInternational Year we should take into account the reports\r\nthat will be made at the focal-point meeting of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family in Bratislava at the\r\nbeginning of next year, the statements on the family made\r\nat the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, and the results that may emerge from the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women.\r\nThe results of these international meetings will be of\r\nextreme importance in highlighting the importance of the\r\nfamily at the end of this decade, as we look to the future.\r\nHowever, of equal importance is our resolve to make\r\nprogress at the regional, national and local levels in\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nimproving the status and promoting the quality of life of the\r\nfamily in our societies.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Canada, Ms. Nancy Kilgour\r\nCarr, Federal Coordinator for the International Year of the\r\nFamily.\r\nMs. Kilgour Carr (Canada): Canada is proud to say\r\nthat it has taken an active role in celebrating the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. In our country,\r\ninternational years have often been milestones in the\r\ndevelopment of public policy and social action. However,\r\nto achieve that impact they must belong to Canadian society\r\nas a whole - its governments, institutions and communities.\r\nOnly that can create the broadly based effort needed to\r\nfocus attention on the issues that define the Year and the\r\nprogress we can make as a people.\r\nThat inclusive approach has been the policy of the\r\nGovernment of Canada to the International Year of the\r\nFamily. Canada is a large and diverse land. At a\r\ngovernmental level we are a federation in which all\r\nprovinces, territories and municipalities have programmes,\r\nservices and policies that affect families. After all, Canada\r\nis made up of millions of different families. All these\r\nfactors underline the value of reaching out to enlist wide\r\nsupport for the International Year of the Family.\r\nSince the decision of the General Assembly to\r\ndesignate 1994 as the International Year of the Family,\r\nCanada has taken action on many fronts. Our international\r\ncommitment has taken forms such as the decision to fund\r\na staff person at the International Year of the Family\r\nsecretariat in Vienna for a three-year period.\r\nThe Government of Canada recognizes the importance\r\nof families and is committed to providing a variety of\r\nprogrammes to support and enhance the well-being of\r\nfamilies. The federal presence in the International Year of\r\nthe Family is the Federal Secretariat for the International\r\nYear of the Family. It coordinates and promotes\r\nInternational Year of the Family activities and initiatives\r\nacross federal departments and agencies - for example,\r\npublic awareness, research, and working in partnership with\r\nother levels of government and non-governmental organizations -\r\nall for the betterment of families. A major component of\r\nthe Secretariat’s strategy has been participation in major\r\nfamily-related conferences, such as the one held in Victoria,\r\nBritish Columbia, on the United Nations Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child.\r\nUnder the theme \"Stronger Children - Stronger\r\nFamilies\", 800 international delegates were drawn from\r\nall sectors of society to discuss issues arising from the\r\nConvention. They looked at the needs of children in\r\nsituations of emergency, basic health and welfare needs,\r\nchildren and youth with disabilities, and a host of other\r\nissues.\r\nIn addition to the federal government’s work,\r\nindividual provinces and territories have formed groups or\r\nassigned staff to promote International Year of the Family\r\nactivities within their own jurisdictions.\r\nThe leading non-governmental organization has been\r\nthe Canada Committee for the International Year of the\r\nFamily. The federal government provided funds to\r\nestablish this independent, non-governmental organization\r\nin 1992. It has a board of directors made up of 32\r\ndistinguished Canadians. Since its creation, it has been\r\nactive in forming partnerships with other non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and business, labour and\r\ncommunity organizations.\r\nI could cite many examples of the Committee’s\r\nwork, particularly through its partnership with other\r\nfamily-related non-governmental organizations. The\r\nCommittee developed The Work and Family Challenge\r\nProgramme to make employers more aware of the\r\nrealities of balancing work and family responsibilities. It\r\ncommissioned a survey of public opinion on families and\r\nfamily life. It developed a learning and study guide about\r\nCanadian families that was distributed to all Canadian\r\nelementary school principals. As important, it has\r\nencouraged innumerable events at the community level.\r\nWe can say with confidence that Canadian\r\nnon-governmental organizations have played an active\r\nrole in promoting the International Year of the Family.\r\nLast week, in collaboration with the United Nations\r\nInternational Year of the Family secretariat, the Canada\r\nCommittee for the International Year of the Family, in\r\nconjunction with three Canadian non-governmental\r\norganizations, hosted \"Today’s Families: A Bridge to the\r\nFuture\", the closing conference for the Year. In his\r\nkeynote address to this conference, held in Montreal, the\r\nPrime Minister of Canada, the Right Honourable Jean\r\nChrétien, underlined the importance of strong families to\r\nsociety and the obligation Governments have to support\r\nthem. The Conference itself laid out many of the issues\r\nthat we must face long after the Year draws to a close.\r\nOne result of the Montreal conference is the\r\nnon-governmental statement about follow-up to the\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nimportant work that has been accomplished through the\r\nYear. That non-governmental document was presented here\r\ntoday.\r\nSome of the issues discussed in Montreal also form\r\npart of the agenda of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development. Canada endorses the\r\nprogressive recommendations that resulted from the\r\nConference and supports the Programme of Action agreed\r\nto in Cairo. In particular, we believe that improving the\r\nconditions of women and empowering them with choices\r\nwill help to build better families, better societies and a\r\nbetter world.\r\nIn the same way, we look forward to the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women, to take place in 1995. Canada\r\nbelieves that both conferences will benefit from the\r\nattention we have paid to the needs of families and all their\r\nmembers this year.\r\nOne of the most tangible effects of an international\r\nyear is its influence on public policy. In recent months, the\r\nGovernment of Canada has taken a series of steps that will\r\nhelp benefit families. On 26 July, the Minister of Health,\r\nthe Honourable Diane Marleau, announced the Canada\r\nPrenatal Nutrition Programme. This Programme will\r\nsupport comprehensive, community-based efforts to provide\r\nfood supplementation, nutrition and lifestyle counselling to\r\npregnant women with a high risk of low-birth-weight\r\nbabies. This Programme will help give the smallest, most\r\nvulnerable members of a family the healthiest start possible\r\nin life.\r\nOn 5 October, the Federal Government released a\r\ndiscussion paper in which the Canadian people are asked to\r\nhelp set contemporary social security priorities. For more\r\nthan 50 years Canadians have developed a large network of\r\nsocial programmes, and yet too many people find\r\nthemselves without the help they need to adapt to a\r\nchanging economy. One result has been an increase in\r\nchild poverty. Another has been an increase in the number\r\nof families at the margins of our economy and society. The\r\nGovernment of Canada believes a government committed\r\nto stronger families must work to address these issues. It\r\nis committed to doing so.\r\nThe impact of the International Year of the Family\r\nwill be felt in years to come through these issues and\r\ndecisions in both the private and the public sectors.\r\nCanadians have told us that families are important. They\r\nexpect all parts of society to work together to support\r\nfamilies. Canada is proudly taking on that challenge.\r\nThe President: I call on Her Excellency, the\r\nHonourable Isabelle Leeds, United States of America\r\nAlternate Representative to the Forty-Ninth Session of the\r\nUnited Nations, General Assembly.\r\nMrs. Leeds (United States of America): The United\r\nStates strongly supports protecting and strengthening the\r\nfamily as a basic social and economic unit. I would like\r\nto make a brief statement to describe the focus of some\r\nof the programmes in the United States leading up to the\r\nInternational Year of the Family.\r\nThe family provides the environment within which\r\nthe next generation is born, sheltered, nourished and\r\neducated. Mothers and fathers must nourish the child\r\nwith food and love, protect the child from harm, ensure\r\nthat the child is cared for when ill, and provide the\r\nchild’s early education. The concern, therefore, is not\r\nonly for children but for the capacity of parents to\r\nprovide adequate care and stimulation for their children.\r\nIn the United States, the Administration for Children\r\nand Families (ACF) of the United States Department of\r\nHealth and Human Services has been the designated\r\nFederal Government coordinator for the International Year\r\nof the Family. Promoting the economic and social\r\nwell-being of families, children and communities is the\r\nheart of the mission of the ACF.\r\nThrough its federal leadership, the ACF works to\r\nempower families and individuals to increase their\r\neconomic independence. The ACF works also to develop\r\nsupportive communities with a positive impact on the\r\nquality of life and development of people.\r\nThe ACF accomplishes its mission in partnerships\r\nwith many others such as frontline workers, communities,\r\nstates and native American communities, all joining\r\ntogether with one vision in mind: helping others.\r\nProgrammes and services administered by the ACF\r\ninclude: Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the\r\nnation’s largest cash assistance programme; Head Start,\r\na comprehensive child development programme for pre-\r\nschool children; Family Preservation and Family Support\r\nto assist families in crisis; and the Job Opportunities and\r\nBasic Skills Training Program, the nation’s education and\r\njob- training programme for welfare recipients along with\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\n60 other groups providing services to individuals and\r\nfamilies in need.\r\nOther departments and agencies of the Federal and\r\nstate governments have undertaken specific measures to\r\npromote the Year, including the Extension System of the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, which developed\r\na three-year plan of action for the year, the Library of\r\nCongress, the United States Agency for International\r\nDevelopment and the Peace Corps.\r\nThe Extension System organized a national task force\r\nmade up of Extension professionals and representatives\r\nfrom the private sector. The task force adopted three goals\r\nfrom the United Nations publication on the International\r\nYear of the Family as themes in focusing its own work\r\nprogramme. These goals were: first, strengthening the\r\nfamily’s ability to meet its own needs; secondly,\r\nunderstanding how families are affected by changes in\r\npublicly provided social services; and thirdly, recognizing\r\nthat some of society’s ills may adversely affect family\r\nrelationships and acknowledging that government\r\nintervention through social policy may be needed to modify\r\nnegative behaviour and discourage antisocial or detrimental\r\npractices in the family.\r\nThe national, state and local International Year of the\r\nFamily educational programmes of the Extension System\r\nwere implemented with an initiative that engendered a new\r\nfocus on the family, and events that ensured continued\r\nattention to the welfare of the family.\r\nThe importance of the family system in all societies\r\nwas also recognized by the United States Agency for\r\nInternational Development, which has adopted a closer\r\nfocus on the role of the family in development. This\r\napproach to development is based on the premise that\r\nsuccessful development must put people first through\r\nreflecting and responding to the realities and dynamics of\r\ndaily life, which are most keenly felt at the level of the\r\nfamily and household.\r\nTraditionally, development experts used gross national\r\nproduct statistics or numbers of targeted beneficiaries to\r\nmeasure the impact of their programmes. The result of this\r\nfocus on macro-level statistics or individual interventions is\r\nthat the family system, its role in society and its effect on\r\nindividuals tend to be overlooked. Because there are many\r\ndifferent family systems throughout the world, and even\r\nwithin countries, it is important to approach the design and\r\nimplementation of programmes with an analysis of how\r\nintra-family relationships and gender roles influence the\r\nallocation of resources to individuals.\r\nFocusing on families also highlights the fact that\r\nmost people operate as members of family systems, not\r\nas isolated individuals. The betterment strategies of many\r\nhouseholds depend on maximizing the productive use of\r\nfamily resources, often across intergenerational lines.\r\nIt is within families that most individuals are\r\nnurtured, sheltered, educated and allocated resources. It\r\nis within the family that many decisions, often difficult\r\nones, are made - whether or not to vaccinate a child;\r\nhow long a child attends school; whether to invest in a\r\nbusiness or spend on health and education. Health,\r\nhousing, income, education and other social and economic\r\nfactors are all interrelated, and it is within the family\r\nsystem that they come together.\r\nWe believe that focusing attention at the level of the\r\nfamily lets us see the interrelated needs of people so that\r\nassistance both at home and abroad can respond to their\r\nneeds and priorities, rather than reflecting primarily the\r\n\"solutions\" of development specialists. It means building\r\non the strengths and the potential of families, respecting\r\ntheir strategies for self-improvement and the rights of all\r\nfamily members.\r\nFurthermore, focusing on intra-family dynamics and\r\ntheir influence on the lives of the family members is\r\nfundamental to sustainable development. Development is\r\nbased on understanding how resources are allocated\r\nwithin the household, who controls the resources, who\r\nmakes the decisions, and why.\r\nToday, many families are faced with stress as a\r\nresult of poverty, disasters, disease, war or pandemics.\r\nAlthough families are resilient and have developed coping\r\nstrategies when faced with adversity, many become so\r\noverwhelmed that they are no longer able to cope. The\r\nmillions of children orphaned by AIDS or forced to work\r\nrather than go to school, or who are living or working on\r\nthe street, are manifestations of stress on family systems.\r\nInitiatives at all levels, national and international,\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental, need to enable\r\nfamilies to have access to more and better choices for\r\ntheir own futures. As consumers of services such as\r\nfamily planning, education, water and sanitation, housing\r\nand banking, family members make difficult decisions\r\nevery day regarding how they and their families will live.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nGovernment policies in different sectors must provide\r\nthe kind of environment within which families, whatever\r\ntheir structures, can not only survive but flourish. The\r\nknowledge and experience of non-governmental\r\norganizations are an invaluable resource. Often working in\r\nlocal communities, these organizations implicitly understand\r\nthe fact that the needs of individuals are influenced by their\r\nfamily’s resources, decisions and dynamics.\r\nIntra-household dynamics - what goes on within the family\r\n- influence not only who benefits, but ultimately whether\r\nthe family’s potential is realized.\r\nFor no matter what a family unit looks like today, the\r\nfamily remains the essential ingredient in shaping our later\r\nlives. All children need the love and support that only\r\ncaring parents, caring adults can provide. As First Lady\r\nHillary Rodham Clinton said in recent remarks to a\r\ngraduating university class,\r\n\"Family values alone cannot feed a hungry child,\r\nand material security cannot provide a moral compass.\r\nWe need both. We need both within our families.\r\nWe need both within our societies\".\r\nTwo major United Nations events will take place next\r\nyear: the World Summit for Social Development and the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women. These events,\r\nauspiciously occurring in the year of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations, will provide the opportunity to keep\r\nthe international spotlight on the family, and we hope that\r\nofficial documents now being drafted for these events will\r\nrecognize the important role of the family in the social and\r\neconomic development of all people.\r\nFor now, before the International Year of the Family\r\ncomes to a close, let us all take the time to show our own\r\nfamilies how much we cherish them, and to remember the\r\nneeds of families everywhere.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nnext on Her Excellency Mrs. Josefina Bilbao, Minister of\r\nthe National Women’s Service of Chile.\r\nMrs. Bilbao (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nam honoured to represent Chile before the Assembly, for it\r\nwas the wish of President Eduardo Frei to entrust the\r\nNational Women’s Service with the task of coordinating\r\nand implementing all activities involving women and\r\npromotion of the family as the key to the nation’s overall\r\ndevelopment. After chairing the national Commission for\r\nthe Family established by former President Patrizio Aylwin\r\nto carry out an in-depth study of the family in Chile and to\r\nprepare extensive diagnosis of the subject, I was\r\nappointed by President Frei to head this Ministry. I am\r\ntherefore in a position to say that for my Government the\r\nUnited Nations proclamation of the International Year of\r\nthe Family was not merely timely but far-sighted, both for\r\nmy country and for the entire international community.\r\nWe believe that the 1989 meeting marked a\r\nsubstantive advance in the promotion of human dignity\r\nand that it was far-sighted because the world has changed\r\nrapidly since 1989. In only half a decade a new\r\ninternational order has arisen. Its form is not yet clear,\r\nbut we know that it brings with it advances in freedom\r\nand cooperation; that the banners of democracy and\r\nhuman rights will be held high; that globalization will rise\r\nto unimagined levels; that markets will expand; and that\r\ninternational security will be more firmly guaranteed.\r\nBut in this new international order there will be a\r\ncruel rise in the inequality of opportunities throughout the\r\nworld. With the consolidation of societies that are freer,\r\nmore advanced technologically, more responsible\r\nenvironmentally and more pluralistic culturally, contrasts\r\npersist that are unacceptable to the conscience of\r\nmankind. Poverty, unfulfilled basic human needs,\r\nunemployment and intolerance are problems that continue\r\nto affect all countries, but they are tragic in developing\r\ncountries, and especially in the least advanced of them.\r\nIn this context, the family stands out once again\r\nconspicuously as the basic unit of society - overwhelmed\r\nbut also the source of meaningful change. It stands out\r\nas the natural structure for fostering the potentials of all\r\nits members, and as the irreplaceable agent for social-\r\ndevelopment policies.\r\nChile welcomed the United Nations call to\r\ncommemorate the International Year of the Family and\r\nwishes to share with the Assembly its pride at having\r\ndone so with conviction and commitment. For we\r\nachieved the first of the goals also we had set ourselves:\r\nputting the family on our civic agenda. Today we as a\r\nsociety are more concerned with the family, because we\r\nunderstand it better. Studies carried out as part of the\r\nYear showed that family-related aspirations are a high\r\npriority among the majority in our country, and that there\r\nare many kinds of families facing many kinds of\r\nproblems.\r\nA traditionally private subject has become a public\r\nconcern, and today we are redefining our social policies\r\nin terms of the criteria of integration and intersectoralism,\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nwhich arise when planning is no longer part of an abstract\r\nideal, but rather part of a flexible dialogue with reality\r\nitself.\r\nThe family is paramount for Chile because of our\r\ncultural identity, our historical memory and our traditions.\r\nHence, we all know that to preserve the family is to be\r\nresponsible for its development, for its changes, for its\r\nproblems and difficulties and for its vast creative\r\npossibilities as an agent of the values that mobilize us as a\r\nnation.\r\nWe know that in many countries macroeconomic\r\nstructural-adjustment policies have exacerbated\r\nunemployment and all the other manifestations of poverty\r\nand violence. We also know that there has been an\r\nespecially hard impact on women, owing to their position\r\nin the workforce and in the family. The reduction or\r\nelimination of social services has affected women’s access\r\nto employment and have transferred the burden of\r\nproviding those services to families - and within those\r\nfamilies, to women. This results from a structural situation\r\nthat places unequal value on the activities of men and of\r\nwomen. In that connection, I believe that the main changes\r\nin the family in recent decades relate directly to changes in\r\nthe status of women in various societies; we must recognize\r\nthat linkage in devising modern, democratic policies.\r\nChile has successfully made the transition to\r\ndemocracy; our rate of economic growth has been some 6\r\nper cent over the past decade. At the same time, our\r\nmodernization has been imbalanced, and poverty persists.\r\nThe Government of President Eduardo Frei has clearly\r\ndefined its priority: we aspire to the eradication of extreme\r\npoverty by the end of the century. In order to do this, we\r\nneed more democracy, improved economic growth and\r\nsocial policies that will provide equal opportunities for the\r\nmost marginalized. The family emerges as the prime and\r\nfundamental unit for the proper development of society.\r\nThe family is at the heart of our development aims,\r\nbecause in the family no one is superfluous, neither the\r\nelderly nor the disabled, nor can the new era be built as\r\nlong as the inequality of women and the marginalization of\r\nyouth persist, and as long as children continue to inherit\r\nfrom their parents and grandparents the lack of\r\nopportunities.\r\nBecause of this conviction, we strongly value the\r\ncontribution made by the various international conferences\r\nconvened by the United Nations on the relevant issues. It\r\nis therefore particularly important that this Conference\r\nprecedes the one that will be held next year in Beijing on\r\nthe subject of women.\r\nThe Sixth Regional Conference of the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean, held\r\nin preparation for the Beijing Conference, which has just\r\nbeen held in Mar del Plata, Argentina, came to the\r\nconclusion that we cannot conceive of the inclusion of\r\nwomen in the public sector unless there is greater equity\r\nin the private sector. This means that we also need to\r\npromote greater participation by men in family duties.\r\nThe International Year of the Family is a step\r\ntowards the Fourth World Conference on Women;\r\nchanges in individual sectors help to promote overall\r\nchange.\r\nThe Government of Chile is taking important strides\r\nin its social policies for the benefit of women who are\r\nheads of households and in its policies for dealing with\r\nthe situation of pregnant teenagers. We are developing a\r\nplan for the establishment of child-care centres for\r\nchildren of working mothers, and studies are being carried\r\nout with a view to creating networks for the support of\r\nvictims of family violence. We have also made progress\r\nin legal reform. A few weeks ago, the first legal text\r\ndefining and imposing sanctions on violence within the\r\nfamily was promulgated, and there has also been a reform\r\nin the legal status of married women.\r\nAt present there is a draft before parliament\r\nconcerning filiation, designed to ensure the equal status of\r\nall children before the law.\r\nAs regards our work in public policy, we are seeking\r\nto promote equality of opportunity for all types of family\r\nunits, and to make the family a place that generates equal\r\nopportunities and rights for all its members. All of this\r\nis in line with Chile’s ratification of international\r\ninstruments such as the Universal Declaration on Human\r\nRights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women.\r\nIn order to build a suitable national awareness, the\r\nGovernment has undertaken to encourage public debate\r\nand to open up opportunities for families, in various fields\r\nand spheres, thus increasing their resources and their\r\npossibilities.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 18 October 1994\r\nIn this task, the National Service for Women has\r\ncalled on public and private organizations and on society in\r\ngeneral to consider proposed policies that would benefit all\r\nfamilies, whatever their nature and their origin, with a view\r\nto promoting real equality of opportunity for all.\r\nOur commitment to generate clear equality of\r\nopportunity, without distinction as to sex or status, has also\r\nled us to participate with enthusiasm and hope in the World\r\nSummit for Social Development to be held by the United\r\nNations in Copenhagen next year.\r\nThe experience of developing countries has\r\nincreasingly shown us the hard truth that the democratic\r\npolitical system, as well as economic growth, will be\r\nhampered if they are not able to incorporate the most\r\nvulnerable sectors of society. It shows us also that\r\nwithout democracy and without growth it is also\r\nimpossible to eradicate poverty.\r\nThe three imperatives are not successive stages. We\r\ncannot attempt to be first rich, then free, and later on just.\r\nThis has always been the illusion of authoritarianism and\r\npopulism. We know the results.\r\nThe struggle against poverty is an imperative of\r\njustice, but it is also one of efficacy. Either development\r\nis by all and for all, or, in the long term, it is by and for\r\nno one.\r\nThe struggle against poverty, against discrimination\r\nand against injustice is also a global struggle. It is as\r\nglobal today as are the markets and the media.\r\nThroughout history the family, despite its infinite\r\nvariations, has always been the nucleus for the survival of\r\nmankind, as well as the great transmitter of the culture.\r\nToday too the family offers a great opportunity to make\r\nprogress in realizing the universal values on the basis of\r\nwhich the United Nations was founded: the values of\r\ndemocracy, of peace, of freedom and of justice. The\r\nfamily continues to be the first and the primary nucleus\r\nin the building of a better humanity.\r\nI am grateful for the opportunity to reiterate the\r\ncommitment of the Government and people of Chile to\r\nthe celebration of the International Year of the Family.\r\nHere, we have sown the seeds of the future, and the\r\nharvest, we are sure, will bear the fruit of human dignity.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.25 p.m.\r\n29\r\n"
