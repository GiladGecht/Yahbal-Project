(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 95 (continued)\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family\r\nInternational Conference on Families\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nfirst on the Parliamentary Secretary of State, Ministry of\r\nWelfare of the Republic of Hungary, Mr. Mihály Kökény.\r\nMr. Kökény (Hungary): Let me state at the outset\r\nthat the Government of the Republic of Hungary joined\r\nwith pleasure and enthusiastic dedication in the United\r\nNations initiative proposing that 1994 should be the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. Our pleasure and\r\ndedication were fuelled by the recognition that the family\r\nis a fundamental resource of the community and of society,\r\nand that, due to the manifold conflicts inherent in today’s\r\nworld, an increasing proportion of families need continual\r\nsocial support.\r\nThis need for support is particularly prevalent in\r\ntoday’s Hungary. As members are aware, my country is in\r\na state of transition. This process, accompanied by\r\neconomic recession, has generated numerous social\r\nconflicts. Our Government and vulnerable Central and\r\nEastern European Governments have been described as\r\nrowing between the Scylla of an overburdened State\r\nbudget and the Charybdis of the political unpopularity of\r\nsocial budget reform offering less-than-universal benefits.\r\nThis scenario requires increased efforts to educate the\r\npublic about the viability of various options, about the\r\nlong-term costs of attempting to maintain a virtually\r\ndefunct system and about the strength of solidarity based\r\non cooperating families.\r\nIn my country all significant political elements agree\r\nwith the slogan offered by the United Nations for this\r\nspecial year:\r\n\"Building the smallest democracy at the heart of\r\nsociety.\"\r\nWe understand and recognize that the family - the heart\r\nof society - is also the smallest unit of democracy. We\r\nbelieve that democracy begins with the family. A\r\ndemocratic society can be built on the basis of democratic\r\nfamilies alone. Conversely, families that are democratic\r\nin their internal relationships can develop and function\r\nexclusively in democratic societies.\r\nIn Hungary the Year of the Family has, in\r\naccordance with the recommendations of the United\r\nNations, been intended as neither a single, isolated action\r\nnor as a representative campaign. It has been considered\r\nas an opportunity to call attention to the problems of\r\nfamilies and, as such, perhaps to start rational political\r\nand social actions with a permanently beneficial influence\r\non the lives of families.\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nThe direct impact of unfavourable demographic\r\nchanges on the life of the family is evident in the\r\ncontinuous reduction in the number of children per family\r\nin Hungary as well as in many other Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries. This issue should not be considered\r\nexclusively from the standpoint of social policy. As we all\r\nknow, a community of brothers and sisters creates a better\r\nand socially healthier environment for the child. The\r\nnumber of children is partially dependent on the scale of\r\nvalues prevailing in the family. For instance, how intense\r\nis the motivation and will of the parents to take on the\r\nresponsibility of bringing up more children? On the other\r\nhand, there are also economic factors to consider: Are\r\nthere enough resources to support more children without\r\nbringing the family’s standard of living below the society\r\naverage? We intend to consider both these factors in the\r\ncourse of developing Hungarian social policy. We are\r\nfirmly committed to the development of a social policy that\r\nwould provide more comprehensive support for families\r\nwith several children.\r\nWith regard to governmental measures, the system of\r\nfamily allowances will be developed further in Hungary.\r\nWe intend to introduce more measures favouring\r\nunemployed parents and impoverished families with several\r\nchildren. A child care allowance will be available on\r\ncondition of citizenship as of 1 January 1995. The\r\nlegislative preparations for the Act on Child Welfare and\r\nProtection have started. The Government will submit the\r\ndraft bill to the Parliament early next year.\r\nWith this in mind, let me raise a point for further\r\nconsideration. A United Nations statement on family-policy\r\nguidelines, similar to the Declaration of the Rights of the\r\nChild, is lacking. Such a document may promote the\r\nelaboration of national family strategies in Member States.\r\nPerhaps the forthcoming World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment will dwell upon this issue.\r\nThe International Year of the Family has been marked\r\nby numerous national and international programmes in\r\nHungary. Among the international events, we could\r\nmention the family conferences held jointly with our\r\nneighbouring countries. Many families met during these\r\nevents, which shows that borders and walls previously\r\nseparating them have now disappeared. I must also\r\nmention the noble gestures made by our families who have\r\nhastened to help refugee families that have been separated\r\nand driven from their homes. International charity\r\norganizations have been of great help in this work.\r\nI would like to express our thanks to the\r\nrepresentatives of the States present here who have\r\ninformed us about their national programmes. We\r\nconsider the Salt Lake City Family Patron City\r\nProgramme to be an excellent initiative. Over 21\r\nHungarian cities have joined it, and in the years to come\r\nit plans to operate an international network among the\r\nfamily-patron cities.\r\nI consider it very important to change our current\r\nconcept of the family. Stepping out of narrow frames, it\r\nshould be able to integrate the right to coexistence of all\r\nthose who - as Austrian Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat put\r\nit so aptly at the Twenty-third Conference of Ministers of\r\nFamily Affairs in Paris - form the community of\r\ngenerations bearing responsibility for each other within\r\nthe family. We can now see the United Nations in the\r\nsame way: as a family of nations bearing responsibility\r\nfor each other.\r\nIn the course of the Year of the Family, Hungary\r\nhas opted for the path of development by choosing the\r\nfamily. Our motto for the Year of the Family expresses\r\nthis well: everyone needs a family, and the family counts\r\non everyone. We thank the General Assembly for giving\r\nus this Year.\r\nFinally, let me read out a message from Mrs.\r\nZsuzsanna Göncz, wife of His Excellency the President of\r\nthe Hungarian Republic, to the participants of the\r\nInternational Conference on Families in New York:\r\n\"I would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy appreciation for the valuable efforts made by the\r\nUnited Nations to look for solutions and responses\r\nto the burning questions of social problems we are\r\nfacing today. I firmly believe that the family, as the\r\nsmallest unit of society, is the most suitable cell for\r\npeople to discover all forms of traditions and, at the\r\nsame time, to learn the various rules of our social\r\nlife. Therefore, I believe there is a pressing need for\r\nrecognizing the irreplaceable role of the family and\r\nmaking every effort to restore its honour, for the\r\nsake of mankind and future generations. Being a\r\nmother as well as the wife of the President of the\r\nRepublic of Hungary, I hope that with my humble\r\ncharity activities I can contribute to the revival of\r\nthe family in Hungary. I wish the General\r\nAssembly all the best in its work and success in its\r\nnoble efforts.\"\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Aleksander Luczak, Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister of Education of Poland.\r\nMr. Luczak (Poland): I am honoured to address this\r\nAssembly of representatives of States from all over the\r\nworld.\r\nIt is a matter of special satisfaction to me that it was\r\nPoland that first came up with the initiative to proclaim an\r\nInternational Year of the Family, following its earlier\r\nproposal to draw up a Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild. In proposing that the United Nations proclaim an\r\nInternational Year of the Family, we were guided by the\r\nbelief that the family has always played an essential role in\r\nthe lives of individuals and society alike. It fulfils\r\nextremely important functions, both economic and\r\neducational. It enables people to express themselves in\r\neveryday life and stimulates positive emotions.\r\nIndeed, the family constitutes a universal social unit\r\nwhich closely integrates the interests of the individual and\r\nthe public. Basically, it performs a similar role in all\r\ncountries, regardless of social and economic systems,\r\nreligious beliefs or social and regional circumstances. The\r\nleading moral, political and religious authorities have been\r\nturning to the family as the most durable asset and primary\r\nhope for the future, for the family is the first and\r\nirreplaceable educator, the basis for the transmission of the\r\nvalues system and inter-generational experience.\r\nThe people of Poland have always cherished family\r\nlife. The Polish family has preserved national culture and\r\ntransmitted its values to the young generations, even though\r\nby the eighteenth century the country had disappeared from\r\nthe world political map. The family played a distinctive\r\nrole in maintaining national identity.\r\nThe fundamental political, social and economic\r\ntransformations in today’s world have a bearing of their\r\nown on the functioning of families. As a result, the\r\npriorities of social and individual values are changing, as\r\nare the norms, patterns and models of life. Yet nothing can\r\nreplace the family in its educational and social functions.\r\nTherefore, it is of singular importance to draw the attention\r\nof the international community to the need for a\r\ncomprehensive approach to the family in order to ensure\r\nthe family’s development and provide it with satisfactory\r\nliving conditions and protection.\r\nTo some extent these issues were tackled by the World\r\nConference on Human Rights, held in Vienna last year.\r\nThe same issues are also being pursued by various\r\ninternational governmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations. Documents produced by these forums,\r\nincluding the Final Document of the recent Cairo\r\nConference on Population and Development, the\r\nMaastricht Treaty’s provisions regarding social policies\r\nand the papal proposal for a charter of the rights of the\r\nfamily, to mention but a few, tend to define a universal\r\nfamily policy. Efforts are being made to formulate a\r\nuniversal declaration on the rights of the family that could\r\nbe adopted by the General Assembly. This is surely a\r\nchallenge, in view of the different family-life traditions in\r\nvarious countries. I hope, none the less, that obstacles to\r\nsuch a declaration will be surmounted.\r\nSystemic changes under way in Poland, including the\r\nadvanced stage of transition to a market economy,\r\nnecessitate the prompt elaboration of a new concept of\r\nsocial policies, particularly with respect to families. It is\r\nimportant that such efforts be woven into a coherent\r\nsystem covering legal regulations, financial and in-kind\r\nsubsidies and services offered by public institutions.\r\nDuring the ongoing transformations in Poland, a host\r\nof negative phenomena affect families: falling standards\r\nof living; rising unemployment; and emigration or job-\r\nseeking abroad. Credit facilities for housing are scarce\r\nand expensive. Companies have drastically reduced the\r\nscope of social benefits. Consequently, the economic and\r\nsocial security of many families has diminished. It is\r\nincumbent upon the Government to cushion the negative\r\nside-effects of transition - without altering the essential\r\ndirection of reform.\r\nDuring the International Year of the Family the\r\nGovernment of Poland has taken specific actions in\r\nfavour of the family:\r\nThe 1994-1997 Programme of Socio-Economic\r\nPolicies contains a comprehensive pro-family\r\npackage. Some of its measures have already\r\nbeen set in motion.\r\nReform of the social security system is subject\r\nto intensive analysis.\r\nTax privileges have been introduced to favour\r\nmarried couples and single parents.\r\nAn improved mother-and-child and young\r\npeople’s health- care programme is being\r\nimplemented.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nA system of family doctors is planned.\r\nFamily-friendly hospitals are being created.\r\nA debt-reduction programme in respect of public\r\nschools taken over by local councils, subsidized\r\nfrom the State budget, is in operation.\r\nThe State budget covers arrears of interest for\r\nhousing credits owed to banks.\r\nMany ad hoc steps have been taken to help\r\nchildren with disabilities and to help young\r\npeople.\r\nWe are aware that all this is far from sufficient.\r\nUnfortunately, the country’s present economic situation\r\ndoes not permit us to do more, nor can we afford to\r\nincrease our budget deficit.\r\nThe United Nations did well to focus on the family in\r\n1994. The family has become the subject of wide-ranging,\r\nactive and constructive international collaboration. Support\r\nfor the family is a fundamental social responsibility for\r\nevery Member State, whatever its social and political\r\nsystems and no matter what differences exist in terms of\r\nreligion or customs. Let me take this opportunity to\r\nexpress our appreciation to the Coordinator of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family and his staff for\r\ndischarging their responsibilities in successfully preparing\r\nfor this important event.\r\nMany activities directly related to the International\r\nYear of the Family have been launched in Poland. Last\r\nApril we hosted in Warsaw the XVIII International\r\nCongress of Families, organized in close cooperation with\r\nthe World Organization for the Family, with broad support\r\nfrom the Catholic Church in Poland.\r\nSmaller-scale events have also taken place, including\r\na conference organized by the Polish Consumers\r\nFederation. Further symposia and conferences on the\r\nfamily are planned.\r\nThe National Committee for the Year of the Family is\r\nactive in Poland. It was set up on the initiative of the\r\nPolish Parliament and is headed by the Speaker of its lower\r\nChamber. One of the Committee’s top priorities was, in\r\naccordance with United Nations guidelines, to initiate\r\nnational and local actions to alleviate the hardships of\r\neveryday life of families and assist the resolution of\r\nconflicts within the family.\r\nThe Committee succeeded in organizing summer\r\nholidays for a large number of children from low-income\r\nfamilies and for children requiring special care. On its\r\ninitiative, a number of local committees were formed in\r\nthe provinces. Together with other nongovernmental\r\norganizations, those committees launched social welfare\r\nactivities and the counselling of women and set up clubs\r\nand care centres for children, the elderly and young\r\npeople from low-income families and from families at\r\nrisk.\r\nThe observance of the International Year of the\r\nFamily in my country will thus contribute to the\r\nelaboration by the Government and non-governmental\r\norganizations of various forms of assistance to the family\r\nand its members in this difficult period of systemic\r\ntransformations. To this end, the Polish National\r\nCommittee has outlined as its long-term objectives and\r\nfollowing up to the International Year: elaborating a\r\nnational programme of action in favour of the family,\r\nwomen and the younger generation; making necessary\r\namendments to laws and regulations so as to improve the\r\ncondition of family life and the well-being of the younger\r\ngeneration; introducing national and local measures to\r\nease the hardships of everyday life of families; interesting\r\nthe media in family issues; promoting such values as\r\nmutual respect, tolerance, solidarity and responsibility\r\nwithin the family; persuading researchers to take up the\r\nsubjects of the modern family and its perspectives;\r\norganizing conferences on the role and function of the\r\nfamily under present conditions of social development;\r\nand increasing cooperation with national and international\r\norganizations on family-related issues.\r\nWe are determined to continue working together\r\ntowards the multifaceted development of the family,\r\ntaking advantage of such forthcoming international\r\noccasions as the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nto be held in Copenhagen next spring, or the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women to be held next autumn in\r\nBeijing.\r\nWhen the International Year is over concern for the\r\nwelfare, stability and sustained development of the family\r\nshould continue to be at the centre of the attention of the\r\ninternational community, the United Nations system, and\r\nregional and non-governmental organizations. My\r\nGovernment fully supports extension of the efforts to\r\nattain the noble goals of the International Year of the\r\nFamily and shares the lasting commitment of the United\r\nNations to the family.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Portugal.\r\nMr. Soares (Portugal): It is a great honour for me to\r\naddress the International Conference on Families on behalf\r\nof my country and to have this opportunity to express views\r\non such crucial issues as those relating to the International\r\nYear of the Family.\r\nThe Parliamentary State Secretary in the Federal\r\nMinistry of Families and Senior Citizens of Germany has\r\nalready addressed the Conference on behalf of the 12 States\r\nof the European Union, expressing positions that Portugal\r\nfully subscribes to. Nevertheless, I would like to convey\r\nsome reflections relating to matters of great interest to my\r\ncountry.\r\nWhen 1994 was proclaimed the International Year of\r\nthe Family, the General Assembly reiterated that the United\r\nNations had acknowledged that families were the basic\r\nunits of social life. In the same vein, the major United\r\nNations instruments on human rights and social policy call\r\nfor the widest possible protection to be accorded to the\r\nfamily.\r\nIn my country the family occupies a key position in\r\nthe political and social system. We believe that the family\r\nis an essential element in achieving the cohesion of the\r\nsocial fabric. It is within the family that individuals can\r\nbegin to develop their personalities to fulfil themselves as\r\nhuman beings, and it is within families that the different\r\ngenerations can find better opportunities to come together\r\nand interact.\r\nThese concerns found a place in the Portuguese\r\nConstitution, which states that the family, as a fundamental\r\nunit of society, is entitled to the protection of society and\r\nthe State and to the creation of all the conditions necessary\r\nfor the personal realization of its members.\r\nThe family as a source of moral values is an age-old\r\nreality for us, one that has stood the test of time and\r\nresisted the challenge of fashion and circumstance. The\r\nPortuguese policy on the family takes into account\r\nmodernity and progress and is inspired by the development\r\nand improvement in material living conditions, but it\r\nremains deeply committed to the humanistic values of a\r\npeople and nation with many centuries of history.\r\nThe International Year of the Family was therefore,\r\nfrom the Portuguese point of view, a most welcome\r\ninitiative, and Portugal has participated wholeheartedly in\r\nits observance. I should like to recall that we established\r\na Commission for the International Year of the Family,\r\npresided over by the Prime Minister. Among other\r\nactivities, the Commission undertook a programme to\r\nheighten public awareness of the theme \"Family, a value\r\nto be promoted\". The Commission carried out its work\r\nin close cooperation with local and regional authorities,\r\nschools, churches and non-governmental organizations, in\r\norder to achieve the goal of creating, among policy\r\nmakers and the public at large, greater awareness of the\r\nfamily as the natural and fundamental unit of society.\r\nI should also like to avail myself of this opportunity\r\nto thank the Coordinator of the International Year of the\r\nFamily, Mr. Henryk Sokalski, for the support he gave us\r\nand to congratulate him and his collaborators for the\r\nexcellent work that has been done so far.\r\nThe International Year of the Family should\r\nconstitute the starting-point of a long-term process. Its\r\nfollow-up deserves special attention. We must ensure that\r\nthe ideas and recommendations that were put forward will\r\nmaterialize in concrete actions.\r\nNext year two important world conferences will take\r\nplace - the World Summit for Social Development and\r\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women to be held in\r\nBeijing - in which issues related to the family will be at\r\nthe centre of the debates. In this context, I should like to\r\nunderline our main concerns on family policies.\r\nOur basic aim will be to promote the widest possible\r\nprotection and assistance to the family as the basic unit of\r\nsociety, so that it may fully assume its responsibilities\r\nwithin the community, and at the same time to ensure the\r\npromotion of equal and full enjoyment of the human\r\nrights of all family members, with special emphasis on\r\nthe equal rights, responsibilities and participation of\r\nwomen.\r\nAs has frequently been said on other occasions, the\r\nfamily, as the natural and fundamental group unit of\r\nsociety, is the fullest reflection of the strengths and\r\nweaknesses of a community. As such, the family is the\r\nideal framework for an integrated and comprehensive\r\napproach to social policies. The promotion of a strong\r\nand dynamic family is an important element in the\r\nconstruction of an equally strong, democratic and dynamic\r\nsociety.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to express the hope that the\r\nwork of the International Year of the Family will\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\ncontribute to the fulfilment of one of the themes of the\r\nUnited Nations - to build the smallest democracy in the\r\nheart of society.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The next\r\nspeaker is the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Labour,\r\nHuman Services and Social Security, of the Republic of\r\nGuyana, Ms. Claudette Moore, upon whom I now call.\r\nMs. Moore (Guyana): It is indeed a great honour for\r\nme to address this meeting on a matter of considerable\r\nimportance to my country and to the international\r\ncommunity of nations. I bring with me the hope that this\r\ndebate will assist in the furtherance of our work in the\r\nInternational Year of the Family, and particularly in the\r\nelaboration of an international plan of action.\r\nThe situation of the family is precious in Guyana, a\r\nland of six peoples who nevertheless have one destiny, for\r\nwe subscribe to the dictum that a nation is as strong as its\r\nfamilies. In fact, the President of the Cooperative Republic\r\nof Guyana, in addressing a rally to usher in the\r\nInternational Year of the Family in January 1994, made the\r\npoint that:\r\n\"The family is obviously the nucleus of all social,\r\neconomic and political aspects of life, bound together\r\nby blood, unity of purpose and, most of all, tradition.\r\nAnd this family nucleus influences future generations.\"\r\nThe United Nations declaration of 1994 as the\r\nInternational Year of the Family was timely and afforded\r\nus, not only the opportunity to refocus on the importance of\r\nthe family, but to formulate a national plan of action which\r\ncould take us beyond the end of 1994 and into the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nIn this connection a National Coordinating Committee\r\nwas established in November 1993 to give effect to those\r\nefforts. The objectives of the National Committee were,\r\nfirst, an increased awareness of family issues at the level of\r\ngovernment as well as in the private sector; secondly, the\r\nstimulation of efforts to respond to problems affecting and\r\naffected by the situation of families; an improvement in the\r\ncollaboration among national and non-governmental\r\norganizations in support of multisectoral activities and,\r\nlastly, building upon the results of international activities\r\nconcerning women, youth, the aged and the disabled.\r\nGiven the broad objectives and the seriousness\r\nattached to each objective, it was found desirable to\r\nestablish subcommittees under the following headings:\r\nmoral and legal, the disabled, youth, and the work\r\nenvironment. Members of the subcommittees were drawn\r\nfrom government agencies and from non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nHowever, we did not leave the matter there, for it\r\nwas recognized that the public must be sensitized. Hence,\r\nthe Minister of Labour, Human Services and Social\r\nSecurity, whose Ministry was designated as the focal\r\npoint, delivered a New Year’s message outlining the\r\ntheme, objectives and programme for the Year. He also\r\nexpressed the hope that the activities would\r\n\"leave a lasting impression upon our minds and\r\npermanently guide our actions related to the uplifting\r\nof the family and our nation\".\r\nImmediately following this announcement, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, and in particularly the\r\nChurch, initiated a launching ceremony at which the main\r\nspeaker was His Excellency Dr. Cheddie Jagan, the\r\nPresident of Guyana. Programmes of awareness extended\r\nthrough March 1994 and involved government officials as\r\nwell as Guyanese families.\r\nI shall now focus on the more serious work of the\r\nsubcommittees that I identified earlier.\r\nThe Moral and Legal Sub-Committee has produced\r\na draft family code. This was disseminated across the\r\nnation on 15 May 1994, which was observed as the\r\nInternational Day of Families. Work will continue with\r\na view to incorporating all the views and issues that\r\nshould be contained in such a code. This Sub-Committee\r\nhas also begun to work on proposals for the establishment\r\nof a family court, with some input from senior legal\r\nprofessionals.\r\nThe Sub-Committee for the Disabled will shortly\r\nexecute plans that have been made for what is called\r\nDisability Awareness Month, which will commence on 4\r\nNovember 1994 and will culminate, on 3 December, in\r\nobservance of the International Day of the Disabled.\r\nThe activities that are planned will focus on the\r\nmentally retarded, the physically handicapped, the visually\r\nhandicapped, and the deaf and blind. The Ministry of\r\nHealth, as Guyana’s lead Ministry on disability, is in the\r\nprocess of reorganizing and expanding the National\r\nRehabilitation Committee as a National Commission on\r\nDisability, one of whose first tasks will be the\r\nformulation of a national disability policy.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nGuyana can be described as a young country as 40 per\r\ncent, or more, of its population are below 35 years of age.\r\nProgrammes to demonstrate the importance of youth and\r\nthe complementary nature of family members in the\r\ndevelopment of literacy skills, civic consciousness, moral\r\neducation and family values were undertaken in\r\ncollaboration with the Commonwealth Youth Programme as\r\npart of our observances.\r\nThis approach, involving the training and guidance of\r\nsemi-literate people by literate members of society, was\r\nintended to emphasize the position and status of the family\r\nas a key social institution, to reinforce family ties and to\r\nhave a multiplier effect on the rest of society.\r\nConsistent with its commitment to youth, the\r\nGovernment submitted a paper on national youth policy in\r\nJune 1994. It is intended that the mechanisms established\r\nwill provide young people with scope for self-expression\r\nand will make provision for appropriate programme\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe efforts of the Work Environment Committee, on\r\nthe other hand, are geared to securing the involvement of\r\nthe private sector and social-service institutions to assist in\r\nimproving working conditions for people with family\r\nresponsibilities. We have set as the major focus the\r\nachievement of the International Labour Organization’s aim\r\nof ratification of Convention 156 during this year or shortly\r\nthereafter. In August 1994 a national workshop was held,\r\nwith representatives of government, trade unions, employers\r\nand non-governmental organizations participating. It is\r\nnoteworthy that, as a consequence, Guyana has fulfilled all\r\npreliminary legal requirements for ratification of this\r\nConvention.\r\nConventions 100, 111 and 142 having been ratified,\r\nthe Constitution of Guyana provides every citizen with the\r\nright to work and to free selection in accordance with social\r\nrequirements and personal qualifications. It also provides\r\nfor men and women to enjoy equal rights and the same\r\nlegal status in all spheres of economic life. In addition, the\r\nEqual Rights Act 1990 removes all forms of discrimination\r\nbased on sex and provides for equal opportunities for men\r\nand women. The work of this Committee is therefore\r\nconcentrated on the establishment of the social\r\ninfrastructure that is necessary to alleviating the burden of\r\nfamily responsibilities on the productivity of workers.\r\nThe establishment of adequate care facilities for\r\nchildren in and out of school, elderly people and other\r\nfamily members is currently being examined. As an\r\nextension of our work in this area, Guyana will join other\r\ncountries in the Caribbean in a regional workshop later in\r\nthe year. It is hoped that efforts will then be combined\r\nto develop strategies for implementation of the\r\nConvention at the regional level.\r\nGuyana has signalled its commitment to \"the\r\nemergence of a global humanitarian order\" in which\r\ninternational development and cooperation will focus on\r\nthe welfare of people. The circumstances of people who\r\ncomprise a family unit are many and varied. Nevertheless,\r\nif given the necessary resources and support through\r\nappropriate legislation and policy, families could play a\r\nmajor role in advancing development.\r\nChanges in the structure and composition of families\r\nhave been almost universal, but important socio-economic\r\nand cultural functions performed by families should be\r\npreserved and transmitted to succeeding generations.\r\nGuyana will therefore seek to ensure that a plan of action\r\nis informed by the deliberations and activities of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family, with goals peculiar to\r\nour local situation but consistent with the universality of\r\nthe human family.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nmeeting began at 10.10 a.m., yet only eight out of 184\r\ndelegations have representatives in the Hall. The eight\r\ndelegations, which include those of the first three\r\nspeakers in the debate, are those of Egypt, Germany,\r\nHungary, India, Poland, Portugal, the United Arab\r\nEmirates, the United States of America.\r\nI now call on Ms. Mercedes Pulido Briceño,\r\nMinister for the Family of Venezuela.\r\nMrs. Pulido de Briceño (Venezuela) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): The Government of Venezuela attaches\r\nparticular importance to the discussion of social matters.\r\nWhen we speak of social matters we necessarily look to\r\nthe major agent in the building of society, which is, of\r\ncourse, the family.\r\nThe International Year of the Family, as one of the\r\nmajor political and economic events that have affected\r\nour lives, has been a focus for action and for recognition\r\nof the fact that the aspirations of society go beyond the\r\nobvious, beyond the mere meeting of basic needs, and\r\nseek fulfilment in people’s hopes and values.\r\nVenezuela has welcomed large waves of immigrants.\r\nIn the framework of a mixture of races, we have a society\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\ncharacterized by egalitarian values. In our society the\r\nfamily has been the meeting place between the aspiration to\r\nequality on the one hand and, on the other, the need to\r\nmake up for many deficiencies. Cultures meet in the\r\nfamily, and social mobilization is part of that reality.\r\nWe are aware that there may be discrimination, but\r\nabove and beyond this we have a society which is hard to\r\nclassify socially. The many years of extolling\r\nindividualism have not undermined our families. Their\r\ndaily lives are marked by friendship, interaction and\r\nsolidarity. We are grateful for this opportunity, at such a\r\ndifficult time, to focus our attention on the family, to\r\ndiscover all the ways in which it is organized, as a flexible\r\nand clear response to the need to adapt to new times. The\r\nrealities of shortages and changes in family life in our\r\nsociety demonstrate that decisions based solely on the quest\r\nfor material and technological progress are outdated. Now\r\nmore than ever we must address the cultural values and\r\naspirations that give meaning to our lives as we face the\r\nfuture.\r\nHow can coexistence be achieved without\r\nstrengthening people, the basis of the entire life cycle. The\r\ninstitution of the family is the basic cell, because that is\r\nwhere we are born, where we live and where we die. Until\r\nrecently, the family was a purely private setting; we were\r\nindifferent to it; we did not want to get involved in the\r\ndiscussions that were part of everyday life. We wanted to\r\ndevote ourselves only to ensuring the normalcy of the\r\ncollectivity. However, the fact is that today family\r\nviolence, crime, drugs, abuse and slavery are part of family\r\nrelations. They are part of our families’ daily lives, based\r\non traditional habits and values that will determine our\r\nfuture.\r\nHow can we envisage democracy if the family does\r\nnot understand the need to strengthen democratic links from\r\nthe very moment we come into the world? Can we claim\r\nto be able to face the future without identifying the right\r\nkinds of social relationships, limiting ourselves to satisfying\r\nbasic, partial needs? Poverty is not simply a matter of\r\nsocial indicators. It is a culture of survival, in which\r\nhumans wear themselves out day after day trying to look\r\nbeyond the next 24 hours. In this world, there is not time\r\nto develop options or opportunities or aspirations to build\r\nsocial relations that go beyond the immediate.\r\nResponsible parenthood, which is a reality in our\r\nregion, is not simply a matter of will. Among our young\r\npeople today, 30 per cent are excluded from the school\r\nsystem, while 20 per cent leave the school system for a life\r\nof poverty. One cannot be a responsible parent if one\r\ndoes not have the ability to produce the income that is\r\nnecessary to provide for the needs of a household, if\r\nsociety has not redefined the role of men vis-a-vis the\r\nadvancement of the status of women, if poverty means a\r\nlack of prospects for the future. How can one assume\r\nresponsibility without taking all those factors into\r\naccount?\r\nThe International Year of the Family has involved\r\nopening up new channels for discussion in Venezuelan\r\nsociety. The disabled; children with special problems; the\r\nelderly - who have been ignored up to now; street\r\nchildren; working children; those bound by slavery, to a\r\ncertain point, in the rural areas; mothers who themselves\r\nare only children; what we call the feminization of\r\npoverty: these are all factors which cannot be dealt with\r\nin isolation.\r\nThirty-eight percent of our population -\r\n580,000 families - lives in a state of critical poverty.\r\nMany of them are products of migration. Our country, in\r\nthis context, is a symbol of prospects for the future. We\r\nare not yet able to deny this opportunity to other peoples,\r\nbut we must also face our inability to find our own\r\nidentity. Social problems associated with poverty result\r\nin a lack of participation in society. Our challenge is not\r\njust to develop social-integration policies; we must aim\r\nfor a model of development which will make it possible\r\nto include major sectors of society, with their own\r\nparticular and very real circumstances, and change the\r\nnature of current participation so as to develop an overall\r\nvision.\r\nWhat has been the strategy of our country? Three\r\nmajor problems have been the focus of our attention.\r\nFirst, there are the children under six years of age. Here,\r\nin addition to health, nutrition and education indicators,\r\nwe have seen a great expansion in household-centred\r\nprogrammes and day-care programmes, in which the\r\nworking mother, is given the option of being incorporated\r\ninto civil society through other channels that enable them\r\nto do more than just meet basic needs, channels for\r\nparticipation in local decision-making, channels for\r\nparticipation in the decentralization of the country.\r\nThe second major problem is the eight- to sixteen-\r\nyear-old category. We have not forgotten the adolescents.\r\nWe are talking, really, about children under six and about\r\n18-year-olds. This is our major social challenge. That is\r\nwhy we have a wide-ranging programme - like our\r\nAyacucho Fund - that uses oil income for the training of\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nhuman resources in higher education. We have allocated\r\n4 billion bolivars for training our citizens, for integrating\r\nour young people from 8 to 16 years old into the labour\r\nmarket.\r\nThe diversification of the local economy could be an\r\noption for the future, but at the present time, our local,\r\ninformal economy, without technology or social security,\r\ndoes very little to incorporate our young people. I should\r\nlike to take this opportunity to outline the major options\r\ninvolved in our definition of family policy.\r\nMrs. Burmester de Maynard (Uruguay), took the\r\nChair.\r\nPublic policies, focused solely on caring for vulnerable\r\nsectors of the population, are merely a segment of the\r\nconcept of integration. Family policies should regard the\r\nfamily as a component of the social, political and economic\r\nelements.\r\nI wish to make another point that I find interesting.\r\nWhile it is very tempting to focus on the most vulnerable,\r\nwe also need to develop élite groups that have the ability to\r\nshape and direct that sector. If the State is to have an\r\nauthoritarian and centralizing role, it must involve all the\r\ngroups of civil society, not simply as interlocutors of the\r\nState, but as interlocutors of a society which is also capable\r\nof diversification.\r\nThere are two aspects to the readjustment of family\r\npolicies. First, we believe that assistance policies are\r\nneeded. When we have such large sectors that are poor, we\r\ncannot expect them to have the strength to make the\r\njourney by themselves. It has often been said that we\r\nshould not give the people fish, but should teach them how\r\nto fish. But we wonder if it is not also necessary to give\r\nthem the strength to hold the fishing-rod.\r\nThe second aspect relates to social-investment policies\r\nin which the conditions are established for the family to\r\nplay its socializing role. We cannot blame families for not\r\nplaying that role if we take away from them the tools for\r\nchange. Why do we take the family into account\r\nnowadays? Because technological and material progress\r\nhave failed to respond to our needs for development as\r\nhuman beings. If, as has been stated in the context of the\r\nsocial summit, we really want to design participative\r\npolicies, then family policies must provide for relations of\r\ninterdependence; of globalization of the problems of\r\nsociety; of reinterpretation of the values of equity, solidarity\r\nand civil responsibility. The collectivity must be rebuilt as\r\nan expression of all human beings. Only in this way can\r\nwe say that we are really caring for our people.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the representative of China, Mr. Wang Xuexian.\r\nMr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): The United Nations is a big international\r\nfamily composed of 184 Member States. It is therefore\r\nnot only appropriate but also very important for this big\r\nfamily to devote these meetings of the General Assembly\r\nto a commemoration of the International Year of the\r\nFamily. This in itself shows that the question of the\r\nfamily has become an issue of greater significance to the\r\ninternational community as well as an important item on\r\nthe agenda of the United Nations.\r\nOn behalf of the Chinese Government, I wish\r\nwarmly to welcome the convening of these meetings. We\r\ndeeply appreciate the fruitful work carried out by the\r\nSecretariat of the United Nations, the regional preparatory\r\nmeetings and, in particular, Mr. Sakolski, Coordinator for\r\nthe International Year of the Family.\r\nSince the adoption by the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-fourth session of the resolution which proclaimed\r\n1994 the International Year of the Family, countries in all\r\nparts of the world have made positive responses.\r\nCentring on the year’s theme of \"Family Harmony and\r\nProgress\", national Governments and the international\r\ncommunity as a whole have all worked enthusiastically in\r\nthe wide-ranging preparations for the Year. These\r\nactivities have helped draw people’s attention to the\r\nquestion of family, deepened their understanding of\r\nvarious economic, social and population elements of the\r\nissue of family, enhanced the various countries’ efforts in\r\nformulating or adjusting their family policies and\r\nprogrammes, and promoted international cooperation in\r\nthe sphere of the family.\r\nIt has always been an important part of the Chinese\r\nculture to attach importance to families and their values.\r\nThis tradition has been enhanced by the development of\r\nfamily relations towards equality, democracy and\r\nharmony. We the Chinese have always taken pride in our\r\nhappy and harmonious families. China now has more\r\nthan 260 million families; they constitute the structure of\r\nChina’s modern society, abounding with unprecedented\r\nvitality. The healthy build-up of these families, which\r\nenables people to live in harmony and friendship, is\r\nconducive to the stability and development of the entire\r\nsociety. The Chinese Government has responded actively\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nto the International Year of the Family and carried out a\r\nseries of instructive activities, including some of the\r\nfollowing events.\r\nIn May last year, China had the honour to invite\r\nrepresentatives or observers from 26 countries and regions\r\nand 17 United Nations agencies and non-governmental\r\norganizations to participate in the Asia and Pacific Regional\r\nPreparatory Meeting for the International Year of the\r\nFamily, held in Beijing. The meeting was highly\r\nsuccessful, and the Beijing Declaration it adopted was\r\nviewed with favour by all sides.\r\nIn February 1993, the Chinese Government set up its\r\nown Coordinating Committee composed of representatives\r\nof a dozen Government departments and organizations.\r\nOver the past year China has carried out many diverse\r\nactivities, organized and guided by its national Committee.\r\nOn 15 May this year, Beijing celebrated the\r\nInternational Day of the Family. Many specialists, scholars\r\nand governmental officials participated in the activities,\r\ngoing into the main streets and outdoor public places to\r\nexplain and give advice and answer questions on China’s\r\nfamily law and to share their specific legal and scientific\r\nknowledge.\r\nOn the same day, the award ceremony for the Model\r\nFamily was held. Before the ceremony, there were\r\nnation-wide activities in connection with the choice of the\r\nmodel family. Thirty families won gold, silver and other\r\nhonourary awards. They are all families that have made\r\nsignificant contributions to society and enjoy family\r\nharmony and rich family life, thus winning great respect.\r\nSpecial television programmes on the family, including\r\nperformances by individual families, have been shown.\r\nSimilar performances have also been telecast at the grass-\r\nroots level in both urban and rural areas.\r\nSeminars on family culture have been conducted for\r\nan exchange of views and useful experiences and to put\r\nforward recommendations for future work.\r\nThe International Symposium on the Family and the\r\nNext Generation was held to discuss the building of family\r\nculture and youth education.\r\nThese activities are very popular among the Chinese\r\npeople and have helped deepen people’s affection for\r\ntheir families.\r\nIt is well known that the family is the natural and\r\nbasic unit of society and plays a very important role in\r\nsocial development. The family is both the beneficiary of\r\nand the active participant in social development. Without\r\nhappy and harmonious families, it is impossible to\r\nmaintain a happy and harmonious society. We therefore\r\nbelieve that it is essential for the activities of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family to continue in the\r\ninterest of individual families as well as all mankind.\r\nThe Chinese Government and people are willing to work\r\nwith other members of the international community and\r\nto make their due contribution to collective efforts.\r\nFinally, we wish to express our sincere hope that all\r\nfamilies in the world will have a life full of sunshine and\r\nlove, that every child in the world will grow up loved and\r\ncared for, that all the elderly will be well provided for\r\nand live in comfort, that all families in the world will\r\nenjoy harmony and progress, and that society will enjoy\r\npeace and development.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\non the Permanent Representative of Paraguay, Mr. José\r\nFélix Fernández Estigarribia.\r\nMr. Fernandez Estigarribia (Paraguay)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): I have the honour of\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Group of Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States at this meeting on the International Year\r\nof the Family.\r\nThis commemoration is particularly timely, now that\r\nthe subject of the family has been reinstated on our\r\nagendas. If we look at the Constitutions of all the\r\ncountries in our Group, we find that, for the most part,\r\nthey explicitly guarantee the rights of the family.\r\nFurthermore, none of us can turn our back on the\r\nimportant debate that the family is deeply engaged in\r\ntoday. Although we accept the family’s historical values,\r\nit is at present in a state of flux because of the staggering\r\nchanges that have taken place in world society.\r\nWhen we speak about change in our societies and its\r\ninfluence on the issue now before us, it cannot escape us\r\nthat the family is at the same time and from another\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nstandpoint a powerful renovating agent. It is in the family\r\nthat generally accepted knowledge is reassessed and subtly\r\nadded to and changed, without losing sight of the essential\r\nvalues of our common civilization.\r\nFor this reason strengthening our democracies also\r\ninvolves intensifying the debate on the role of the family\r\nbecause of its influence as a first educator of free and\r\negalitarian consciences.\r\nThis of course is a long-standing concern of the\r\nUnited Nations. To prove that assertion, we need only\r\nglance again at the remarkable Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child, one of the most broadly ratified instruments.\r\nFor that reason we cannot fail to mention the\r\nmomentous conclusions of the regional preparatory meeting\r\nwhich took place in Cartagena, Colombia, from 10 to 14\r\nAugust, and which reflect the aspirations of the region. In\r\nthis vein, and only by way of reference in view of the\r\nimportance of each and every one of its results, we should\r\nlike to refer to the way in which the text addresses the\r\nquestion of variables in the composition of the family and\r\nthe widespread concern about how poverty affects the\r\nfamily structure.\r\nWe should bear in mind that families, particularly\r\nthose living in marginal urban and rural areas, are involved\r\nin new forms of survival, including in many cases, self-\r\nmanaging organizations which permit them in solidarity to\r\ntackle the economic crisis while playing a leading role in\r\nthe process of change in society.\r\nWith regard to social commitment, despite the difficult\r\neconomic situation, and notwithstanding the scarcity of\r\nresources, Governments in many of our countries have\r\nstriven to focus their attention on families beset by the\r\nproblems of poverty, particularly those in extreme poverty,\r\nin the form of social support programmes designed to\r\nimprove their living conditions.\r\nThe basis for the recovery of the family, which is\r\nneeded for greater promotion of human rights, equality\r\nbetween the sexes, individual freedoms and greater\r\nemphasis on the rights of the child, will be determined by\r\nthe extent of international cooperation and governmental\r\nconcern.\r\nIn this respect we should like to bring forward a new\r\npoint of concern about the scope of the family. In the\r\nlast decade of the twentieth century there have been two\r\nmajor trends - the ageing of the population and the\r\ndevelopment of family structures. These trends may be\r\nregarded as different aspects of modernization and call for\r\na substantive response from Governments and from\r\nvarious members of the family.\r\nAs a result there is a need to broaden our knowledge\r\nabout the way in which changes in family and household\r\nstructures are associated with changes in the age structure\r\nof the population. In particular, we need a better\r\nunderstanding of the way in which the proportion of\r\nelderly people has grown as a result of the influences and\r\neffects that stem from economic and social change and at\r\nthe same time the influence that growth has had on those\r\nchanges.\r\nPreviously it was believed that the ageing of the\r\npopulation was a phenomenon that was particularly\r\ncharacteristic of the developed countries. However,\r\nUnited Nations forecasts indicate that the ageing of the\r\npopulation most strikingly affects the developing world,\r\nas shown by the following statistics.\r\nIn a study carried out by the Economic Commission\r\nfor Latin America and the Caribbean it was estimated that\r\nin 1980 there were more than 23 million people aged over\r\n60 in Latin America. A total of 40 million is forecast for\r\nthe year 2000, and 93 million for the year 2025. At the\r\nsame time, life expectancy at birth will rise in Latin\r\nAmerica from 51.2 years for the period 1950-1955 to 71.8\r\nyears for the period 2020-2025. This indicates that this\r\nregion cannot be considered a \"young region\", as there is\r\nan accelerated demographic transition taking place\r\ntowards lower birth and mortality rates.\r\nWe trust that in 1995 at the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women in Beijing and the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development in Copenhagen major steps\r\nforward will be taken in the process of consolidating the\r\nfamily structure.\r\nFor these reasons, on behalf of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and on behalf of my\r\ncountry I should like to reaffirm our unswerving\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\ncommitment to strengthening our efforts in order to give\r\nreality to the principle that every person has the right to\r\nform a family and that in the formation and development of\r\nthat family men and women have the same rights and\r\nduties.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on Ms. Ruth Wijdenbosch, Chairperson of the National\r\nCommittee for the Year of the Family of Suriname.\r\nMs. Wijdenbosch (Suriname): The proclamation by\r\nthe United Nations of the International Year of the Family\r\nhas offered all Governments and non-governmental\r\norganizations the opportunity to highlight the importance of\r\nthe family, increase awareness of family issues, strengthen\r\nnational efforts to respond to problems affecting the family\r\nand create greater understanding of societies for the specific\r\ndifficulties the family is facing in our rapidly changing\r\nworld.\r\nThe preparatory meetings at regional and international\r\nlevel, combined with the facilitating activities of the\r\nsecretariat of the International Year of the Family, have\r\nproduced many valuable proposals which have guided\r\nnational committees in formulating their national\r\nprogrammes. The challenge of formulating national\r\nprogrammes to support the family has been fully taken up\r\nby most States Members of the United Nations and the\r\nreports presented on the implementation of the programmes\r\nare strong testimony to the success of this undertaking.\r\nWe firmly believe that to guarantee a more successful\r\nimplementation of these programmes, a framework of\r\nconditions should be met in order to create opportunities for\r\ndevelopment, to affirm an improvement in standards of\r\nliving, and a higher quality of life for the family.\r\nThe International Year of the Family has provided us\r\nwith a unique opportunity to give human development in all\r\nits aspects the high priority it deserves in the context of the\r\nrecently held International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment and the forthcoming World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, and Fourth World Conference on Women to\r\nbe held in Beijing. These meetings give the international\r\ncommunity the opportunity adequately to address the\r\nproblems of poverty, unemployment, disintegration and\r\ndisease and how they affect the family. Taking the\r\naforementioned into consideration, we are happy to note\r\nthat there is a general understanding among the members\r\nof the international community on the relationship\r\nbetween conditions for development and the well-being of\r\nthe family.\r\nThe interrelationship between the position of the\r\nfamily, sustained economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment has been the leading approach in the\r\nformulation and implementation of the national\r\nprogramme of Suriname. This is reflected in the theme\r\nchosen for the International Year of the Family by the\r\nnational committee, namely, \"The Family in Changing\r\nSocio-economic Circumstances\".\r\nThe Suriname National Committee, which was\r\nestablished in June 1993 by the Minister for Social\r\nAffairs and Housing, attributes high priority to the social\r\nand human dimensions of development. We are aware of\r\nthe fact that, by placing the human being in the centre, a\r\nvital contribution can be made towards our common goal\r\nof achieving sustainable human development. Therefore\r\nwe support the integration of programmes to promote the\r\ndevelopment of the family into overall social and\r\neconomic development planning. The concept that social\r\nand family issues are a secondary matter in contrast with\r\nthe primary process taking place in the political forums,\r\nis a serious mistake.\r\nThe history of Suriname and the multi-ethnic\r\ncomposition of its population have resulted in a variety of\r\nfamily structures. Therefore, the Government has given\r\ndue consideration to the specific social, economic and\r\ncultural priorities and needs of the various family types\r\nand their individual members. In Suriname we\r\ndistinguish the following family structures: the nuclear\r\nfamily, a two-generation family which can be seen in our\r\nsociety in many variations such as the two-parent family,\r\nthe step-family and the adoption family; the extended\r\nfamily, the most common variations of which are the two-\r\nand three-generation families; the reorganized family; and\r\nthe single-parent family.\r\nPlease allow me briefly to explain the difficulties the\r\nsingle-parent family is confronted with in my country.\r\nThe single-parent family, in most cases with a woman at\r\nits head, can be found in the capital as well as in the rural\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nareas. In Suriname, 25 per cent of the working women are\r\nalso head of the family, and the number is increasing as a\r\nresult of the economic crisis my country is going through.\r\nStudies have shown that the majority of these women have\r\na low education level and, therefore, exercise the lowest\r\npaid professions. At the same time, they suffer the most\r\nfrom the economic crisis, which compels them to use\r\nsurvival strategies, such as looking for additional income,\r\nadjusting the expenditure of their income by saving on food\r\nand other basic needs, and by involving their children in\r\nincome-generating activities to increase the family income.\r\nThe Government of Suriname is fully aware of the\r\nsituation of this specific group and has therefore committed\r\nitself, in accordance with the Programme of Action of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nto give special attention and assistance to needy\r\nsingle-parent families through ensuring credit and funding\r\nfor women’s self-help groups. Furthermore, the\r\nGovernment also guarantees elementary services in the\r\nfields of health, education and housing for this vulnerable\r\ngroup.\r\nLet me now turn briefly to the activities carried out by\r\nthe Suriname National Committee. The Committee, which\r\nis chaired by the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly\r\nof Suriname, consists of 14 representatives of ministries and\r\nreligious and non-governmental organizations. The\r\nGovernment of Suriname fully supports the Committee and\r\nunderlines the importance of the role of the family in our\r\nsociety. The Suriname Committee has decided that its role\r\nis not to implement a programme of activities or launch a\r\nset of new initiatives on its own, but rather to increase\r\nawareness of family issues all over the country and to\r\nencourage organizations to respond to the problems and\r\nneeds of the family, and to offer technical and financial\r\nsupport to do so.\r\nIn this respect, the Committee, at the beginning of the\r\nyear, brought together a variety of organizations active in\r\nthe field of strengthening the role of the family, which\r\nidentified 28 projects in the areas of health care, food\r\nproduction, education, youth, the advancement of women,\r\nand research and data collection. Some of these projects\r\nhave already been implemented, while some will be\r\nexecuted in 1995. The United Nations Children’s Fund\r\nselected and is in the process of financing three of these\r\nprojects: the recruitment of foster families, a health\r\nproject in a number of Amerindian villages and a school\r\ngarden project which teaches children how to till the land.\r\nOther projects were financed by several local funding\r\nagencies, the private sector and the Government.\r\nThe Suriname Committee is of the view that the\r\nissues of gender equity, equality and the empowerment of\r\nwomen constitute the basic pillars of the family\r\nprogrammes and that they can facilitate the efforts to\r\nachieve the common goal of sustainable development.\r\nFor this reason, the role of women in the national\r\nprogramme for the family has been underlined.\r\nWe are committed to the process of integrating the\r\nprogramme of action for the family in our national\r\ndevelopment programme, taking into account the strong\r\nlinks between the well-being of the family and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. In this regard, the Committee is in the\r\nprocess of preparing a recommendation to the\r\nGovernment to establish a national institute for the family,\r\nwhich will act as a coordinating body for all present and\r\nfuture policies and activities of governmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations involved with issues\r\nregarding the family and development. We are of the\r\nfirm belief that this activity in the sphere of institutional\r\nstrengthening, when combined with activities in the field\r\nof research and data collection, and with the necessary\r\ninternational support of organizations such as the United\r\nNations Population Fund and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, will have a positive impact on\r\nthe Surinamese family.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank the Organization\r\nfor the praiseworthy initiative of organizing this\r\nConference, thus enabling national committees to\r\nexchange experiences and discuss follow-up activities on\r\nan issue of such great importance for all our countries and\r\npeoples.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\nnext on the representative of the Russian Federation, Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Ludmilla Bezlepkina, Minister for Social\r\nProtection.\r\nMrs. Bezlepkina (Russian Federation)\r\n(interpretation from Russian): I am greatly honoured to\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\naddress the Assembly on the question of the family. The\r\nRussian Federation is a strong supporter of the ideals and\r\nprinciples of the International Year of the Family; we base\r\nour family policy on the permanent and unchanging value\r\nof the family for the life and development of the individual\r\nand on its importance to society in terms of raising new\r\ngenerations, achieving social stability and progress, and\r\nsupporting social peace and harmony.\r\nOn that basis, the Russian Federation attaches great\r\nimportance to this question, which the General Assembly is\r\nrightly discussing. We greatly appreciate the efforts of\r\nUnited Nations experts in carrying out the activities of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. We convey special thanks\r\nto Mr. Henryk Sakolski, whose participation in the work of\r\nthe International Scientific and Practical Conference on the\r\nFamily and the Development Process, held at Moscow in\r\nNovember 1993, enhanced the importance of that\r\nConference. The report of the Conference was published\r\nin an edition of 1,500 copies and has been useful to a large\r\nnumber of scientists and practical workers.\r\nI believe that today it is not all that important to take\r\nstock of what has been done this year, the International\r\nYear of the Family. Russia has submitted to today’s\r\nConference on the question of the family a brief report\r\nentitled \"Policy Relating to the Family and the Holding of\r\nthe International Year of the Family in the Russian\r\nFederation\". Those wishing to do so are welcome to\r\nfamiliarize themselves with it. We will be able to discuss\r\nthe results of the International Year of the Family at the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. I can state with\r\nfull confidence that the activities carried out at the federal\r\nlevel and also at the regional and local levels met with\r\nbroad support and approval on the part of both the local\r\nauthorities and the population, and helped to achieve social\r\npeace and harmony even in the very complex and\r\ncontradictory times of this transitional period in the social\r\nand economic development of Russia.\r\nToday I should like to draw attention to world-wide\r\ntrends whose emergence at the national level is causing\r\ngreat concern. I refer to the reduction in the level at which\r\nthe family, as a social institution, can provide its members\r\nwith social and physical security. The factors at work here\r\nare the growth of poverty, violence, the number of orphans,\r\nloneliness, drug addiction, prostitution and alcoholism.\r\nThese are all characteristics of our times. Above all, we\r\nshould be concerned about protecting the interests and the\r\nrights of children, who are totally dependent on the\r\ndecisions and actions of adults; but their future will\r\ndepend on what those decisions and actions are.\r\nThe interests of the family are not taken into account\r\nin determining the processes of historical development.\r\nAs a consequence, families frequently do not manage to\r\nadapt to social changes. Society as a whole pays a very\r\nhigh social price for this. Have we really been creating\r\nand are we still creating systems and structural institutions\r\nthat are equal to the continuing processes of\r\nindustrialization, urbanization, the emancipation of women\r\nand the shift of productive activity outside the family\r\nstructures that create and promote conditions for the\r\nfamily to carry out its main functions? The family, as a\r\nfundamental intermediary between the individual, the\r\nState and other social institutions, is not being given by\r\nsenior officials and management organs its proper role,\r\nand sometimes the interests of the family are simply\r\nignored.\r\nThe next point is that the interests of the family are\r\nnot taken into account in the determination of the\r\ninterrelationship between employer and employee. The\r\nlatter is frequently considered as a work resource, but not\r\nas a worker with family obligations. If we correlate this\r\nto the objective reality which is characteristic of Russia\r\nand, indeed, for many other countries, where both parents\r\nin the family are working, this on the one hand is\r\nprogressive from the point of view of equal opportunity\r\nfor men and women, but it also requires the adoption of\r\nan appropriate policy regarding the responsibility of both\r\nparents in bringing up the children and caring for the sick\r\nand the elderly, a policy of equalizing intra-family\r\nrelations. The State, for its part, must actively help to\r\ndevelop a system of social services and their provision\r\nand assure the right and opportunity for their use, as well\r\nas the corresponding regimes and guarantees of\r\nemployment.\r\nOnly through such an approach can we talk about\r\nreal ways of achieving the rights and freedoms of the\r\nindividual on the principle of the elimination of all forms\r\nof discrimination, particularly discrimination against\r\nwomen. Only such an approach can ensure greater\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nparticipation and the corresponding greater responsibility of\r\nwomen, involving them in the management of resources\r\nand in taking decisions at all social levels.\r\nToday we cannot but see the need for a high level of\r\ncoordination in the role of the United Nations and effective\r\naction at the interregional level, particularly for the\r\ncountries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.\r\nRecognizing the high degree of importance of social law as\r\na basis for achieving economic and political cooperation for\r\nsustainable development, I feel it necessary and important\r\nto strengthen the role of cooperation at the regional level,\r\nin this case, the role of the Economic Commission for\r\nEurope.\r\nOn the basis of the above, and given the importance\r\nof the efforts and initiatives of the United Nations and\r\nUNICEF in the interests of our children, and of\r\nforthcoming events in the area of social policy - the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, to be held in March 1995,\r\nand the Fourth World Conference on Women in September\r\n1995 - I am proposing that we declare the period 1995-\r\n2005 the Decade of the Family. I propose that we work\r\nout a plan of action for this decade that takes into account\r\nthe reality of achieving evolutionary development and\r\nprogress, and that defines measures and standards for\r\nprotecting the fundamental functions of the family and their\r\ndevelopment and adaptation to the new realities and\r\nchallenges of life.\r\nThe experience of the past decade in improving the\r\nstatus of women and the disabled confirms the rightness of\r\nsuch an approach. Our common efforts at the international\r\nand national levels will help us move into the twenty-first\r\ncentury on the basis of the principles of real priority\r\ninterests of the individual and spiritual and moral\r\ndevelopment which to a great extent, is assisted by the\r\nfamily. This is a phenomenon of the progress of the\r\nevolutionary development of society and of the individual,\r\nwho is able to react to the challenges of life on the strength\r\nof the principles and ethics of his or her lofty human\r\npotential. Achieving this must be the goal of the further\r\nhistorical development of the family’s economic, political\r\nand social transformations.\r\nAllow me to wish all the participants in the General\r\nAssembly every success in achieving these noble goals.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Pawan Kumar Bansal,\r\nMember of Parliament of India.\r\nMr. Pawan Kumar Bansal (India): It is most\r\nappropriate that we should be celebrating the International\r\nYear of the Family this year and addressing related issues\r\nin the General Assembly. The International Conference\r\non Population and Development, held recently in Cairo,\r\nprovides the backdrop for our deliberations.\r\nIndia believes that the family is the basic building-\r\nblock of society. Good family values have been able to\r\ncontain tension, conflict, crime and violence in society,\r\nparticularly in the young, and have protected to a large\r\ndegree the rights and safety of children, engendered social\r\ncompact and responsibility, and directly contributed to the\r\ninternal peace, growth, stability and harmony of society.\r\nIt is of paramount importance that United Nations\r\nactivities on human rights education should draw upon the\r\nbest of successful family traditions and values from all\r\nsocieties and promote them around the globe in the\r\ninterest of more peaceful societies, and the preservation\r\nof human rights and social values for all mankind.\r\nIndividuals have not only rights in society, but\r\nresponsibilities to society as well, and to the global family\r\nas a whole, as is reflected in the ancient Indian concept\r\nof \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbhakam\", that is, the world is but\r\na family.\r\nIndia has been implementing active and holistic\r\nfamily-welfare strategies over several decades with\r\npositive results. This is based upon the interconnections\r\nof literacy, economic and social development and\r\npopulation control. In India, the family has been the\r\nbasic unit of stability and integration in a society of free\r\nchoice. Indian family-welfare programmes are\r\nsignificantly based on voluntary participation.\r\nThe Indian Government spends about half a billion\r\ndollars annually on its family welfare programme. India’s\r\nfamily welfare programme is funded by the central\r\nGovernment. In an effort to impart dynamism to our\r\nfamily-welfare programme, a focused and result-oriented\r\naction plan has been developed over the last few years.\r\nSome of its key features are: improving the quality and\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\noutreach of family-welfare services; developing a\r\nmechanism to make funds available to the state\r\ngovernments on the basis of their performance in the\r\nreduction of the birth rate; increasing the coverage of\r\nyounger couples; involving voluntary and non-governmental\r\norganizations in a big way to promote active community\r\nparticipation; and evolving higher-level intersectoral\r\ncoordination mechanisms at the national, state, district and\r\nblock levels and, most important, at the village level.\r\nIndia fully accepts the goal of universalizing services\r\nfor sexual and reproductive health care, of meeting the\r\nunmet needs by the year 2015, as envisaged at Cairo, and\r\nof removing all programme-related barriers by 2005. We\r\naim to implement the Cairo Programme of Action at the\r\nnational level, with international cooperation as appropriate\r\nand in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\r\nHowever, India expressed reservations on the linking of\r\ndebt relief with government investment in family and\r\ndevelopment programmes at the Conference on Population\r\nand Development in Cairo, since we believe that the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the Cairo\r\nConference on the subject of the family and population is\r\nthe sovereign right of a State, in consonance with its\r\nnational laws and development priorities.\r\nIn India, we have also realized that development\r\nactivities undertaken with the active participation of the\r\nbeneficiaries and the community have a greater chance of\r\nsuccess and can be more cost effective. India has benefited\r\nfrom the rich tradition of voluntary action from the\r\nbeginning of our independence movement under Mahatma\r\nGandhi, and today voluntary and non-governmental groups\r\nplay an important and supportive role along with the\r\nGovernment in development activities, including those\r\nconcerning the welfare of women, particularly at the grass\r\nroots.\r\nIn India, the term \"weaker sections\" embraces the\r\nsocially and economically disadvantaged sections of our\r\npopulation. The Constitution of India recognizes the\r\nspecial needs of these specific groups and makes a number\r\nof provisions to protect and promote their interests. It is in\r\nthis tradition that the constitutional provision on the\r\ndirective principles of State policy has informed the policy-\r\nmaking of successive Governments in India in order to\r\nensure social justice for all. The disadvantaged sections\r\nconstitute about 25 per cent of the population. Their\r\ndevelopment is being pursued through some of the largest\r\naffirmative-action programmes in the world in their\r\nfavour in education, employment and other areas. The\r\nGovernment has also involved non-governmental\r\norganizations in the promotion of the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of the weaker sections.\r\nThe disabled constitute about 1.9 per cent of our\r\npopulation. Today, special emphasis is placed by the\r\nGovernment on rehabilitation programmes for slum\r\ndwellers, comprehensive legislation for the rights of\r\npeople with disabilities, and wider education of the\r\ndisabled. A national programme for developing\r\ntechnologies for the disabled was launched in 1988. We\r\nhave also set up special employment exchanges and\r\nspecial cells for handicapped persons all over the country.\r\nThe Integrated Rural Development Programme and\r\nthe Prime Minister’s New Employment Scheme support\r\ntraining programmes for youth towards self-employment\r\nin all Indian states. These programmes provide technical\r\nand basic managerial skills as well as loans and subsidies\r\nto youth in the age group of 18 to 35 years and to\r\nfamilies living below the poverty line, to enable them to\r\nbecome self-employed.\r\nIndia has registered considerable success in the\r\nfunctioning and development of the cooperative\r\nmovement in a democratic society. This is acknowledged\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report on the subject in\r\ndocument A/49/213. We endorse some of the conclusions\r\nof the report: First, cooperative enterprises provide the\r\norganizational means by which a significant proportion of\r\nhumanity is able to take into its own hands the tasks of\r\ncreating productive employment, overcoming poverty and\r\nachieving social integration. Secondly, cooperatives\r\ncontribute substantially to the common good in market\r\neconomies, principally by improving the efficiency and\r\nquality of the economy, but also by assuring\r\ndemocratization and environmental rationality. Thirdly,\r\nan effective working partnership between Governments\r\nand cooperative movements might be an important means\r\nto allocate and mobilize societal resources effectively.\r\nOther conclusions of the report need further study.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nJust as the needs of the family, youth, women and the\r\naged are best met in a just, democratic and tolerant society,\r\ncohesive, well-knit family traditions, in turn, contribute to\r\nthe building of such a society. The societies which have\r\noverlooked the importance of traditional family values in\r\ntheir pursuit of personal excellence and prosperity are today\r\nre-emphasizing the role of the individual within the family.\r\nIn this International Year of the Family, let us reaffirm our\r\nfaith in the family as the nucleus of a healthy and orderly\r\nsociety.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Malta, Mr. Joseph Cassar.\r\nMr. Cassar (Malta): These Meetings of the General\r\nAssembly are significant not only because they coincide\r\nwith the observance of the International Year of the Family,\r\nbut also, and even more, because they reflect the\r\nimportance Member States ascribe to the family.\r\nThroughout history, the family has always been\r\nconsidered the basic unit of society. The International\r\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo again\r\nacknowledged and reaffirmed this fact. Malta is honoured\r\nto have contributed to the negotiations which ensured that\r\nthis principle was given the attention it merits in the\r\nConference’s final document.\r\nThe family is an essential element for secure social\r\ndevelopment. It provides a source of mutual love, respect,\r\nsolidarity and affection and acts as a support system for its\r\nindividual members, encouraging personal growth and\r\nrespect for individual rights.\r\nThe family transmits values from one generation to\r\nanother and is a powerful agent for social, political and\r\ncultural evolution - a primary vehicle for development,\r\nindustrialization and urbanization. The family, however, is\r\nalso influenced by the nature and pace of change. It is\r\ntoday subject to numerous pressures that make it extremely\r\nvulnerable and thus it requires, more than ever before, the\r\nsupport of other institutions.\r\nThe international community’s celebration of the\r\nInternational Year of the Family is a long-overdue\r\nacknowledgement. In preparation for this International\r\nYear of the Family, Malta had the privilege of hosting the\r\nUnited Nations Europe and North America Preparatory\r\nMeeting in April 1993 and the World NGO Forum in\r\nNovember 1993. The Valletta Declaration issued by the\r\nEurope and North America Preparatory Meeting\r\nreaffirmed a wide-ranging commitment to the family and\r\ninvited the United Nations, intergovernmental\r\norganizations and Member States to encourage and\r\nsupport regional cooperation with respect to family\r\nmatters.\r\nMalta has noted with great interest, and supports, the\r\nrecommendations of the Coordinator of the International\r\nYear of the Family calling for appropriate action to be\r\ntaken with a view to including family-oriented elements\r\nin the work of the Commission on Human Rights. By\r\nsafeguarding and promoting the values and unity of the\r\nfamily, we further strengthen the protection of human\r\nrights.\r\nThe Government of Malta believes that the State\r\nshould concern itself with helping and consolidating the\r\nfamily. It can never be in the true interest of the State to\r\nweaken the family unit. The State should support and\r\nprotect the family and facilitate its role. Such a role\r\nrequires the safeguarding of human rights, ranging from\r\nthe equal rights of men and women to social security;\r\nfrom the right to education to the right to life of the\r\nunborn child.\r\nIn giving its support, the State should not exploit the\r\nfamily in order to ensure a larger or smaller work force.\r\nParents have the exclusive right to plan the size of their\r\nfamily in accordance with their own beliefs and\r\nconvictions. Decisions of this nature should not be made\r\nunder pressure by the State through such methods as\r\nlimiting the number of children eligible for State\r\nsubsidies.\r\nSince Malta’s independence 30 years ago, successive\r\nGovernments in Malta have worked to give tangible form\r\nto these convictions. The enactment of Act XXI of 1993\r\nby Parliament, after weeks of public discussion, has given\r\na new dimension to family life. The law provides for a\r\nconcept of marriage based on the recognition of the\r\nfundamental principles of equality between the spouses\r\nand, necessarily, on their common consent. In marriage\r\nand within the family, husband and wife are recognized,\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nin practice and in the eyes of the law, to be equal partners.\r\nThey are jointly responsible for the care and upbringing of\r\nthe children and are expected to reach agreement on all\r\nmatters of importance to family life. The status of women\r\nhas been enhanced through fundamental changes that give\r\nthe necessary recognition to the dignity of the person - a\r\ndignity shared by all individual members of the family.\r\nThe Government of Malta believes that discrimination\r\non the basis of gender should be eliminated in a democratic\r\nsociety. Women should not be discriminated against. They\r\nshould have the right to decide to work outside the home\r\nand have the right to the same remuneration as their male\r\ncounterparts. The acknowledgement of such rights in no\r\nway diminishes the important and significant contribution\r\nto society of women who choose to exercise their right to\r\ndevote all of their time to bringing up their children and\r\nlooking after the family. For such choices to be truly free,\r\nStates should promote child day-care services, subsidies for\r\nfull-time family workers, and retraining opportunities for\r\nwomen who rejoin the work force after an absence of some\r\nyears.\r\nMy Government believes that the family offers the\r\nbest psychological milieu for stable personality\r\ndevelopment, as well as the niche where one assimilates\r\nmoral values and cherished social customs. The family\r\noffers its members the basis of a satisfactory and\r\nmeaningful life. Above all, it provides solidarity to all its\r\nmembers, particularly those with special needs owing to\r\ndisability, emotional stress or ageing. In this respect, the\r\nfamily, given the necessary support by Government and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, is the ideal organ for\r\nenhancing the chances for persons, whatever their special\r\nneeds, to remain integrated in society.\r\nIn the light of these principles, the Government of\r\nMalta strives to support the family rather than to supplant\r\nit. Social security is universal, and assistance is provided\r\nto the unemployed and to persons without any source of\r\nincome. Children’s and family allowances are granted by\r\nthe State, and special benefits are available for the\r\nchronically ill, the disabled and other marginal groups. An\r\nallowance is given to persons who give up employment to\r\ncare for a disabled or an elderly relative. Pensions for the\r\nelderly and the disabled provide adequate financial income\r\nto ensure integration. These benefits, together with\r\nuniversal health care, help foster solidarity and diminish\r\nthat stress which persons with special needs exert on the\r\nfamily.\r\nProtection and assistance help the family to fully\r\nassume its responsibility as the basic unit of society. As\r\nthe natural environment for children and youth, and the\r\nmost desirable support system for the elderly and the\r\ndisabled, the strengthening of the family should be given\r\npriority by national Governments, intergovernmental\r\norganizations and concerned non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nIn recent years, the family and social change have\r\nbeen the subject of considerable discussion in Malta. The\r\nfamily has become smaller but remains strong and\r\nstrategic in the social structure of our community. Its\r\nstrength has helped it evolve and respond to various\r\neconomic, social and psychological pressures. The\r\nGovernment and non-governmental organizations, in\r\nsupporting the family, emphasize preventive measures\r\nsuch as counselling before and during marriage. In cases\r\nof marital breakdown, hostel facilities and accommodation\r\nat affordable rents are provided whenever possible.\r\nResidential facilities are available for children taken in\r\ncare, but in this respect fostering is preferred to long-term\r\ninstitutionalization.\r\nDuring the past 30 years, economic development and\r\nthe increasing level of employment have been\r\ninstrumental in raising the standard of living. This\r\nprocess has been further strengthened by free and\r\nuniversal access to education at all levels.\r\nDrug abuse is a cause of concern. The welfare\r\nservices, in close cooperation with the health authorities,\r\nthe police and the Catholic non-governmental organization\r\nCaritas, provide comprehensive counselling, detoxification\r\nservices and programmes aimed at overcoming the\r\nproblem and encouraging full integration.\r\nIn major international instruments, the United\r\nNations and the international community have proclaimed\r\nthe inalienable and fundamental human rights of persons\r\nand have repeatedly declared that the family, as the basic\r\nunit of society, is entitled to protection by society and the\r\nState. These abundant references to the family should be\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nembodied in a coherent and comprehensive document on\r\nthe functions, responsibilities and rights of the family.\r\nSuch an international document on the family would have\r\na direct impact on its members and on the role of the\r\nfamily in society. It would further rather than preclude the\r\nprotection of the rights of the family and of its individual\r\nmembers.\r\nThat is why my Government believes that in the\r\nfollow-up to this Year of the Family, we should harmonize\r\nour efforts to consolidate peace and democracy with efforts\r\nto promote social justice on a global scale. Families can\r\nrealize their full potential only in a world where peace and\r\nfreedom prevail and in a just society free from inequities.\r\nPoverty, hunger, illiteracy, racial discrimination, the\r\ndegradation of the environment, armed conflict and other\r\ncalamities greatly impede the normal development of the\r\nfamily in vast areas of the world.\r\nPolitical and economic instability have uprooted\r\nmillions from their homes. In a spirit of international\r\nsolidarity, many States have welcomed the victims of these\r\nmodern-day scourges. It is hoped that in such instances\r\nfamily reunification will be given the importance it\r\ndeserves.\r\nSubsidiarity is a key principle of contemporary\r\nsociety. Our efforts to bring decision-making close to those\r\nmost affected by it should find immediate resonance in\r\nmatters which have a direct impact on the family.\r\nBelieving as we do that the family is the basic unit of\r\nsociety, we should strive to fortify its protection and\r\nsupport. The erosion of the family as an institution cannot\r\nbut result in fissures which threaten the stability of those\r\nvery societies which we cherish most.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I should\r\nlike to inform the Assembly that the representative of\r\nBrazil has requested to be allowed to participate in the\r\ndebate on this agenda item, although the list of speakers\r\nwas closed yesterday morning.\r\nIf there is no objection, I shall take it that the\r\nAssembly decides to allow the name of the delegation of\r\nBrazil to be included in the list of speakers.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Deputy Permanent Representative of Japan,\r\nMr. Shunji Maruyama.\r\nMr. Maruyama (Japan): Before commencing my\r\nremarks, I would like to express my appreciation to Mr.\r\nHenryk J. Sokalski, Coordinator for the International Year\r\nof the Family, for his excellent work in promoting\r\nobservance of the Year.\r\nIt is universally recognized that the family\r\nconstitutes the basic unit of society and that it assumes\r\ndiverse forms and functions which reflect the diversity of\r\nindividual preferences and social conditions. It acts as a\r\nleading agent in promoting the well-being of the larger\r\nsocial entities that are built on it, and it thus plays a\r\ncritical role in social development. Everywhere, the\r\nfamily provides both physical and spiritual support for its\r\nmembers, and particularly for those who are most\r\nvulnerable, such as children, working adults, and the\r\naged. Our common principles and values - human\r\ndignity, equality, respect, mutual responsibility and\r\ncooperation - are first shaped and nurtured in the family.\r\nBearing all this in mind, the Government of Japan is\r\nin full accord with the objectives of the International Year\r\nof the Family, which provides Member States with an\r\nexcellent opportunity to re-evaluate and promote the\r\nfamily’s unique role and functions in various aspects of\r\nour life. The Year is an occasion to promote the concept\r\nof the family as the smallest working democracy, one that\r\noperates at the very heart of society.\r\nJapan welcomes the vast array of initiatives\r\nundertaken by Member States in support of families, and,\r\nfor its part, it is carrying out a number of public-\r\ninformation activities in observance of the Year. Among\r\nthe events organized by the Government of Japan are\r\nseminars and concerts, and the issuance of special\r\ncommemorative stamps. Local governments and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations are also making important\r\ncontributions in promoting the role and functions of the\r\nfamily in bringing about social progress.\r\nThese activities help the people understand the\r\nobjectives of the International Year of the Family, one of\r\nwhich is the creation of a society of equals that gives\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nspecial priorities to the needs of the vulnerable. My\r\ncountry attaches particular importance to promoting policies\r\nand measures that contribute to a more equal partnership\r\nbetween men and women and, in particular, an equal\r\nsharing of family responsibilities. This is especially\r\nimportant in the light of the trend towards smaller families\r\nin Japan, which often diminishes the ability of the basic\r\nsocial group to care for its members, particularly children,\r\nthe disabled and the elderly. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to announce that in April of this\r\ncommemorative Year Japan ratified the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child as part of its effort to address such\r\nconcerns.\r\nThis series of plenary meetings of the General\r\nAssembly has given us an invaluable opportunity to\r\nfamiliarize ourselves with the various policies and\r\nprogrammes being adopted and executed by other Member\r\nStates. The many examples we have heard of the success\r\nof these efforts spur us to make further efforts of our own.\r\nMy delegation believes that in following up the Year we\r\nshould pay greater attention to the family in the national\r\npolicies we formulate. It is imperative that our policies be\r\nbased on respect for the individual, rather than focusing on\r\nthe family as a whole.\r\nThe pivotal role of the family in the development\r\nprocess will be a key issue at the upcoming World Summit\r\nfor Social Development and the Fourth World Conference\r\non Women. These high-level forums can make an\r\ninvaluable contribution to ensuring the success of the Year\r\nand an effective follow-up to it. As we come to the end of\r\nthe International Year of the Family we should remain\r\nactive in promoting the inherent strength of the family and\r\nin strengthening its role and functions in contributing to\r\nnational, regional, and international sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMrs. Sirelkhtim (Sudan), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Arabic): I now\r\ncall on the Permanent Representative of the Netherlands,\r\nMr. N. H. Beigman.\r\nMr. Biegman (Netherlands): In the Netherlands, the\r\nworking definition of a family is \"a living unit in which the\r\ncare and the upbringing of the child takes place\". We\r\nattach great importance to the breadth of this definition\r\nand to the concept of \"living unit\". Government policies\r\nand specific measures may affect these living units, but\r\nthey are not focused on or geared to families as such.\r\nThey focus on the individual citizens, and particularly the\r\nchildren, belonging to the families, or the living units.\r\nAs has been stated on earlier occasions, the\r\nGovernment of the Netherlands, because of this national\r\npolicy, was at first somewhat reluctant to accept the idea\r\nof an International Year of the Family. However, the\r\nNetherlands Government ultimately decided to join in the\r\npreparations, and it established an independent National\r\nCommittee provided with a substantial Government\r\nsubsidy and corporate sponsorship.\r\nSpecial attention has been given to a number of\r\nactivities and projects in fields such as living units in\r\nwhich there are young children, focusing on people in\r\nsocially deprived conditions and people in \"special\"\r\ncircumstances; assisting migrant living units in the\r\nprocess of integration into Netherlands society, using\r\nspecially designed methods to educate very young\r\nchildren and their mothers; enhancing the equality of the\r\nvarious living units in the Netherlands, based on cultural,\r\nreligious and personal preferences; and finally,\r\nconsciousness-raising, in particular raising the\r\nconsciousness of fathers.\r\nHence, after this somewhat hesitant start, the year of\r\nthe family in the Netherlands has provided a basis for\r\nsocially relevant activities and projects. The Netherlands\r\nNational Committee participated actively in the closing\r\nconference of the International Year of the Family in\r\nMontreal last week, with a view to fostering acceptance\r\nand recognition of alternative family arrangements. Two\r\ninternational congresses, in October and November, will\r\nsupplement this development, one on \"Children on the\r\nMove\", dealing with the situation of abducted, adopted\r\nand refugee children, the other with single-parent families.\r\nPlease allow me to explain, briefly, the Netherlands’\r\nposition and to elucidate what we consider to be \"a\r\nfamily\". The family concept as such generally implies a\r\nvariety of notions. While the Netherlands recognizes the\r\nfamily as a basic unit of society, we also recognize the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\ndiversity of family life, lifestyles and structures within and\r\nbetween societies. This diversity has been confirmed by\r\nfindings of the World Economic Survey, which states that\r\nat present about 35 per cent of all households worldwide\r\nare run by women. Government policy in the Netherlands\r\nis therefore geared to individuals in all their various\r\nsituations. This includes families, comparable social units\r\nand those who do not live in a family. We wish to\r\nunderline that in our society, apart from the traditional\r\nfamily comprising a married father and mother and their\r\nchildren, other forms of living together also exist: for\r\nexample, single-parent units - mostly only a mother with\r\nher children - and unmarried individuals who live together,\r\nof opposite sexes or of the same sex.\r\nIn our opinion, it is not for a government to hand\r\ndown a judgement regarding these various forms of living\r\ntogether. The government should focus on the upbringing\r\nand education of children. In our opinion, children should\r\nbe the focus of our attention, whether they are living at\r\nhome or have left home but remain dependent - for\r\nexample those who, because of their studies or for various\r\nother reasons, are temporarily away from home - or, of\r\ncourse, are homeless. Because its policy is focused on\r\nchildren rather than on the family as such, the Netherlands\r\ndoes not have anything like a family policy, which makes\r\nit difficult for us to go along with international positions\r\nregarding such policies. They just do not apply to the\r\nsituation in the Netherlands.\r\nIn a worldwide context, family structures, traditions\r\nand values differ so markedly that it seems unlikely that\r\ninternational consultations on family matters could result in\r\nwidely applicable international measures to strengthen\r\nfamily life. The Netherlands Government is concerned that\r\na debate at the global level could become value-laden and\r\nmight specifically be used to promote negative views about,\r\nor even bias and discrimination against, types of households\r\nother than the traditional nuclear family.\r\nIn closing, let me stress that we feel very strongly that\r\nattention to families in all their varieties should never lead\r\nto diminished attention to the rights of the individual. In\r\nthe end, all living units are composed of individuals, and it\r\nis respect for the rights and dignity of the individual that\r\ncan promote greater understanding between people, nations\r\nand cultures.\r\nThe President: (interpretation from Arabic): I now\r\ncall on Mr. José Bernard Pallais Arana, the Vice Minister\r\nfor Foreign Relations of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Pallais Arana (Nicaragua) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The staggering changes taking place on the\r\ninternational scene affect the scope of relations between\r\nStates themselves as well as relationships among social\r\ngroups, which within those societies have their separate\r\nidentities, lifestyles and cultures. The family, commonly\r\nregarded as the basic unit of society and the focus of the\r\nsocial organization network, is undergoing a rapid process\r\nof change, which in some societies is affecting the very\r\nconcept of the family. The Cairo Conference reaffirmed\r\nthe concept of the family as a natural and fundamental\r\nnucleus of society.\r\nThe acute needs stemming from the demands of\r\ndevelopment, economic growth, structural adjustments and\r\nextreme poverty have all had an effect on the structure of\r\nthe family, leading to the mass incorporation of women\r\ninto the labour market, changing the relations between the\r\nsexes, thereby having an impact on the size of families\r\nand giving rise to an increase in early motherhood and the\r\nbreakdown of marriages. In countries where conflicts\r\nhave taken on a dimension of social violence, families\r\nhave been affected by forced separation, displacement and\r\nfamily disintegration. In all these cases children are\r\naffected the most.\r\nOur country took an active part in the regional Latin\r\nAmerican-Caribbean preparatory meeting for the\r\nInternational Year of the Family, organized by the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC), and on that occasion we adopted the\r\nCartagena Declaration and the regional proposal for the\r\npreparation of courses of action to assist the families of\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\r\nThat Declaration recognized the complex processes\r\nof change taking place in the institution of the family in\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean; the close relationships\r\nbetween the family and the processes of democratization\r\nand peace; the importance that cooperation among the\r\ncountries of the region and support from international\r\nagencies and non-governmental organizations has for the\r\npolicies, plans and programmes in support of families.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nWe are certain that the agreements reflected in that\r\nDeclaration and in the regional proposal will help to\r\nstrengthen the family as a leading actor in providing for its\r\nown well-being; will promote its integration in relations of\r\nequity, solidarity, cooperation, affection and respect; and\r\nwill foster broad-ranging and responsible concerted action\r\nbetween the Government and society for the overall benefit\r\nof the family.\r\nIn the governmental programme outlined by Her\r\nExcellency President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, there is\r\na clear statement of political resolve to direct resources to\r\nthe full ethical, economic and social recovery of the\r\nNicaraguan nuclear family, after a decade of political and\r\nmilitary conflict.\r\nThe family passes on values and rules of behaviour\r\nand plays an important role in economic, political, social\r\nand cultural aspects of society. It is the smallest social area\r\nfor interaction on a day-to-day basis and for the\r\nenhancement of the well-being of the individual.\r\nTraditionally, the Nicaraguan family has assigned\r\ndifferent roles to men and women; however, this situation\r\nhas changed as a result of socio-economic factors that have\r\narisen in recent decades and have led to growing\r\nparticipation by women in economic activity, thus leading\r\nto a redefinition of the roles of men and women.\r\nNicaragua’s political Constitution stipulates that the\r\nfamily is the fundamental nucleus of society and has a right\r\nto the protection of society and the State and to the\r\nsafeguarding of its rights. The present Constitution, and the\r\nlaws adopted under the Constitution, provide for the rights\r\nof the family.\r\nPresident Chamorro has paid particular attention to the\r\nrestoration of the moral principles and values of the\r\nNicaraguan family, to the promotion of respect within the\r\nfamily unit and, above all, to the promotion of family unity\r\nas the primary foundation of society and a fundamental\r\nfactor in national reconciliation. The Government of\r\nNicaragua is today determined to conserve such basic\r\nvalues of the Nicaraguan family as solidarity among family\r\nmembers and, above all, the family’s educational function\r\nas a transmitter of moral and civic values.\r\nIn carrying out the objectives of the International\r\nYear of the Family the Government of Nicaragua has set\r\nup a National Commission for the International Year of\r\nthe Family, with the participation of representatives from\r\nvarious State Ministries, non-governmental organizations\r\nand the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).\r\nThe social cabinet entrusted the National\r\nCommission with specific duties, including the\r\npreparation of a preliminary draft family code to\r\nconsolidate and update existing legislation, the\r\ndissemination of the goals of the International Year of the\r\nFamily at the national and international levels and the\r\nperformance of activities designed to promote family\r\nintegration in the community.\r\nThe process of curricular change being carried out\r\nby the Ministry of Education has placed special emphasis\r\non the promotion of family values as the basic axis of\r\nhuman development and democratic life. Since 1993\r\nparents have been actively participating in that Ministry’s\r\nconsultative councils and in schools and institutes at the\r\nbasic-education level.\r\nOne of the main functions of the Nicaraguan\r\nInstitute for Women is the protection of women in the\r\nfamily and society in an attempt to integrate them, on an\r\nequal footing, into the country’s economic and social\r\nrelationships, with special emphasis on the overall health\r\nof women and children.\r\nAt the same time, the programmes of the Ministry of\r\nHealth dedicated to so-called reproductive health place\r\nspecial emphasis on promoting women’s self-esteem and\r\non strengthening the family nucleus and unit. The\r\nMinistry of Health, in an effort to improve the\r\npopulation’s quality of life, has introduced profound\r\nchanges in the organization and the provision of services.\r\nManagement has been made more democratic through\r\ncommunity participation by the creation of departmental\r\nhealth councils, which have had a decisive impact on the\r\norganization of services and their effectiveness.\r\nSimilarly, the policies of the Ministry of Labour\r\nhave attempted to guarantee a minimum wage to workers\r\nfree from gender-based discrimination, in keeping with\r\nthe basic needs of the average Nicaraguan family and\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nurban and rural labour demands. The Ministry has also\r\ntried to achieve collective agreements and compacts to\r\nguarantee incentives such as accident insurance,\r\nsupplements based on seniority, maternity protection and\r\nindemnity based on seniority at the end of the labour\r\ncontract. Further, the Nicaraguan Institute for Agrarian\r\nReforms is proceeding to assign crop-land titles to families\r\nin order to promote the preservation of family heritage, thus\r\nmaintaining family unity.\r\nBut above and beyond the International Year, the\r\nfamily is the principal focus of the Chamorro Government’s\r\npolicy of national reconciliation. We believe that peace is\r\na process that must begin in the Nicaraguan family, a\r\nfamily that has been divided by a decade of wars and\r\nantagonisms of all kinds. We believe that we have taken\r\na significant step along this arduous path and that our\r\nachievements will be irreversible.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Reaz Rahman, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Bangladesh.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): Five years ago the\r\nAssembly decided to proclaim the year 1994 the\r\nInternational Year of the Family. Since then, concentrated\r\npreparatory work has been undertaken by Governments, the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat, specialized agencies, regional\r\nCommissions and intergovernmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations to give substance to the importance of the\r\nfamily and to highlight awareness of it on the part of\r\npolicy-makers and the public - the family not only as the\r\nbasic unit of social life but as a key motivator for\r\npromoting environmental supportive growth, societal justice,\r\ndemocracy and human rights at all levels of society. We\r\nwould like to pay a special tribute to President Amara Essy\r\nfor his opening address and to the Secretary-General for\r\ncomprehensively outlining the steps taken to project this\r\nissue now and in the future.\r\nIn launching the International Year of the Family and\r\ndeclaring 15 May as the annual International Day of\r\nFamilies, the international community seeks to highlight the\r\nneed for continuity in promoting implementation and\r\nfollow-up measures that will keep the basic notion of the\r\nfamily in the foreground and the family’s importance as a\r\ncrucial agent in and beneficiary of the development process\r\nand as an essential nucleus in society for generating moral\r\nand ethical values.\r\nSeveral key perceptions have emerged that are\r\ngaining widespread recognition and that need to be further\r\nencouraged and strengthened. First and foremost, there\r\nis the perception that major instruments of the United\r\nNations, be they on human rights or on the evolution of\r\nsocial policies or global programmes of action on\r\ndevelopment, are increasingly being centred on the human\r\nbeing and are, in turn, calling for the widest possible\r\nprotection and assistance to be accorded to the family.\r\nA second fundamental element is gender equality,\r\nwomen’s equal participation in employment, shared\r\nparental responsibility and the significance of the rights of\r\nchildren. Third is the recognition that, despite diversity\r\nin the various concepts of the family in different social,\r\ncultural and political systems, there are many common\r\nelements in the problems faced by families in all parts of\r\nthe world. Perhaps most important is the growing\r\nawareness, as the President of the General Assembly\r\npointed out, that\r\n\"social policies must respond to holistic, family-\r\ncentred principles.\" (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary Meeting,\r\n35th meeting, [p. 8])\r\nIndeed, the resolution adopted by the Assembly at its\r\nforty-seventh session expressed awareness that families\r\nare the fullest reflection, at the grass-roots level, of the\r\nstrengths and weaknesses of the social and developmental\r\nwelfare environment and as such offer a uniquely\r\ncomprehensive and synthesizing approach to social issues.\r\nToday, the basic challenge facing us is to bolster the\r\nposition of families as a major catalyst for social progress\r\nand development and to reinforce their role as the key\r\nnucleus for promoting moral and ethical values,\r\neducation, rights and responsibilities and the fundamental\r\nfoundation for democracy. If the impressive\r\nachievements of the International Year of the Family are\r\nto have any last effect, a crucial imperative will be to\r\nconsolidate and implement follow-up actions to the goals\r\nwe have set together.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nBangladesh has been attaching due importance to the\r\nobservance of the Year and to looking beyond it. A broad\r\narray of activities have been undertaken to celebrate it.\r\nThese include a series of constructive activities befitting\r\nfamilies across the country. Emphasis on gender equality in\r\nsociety and in the family has been an additional factor in\r\nthe creation of a greater awareness of the role of individual\r\nmembers within this the basic unit of society.\r\nA major target that has been reached is unanimous\r\nrecognition of the role of families in fostering sustained\r\ngrowth and sustainable development. Bangladesh’s\r\nDepartment of Social Services is implementing a number of\r\nprogrammes, both in urban and in rural areas, to ensure\r\nbalanced socio-economic development of families.\r\nEmphasis is being laid on both moral and material family\r\ndevelopment. The areas of this development include health,\r\nsanitation, education, the skills required for\r\nself-employment, and recreation.\r\nFamilies are truly the building-blocks of societies and\r\nthe essential fabric of human relationships. We are deeply\r\ncommitted to appropriately supporting and sustaining\r\nfamilies as the means of providing a better future for our\r\nchildren and as a fundamental social unit to strengthen the\r\nlocal community, national society and the global\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Arabic): I call on\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Liechtenstein, Mrs.\r\nClaudia Fritsche.\r\nMrs. Fritsche (Liechenstein): In the past, families\r\nhave often been defined as the \"smallest democracy at the\r\nheart of societies\". When the International Year of the\r\nFamily was being launched, it was affirmed that families as\r\nthe fundamental group units of society are entitled to\r\nmaximum protection and assistance to enable them to fulfil\r\ntheir roles in ensuring the development of their individual\r\nmembers and of society.\r\nIdeally, families are the primary source of nurturing\r\nand care. They transmit values and culture and form an\r\noasis in a competitive world. Families continue to be the\r\nprimary caring institutions. They look after members who\r\nare young or elderly, ill or disabled. It is through the\r\nfamily that children acquire the knowledge and skills that\r\nwill serve them as adults.\r\nThere is no simple view of the family, and no easy\r\ndefinition of family policy. To some degree, all policies\r\naffect families. Yet, policies and programmes tend to be\r\nbased on concepts and family models which, because of\r\nthe major changes that most societies have undergone in\r\nrecent decades, may no longer reflect reality.\r\nThe traditional forms of family are changing.\r\nImprovements in communication and access to\r\ninformation enable individual family members to have\r\nincreased contact with ideas and behavioural norms that\r\ngo beyond their traditional spheres. Economic factors\r\nforce families to separate when members migrate in\r\nsearch of employment. Within a relatively short time,\r\nextended families have shrunk, and single-parent families\r\nare no longer the exception. Today, between a quarter\r\nand a third of all households worldwide are headed by\r\nsingle parents, of whom 90 per cent are women. One of\r\nthe most demanding aspects of the daily lives of many\r\nfamilies, especially single-parent and female-headed\r\nfamilies, is the constant need to balance work and familial\r\nresponsibilities. There is a great need for social-support\r\nsystems appropriate to individual cases.\r\nOne of the major objectives of the International Year\r\nis the achievement of gender equity in the family, which\r\nentails the equal sharing of responsibilities. The sharing\r\nof roles by men and women requires new perspectives\r\nand patterns of partnership. It therefore seems necessary\r\nthat major attention be given to examining and fostering\r\nnew roles and responsibilities for men. Fathers could be\r\ngiven wider access to education in family life, and\r\nparental leave and other incentives could be provided, to\r\nencourage and enable them to play new, wider roles,\r\nespecially with regard to home-making, child care and\r\nfamily planning. Affected as they are by continuing\r\nsocial, economic, cultural and political pressures, women\r\nshould be enabled to explore new opportunities for\r\neducation and employment and to balance work and\r\nfamilial responsibilities.\r\nFamilies are valuable resources for the prevention of\r\ncrime and delinquency. An important issue is the\r\nprevention of domestic violence. Violence against women\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nand children is pervasive and affects families everywhere\r\nand in all social classes. Women experience violence as a\r\nform of control that limits their ability to pursue options in\r\nalmost every area of life. It hinders the human\r\ndevelopment of women themselves, and it affects the\r\nwell-being of children and families.\r\nWe welcome the appointment of the Special\r\nRapporteur on violence against women. This is one of the\r\nmost important results of the World Conference on Human\r\nRights, which took place in Vienna last year. In agreeing\r\nto appoint a Special Rapporteur, the Conference recognized\r\ngender-based violence in both public and private spheres as\r\na human-rights violation.\r\nThe activities instituted by the Liechtenstein National\r\nCoordinating Committee for the International Year of the\r\nFamily were based on the following considerations.\r\nChanges in human lives, and particularly in family life, are\r\nassociated with intense emotional and social experiences; in\r\nliving through these changes, awareness is beneficial to\r\nboth the personality and the community, and, accordingly,\r\ncan mitigate or even prevent the emergence of\r\npsychological and social problems, such as impoverishment,\r\naddiction and suicidal tendencies; ensuring the means of\r\nexistence, raising children and partnership are just a few of\r\nthe many tasks a family has to cope with; families are\r\npsychologically and socially overburdened and, accordingly,\r\nrequire support and assistance.\r\nOne of the key considerations in the implementation\r\nof the planned activities in Liechtenstein was that the\r\nfamily is where the changes occur and that the\r\nimplementation of measures in support of the home and of\r\nthe family should not lead to State control of the family.\r\nIn creating family-support infrastructures, the State and its\r\ninstitutions are only the backdrop. The stage on which the\r\naction takes place is the family itself. Supportive action\r\nshould be something shared, something creative and\r\ninnovative.\r\nIt was against this background that a programme for\r\nthe provision of assistance to families in times of crisis and\r\nperiods of transition was initiated. Further programmes\r\nfocus on drug addiction within the family, sexual\r\nexploitation of children, current problems in the field of\r\neducation, and crisis management within the family.\r\nIt has been said frequently that the family, being the\r\nnatural and fundamental group unit of society, is the\r\nfullest reflection of the strengths and weaknesses of a\r\ncommunity. In spite of the many changes in society that\r\nhave influenced its role, the family continues to provide\r\nthe natural framework for the emotional and material\r\nsupport that is essential to the growth and development of\r\nits members. A strong and democratic family should be\r\npromoted as an important element of an equally strong\r\nand democratic society.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Arabic): I now\r\ncall on the Deputy Permanent Representative of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, Mr. Gholamali Khoshroo.\r\nMr. Khoshroo (Islamic Republic of Iran): My\r\ndelegation wishes to begin its remarks by acknowledging\r\nand endorsing the rationale of the General Assembly’s\r\nunanimous proclamation of 1994 as the International Year\r\nof the Family - a Year to instill a global conviction to\r\nemploy intensified action and international cooperation on\r\nbehalf of families in order to advance social progress and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe family, as the most fundamental institution for\r\nhuman growth and happiness, has, in recent decades, been\r\nthreatened by structural and cultural transformations in\r\nWestern societies. The intrusion of the market approach\r\ninto everyday life has severely weakened the belief and\r\npractices which were common in family, religious and\r\nlocal communities. Such new processes have created\r\nserious moral problems rather than technical ones.\r\nAs modernism proceeds, strong ties in traditional\r\ncommunities become weaker and weaker, while the need\r\nto care for each other grows stronger and stronger. Thus,\r\nwe are in a paradoxical situation: to become more modern\r\nleads to a reliance on the market and bureaucracy, which\r\ncontributes to the destruction of modernism itself. To\r\nsolve this dilemma, we must attach utmost importance to\r\nthe family, education and religion. Through this\r\nrestructuring of everyday life and of social systems we\r\ncan create a proper balance between moral obligation and\r\nindividual freedom. It is very sad that in the current\r\nsituation the foundation of the family has become so\r\nweak that individual autonomy has replaced moral and\r\nsocial responsibility. Accordingly, narrow individualism,\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nwhich dramatically focuses on immediate personal affairs,\r\nis continuously developing at the cost of public happiness\r\nand social coherence. It is unfortunate that the mass media,\r\nin their competition in the market of popular art and\r\nculture, are provoking utilitarian and hedonistic\r\nindividualism, by dramatizing immediate desire, emotional\r\nfantasies and trivial concerns.\r\nSuch maximization of self-interest, accompanied by\r\nthe increasing attachment to the comforts of life, has led to\r\nthe dissolution of social ties and family relations. These\r\ntragic changes in Western societies have resulted in a high\r\nproportion of divorce - almost one out of two marriages -\r\nwidespread reluctance to marry, and an increasing\r\nacceptance of premarital and extra-marital sexual relations.\r\nWorse still, the spread of sexual abuse within the family\r\nand domestic violence have brought about an increasing\r\nnumber of runaways and crimes.\r\nThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has,\r\nsince its inception, made every effort to create a conducive\r\nand encouraging environment for families to flourish in.\r\nArticles 10, 21, 29, 30 31 and 43 of the Constitution of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran frame laws, regulations and\r\nnational plans connected with families and their stability.\r\nThese constitutional provisions are based on the principles\r\nof the Islamic law and code of conduct.\r\nThus, the Islamic Republic of Iran regards the family\r\nas the core of society and supports any movement that\r\ncontributes to its strengthening and enhancement.\r\nDeclaring 1994 the International Year of the Family\r\nemphasized the need for more intense attention to and a\r\nthorough re-evaluation of existing difficulties faced by\r\nfamilies in the world.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran supports the initiatives\r\nlaunched by the International Year of the Family because\r\nit believes in the need for expanding collective efforts to\r\neliminate common problems. We have participated\r\nwholeheartedly and actively in these activities. The first\r\nstep was the formation of a national committee comprising\r\nvarious organizations within the country. These\r\norganizations manage the affairs of children, women, youth,\r\nthe elderly and the disabled. The many sessions held by\r\nthis committee resulted in the compilation of a national\r\nreport.\r\nSpecific examples of Iran’s initiatives this year\r\ninclude a review of the Family Protection Law with help\r\nfrom the Office of Women’s Affairs and the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund in Tehran; the art competition\r\nstaged by the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for children in\r\nrefugee camps; the construction of libraries at refugee\r\ncamps in a collaborative effort between the UNHCR and\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior; the implementation of a\r\nnationwide immunization of children against polio by the\r\nMinistry of Health; the mobilization of the mass media to\r\npromote the International Year of the Family; the\r\nconvening of a regional conference on family issues held\r\nwith the cooperation of the United Nations Fund for\r\nPopulation Activities; the convening of youth seminars on\r\nmarriage and the family and the Parents and Teachers\r\nConference on the International Year of the Family.\r\nThe International Year of the Family is an\r\nopportunity to inform everyone of what countries have\r\ndone or intend to do to reinforce and strengthen the\r\nfamily institution. Here is the opportune moment to share\r\nthe fruits of our labour, our insights into difficulties, and\r\nour successful solutions. Without a doubt, enhanced\r\nregional and international cooperation in matters relating\r\nto the family and the preparation and implementation of\r\nproposals and plans to align socio-economic development\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nwith family interests will open the way for future\r\ncooperation in similar endeavours.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
