(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 95 (continued)\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family\r\nInternational Conference on Families\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call on\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Peru to the United\r\nNations, Ambassador Fernando Guillen Salas.\r\nMr. Guillen (Peru) (interpretation from Spanish): At\r\nthe outset allow me to express our support for the statement\r\nmade by the Ambassador of Paraguay on behalf of the\r\ncountries of Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nWe have come here today to reaffirm the importance\r\nof the family as the basic building-block of society, the\r\nsocial group in which the human person is reproduced. We\r\nwish to stress the fact that the family plays the important\r\nrole of giving society new members who can play an\r\nappropriate and constructive part in its social activities.\r\nThanks to the family, societies are renewed and transmit\r\ntheir special characteristics from one generation to the next.\r\nIt is the family that passes on the culture, and the history,\r\nthereby ensuring the continuity of a people.\r\nThere is a world-wide crisis of values. In Peru the\r\ndanger of social disintegration has been aggravated by a\r\nprolonged socio-economic crisis, which, fortunately, is\r\nbeing overcome. There have been other causes also —\r\ndemographic problems, migratory phenomena and urban\r\nsprawl. All of these factors have a negative effect on the\r\nharmonious development of the family and tend to its\r\nbreakdown.\r\nThe extreme poverty suffered by most of our\r\npopulation, which is related to the lack of basic services,\r\nis a factor that threatens the family. It deserves particular\r\nattention because it increases the vulnerability of the most\r\nvulnerable sectors, particularly women and children.\r\nTwo decades of terrorist violence and drug\r\ntrafficking and the corruption ensuing therefrom, have\r\nalso contributed seriously to the breakdown of the family.\r\nFor that reason we Peruvians enthusiastically hail the\r\nnational victory over terrorism and the Government’s\r\nresolution to combat drug trafficking.\r\nAt this stage of its history, Peruvian society, which\r\nis multicultural, is becoming more closely knit and is\r\nacquiring a greater degree of communication, all of which\r\nwill help to define the image of the new Peruvian citizen.\r\nThis will eventually bring about the integration of the two\r\nmost important cultural currents underlying a society that\r\nis the oldest of all in South America. These two formative\r\ncultural influences share the belief in the intrinsic value\r\nof the family for society.\r\nThe present effort being carried out by Peru in\r\nsupport of the family and its essential role in the integral\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\ndevelopment of the human person and in the development\r\nof the country as a whole can be divided into two areas of\r\naction.\r\nIn the sectoral area, I wish to mention in particular the\r\nfollowing initiatives: programmes for health care, with\r\nemphasis on the care of mothers and children through pre-\r\nand post-natal monitoring programmes, breast-feeding,\r\nmonitoring of the growth and development of the child, and\r\nvaccination campaigns, among others; educational\r\nprogrammes with special attention to helping working\r\nmothers by setting up the national programme of wawa\r\nwasis — children’s homes — and the integrated programme\r\nof education for life; food-support programmes through the\r\n“glass-of-milk programme” which seeks to provide children\r\nand expectant and nursing mothers with the nutritional\r\nsupplements that they need; constitutional recognition of the\r\nimportance of the family as the building-block of society,\r\nand an up-to-date set of legal regulations that is in\r\nconformity with reality, the institution of the family,\r\nmatrimony, cohabitation and the rights that arise from the\r\ninheritance laws, legal measures for the protection of the\r\nfamily, and regulations governing family property, among\r\nothers; a broad-based programme focusing on basic\r\nmultisector social expenditure that gives priority to\r\nintervention in favour of the neediest families in rural areas\r\nand in the marginal city areas, improving the quality of\r\ncoverage and the efficiency of basic social expenditure for\r\nservices in education, basic justice, health, and\r\nsupplementary nutrition; and the programme of support for\r\nrevitalization of the population in the poorest areas of the\r\ncountry.\r\nAs regards institutions, I wish to emphasize the\r\nfollowing basic ideas and initiatives carried out by the\r\nNational Institute for Family Welfare.\r\nThe main goal of the Institute is to strengthen the\r\nfamily, fostering the development and improvement of\r\nconditions for the family, ensuring its integrated\r\ndevelopment in a climate of harmony, respect for the\r\nculture and the values of each group of people, and\r\naccepting the challenge of providing them with training to\r\ngive them the capacity to become useful beings for society\r\nand for themselves.\r\nThe Institute has as its premise the idea that neither\r\nviolence nor poverty can justify the breakdown of family\r\nties, which are the sole guarantee of the training of\r\nresponsible adults who can play a useful part in society.\r\nSimilarly, it is aware that Peruvian families are carrying out\r\nnew forms of survival through self-management\r\norganizations that enable them to face the social,\r\neconomic and moral crisis in a spirit of solidarity, playing\r\nthe leading role that is theirs within the process of social\r\nchange. In regard to this group, special mention should be\r\nmade of the active role played by Peruvian women in the\r\nstruggle to improve living conditions and chances of\r\nsurvival in the poorest sectors of the country.\r\nCombining family well-being and active participation\r\nby the community, the Institute works on the basis of two\r\nprogrammatic approaches.\r\nFirst, there is the furtherance of social welfare\r\ndirected towards the carrying out of preventive and\r\npromotional programmes, giving priority to the value of\r\nthe family as the initial formative force in the\r\ndevelopment of the human person, emphasizing services\r\nfor minors, the elderly, the family and the community,\r\nand promoting active organized participation by its\r\nmembers.\r\nSecondly, there is the programmatic aspect of the\r\nsocial integration of children and adolescents who are in\r\nespecially difficult circumstances. Special attention is\r\ndirected towards the problems of children and adolescents\r\nfrom birth to 18 years of age in cases where they have\r\ndifficulties in achieving integrated development because\r\nof bio-psycho-social deficiencies. These are minors who\r\nhave been abandoned, who are in moral danger, who have\r\nbehavioural problems or who are on the fringes of the\r\nlaw. Basic clothing, housing and health care are provided\r\nto all of them as well as psychological assistance, socio-\r\nfamilial, behavioural, educational and specialized labour\r\nassistance. An effort is being made to help them adopt\r\nacceptable patterns of social behaviour so that they can\r\nbecome reintegrated into society and the family.\r\nPeru is taking resolute action to resolve the urgent\r\nproblems of its population. The consolidation of\r\ndemocracy and progress in economic restructuring, the\r\nrecovery of peace and growth now make it possible for\r\nmy country to give social problems, and within social\r\nproblems the strengthening of the family, the priority that\r\nthey deserve. I wish to emphasize along these lines that\r\nwe are seeking the implementation of a holistic approach\r\nthat articulates economic, social and pacification policies\r\nin a rational way.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on Her Excellency, Mrs. Miriam Sirelkhatim, State\r\nMinister, Ministry of Social Planning of the Sudan.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nMrs. Sirelkhatim (Sudan) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): From a homeland where family values reign, I\r\nshould like to greet you, Mr. President, on behalf of Sudan,\r\nits people and its Government. I should like to hail the\r\ninterest accorded by the international community to the\r\nfamily, as reflected by the holding of this meeting at such\r\na high level of representation in this international forum.\r\nThe family is the nucleus of society and its solid\r\nfoundation. It is the ideal environment for character-\r\nbuilding. We think that the family is useful to the extent\r\nthat it follows moral criteria for selecting spouses on the\r\nbasis of piety and love between the spouses. The two\r\nspouses should educate their children on the basis of piety,\r\nwithout discriminating in any way between girls and boys,\r\nso that they may grow up imbued with positive moral\r\nvalues, proper behaviour and generosity.\r\nSocial and moral values should be inculcated in\r\nchildren, who should be given opportunities for proper\r\ninteraction with their entire environment, beginning with\r\ntheir parents and including their neighbours and society as\r\na whole. They should also receive a proper education and\r\nenjoy a happy childhood as members of society and in their\r\nimmediate environment. They should, then, be aware of the\r\nsociety that surrounds them and respect it through, for\r\nexample, acquiring a love of art and beauty. Children\r\nshould also understand the munificence of the universe and\r\nthe importance for human beings of following the proper\r\npath and preserving the environment, as well as the need to\r\nlove their work, their neighbour and their homeland.\r\nChildren should be brought up to have a positive\r\nattitude towards all humanity and should be imbued with a\r\nspirit of sacrifice and generosity. Open-minded dialogue\r\nand social interaction should help them follow the path of\r\nrighteousness and avoid evil. They should accept diversity\r\nand differences of opinion, and they should be generous.\r\nThese are also values which they should be taught to\r\nacquire.\r\nIn Sudan we are proud of our social cohesion and\r\nsocial interdependence. The family enjoys a special place\r\nin our society, which is characterized by relatively large\r\nfamilies. The State treats the family as part of its national\r\nand comprehensive strategy. Furthermore, the Ministry for\r\nSocial Planning was created in order to develop society on\r\nthe basis of a global concept. It is the largest Ministry in\r\nSudan.\r\nIn addition, family councils have been set up with the\r\naim of helping couples who wish to get married to obtain\r\nthe necessary resources, for example, through communal\r\nmarriages ceremonies. Special councils have been set up\r\nin order to organize such communal marriage ceremonies.\r\nIn 1994, the Sudanese State attached great\r\nimportance to the celebration of the International Year of\r\nthe Family, pursuant to General Assembly resolution\r\n47/237. In this connection, the Minister for Social\r\nPlanning issued ministerial decree number 21 of 1994 to\r\ncreate a national committee under the chairmanship of the\r\nMinister of State for Social Planning within the\r\nframework of the International Year’s official celebration.\r\nThe committee’s functions include providing for the\r\nprotection of the family, ensuring social justice and\r\ncohesion and securing prosperity of our citizens on the\r\nbasis of full respect for their economic and social rights.\r\nThe committee is also concerned with the protection of\r\nthe child.\r\nRural and immigrant families also receive enjoy\r\nspecial assistance. Special training programmes for the\r\nwomen of such families have been introduced. It is hoped\r\nthat, on 31 October 1994, there will be a special\r\ncolloquium in Khartoum on the social and human aspects\r\nof the Sudanese family.\r\nAs part of the interest shown in the family,\r\nvulnerable families and orphans are cared for by the\r\nState. A ministerial decree has been issued on the\r\nprovision of assistance to orphans and their mothers.\r\nGeneral guidelines have been laid down accordingly in\r\norder, inter alia, to develop the means of funding, data\r\nand statistics gathering and reviewing existing legislation.\r\nThe Sudanese State has undertaken an ambitious plan of\r\nprotection that covers children who live in precarious\r\ncircumstances, especially those of refugees. Medical\r\nassistance and education are given to these children. In\r\nthis regard, I should like to appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to provide the necessary assistance so that\r\nthose children who have been kidnapped by the rebel\r\nmovement might be able to return to Sudan and to their\r\nfamilies. Those children were in fact taken away by force.\r\nWe would like to appeal to the international community\r\nto condemn these acts.\r\nA council for productive families has been set up to\r\nassist such families. The council helps those families to\r\nmarket their products and, thereby to improve their\r\nstandard of living. The high-level committee for\r\nproductive families has held intensive meetings, and 300\r\nmillion Sudanese pounds have been allocated to projects\r\nfor families involved in production.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nThe Sudanese Government has declared the year 1994\r\nthe year for providing all families with clothing. To this\r\nend, a special committee has been set up by a presidential\r\ndecree. The Sudanese people at large have been urged to\r\ngive their unwanted clothes to the needy. The committee\r\nhas begun its work under the chairmanship of the\r\nPresident’s Office of the Republic, the speaker of the\r\nNational Assembly and various federal ministers. The\r\nCommittee has done very good work so far and has\r\nprovided a large number of people with much-needed\r\nclothing under the slogan: “Clothing for All”.\r\nThe special attention my country devotes to women,\r\nhas ensured for women the enjoyment of the same political\r\nrights, education and medical care as men. Salaries are\r\nequal for equal work. Women have also achieved high-level\r\nstatus within government. Sixty-five per cent of girls\r\nreceive an education, in the context of our interest in\r\nwomen as spouses and mothers.\r\nAs to education, my country has focused on the\r\neradication of illiteracy. In the western part of the country,\r\nwe have achieved a 100 per cent literacy rate. University\r\neducation is also expanding on a large scale. As to medical\r\nservices and family planning, campaigns have been\r\nlaunched, especially in rural areas, to distribute medicine to\r\nchildren and pregnant women. Meetings and campaigns\r\nhave been organized on health care for women and\r\nfamilies. I am particularly proud to state that my country\r\nhas been commended by the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund for its vaccination campaign, in which 85 per cent of\r\nour children have been immunized.\r\nAs to the protection of the environment, the Sudanese\r\nState is developing alternative energy resources and making\r\nit possible for families to earn a living without damaging\r\nthe environment. For example, the use of solar cooking is\r\nbeing encouraged.\r\nThe handicapped also enjoy special attention from the\r\nSudanese Government. They enjoy all rights without\r\ndiscrimination. In spite of the limited resources at the\r\ndisposal of the State, opportunities for education and\r\nprofessional training are provided and we hope that\r\ninternational assistance will increase, and this makes it\r\npossible for the disabled to be fully reintegrated into\r\nsociety. The State is making a particular effort to provide\r\nvaccines, especially against polio. As a result, there has\r\nbeen a considerable reduction in the number of victims of\r\nthat crippling disease. With a view to protecting the family,\r\nthe Sudanese State has raised the slogan of “sports for all”,\r\nso that all citizens may lead a healthy life. The elderly, for\r\ntheir part, are protected by the Sudanese State and enjoy\r\ngreat respect in our society, especially as our religion\r\nurges us to respect our elders, as well as our neighbours,\r\nthe poor, orphans and the disinherited.\r\nAs we celebrate the International Year of the\r\nFamily, we hope that we are laying the foundations for a\r\nunited family, the building block of tomorrow’s society.\r\nWe must imbue our families with moral values and\r\nabolish social discrimination on the basis of religion,\r\nethnicity or culture. Moral values ensure the cohesion of\r\nsociety and should be consolidated. Social protection for\r\nall should be ensured through education, rehabilitation,\r\nmedical services, clothing, food and proper housing. We\r\ncannot achieve this without an international commitment\r\nto these objectives. We are proud to propose the idea of\r\na productive family, which would contribute to solving\r\nthe problem of poverty in the world. It is with great pride\r\nthat we propose the moral values of Sudan as the best\r\nmodel for families throughout the world.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\nshould like to inform representatives that draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.5, entitled “Twenty-fifth anniversary of the\r\noperations of the United Nations Population Fund” has\r\nbeen circulated in the Hall this afternoon and will be\r\nconsidered tomorrow, Thursday, 20 October, in the\r\nmorning.\r\nI should also like to inform delegations that on\r\nFriday, 21 October 1994, in the morning, the Assembly\r\nwill consider agenda item 21, entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States”, agenda item 29, “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem”, and sub-item (b) of agenda item 16, “Election\r\nof seven members of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination”.\r\nIn the afternoon the Assembly will hold the debate\r\non agenda item 89(d), “Elaboration of an international\r\nconvention to combat desertification in those countries\r\nexperiencing serious drought and/or desertification,\r\nparticularly in Africa”.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nAgenda item 95 (continued)\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family\r\nInternational Conference on Families\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nnext on the representative of Pakistan, Mr. Jan Ali Junejo.\r\nMr. Junejo (Pakistan): Pakistan welcomes the holding\r\nof the International Conference on Families. We convey our\r\nappreciation to the secretariat of the International Year of\r\nthe Family for making the Year a success. This Conference\r\nprovides us with an opportunity to review the activities of\r\nthe International Year of the Family and to discuss ways\r\nand means of putting together a comprehensive and\r\ncohesive programme for follow-up to the Year.\r\nAll United Nations instruments refer to the family as\r\nthe basic unit of society. It therefore has a key role in\r\nmaking or unmaking a society or defining its strengths and\r\nweaknesses. It is the responsibility of Governments to\r\nprotect and assist families and to promote their inherent\r\nstrengths to enable them to function as self-reliant and self-\r\nsustaining units in communities and nations. The\r\nInternational Bill of Human Rights provides an excellent\r\nframework for achieving these objectives.\r\nThe centrality of the family to the development of the\r\nhuman individual was one of the themes highlighted by\r\nPrime Minister Benazir Bhutto in her statement at the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nheld in Cairo recently. The Prime Minister stressed:\r\n“The traditional family is the basic unit on which any\r\nsociety rests. It is the anchor on which the individual\r\nrelies as he embarks upon the journey of life. Islam\r\naims at harmonious lives built upon a bedrock of\r\nconjugal fidelity and parental responsibility.”\r\nWe should underscore the critical need for the family to\r\nreceive comprehensive support and protection.\r\nThe Programme of Action adopted by the International\r\nConference on Population and Development has reiterated\r\nthe importance of the family in society. Principle 9 and\r\nchapter V of that Programme deal not only with the\r\ndefinition of the family but also with issues such as the\r\neffect on the family unit of greater participation by women\r\nin the labour force; widespread migration; and forced\r\npopulation shifts caused by violent conflict or war,\r\nurbanization, poverty, natural disasters or other causes of\r\ndisplacement. In our deliberations today we should build\r\nupon the international consensus on these issues.\r\nThe objectives of the International Year of the\r\nFamily have also received substantive support from the\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights. The final document\r\nadopted by the human rights Conference addressed\r\nindividual human rights in the context of family\r\nrelationships and emphasized the positive role that\r\nfamilies can play in the promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nWe should maintain the momentum generated by\r\nthose Conferences and by the activities held in observance\r\nof the International Year of the Family. The forthcoming\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, the United\r\nNations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the\r\nTreatment of Offenders and the Fourth World Conference\r\non Women all present valuable opportunities for placing\r\nthe role of the family in its rightful context. We should\r\nstrengthen the family-related components of the\r\ndeclarations and programmes of action of those\r\nconferences. At the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, we should try to build consensus for\r\ngenerating additional resources to eradicate the poverty\r\nand unemployment affecting the poorest families in the\r\nworld.\r\nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations, in his\r\nmessage on the occasion of the launching of the Year,\r\npointed out that families had only recently become the\r\nfocus of international attention, both as major agents and\r\nas beneficiaries of sustainable development. When we\r\nlook back, we note with satisfaction that observance of\r\nthe International Year of the Family has achieved\r\nconsiderable progress in enhancing awareness of family\r\nissues among Governments and all other actors of civil\r\nsociety. During the Year, special attention has been paid\r\nto the economic, social and demographic factors affecting\r\nfamilies. However, the more important and difficult tasks\r\nof strengthening national institutions and international\r\ncooperation to address and solve these problems require\r\nconsistent, resolute and coherent efforts.\r\nToday, families all over the world are experiencing\r\nconsiderable change. In the developed countries, the\r\ncivilization of the post-industrial era is searching for\r\nappropriate models for the family. In the developing\r\ncountries, the main problem is the survival of the majority\r\nof families, who live below the poverty line. The\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\ndeteriorating economic situation in the poor countries,\r\nmigration, urbanization and population growth have created\r\nserious material and spiritual crises for the family.\r\nConstantly changing economic and social structures have\r\nthrown up new challenges that are beyond the capacity of\r\ntraditional systems. The families affected need the help of\r\ntheir Governments and of the international community.\r\nFamilies provide emotional support and serve to\r\nnurture social and economic well-being. They define and\r\nshape the cultural ethos of a society and transmit societal\r\nvalues from one generation to the next. Therefore, it is of\r\nthe utmost importance that all members of the family —\r\nwomen, children, youth, the elderly and disabled persons —\r\nshould be protected from exploitation, violence and abuse.\r\nWe should promote a culture of respect for the rights of\r\nwomen, of the protection and development of children and\r\nof care for the elderly, the disabled and the infirm.\r\nGovernments, private enterprises, non-governmental\r\norganizations and international agencies should formulate\r\nand implement “family-sensitive” policies so that the family\r\nmay be enabled to act as a medium for promoting healthy\r\nvalues and socio-economic development.\r\nMrs. Hoenigsperger (Austria), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe structural adjustment programmes imposed in the\r\ndeveloping countries often result in the retrenchment of\r\nessential social services. They place increasing burdens on\r\nthe family, particularly on women, children and other\r\nvulnerable family members. Priority must be given to\r\nencouraging and strengthening the fledgling social support\r\nsystems that ensure the basic conditions for the\r\ndevelopment of a family.\r\nThe income-generating capacities of families, which\r\nare so crucial, can be strengthened in a stable, progressive\r\nand vibrant economic environment. The majority of the\r\ndeveloping countries, trapped in a vicious circle of heavy\r\ndebts, dwindling economic assistance, inequitable trade\r\nregimes and inadequate investment, cannot hope to ensure\r\nbetter living standards for their families. The United\r\nNations, its specialized agencies and the international\r\ncommunity should implement national efforts to eradicate\r\nilliteracy, provide basic health care and implement\r\npopulation welfare programmes.\r\nThe International Year of the Family has not been able\r\nto focus adequately on the plight of families living in\r\nconditions of war, armed conflict and civil strife. In Bosnia,\r\nPalestine, Kashmir, Rwanda, Azerbaijan and many other\r\nparts of the world, families have suffered collectively as a\r\nresult of repression and atrocities. In 1994 alone,\r\nhundreds of thousands of people were killed; women were\r\nraped; children were mutilated and killed; and homes\r\nwere destroyed. Particularly vicious has been the practice\r\nof State-sponsored violence against innocent families in\r\norder to humiliate and terrorize entire communities. Rape\r\nhas been used as an instrument of war. The Year should\r\nhave been an occasion to express the international\r\ncommunity’s strong moral condemnation of these\r\natrocities, but the focus, regrettably, has remained only on\r\nstable or quasi-stable societies. The movement of refugees\r\nand displaced persons fleeing oppression or environmental\r\ndegradation has resulted in the disruption of these family\r\nunits everywhere in the world. In addition, immigrant\r\nworkers worldwide are facing increasing discrimination\r\nand persecution.\r\nWe urge all Member States, while finalizing specific\r\nproposals for the implementation of the follow-up to the\r\nYear, to make provisions for the return and rehabilitation\r\nof families traumatized and victimized during armed\r\nconflicts and civil strife.\r\nFamilies in different parts of the world face different\r\nimpediments in realizing their full potential for\r\ndevelopment. Our experience in Pakistan has been that\r\nefforts in the legal, educational and cultural spheres can\r\nyield significant results. In this context, conscious of the\r\nrole of women in family structures, the Prime Minister of\r\nPakistan, Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, has taken a personal\r\ninterest in putting an end to domestic violence against\r\nwomen. Under her leadership, the Government is\r\ncommitted to ensuring equal rights for men and women.\r\nWe are committed to repealing all discriminatory laws\r\nand to signing the United Nations Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen.\r\nAs a first step towards the empowerment of women,\r\n25 seats have been reserved for women in the National\r\nAssembly of Pakistan, and a specific percentage of\r\ngovernment jobs has been earmarked for women. The\r\nlegal protection of women, along with their economic\r\nempowerment, can play a significant role in strengthening\r\nfamilies. Recently, we launched a project to increase the\r\nrepresentation of women in the criminal justice\r\nadministration. Incentives have been given to non-\r\ngovernmental organizations to undertake projects at the\r\ngrass-roots level on a public-private partnership basis. In\r\nnational development planning, priority has been assigned\r\nto health care, employment generation and population\r\nwelfare.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nI must also add that Pakistan, as one of the co-\r\ninitiators of the World Summit for Children, attaches\r\nspecial importance to the implementation of the World\r\nDeclaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of\r\nChildren.\r\nThe International Year of the Family is a significant\r\nstarting- point for a long-term process. When the Year is\r\nover, we hope that the family, the essential component of\r\nall healthy societies, will not be forgotten by Governments\r\nand international agencies.\r\nThe President: I call next on the representative of\r\nMongolia, Mr. L. Bayart, Director of the International\r\nOrganizations Department of the Ministry of External\r\nRelations of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Bayart (Mongolia): We have gathered here to\r\ndiscuss the status of world-wide activities in observance of\r\nthe International Year of the Family and to set guidelines\r\nfor further global action in support of families. In our view,\r\nthe high policy-making level of participants is ample\r\nevidence of increased public and international awareness of\r\nthe family issue and of the recognition by the community\r\nof nations of its far-reaching importance.\r\nAs we come closer to the end of the International\r\nYear of the Family we have a good opportunity to sum up\r\nthe work already accomplished, identify major challenges\r\nthat lie ahead and forge the necessary global consensus\r\ntowards articulating forward-looking strategies for the good\r\nof families. The observance of the Year should, indeed,\r\nlead to a long-term process of integrating a more\r\npronounced family component into both national\r\ndevelopment strategies and international cooperation.\r\nIt is heartening to note that in response to the United\r\nNations initiative more than 150 countries have set up\r\nnational coordinating bodies and formulated relevant plans\r\nof action in preparation for and observance of the Year.\r\nNational efforts are being complemented by specific\r\nmeasures at the regional and international levels. A\r\ncrucially important contribution was the holding of four\r\nregional and interregional preparatory meetings for the\r\nYear, which developed specific action-oriented\r\nrecommendations. Here, I wish to take note of the Beijing\r\nDeclaration on the Family in Asia and the Pacific adopted\r\nby the United Nations Asia and the Pacific preparatory\r\nmeeting for the Year, held in May 1993.\r\nThe United Nations is in the vanguard of this global\r\nmovement, as a number of its entities have been actively\r\nengaged in an intensive and coordinated preparatory\r\nprocess. My delegation wishes to commend the work\r\nbeing done by the secretariat for the International Year of\r\nthe Family and its Coordinator, Mr. Henryk Sakolski, to\r\nset in motion a concerted campaign and provide\r\norganizational and substantive support to numerous\r\ninitiatives around the world.\r\nAn impressive array of non-governmental\r\norganizations have throughout been our important partners\r\nin the preparation for and observance of the Year. Here\r\nspecial mention should in our view be made of the World\r\nForum of non-governmental organizations on launching\r\nthe International Year of the Family, a major global\r\nconvocation of non-governmental organizations held in\r\nMalta late last year.\r\nWorldwide, the family has been undergoing constant\r\ntransformation resulting from social and cultural changes,\r\neconomic upheavals and the pressures of modernization\r\nand development. Traditional definitions of family\r\nstructure based on two major types, nuclear and extended\r\nfamilies, are being enriched with the emergence of new\r\nfamily types such as cohabitation, same-gender\r\nrelationships and single-parent and reorganized families.\r\nAlthough such changes differ from country to country, the\r\nfundamental function of the family as a basic unit in\r\nsociety remains unchanged. And, as such, families\r\nprovide the fullest reflection of the strengths and\r\nweaknesses of the social and developmental welfare\r\nenvironment, thereby offering a uniquely comprehensive\r\nhuman-centred approach to development, and to social\r\nissues in particular. In this sense, we believe that major\r\nupcoming world events such as the Social Summit and\r\nthe international conferences on women and on human\r\nsettlements should give due consideration to the family\r\ncomponent in formulating their strategies and programmes\r\nof action.\r\nWe welcome the opportunity offered by the\r\nInternational Year of the Family to focus attention on the\r\nnumerous family issues, and in particular on that of\r\nvulnerable families. Single-parent families, especially the\r\ngrowing number of households headed by females, are\r\namong the poorest. It is estimated that one third of all\r\nfamilies are now single-parent families where a woman is\r\nthe sole bread-winner. The poverty level of families with\r\ndisabled members is also high. Labour migration to\r\nsecure a livelihood is frequently a source of family\r\ntension and disintegration. Refugee and internationally\r\ndisplaced families are another group of families at risk.\r\nFamilies affected by the human immunodeficiency virus\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\n(HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\r\nrequire particular attention. Family breakdown is reflected\r\nin increasing domestic violence, drug and alcohol addiction,\r\nsexual abuse, and child abuse and neglect. There is still\r\nmuch to be done to raise awareness of these problems with\r\na view to addressing them adequately. With that in view,\r\nmy delegation believes that the international community\r\nshould now actively work to formulate a sound follow-up\r\nof the Year to sustain its momentum.\r\nPursuant to General Assembly resolution 44/82, which\r\nproclaimed 1994 the International Year of the Family, the\r\nfocus of activities for observance of the Year is at the local\r\nand national levels. In Mongolia as in many other countries,\r\na national committee for the International Year of the\r\nFamily was set up earlier this year. The Committee is\r\nheaded by the Minister of Population and Labour and is\r\ncomposed of representatives of key Government ministries,\r\nlocal authorities, non-governmental organizations and the\r\nmass media. At its first meeting the Committee adopted a\r\nnational plan of action, which includes the following\r\nelements, among others: review of existing family\r\nlegislation and enactment of new laws on the rights of\r\nchildren and the aged; formulation of a comprehensive\r\nnational policy designed to strengthen and support families;\r\nlaunching of research campaigns under the themes “Family\r\nand population development”, “Family and equality”,\r\n“Family households under a market economy”, “Family\r\nconcepts and the traditional way of life of Mongols”, and\r\nothers; organization of a national conference on the\r\nprotection of maternal and child health and the family;\r\nestablishment of family-counselling centres in rural and\r\nurban areas; nationwide observance of 15 May as the\r\nInternational Day of the Family to promote awareness of\r\nthe Year’s objectives and of national priorities; and a series\r\nof mass-media publications and radio and television\r\nbroadcasts on the global and national activities to observe\r\nthe Year.\r\nNational preparatory activities helped to reveal more\r\nvividly the existence of acute family-related problems.\r\nTheir predominant causes can be largely ascribed to the\r\nupheavals of transition. Dismantling of the old system of\r\neconomic governance, coupled with the abrupt disruption of\r\nthe external economic and trade environment, resulted in a\r\nsharp economic decline, and the emergence of such social\r\nevils as poverty and unemployment. Aside from the\r\neconomic sphere, the transition process involves the social,\r\ncultural and spiritual life of Mongols, bringing with it other,\r\nno lesser challenges, including, inter alia, the deterioration\r\nof the social safety net and the educational system. All\r\nthese factors have caused a marked decline in the living\r\nstandards of the population, which directly affects the\r\nwell-being of families. Fully aware of the existing\r\nsituation, the Government of Mongolia is taking bold\r\nmeasures, allocating more than 20 per cent of its budget\r\nto human-priority concerns and executing strategies to\r\nimprove the status of children, women, the aged and other\r\nvulnerable groups.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to express its\r\nfull support for the objectives of the International Year of\r\nthe Family and its commitment to promoting them\r\nfurther.\r\nThe President: I call next on the representative of\r\nNew Zealand, Mr. John McKinnon.\r\nMr. McKinnon (New Zealand): The symbol chosen\r\nas the logo for the International Year of the Family, a\r\nheart sheltered by a roof, is an apt one. Nineteen ninety-\r\nfour, the International Year of the Family, has been taken\r\nto heart in New Zealand. There has been celebration of\r\nthe fundamental role played by the family in all its\r\ndiverse forms. There has been work, looking at issues\r\nimportant to the place of the family in our community.\r\nThese activities will help us carry forward the aims of the\r\nInternational Year. They will make a difference to family\r\nparticipation in our society.\r\nNew Zealand’s participation in the Year has been\r\nsubstantial. Through Government funding, an International\r\nYear of the Family Committee was appointed early in\r\nOctober 1993. Prominent New Zealanders active in\r\nproviding services to families were invited to form this\r\nCommittee, which worked in liaison with the Department\r\nof Social Welfare.\r\nThe Government recognized the importance of the\r\nUnited Nations objectives for the Year in stimulating\r\nlocal, national and international action as part of a\r\nsustained long-term effort to increase awareness of family\r\nissues and highlight the importance of families. The New\r\nZealand Committee had two primary objectives: first, to\r\nreinforce that the family is the principal medium for the\r\nsocialization, education, care and protection of children;\r\nand, secondly, to provide an education programme on\r\nways to promote and access services for families across\r\nall the programmes available both in the Government and\r\nin the voluntary sectors in New Zealand.\r\nTo fulfil these objectives the Committee identified\r\nthree key activity areas. Generating awareness was the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nfirst, the second was facilitating community activity and the\r\nthird was information-gathering.\r\nThere is certainly a high level of awareness of the\r\nYear in New Zealand. It was launched at dawn on\r\n1 January 1994 in Gisborne, the first city in the world to\r\ngreet the new year and the new day. The ceremony\r\ninvolved Ministers, media, personalities and the leaders\r\nfrom the Maori community. The national theme song for\r\nthe Year, “Good for Life”, by a prominent New Zealand\r\nband, has become familiar to most of our people. The\r\ntheme statement, “The family is good for life”, has aided\r\nthe promotion of the Year, and a related theme is adopted\r\nfor each month of 1994. Research in July suggested that\r\n85 per cent of adults were aware of the International Year.\r\nCommunity activity for the Year has been sustained through\r\nseveral initiatives. Twenty “honourary ambassadors” were\r\nappointed for the Year. These were prominent New\r\nZealanders involved in promoting the Year nationally and\r\nlocally. Additionally, International Year of the Family\r\ncoordinators were appointed by local governments.\r\nIn the area of information-gathering, the major\r\nresearch project commissioned by the Government of New\r\nZealand for the International Year of the Family has been\r\nparticularly important. The project is called “Accessing\r\nFamily Services”. It is founded on the Government’s\r\nconcern that families should have appropriate access to\r\neffective and coordinated sources of help and advice in\r\ntimes of family crisis. Research into how the agencies\r\nproviding these services communicate with their clients has\r\nbeen undertaken, as has consumer research in local\r\ncommunities. As a result, information programmes relating\r\nto a broad range of services nationally are expected to be\r\nrevised, augmented and monitored on a continuing basis.\r\nSo, the project will contribute significantly to the\r\nempowerment of families within society and have long-term\r\nbenefits.\r\nJust as important as the Government’s input has been\r\nthe community response to the Year in New Zealand. It is\r\nthis that has made the Year for us. Thirty community-\r\ninitiated projects for the Year have been funded from an\r\nallocation by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board. They\r\nhave included family violence intervention projects, cultural\r\nspecific services and parent support projects. An illustration\r\nis a pilot project on parenting skills based on kaupapa\r\nMaori, or Maori cultural principles.\r\nAnd so, at the conclusion of the International Year of\r\nthe Family, it is particularly heartening to be able to say\r\nthat new services are becoming available to families, as\r\nwell as increased information about existing services.\r\nResearch on family issues initiated during the Year\r\ncontinues in academic institutions. Recent policy emphasis\r\non promoting and supporting the role of families in\r\nsociety has been reinforced for the future. This includes\r\ninnovative legislation passed in 1989 for involving\r\nextended families in decision-making in child welfare\r\ncases.\r\nNew Zealand looks forward to the visit of\r\nMr. Henryk Sakolski, Coordinator for the International\r\nYear of the Family, in early December. We are delighted\r\nthat Mr. Sakolski will be giving the keynote address at an\r\ninternational conference in Auckland on strengthening\r\nfamilies. We expect the conference’s results to feed\r\ndirectly into Government policy development processes,\r\ntogether with the outcomes of other International Year of\r\nthe Family initiatives.\r\nWe have also been pleased to be able to contribute\r\ninternationally to the Year, including through funding\r\nseveral International Year of the Family projects in the\r\nSouth and South-East Asia region. Studies relating to\r\nliteracy in the Jaipur district in India and to the families\r\nof street children in the Philippines were two such\r\nprojects. We were also pleased to fund a women’s\r\nentrepreneurship development programme in India.\r\nThe Year is an opportunity to promote new\r\nawareness of the multiple crises that families anywhere\r\ncan face and of what can be done to avert them. Families\r\naround the world vary in their form and structure. Many\r\ndiffering strengths come from this diversity. Building on\r\nthe basis of such differences is particularly relevant as we\r\nmove towards 1995, the United Nations Year for\r\nTolerance.\r\nWe are hopeful that the tangible benefits of the\r\nmany activities carried out world-wide during the course\r\nof the International Year of the Family will continue to be\r\nrealized over time. We have seen the central role of\r\nwomen in development highlighted in the context of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment. We will continue to look for emphasis to\r\nbe placed on the situation of women, children, youth,\r\nageing persons, disabled persons and indigenous people\r\nin the context of preparations for the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development in Copenhagen next year.\r\nWe firmly believe that there must be a strong focus\r\non the role of the family if the many and complex social\r\nissues faced by societies today are to be addressed\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nsuccessfully. Let us hope that families in countries that are\r\nthemselves in crisis will also gradually benefit from the\r\nunderstanding and support of those in more fortunate\r\ncircumstances. The importance of the family to nations’\r\nsurvival cannot be underestimated. We salute the\r\ninternational humanitarian agencies engaged in working in\r\nthese situations, where families are very often\r\ndisempowered and fragmented.\r\nWe must now work to ensure that the efforts made\r\nduring 1994 to recognize, support and celebrate the role of\r\nthe family have a continuing influence on the international\r\nsocial agenda.\r\nFinally, let me return to the image of the United\r\nNations logo for the Year. The roof over the heart can\r\nsymbolize the shelter given to the individual within his or\r\nher family. It may also stand for the recognition and\r\nsupport our societies can give to the families within them,\r\nwith their diverse forms and faces.\r\nThe President: I call next on the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\r\nMr. Mohamed A. Azwai.\r\nMr. Azwai (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): The celebration of the International Year of\r\nthe Family in 1994 reflects the international community’s\r\nawareness, as represented by this General Assembly of the\r\nUnited Nations, that the family is the embodiment at the\r\npopular level of all the strengths and weaknesses in the\r\nfields of social and developmental welfare in society and\r\nthat it provides society with a uniquely comprehensive\r\nmeans of tackling all social issues. There is also the\r\nawareness that the family is the fundamental social unit and\r\nthe principal and effective factor in the process of\r\ndevelopment at every level.\r\nThis celebration also reflects the awareness of the\r\ninternational community that the family, as the fundamental\r\nsocial unit, faces the threat of deterioration and\r\ndisintegration today as a result of a number of social,\r\neconomic and political factors and due to the many\r\nconflicts and wars now raging in many parts of the world.\r\nSuch factors have led to the destruction and disintegration\r\nof thousands of families. In addition, there has been the\r\nimpact of economic pressures arising from the dire poverty\r\nin which millions of families live in all parts of the world.\r\nThis makes it incumbent upon us not to be content with\r\ncelebrating but rather to focus on setting up practical\r\nprogrammes for protecting and developing the family and\r\neliminating those threats to its stability and survival.\r\nWe in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya believe that an\r\nindividual without family has no meaning and no social\r\nlife and that if human society sinks to the point where\r\nmen exist and develop outside the family, it will turn into\r\na gathering of lost, uprooted hoboes. The unspeakable\r\nthings we witness nowadays, such as vagrancy, juvenile\r\ndelinquency, the trade in children, their prostitution,\r\npornography, the spread of drugs and AIDS, are all\r\ncauses and effects of the disintegration of the family.\r\nNow the international community has the opportunity\r\nafforded by a number of forthcoming international\r\nconferences to remedy those grave social ills, particularly\r\nduring the World Summit on Social Development in\r\nDenmark and the World Conference on Women in\r\nBeijing next year.\r\nLibya’s concern with the family and its protection is\r\nnot a thing of the recent past. It has very deep roots in\r\nthe traditions of my country, as well as in the Arab-\r\nIslamic culture to which we belong. Libyan legislation\r\ntherefore contains many laws on the protection of the\r\nfamily. The law decrees that every individual has the\r\nright to form a family. All minors whose families have\r\nbeen lost or have disintegrated for any reason, as well as\r\nthe handicapped, the infirm and the aged, have the right\r\nto full social welfare. The Libyan penal code further\r\nincludes laws for penalties against crimes perpetrated\r\nagainst the family, such as the failure to meet family\r\nobligations, the abuse of corporal punishment and the\r\nabuse of children or of any members of the family, as\r\nwell as penalties against the perpetrators of crimes against\r\nthe moral values of families and crimes that threaten the\r\nexistence of the family.\r\nThe green Charter on Human Rights adopted by the\r\nPeoples’ Congress in June 1988 includes a number of\r\narticles concerning the importance of the family and the\r\nneed to protect it, in the interests of the individual and of\r\nsociety. In paragraph 20, it provides that it is one of\r\nman’s sacred rights to grow up in a family of father,\r\nmother and siblings. Article 25 of the Law on the\r\nPromotion of Liberty provides for the right of every\r\nindividual citizen to form a family.\r\nIt is truly ironic that while celebrating the year\r\ndeclared by the Assembly as the International Year of the\r\nFamily, the Libyan family and Libyan society should\r\nsuffer from international sanctions imposed by one of the\r\norgans of this very Organization, namely the Security\r\nCouncil. Those sanctions have led to grave human\r\nsuffering to Libyan families owing to the lack of\r\nmedicines and of possibilities of treatment, which led to\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nthe delay in vaccinating thousands of children and the death\r\nof a number of those awaiting permission to go abroad for\r\ntreatment. Entire families have been lost because of road\r\naccidents, roads having become the main means of transport\r\nin the country. All this befell the Libyan family while\r\nLibya has been celebrating the International Year of the\r\nFamily! We appeal to this august Assembly immediately to\r\nlift these unjust, unjustifiable sanctions.\r\nThe suffering of the Libyan family came as a result of\r\nthe political hegemony of certain States on this international\r\nOrganization. They have not stopped there. Indeed, they are\r\nattempting through this Organization and other international\r\nforums and meetings to impose their culture and values on\r\nother nations and cultures, including the imposition of\r\nrather strange forms of the family unit which are\r\nunacceptable to societies and cultures that are much older\r\nand which cannot accept that any State or culture has the\r\nright to try and impose itself and its culture on other\r\npeoples.\r\nFinally, my country hopes that the International Year\r\nof the Family and the present discussion will be the start of\r\nan effort to promote and protect the family from dislocation\r\nand disintegration, so that we may create a happy, humane\r\nsociety in which peoples would cooperate in fraternity,\r\npeace and equality.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nSocial and Women’s Affairs of Cameroon, Mrs. Yaou\r\nAissatou, upon whom I now call.\r\nMrs. Aissatou (Cameroon) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Speaking on behalf of the Republic of Cameroon\r\nat this important International Conference on Families, I am\r\npleased and proud to note that the Conference affords us an\r\nopportunity to restore the human person to a central,\r\nrightful place in the development process.\r\nThat said, I should like to begin by thanking\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, for\r\nhaving decided to organize this special gathering devoted to\r\nfamilies and for having incorporated it into the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI should also like to express our appreciation to\r\nMr. Henryk Sakolski, Coordinator of the permanent\r\nsecretariat of the International Year of the Family, and all\r\nhis team for the effective manner in which they are\r\nsupervising the events marking the celebration of the Year.\r\nI should also like to join previous speakers in\r\nextending very sincere congratulations to the President\r\nand other officers of the Conference on their well-\r\ndeserved election and to assure them of our full\r\ncooperation in successfully completing our work.\r\nIn Cameroon the family, whatever form it may take\r\nas a result of the socio-cultural outlook of local\r\ncommunities, is viewed as the basic unit of society.\r\nWhether monogamous or polygamous, nuclear, extended\r\nor single-parent, the family in Cameroon has as its\r\nfundamental purpose providing the first milieu for the\r\nsocialization of the child. Under the Constitution, the\r\nState has the duty to protect and promote the family so\r\nthat it can play a useful part in implementing national\r\npopulation policy, whose ultimate goal is the promotion\r\nof a quality population by safeguarding the health of\r\nmother and child.\r\nA study on the Cameroon family carried out in 1988,\r\nwith the financial support of the World Bank, enabled us\r\nto identify the major challenges facing the family in my\r\ncountry. Foremost among them is poverty, the greatest\r\nobstacle to the family’s assuming with dignity its basic\r\nsocio-educational, health and economic functions and\r\npractising family planning. The family’s role has been\r\nenhanced recently by the implementation of structural\r\nadjustment programmes, which have been extended to\r\nsocial strata that in 1986 could be said to have risen\r\nabove the poverty line.\r\nA second challenge is the breakdown of value\r\nsystems, a result of the cultural shock created by the\r\nconflict between tradition and modernity. This is a\r\nfundamental problem, gradually becoming more acute\r\nwith the development of a global culture created by the\r\ngrowth of mass media and modern systems of\r\ncommunication and telecommunication.\r\nThose challenges, along with many others, affect the\r\nstructure and functioning of the family in Cameroon, with\r\nthe following consequences: first, a progressive\r\nweakening of the institution of marriage as the basic\r\nelement of the fundamental family unit; secondly, a\r\nmarked weakening of the bonds of family unity and of\r\nthe social control hitherto exercised over its members,\r\nparticularly the children, by adults — in this case,\r\nparents.\r\nThe study, along with others on poverty, has enabled\r\nthe Cameroon Government to improve its strategy for\r\neducating the people on responsible parenting. That\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nstrategy, drawn up in the framework of the national\r\npopulation policy and implemented through social centres,\r\nis designed to improve family function by educating\r\nindividuals, couples and communities on family living,\r\nsexual life, family planning and community living for\r\ndevelopment. It has also enabled us to target various\r\npolicies to reduce poverty, to make the family the true\r\nfoundation of social stability and national integration and to\r\nreach a better understanding of the place of women in\r\nvarious development programmes.\r\nThe family code now being drawn up will, when\r\nadopted, provide a more solid legal basis for this strategy\r\nso that the family in our society will become the special\r\nplace in which ideals of human development can be formed\r\nand take root.\r\nCameroon is pleased that since the New York Summit\r\nfor Children in 1990 the health of mothers and children has\r\nbecome — more than in the past — a concern of the\r\ninternational community, even if my country regrets the\r\nlack of additional resources from agencies on the system in\r\nsupport of programmes in this area.\r\nThe United Nations initiative to declare 1994 the\r\nInternational Year of the Family and to organize this\r\nConference on Families only a few months before the\r\nCopenhagen World Summit for Social Development has a\r\ntwofold significance for us.\r\nOn one hand, this initiative strengthens our conviction\r\nthat all forms of sustainable human development that seek\r\nto promote the comprehensive well-being of man and his\r\noffspring must necessarily reflect the family as the basic\r\nunit of society. On the other hand, it strengthens in us the\r\nidea that the advancement of family well-being requires the\r\npromotion of the various components of the family unit —\r\nthe father, the mother and the child.\r\nThe results of widespread social mobilization around\r\nthe theme of the family during 1994 and the\r\nrecommendations of the present Conference on Families are\r\npreparing the platform that we should like to see given to\r\nthe family at the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nThe approach of sustainable human development is\r\ntoday challenging the entire international community. A\r\nvision of development focusing solely on economics has led\r\nto many failures and frustrations and, thereby, demonstrated\r\nits limitations. From this forum we should welcome the\r\nUnited Nations initiative, undertaken since 1990, to issue\r\nthe human development index for each country. That index,\r\nbecause it is the product of economic and social\r\nindicators, is a better reflection of a country’s state of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nDespite socio-economic difficulties in our countries,\r\nfamilies continue to be the last refuge for many of their\r\nmembers — a place where those people can still hope to\r\nrediscover the meaning of humanity and a real spirit of\r\nsolidarity. Those two values are particularly lacking in\r\ninterpersonal relations today. We believe that a form of\r\ndevelopment focused on the advancement of the family\r\nwill make it possible to restore them and, through the\r\ndynamic of the family, will help to reintroduce them into\r\nthe community as a whole as a means of reorienting\r\nnational and international development by putting it on a\r\nfoundation that is more respectful of mankind and of the\r\nwhole person.\r\nThe consensus that is taking shape at the\r\ninternational level on the need to replace economic\r\ndevelopment with human development; the keen interest\r\nthat the international community is showing in issues\r\npertaining to children, women, the family, protection of\r\nthe environment, human rights and issues of governance;\r\nand the conviction of the need for solidarity, the clearest\r\nproof of which is the end of East-West antagonism —\r\nthese are all gains in the international context that give us\r\nhope that we can believe in development with a human\r\nface through transfers of resources released as part of the\r\npeace dividend to programmes aimed at reducing poverty\r\nand strengthening the family.\r\nWe must make it possible for the family to realize\r\nits full human potential so that that hope may become a\r\nreality.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the\r\nrepresentative of the Syrian Arab Republic, Mr. Abdu\r\nHadid, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Abdu Hadid (Syrian Arab Republic)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): It is a great pleasure for my\r\ndelegation to see such a host of distinguished\r\nrepresentatives celebrating the International Year of the\r\nFamily. This attests to the extreme importance of the\r\nfamily as the principal building block of society and of\r\nthe international community at large.\r\nI should like, on behalf of the Syrian Arab Republic,\r\nto give a brief overview of the activities and plans of\r\naction adopted by my country in celebration of the\r\nInternational Year with a view to bolstering the ethical,\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\ncultural, humanitarian and social values which underlie the\r\nfamily institution. I should like also to quote the wise\r\nwords of President Hafiz al-Assad:\r\n“When interaction and integration are fully achieved\r\nbetween man’s endeavours within the family and\r\nman’s productivity at work, then we are on the\r\nthreshold of a new stage of social development.”\r\nThe National Committee set up by my country to plan\r\nand coordinate activities for the International Year of the\r\nFamily, in cooperation with the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund, has organized a number of national seminars, and it\r\nhas adopted several recommendations related to the health,\r\neducational, social, legislative and information fields, in\r\nkeeping with authentic Arab principles and values, which\r\ndignify and protect the family as the basic cell of human\r\nsociety.\r\nProtection of the family is the joint responsibility of\r\nthe family itself, the State and society. Parents have very\r\nspecific responsibilities — protection of the family and\r\ncaring for its members; avoidance of the causes of family\r\ndisintegration; and abstention from the practice of any kind\r\nof gender discrimination against any family member, one\r\npurpose of which is to ensure that sons and daughters are\r\ngiven equal educational opportunities to enable them to\r\ndevelop appropriately.\r\nOn the other hand, the State and society at large have\r\nto endeavour, by various means, to protect the family\r\nagainst weakness and disintegration.\r\nFirst, by creating the appropriate social, economic,\r\nlegislative and psychological conditions that would enable\r\nthe family to continue to play its proper role;\r\nSecondly, by adopting appropriate policies to ensure\r\nthe cohesion and stability of the family in order for it to\r\ninteract positively with the objectives of development, while\r\navoiding excessive consumerism;\r\nThirdly, by offering more assistance, support and\r\nprotection to the family, especially in the remote areas,\r\nthrough the provision of high-quality development-oriented\r\nsocial services. The phenomenon of delinquency could be\r\navoided through the adoption of the well-known\r\nmechanisms of social defence.\r\nProceeding from these principles and beliefs, allow me\r\nto convey to you the most important recommendations\r\nadopted and implemented:\r\nAt the level of health care, increasing the number of\r\nprimary health programmes so as to make them accessible\r\nto each and every member of the family, in the context of\r\nthe overall objective of “health for all by the year 2000”;\r\nfurther expansion of preventive health services and\r\nmedical treatment, as well as protection of children and\r\nmothers; increasing support for grassroots and private\r\norganizations so that they may play their roles in\r\npromoting family awareness, especially in the area of\r\nfamily planning; and lastly, increasing the awareness of\r\nthe family as to the dangers of drugs, AIDS and other\r\ndiseases, and as to how one can protect the family and its\r\nmembers from such ills.\r\nAt the educational level, we have decided to adopt\r\nan integrated educational approach, that ensures full\r\ninteraction between the family itself, school and society,\r\nin order to prepare the present generations for the future.\r\nWe have decided also to expand our illiteracy campaigns\r\nbeyond mere literacy or numeracy, and have focused\r\nprimarily on parents, in order to eradicate all forms of\r\nilliteracy at the educational, social, economic and cultural\r\nlevels. We have decided to carry out field studies to\r\nhighlight the important role played by parents in the\r\neducation of their children, especially their daughters; and\r\nhave decided to prepare guides for parents explaining how\r\nto deal with their children and orienting them\r\neducationally, socially and in terms of health. At least one\r\npractical lesson per week will focus on the upbringing of\r\nchildren under the supervision of health-care specialists\r\nand social workers.\r\nAt the social level, we decided to increase the\r\nprotection offered by the State to the family so as to\r\nsatisfy the family’s basic needs and provide it with social\r\nguarantees so that it may be able to bring up its children\r\nproperly and, thereby, to contribute to the building and\r\ndevelopment of society. Efforts will be redoubled towards\r\nthe formulation of plans that would help families achieve\r\nsocial stability and raise their standards of living through\r\nexpanded social services, especially in low-income and\r\nrural areas. Social services provided to various families\r\nwill be expanded through the creation of new social\r\ninstitutions, consultation and guidance centres. The\r\nnumber of nurseries and kindergartens operated by\r\nGovernment and popular institutions is being increased.\r\nThe needs of mothers at home are being provided in order\r\nfor them to participate more fully in the process of\r\ndevelopment. Appropriate technology in rural areas is\r\nintroduced at a much larger scale in order to increase\r\nagricultural production for local consumption and to\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nimprove living standards in the rural areas, thereby\r\nimproving conditions on the whole.\r\nAt the legislative level, we encouraged more support\r\nfor the role of the family in solving its own problems,\r\nupdating national legislation whenever necessary in keeping\r\nwith social and economic development policies and with an\r\neye to achieving sustainable development. We also updated\r\nfamily legislation in Syria in keeping with changed national\r\ncircumstances, both at the social and economic levels.\r\nIn the area of information, we have focused on the\r\nimportance of mass media in educating the family and\r\nincreasing its awareness. To this end, we have adopted very\r\nclear information policies to protect the family and its\r\nmembers from delinquency.\r\nAllow me to convey the recommendation made by the\r\nSyrian National Committee for the International Year of the\r\nFamily, supporting the proposal adopted by the Arab\r\nConference on Human Rights, held in Cairo at the\r\nbeginning of this year, namely, to change the date of the\r\ncelebration of the International Day of the Family to a date\r\nother than 15 May, because 15 May coincides with a very\r\npainful date in the history of our Arab nation.\r\nFinally, I would call upon all of you to support the\r\nprincipal nucleus of our society, the family, because\r\nprotecting the family means protecting and ensuring the\r\nsafety of human society as a whole.\r\nThe President: I call now on the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Brazil, Mr. Ronaldo Sardenberg.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil): At the outset, I wish to\r\nindicate that the delegation of Brazil fully subscribes to the\r\nstatement made today by the Permanent Representative of\r\nParaguay on behalf of the Group of Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nadd a few remarks to specify the Brazilian perspective on\r\nthe International Year of the Family.\r\nThese are times of extraordinary change: the\r\nglobalization of the world economy, the quick access to\r\ninformation, the growing rhythm of urbanization, as well as\r\nthe increasing awareness that events in different areas of\r\nthe globe can affect the standards of living of societies\r\nthousands of kilometres apart, all these phenomena affect\r\nthe family.\r\nThrough the ages the family has played a role in the\r\nprocess of socialization and education, the paramount\r\nimportance of which need not be further emphasized.\r\nToday the family is coming to grips with the challenge of\r\nhaving to adapt quickly to an ever-changing environment.\r\nIt is not immune to the new economic, social and cultural\r\nrealities.\r\nThe viability of our societies in the future and the\r\nwell-being of our descendants will depend on our ability\r\nto cope with this process of adaptation directly, so as to\r\navoid a possible trend towards the disintegration of the\r\nfamily structure.\r\nThe role of family life in society is manifold. It is at\r\nthe family level that solutions can be found to many of\r\nthe social ills of our times. Because it is the core structure\r\nin society, it retains potential as a fundamental tool in the\r\nformulation and implementation of policies in areas such\r\nas education, health, and sanitation.\r\nGiven these challenges and possibilities, we consider\r\nit entirely appropriate that the international community\r\nand the United Nations should devote significant efforts\r\nto addressing issues of concern to the family. Brazil\r\njoined the consensus that resulted in resolution 44/82,\r\nlaunching the International Year of the Family, aimed at\r\npromoting increased awareness of family issues and at\r\nimproving the institutional capability of countries to\r\ntackle family-related problems with comprehensive\r\npolicies.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nFrom the standpoint of public policies, it is\r\nimportant to stress that a fragmented approach to family\r\nissues — children, youth, the elderly and disabled\r\npersons, for instance — does not necessarily provide the\r\nresponse required by the family unit in permanent\r\ninteraction. Public policies aimed at specific segments of\r\nthe population cannot fail to consider the concrete living\r\nconditions and survival strategies of family groupings,\r\nwhich vary according to their position within the social\r\nstructure.\r\nThe Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988 dedicates\r\nan entire chapter to the family. It establishes the basic\r\nframework for family-related policies. Our Constitution\r\nconsiders the family as the basis of society, and provides\r\nfor special protection and support by the State. The\r\nfamily, together with the State, bears primary\r\nresponsibility for respect for the rights of the child and\r\nthe adolescent.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nSix years have elapsed since the promulgation of the\r\nBrazilian Constitution, which can claim the status of a legal\r\nlandmark on its handling of family issues. The passing of\r\nother important pieces of legislation in Brazil also deserve\r\nto be mentioned. They include the Statute of the Child and\r\nAdolescent, the Organic Law for Social Assistance and the\r\nNational Policy on Ageing. There remains, however, a\r\nsignificant gap between the law and the reality faced by\r\nfamilies in Brazil. Government and society alike are doing\r\ntheir utmost to bridge this gap in order to allow all families\r\nto enjoy the benefits of social and economic development.\r\nIn order to carry out the activities pursuant to the\r\nInternational Year of the Family, an Interministerial\r\nCommittee was established by President Itamar Franco for\r\nthe formulation of Brazilian policy on the family. In\r\nSeptember a debate was conducted in Brasilia on the\r\nNational Plan for the Brazilian Family.\r\nThe Brazilian National Plan sets the principles and\r\nstrategies for our national policy in this domain, defining\r\nareas of responsibility of the various Ministries. The\r\nnational policy will be coordinated, at the federal level, by\r\na permanent commission composed of 10 Government\r\nrepresentatives and 10 representatives of interested non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. The Commission also includes\r\nrepresentatives of the States of the federation and of\r\nmunicipalities.\r\nThe main guidelines of this Plan include participation\r\nof the family in the formulation, implementation, follow-up\r\nand assessment of Government policies and programmes;\r\nrespect for social and cultural diversity; and the need for\r\nappropriate funding at all Government levels to finance\r\nactivities related to the family.\r\nIn 1992 Brazil hosted one of the international meetings\r\naimed at discussing special chapters of the Declaration on\r\nthe Rights of Families, which is scheduled to be launched\r\nin December this year, in the context of the initiatives\r\npromoted by the International Union of Family\r\nOrganizations. The meeting in Brazil was an important\r\npreparatory event where topics regarding the economic\r\nrights of the family were discussed.\r\nOn behalf of the Brazilian delegation, I would like\r\nalso to stress the importance of the Declaration of\r\nCartagena, issued by the Latin American and Caribbean\r\nRegional Meeting in preparation for the International Year\r\nof the Family. Among many relevant points, the\r\nDeclaration states the willingness of the countries of the\r\nregion to\r\n“transform the family into a prime agent of\r\nprogrammes aimed at specific population\r\ngroups, incorporating the dimensions of gender,\r\nage, status, ethnic origin and level of\r\nvulnerability.” (LC/G.1777(CONF.84/5, p. 31))\r\nThe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, in which Brazil participated constructively,\r\ndedicated one chapter of its Programme of Action to the\r\ndiversity of family structures and composition and the\r\nrequired socio-economic support. The Programme of\r\nAction recognizes that the process of worldwide rapid\r\ndemographic and socio-economic changes has influenced\r\npatterns of family formation and family life, thus\r\ngenerating considerable change in family composition and\r\nstructure. It also admits that widespread migration caused\r\nby conflicts, urbanization, poverty and natural disasters\r\nhas placed great strains on the family. Governments\r\nshould take these realities into consideration when\r\nformulating socio-economic development policies,\r\nprogrammes and legislation aiming at contributing to the\r\nstability of families. Families are increasingly vulnerable.\r\nSingle-parent families headed by women, poor families\r\nwith elderly members, refugee and displaced families,\r\namong others, deserve special attention.\r\nThe Cairo Programme of Action recommends that\r\nGovernments should provide the necessary support and\r\nprotection for these most vulnerable families. They should\r\nalso formulate family-sensitive policies in the areas of\r\nhealth, education, employment, housing and social\r\nsecurity.\r\nMy Government is committed to implement\r\nprogrammes and actions recommended by the Cairo\r\nConference, and is considering an entire set of measures\r\nfocused on the family. We are motivated by the\r\nrealization that this basic institution must receive\r\ncomprehensive support.\r\nIn concluding, I would like to emphasize that the\r\nenormous tasks ahead of us concerning family issues must\r\ngain proper international attention throughout the United\r\nNations system as well as other institutions, especially\r\nthose dedicated to the promotion of social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\naccordance with the decision taken yesterday afternoon,\r\nI now call on the Observer of the Holy See, His\r\nEminence Alfonso Cardinal Lopez Trujillo, President of\r\nthe Pontifical Council for the Family.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nCardinal Lopez Trujillo (Holy See) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): Thank you very much, Mr. President, for\r\nthis opportunity that is offered to the Holy See.\r\nThis meeting is taking place in the International Year\r\nof the Family, proclaimed by the United Nations and\r\ncelebrated by the Catholic Church in the various nations of\r\nthe world with particular enthusiasm.\r\nIn Rome, on 8 and 9 October, significant events took\r\nplace in connection with the World Meeting of Families\r\nwith Pope John Paul II, when an immense multitude — like\r\na sea into which abundant tributaries flowed — of nearly\r\n200,000 pilgrims from almost every country in the world\r\nfilled St. Peter’s Square.\r\nThis celebration was preceded by numerous activities\r\ncarried out in all countries, showing the vitality of the\r\nfamily. The Rome meeting with the Pope was thus a\r\ndemonstration of hope placed in the energies of the family,\r\nbased on marriage as a community of life and love,\r\ncharacterized by the reciprocal self-giving of a man and a\r\nwoman, a husband and wife, in a free and stable — until\r\ndeath — responsible way that is open to life. Children are\r\nindeed God’s most precious gift to marriage.\r\nIn the Catholic Church the Charter of the Rights of the\r\nFamily, prepared by the Holy See, is the instrument that\r\nhas been used as the basis for work and dialogue. It\r\nincorporates the principal aspects of and points on the\r\nmatter, based on a rich conception of fundamental human\r\nrights, because the rights of the family are a systematic\r\nmanifestation and application of the natural law in reference\r\nto the family community, the vital foundation of society.\r\nDuring this Year it has been possible to study in depth\r\nwhat the family entails as the vital basis of society and to\r\ndraw the consequences for both the personal and social\r\nspheres and for the life of humanity in the network of the\r\nhuman family. It would not be logical or coherent to state\r\nand recognize that the family is the basic unit of the social\r\nfabric and then to deny or weaken its status as a true social\r\nsubject, with its own particular sovereignty, rights and\r\nduties.\r\nPope John Paul II refers to these vital themes in his\r\nrich Letter to Families, his gift to the human family on the\r\noccasion of this International Year.\r\nAt a recent meeting in Rome with many families from\r\nall around the world we were able to verify the deep\r\nconvergence between the most varied religions regarding\r\nthe fundamental values of the family. It could not be\r\notherwise, for the family is the heritage of mankind\r\nthrough which the future of society on our planet\r\nnecessarily passes.\r\nIt is very important to bring together similar\r\nmanifestations in the cultural heritage of our peoples. In\r\nthe Nichomachaen Ethics we can read the following\r\nreflections:\r\n“Friendship between husband and wife is\r\nrecognized; it is natural; in fact, by nature, man is\r\nmore inclined to live as a couple than to associate\r\npolitically, because the family is something prior to,\r\nand more necessary than, the State”.\r\n(Nichomachaen Ethics, VIII, 15-20)\r\nThis text, as is well known, was written 350 years before\r\nChrist by Aristotle.\r\nThroughout history attempts have been made to\r\ndefend and to help the family community, in which the\r\ngood of the spouses, the children and society is ensured.\r\nI do not wish to dwell on this aspect for too long, but\r\nwhat would be the future of children, their harmonious\r\ndevelopment, their upbringing in the sense of an integral\r\neducation, and their dynamic and positive inclusion in\r\nsociety, if they were not born and raised in a family, as\r\na responsible union of hearts under one roof, as we see it\r\nin the United Nations symbol for the International Year\r\nof the Family? Are not the strength of the family and its\r\nprotection the best guarantee for respecting children, in\r\naccordance with the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild?\r\nChildren are the first victims of instability and\r\nerosion. They are innocent victims, who have the right to\r\ntheir parents’ generous and self-sacrificing love, their\r\nexample, and an education of which their parents’\r\nbehaviour is a necessary condition.\r\nToday all kinds of very high social costs are being\r\npaid, either because millions of children do not have\r\nfamilies or, as the Pope says, because they are like\r\norphans with living parents.\r\nIn this International Year we are called upon to\r\nconfirm and implement, as is appropriate and necessary,\r\none fundamental principle: the family based on marriage\r\nis a value proper to this natural institution, willed by God,\r\nand inscribed in the depths of human nature. It is a value,\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nI repeat, as the Second Vatican Council notes, for spouses,\r\nchildren and society.\r\nThe family is not a private matter and situation; it has\r\nsocial importance that is not derived from any concessions\r\nor generosity of the State. We have had occasion to\r\nobserve, on the one hand, what some nations have\r\nachieved, and on the other, a systematic emptying of family\r\npolicies and legislation worthy only of the name in many\r\ncountries. A number of documents of the International Year\r\nrefer to the requirement to deal with this.\r\nAn adequate family policy requires that the family be\r\nrecognized and helped as a social subject, one that\r\nintegrates each and every one of its members — the man\r\nand woman, husband and wife, sons and daughters, babies,\r\nyouth, the elderly, the healthy and the sick.\r\nWe have been able to work more vigorously for the\r\nmembers of the family who also deserve appropriate\r\nassistance of a social nature that is in harmony with, and\r\nnot in opposition to the family as an integrating body or\r\ncommunity.\r\nTogether with the repeated desire for real recognition\r\nof the rights of the family and necessary positive family\r\nlegislation, to which Pope John Paul II and the Catholic\r\nChurch are very committed, I should like to express the\r\nhope for a decisive, enthusiastic and universal defence of\r\nthe family by those who govern. If they act in this manner\r\nthey will be encouraging harmony with the good of the\r\nfamily, society and the common good, which must be\r\nensured for all mankind.\r\nDuring the preparatory process for the International\r\nConference on Population and Development, held in Cairo,\r\nHis Holiness the Pope expressed concern regarding the\r\ntreatment of the traditional form of the family. The Holy\r\nSee is pleased to note that in the principles of the Cairo\r\ndocument, the basis for interpreting and understanding the\r\nwhole text it is clearly stated in principle 9 that\r\n“the family is the basic unit of society and as such\r\nshould be strengthened. It is entitled to receive\r\ncomprehensive protection and support.”\r\nThe same principle goes on to say:\r\n“Marriage must be entered into with the free consent\r\nof the intending spouses, and husband and wife should\r\nbe equal partners.”\r\nThat principle must inspire all family policy and any true\r\ndemographic policy.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Henryk\r\nSakolski, the Coordinator of the International Year of the\r\nFamily, who was with us at the World Meeting of\r\nFamilies with the Pope, for the diploma he gave me\r\ndesignating the Pontifical Council for the Family as a co-\r\nsponsor of this International Year.\r\nFinally, I transmit the paternal and hopeful greetings\r\nto all assembled here — and their families — from Pope\r\nJohn Paul II, the Pope of the family, the Pope of life.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nGeneral Assembly has thus concluded this International\r\nConference on Families devoted to the implementation of\r\nthe follow-up of the International Year of the Family.\r\nI should like to thank all the high-ranking individuals\r\nand the non-governmental organizations that have come\r\nto the United Nations Headquarters in New York to\r\nexpress their view of the importance of the family in the\r\nworld today. We hope that this enterprise will be\r\ncontinued.\r\nAgenda item 152\r\nObserver status for the International Federation of\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies in the General\r\nAssembly: draft resolution (A/49/L.3)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\non the representative of Australia to introduce the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/49/L.3.\r\nMr. Rowe (Australia): It is my honour to introduce,\r\non behalf of the sponsors, the draft resolution contained\r\nin document A/49/L.3 of 17 October 1994, by which the\r\nGeneral Assembly would invite the International\r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to\r\nparticipate in the sessions and the work of the General\r\nAssembly in the capacity of Observer.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nThe 100 Member States which sponsored this draft\r\nresolution are listed in document A/49/L.3. To these should\r\nbe added Albania, Azerbaijan, Chad, China, Comoros,\r\nDominica, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Italy, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania,\r\nNicaragua, Niger, Paraguay, Republic of Moldova,\r\nSlovenia, South Africa, Spain, Suriname, Tajikistan, The\r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Trinidad and\r\nTobago, Turkmenistan, Uganda, United Republic of\r\nTanzania and Viet Nam, making a total of 129 sponsors.\r\nThe basis on which the International Federation is\r\nseeking Observer status in the General Assembly is\r\ncontained in the explanatory memorandum in document\r\nA/49/192. The sponsors wish to draw the attention of the\r\nmembers of the General Assembly to the following points\r\nin particular.\r\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies (formerly the League of Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent Societies), founded in 1919, is the federation\r\nof 162 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\r\nthroughout the world. It acts under its own Constitution\r\nwith all the rights and obligations of a corporate body with\r\na legal personality. Its secretariat is based in Geneva.\r\nA recent survey established that the member societies\r\nof the Federation together represent some 127 million\r\nvolunteer members, with approximately 270,000 employed\r\nstaff.\r\nIn accordance with its Constitution, the Federation is\r\nthe official representative of its member societies in the\r\ninternational field, the guardian of their integrity and the\r\nprotector of their interests.\r\nThe functions of the Federation, endorsed by States\r\nwhen they adopt the Statutes of the International Red Cross\r\nand Red Crescent Movement, are, inter alia: to bring relief\r\nby all available means to all disaster victims; to organize,\r\ncoordinate and direct international relief actions and to\r\nassist the national societies in their disaster relief\r\npreparedness; to bring help to victims of armed conflicts in\r\naccordance with the agreements concluded by the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross; to encourage and\r\npromote in every country the establishment and\r\ndevelopment of an independent and duly recognized\r\nnational society; and to carry out the mandates entrusted to\r\nit by the International Conference of the Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent, which brings together Governments and the\r\nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent movement.\r\nWith an average of well over 400 delegates working\r\nin 12 regional and 53 country delegations, the Federation\r\nsecretariat, with the support of its member societies that\r\nprovide the major part of the funds, relief consignments\r\nand personnel, has been active in 1994 throughout the\r\nworld, providing assistance to victims of disasters and\r\nsustaining development programmes.\r\nIn 1994, programmes coordinated through the\r\nInternational Federation are assisting 19.2 million\r\nbeneficiaries in Africa, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and\r\nthe Americas.\r\nIn addition to these emergencies-related programmes,\r\nmillions of others are assisted through national activities\r\nranging from disaster preparedness, maternal and child\r\nhealth, first aid, women and development, youth and\r\nsocial programmes aimed, in particular, at improving the\r\nsituation of those who are most vulnerable.\r\nThe agenda and tasks of the Federation and the\r\nUnited Nations increasingly complement one another and\r\ninteract with increasing frequency.\r\nA particularly close cooperation has over the years\r\nevolved with the World Health Organization, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Population\r\nFund, the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees and the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs. The creation of the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs has given particular focus to the\r\nhumanitarian agenda within the central United Nations\r\norgans. The role and functions of the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs are today of direct relevance to the\r\nmandates of the Economic and Social Council, as well as\r\nto those of the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil. The Federation, having been invited, together\r\nwith the International Committee of the Red Cross, to\r\nparticipate in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, could\r\nmake an enhanced contribution, through the provision of\r\nadvice and expertise, to these United Nations organs as\r\nthey strive for effective coordination of humanitarian\r\nrelief, if it were to be granted observer status.\r\nMoreover, the International Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Movement practises a close cooperation between\r\nits components both in the field and at the secretariat\r\nlevel. It would be beneficial to the General Assembly to\r\nincrease the effectiveness of the Movement as a whole by\r\nadmitting the Federation as an Observer, thereby\r\ncomplementing the contribution of the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross in terms of its different\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nmandate, as well as of its know-how and operational\r\ncapacity.\r\nThe Federation has a specificity similar to that of the\r\nUnited Nations in building its membership on the principle\r\nof one country — one member. Both promote universality\r\nas a leading principle. The Federation is an international\r\norganization composed of member societies, the unique\r\ncharacter and mandate of which has been defined, at the\r\nnational as well as the international level, by nearly all the\r\nStates that are also the very Members of the United\r\nNations. This represents, both in substance and in structure,\r\na unique position in the international community.\r\nAs a humanitarian organization which is involved\r\nglobally, on a huge scale, in disaster-relief operations as\r\nwell as day-to-day health and social programmes, the\r\nFederation considers that it would be important and\r\nmutually beneficial to have the opportunity to participate as\r\nan Observer in the work of the General Assembly when\r\npolicy on humanitarian issues is being developed and\r\ndiscussed. In addition, Federation observer status in the\r\nGeneral Assembly would be of mutual benefit to the two\r\norganizations and above all to disaster victims, as it would\r\nfurther strengthen the communications and operational\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Federation.\r\nThe special and unique features outlined above and in\r\nthe explanatory memorandum and the shared common\r\nhumanitarian task of the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\r\nSocieties provide strong justification for according the\r\nFederation observer status.\r\nAccordingly, on behalf of the 129 sponsors,\r\nrepresenting in numbers over two thirds of the membership\r\nof the United Nations, and in geographical terms all the\r\nregions of the world, I request that the General Assembly\r\nadopt the draft resolution, which would grant observer\r\nstatus for the International Federation of Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent Societies in the General Assembly.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Gambia, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the African States.\r\nMr. Jallow (Gambia): On behalf of the African Group\r\nof States and of my own delegation of the Gambia, I have\r\nthe pleasure to express our support for draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.3 on observer status for the International Federation\r\nof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies has over the years proved its universal\r\nvigilance in quickly reacting to emergency situations all\r\nover the world. The nature and extent of the Federation’s\r\nactivities, which cover every facet of our lives, either\r\ndirectly or indirectly, have continued to receive\r\ninternational acclaim.\r\nThe universality of the work of the Federation is\r\ncomplemented by the international nature of its\r\nmembership, drawn from 162 countries. The organization\r\nhas therefore been working closely with relevant United\r\nNations agencies in the field of humanitarian activities.\r\nThe Federation has played a heroic humanitarian role in\r\nconflict areas and disaster situations, which have\r\ncontinued to grow in number and frequency in recent\r\nyears. Sometimes the severity and complexity of the\r\nconflict or disaster situation make these tasks not only\r\ndaunting, but dangerous. This notwithstanding, the\r\nFederation has continued, guided by its overriding\r\nprinciples of neutrality and impartiality, its uninterrupted\r\nservice to humankind, bringing its healing powers to the\r\nmillions of victims — maimed and often homeless — of\r\nwars and natural disasters.\r\nIt is in recognition of these attributes and\r\nachievements of the Federation, its adherence to the basic\r\ntenets of the Charter of the United Nations and its\r\nwillingness to serve whenever and wherever necessary\r\nthroughout the world, that we recommend the adoption by\r\nconsensus of the draft resolution before us, in order to\r\nmake it possible for us to welcome the International\r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to\r\nparticipation in the sessions and work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Mongbe (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nBenin, on whose behalf I have the honour to speak, is\r\nhonoured that its name appeared on the impressive list of\r\ncountries which joined in signing the letter requesting the\r\ninclusion of agenda item 152 on the agenda of this\r\nsession and that it is a sponsor of draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.3, which would grant the International Federation\r\nof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies observer status\r\nin the General Assembly.\r\nIt is no secret that the Federation is the largest and\r\nbest-known humanitarian organization in the world, with\r\nits 162 member national societies, which their respective\r\nGovernments find very useful and highly appreciate.\r\nSince the end of the First World War, the emblem of the\r\nFederation has been respected throughout the world for its\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nuniversality, neutrality, self-sacrifice and ability to prevent\r\nand mitigate the sufferings of the weakest, the most\r\nvulnerable and victims of every kind of atrocity.\r\nMy delegation endorses all the observations which my\r\nfriend, the Ambassador of Australia, has just made in his\r\neloquent introduction of the draft resolution before us, and\r\nthose made by Ambassador Jallow of Gambia, who has just\r\nspoken on behalf of the African Group.\r\nI would simply point out that, in addition to\r\nprogrammes involving coordinated emergency assistance by\r\nthe International Federation to 19.2 million beneficiaries in\r\nAfrica, Europe, Asia and America, national activities\r\ncovering many areas — disaster preparation, mother- and\r\nchild-care, blood transfusions, first aid, youth programmes\r\nand social programmes for vulnerable groups, such as the\r\nelderly, the sick and the infirm — all provide help to\r\nmillions of others.\r\nAt a time when the United Nations is becoming more\r\ndynamic in its humanitarian assistance through the creation\r\nand consolidation of the Department of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs, it would be advantageous to strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween the International Federation and the General\r\nAssembly and to broaden and enhance the Federation’s\r\nexisting relations with several specialized agencies of the\r\nworld Organization.\r\nMy delegation believes that the unique characteristics\r\nof the International Federation, which the representative of\r\nAustralia described a few moments ago, along with the\r\nhumanitarian tasks it shares with the United Nations, are\r\nsufficient to grant it observer status in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMy delegation praises the determination of all those\r\ndelegations which supported the Federation’s candidacy and\r\ncommends the spirit of cooperation of all the other\r\ndelegations which, hesitant at the outset of the process,\r\nagreed to negotiate with a view to finding a modus vivendi\r\nwith the former.\r\nAdmitting the International Federation of Red Cross\r\nand Red Crescent Societies to the General Assembly with\r\nobserver status will be a step forward towards dealing in a\r\nmore coordinated and thus effective manner with the many\r\nhumanitarian problems that so often defy the capacity and\r\ncredibility of our Organization.\r\nMr. Thanarajasingam (Malaysia): My delegation has\r\nconsistently supported the application of the International\r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for\r\nobserver status in the General Assembly. The agenda item\r\nwe are considering today is the culmination of the efforts\r\nof the international community to accord this status to the\r\nFederation.\r\nWe wish to underline that the Federation fully\r\ndeserves the status it is seeking. As the only international\r\norganization with representation by a large majority of\r\nGovernments and one that is governed by statutes drawn\r\nup by Governments and organizations, it fully deserves\r\nthe status that is being sought on its behalf by more than\r\n120 countries from all regions.\r\nWith this status, the International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies would be well placed\r\nto enhance its collaboration with the United Nations, the\r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies and the United\r\nNations sanctions Committee. Granting observer status to\r\nthe Federation would also facilitate and strengthen its\r\nability to network with target groups in providing urgently\r\nneeded humanitarian assistance.\r\nMr. President, my delegation wishes to record its\r\nappreciation of your personal involvement in resolving\r\nthis issue. The Permanent Representative of Australia\r\ndeserves our appreciation as well. We recall the problems\r\nencountered earlier, and we are happy that a consensus\r\nacceptable to all was eventually achieved.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to join Australia and\r\nthe other 127 sponsors in commending the draft resolution\r\nformally endorsing observer status for the Federation.\r\nMr. Kovanda (Czech Republic): Let me be brief\r\nand to the point.\r\nMy delegation chairs the Eastern European Group of\r\nStates this month, which is a great honour for us, but I\r\nam speaking here on behalf of my delegation only.\r\nThe Czech Republic is privileged to have co-\r\nsponsored draft resolution A/49/L.3, inviting the\r\nInternational Federation of the Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies to become a permanent observer in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We find the Federation unique; it has\r\nmembers in 162 countries, and another 23 national\r\nsocieties are expected to be recognized in coming years.\r\nOnce that happens, the Federation will have more\r\nmembers than our own United Nations, unless we take\r\ngreat care to “adopt” somebody else.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nHow much more universal can an organization actually\r\nbe? Statistics about its programme have been listed and\r\nmentioned by previous speakers, especially by the\r\nrepresentative of Australia, and I will not repeat them. We\r\ndo, however, note that just over half of the total number of\r\npeople who benefit from the assistance of the Federation\r\nare Europeans. Whether this is an appropriate proportion is\r\nanother matter, but being European ourselves, we\r\nacknowledge this fact with gratitude.\r\nThis is a humanitarian organization which is non-\r\nsectarian and universal, far closer in its spirit to the\r\nprinciples of a civic society — which are very dear to my\r\ncountry’s philosophy — than to the all too frequent recent\r\nmanifestations of ethnic hatred, religious intolerance and\r\nsectarian strife. We appreciate that observer status should\r\nnot be available even to worthy organizations as easily as\r\nbuns in a bakery, to quote a Czech metaphor, but we feel\r\nthat in this case we are talking about an organization that\r\nis not only unique, but truly deserving.\r\nWe feel that the International Federation of the Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies is so important that it is\r\nan honour for this General Assembly to benefit from the\r\nassociation that is about to take place. And if the Federation\r\nderives some use from its observer status with us, all the\r\nbetter.\r\nMr. Borda (Colombia) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI, too, shall be very brief.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to be among those that have\r\nsupported and sponsored draft resolution A/49/L.3, which\r\ninvites the International Federation of Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies to be a permanent observer in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The honour fell to my country, as\r\nrepresentative of the Group of 77 and of the People’s\r\nRepublic of China, to call last year for the inclusion of this\r\nitem on the agenda. We therefore support the views\r\nexpressed by the representative of Australia in introducing\r\nthe item today.\r\nThe Red Cross and the Red Crescent have, through\r\ntheir dogged and selfless cooperation at the international\r\nlevel, become well-established symbols of humanitarian\r\nassistance in aiding the victims of disasters, in addition to\r\nvictims of conflict, and assisting the neediest and most\r\nvulnerable. The International Federation of Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent Societies, established 75 years ago, is inspired\r\nby the same principles of struggle against human suffering.\r\nIts present expansion responds to changes in today’s world.\r\nThe considerable increase in the number of victims\r\nneeding aid as a result of natural disasters and grave\r\nsocial crises provides additional reason for the existence\r\nof the Federation, which coordinates the humanitarian\r\nactivities of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent at the\r\nglobal level. Moreover, the United Nations humanitarian\r\nprogramme includes many matters with which the\r\nInternational Federation is also concerned. These points\r\nof convergence fully justify observer status for the\r\nFederation.\r\nIt is therefore with special satisfaction that my\r\ndelegation will welcome the International Federation of\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies as a permanent\r\nObserver in the General Assembly.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): We\r\nshall now take a decision on draft resolution A/49/L.3.\r\nI should like to announce that the following\r\ncountries have become sponsors of the draft resolution:\r\nthe United Arab Emirates and Grenada.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/49/L.3?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 49/2).\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): Before\r\ncalling on representatives who wish to speak in\r\nexplanation of position, may I remind delegations that\r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Rosenstock (United States of America): Had\r\nthere been a vote on the question of granting observer\r\nstatus in the General Assembly to the International\r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, my\r\ndelegation would have abstained. There is a procedure for\r\nestablishing relationships between the United Nations and\r\nnon-governmental organizations. The procedure is rooted\r\nin Article 71 of the Charter, which reads in the relevant\r\npart:\r\n“The Economic and Social Council may make\r\nsuitable arrangements for consultation with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.”\r\nUnder that Article, and in compliance with it, a\r\ndetailed procedure has been established, pursuant to\r\nEconomic and Social Council resolution 1296 (XLIV).\r\nThe status of observers in the General Assembly should,\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nin accordance with past practice and consistent with the\r\nsense of Article 71 of the Charter, be reserved for States\r\nand intergovernmental organizations.\r\nIf we continue to depart from that long-standing\r\npractice because of intense lobbying by national societies,\r\nor in order to respond to a particular organization’s desire\r\nfor what it perceives as equal prestige, we will be departing\r\nfrom the scheme of the Charter. We are also putting in peril\r\nthe particular rights and privileges currently accorded to\r\nobservers in the General Assembly. It would certainly be\r\nregrettable if the rights and privileges accorded to observers\r\nrepresenting States and intergovernmental organizations had\r\nto be cut back to avoid jeopardizing the work of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe are pleased that there has been some recognition\r\nof these problems. The Assembly has decided to examine\r\nthe question of criteria for the granting of General\r\nAssembly observer status and has established a moratorium\r\non further granting of observer status until criteria are\r\nestablished. We are confident that the Sixth Committee,\r\nwhich has already begun its consideration of this matter,\r\nwill endorse criteria consistent with the Charter scheme that\r\nwill allow us to resume a rational handling of these matters.\r\nThe issue is not whether a given organization does\r\nenormous good work in the field of disaster relief, as the\r\nFederation surely does, or in the field of human rights or in\r\ncombating hunger. The issue is how the United Nations can\r\nbest recognize the special role of States and\r\nintergovernmental organizations and also continue to\r\nprovide suitable arrangements for consultation with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nMrs. Horiuchi (Japan): While we joined in the\r\nadoption without a vote of draft resolution A/49/L.3,\r\nentitled “Observer status for the International Federation of\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies in the General\r\nAssembly”, we would have abstained had it been put to the\r\nvote. Our delegation is of the same view as that just offered\r\nby the representative of the United States, namely, that,\r\nalthough we highly appreciate the activities of the\r\nFederation in the humanitarian field, observer status in the\r\nGeneral Assembly should basically be limited to non-\r\nMember States and intergovernmental organizations.\r\nIn this context, it should be remembered that the\r\nobserver status of the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross (ICRC) was conferred on an exceptional basis\r\nbecause of the ICRC’s clear mandate and specific\r\nresponsibilities under the Geneva Conventions. In this\r\nrespect, we welcome the initiative taken by the Permanent\r\nMission of the United States to establish a working group\r\nin the Sixth Committee to consider the question of criteria\r\nfor granting observer status in the General Assembly. We\r\nhope that such criteria will be devised before we consider\r\ngranting observer status to any other non-governmental\r\norganization.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\naccordance with resolution 45/6 of 16 October 1990, I\r\ncall on the observer for the International Committee of\r\nthe Red Cross.\r\nMr. Küng (International Committee of the Red\r\nCross): The United Nations has just granted the\r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\r\nSocieties the status of observer in the General Assembly.\r\nAs founder of the Red Cross and Red Crescent\r\nmovement, the International Committee of the Red Cross\r\n(ICRC), which was granted observer status four years\r\nago, warmly welcomes this decision, which pays tribute\r\nto the humanitarian activities carried out by the\r\nFederation over the past 75 years.\r\nSince its creation at the time of the Paris Peace\r\nConference following the First World War, the Federation\r\nhas steadily developed its assistance to victims of natural\r\nand technological disasters as well as to refugees and\r\nother civilians outside conflict areas. It has also invested\r\ngreat efforts in developing national Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent societies, whose humanitarian network covers\r\npractically all countries in the world today. Its new status\r\nwill strengthen the relationship and cooperation between\r\nthe Federation and the entire United Nations system and\r\nwill allow the Federation to be, within the General\r\nAssembly, an advocate for the victims of natural disasters,\r\nepidemics, hunger, poverty and underdevelopment — in\r\nshort, the most needy and vulnerable.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 19 October 1994\r\nFor its part, the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross will continue to plead for the victims of armed\r\nconflicts and internal strife, in accordance with the mandate\r\nreceived from the international community, in particular\r\nthrough the Geneva Conventions. We wish to take this\r\nopportunity to thank the General Assembly for its continued\r\nsupport and for recognizing the separate but complementary\r\nmandates of the Federation and the ICRC.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): May I\r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 152?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): When\r\nthis morning’s meeting was called to order eight out of\r\n184 delegations were represented in the Hall; this\r\nafternoon when we began at 3.10 p.m. there were 46\r\nrepresentatives present. Tomorrow morning’s meeting will\r\nbegin at 10 a.m. Many speakers are scheduled to speak\r\nand I hope that representatives will be in their places at\r\n10 o’clock.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.50 p.m.\r\n23\r\n"
