(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 12\r\nReport of the Economic and Social Council\r\nCommemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of\r\nthe operations of the United Nations Population\r\nFund: draft resolution A/49/L.5\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): This\r\nmorning, in accordance with the decision taken at its 3rd\r\nplenary meeting, the Assembly is commemorating the\r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the operations of the United\r\nNations Population Fund.In this connection, the Assembly\r\nhas before it at draft resolution which has been issued as\r\ndocument A/49/L.5.\r\nIt is an honour and a great pleasure for me to\r\nparticipate in the commemoration of the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA). The International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment at Cairo, which concluded its deliberations\r\nbarely a month ago, adopted an innovative Programme of\r\nAction and provided further proof of the Organization’s\r\ndevotion to and tradition of debate and open discussion of\r\nall views and perceptions of problems, in an atmosphere of\r\nmutual respect, until consensus is reached.\r\nIt is therefore only fitting that we congratulate\r\nourselves on the positive results of that Conference. Here,\r\nI should like to congratulate all the delegations that\r\nparticipated in it and that spared no effort to achieve the\r\nresults attained. In this connection, President Mubarak,\r\nhis Government and the people of the Arab Republic of\r\nEgypt, who did all in their power to make the Conference\r\na success, deserve our heartfelt thanks and gratitude. I\r\nwould also take this opportunity to pay a well-earned\r\ntribute to the United Nations Population Fund and its\r\nExecutive Director, Mrs. Nafis Sadik, not only for her\r\nwork on the Cairo Conference but also for her constant\r\nefforts to find solutions to demographic problems\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nEstablished by the United Nations in 1969, UNFPA\r\nwas given a mandate to make countries aware of\r\ndemographic problems and possible strategies for solving\r\nthem and to assist developing countries in their population\r\nprogrammes. Over the past 25 years, under the direction\r\nof the Economic and Social Council and its Executive\r\nBoard, the Fund has carried out its mandate with resolve,\r\nand the results achieved demonstrate the success of its\r\nwork. Indeed, in 1969, there was little awareness of\r\ndemographic questions and their impact on economic and\r\nsocial development and human welfare, and few\r\ndeveloping countries had a national programme dealing\r\nwith population questions.\r\nThus the role of the demographic factor in the\r\nevolution of economic and social development was\r\ngreatly underestimated. For the same reason it was\r\ncontroversial.\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nToday virtually all countries have begun to implement\r\npopulation programmes, which are backed up by very clear\r\nand functional strategies and plans of action. Furthermore,\r\na number of countries have established within their\r\nadministrations specialized units to ensure the integration of\r\ndemographic variables into economic and social\r\ndevelopment plans and programmes. The Cairo Conference\r\nhas just demonstrated that the demographic factor has\r\nbecome a key element in all debates, programmes and\r\naction in the field of development.\r\nToday we note the increased awareness of population\r\nproblems, and we can take some satisfaction in the progress\r\nthat has been achieved, since the creation of UNFPA,\r\ntowards stabilizing the growth in world population and\r\nimproving the health of mothers and children through the\r\nimplementation, in a large number of countries, of\r\nconcerted and coherent programmes of family planning.\r\nThe success of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development that was held recently in Cairo\r\nwill undoubtedly help to reinforce our efforts in the quest\r\nfor an integrated approach to development - an approach\r\nthat makes population programmes and policies a\r\nfundamental element in the population development\r\nequation.\r\nBut these results, encouraging as they are, should not\r\nmake us lose sight of the fact that the road we still have to\r\ntravel is long and full of ambushes. Although, in absolute\r\nterms, the birth rate has gone down, the annual increases in\r\nworld population are greater than anything seen in the past.\r\nThis obviously necessitates concerted global action. Such\r\naction is essential if we are to safeguard what has been\r\nachieved over the past 25 years.\r\nIn these circumstances, the Programme of Action that\r\nwas adopted in Cairo is a sound basis and a useful tool for\r\noptimizing the efforts of the international community. By\r\nadopting this Programme the international community, for\r\nthe first time, went beyond demographic targets and made\r\nthe individual and the family the very focus of development\r\nactivities and programmes. In so doing, it recognized that\r\ninvestment in the individual - in his health and education -\r\nis the key to sustainable economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment as a whole. This was the sense of my\r\nopening message at the International Conference on\r\nFamilies in October 1994.\r\nNone the less, I should like to remind people that if\r\nthe adoption of the Programme of Action itself was\r\nessential, its implementation is vital. Therefore, before\r\nconcluding, I should like to call upon Governments to do\r\neverything they can to translate into action the\r\nProgramme of Action that we adopted in Cairo. In this\r\nconnection, our support for the activities of UNFPA\r\nshould be further strengthened.\r\nAt a time when the international community has\r\nbeen fired by greater enthusiasm in its quest for\r\nsustainable development we should not lose sight of the\r\nfact that the question of population involves not only\r\nresources and the need to improve standards of living but\r\nalso our quest for peace and security on Earth.\r\nI now call on the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who wishes to\r\naddress the General Assembly at this time.\r\nThe Secretary-General: In 1969, Secretary-General\r\nU Thant called for a\r\n\"global partnership, to improve the human\r\nenvironment, to defuse the population explosion, and\r\nto supply the required momentum to development\r\nefforts.\"\r\nOut of U Thant’s concern, the United Nations Fund for\r\nPopulation Activities (UNFPA) was born.\r\nNow, 25 years later, it has operations in 140\r\ncountries; more than 100 countries make contributions to\r\nits work; it operates field offices in 58 countries; and it\r\nemploys a total of 837 staff members.\r\nThis milestone is a time to celebrate the remarkable\r\naccomplishments of the Fund. It is a time to recognize\r\nthe importance of the work of UNFPA. That work\r\ninvolves both formulating and implementing programmes\r\nfor population planning.\r\nThe Fund’s work is fundamental to the success of\r\nUnited Nations efforts for peace and development. It is\r\nalso challenging. It demands perseverance, patience and\r\ncommitment. UNFPA has shown all of those qualities.\r\nIt has earned the gratitude and the respect of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nI should like now to consider why the work of\r\nUNFPA is so crucial; to review some of its\r\naccomplishments; and to outline our hopes for the future,\r\nalong with the challenges we must face.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nThe United Nations is charged with the enormous task\r\nof promoting the welfare of all humanity. We work to\r\nmaintain and establish peace. And we promote\r\ndevelopment, to forestall problems. We have worked to\r\nprotect the environment and to foster healthy, democratic\r\nsocieties.\r\nBut we cannot attain our objective of a stable and\r\nprosperous world if the goalposts are moved down the field.\r\nThe infrastructure on which our solutions are based depends\r\non the size of our population. Our work towards such\r\nimportant aims as human rights, sustainable development,\r\ninternational trade and liveable cities cannot succeed if the\r\nincrease in the number of the world’s inhabitants becomes\r\nunbearable.\r\nToday, there is a real risk of such a tragedy. Global\r\npopulation has experienced runaway growth in recent years.\r\nFrom 1950 to 1990, it more than doubled in size.\r\nCurrently, the world’s population exceeds 5.5 billion,\r\nand almost 80 per cent live in the least-developed regions.\r\nOur projections show that the global population could more\r\nthan double again by the year 2050, with the biggest\r\nincreases in the developing countries.\r\nThe international community has long understood that\r\nthis trend presents a threat to stability. Thus, in 1947 - just\r\ntwo years after the United Nations came into being - the\r\nPopulation Commission was established. It was to track the\r\ngrowth of populations and provide other demographic\r\ninformation.\r\nThe UNFPA became operational in 1969 - three years\r\nafter the General Assembly authorized the United Nations\r\nto provide technical assistance relating to population.\r\nSupported through voluntary contributions, the Fund\r\nis now the largest internationally funded provider of\r\npopulation assistance to developing countries. Last year it\r\napproved 480 projects, for a total cost of $72 million.\r\nThe Fund’s purpose is to help set up population\r\nplanning programmes around the globe, and to provide\r\nfinancial assistance for their implementation. But it\r\nrecognizes the broad social implications of its work. The\r\nFund engages in other activities to further the\r\nimplementation of population policies. These include work\r\non census and civil registration; research in many fields;\r\nand information, communication and education.\r\nParticularly under the leadership of its current\r\nexecutive director, Mrs. Nafis Sadik, the UNFPA has\r\nfocused on the empowerment of women. In so doing,\r\nMrs. Sadik has made a major contribution to the cause of\r\nwomen’s rights.\r\nIn its work the Fund has been careful to respect the\r\nsovereign right of self-determination, for this is the\r\nreflection of the individual right of choice at an\r\ninternational level.\r\nOver the past 25 years, the Fund has benefited from\r\nexceptional leadership - first, by the late Mr. Rafael Salas,\r\nand, since 1987, by Mrs. Sadik. I wish to pay tribute to\r\nthem and to their staff. They have provided excellent\r\nservice to the United Nations.\r\nThe international community must continue to\r\nsupport the UNFPA. The Fund is uniquely situated to\r\npromote population policies. It brings to its work\r\nundoubted dedication, great moral weight, long practical\r\nand political experience, and presence in the field.\r\nThe UNFPA has also helped to organize a series of\r\nglobal population conferences. They have provided\r\nessential help to the United Nations in its efforts to\r\nencourage global policies on population. These meetings\r\nhave provided a forum for the world to take stock of\r\npotential problems and to map out solutions.\r\nAt the 1974 World Population Conference, held in\r\nBucharest, the international community adopted a World\r\nPlan of Action. It recognized the link between population\r\nand economic and social development. Ten years later\r\nthe United Nations convened the International Conference\r\non Population in Mexico City. The Declaration adopted\r\nthere addressed such issues as migration, urbanization and\r\nageing populations.\r\nMost recently the UNFPA played a major role in\r\norganizing the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, held this September in Cairo. Mrs. Sadik\r\nwas Secretary-General of the Conference. Almost 180\r\ncountries joined with non-governmental organizations at\r\nthe Conference to discuss how to balance population\r\ngrowth and sustainable development. And in six days the\r\nrepresentatives of many disparate cultures succeeded in\r\nadopting a Programme of Action, which maps out a\r\nstrategy for the next 20 years.\r\nAfterwards, Mrs. Sadik said that the Programme of\r\nAction adopted in Cairo \"starts from the reality of the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nworld we live in, and shows us the path to a better reality.\"\r\nThrough specific goals, spanning issues from education to\r\nreproductive health to family planning, the international\r\ncommunity charted a path that could lead the world away\r\nfrom environmental and social disasters.\r\nSuch conferences have promoted awareness. But it is\r\nimportant to remember that the international community\r\nmust follow through on the commitments it has made if it\r\nis to reap the benefits of its deliberations. Only political\r\nwill, backed by financial resources, can give life to them.\r\nOtherwise, plans of action soon become meaningless.\r\nThat is why the UNFPA’s role will continue to be\r\nimportant, and to be challenging. The Fund must continue\r\nto encourage societies to develop population policies. And\r\nit must continue to respect the traditions of many diverse\r\nsocieties for its work to touch on the most important\r\nquestions for humanity - relating to the relationships\r\nbetween men and women, the question of families, and\r\nposterity.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to serve as a forum\r\nwhere the world can debate its future. Fundamental\r\nquestions will be asked here. They may arouse concern.\r\nThe UNFPA must be prepared for controversy. But this is\r\na necessary part of its task, and indeed a testament to its\r\nimportance.\r\nIt is vital that in this enterprise we have the help of\r\nable and active programmes such as the UNFPA. I thank\r\nthe Fund for 25 years of support. I look forward to our\r\ncooperation over the next 25 years to come.\r\nThe President: (interpretation from French): At the\r\nrequest of the Executive Director of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund and following consultations with regional\r\ngroups, I would now authorize, as an exceptional measure,\r\nthe Chairman of the Group of 77 to speak on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (interpretation from French):\r\nI understand that the Chairman of the Group of 77 can\r\nspeak in that capacity only by way of an exception. It is\r\ntherefore an honour and a privilege for me to address the\r\nAssembly on behalf of the delegations that are members of\r\nthe Group of 77 and on behalf of the delegation of China,\r\nduring the commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\r\nThe sustained efforts the UNFPA has continued to\r\nmake to raise the consciousness of the world about the\r\nimportance of population questions and their strict\r\nrelationship with economic and social development, as\r\nwell as about the assistance the UNFPA provides to more\r\nthan 141 developing countries in this field, giving it pride\r\nof place today among the most visible institutions of the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nIt will be recalled that starting as part of a modest\r\ntrust fund which was placed under the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations in 1967 and then in 1969 was\r\nattached to the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) with a token seed capital of only $3 million,\r\nUNFPA today can derive legitimate pride from what has\r\nbeen achieved over the past 25 years, under the leadership\r\nof its first Executive Director, Mr. Rafael Salas, to whom\r\nhere we wish to pay a well-deserved posthumous tribute,\r\nand also thanks to the fresh life breathed into it by its\r\ncurrent Executive Director, Mrs. Nafis Sadik.\r\nThe mandate of the Fund as established by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in 1973 and reaffirmed by\r\nthat same body in 1986, has not lost any of its relevance\r\ntoday despite the amount of time that has passed. On the\r\ncontrary, the mandate has become more pertinent and\r\nrelevant than ever before. Thus as the years have passed\r\nthe evolution of population policies, particularly\r\ndemographic aspects and their impact on daily socio-\r\neconomic activities in every nation, has conferred on\r\nUNFPA an irreplaceable role.\r\nThe wealth of experience acquired by the Fund in\r\nthe fields of family planning and family services, and\r\nmother and child health, as well as its proven capacity to\r\nprovide and coordinate assistance and its flexibility to\r\nrespond to the needs of developing countries, bear witness\r\nto the maturity of UNFPA and consolidate its reputation\r\nwith the beneficiary countries, of which it has become a\r\nprivileged partner.\r\nAny anniversary is a propitious opportunity to take\r\nstock of what has been achieved so far and start to think\r\nabout what needs to be done to build for a sound future.\r\nIn this connection I wish to emphasize the very\r\nsignificant contribution made by the Fund to\r\nstrengthening the efforts of our countries by its presence\r\nat their side and helping with everything they have done\r\nto cope with population problems. The Group of 77 and\r\nChina welcome the efforts made by the Fund that have\r\ngreatly assisted in reducing infant and maternal mortality\r\nrates, particularly in the developing world, as well as its\r\nefforts towards promoting the almost universal use of\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nfamily planning programmes and improving life expectancy\r\nrates.\r\nThe success of the work of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development held in Cairo\r\nfrom 5 to 13 September this year, and the preparatory\r\nprocess relating to that Conference, is also a credit to\r\nUNFPA, the backbone of the organization of that world\r\nmeeting. That achievement alone would place this action\r\nof the Fund among the most signal efforts made by the\r\nUnited Nations to articulate international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFor the future, the ambitious Programme of Action\r\nadopted by the Cairo Conference, the qualitative and\r\nquantitative targets of which cover the next 20 years,\r\nshould be the new focus of interest of UNFPA. In view of\r\nthe immensity of the particular mission which has been\r\nallocated to it, it seems to us essential to consider the\r\norganizational and institutional arrangements that would be\r\nmost conducive to having this body properly perform its\r\ntask. The present session of the General Assembly\r\nprovides us with an excellent occasion to initiate this\r\nexercise.\r\nAmong the factors which have helped to strengthen\r\nthe credibility of the Fund and which at the same time have\r\ncontributed to improving its performance, we must refer to\r\nthe respect for certain key principles that have guided its\r\naction throughout its existence, particularly the following\r\ncardinal principles to which the developing countries are\r\nparticularly wedded: unconditional support for the\r\nbeneficiary countries; due respect for the specific situation\r\nprevailing in each country; respect for the sovereign right\r\nof States to draw up, formulate and implement population\r\npolicies and programmes in the light of their own needs;\r\nand, a flexible response to the specific needs of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nBeing mindful of these parameters is more than ever\r\nthe best possible guarantee for fruitful cooperation between\r\nthe Fund and all the beneficiary countries in the developing\r\nworld.\r\nIn conclusion, may I on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina take this opportunity to place on record our gratitude\r\nto Mrs. Nafis Sadik for her personal efforts and the talented\r\nway in which she has been directing this institution. Our\r\ncongratulations are extended equally to all the members of\r\nher dynamic team, who through their labours have been\r\nable to make sure that UNFPA is equal to the challenges of\r\nthe complex population problems. It will be understood\r\ntherefore that the delegations of the countries members of\r\nthe Group of 77, and of China, are particularly happy,\r\nthrough Algeria’s signature, to sponsor the draft\r\nresolution celebrating this important event.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of the Gambia, who will speak\r\non behalf of the Group of African States.\r\nMr. Jallow (Gambia): The Gambia as Chairman of\r\nthe African Group for this month is greatly honoured to\r\naddress this Assembly on behalf of the African Group on\r\nthe occasion of the commemoration of the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the operations of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA).\r\nSince this is the first time my delegation has\r\naddressed the Assembly in its capacity as Chairman of the\r\nAfrican Group - apart from our short intervention\r\nyesterday - it is quite fitting that I should convey to you,\r\nSir, the African Group’s deep gratification and sincere\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Since you\r\nare a distinguished son of Africa dedicated to the service\r\nof common humanity, we are convinced you will bring to\r\nyour high office the wealth of knowledge and rich\r\nexperience that has characterized your selfless service to\r\nyour country and Africa. Already, your laudable efforts\r\nto guide and enrich the proceedings of the forty-ninth\r\nsession are beginning to be felt in all aspects of our work.\r\nIndeed, it is a clear indication of the immense success\r\nthat will eventually crown the work of this session. On\r\nbehalf of the African Group, I wish to assure you, Sir, of\r\nour fullest support and readiness to work with you\r\nthroughout to achieve a successful session.\r\nThe commemoration of 25 years of UNFPA’s\r\nactivities, exemplified throughout by dedicated and\r\nmeritorious service to our communities, deserves our\r\ncommendation and international recognition. It therefore\r\nbehooves us on this happy occasion to extend our\r\ncongratulations and best wishes to UNFPA, its\r\nindefatigable Executive Director and efficient staff, and\r\nits dedicated partners. The African Group feels it is\r\nappropriate to support fully the congratulatory draft\r\nresolution before the General Assembly and hopes that it\r\nwill be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe celebration of this silver anniversary is taking\r\nplace at a historic period in the annals of world\r\npopulation activities, particularly the just-concluded\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nheld in Cairo. The Conference not only generated wide\r\ninternational interest but also drew into sharp focus\r\npopulation issues and their impact on development. The\r\nProgramme of Action adopted by the Conference will serve\r\nas a guidepost for bringing together the interrelated issues\r\nof population, sustained economic growth and development,\r\nand the environment, all of which are of great concern to\r\nthe international community.\r\nGlobally, UNFPA has, true to its mandate, developed\r\nthe international community’s capacity to respond to\r\npopulation issues; raised awareness of the social, economic\r\nand environmental implications of national and international\r\nproblems associated with population growth; and provided\r\nassistance and coordination in population planning,\r\nprogramming and implementation.\r\nIn this context, Africa, like other regions, has been a\r\ndirect and important beneficiary of UNFPA’s population\r\nprogrammes relating to the efforts to moderate rapid\r\npopulation growth, uneven population distribution, and high\r\nmaternal and infant mortality, and to improve the\r\nreproductive health and behaviour of the relevant sectors of\r\nthe population.\r\nIt is worthy of note that Africa’s economic\r\ndevelopment has, in general, not kept pace with its\r\npopulation growth rate. The effects of this imbalance are\r\nfelt in the areas of health care, housing, schooling,\r\nemployment, and food security, among other pressing\r\nneeds. Thus, the crucial role of UNFPA in helping to\r\nalleviate the inadequacies created by rapid population\r\ngrowth in Africa has continued to grow in scope and\r\nimportance.\r\nWe in Africa are mindful of the fact that efforts to\r\nenhance economic performance, provide social services and\r\nmaintain social order and political stability continue to be\r\neroded, with painful consequences in some cases, by\r\npopulation pressures. It is for this reason that our concerns\r\nfor population issues have been reflected in many regional\r\ndeclarations, international instruments, documents and\r\naction programmes, including, to list just a few, the Treaty\r\nestablishing the African Economic Community; the\r\nDakar-Ngor Declaration on Population, Family and\r\nSustainable Development; and the Tunis Declaration and\r\nResolution on Population and Development by the General\r\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government. In fact, the\r\npurpose of the African Population Commission, established\r\nin 1993, is to bring maximum political attention to and\r\naction on population on the part of the States members of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity. At Cairo, Africa joined\r\nthe other regions of the world in focusing on the\r\nproblems of population and development and arriving at\r\na consensus for international action. Indeed, the world\r\nsaw the willingness and the commitment of Governments\r\nand grass-roots organizations to come together to play a\r\ncrucial and catalytic role in moving the cause of social\r\ndevelopment forward into the next century.\r\nAfrica is a priority region for population assistance,\r\nas is attested to by the depth and breadth of population\r\nprogrammes being assisted by UNFPA. Such assistance\r\nat the country level should continue, and should be further\r\nintensified in the aftermath of the 1994 International\r\nConference on Population and Development. The\r\nrelationship between population and social and economic\r\ndevelopment and the need to formulate and implement a\r\nnational population policy to address the issues involved\r\nare being given more urgency and importance.\r\nTogether with UNFPA, and in light of the\r\nProgramme of Action of the Cairo Conference, African\r\nGovernments are looking forward to international\r\ncollaboration to develop and implement that Programme\r\nof Action. In doing so, we must concentrate on the\r\nfollowing strategic goals: intensification of information\r\non population, education and communication programmes\r\nin both the formal and the non-formal sectors in order to\r\nencourage attitudinal change, especially among rural and\r\nurban adolescents; integration of population factors into\r\ndevelopment plans and activities; and increased support to\r\nreproductive health and family planning in order to cater\r\nto the health and social needs of the most vulnerable\r\ngroups - that is, mothers and children. We should also\r\nprovide support to help improve the social, economic,\r\nhealth and political status of women.\r\nIn recognition of the challenges ahead, UNFPA has\r\nbeen forging partnerships with African regional\r\norganizations such as the Organization of African Unity\r\nfor increased political support and the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa and the African Development\r\nBank for an increased resource base for population\r\nactivities. UNFPA has also actively sought to identify\r\nviable non-governmental organizations that can participate\r\nin population and development activities at the country\r\nlevel. In order to bring technical assistance nearer and\r\nfaster to African countries, UNFPA has also set up three\r\ncountry support teams in sub-Saharan Africa, located in\r\nDakar, Addis Ababa and Harare, respectively. More\r\nresources would be required to meet the challenge of the\r\n1994 International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment. I therefore call on all African\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nGovernments to continue their support for the population\r\ncause and to UNFPA.\r\nIn concluding, I should like once more to express the\r\nAfrican Group’s congratulations to UNFPA on its\r\nachievements during the past 25 years and to express our\r\nsupport for its programmes in the years ahead. We take\r\ncognizance of the conviction and the resourcefulness of\r\nUNFPA’s leadership, as personified by its able Executive\r\nDirector, Mrs. Nafis Sadik, who worked tirelessly and\r\ncourageously, together with a highly qualified and\r\nmotivated staff, to make the Cairo Conference a reality and\r\na success. This commemoration of UNFPA’s 25 years of\r\noperations and notable achievements is indeed timely and\r\nmemorable.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Samoa, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the Asian States.\r\nMr. Slade (Samoa): I have the honour to speak in my\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Asian Group to express on\r\nbehalf of the Group our warmest congratulations and\r\nappreciation to the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA) and its staff on this memorable occasion, the\r\ncommemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of its\r\noperations. The Asian Group fully supports the\r\ncongratulatory draft resolution before the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Asia Pacific region contains six of the 10 most\r\npopulous countries in the world. Stretching over nine time\r\nzones from Azerbaijan in the west to my own country,\r\nSamoa, in the east, this region can be proud of many\r\nachievements, from the green revolution to industrial\r\ndevelopment. Its current population of over 3 billion is\r\nboth a triumph and a challenge. Better medical techniques\r\nand improved health and nutrition have led to dramatic\r\nreductions in infant mortality rates and to longer life\r\nexpectancy.\r\nSince becoming fully operational in 1969, the UNFPA\r\nhas accumulated a quarter century of experience in\r\nformulating and implementing population policies and\r\nprogrammes. As the world’s largest multilateral population\r\nagency, the Fund is in a unique position to assess\r\nopportunities and identify solutions for the smooth and\r\neffective functioning of population programmes.\r\nOver the years, in collaboration with and at the request\r\nof Governments in developing countries, including many in\r\nthe Asian region, UNFPA-funded programmes have made\r\nadvances in increasing awareness of and appreciation for\r\npopulation dynamics and their global implications.\r\nUNFPA has always recognized that population activities\r\nare multisectoral, with core activities such as family\r\nplanning and data collection and analysis, as well as the\r\nformation of population policy, educational programmes,\r\nthe provision of vital information and communication.\r\nThe improvement of women’s health and education, and\r\nconcern for the environment are also key core activities.\r\nRegional assistance has been provided in cooperation and\r\ncollaboration with the relevant subregional organizations:\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations, the South\r\nPacific Commission, the South Pacific Forum, the South\r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization.\r\nThe overall assistance provided by UNFPA to the\r\nAsia region since 1969 amounts to some $869 million.\r\nIn my own country, I am pleased to note that the\r\ncooperation between UNFPA and Samoa started in 1971\r\nwith the assistance to the family welfare programme in\r\nstrengthening service delivery; the provision of\r\ninformation, education and communication; the\r\nintroduction of population education into the school\r\nsystem; a contribution to the successful completion of the\r\n1991 census and in the population and environment\r\nproject which is now being implemented by the South\r\nPacific Regional Environment Programme.\r\nThe determination of the international community to\r\nresolve population issues has reached new heights. Since\r\nthe 1974 World Population Conference, the International\r\nConference on Population in 1984, the International\r\nForum on Population in the Twenty-First Century in 1989\r\nand this year’s International Conference on Population\r\nand Development in Cairo, a quantum leap has truly been\r\nachieved. There has been a shift from the previous\r\nemphasis on demography and population control to\r\npopulation and sustainable development. There is also a\r\nrecognition now of the need for comprehensive\r\nreproductive health care and reproductive rights; growing\r\nco l labora t ion be tween governmenta l and\r\nnon-governmental agencies; renewed emphasis on\r\npeople’s participation at the community level; improving\r\nthe status of women in every aspect of development; a\r\nrecognition of the needs of adolescents; and, perhaps\r\nabove all, stronger political commitment.\r\nRapid population growth and unbalanced distribution\r\npose serious challenges to sustainable development and\r\nprosperity in the coming decades. At the national level,\r\ndeveloping countries struggle to keep pace with the needs\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nof their people. Governments face critical pressures in\r\ntrying to feed, house and educate their population while at\r\nthe same trying to provide adequate services to rural and\r\ngrowing urban areas. At the individual level, reproductive\r\nhealth and family planning are essential needs. The\r\nregion’s challenges include achieving a better balance\r\nbetween population growth and its resource base; providing\r\njobs in growing urban areas; increasing awareness of and\r\novercoming obstacles in environmental protection; and\r\nimproving the status of women.\r\nBut greater challenges lie ahead, and we in the Asian\r\nGroup are confident that UNFPA, with the assistance of the\r\ninternational community, will continue to provide dynamic\r\nleadership as it has done in the past to implement the\r\nProgramme of Action adopted recently at the Cairo\r\nConference. The successful outcome of the Cairo\r\nConference on Population and Development surely attests\r\nto the skilful manner and active role played by UNFPA and\r\nthe Conference secretariat in guiding and promoting the\r\nnew global population agenda in the context of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The objective now for the Fund and indeed\r\nfor the international community is fully to implement the\r\nProgramme of Action agreed to in Cairo.\r\nLet me conclude by offering our congratulations on\r\nbehalf of the Asian Group to the Executive Director,\r\nMrs. Nafis Sadik, for her devoted and outstanding\r\nleadership, for her vision in steering the Organization in the\r\nright direction to where it is today, and indeed for the\r\nexample she and her predecessor in office have set for the\r\nentire United Nations system. We wish Mrs. Sadik and\r\nUNFPA well in their efforts for the tasks ahead.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call on\r\nthe representative of the Czech Republic, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the Group of Eastern European States.\r\nMr. Kovanda (Czech Republic): It is an honour and\r\nprivilege for me, as Chairman of the Eastern European\r\nGroup of States this month, sincerely to congratulate the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on its twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary and to express our sincere appreciation for\r\nall the achievements it has attained in defining and\r\nresolving problems related to population and development\r\nissues and to the improvement of quality of life.\r\nIt turns out that, at this moment, not very many of\r\nUNFPA’s programmes are operating in countries of the\r\nregion I am representing here today, and one might well\r\nask whether this indicates that the region is not facing any\r\nproblems. The answer is, obviously, that this is hardly the\r\ncase. More likely, one could argue that previous regimes\r\nof the region of Eastern Europe had little interest in\r\noutsiders examining terribly closely their population\r\npolicies and practices - policies and practices that were\r\noften very damaging to the well-being of women, the\r\nwelfare of children and the health of the family.\r\nI should just like to mention a couple of extreme\r\nexamples that come to mind. On the one hand, in several\r\nparts of the Eastern European region, abortion has been\r\nused in essence as a form of contraception, on demand\r\nand with hardly any limitations. On the other hand, there\r\nwere other parts of the Eastern European region in which\r\npopulation growth was promoted at any cost, whatever the\r\neffect on the resulting thousands of unwanted babies.\r\nConsequently, as I said, hardly can it be said that the\r\nregion has been spared any problems.\r\nFor the Eastern European region, the important\r\nperspective is not only the linkage between population\r\npolicies and economic development, but also - and\r\nperhaps even more so - the linkage between population\r\npolicies and the devastated ecology of many areas in our\r\nregion. On this occasion, therefore, we look forward to\r\nan even closer cooperation of our countries with the\r\nUNFPA so that we can garner the full benefits of the\r\nexperience UNFPA has accumulated over the past quarter\r\ncentury.\r\nMeanwhile, however, we find it absolutely proper\r\nand correct that the UNFPA should be focusing in\r\nparticular on the most vulnerable and most disadvantaged\r\nparts of the world. This is indeed as it should be.\r\nUNFPA’s most recent achievement, of course, was the\r\nCairo Conference. In our opinion, the controversies that\r\nwere part and parcel of that Conference are a healthy sign\r\nthat the Conference was grappling with live issues that\r\nconcern every country - indeed, every family. In our\r\nview, the Plan of Action adopted in Cairo should be\r\nconsidered as a minimum programme to be implemented,\r\nespecially as it concerns the advancement of women, the\r\nquality and extent of health care and family care of\r\nchildren, and the quality of education.\r\nMy delegation and the countries of the region I am\r\nrepresenting here today appreciate tremendously the work\r\nof UNFPA’s Executive Director, Mrs. Sadik. Let me\r\nmention that we find it not terribly common for women\r\nto be heading important international institutions, even\r\nwithin the United Nations family, and we certainly hope\r\nthat she will not be for very long one of the very few\r\nwomen in high positions. Her leadership no doubt\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\ncontributes to the effectiveness of the UNFPA, and, on\r\nbehalf of my regional group, I should like to extend my\r\ncongratulations to her and to all her colleagues - and happy\r\nbirthday, UNFPA.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call on\r\nthe representative of Paraguay, who will speak on behalf of\r\nthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States.\r\nMr. Fernandez Estigarribia (Paraguay)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): This month Paraguay has the\r\ngreat honour of presiding over the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, and, in that capacity, I\r\nshould like to convey our congratulations and our\r\nappreciation to the United Nations Population Fund on the\r\noccasion of the commemoration of its 25 years of\r\noperation. The Group of Latin American and Caribbean\r\nStates considers appropriate and supports the\r\ncommemorative draft resolution introduced before the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nEver since its inception, the Population Fund has\r\nprovided, at the request of their Governments, assistance to\r\nthe countries of our region in a broad range of priority\r\nprogrammes and in strengthening their national capacity in\r\npopulation matters. Areas that received support from\r\nprogrammes at both the State and regional levels include:\r\ndata collection and analysis, including census operations;\r\nsurveys on fertility, mortality and migration; the extension\r\nof health services to mothers and children, including family\r\nplanning; education on population issues; and research and\r\ntraining in population matters and development.\r\nAlmost $380 million of its regular funds have been\r\nmade available to the region through the Fund ever since\r\nthe start-up of its operations, and around $23 million in\r\nadditional funds has been mobilized, on a multilateral and\r\nbilateral basis, over the same period.\r\nThe Fund has always recognized the multisectoral\r\nnature of population assistance, and thus it has been able to\r\nmeet the needs of the countries of our region despite their\r\nvery different population situations and problems.\r\nThis policy must be pursued and expanded. That kind\r\nof support - attuned to the diversity in cultures and\r\ndiffering perceptions as well as to the role of moral and\r\nreligious values - must be at the heart of all the Fund does.\r\nWe consider important the establishment of the new\r\nsystem of technical assistance to countries, which is based\r\nin Santiago de Chile and involves a support team that\r\nincludes 12 advisers. That system has made it possible to\r\nincrease the capacity of the Fund and the speed with\r\nwhich it will be able to respond to and meet the technical\r\nassistance needs of the countries of our region. The\r\nsystem also makes it a priority to identify and make use\r\nof the technical resources available at the national level.\r\nOver the 25 years of its existence the Fund has been\r\nable to build up vast experience in the formulation and\r\nexecution of programmes and projects. These\r\nprogrammes have contributed to advancing knowledge of\r\nthe workings of demographics, its determining factors and\r\nits implications.\r\nOn this occasion we must also refer to the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nwhich took place in Cairo last month. The Programme of\r\nAction it adopted represents a milestone in furthering the\r\nunderstanding of population matters, as it emphasizes\r\nindividual rights and decisions and, in particular, the\r\nimperative need to give special priority to supporting the\r\nintegral development of women and to their full\r\nparticipation in the benefits of development.\r\nThe last few decades have, in Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean, seen a marked drop in the rates of fertility,\r\ndemographic growth and mortality, particularly in infant\r\nmortality. These strides notwithstanding, serious\r\nproblems remain in the region that affect in particular the\r\npoorest segments of the population: the fertility rate of\r\nadolescents has not shown the same degree of change as\r\nthat of other age groups, and maternal mortality continues\r\nat unacceptably high levels.\r\nAccess on the part of the poor to information and\r\nquality services in terms of reproductive health and family\r\nplanning is limited, and a great deal remains to be learned\r\nabout interrelationships between population, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the environment so that appropriate\r\nprogrammes and policies can be designed. Policies aimed\r\nat decentralizing public spending and social services\r\nrequire an increased capacity for analysis and greater\r\noperational capability at the local and municipal levels.\r\nThe region identified many of the critical problems\r\nbesetting its countries during the preparation process for\r\nthe Cairo Conference, and in May 1993 it adopted the\r\nLatin American and Caribbean Consensus on Population\r\nand Development as the outcome of the Regional Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, held in Mexico City. The preparation of\r\nnational reports on population led to a careful analysis of\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\neach national situation and in most of the countries grew\r\nout of a broad nationwide consultation process that included\r\nGovernments, non-governmental organizations and various\r\nother groups of civil society. By the same token, this spirit\r\nof participation and inclusion was manifest in the make-up\r\nof the national delegations to the Cairo Conference.\r\nAs our region hails the Population Fund on its twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary, it expresses the hope that the Fund will\r\ngo on supporting the rewarding process of gaining insight,\r\nthrough the broadest possible national participation, into\r\nways of solving the population problems of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, I should like to convey our\r\ncongratulations to Mrs. Nafis Sadik, Executive Director of\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund, on her vision in the\r\npopulation arena, which has made it possible to place\r\nwomen and their needs in the forefront of population-\r\nrelated activities.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nnext on the representative of Canada, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the Group of Western European and Other States.\r\nMrs. Fréchette (Canada): On behalf of the Group of\r\nWestern European and Other States, I am happy to join\r\nprevious speakers in congratulating the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) on the occasion of its twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary.\r\nOver the last 25 years we have all come to know\r\nmuch more about the dynamics of population and its\r\nimportance to development. Much of what we have learned\r\nis thanks to the efforts of UNFPA. The recently concluded\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nbuilt on UNFPA’s experiences, its country programmes and\r\nits knowledge of what actually works at the grass-roots\r\nlevel in adopting a Programme of Action that reflects the\r\ninterrelationships between population and many\r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nThe mandate of UNFPA, as originally defined and\r\nlater reaffirmed in 1986, calls on the Fund to assume a\r\nleading role in promoting population programmes, building\r\nawareness of population issues and developing the capacity\r\nof countries to respond to their particular needs in\r\npopulation and family planning. We applaud the\r\nconsiderable success that UNFPA has enjoyed during its\r\n25-year operation in pursuing these objectives. It has been\r\nparticularly effective in establishing the population field as\r\na critical development issue. This has been clearly\r\ndemonstrated by the extremely rapid growth of global\r\ninterest in and demand for population programmes.\r\nUNFPA programmes encourage activities aimed at\r\nimproving the quality of family planning services and\r\nenhancing their social acceptability and effectiveness.\r\nUsing such methods as country support teams, the Fund\r\nformulates population education activities and helps\r\ndesign projects for the special needs of women,\r\nadolescents and indigenous communities. By helping to\r\nimprove women’s health, education and economic\r\nopportunities, the Fund has contributed to important\r\ndevelopment goals, as well as having had an effect on\r\npopulation growth.\r\nBefore closing, I would like to acknowledge with\r\nappreciation the dedication of the UNFPA staff and their\r\nmost valuable contribution to the work and success of the\r\nFund. I would also like to pay a special tribute to\r\nMrs. Nafis Sadik, who has provided and continues to\r\nprovide such dynamic and effective direction to UNFPA.\r\nWe are particularly pleased to note that under her\r\nleadership UNFPA’s focus on women has extended to her\r\nown staff, where 44 per cent of professional positions are\r\nheld by women. This is one of the highest percentages\r\namong United Nations agencies and organizations, and\r\nspeaks well of UNFPA’s capacity to practise what it\r\npreaches.\r\nOn behalf of the Group of Western European and\r\nOther States, I again congratulate UNFPA on its\r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary, and express our deepest gratitude\r\nto its dedicated staff and volunteers.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\nnext on the representative of the United States, the host\r\ncountry.\r\nMs. Oakley (United States of America): My\r\ndelegation, as the delegation of the host country, is\r\npleased to be here today on the occasion of the twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary of the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA). Since its creation UNFPA has been the\r\nworld’s leading multilateral force in the family planning\r\nand reproductive health field. It has exercised this\r\nleadership role with great skill and significant success.\r\nMost important to UNFPA’s success over the last 25\r\nyears has been its strong and dynamic management.\r\nFrom the early years, under the leadership of Rafael\r\nSalas, to the present, under the courageous and sure hand\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nof Mrs. Nafis Sadik, UNFPA has grown stronger, more\r\ncapable and increasingly effective.\r\nOver these 25 years tremendous changes have\r\noccurred in both the scope and the prevalence of national\r\nand international policies dealing with population and\r\nreproductive health. A quarter of a century ago few\r\ncountries even recognized the importance of population\r\nissues within the development process. Today few\r\ncountries question the critical relationship between\r\npopulation and sustainable development.\r\nIn addition to this dramatic change in prevalence, we\r\nall recognize the significant change in scope these policies\r\nhave undergone. Nowhere was this change more evident\r\nthan during preparations for the very successful\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development.\r\nPopulation issues are now recognized as having a much\r\nbroader influence on development overall and as being\r\nmuch more broadly influenced by other societal factors.\r\nA significant achievement of UNFPA has been its role\r\nin establishing national population coordination units.\r\nThese units have increased both the visibility of population\r\nissues and the implementation of national programmes to\r\naddress them. UNFPA has also been key to the inclusion\r\nof population issues within many nations’ development\r\nplanning processes. Incorporation of population as a key\r\nvariable within the complex development equation is critical\r\nto efforts to maintain the attention of policy makers.\r\nWe also recognize and applaud the impact UNFPA has\r\nhad over the last 25 years in the world-wide expansion of\r\nservices and information. UNFPA has contributed greatly\r\nto the significant expansion in world-wide access to\r\nmaternal and child health and family planning services, as\r\nwell as the vast increases in information, education and\r\ncommunication. More recently UNFPA has promoted an\r\nincreased understanding of the critical role women play in\r\nadvancing and addressing population issues as well as their\r\nkey role in national development.\r\nThe culmination of many of these activities was, of\r\ncourse, the recent International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, held in Cairo. The tremendous success\r\nof this historic conference is testimony to the years of\r\npreparation and hard work that went into this undertaking.\r\nAt the Conference an unprecedented number of nations\r\nreached consensus on a visionary Programme of Action to\r\naddress the issues associated with rapid population growth,\r\nquality of life and sustainable development. The\r\nProgramme of Action recognizes the interrelationships\r\nbetween population and development and calls for a new\r\ncomprehensive approach to address population and related\r\ndevelopment issues. It acknowledges that both rapid\r\npopulation growth and wasteful consumption patterns play\r\nmajor roles in environmental degradation.\r\nThe Programme of Action provides concrete\r\nestimates of financial resource requirements for\r\nimplementing the new comprehensive approach.\r\nAlthough these resource requirements are substantial, they\r\nare both attainable and worthy of our support. The return\r\non the world’s investment in these programmes will be a\r\nbetter life for all its people.\r\nOne of the most important outcomes of the\r\nConference is that it has focused the world’s attention on\r\nthe urgency of addressing population issues. We have the\r\nknowledge, skill and technology needed to address these\r\nissues. The Cairo Conference demonstrated that we also\r\nhave the political will. Success is within our grasp. Now\r\nis the time to act.\r\nYet, while the Cairo Programme of Action reflects\r\nconsensus among nations and will be implemented\r\naccording to nations’ own laws and traditions, the\r\ndocument also acknowledges the deeply personal nature\r\nof reproductive decisions. These decisions profoundly\r\naffect the lives of individual people, particularly women.\r\nA central theme of the new comprehensive approach is\r\nthe critical role that women must play in reproductive\r\ndecision-making and the development of nations. The\r\neducation, empowerment and equality of women are key\r\ncomponents of improving the lives of people in all\r\nnations.\r\nThe right to choose the number and spacing of one’s\r\nchildren freely and responsibly has been recognized\r\ninternationally for more than 20 years and was reaffirmed\r\nat Cairo. The Programme of Action emphasizes the\r\nimportance of ensuring that quality, voluntary family\r\nplanning and reproductive health information and services\r\nare universally available so that all the world’s people can\r\nexercise this right.\r\nThe accomplishments of these years have been\r\nremarkable, but we must focus our sights on the\r\nchallenges for the future. Here again, we are looking to\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for\r\nleadership.\r\nImplementation of the comprehensive approach will\r\nrequire better coordination among United Nations\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nagencies. UNFPA will lead in the effort to develop a\r\ncoordinated action plan for follow-up clearly outlining each\r\nagency’s role and avoiding unnecessary duplication.\r\nWe also wish to underscore the importance of an\r\nassessment by UNFPA and all donors as to how approaches\r\nto population assistance should be modified to take into\r\naccount the comprehensive plan. We have been pleased to\r\nlearn that this review is already under way at UNFPA.\r\nA critical new area that I believe UNFPA must\r\naddress is the reproductive health needs of refugee women.\r\nDeveloping new partnerships with old friends - like the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) - to integrate reproductive health\r\nservices into emergency health care is imperative and\r\nUNFPA’s leadership in this will be essential.\r\nOf course, successful action in this regard and on the\r\nCairo recommendations as a whole will be possible only if\r\nthere is a substantial increase in available funding from all\r\nsources, including multilateral and bilateral donors, recipient\r\ncountries and the private sector. UNFPA must lead an\r\ninternational effort to translate political consensus into the\r\nresources needed to move forward with the implementation\r\nof the Programme of Action of the International Conference\r\non Population and Development.\r\nMy delegation wholeheartedly supports efforts to\r\nimplement the recommendations of the Programme of\r\nAction. We are examining population issues within the\r\nUnited States to ensure that our own programmes are\r\nconsistent with the international consensus. Perhaps more\r\nimportant, as a world leader in funding for population and\r\nreproductive health programmes, we are working hard to\r\nincrease our own financial commitments in this area. We\r\nhope other nations will join us in providing the necessary\r\nresources to implement this challenging agenda. We also\r\nlook forward to working in partnership with other nations\r\nand multilateral organizations in undertaking these critical\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that the United States is\r\ndelighted to be back among the nations that can be counted\r\non as strong supporters of UNFPA. Our commitment\r\nreflects both the importance of its work and the high\r\nesteem in which we hold the Organization. We hope to be\r\nable to continue to increase our financial support in the\r\nfuture as we have in recent years. The past 25 years of\r\nhave been a wonderful beginning. We look forward to the\r\nnext 25 years of continuing to build on this strong\r\nfoundation.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Germany, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union.\r\nMr. Graf zu Rantzau (Germany): It is an honour\r\nfor me to address the Assembly today on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union and Austria on the very special occasion\r\nof the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA).\r\nAn institution which started its operations a quarter\r\nof a century ago has matured. It began with a simple\r\ntrust fund. In 1972 the General Assembly changed the\r\ncharacter of UNFPA into a fund established under the\r\nauthority of the General Assembly and placed it under the\r\ngoverning body of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), by duly taking into account the\r\nseparate identity of UNFPA. Subsequently, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council played a major role in\r\ndefining the aims and the purposes of the Fund, including\r\nthe establishment of general principles to be applied for\r\nthe allocation of resources. In 1987 the name was\r\nchanged to United Nations Population Fund. This all has\r\nproved to be a very solid basis. UNFPA has developed\r\nover the time into one of the most important players in\r\nthe field of multilateral population and development\r\nassistance. Its neutrality and responsiveness to the\r\nspecific needs of individual developing countries\r\nrepresents a unique comparative advantage.\r\nThe Fund’s first Executive Director, Rafael Salas,\r\nlaid the basis for UNFPA and influenced to a very high\r\ndegree its the scope and development for 18 years, until\r\nhis death in 1987. He is to be praised and remembered\r\nas the spiritual founding father. The fact that this Fund\r\nhas for many years now been the fastest growing\r\ninstitution in the United Nations system is eloquent\r\ntestimony to his important contribution.\r\nAn institution depends on motivated and committed\r\nstaff at all levels. The staff of UNFPA have consistently\r\nperformed exceptionally over the last 25 years, often in\r\ndifficult circumstances. We would like to congratulate all\r\nof them today and to wish them well in their future work.\r\nAn institution depends on outstanding leadership. Since\r\nMrs. Sadik became Executive Director of UNFPA in\r\n1987, she has provided inspiration not only for the Fund\r\nbut also for the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. I trust that today is a happy day\r\nfor Mrs. Sadik. She is the first woman in the United\r\nNations system to head a major fund or programme. She\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nand UNFPA have broken the ground. Today, four United\r\nNations organizations are headed by professional women.\r\nSince 1969 UNFPA has provided close to $3 billion\r\nin population assistance to virtually every developing\r\ncountry. As the Assembly knows, the States members of\r\nthe European Union together with other European countries\r\nprovided two-thirds of the voluntary contributions in 1993.\r\nWe will continue to provide strong support to UNFPA and\r\nits activities in the future.\r\nUNFPA played a significant role in ensuring the\r\nsuccess of the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment. The Conference resulted in a Programme of\r\nAction which contains a global approach to population and\r\ndevelopment. Many of the ideas contained in this\r\ndocument have already been put into practice in the field by\r\nUNFPA. Through its advocacy role UNFPA has done a\r\ngreat job worldwide by focusing the population debate on\r\ngirls and their education, on gender equity by empowering\r\nwomen in development, on broadening individual choice\r\nthrough the use of family planning. Let me assure the\r\nAssembly that the European Union will do all it can to\r\nfulfil the commitments made in Cairo.\r\nIn conclusion, it has always been a privilege and a\r\npleasure to work closely with our friends and colleagues in\r\nUNFPA. We wish them well on this special day and look\r\nforward to continuing close cooperation with them in the\r\nfuture. We trust that the draft resolution commemorating\r\nthis anniversary will be adopted by acclamation.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of India, President of the\r\nExecutive Board of UNFPA.\r\nMr. Ansari (India): It is a pleasure and an honour for\r\nmy country to participate in today’s commemoration of the\r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the operations of the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA). As President of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\r\nUNFPA Executive Board for the year 1994, I have had the\r\nadvantage of observing at first hand the dedicated work of\r\nthe UNFPA under its Executive Director, Mrs. Nafis Sadik.\r\nAs the dynamic and committed leader of a highly efficient\r\norganization, she has made the Fund an effective and\r\ntrusted development partner.\r\nIt will be recalled that in 1973 the Economic and\r\nSocial Council proclaimed the UNFPA’s aims and\r\npurposes, and they remain valid today: to build up\r\nknowledge and capacity, to promote awareness, to extend\r\nsystematic and sustained economic assistance, and to play\r\na leading role in the United Nations in promoting\r\npopulation programmes. The success of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo last\r\nmonth is proof of the competence with which the UNFPA\r\nhas fulfilled this mandate.\r\nWhile most of the credit for this goes to the\r\ncountries themselves, the UNFPA has certainly been an\r\nimportant catalyst in this process, especially in the areas\r\nof creation of awareness, policy and programme\r\nformulation, data collection and analysis, and capacity-\r\nbuilding. The UNFPA is the largest internationally\r\nfunded source of population assistance. By mid-1994 it\r\nhad provided a total of nearly $3 billion to more than 141\r\ncountries globally.\r\nThe role of the UNFPA has, for me, an\r\nunderstandably special significance, as its long-standing\r\ncooperation with my own country, India, in the area of\r\nfamily planning and training of staff, dates back to 1974.\r\nThe current UNFPA programme is the fourth in my\r\ncountry and the Fund’s largest. It gives me particular\r\npleasure, therefore, to join this commemorative process\r\ntoday.\r\nThe Cairo Programme of Action of September 1994\r\ncrystallizes several decades of national and international\r\nexperience in the field of population and development. In\r\nthe words of Mrs. Sadik, the Programme of Action,\r\n\"shows us the path to a better reality.\" That path, clearly,\r\nmust pass through the United Nations. It must build upon\r\nthe blueprints of action crafted by the world’s community\r\nof nations at the Earth Summit in Rio and the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nin Cairo. It must be refined and elaborated at the social\r\nSummit in Copenhagen, the women’s Conference in\r\nBeijing and Habitat II in Istanbul, and it must be further\r\nstrengthened and focused through the United Nations\r\nAgenda for Development. UNFPA has a major role to\r\nplay in that process, in close collaboration with its\r\ndevelopment partners within the United Nations\r\ndevelopment system and in keeping with the principles of\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nThe past two years have witnessed remarkable\r\nchanges in the United Nations. We have adopted\r\nresolutions to greatly strengthen the operational activities\r\nof the United Nations development system and to\r\nrevitalize and restructure the United Nations in economic,\r\nsocial and related fields. In doing so we have sought to\r\ngive greater coherence to the international development\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nsystem and to improve the quality and impact of the\r\ndevelopment activities of the United Nations. A notable\r\nresult of that revitalization and restructuring has been the\r\nestablishment of the new Executive Board of the United\r\nNations funds and programmes, including the UNDP and\r\nthe UNFPA, of which I have had the honour of serving as\r\nPresident this year. That, and other experience, has\r\nconvinced me that the United Nations system can and must\r\nplay a lead role in helping build that path to a better reality.\r\nTwenty-five years of competent functioning by the United\r\nNations Population Fund clearly emphasizes the need for\r\nthe Fund to play an integral role in this cooperative process.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Norway, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the Nordic countries.\r\nMr. Birn Lian (Norway): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the Nordic countries - Denmark, Finland,\r\nSweden and Norway.\r\nI would like to express our pleasure at taking part in\r\nthe celebration today of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Our warm\r\ncongratulations go to the dedicated and able staff that\r\nmakes UNFPA what it is today, both at the country level\r\nand here in New York. We especially want to pay tribute\r\nto Mrs. Nafis Sadik, from whose leadership the Fund has\r\nso greatly benefited. I should add that we are particularly\r\nsatisfied at the way in which the International Conference\r\non Population and Development was prepared and\r\nconducted, at the efforts of that Conference’s secretariat,\r\nand at the contributions of the dynamic Secretary-General\r\nof the Conference, Mrs. Nafis Sadik.\r\nThe UNFPA has made major contributions in building\r\nawareness, supporting Governments in the adoption of\r\nforward-looking policies and programmes, funding\r\nworthwhile research and operations efforts and coordinating\r\ncountry-level efforts among donors, recipients, and\r\nexecuting agencies. One very clear indication of the\r\nrespect the Fund commands is the increase in voluntary\r\ncontributions over the years.\r\nSince 1968 the increasing diversity of country needs\r\nhas put growing demands on the organization. The Fund\r\nhas succeeded in responding to these needs with a variety\r\nof policy and operational approaches. Evaluations that have\r\nbeen made tell us that recipient Governments have a\r\npositive attitude towards UNFPA’s overall contributions and\r\nthat they perceive UNFPA as a capable and reliable partner.\r\nFlexibility and adaptability in relation to individual\r\ncountries’ situations have become a trademark of the\r\nFund’s operations.\r\nThe impact of the activities of the Fund has been felt\r\nin several areas, of which I would like on this occasion to\r\nmention three. First, through information and dialogue,\r\nthe UNFPA has successfully promoted the importance of\r\npopulation as a critical issue in development. Fresh in\r\neverybody’s minds is UNFPA’s excellent contribution to\r\nand leadership in the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development in Cairo. Secondly, the\r\nFund has, in cooperation with national Governments,\r\nplayed an active role in launching and strengthening\r\npublic-sector population and family-planning programmes,\r\ncomplemented by important efforts from the non-\r\ngovernmental organization community. Thirdly, UNFPA\r\nhas played an important role in building institutional\r\ncapacity in many countries.\r\nHowever, since no organization is ever perfect, there\r\nis necessarily room for improvement in a number of\r\nareas. There is, for instance, a need to improve the quality\r\nof programmes and projects, capacity-building and\r\nprogramme sustainability. The strengths and weaknesses\r\nhighlighted in the independent evaluation report funded by\r\nFinland, Canada and Germany, provide an important input\r\nto the current debate on UNFPA’s future orientation and\r\nactivities.\r\nAn important guide for UNFPA’s future activities is\r\nthe lessons learned during its 25 years of operation. One\r\nsuch lesson, which UNFPA has already taken steps to\r\naddress, is the need to reorient traditional family planning\r\npolicies towards more integrated reproductive health care\r\npolicies. In this respect the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development represents an important and\r\nhistoric breakthrough.\r\nA second key lesson is that population and\r\ndevelopment programmes are most effective when steps\r\nsimultaneously have been taken to improve the status of\r\nwomen. On behalf of the Nordic countries, I would like\r\nto extend our appreciation for the role played by UNFPA\r\nin its efforts to improve the quality of life of the world’s\r\nwomen. UNFPA has helped to raise awareness about the\r\nrole of women and that women must be at the centre of\r\nthe reproductive health care process; women must\r\ntherefore be fully involved in the decision-making\r\nprocess, both within society and within the family.\r\nThese and other telling lessons constitute important\r\nparts of the Programme of Action adopted by the Cairo\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nConference. That Programme, formulated in a spirit of\r\nconsensus and international cooperation, provides a solid\r\nplatform for meeting the challenges ahead.\r\nThe Nordic countries have traditionally given high\r\npriority to the work of the Fund, and together we constitute\r\na group of major donors to UNFPA. Combined, the Nordic\r\nallocations to the Fund amount to about 30 percent of total\r\npledges in 1993. That testifies to our support for the\r\nactivities of the Fund.\r\nLet me conclude with a reminder that the challenges\r\nposed by the Cairo Conference, both to the United Nations\r\nsystem and to its member nations, are enormous and will\r\ncontinue to be so for many years to come. The Nordic\r\ncountries are therefore looking forward to working in close\r\npartnership with UNFPA under the skilful and inspiring\r\nleadership of Mrs. Sadik in implementing the Programme\r\nof Action of the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment. The Nordic countries will do their best to\r\nensure that agreed commitments are implemented in the\r\nbest possible manner in order to bring about development\r\nfor all.\r\nI reiterate our congratulations and wish Mrs. Sadik and\r\nher team every success in their important work.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Sher Afgan Khan of Pakistan, in his capacity as\r\nChairman of the Second Committee.\r\nMr. Khan (Pakistan) Chairman of the Second\r\nCommittee: It is a pleasure and an honour for me, as\r\nChairman of the Second Committee, to participate in\r\ntoday’s commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of\r\nthe operations of the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA).\r\nAs the assembly is aware, the Second Committee has\r\nhad a long association with the UNFPA. It has provided\r\nguidance to the Fund throughout its 25 years of operations\r\nand has watched with considerable admiration as the Fund\r\nevolved from a small trust fund into the dynamic\r\norganization that it is today.\r\nWhen UNFPA began operations one score and five\r\nyears ago, it had a tiny staff and less than $3 million in\r\nvoluntary contributions to work with. Two years later, this\r\nhad grown to $24 million and by the end of the third year,\r\nto $40 million. Its subsequent growth has been equally\r\nimpressive, reaching $129 million by the beginning of the\r\nsecond decade of its existence and passing the $216\r\nmillion mark 10 years later.\r\nThe Fund’s journey - perhaps appropriately enough,\r\ngiven the size and rate of growth of the continent’s\r\npopulation - began in Asia. And it is in Asia where\r\nUNFPA has arguably had its greatest impact and realized\r\nits greatest success. Indeed, many Asian countries now\r\nhave fourth- or fifth-generation population policies and\r\nprogrammes, and quite a few are sharing their experiences\r\nwith other developing countries through South-South\r\ncooperation arrangements.\r\nThat journey, however, has not always been a\r\nsmooth one. As evidenced at last month’s International\r\nConference on Population and Development, population\r\nissues can be extremely sensitive, especially in the light\r\nof different social, cultural, religious and legal settings.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council has thus made the\r\npromotion of awareness, in both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries, one of the Fund’s main aims and\r\npurposes. It is also why the multinational approach of\r\nUNFPA - being neutral and universal - has been so\r\neffective in building up knowledge and understanding of\r\npopulation issues and in promoting the formulation of\r\npopulation policies and programmes among a diverse\r\ngroup of countries the world over.\r\nThe consistent growth of UNFPA is a reflection of\r\nhow rapidly the international community recognized the\r\nimportance of population issues as an integral component\r\nof development and the indispensability of the Fund’s\r\nwork in addressing those issues.\r\nThe timing of today’s commemoration could not be\r\nmore auspicious. A little more than a month ago, at the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nsome 170 countries adopted the historic Cairo Programme\r\nof Action. The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mrs. Benazir\r\nBhutto, was a distinguished participant in the Cairo\r\nConference. Through her outstanding declaration in terms\r\nof moral, ethical and political principles, as well as\r\ncommitments to action, she made a major contribution to\r\nthe success of that Conference. That Programme of\r\nAction has the potential to change the world for the\r\nbetter. It places women and men and their families at the\r\ntop of the international development agenda. It puts\r\npeople first and brings women into the mainstream of\r\ndevelopment. It protects women’s health, promotes their\r\neducation, calls for their empowerment and encourages\r\nand rewards their economic contribution.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nThe Programme of Action, of course, was crafted by\r\nthe countries of the world, but the acceptance and\r\nendorsement of many of these issues owe much to the\r\noperations of UNFPA over the past 25 years. These\r\noperations have taken UNFPA into practically every\r\ndeveloping country in the world, where it has distinguished\r\nitself as a reliable and effective development partner, a\r\nvaluable source of technical assistance and a trusted friend.\r\nPakistan looks forward to an in-depth discussion of the\r\nagenda item on the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development to be held in the very near future in both\r\nthe General Assembly and the Second Committee. As\r\nChairman of the Second Committee, Pakistan is eager to\r\nwork with all the delegations on the implications of the\r\nhistoric and outstanding International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development.\r\nThe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) holds\r\nspecial significance for my country, Pakistan. Our long\r\nassociation with the Fund dates back to 1970, when we\r\nsigned our first country agreement with UNFPA for support\r\nfor our national family-planning programme. Indeed, my\r\ncountry is proud to have been one of the Fund’s first\r\ncooperating partners. UNFPA’s work in Pakistan is also a\r\nreflection of the relevance of its activities to the\r\ndevelopment efforts of countries.\r\nPakistan is now into its fifth UNFPA country\r\nprogramme. The Fund supports our efforts to expand\r\ndramatically the coverage of family-planning services\r\namong couples of reproductive age, especially in rural\r\nareas; to integrate family-planning services into all health\r\noutlets; and to recruit and train thousands of family-\r\nplanning field workers to provide door-to-door family-\r\nplanning services to the rural population. The fifth\r\nprogramme is also providing assistance to help the\r\nGovernment in its efforts to improve the status of women.\r\nThe nearly 25 years of cooperation between UNFPA\r\nand Pakistan are testimony to the manifold advantages of\r\nmultilateral assistance and, more specifically, to the lead\r\nrole UNFPA plays within the United Nations system in\r\nproviding such assistance in the field of population. It also\r\nably exemplifies the hallmarks of multilateral assistance,\r\nnamely, respect for national sovereignty, universality,\r\nunconditionality and flexibility. It shows as well that\r\nmultilateral assistance can be effectively tailored to the\r\npolicies and priorities of a country’s development strategy.\r\nThus, when we commemorate 25 years of UNFPA\r\noperations, we are also in essence celebrating the principles\r\nand practices of multilateralism.\r\nThe international community reconfirmed the\r\nimportance of population issues in Cairo last month and\r\ndefined such issues within the much broader context of\r\nsustainable human development. We therefore strongly\r\nfeel that by adopting a congratulatory draft resolution\r\ncommemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of UNFPA’s\r\noperations we will be reaffirming not only our\r\ncommitment to multilateralism but also our confidence\r\nthat UNFPA remains the lead agency within the United\r\nNations system to address population issues.\r\nThe people and Government of Pakistan deeply\r\nappreciate the role of the UNFPA. We hold its Executive\r\nDirector, Mrs. Nafis Sadik, in very high esteem and\r\nadmire her for her clear vision, professional excellence\r\nand dynamic leadership of the Fund. Our deep\r\nappreciation is also due to UNFPA’s dedicated staff for\r\ntheir hard work and commitment to making the world a\r\nbetter place in which to live.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall upon the representative of Japan, who will introduce\r\nthe draft resolution contained in document A/49/L.5.\r\nMr. Maruyama (Japan): It is my great honour and\r\nprivilege to be allowed to introduce the draft resolution\r\ncommemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the\r\noperations of the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA) on behalf of its many sponsors. In addition to\r\nthose whose names appear on the draft resolution, I am\r\npleased to inform the Assembly that the following\r\ncountries have become sponsors: Afghanistan, Australia,\r\nBelize, Botswana, Comoros, the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, Dominica, Fiji, Haiti, Kazakhstan,\r\nLesotho, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nigeria,\r\nPakistan, Papua New Guinea, Romania, the Russian\r\nFederation, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tajikistan,\r\nThailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda and\r\nVanuatu.\r\nThe UNFPA has come a long way in its efforts to\r\naddress the population issue, which is of such vital\r\nimportance to the entire international community.\r\nStarting out as a small Fund, it has grown as support for\r\nthe invaluable contribution it is making in this field has\r\nincreased, and its activities have expanded dramatically,\r\nboth in scale and in range. Today, the UNFPA is\r\nresponsible for about one third of all population assistance\r\nto developing countries, assistance that has made it\r\npossible for many of those countries to successfully\r\nformulate and implement their programmes.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nThe adoption of the Programme of Action at the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development at\r\nCairo was a milestone in our joint efforts to address the\r\npopulation issue. Formulated on the basis of past\r\nexperience, the Programme of Action calls for a holistic\r\napproach, one that works for progress on a wide range of\r\nfronts, including reproductive health/rights, gender equity,\r\npoverty alleviation, and the environment. It is a clear set\r\nof guidelines for the future.\r\nJapan believes that the UNFPA must continue to play\r\na major role in assisting countries in implementing the\r\nProgramme of Action. It accordingly pledges its full\r\nsupport to the Fund, and towards the same end it wishes to\r\npropose that the draft resolution be adopted by consensus.\r\nBefore concluding, my delegation would like to take\r\nthis opportunity to pay a tribute to the first Executive\r\nDirector of the UNFPA, the late Mr. Rafael M. Salas, and\r\nto join other delegations in commending Mrs. Nafis Sadik\r\nand her staff for their excellent work.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.5. I should like to announce that the following\r\ncountries have also become sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution: Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/49/L.5. May I take it that the Assembly\r\ndecides to adopt the draft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/49/L.5 was adopted\r\n(resolution 49/3).\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\ndeclare closed the commemoration of the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the operations of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund. I should like, on behalf of the\r\nAssembly, once again to congratulate Mrs. Nafis Sadik\r\nfor the excellent work she has done, along with her team,\r\nin heading the Fund following the demise of her\r\noutstanding predecessor, Mr. Rafael Salas. We offer Mrs.\r\nSadik our encouragement as she continues her work for\r\nthe benefit of all mankind.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.25 p.m.\r\n17\r\n"
