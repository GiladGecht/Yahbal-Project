(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 3\r\nCredentials of representatives to the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly\r\n(b) First report of the Credentials Committee\r\n(A/49/517)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Credentials\r\nCommittee appears in paragraph 10 of its first report.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider the draft\r\nresolution recommended by the Credentials Committee.\r\nWe shall first hear representatives who wish to\r\nspeak in explanation of vote or position on the\r\nrecommendation of the Credentials Committee. May I\r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are limited\r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from\r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): As the General Assembly is about to\r\napprove the first report by the Credentials Committee, as\r\nit appears in document A/49/517, the fact that my\r\ndelegation does not object to this report does not mean in\r\nany way that we recognize the credentials of the Israelis,\r\nbecause in spite of the latest developments regarding the\r\nPalestinian question, we do not find that this constitutes\r\nany comprehensive solution to this question, and that\r\nsuch solution will be achieved only by recognizing all\r\nthe rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among\r\nwhich is their right to return to their land, to exercise\r\nself-determination and to establish a democratic state in\r\nPalestine where Arabs and Jews live together, with\r\nAl-Quds as its capital.\r\nMr. Oulia (Islamic Republic of Iran): My\r\ndelegation would like to express its reservation\r\nregarding paragraph 10 of the first report of the\r\nCredentials Committee (A/49/517) on the credentials of\r\nIsrael. In line with the position of the Government of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran on the issue, my delegation\r\nwishes to dissociate itself from the parts of the said\r\nreport referring to the approval of the credentials of\r\nIsrael.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): We\r\nshall now take action on the recommendation of the\r\nCredentials Committee contained in paragraph 10 of its\r\nfirst report (A/49/517). The Committee adopted the\r\ndraft resolution without a vote. May I take it that the\r\nAssembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 49/4).\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): We\r\nhave thus concluded this stage of our consideration of\r\nsub-item (b) of agenda item 3.\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I wish\r\nto remind members that the deadline for submission, in\r\nwriting, of the views of Member States on Programme 6\r\nof the medium-term plan (Elimination of apartheid)\r\ncontained in document A/49/6 (Prog. 6) - which will be\r\ntransmitted to the Fifth Committee - is Wednesday,\r\n26 October.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 3.20 p.m. and resumed\r\nat 3.25 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 15\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nGeneral Assembly will now proceed to the election of five\r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council to replace\r\nthose members whose term of office expires on\r\n31 December 1994.\r\nThe five non-permanent outgoing members are the\r\nfollowing: Brazil, Djibouti, New Zealand, Pakistan and\r\nSpain. These five States cannot be re-elected and therefore\r\ntheir names should not appear on the ballot papers.\r\nApart from the five permanent members, the Security\r\nCouncil will include in 1995 the following States:\r\nArgentina, Czech Republic, Nigeria, Oman and Rwanda.\r\nThe names of those States, therefore, should not appear on\r\nthe ballot papers.\r\nOf the five non-permanent members which will remain\r\nin office in 1995 three are from Africa and Asia, one is\r\nfrom Eastern Europe and one is from Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean.\r\nConsequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963,\r\nthe five non-permanent members should be elected\r\naccording to the following pattern: two from Africa and\r\nAsia, one from Latin America and the Caribbean and two\r\nfrom the Group of Western European and Other States.\r\nThe ballot papers reflect this pattern.\r\nIn accordance with the established practice, there is an\r\nunderstanding to the effect that, of the two States to be\r\nelected from Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa\r\nand one from Asia.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the\r\nnumber of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats\r\nto be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a\r\ntwo-thirds majority of those present and voting will be\r\ndeclared elected.\r\nIn the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there\r\nwill be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates\r\nwhich have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\naccordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the\r\nelection shall be held by secret ballot, and there shall be\r\nno nominations.\r\nI now call on the representative of the Gambia as\r\nChairman of the Group of African States.\r\nMr. Jallow (Gambia): On behalf of the African\r\nGroup I am pleased to indicate that the African Group\r\nendorses the candidature of Botswana for the vacancy\r\nallocated to Africa in the Security Council.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Samoa as Chairman of the\r\nGroup of Asian States.\r\nMr. Slade (Samoa): As Chairman of the Group of\r\nAsian States Samoa is honoured to inform the General\r\nAssembly that the Republic of Indonesia is the endorsed\r\nand sole candidate for election to the non-permanent seat\r\nin the Security Council allocated to the Asian region for\r\nthe term 1995-1996.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Paraguay as Chairman of the\r\nGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States.\r\nMr. Fernandez Estigarribia (Paraguay)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): The delegation of Paraguay\r\nas Chairman of the Latin American and Caribbean Group\r\nfor this month has the honour of informing the General\r\nAssembly that the candidacy of the Republic of Honduras\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 20 October 1994\r\nis endorsed by the Group as the only candidate from our\r\nregion to become a member of the Security Council.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Canada as Chairman of the\r\nGroup of Western European and Other States.\r\nMrs. Fréchette (Canada) (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the Group of Western European and Other\r\nStates I wish to remind members of the Assembly that\r\nGermany and Italy are candidates for the two non-\r\npermanent seats in the Security Council allocated to our\r\nregion. The candidatures of these two countries, Germany\r\nand Italy, have been endorsed by our Group.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\naccordance with the rules of procedure, we shall now\r\nproceed to the election by secret ballot, taking into account\r\nthe statements made by the representatives of Gambia,\r\nSamoa, Paraguay and Canada.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now be\r\ndistributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed and to write on them the\r\nnames of the five States for which they wish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing the names of more States\r\nfrom the relevant region than the number of seats assigned\r\nto it will be declared invalid.
