(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.45 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 21\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/49/450)\r\nDraft resolution (A/49/L.6)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call on\r\nthe representative of Nicaragua to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.6.\r\nMr. Pallais Arana (Nicaragua) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this\r\noccasion and to put before the General Assembly for its\r\nconsideration draft resolution A/49/L.6, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States”.\r\nIt gives me great satisfaction to say that, as can be\r\ngleaned from the Secretary-General’s report, which was\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly in compliance with\r\nresolution 47/11, on the question of cooperation between\r\nthe two bodies, the cooperation that has been achieved in\r\nvarious arenas has not only been improved but constantly\r\nfine-tuned, coordinated better and made more effective.\r\nThe submission of the draft resolution, which is\r\nsponsored by 31 States in the Latin American region, is of\r\nsingular importance to Nicaragua, inasmuch as Nicaragua,\r\nthe rest of Central and Latin America and the Caribbean,\r\nacting in concert, have benefited directly from the various\r\nforms that the close cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of American States has\r\nassumed.\r\nEver since agreement was reached on the basic\r\nprocedures laid down by the Presidents of the Central\r\nAmerican countries in the context of the subregional\r\npeace process, and under General Assembly resolution\r\n42/231, cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS) has assumed\r\ntangible form in Central America — observation of the\r\nelectoral processes in Nicaragua and El Salvador; the\r\nSpecial Plan of Economic Cooperation for Central\r\nAmerica; and the provision of humanitarian assistance in\r\nthe event of natural disasters in our subregion. These are\r\njust a few of the areas in which there has been such\r\ncooperation.\r\nIt is important to highlight the fact that, following\r\nthe close cooperation between the two organizations up to\r\nthis point, the International Support and Verification\r\nCommission was set up and that the Commission’s most\r\nimportant activity has been that relating to the situation in\r\nHaiti.\r\nThe Secretary-General of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, Mr. César Gaviria Trujillo, in his\r\naddress to the Central American ecological Summit on\r\nsustainable development, which was held in Managua,\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nNicaragua, on 12 and 13 October of this year, said that,\r\nwith due protection of its own identity and characteristics,\r\nthe OAS would work hand in hand with the United Nations\r\nto see to it that the work that had been done would\r\ncontinue in a coordinated and joint manner.\r\nIt is important to stress that, in the case of Haiti, there\r\nhas indeed been real cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of American States. On the\r\nbasis of the offer made by the Secretary-General of the\r\nOrganization of American States, the Secretary-General of\r\nthe United Nations asked the OAS to participate in the\r\nInternational Civilian Mission in Haiti (MICIVIH). The\r\ncooperation and coordination of the two Organizations are\r\na clear example of what can be achieved when there is a\r\nreal desire and the political will to work together to solve\r\nproblems that deserve such action.\r\nNot only has cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of American States materialized in\r\nCentral America and in Haiti, as the Secretary-General says\r\nin his report; cooperation and coordination have also been\r\nachieved in a number of other countries in Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean, where there has been an intensification\r\nof joint action with the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the Pan-American Health\r\nOrganization (PAHO), the Economic Commission for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO) — to name just a few of the bodies\r\nconcerned.\r\nIn the light of those facts, draft resolution A/49/L.6\r\nspeaks in its preambular paragraphs of the Assembly’s\r\nhaving examined the report (A/49/450) of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States; taking into account the\r\nreports of the Secretary-General entitled \"An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment\" and \"An Agenda for Peace\"; and bearing in\r\nmind that the Charter of the United Nations provides for\r\nthe existence of regional arrangements and agencies for\r\ndealing with such matters relating to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security as are appropriate for\r\nregional action, and whose activities are consistent with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations.\r\nSimilarly, the preamble notes with satisfaction that\r\nthe second general meeting between representatives of the\r\nUnited Nations system and of the Organization of American\r\nStates was held at the headquarters of the OAS on 3 and 4\r\nMay 1993, and that a sectoral meeting on\r\nnatural disasters management was held in Barbados on 28\r\nand 29 April 1994.\r\nIn its operative part of the draft resolution, in\r\naddition to taking note with satisfaction of the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the OAS, expresses its satisfaction at the\r\nclose cooperation between the two organizations in the\r\njoint operations of the International Civilian Mission in\r\nHaiti.\r\nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations states\r\nin his report on the work of the Organization that in \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\" it was noted that in many cases\r\nregional arrangements or agencies possessed a potential\r\nthat should be utilized in serving the functions of\r\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking and\r\npost-conflict peace-building, and that it therefore\r\nrecommended greater involvement of regional\r\narrangements and organizations in United Nations\r\nactivities. This is why the draft resolution, in its\r\noperative paragraphs, also welcomes meetings between\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations and the new\r\nSecretary-General of the OAS and requests both\r\nSecretaries-General, or their representatives, to resume\r\nconsultations with a view to signing during 1995 an\r\nagreement for cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nFinally, the draft resolution, approving the\r\nconclusions and recommendations of the second general\r\nmeeting between representatives of the two organizations\r\nheld in May 1993, recommends that a third general\r\nmeeting be held in 1995 to continue this consultative\r\nprocess. It also requests the Secretary-General to submit\r\nto the General Assembly at its fifty-first session a report\r\non the implementation \"of the present resolution\" and\r\ndecides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-\r\nfirst session the item entitled \"Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of American States.\"\r\nThe delegation of Nicaragua and the other sponsors\r\nhope, in view of the importance of this subject and the\r\nneed for the General Assembly to express itself on so\r\nimportant an issue, that the draft resolution will be\r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): Before\r\nthe Assembly takes a decision on the draft resolution, I\r\ncall on the representative of the Secretariat.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nMr. Nordenfelt (Director of the General Assembly\r\nand Trusteeship Council Affairs Division) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): I should like to inform members that should\r\nthe General Assembly adopt draft resolution A/49/L.6,\r\nconcerning cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States, the Secretary-General\r\ndoes not anticipate that any programme budget implications\r\nwould arise.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): May I\r\ntake it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.6?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 49/5).\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): May I\r\ntake it that it is the wish of the Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 21?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda Item 29\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/49/382)\r\nDraft resolution (A/49/L.7)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call on\r\nthe representative of Peru to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.7.\r\nMr. Acha (Peru) (interpretation from Spanish): I am\r\nhonoured to deliver this statement on behalf of the\r\nAmbassador and Permanent Representative of Peru,\r\nMr. Fernando Guillén.\r\nI take pleasure in introducing draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.7, \"Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nLatin American Economic System\", which is sponsored by\r\nall the member States of the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem.\r\nThe chief purpose of the draft resolution is to\r\nstrengthen and expand cooperation between the United\r\nNations system and the Latin American Economic System\r\n(SELA). This cooperation will make it possible for us to\r\nface up to new problems with solutions integrating the\r\nglobal outlook of the United Nations and the specific\r\ninputs of regional bodies. Thus the draft resolution seeks\r\nto contribute to attaining the purposes of the United\r\nNations in our part of the world.\r\nThe economic and social development of our\r\ncountries is a priority, as reflected in the fundamental\r\npurposes of the Organization and in the decision to adopt\r\nan Agenda for Development. We think it right that the\r\nties of cooperation between the United Nations system\r\nand regional economic systems should be perfected and\r\nfurther strengthened.\r\nPrevailing trends in the global economy, reflected in\r\nthe globalization of economic activity and increasing\r\nlinks, are accompanied by the consolidation of regional\r\ngroupings. All of this points to a need for the\r\nOrganization to be continually in the vanguard of political\r\nand economic developments. A regional economic\r\nsystem such as SELA, with its two aspects - international\r\nconsultation and coordination and intraregional\r\ncooperation - may become the key to coordinating the\r\nglobal efforts of the international community and the\r\npractical implementation in each region of the decisions\r\nadopted.\r\nMr. Bhatia (India), Vice-President took the Chair.\r\nWe note that the United Nations budget is being\r\nearmarked more and more for activities involving peace-\r\nkeeping and the maintenance of international security,\r\nmatters of extreme importance that enjoy our\r\nunconditional support. All the same, there is a dangerous\r\nimbalance in terms of the accelerated decrease in funds\r\nearmarked for economic activities involving cooperation\r\nand the promotion of trade within the context of free\r\ncompetition, and for sustainable development, the basic\r\nvariables that we in the international community have\r\nbeen resolutely promoting.\r\nIn this sense it is appropriate for the United Nations\r\nto take advantage of the coordinated cooperation within\r\neach of the regional economic systems, taking advantage\r\nof their invaluable tactical capacity and infrastructure\r\ncapable of producing studies and analyses based on actual\r\nfacts. This joint effort will facilitate more specific\r\npolitical and diplomatic action. In an ever more\r\nspecialized world it is necessary for us to take advantage\r\nof the comparative advantages that may be offered by\r\nregional economic systems such as the Latin American\r\nEconomic System.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nNotwithstanding restrictions in terms of the availability\r\nof substantial additional finances, we can try to put forward\r\nimaginative proposals that would show where opportunity\r\nlies, so far as our countries are concerned, in stepping up\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and SELA.\r\nSpecific experience has already been built up and\r\nshould be explored further. The close cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\r\nSELA in technical cooperation among developing countries\r\nis a case in point. In that context we encourage the\r\ncontinued flow of resources into the UNDP programmes in\r\nsupport of SELA (project RLA/92/008), which is of such\r\nimportance in the carrying out of valuable studies for the\r\ncountries of Latin America and the Caribbean. These\r\nstudies relate to privatization, retrofitting and restructuring\r\nof businesses and the modernization of systems of\r\nproduction as strategic factors in competitiveness, as\r\npointed out in paragraph 27 of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport (A/49/382). We would ask the Secretariat to take\r\nnote of the need to earmark resources for the project just\r\ncited and the need to have this included in official reports\r\nof this session.\r\nThe preambular part of the draft resolution that I am\r\nsubmitting to the Assembly for its consideration makes\r\nspecial reference to the multiple activities carried on by the\r\nLatin American Economic System jointly with a variety of\r\nbodies throughout the United Nations system, as well as to\r\nthe implementation by SELA of priority economic\r\ndevelopment programmes for the countries in our region.\r\nIn the operative part of the draft resolution the\r\nAssembly would take note with satisfaction of the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, while urging the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean and\r\nUNDP to continue broadening and deepening their\r\ncoordination and mutual support activities with SELA. It\r\nwould urge the specialized agencies and other relevant\r\nbodies and programmes of the United Nations system to\r\nintensify their cooperation with the activities of this\r\nregional body. It would request the Secretary-General of\r\nthe United Nations and the Permanent Secretary of the\r\nLatin American Economic System jointly to assess the\r\nimplementation of the Agreement between the United\r\nNations and the Latin American Economic System and to\r\nreport thereon to the General Assembly at its fiftieth\r\nsession.\r\nTaking into account the fact that the draft resolution\r\ndoes not contain any elements that could be controversial,\r\nand the fact that it reflects the aspirations of the countries\r\nof Latin America and the Caribbean with regard to the\r\nexpansion and strengthening of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and SELA, the delegation of Peru,\r\nspeaking on behalf of all the co-sponsors — representing\r\nall the members of SELA — hopes that the draft\r\nresolution will be adopted by the General Assembly\r\nwithout a vote.\r\nMr. Gazmuri (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nFor a number of years the Latin American and Caribbean\r\ncountries have been sponsoring a draft resolution\r\nestablishing the basis for increasingly useful cooperation\r\nbetween the Latin American Economic System (SELA)\r\nand the United Nations system.\r\nEver since that body was set up to coordinate\r\nregional positions on economic issues, this group of\r\ncountries has shown a qualitative improvement in the way\r\nit articulates and upholds its interests. This process of\r\nharmonization has been improved through the cooperation\r\nthat SELA has been receiving from the United Nations.\r\nThat in turn spurs us on to emphasize the need to\r\nmaintain and further develop the cooperative ties between\r\nour two bodies.\r\nIn general, we can see that there has been a\r\nresurgence of economic growth throughout the world,\r\nstrongly supported by the success of the management of\r\nthe economies of developing countries, although these\r\nrepresent only 20 per cent of world output.\r\nTo the fact that the developing countries are indeed\r\ncontributing to a global growth recovery in the course of\r\nthis decade may be added the fact that ever since the last\r\ndecade this same group of countries has been a provider\r\nof financial flows to the industrialized world.\r\nIn this new economic scenario, marked in general by\r\nthe adoption of market-economy principles and\r\nprocedures, Latin America and the Caribbean have been\r\nfaced with the need to adapt the productive structures of\r\neach and every one of their countries to these new\r\ncircumstances. By the same token, the group will have to\r\ntake steps to adapt itself to the normative framework that\r\nhas grown out of the last round of trade negotiations of\r\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\r\nWe trust that these regional efforts will lead to\r\nmaximizing benefits that will bring about greater fluidity\r\nin international trade.\r\nJudging by statistics, the work done in the region has\r\nbeen positive in terms of the initial macroeconomic\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nresults achieved. This might provide an incentive for\r\ncontinued implementation of structural reforms in the\r\nregion. However, we must point out that in most instances\r\nthe cost in social terms, of the process of economic\r\nreadaptation has been extremely high.\r\nThe great challenge we face, a challenge we cannot\r\nsidestep, is to combine efforts to modernize and globalize\r\nour economies with the resolute fight against poverty and\r\nthe building of societies in which social equity and fairness\r\nwill be central objectives.\r\nThe overcoming, in a historically short time, of the\r\nextreme social imbalances that we face in our region is the\r\nsine qua non for sustained growth and democratic stability\r\nfor the region.\r\nNotwithstanding the signs that justify a more\r\noptimistic outlook for the prospects for trade, we have,\r\nunfortunately, noted the persistence of, and at times even\r\nthe upsurge in, protectionism in the major industrialized\r\nmarkets. That is why our region cannot trust only in the\r\ncapacity to improve its levels of trade competitiveness\r\ninternationally in order to achieve a successful entry into\r\nthe global economy.\r\nConsistent with what I have just said, we reaffirm the\r\nurgent need for greater cohesion, which will make it\r\npossible firmly to pursue the fight against protectionism the\r\nmajor consumer markets. We believe that this is the best\r\nway to ensure adequate access for our products into those\r\neconomies and, at the same time, achieve the equitable\r\nfunctioning of international trade.\r\nTrade in our region is being liberalized but the process\r\nwill succeed only if countries with developed economies\r\nfulfil the agreements reached in the latest Uruguay Round\r\nof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\r\nIn order for international trade to function properly\r\nthere must be evidence of political will on the part of the\r\nindustrialized world to adjust their economies to the norms\r\npromoted by the Bretton Woods institutions as they relate\r\nto fiscal deficits - in particular, as regards agricultural\r\nsubsidies.\r\nOnly by increasing international trade will it be\r\npossible to bring into the market major sectors of the\r\npopulation that now find themselves excluded from\r\nconsumption. The global resurgence of the global economy\r\nis closely intertwined with the progressive expansion of\r\nworld trade.\r\nIn order for us to meet these challenges, the\r\ntechnical support which the United Nations system can\r\nlend to coordination efforts within the context of the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System (SELA) is of paramount\r\nimportance.\r\nThis situation impels Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean to reaffirm their commitment to integration.\r\nWe are committed to improving the mechanism for the\r\nachievement of regional integration and to securing better\r\naccess for our countries in the emerging system of major\r\neconomic blocs.\r\nChile has been pursuing a consistent policy of\r\nintegrating its economy into global markets. It is a\r\ncountry open to the world which depends on trade with\r\nother countries for approximately 40 per cent of its gross\r\nnational product.\r\nThis policy of gaining access to the international\r\nmarket implies, as one of its basic elements, strengthening\r\nthe process of integration in our region. Consequently,\r\nwe propose pursuing an open regionalism that would\r\nallow us better to attune our various economies to the\r\ncharacteristics of the increasingly globalized economy. In\r\nthis sense, during the present administration of President\r\nFrei, we have redoubled our efforts to gain access to the\r\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR). Over\r\nrecent months we have stepped up negotiations with a\r\nview to finding appropriate terms to ensure more active\r\nparticipation by Chile in that mechanism.\r\nChile has also signed agreements on economic\r\nexchange and free trade with most of the countries of the\r\nregion. To date we have signed such instruments with\r\nMexico, Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia and Colombia, and\r\nagreements are now being negotiated with Ecuador and\r\nPeru. The programmes of mutual cooperation with the\r\ncountries of Central America have been strengthened.\r\nWe have also strengthened our ties with the\r\ncountries of the Caribbean by stepping up our political,\r\neconomic and cooperative relations.\r\nThis active policy of integration within Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean would go hand in hand with\r\nour efforts to achieve exchange agreements with other\r\nparts of the world, such as the Asia-Pacific region, where\r\nChile recently joined the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation Council (APEC). Talks have also begun\r\nwith a view to institutionalizing our economic relations\r\nwith the countries of the North American Free Trade\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nAgreement (NAFTA). Finally, together with other Latin\r\nAmerican countries, we are seeking new ways of\r\ncooperating with the European Union.\r\nMay I, in closing, reaffirm the importance of SELA in\r\nterms of regional participation in the new global economic\r\nscenario and may I also reaffirm the need for it to continue\r\nenjoying the support of the United Nations system in the\r\nefforts to this end.\r\nMr. Flores Olea (Mexico) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): As we approach the end of the century we are\r\nwitnessing great changes and transformations. It may be\r\nsaid that there is no area of human affairs that has not been\r\naffected by these dynamic changes. This situation has also\r\nbeen reflected in the work of the United Nations. New\r\nissues have been added to the list of economic items\r\ntraditionally on the agenda of the Organization, but we\r\nmust also recognize that we see an ever closer interrelation\r\nbetween the old and the new agenda. As a result, we\r\ncannot deal with these issues in isolation lest we find\r\nourselves taking a fragmentary and skewed approach,\r\nthereby gaining only a partial and fragmented view of the\r\nproblems.\r\nThe process of growing globalization and increased\r\ninterdependence in the international economy means that no\r\ncountry can afford the luxury of staying on the sidelines of\r\nthis constant process of transformation. Not to be involved\r\nwould result in the loss of opportunities and the stagnation\r\nof one’s national economy.\r\nThe countries of Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nhave been very closely involved in this process of\r\ntransformation, with a view to gaining more advantageous\r\naccess to the new international order.\r\nThis is not an easy undertaking. It requires a firm\r\npolitical will and, indeed, an intensive intellectual exercise\r\nto ensure that societies react in a timely and appropriate\r\nfashion to these new situations. As we travel down this\r\nroad, the Latin American Economic System (SELA) has\r\ndone an extremely important job analysing and evaluating\r\ntrends and formulating specific proposals to help us deal\r\nwith new challenges and take advantage of fresh\r\nopportunities.\r\nSince its creation almost 20 years ago, SELA has\r\ncontributed to making sure that Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean have a stronger presence in various international\r\nnegotiations and has striven to make sure that the region\r\ndiversifies as much as possible in its dealings with the rest\r\nof the world in order to promote regional cooperation and\r\nintegration. Indeed, this has been among its most signal\r\nachievements.\r\nWe should like to thank the Secretariat for its report\r\n(A/49/382) on this issue. It outlines the various activities\r\nwhich the United Nations system is carrying out jointly\r\nwith SELA. We note with satisfaction that this\r\ncooperation has intensified in the last few years.\r\nThe cooperation between SELA and the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean\r\n(ECLAC), particularly in promoting and strengthening\r\ndevelopment is concerned, is of particular interest. In this\r\nrespect, we should mention in particular the invaluable\r\nsupport SELA has received from the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). We take this\r\nopportunity to reaffirm how important it is to strengthen\r\nfurther such support.\r\nWe also wish to highlight the increased cooperation\r\non the part of SELA with other bodies throughout the\r\nUnited Nations system — in particular, the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) and the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO) — cooperation\r\nwhich is clearly reflected in trade, environmental,\r\ncommodities, industrial and development issues in\r\ngeneral.\r\nStudies such as those presented in \"An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment\" (A/48/935), and those submitted to the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and the United\r\nNations conference on industrial development, to mention\r\nbut a few, along with initiatives for the development of a\r\nmedium-term programme linking Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean on the one hand and Japan on the other in an\r\neffort to identify possible cooperative steps in various\r\nareas, together with the entry into operation of the\r\nintegrated system of external trade in the context of the\r\nLatin American Association of Industrial Design (ALADI)\r\nand the proposal to set up a practical annual course on\r\nCentral American integration are, inter alia, clear\r\ndemonstrations of the unambiguous commitment of SELA\r\nto strengthening and developing intraregional relations\r\nand to increasing the Latin America and the Caribbean\r\npresence throughout the world.\r\nThe work done by the twentieth meeting of the Latin\r\nAmerican Council of SELA enabled the countries\r\nmembers of SELA to engage in the necessary reflection\r\nabout the future of the Organization on its twentieth\r\nanniversary. It also enabled international experts to\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\ndiscuss the need to link SELA’s activities with efforts to\r\nmeet the new challenges facing Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean - the basic economic and social agenda of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nAgainst this backdrop and aware as we are of its role\r\nin facilitating consultation, coordination and cooperation\r\nbetween its member countries, we feel that SELA should\r\ncontinue to expand and intensify its cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations on issues of special interest to our region.\r\nThe experience of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand SELA clearly shows that today the combined efforts of\r\nthe regional and international bodies are a fundamental\r\nelement of development.\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): I am very pleased to be able\r\nto speak on agenda item 29 and to commend for the\r\nAssembly’s unanimous adoption of draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.7, which is now before it. I do so on behalf of the\r\ntwelve States members of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) that are members of the United Nations -\r\nnamely Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados,\r\nBelize, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis,\r\nSaint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and\r\nTobago, and my own country, Guyana.\r\nAs a regional organization linking the countries of the\r\nCaribbean and Latin America, the Latin American\r\nEconomic System (SELA) has grown in scope and\r\nmembership since its creation in 1975. We in CARICOM\r\ntake pride in welcoming as SELA’s newest member our\r\nsister CARICOM State of Belize.\r\nThe organization has now also proved itself capable of\r\nextending cooperation beyond our region. A recent\r\ndecision of the Latin American Council has given a\r\nmandate to forge links with the Republic of South Africa,\r\nin the context of economic and technical cooperation\r\nbetween developing countries. It will be recalled that\r\nearlier this year the General Assembly took the historic step\r\nof voting for the return of that country to our midst. The\r\ndecision of the Latin American Council therefore accords\r\nwell with the policies of the United Nations and the hopes\r\nand aspirations of the people of South Africa.\r\nCooperation between SELA and the United Nations\r\nis premised on the shared objectives of the two\r\norganizations in the promotion of peace, cooperation and\r\ndevelopment. The goals and responsibilities of SELA are\r\nin this respect comprehensive, while unfortunately its\r\nresources are somewhat limited. It was for this reason\r\nthat the initiative was taken for closer cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations. We in CARICOM are convinced that\r\nsuch cooperation can be to the benefit of the two\r\norganizations in their respective endeavours. Moreover,\r\nthe United Nations can undoubtedly, by virtue of its own\r\nexperience and expertise, assist SELA in the discharge of\r\nits mandates.\r\nThe recent meeting of the Latin American Council\r\nheld in Mexico City mandated its Permanent Secretariat\r\nto assist its member States in the provision of\r\ncoordinated, technical and analytical support for the\r\nspecific issues of drawing up an Agenda for Development\r\nand preparing for the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. Needless to say, both of these issues are\r\nof paramount importance in the matters on which we are\r\nfocusing at this Assembly session, and we in Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean would find such assistance of\r\nimmense value.\r\nIndeed in the execution of the mandate given to the\r\npresidency of the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly for the furtherance of work on the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, SELA, like many other regional and\r\nsubregional bodies affiliated with the United Nations,\r\nprovided a useful and welcome input for that process.\r\nThis single, but eloquent, example attests to the value of\r\nestablished cooperation between our two organizations.\r\nIn keeping with the Bolivarian vision of a united\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, SELA has been\r\nspecifically mandated to maximize dialogue and\r\ncooperation between its member States. This\r\nimprovement in relations will inevitably lead to the\r\nstrengthening of the regional and subregional integration\r\nprocesses, the achievement of greater economic\r\ncomplementarity and the enhancement of regional\r\nself-reliance. An important part of this objective for\r\nSELA will be the promotion of cooperation with the\r\nnewly established Association of Caribbean States.\r\nIn a region characterized by common goals and\r\naspirations, but often of competing interests, the role of\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nSELA in forging greater cooperation and coordination of\r\nour efforts is all-important. In the quest to achieve these\r\naims, its collaboration with the United Nations and its\r\nseveral agencies will be indispensable.\r\nMiss Duran (Venezuela) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): As the delegation of the host country of the\r\nLatin American Economic System (SELA), we wish once\r\nagain to express our commitment to the efforts made by the\r\nUnited Nations, through various specialized agencies and\r\nbodies, to guarantee and strengthen cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the Organization and SELA in areas\r\nof priority for the economic development of our region.\r\nAs the Secretary-General rightly points out in his basic\r\nreport, which is the premise for our discussion, the process\r\nof cooperation has intensified and become more diversified\r\nin terms both of SELA’s activities and of its ties to the\r\nUnited Nations. We would like to emphasize the\r\npromotion of greater participation in consultations among\r\nthe delegations of the Member States, which has been\r\nachieved through the presence of the observer\r\nrepresentative of SELA here at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters.\r\nVenezuela stresses the importance of this cooperation,\r\nwhich can only benefit our community. We call for the\r\nstrengthening of the support provided by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and the Economic Commission\r\nfor Latin America and the Caribbean for the programmes\r\nwhich the Permanent Secretariat is moving forward to\r\ncomplement its activities in support of the States members\r\nof SELA, as defined during the twentieth meeting of the\r\nLatin American Council, in Mexico City. Venezuela hopes\r\nthat these efforts will be pursued and, indeed, intensified,\r\nand that they will constitute a contribution by one and all\r\nto our region’s economic and social development.\r\nThe delegation of Venezuela takes pleasure in joining\r\nthe ranks of the co-sponsors of draft resolution A/49/L.7\r\nand trusts that it will be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 35/3 of 13 October 1980, I now call on the\r\nObserver of the Latin American Economic System.\r\nMr. De Rojas (Latin American Economic System)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): On behalf of the Permanent\r\nSecretariat of the Latin American Economic System (SELA),\r\nI should like to thank the States Members of the General\r\nAssembly for the draft resolution which is about to be\r\nadopted, and in particular to thank the representatives of\r\nPeru and the other Latin American and Caribbean\r\nmembers of SELA that have submitted it, as well as all\r\nthe others who have lent us their generous support. I\r\nappreciate also the statements that have been made here\r\ntoday by representatives of States Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAs the draft resolution makes clear, we are\r\nconvinced that implementing it will broaden and deepen\r\nthe collaboration and mutual support activities between\r\nthe United Nations and SELA. There are already many\r\nsuch activities as the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/49/382) indicates.\r\nIn fact, since the signing, three years ago, of the new\r\nAgreement on cooperation between the two institutions\r\nand the adoption of resolution 48/22, which is being\r\nreaffirmed today, we have seen continuous expansion of\r\ncooperative action and joint work, not only with the\r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean (ECLAC)and the various units of the\r\nSecretariat in New York and Geneva, but also with a\r\nvariety of other bodies and specialized agencies\r\nthroughout the system, such as the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development, the United\r\nNations Economic and Social Council and the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, as well as many others,\r\nincluding the Food and Agriculture Organization, the\r\nInternational Labour Organization, the United Nations\r\nIndustrial Development Organization, the World\r\nIntellectual Property Organization, the International\r\nMaritime Organization, the World Meteorological\r\nOrganization and the United Nations Centre for Human\r\nSettlements (HABITAT).\r\nI shall not try to list all the various activities\r\ninvolving cooperation between these entities — especially\r\nECLAC — as these are dealt with in detail in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. However, I should like to\r\nhighlight the invaluable support we have received from\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\nthrough the Regional Bureau for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean, as well as through the Special Unit on\r\nTechnical Cooperation among Developing Countries,\r\ninasmuch as these are referred to specifically in last\r\nyear’s resolution.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nIt is precisely the existing SELA-UNDP projects —\r\nparticularly regional project RLA/92/008 — that have\r\nfacilitated many of these various activities. We hope and\r\nexpect that the particular project to which I have referred\r\nwill be endowed with the resources necessary for\r\nsatisfactory completion — completion being scheduled for\r\nthe final year of the current programme cycle, which is\r\n1996.\r\nThe Latin American Council, which is the supreme\r\nbody in the Latin American Economic System, held its\r\ntwentieth annual regular meeting in Mexico City in June.\r\nOn that occasion the Council adopted the guidelines for the\r\nprogramme of work throughout the System for the ensuing\r\nyear, as well as a series of conclusions, decisions and\r\ndeclarations on issues of interest to the United Nations and\r\nincluded in the General Assembly’s agenda for its forty-\r\nninth session.\r\nThe report on the Council’s meeting will shortly be\r\nissued as an official document of the General Assembly. On\r\nthis occasion I should like briefly to highlight some of its\r\nfeatures to enable delegations to appreciate the variety and\r\nwealth of what is involved in the programme of work\r\ncurrently being implemented by the Latin American\r\nEconomic System with regard to its two key pillars —\r\nregional consultation and cooperation.\r\nThus it is that, for instance, with regard to \"An\r\nAgenda for Development\", the Latin American Council\r\nrecommended to the Permanent Secretariat that it continue\r\nto follow closely developments on related items,\r\nparticularly within the United Nations system, in close\r\ncontact with the delegations of the Member States that\r\nparticipate in the deliberations involved and carry out an\r\nanalysis of the state of affairs and the prospects with regard\r\nto relations between the countries in the region and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of these bodies and of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWith regard to the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, the Council requested the Permanent\r\nSecretariat to continue its cooperation with the Member\r\nStates and with the Preparatory Committee and, in due\r\ncourse, to arrange cooperation and coordination between the\r\ncountries of the region with a view to contributing to the\r\nimplementation of the Plan of Action that will be adopted\r\nin Copenhagen.\r\nThe Council also considered major issues, such as\r\nexternal debt, finance for development, international trade,\r\nmultilateral negotiations, industrial and technological\r\npolicy, intellectual property and economic relations with\r\ncountries and groupings outside the region, social\r\nproblems, food security, regional integration and the\r\nformulation of global economic action strategies for the\r\nregion as it deals with the global economy and faces new\r\nchallenges and processes throughout the world.\r\nTwo special decisions were adopted — one on the\r\nmatter of technical cooperation between developing\r\ncountries; the other on the\r\n“principal criteria and guidelines for the sixth\r\nprogramme cycle of the UNDP”,\r\nwhich include, among other things, the reaffirmation and\r\nenumeration of a series of normative principles and\r\noperative criteria, along with a decision to ensure active\r\nfollow-up to the negotiations in the sixth programme\r\ncycle and the corresponding elaboration of a regional\r\nprogramme for Latin America and the Caribbean, and the\r\nneed to seek an increase, for the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean region, in the financial and technical resources\r\navailable for international cooperation coming from both\r\nbilateral and multilateral sources.\r\nWe are confident that, with its programme of work,\r\nSELA is meeting the challenges of the new times, in\r\naccordance with the wishes of its member States, all of\r\nwhich will undoubtedly be strengthened by increasing\r\ncooperation with the rest of the international community\r\nand, in particular, with the United Nations system.\r\nMr. Kudryavtsev (Russian Federation)\r\n(interpretation from Russian): The Secretary-General’s\r\nreport (A/49/382) on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Latin American Economic System\r\n(SELA) is an excellent basis on which to discuss the\r\ndevelopment problems of this area. We agree with the\r\nSecretary-General that SELA’s cooperation with United\r\nNations programmes is constantly being increased and\r\ndiversified. This is certainly in the interests of the\r\ncountries of Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as\r\nthe rest of the international community.\r\nA good example of inter-organization cooperation is\r\nto be found in the practical results of the work of the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC) on economic, social, demographic\r\nand environmental problems. We hope that this activity\r\nwill continue and that cooperation between the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS) and the United\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nNations will expand through contacts between the OAS and\r\na large number of United Nations bodies. This would\r\ncertainly help the countries of the region to solve the whole\r\nrange of problems that confront them or to contribute to\r\ntheir consolidation through participation in the activities of\r\nregional organizations.\r\nThe process of regional integration is a characteristic\r\nof present-day development, and close interregional\r\ncooperation through international organizations is a most\r\nwelcome development.\r\nWe consider it a positive phenomenon that in the\r\nprocess of developing areas of the region due attention is\r\ngiven to economic questions. When decisions are being\r\nmade about how other problems might be moved towards\r\nsolution, in cooperation with the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies, including the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, it would be a good idea to take into account\r\nproblems arising from decisions relating to trade in raw\r\nmaterials and manufactured goods. This would make the\r\nwork more interesting and more practical and would be\r\nconsonant with the interests of the countries of Latin\r\nAmerica — indeed, of the international community as a\r\nwhole.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/49/L.7.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/49/L.7 was adopted (resolution\r\n49/6).\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of the\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 29?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 16\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other\r\nelections\r\n(b) Election of seven members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/49/259)\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly decision 42/450 of 17 December 1987, the\r\nGeneral Assembly elects the members of the Committee\r\nfor Programme and Coordination on the nomination of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nThe Assembly has before it document A/49/259,\r\nwhich contains the nominations of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee that\r\nwill occur as a result of the expiration on 31 December\r\n1994 of the terms of office of Bahamas, France, Ghana,\r\nthe Russian Federation, the United States of America,\r\nUruguay and Zambia. Those States are eligible for\r\nimmediate re-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that after 1 January\r\n1995 the following States will still be members of the\r\nCommittee: Argentina, Belarus, Brazil, Cameroon,\r\nCanada, China, Comoros, Congo, Cuba, Egypt, Germany,\r\nIndia, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan,\r\nKenya, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, the\r\nRepublic of Korea, Romania, Senegal, Togo, Trinidad and\r\nTobago, Ukraine and the United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Northern Ireland. Therefore, those 27 States\r\nare not eligible in this election.\r\nThe following States have been nominated by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council: two African States for two\r\nvacancies - Benin and Ghana; one Eastern European State\r\nfor one vacancy - the Russian Federation; two Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States for two vacancies -\r\nBahamas and Mexico; two Western European and other\r\nStates for two vacancies - France and the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\nThe number of States nominated from among the\r\nAfrican States, the Eastern European States, the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, and the Western\r\nEuropean and other States corresponds to the number of\r\nseats to be filled in each of those regions.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,\r\nall elections should be held by secret ballot. However, in\r\naccordance with paragraph 16 of decision 34/401, the\r\nAssembly may, in elections to subsidiary organs, dispense\r\nwith secret balloting when the number of candidates\r\ncorresponds to the number of seats to be filled.\r\nAccordingly, may I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto declare those States nominated by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council namely Bahamas, Benin, France, Ghana,\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nMexico, the Russian Federation and the United States of\r\nAmerica, elected members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination for a three-year term\r\nbeginning on 1 January 1995?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States that have\r\nbeen elected members of the Committee for Programme\r\nand Coordination.\r\nWe have concluded our consideration of sub-item (b)\r\nof agenda item 16.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.45 a.m.\r\n11\r\n"
