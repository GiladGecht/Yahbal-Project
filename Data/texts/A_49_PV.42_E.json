(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 89\r\nEnvironment and sustainable development\r\n(d) Elaboration of an international convention to\r\ncombat desertification in those countries\r\nexperiencing serious drought and/or desertification,\r\nparticularly in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/49/477)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreports of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee (A/49/84, Add.1, Add.2)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French):\r\nMembers will recall that at its 30th plenary meeting, held\r\non 13 October 1994, the Assembly decided to hold the\r\ndebate on this sub-item of agenda item 89 directly in\r\nplenary meeting, on the understanding that action on the\r\nsub-item would be taken in the Second Committee.\r\nIn connection with this sub-item, the Assembly has\r\nbefore it the report of the Secretary-General on the United\r\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those\r\nCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa: implementation of\r\nresolution 48/191 and possible requirements for future work\r\n(A/49/477), and a series of notes by the Secretary-General\r\ntransmitting the reports of the Intergovernmental\r\nNegotiating Committee for the Elaboration of an\r\nInternational Convention to Combat Desertification in\r\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa, on its third, fourth\r\nand fifth sessions (A/49/84 and Add.1 and 2).\r\nThe prosperity of future generations in a world\r\nwhere ecological balances will finally be protected was a\r\ncentral concern at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992.\r\nAmong the conclusions drawn and recommendations\r\nmade in Rio, one in particular has riveted the attention of\r\nthe international community: the recommendation in\r\nchapter 12 of Agenda 21 on the elaboration of an\r\ninternational convention to combat desertification. The\r\nimportance and the uniqueness of that recommendation lie\r\nin the nature of the instrument envisaged for its\r\nimplementation.\r\nIn fact, the preparatory process for the Rio Summit\r\nwas enriched by the concomitant negotiation of two\r\nextremely important Conventions: the Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change and the Convention on\r\nBiological Diversity. Those two Conventions now\r\nconstitute the international standard for what has come to\r\nbe known as the new generation of environmental\r\nconventions.\r\nThe United Nations Convention to combat\r\ndesertification falls within the framework of the follow-up\r\nto and implementation of the recommendations of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment (UNCED) and is strengthened by the\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nprinciple of sustainable development. This instrument is a\r\ncommitment in the form of a conventional commitment\r\nagreed on by the international community with the aim of\r\ncreating an appropriate legal framework to promote and\r\nimplement the principle of sustainable development in\r\nfragile ecosystems. Of course, the question of\r\ndesertification and its negative effects on the development\r\nefforts of countries that are seriously affected by it is not a\r\nsubject new to the United Nations system. However, so far\r\nthe approach, the operational framework and the\r\ninstitutional mechanisms used have not yielded results\r\ncommensurate with the scourge. Hence, we all hope that\r\nthis innovative approach inspired by the Rio consensus will\r\nlive up to the hopes placed in it by the deprived populations\r\nof arid areas.\r\nIt is fitting to hail here the work of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee, which has\r\nsuccessfully discharged the mandate entrusted to it in\r\nresolution 47/188 by adopting the Convention within the\r\nallotted time. We now need to ensure that all the desired\r\nconditions will be established for the effective\r\nimplementation of this instrument.\r\nWe trust that the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee, within the framework of its interim mandate\r\nand in the Conference of the Parties, will set up a financial\r\nmechanism and make viable institutional arrangements like\r\nthose relating to the Conventions on climate change and\r\nbiodiversity.\r\nHowever, the importance of this Convention is also\r\nreflected in its subject matter and its scope of application\r\nand intervention. Almost 900 million individuals are\r\ndeveloped and developing. In Africa alone, over the course\r\nof barely 50 years areas the size of countries have been\r\naffected by desertification. Even today, hundreds of\r\nthousand of hectares of fertile land are being inexorably\r\nlost because of desertification, which has intensified serious\r\nfood shortages, encouraged migratory movements and\r\nexacerbated political tensions.\r\nThese problems, closely linked to the process of\r\ndesertification, take on an even more tragic dimension in\r\nAfrica. Indeed, the international community has been aware\r\nof this fact, since it has specifically emphasized Africa in\r\nthe negotiating process. Furthermore, following the\r\nadoption of this Convention, the principle of urgent action\r\nfor Africa was decided on. This urgent action, which\r\nhighlights the priority given to Africa, must be implemented\r\nduring the interim period preceding the Convention’s entry\r\ninto force. In this regard, we must welcome the innovative\r\napproaches contained in the Convention — namely, the\r\n“bottom-up” approach, in which all those involved in\r\ncombating desertification are clearly associated with\r\npartnership agreements for the implementation of\r\nprogrammes of action at the national, subregional and\r\nregional levels.\r\nI am pleased, on behalf of the General Assembly, to\r\nthank the French Government for having agreed to\r\norganize the official signing ceremony in Paris, where 87\r\ncountries signed the Convention. I also solemnly appeal\r\nto all the States that were unable to do so in Paris to sign\r\nthis Convention, so important for Africa and the world,\r\nduring this session of the General Assembly.\r\nIn this connection, I wish to inform the Assembly\r\nthat the text of the Convention is now in the Treaty\r\nSection of the Department of Legal Affairs and that the\r\nConvention is open for signature, in accordance with its\r\narticle 33.\r\nI now call on the Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nMr. Kittani (Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on General Assembly Matters): As the Assembly\r\nknows, the Secretary-General left earlier today on a trip\r\nabroad. He asked me, first of all, to express his deep\r\nregret that he could not be here in person this afternoon\r\nto deliver his message and, secondly, to deliver it on his\r\nbehalf. His statement is as follows:\r\n“During an impressive ministerial-level\r\nceremony in Paris on 14 and 15 October, 87 nations\r\nand one regional organization signed the United\r\nNations Convention to combat desertification. The\r\nConvention had been adopted in June 1994 after\r\nonly 13 months of intensive negotiations. This was\r\neloquent testimony to the resolve of the international\r\ncommunity to promote sustainable development of\r\nthe world’s drylands in the framework of Agenda\r\n21.\r\n“At the signing ceremony, there were also over\r\n60 statements from Governments and high-level\r\nofficials of intergovernmental organizations outlining\r\nconcrete steps to implement the Convention\r\nimmediately in Africa. This is only proper, since\r\nthe Convention gives priority to Africa and since the\r\npeople of that continent, who are among the world’s\r\npoorest, suffer the most from the effects of dryland\r\ndegradation and drought.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\n“In fulfilling commitments made at the June\r\n1992 Earth Summit, the Convention breaks new\r\nground in international law concerning environment\r\nand development. It adopts for the first time a truly\r\nintegrated approach, stressing action at the community\r\nlevel and giving the economic and social dimensions\r\nof combating desertification equal weight to its\r\nphysical and biological aspects. It thus takes its place\r\nwith the climate change and biodiversity Conventions\r\nas a third pillar of the new sustainable-development\r\nparadigm.”\r\n“Among the innovative features of the\r\nConvention is a series of regional implementation\r\nannexes which provide guidance for a system of\r\nnational, subregional and regional action programmes.\r\nThese programmes will be developed in the\r\nframework of partnership agreements with bilateral\r\nand multilateral donors as well as with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. The Conference of the\r\nParties will oversee and review this system.\r\n“The Convention contains all the commitments\r\nnecessary to succeed in the fight to combat\r\ndesertification and mitigate the effects of drought. In\r\nthe end, the key to success will be the will of the\r\naffected countries themselves and of the international\r\ncommunity to implement the Convention effectively\r\nover the long term. Statements at the signing\r\nceremony gave every indication that this will is there:\r\nfirst, affected African countries stressed their primary\r\nresponsibility to initiate national action programmes,\r\nor restructure existing ones. They also exhibited their\r\nstrong interest in working with neighbouring nations\r\nin elaborating subregional action programmes. Many\r\nalso highlighted specific steps to inform their\r\npopulations about the significance of the Convention\r\nand to set up appropriate procedures and institutions\r\nto make action programmes a reality.\r\n“OECD countries on the other hand emphasized\r\nthe high priority they give to urgent action in Africa\r\nand their intention to participate fully in consultative\r\nprocesses leading to partnership agreements. Many\r\nalso indicated the magnitude of funding available for\r\ninterim action along with specific programme\r\ninitiatives. While it is not possible to give a precise\r\nfigure, it appears that up to $2 billion will be available\r\nto support Convention implementation in Africa over\r\nthe next two to three years.\r\n“Latin American and Asian countries showed\r\ngenuine enthusiasm for sharing experience and\r\ntechnical expertise with African countries.\r\n“United Nations agencies and other\r\ninternational organizations concerned with combating\r\ndesertification uniformly pledged to be full partners.\r\nThey also described concrete programme initiatives\r\nthey were taking immediately.\r\n“I myself am committed to mobilizing\r\nsufficient funds and to ensuring the full involvement\r\nof all agencies in the United Nations family.\r\n“We should now do everything possible to\r\nbuild on the momentum which the signing ceremony\r\ngenerated. First and foremost, I urge all countries\r\nwhich have not signed the Convention to do so in\r\nNew York as soon as possible.\r\n“Secondly, I hope that a strong consensus will\r\nemerge in the Second Committee on a resolution\r\nwhich will allow the International Negotiating\r\nCommittee to continue its work during the period\r\nbefore the first meeting of the Conference of the\r\nParties and which will permit the Interim Secretariat\r\nto support the Committee.\r\n“Lastly, we must all work assiduously to\r\npromote ratifications of the Convention in order to\r\nensure its early entry into force. This unique legal\r\ninstrument bears great promise. It is up to all of us,\r\nworking together, to guarantee that it lives up to the\r\nhigh expectations.”\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I wish\r\nto inform delegations that there are approximately 30\r\nspeakers on the list of speakers for this item. I should\r\nlike to propose, therefore, that the list be now closed. If\r\nI hear no objection it will be so decided.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on Ambassador Bo Kjellén of Sweden, Chairman of\r\nthe Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nMr. Kjellén (Sweden), Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee (interpretation from French): It is with special\r\nsatisfaction that I speak under your presidency this\r\nafternoon. It will be recalled that this process began with\r\na decision taken by Ministers of Environment in Africa, in\r\nthe capital of your country in November 1991. An\r\ninitiative to launch negotiations was then resumed under\r\nChapter 12 of Agenda 21. But the road to Paris began in\r\nAbidjan.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI am pleased to have the opportunity to present the\r\nresult of the negotiation of the Convention to combat\r\ndesertification to-day. As will be recalled, this negotiation\r\nwas based on a decision by the General Assembly in 1992\r\n(resolution 47/188) following the adoption of Agenda 21,\r\nchapter 12, in Rio de Janeiro. A negotiating committee\r\nwas established with the task of negotiating a convention by\r\nJune 1994. It is obviously with great satisfaction that I can\r\nnow report that we were able to meet the time-limit and\r\nthat this Convention is now taking its proper place as one\r\nof the three major legal instruments linked to the Rio de\r\nJaneiro process. The Convention is before the Assembly.\r\nWe had very little time for the completion of the\r\nnegotiation: as will be recalled the first negotiating session\r\nwas held in Nairobi in late May 1993.\r\nThanks to the competence and the hard work of the\r\nsecretariat of Mr. Arba Diallo and to the constructive\r\nefforts of all negotiators we were able to negotiate a robust\r\nConvention, which has already, as you, recalled, Sir, been\r\nsigned by 87 countries at the ceremony organized by the\r\nFrench Government in Paris just a few days ago. Let me\r\nrecord here my gratitude to the Government of France for\r\nits readiness to receive the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee for both the final negotiating session and the\r\nsigning ceremony. The participation of so many eminent\r\npersonalities in Paris, the substantial contents of the\r\nstatements, comment on which we have just heard, and the\r\ngeneral atmosphere of this perfectly organized event — all\r\nbodes well for the future of the Convention as does the\r\ninterest that was taken by all representatives of the regional\r\ngroups who participated in the negotiation. I am very\r\ngrateful to all the friends who made this possible.\r\nWhen I speak of a robust Convention, I refer in the\r\nfirst place to its coherence and legal consistency. It was\r\nindeed negotiated rapidly, but legal experts were reviewing\r\nthe text as we went along and enabled us to arrive at a\r\nsatisfactory document. Secondly, I believe that we have\r\nmanaged to strike a reasonable balance between the\r\nperception of desertification as a global problem and the\r\nobvious need for specific recognition of regional\r\ndifferences. The four regional annexes, which form an\r\nintegral part of the Convention, give a special character\r\nto this Convention and form a bridge to the concrete\r\nimplementation on the ground. Thirdly, I think that there\r\nis an innovative aspect of this Convention which might\r\nenhance its impact on the real world: the provisions for\r\nscientific cooperation and networking are part of a\r\nconscious effort to create a dynamic instrument of\r\nchange.\r\nWhat about the financial resources? No doubt the\r\nnegotiation would have been easier if there had been\r\nample new financing available. No doubt there was\r\ndisappointment over the relative lack of precision in the\r\nfinancial provisions of the Convention. But I see no\r\nreason to underestimate what has been achieved in a\r\nperiod of heavy budgetary constraints and a general\r\natmosphere of austerity. The global mechanism foreseen\r\nin the Convention may well turn out to be a very useful\r\ninnovation and the notion of partnership and more\r\nefficient coordination in development cooperation may\r\nwell lead to notable concrete achievements.\r\nIt would take me too long to go into a detailed\r\npresentation of the Convention. Let me just refer to two\r\nmore features which in my view are essential. First is the\r\nbottom-up approach — enhanced respect for the local\r\nlevel and for the millions of men and women who live in\r\nthe dry lands. The Convention can be a success only if\r\ntheir experience and expertise are fully taken into account.\r\nThe second point is the integrated approach. We now\r\nrealize that the problems of the dry lands need to be\r\ntackled with a whole range of measures, integrating land\r\nmanagement, water management and energy needs while\r\ntaking fully into account relevant socio-economic factors.\r\nSuch issues as social structures, land ownership,\r\neducational and training facilities, local markets, transport\r\nand communications need to be given full attention and\r\nforged into powerful programmes of regional policy.\r\nIt is certainly my hope and expectation that many\r\nmore countries will soon sign the Convention here in\r\nNew York and that ratification procedures will move\r\nquickly. Nevertheless, it will take a certain amount of\r\ntime before the Convention can enter into force. I recall\r\nthat 50 ratifications are needed. But one characteristic of\r\nthis Convention is the urgency of the problem. We are\r\nnot just dealing with long-term problems here. As will be\r\nrecalled, 900 million people are living in the dry lands,\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nand many of those face absolute poverty. There is no time\r\nto lose.\r\nThe situation in Africa is particularly worrying, and it\r\nis therefore logical that the Convention gives particular\r\npriority to Africa. This is expressed in the detailed African\r\nannex and in the resolution on urgent action for Africa,\r\nwhich calls for steps to prepare national and subregional\r\naction programmes and recommends the establishment of\r\npartnership arrangements in the affected African countries.\r\nDeveloped countries as well as international and multilateral\r\norganizations, agencies and programmes are also invited to\r\nprovide enabling funds to support partnerships at the\r\nnational and subregional levels. In fact, the urgent action\r\nfor Africa is an expression of solidarity with populations\r\nwho live under extremely difficult conditions, but it is also\r\na test run for the methods of cooperation under the\r\nConvention.\r\nAs the Secretary-General stated, many countries have\r\nindicated their willingness to participate in this action, and\r\nit will be a major task for the Intergovernmental\r\nNegotiating Committee to support it during the interim\r\nperiod.\r\nIt is therefore also important to draw the attention of\r\nthe General Assembly to the second resolution adopted by\r\nthe Committee in June — the resolution on interim\r\narrangements. It aims at enabling the Committee to\r\ncontinue its work until the first session of the Conference\r\nof the Parties. To this end, the Secretary-General is invited\r\nto make the necessary proposals and recommendations to\r\nthe Assembly on future sessions of the Committee and the\r\nnecessary secretariat support. These are before the\r\nAssembly in document A/49/477.\r\nThe General Assembly will have to adopt a draft\r\nresolution on the basis of this report. Consultations are\r\nalready under way, and I trust that the draft resolution will\r\nnot be controversial. Its contents will reflect the consensus\r\nachieved in Paris in June, and the procedure follows closely\r\nthe one adopted with regard to climate change in 1992.\r\nThis means that the General Assembly is invited to\r\nagree on the convening of further sessions of the\r\nCommittee in 1995 and 1996 and the continuation of the\r\ninterim secretariat to provide the necessary support for the\r\nwork of the Committee. A number of United Nations\r\nagencies and programmes would also be invited to expand\r\ntheir support for the Convention, and the importance of\r\ncontinued contributions to the voluntary funds would be\r\nunderlined.\r\nIt will be recalled that last year the General\r\nAssembly made provision for one session of the\r\nCommittee after the conclusion of the Convention. This\r\nsession will begin in New York on 9 January 1995. The\r\nprovisional agenda for the sixth session of the Committee\r\nwas adopted in Paris in June. The two main items refer to\r\nthe work programme for the interim period and to the\r\npreparation of the first session of the Conference of the\r\nParties. No doubt these two clusters of issues will be with\r\nus for the whole interim period. The agenda for the first\r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties will be a heavy\r\none and in the interim the Committee will have the duty\r\nto review progress on the urgent action for Africa and to\r\nbe concerned with the situation in other dry land regions,\r\nsuch as the alarming situation in the Aral Sea Basin,\r\nwhere a major environmental and human disaster has to\r\nbe tackled.\r\nWith regard to the January session of the\r\nCommittee, I wish to highlight another issue of particular\r\ninterest to the General Assembly, one which was\r\ndiscussed in the Second Committee this week. It concerns\r\nthe Committee’s role in helping to prepare the third\r\nsession of the Commission on Sustainable Development,\r\nto be held in April 1995. According to the thematic work\r\nprogramme adopted in 1993, this session of the\r\nCommission will deal with all matters relating to land,\r\nreflected in chapters 10 to 16 of Agenda 21. As task\r\nmanager, the United Nations Environment Programme\r\n(UNEP) is preparing the main document for this\r\ndiscussion. But the Committee should take the\r\nopportunity — and the responsibility — to discuss\r\ndesertification and drought in the framework of an\r\nintegrated approach to land use, with the ultimate\r\nobjective of achieving long term food security for a\r\nrapidly growing world population.\r\nIt is unavoidable that a statement of this kind\r\nbecomes — if I may use the expression — rather dry.\r\nBut, in concluding, let me become a little more personal.\r\nCarl Sandburg once wrote:\r\n“The Republic is a dream.\r\nNothing happens unless first a dream.”\r\nThis Convention first seemed like a dream to those of us\r\nwho were struggling with chapter 12 of Agenda 21 here\r\nin New York in March 1992. We had the initiative to\r\nwhich I have already referred, taken by the African\r\nMinisters of Environment in Abidjan in late 1991, as a\r\npoint of departure. But there was no way of knowing\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nwhether this particular dream would ever materialize. Now\r\nthe Convention is before us. It is a source of great\r\nsatisfaction and at the same time a source of concern,\r\nbecause this time the international community must not fail\r\nin the implementation phase.\r\nTherefore, I warmly welcome this debate in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. It underlines the importance of the\r\nConvention and its essential role in the follow-up to the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment. The Convention supports and is supported by\r\nthe overall concept of sustainable development. It supports\r\nand is supported by the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, the other Conventions and the great thematic\r\nConferences — in particular, the Fourth World Conference\r\non Women, to be held in Beijing next year.\r\nBut the impact of the Convention can be felt only if\r\nit is well known. I suggest that a major effort is needed to\r\nprovide information and to make people aware in both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, and I would welcome\r\nimaginative proposals on how this could best be\r\naccomplished.\r\nThe Convention must lead to real action on the ground\r\nfor the benefit of the people living in the dry lands. It must\r\nalso be a dynamic factor in promoting research and\r\nreflection on the broad issues related to the vast dry lands\r\nof the planet.\r\nFinally, I wish to underline the political importance of\r\nour endeavour. Because peace is indivisible, conflicts may\r\narise out of the problems of the dry lands; scarce water\r\nresources can be the cause of war; impossible human\r\nconditions may lead to uncontrollable migration. This\r\nConvention is just one of the instruments for peace and\r\nsustainable development. But it is there now, ready to be\r\nused.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I would\r\nlike to draw the attention of the Assembly to agenda item\r\n43, entitled “Restructuring and revitalization of the United\r\nNations in the economic, social and related fields”.\r\nMembers will recall that at the 105th plenary meeting\r\nof its forty-eighth session, the General Assembly adopted\r\ndecision 48/507 to extend into the current session the\r\nconsultation process that had been initiated during the forty-\r\neighth session regarding resources for operational activities\r\nfor development. The aim of the process was to address the\r\nfinancing needs, with a view to reaching concrete results\r\nas soon as possible and no later than June 1995.\r\nIn accordance with decision 48/507, I have requested\r\nHis Excellency Mr. T. P. Sreenivasan of India to chair on\r\nmy behalf the consultations, which should take place as\r\nsoon as possible, indeed beginning this month.\r\nAgenda item 89 (continued)\r\nEnvironment and sustainable development\r\n(d) Elaboration of an international convention to\r\ncombat desertification in those countries\r\nexperiencing serious drought and/or\r\ndesertification, particularly in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/49/477)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreports of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee (A/49/84, Add.1, Add.2)\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Allow me first of all to extend, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation that are members of the Group of 77, on\r\nbehalf of the delegation of China and on my own behalf,\r\nwarmest congratulations to Ambassador Bo Kjellén of\r\nSweden, Chairman of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee for the Convention that is the subject of our\r\ndiscussion, on his excellent introductory statement. I am\r\npleased to tell him that I highly value the great\r\ncommitment, perseverance and competence he showed in\r\nconducting the negotiation process, with a dynamic\r\nBureau and an effective secretariat, led by my friend Arba\r\nDiallo, at his side. This process led to the fortunate\r\noutcome that we all welcome today: the signing by 87\r\ncountries on 14 October in the French capital of the\r\nInternational Convention to Combat Desertification in\r\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa. The conclusion of\r\nthat Convention and its annexes gives us a legal\r\nframework within which we can now take\r\nmultidimensional action with a view to slowing the pace\r\nof, if not totally stopping, one of the most serious forms\r\nof deterioration of our natural environment, and to\r\nexerting resolute efforts to reverse this trend by dealing\r\nwith problems of development, which underlie the very\r\nframework of the Convention.\r\nMr. Mwaunglu (Malawi), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nIn this regard, this Convention — and in the particular\r\ncontext of this discussion I shall not speak of certain limits\r\nthat it places on the aspirations and proposals of developing\r\ncountries — is part of the heritage of the Earth Summit and\r\nshould be viewed from the perspective of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. This demonstrates the highly political import\r\nof this Convention, like those on climate change and\r\nbiodiversity, as a significant contribution to the\r\nstrengthening of the creative partnership between the\r\ndeveloped countries and those affected by desertification\r\nand drought — this dual phenomenon that was\r\nappropriately identified by the United Nations Conference\r\non Environment and Development as being environmentally\r\nglobal in nature.\r\nThe outstanding political determination shown by the\r\nvarious parties to the negotiation is a valuable asset from\r\nwhich we should now launch our enterprise of\r\nimplementing the commitments entered into. In this regard,\r\nthe credibility of the partnership enshrined by this\r\nConvention will obviously be determined, to a large extent,\r\nby the mobilization of sufficient new and additional\r\nfinancial resources and the transfer of ecologically sound\r\ntechnologies for the benefit of the developing countries.\r\nThe establishment of the global financial mechanism\r\nprovided for in article 22 of the Convention will be, from\r\nthis standpoint, an important first step towards taking\r\nadequate measures to combat desertification. We must\r\ntherefore resolutely pass to the stage of action and see to\r\nit that this Convention does not meet the sad fate that befell\r\nthe Nairobi Programme of Action.\r\nI should also like to note with appreciation and\r\noptimism the political support shown for the Convention\r\nduring the signing ceremony last week in Paris, and the\r\nfinancial commitments already announced by some of our\r\npartners. I hope that we shall soon witness a collective\r\nsurge of responsibility and solidarity, which will quickly be\r\nmanifested by contributions to, among other things, the two\r\nspecial funds that operate within the mandate of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee.\r\nAlthough the phenomenon of desertification\r\nunfortunately spares no continent, it is Africa that has been\r\nravaged to the greatest extent. In fact, more than 60 per\r\ncent of Africa’s land is arid or semi-arid, and more than\r\nhalf its surface suffers from a lack of rainfall; the\r\npersistence of this situation leads each year to a further\r\nencroachment of the desert, thereby threatening the\r\nexistence of almost 185 million human beings and\r\nrendering all efforts to protect and restore the soil\r\nextremely difficult and costly. Affecting more than 40\r\ncountries on the African continent, desertification\r\nirreversibly swallows up some 6 million hectares every\r\nyear, diminishing their productive capacity — indeed,\r\nmaking them totally sterile. Because of this, almost 65\r\nmillion hectares of African land, formerly verdant, have\r\nbeen taken over by the desert on the southern border of\r\nthe Sahara alone over the past 50 years.\r\nThe serious effects of this scourge on both the\r\nenvironment and the population led to the convening in\r\n1977 in Nairobi of the United Nations Conference on\r\nDesertification and the adoption there of the United\r\nNations Plan of Action to Combat Desertification.\r\nUnfortunately, for lack of sufficient financial resources,\r\nthis Nairobi Plan of Action did not go beyond the stage\r\nof a simple statement of intent.\r\nHope has now been reborn with the promising\r\nConvention whose conclusion the General Assembly hails\r\ntoday. But while we await the entry into force and the\r\nsystematic implementation of this important global\r\njuridical instrument, the international consensus in favour\r\nof specific emergency assistance to Africa must be put\r\nfully into effect as quickly as possible, so that the African\r\ncontinent may play a pioneering role in the international\r\ncommunity’s counter-attack against the challenge of\r\ndesertification.\r\nA turning-point was reached in Paris last week, and\r\nanother begins today. We should first of all see to it that\r\nthere is no delay in the signatory States’ ratification of\r\nthis Convention, which bears a message of hope and\r\nsolidarity, so that we can identify as quickly as possible\r\nthe concrete action to be taken in the field. In addition,\r\nthe Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee should be\r\nmandated to continue and intensify its task to that end.\r\nAbove all, the International Convention to combat\r\ndesertification and drought should give rise to a true spirit\r\nof cooperation, based on the partnership between the\r\ncountries of the North and those of the South; this\r\npartnership — which today links the developed countries\r\nand the affected developing countries on the basis of the\r\nprinciple of common, but also differential,\r\nresponsibility — should open up new prospects for\r\ninternational cooperation in preserving the ecological\r\nbalance of the Earth as the common heritage of the\r\ncurrent and future generations.\r\nMr. Henze (Germany): I am speaking on behalf of\r\nthe European Union, and Austria.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nI should like first to join the Chairman of the Group\r\nof 77 in congratulating Ambassador Kjellén for his work on\r\nthe Convention. His great efforts, deep engagement and\r\npersistence greatly contributed to the success of the\r\nnegotiations, which, as we all know, were sometimes rather\r\ndifficult.\r\nThe European Union feels that, two years after the Rio\r\nConference on Environment and Development, we are now\r\nable to register important progress in the area of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The Convention to Combat Desertification in\r\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa, is an important\r\nmilestone in this process. The European Union was\r\ndetermined to shape actively the negotiating process leading\r\nto this Convention from the very beginning. We are pleased\r\nthat the final text was opened for signature just one week\r\nago in Paris, on 14 October 1994.\r\nAlong with the Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange and the Convention on Biological Diversity, a third\r\nimportant Convention arising out of the Rio Conference in\r\nthe field of sustainable development has thus been\r\nsuccessfully concluded. It is an integral part of the\r\nemerging framework of legally binding conventions and\r\nconcrete action plans for sustainable development. We will\r\nhave to continue on this road to tackle these urgent\r\nproblems of humanity. It is a good example of how to\r\nmaintain the right balance between development and\r\nenvironment concerns.\r\nWhen we all initiated the negotiating process towards\r\nthe present Convention during the forty-seventh session of\r\nthe General Assembly, we knew how important the role of\r\nthe Bureau of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee\r\nand the corresponding support of the Secretariat of the\r\nUnited Nations would be. The Bureau, under the\r\nchairmanship of Ambassador Bo Kjellén, and the secretariat\r\nof the Committee deserve our deep gratitude for having\r\nwisely guided our deliberations. It was their personal\r\ncommitment which helped us to negotiate the necessary\r\ncompromises.\r\nSpeaking on behalf of the European Union and\r\nAustria, I am proud to underline that the European part in\r\nthe negotiations was the result of a successful community\r\nexercise. The respective European Union presidencies of\r\nDenmark, Belgium and Greece, which led the European\r\nUnion in these negotiations with enormous commitment,\r\ncontributed to the successful conclusion of the negotiations.\r\nI further wish to thank the President of France and his\r\nGovernment, who, apart from their most valuable input into\r\nour Community deliberations, made it possible to sign the\r\nConvention in Paris.\r\nThe fight against desertification is a central element\r\nin our development cooperation. The European Union has\r\nlong been responsible for approximately 50 per cent of\r\nglobal development cooperation. With regard to Africa,\r\nthis percentage is even higher, at 62 per cent. The funds\r\nallocated for this purpose, in accordance with the Lomé\r\nConvention, in 1992 alone amounted to $1.9 billion. Since\r\nthen, another $434 million have been promised to be\r\nmade available from the Commission programmes for\r\ndesertification schemes and forest and rural development\r\nprogrammes.\r\nDespite all these efforts, however, we must realize\r\nthat the situation of 900 million affected people has not\r\nimproved as much as would be desirable and in some\r\ncountries has even deteriorated. The lack of concrete,\r\ncause-oriented and effective programmes to combat\r\ndesertification must be overcome. Too often, individual\r\nprojects have been geared only towards clearing up\r\nsymptoms while the actual causes and framework\r\nconditions which determine the conduct of land-users\r\nhave not been sufficiently taken into consideration. Clear\r\nrights regarding soil ownership are very often the\r\nprerequisite of a form of land-use planning that promotes\r\nsustainable development. All parties to the Convention\r\nshould therefore agree to make the fight against the root\r\ncauses of desertification a primary focus of their\r\nnegotiations.\r\nAs a consequence, the struggle against desertification\r\nhas been given a new approach in the Convention. The\r\nEuropean Union shares the confidence of its partners in\r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America that we have jointly\r\nlearned the lessons of the past during the 18 months of\r\nnegotiations. We feel that the process of elaborating\r\nnational action programmes in developing countries is of\r\nthe utmost priority. We are committed to continuing our\r\nassistance within the established framework. All those\r\ninvolved have to join forces. We believe that realistic\r\naction programmes that intimately involve the concerned\r\npopulations are the best guarantee for a successful fight\r\nagainst desertification. The Convention offers the\r\nopportunity to implement integrated, coordinated and\r\ncoherent programmes at the national and subregional\r\nlevels. The session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee scheduled for January 1995 should be able to\r\nput this process on track. The call is for specific answers\r\nto the concrete tasks of sustainable development and the\r\nregional implementation of Agenda 21.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nA closely coordinated effort of donor countries and\r\naffected developing countries is imperative. A quick follow-\r\nup to the signing of the Convention, in particular the\r\nresolution on urgent action for Africa, must be ensured.\r\nTogether we must create the conditions to improve the\r\ntranslation of action programmes into reality. Furthermore,\r\nthe Conference of the Parties should be speedily prepared.\r\nThe fight against desertification is a critical element of\r\nsustainable development of global dimensions, in that it\r\naffects all regions of the world, including developing and\r\ndeveloped countries. As a consequence, some of the\r\naffected countries of the European Union have assumed the\r\nparticular obligation for implementing the Convention in the\r\nform of a special Annex applying to the Northern\r\nMediterranean countries.\r\nThe Commission on Sustainable Development will\r\naddress the issues of desertification together with those of\r\nsustainable land use, biodiversity and forests during its next\r\nsession in 1995. As the discussion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment on the international level has become more\r\nand more concrete over time, we will have to deal with\r\nthese issues in an integrated way to achieve a comparable\r\nlevel of progress across the board.\r\nMr. Fraser (Canada) (interpretation from French):\r\nThis is the first Convention negotiated since Rio, and it\r\nreflects the spirit and commitment of the international\r\ncommunity to protect the environment through the\r\npromotion of sustainable development.\r\nAs we stated at the signing ceremony for the\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification, in Paris on 14\r\nOctober, Canada is proud to have taken an active part in\r\nthe creation of an instrument that will permit concerted\r\nworld action to attack the problem of desertification and to\r\nfind solutions that are preventative, corrective and lasting.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nCanada is particularly happy that it has been\r\nrecognized that the fight against desertification must\r\nintegrate socio-economic and cultural realities within the\r\nenvironmental context. Priority must be given to the\r\nreinforcement of human and institutional capacities of the\r\naffected developing countries and of their populations so\r\nthat these people will be able to become masters of their\r\nown development.\r\nFor the Convention to bear fruit, it is crucial that\r\naffected countries assume leadership. Donor countries will\r\ncontribute resources and technical assistance in support of\r\nthese efforts.\r\nAs a measure of Canadian concern, the Canadian\r\nInternational Development Agency will commit $4\r\nmillion for urgent assistance to Africa, as well as\r\nprogramming $100 million for anti-desertification\r\nprogrammes in Africa over the next five years. Ongoing\r\nprojects in other regions will also contribute to efforts to\r\ncombat desertification.\r\nI am sure that my delegation would want me to say\r\na special word of thanks to Ambassador Bo Kjellén and\r\nothers, who worked so hard to bring about this\r\nConvention.\r\nMr. Ould Ely (Mauritania) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The delegation of Mauritania associates itself\r\nfully with the clear and eloquent statement made by\r\nMr. Ramtane Lamamra, the Ambassador of Algeria, on\r\nbehalf of the States members of the Group of 77 and on\r\nbehalf of China. My statement today will therefore echo\r\nthe position expressed on the content and implementation\r\nof the United Nations Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa.\r\nThe fact that the General Assembly decided to hold\r\nthis debate in plenary meetings under the presidency of\r\nMr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire is in itself a happy\r\ncoincidence. In fact, it was in Abidjan, the economic\r\ncapital of Côte d’Ivoire, that the idea of drafting a\r\nconvention to combat the dual phenomenon of drought\r\nand desertification was launched in November 1991 by\r\nAfrica’s Ministers for planning and the environment.\r\nThis important initiative reflected the legitimate need\r\nto recognize that what is at stake is the survival of many\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, and to engage\r\nmore effectively and more comprehensively in the\r\nstruggle against the harmful and insidious effects of these\r\ntwo scourges. The same initiative became the foundation\r\non which the Earth Summit built the process of\r\nnegotiation to secure a strong and operational convention.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the unanimous adoption of\r\nthe Convention and its annexes — in particular those that\r\nrefer to Africa, which, quite appropriately, fill a legal gap\r\nin the sphere of the eradication of desertification and the\r\nmitigation of the effects of drought.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nThis undertaking could not have succeeded without the\r\nwell-known foresight and dynamism of Ambassador Bo\r\nKjellén, who chaired the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee, and Ambassador Arba Diallo, the Executive\r\nSecretary, both of whom gave a decisive impetus to the\r\nnegotiations. Once again we express our gratitude to them.\r\nThe other architects of success have undoubtedly been\r\nthe authorities of France, who having backed this initiative\r\nfrom the outset, provided outstanding facilities for the last\r\nsession of the Negotiating Committee. The most recent\r\nexample was the organization, last weekend in Paris, of an\r\nimpressive ceremony for the signing of the Convention.\r\nWe therefore express our warmest thanks to France.\r\nIndeed, the signing of the Convention by a very large\r\nnumber of Heads of Government and plenipotentiary\r\nministers is undoubtedly the eloquent expression of a\r\npolitically significant measure of great import. It is\r\npolitically significant because it reflects a growing\r\nawareness of the worldwide scale of the problem and\r\nindicates a common interest in finding lasting solutions to\r\nthese phenomena. This awareness stems from the complex\r\nimpact of the phenomenon of desertification, which, in the\r\nevent of failure to find remedies for its causes and its\r\neffects, may well give rise to serious gaps in the ecological\r\nbalance of our planet.\r\nDesertification is a global phenomenon with\r\nworldwide social, economic and environmental effects. It\r\nis a phenomenon whose full force is felt in Africa in\r\nparticular, and it is accompanied by structural food\r\nshortages, endemic famine and rural depopulation, as well\r\nas by a worsening food situation and the incurring of\r\nexternal debt.\r\nFaced with a steady drop in their per capita revenue,\r\nconstantly worsening terms of trade, a constant reduction in\r\ntheir sources of foreign finance, and Draconian regulations\r\ngoverning access to markets for their products, the countries\r\naffected by this tragedy place a great deal of hope in the\r\neffective implementation of the financial and technical\r\ncommitments contained in the Convention, as well as in the\r\ninterim preferential measures.\r\nWe continue to stress that this is a global phenomenon\r\nand that the spread of desertification cannot be reduced to\r\nthe simple dimension of urgency; its remedies cannot be\r\nlimited to simple humanitarian operations, however\r\nnecessary these may be. Because we have ignored this\r\nbasic truth and hidden the true nature of the problem of\r\ndesertification, the shortcomings of the solutions that have\r\nso far been advocated, through the 1977 Plan of Action,\r\nhave been vividly revealed.\r\nThe advance of the desert irreparably eats up several\r\nmillion hectares of fertile land every year and requires the\r\ndrafting and implementation in the medium and long\r\nterms of a global strategy focusing on control of the main\r\ncauses of desertification. These measures are so urgent\r\nthat we must ensure the rapid implementation of the\r\nConvention, which is an excellent framework for this\r\nprocess. In fact, the exceptional seriousness of the\r\neconomic situation in the countries affected by these\r\nphenomena, especially those in Africa, calls for political\r\nwill — and we are certain it will be manifested in the\r\nnear future.\r\nThere can be no doubt that desertification and\r\ndrought directly affect more than one fifth of the\r\npopulation of the Earth. Procrastination in the honouring\r\nof commitments will make it impossible to control the\r\ntragic effects of these phenomena. That is why, today,\r\nwe have a historical duty to mankind to do everything\r\npossible to ensure the successful implementation of this\r\nConvention and, thereby, make it an instrument capable\r\nof generating greater wealth and prosperity.\r\nMr. Sreenivasan (India): I am happy to speak\r\ntoday, when we have, to some extent, achieved one of the\r\nobjectives that we had set for ourselves at Rio. Along\r\nwith the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and the drawing up of the Programme of\r\nAction on Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States, the successful conclusion of\r\nnegotiations on the elaboration of a Convention to\r\nCombat Desertification in Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification is a matter of satisfaction.\r\nIndia was among the countries that signed the\r\nConvention in Paris last week. India has also been one\r\nof the Vice-Chairmen of the Bureau that has assisted the\r\nprocess of intergovernmental negotiations and has actively\r\nparticipated in its deliberations as well as in the\r\npreparation of the regional annex for Asia. We wish to\r\nplace on record our appreciation for Ambassador Bo\r\nKjellén of Sweden, whose painstaking efforts have\r\nbrought these negotiations to fruition.\r\nThe urgency and moral imperative for tackling the\r\nproblem of desertification and drought lies in the fact that\r\nit affects some of the poorest people in the world.\r\nCountries in which the vast majority of the people live off\r\nthe land, finding both sustenance and employment in\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nfarming and agriculture, face catastrophic consequences\r\nwith the loss of soil fertility, lack of rainfall and\r\ndiminishing groundwater levels. Desperate bids to increase\r\nfood production by clearing forests for farms and using\r\nchemical fertilizers ironically results in a vicious circle,\r\nperpetrating exactly that which is sought to be prevented.\r\nPoverty increases in extent and intensity. Growing\r\npopulations and the inability to handle environmental\r\nproblems are the consequences, not the causes, of\r\nunderdevelopment and environmental degradation.\r\nThe world today is without a doubt alive to\r\nenvironmental issues as never before. In every country, in\r\nevery remote village as well as in large and growing cities,\r\nthere is palpable concern about the spectre of environmental\r\ndisaster. But this concern seems to be expressed in ways\r\nthat are diametrically opposite, depending on economic\r\nsituations. The rich and well-off talk about ozone\r\ndepletion, global warming and nuclear hazards, all the while\r\ninducing some of these through their unsustainable\r\nproduction and consumption patterns. The poor man, on\r\nthe other hand, understands only that his crops wither in the\r\nbarren lands; his wife knows that she walks up to a dozen\r\nkilometres daily to collect a few potfuls of water; and their\r\nchildren know, with harsh inevitability, that they will go to\r\nbed hungry once again.\r\nScientists and experts tell us that many of these\r\nproblems are related to climate change, shifting monsoon\r\npatterns, falling groundwater levels and even, indirectly, to\r\nozone-layer depletion, because of its ill-effects on\r\nvegetation. But how do we explain all this to the victims\r\nof famine and drought? How do we convince the toiling\r\nfarmer of the linkages between his land’s becoming more\r\ninfertile day by day and the larger environmental issues?\r\nHow do we give a human face to environment?\r\nThe most satisfying feature of the Convention we are\r\nsigning today is that it reflects a basic concern of the\r\ndeveloping world and directly seeks to tackle real human\r\nproblems. It was no doubt contemplated largely in the\r\ncontext of Africa, a continent blessed with some of the\r\nrichest natural resources on the planet but also hit by some\r\nof the harshest blows of nature. However, what is true of\r\nAfrica is also true of the other regions of the world. The\r\nConvention also correctly distinguishes between deserts and\r\nlands prone to desertification and drought. Both conditions\r\nneed immediate attention; specific situations need specific\r\nsolutions. The regional annexes adopted along with the\r\nConvention bear testimony to the soundness of this\r\napproach and to its coverage of all the regions of the world.\r\nIndia is a vast and varied country; indeed, it is a\r\nsubcontinent in itself. From its lofty mountain peaks to\r\nits thousands of kilometres of coastline, almost every\r\nnatural condition known to humankind can be\r\nencountered. It has deserts of sand and deserts of snow,\r\nbut most disquieting is that 120 million hectares — nearly\r\n40 per cent of our land area — are threatened with\r\ndesertification in one way or the other. We have, over\r\nthe years, initiated a variety of programmes to deal with\r\nthese problems, to help conserve water and soil, to plant\r\ntrees and preserve forests. Our afforestation effort alone\r\nis of the order of 2 million hectares annually. We have\r\nmet with considerable success in our efforts, but these\r\nhave been limited by the financial resources at our\r\ncommand.\r\nLike everything else that resulted from Rio,\r\nincluding Agenda 21, adequate financial and appropriate\r\ntechnological resources need to be made available if the\r\nimplementation of this Convention is to become a reality.\r\nThe Global Environmental Facility includes in its mandate\r\nland-degradation issues, but this is only a very small\r\nbeginning. The Facility cannot be expected to adequately\r\nmeet the requirements of every pressing environmental\r\nneed. The question of a well-defined and more specific\r\nfinancial mechanism must be quickly and constructively\r\nresolved. Questions of war and peace seem to have\r\ngripped the attention of donor countries to the exclusion\r\nof official development assistance. The irony of it all is\r\nthat, since Rio, this assistance has actually declined in\r\npercentage as well as in real terms. We have to realize\r\nthat environmental degradation is as much of a threat to\r\nthe planet and to civil society as is war, and we will have\r\nto combat it with as much vigour.\r\nFinancial resources, important as they are, will not\r\nalone solve the problem. This complicated matter of\r\nhalting and reversing desertification requires a significant\r\ninput of appropriate technology. We have talked about\r\nthe necessity of technology transfer for many years now\r\nand even committed ourselves to do so in the Rio\r\nagreements, but a consensus on how this is to be achieved\r\nhas eluded us. On our part, we in India are eager to\r\nshare our technological expertise with our African\r\nbrothers and sisters and to cooperate with them and other\r\nfellow developing countries in the fight against the\r\nmarching sands. But unless the more advanced\r\ntechnologies of the developed countries are made\r\navailable and accessible, at affordable rates and on\r\nacceptable terms, to developing countries on all\r\ncontinents, the problem of desertification will continue to\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nremain intractable, threatening the very existence of our\r\nplanet.\r\nIf global environmental issues are not to remain in the\r\nrealm of the abstract, then there must be no more parched\r\nthroats, no more needless threats to infant life, no more\r\ndaily assaults on human dignity with the battering rams of\r\nhunger, unemployment and disease. Circumstances and\r\nsituations that are life-denying must be moulded into those\r\nthat are life-giving. Rio and the events that followed gave\r\nour planet one more chance. We must be careful lest we\r\nsquander this opportunity.\r\nMr. Rowe (Australia): Combating desertification has\r\nbeen the subject of international efforts for many years, but\r\nthese efforts have not met with the success hoped of them.\r\nNow, there has been a significant step forward. On 14 and\r\n15 October, many countries signalled their commitment to\r\ncarry forward efforts to combat desertification by signing\r\nthe United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification\r\nin Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, particularly in Africa. Australia was among\r\nthose countries which signed the Convention in Paris.\r\nAustralia wishes to pay tribute to the Chairman of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee, Ambassador\r\nKjellén, for his outstanding work and contribution, and to\r\nthe other members of the Bureau and to the Secretariat of\r\nthe Committee in bringing about the outcome the\r\nConvention represents.\r\nA great deal is at stake in this Convention. One sixth\r\nof the world’s population and one quarter of the total land\r\narea of the world are affected by desertification. These facts\r\nand figures identify something far more important: the\r\nhuman misery and poverty associated with desertification.\r\nMany nations have taken steps, through the intelligent use\r\nof water and reafforestation, to reclaim deserts.Australia has\r\ntaken an active part in the negotiations as an international\r\ncitizen determined to contribute to improving the global\r\nenvironment and the well-being of so many affected people,\r\nespecially in Africa.\r\nDesertification is also an important domestic issue for\r\nAustralia, as it is for several other temperate countries in\r\nthe southern hemisphere. Some 70 per cent of the\r\nAustralian continent is arid or semi-arid, receiving less than\r\n500 millimetres of rainfall annually. Despite this, land- and\r\nresource-based industries play a vital role in Australia’s\r\neconomy. Agriculture is the largest user of land in\r\nAustralia. While there have been significant increases in\r\nproductivity over the last 40 years, there have been serious\r\ncosts in land degradation. This has necessitated a change\r\nin approach to land management.\r\nThe Australian Government sees the management of\r\nland degradation as important to the long-term viability of\r\nAustralia’s land- and resource-based industries and the\r\nprotection of our environment. In 1990 the Federal and\r\nState Governments of Australia agreed to develop a\r\nnational decade of land-care plan. The aim of this plan is\r\nto achieve ecologically sustainable development through\r\nthe implementation of a cooperative partnership between\r\nGovernments at all levels, the community and individuals\r\nto address land degradation.\r\nCommunity action is important in encouraging the\r\nadoption of changed practices. At the local level, land-\r\ncare groups have been established to identify and respond\r\nto land-management problems.\r\nThe success of what we call the land-care movement\r\nis reflected in the participation rate — there are now\r\naround 2,200 land-care groups Australia-wide,\r\nrepresenting some 30 per cent of landholders. The number\r\ncontinues to grow despite four years of drought and\r\neconomic and social hardship in our rural communities.\r\nThese land-care groups in Australia look at practical\r\nmeasures for dealing with desertification and land\r\ndegradation, such as taking unsuitable land out of\r\nagriculture; minimal tillage; reafforestation; contour and\r\nrotational cultivation and cropping; the use of the key-line\r\nwatering system; and the growth of trees suitable for\r\nfodder supplementation in semi-arid and drought-prone\r\nregions. In these many ways our land-care groups add to\r\nan increasing knowledge which can assist Australia to\r\nmaintain its productive assets and increase the natural\r\nenvironment.\r\nAustralia wishes to extend its own research and\r\nknowledge and to share this experience with the\r\ninternational community. Article 10 of the Convention,\r\nsetting out the elements of national action programmes to\r\ncombat desertification, is based largely on an Australian\r\nproposal which was in turn based on Australia’s\r\nexperience with land care, and reflects our willingness to\r\nshare that experience with other people and other nations\r\nwith similar problems.\r\nThe international community’s approach to the\r\nConvention has shown urgency and maturity. We have\r\nlearned valuable lessons from past attempts to address\r\ndesertification. It is no accident that the Convention\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nconcentrates on the socio-economic causes of\r\ndesertification; and not just the symptoms. The emphasis in\r\nthe Convention is on integrating “top-down” and “bottom-\r\nup” approaches so that Governments and communities can\r\nwork together.\r\nThis partnership extends to other areas of the\r\nConvention. Countries have agreed to work together to\r\ntarget and utilize more effectively existing funding for\r\ndesertification programmes; to integrate and coordinate the\r\ncollection, analysis and exchange of information relevant to\r\ndesertification; and to promote technical and scientific\r\ncooperation.\r\nBut much remains to be done. We must ensure that\r\nthe provisions of the Convention are converted into\r\neffective and practical action. The first step is the urgent\r\naction package for Africa. The Australian Government\r\nalready supports various programmes in Africa addressing\r\naspects of desertification and drought mitigation. Examples\r\nof these programmes include: reafforestation in Tanzania;\r\nrural water supplies in Mozambique; a land-information\r\nstrategic plan for Namibia; rural rehabilitation in Eritrea;\r\nand agricultural training in South Africa through the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).\r\nThe Australian Treasurer, the Honourable Ralph\r\nWillis, announced in Paris last week a special contribution\r\nby the Australian Government as part of the urgent action\r\nfor Africa programme, including a contribution of up to\r\n$A250,000 over several years for the provision of\r\nAustralian constancy services in combating desertification.\r\nThis money will be available to African States for technical\r\nassistance and advice in setting up their national action\r\nprogrammes. Australia also plans to undertake, through its\r\nBureau of Meteorology, a joint feasibility study with the\r\nWorld Meteorological Organization for the establishment of\r\na network linking the two drought-monitoring centres in\r\nNairobi and Harare with the African Centre of\r\nMeteorological Application for Development, in Niamey.\r\nAustralia is investigating means of initiating a research\r\nprogramme on the ecological problems facing arid and\r\nsemi-arid regions. The aim is to produce a set of principles\r\nto guide the development of national action programmes for\r\nspecific countries. We hope that these programmes will\r\ncontribute to the launching and success of the urgent action\r\nfor Africa programme.\r\nWays of dealing with the scarcity of water are a\r\nfundamental part of sustainable land management. A major\r\nfocus must be on the proper use of water. Its wastage\r\nshould be condemned and the encouragement of its\r\nproductive usage must be a priority. In Australia we are\r\nonly now — at a time when we are experiencing possibly\r\nthe worst drought in Australia’s history — coming fully\r\nto appreciate that water is not a cheap renewable\r\nresource.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to emphasize again the\r\nimportance of community participation in the battle\r\nagainst desertification. The Australian experience has\r\nshown that individual land holders, community groups\r\nand non-governmental organizations must play a crucial\r\nrole in the implementation of the Convention;\r\nGovernment cannot do it alone. It has to be a joint and\r\ncontinuing contribution.\r\nWe urge the international community to work\r\nenergetically. Cooperating together we can ensure that this\r\nConvention achieves its objectives for affected people\r\naround the world.\r\nMr. Hønningstad (Norway): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of Norway and the other Nordic\r\ncountries — Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden.\r\nThe ceremony in Paris a week ago for the signing of\r\nthe international Convention to Combat Desertification in\r\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa, represents a\r\nsignificant step in the follow-up of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED).\r\nWith its integration of environment and development, this\r\nimportant document epitomizes the basic concept of the\r\nRio Conference — sustainable development. We pay\r\ntribute to the Bureau of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee under the chairmanship of Ambassador Bo\r\nKjellén, and to the Committee’s secretariat for their\r\nefforts and valuable contributions to the negotiating\r\nprocess.\r\nThe Convention provides a framework for affected\r\ncountries and peoples, as well as for relevant\r\norganizations and donors, to address the serious problems\r\ncaused by land degradation and the increasing imbalances\r\nbetween people and available resources. It will contribute\r\nto safeguarding the global environment. In addition to its\r\nsignificance for economic and social development, it will\r\nalso reduce the risk of conflict that may arise from\r\ndrought and lack of water. Not least important is the\r\nemphasis on urgent action for Africa through the special\r\nresolution to this effect adopted at the same time as the\r\nConvention.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nLike the Rio process itself, the Convention will\r\nultimately be judged by its implementation. This endeavour\r\nmust be carried forward on the international, regional,\r\nnational and local levels. It requires the involvement of all\r\nstrata of society.\r\nThe Nordic countries will actively participate in the\r\nimplementation effort. This includes reviewing development\r\ncooperation in areas such as poverty alleviation, land\r\ndegradation and fresh water in the light of the Convention’s\r\nprovisions. It will thereby be possible to further develop\r\nrelevant programmes in land management as well as in institution-\r\nand capacity-building.\r\nThe Convention has thus far been signed by close to\r\n90 parties. It is now open for signature here at the United\r\nNations in New York. The Nordic countries would like to\r\necho the statement of the Secretary-General in this respect;\r\nwe urge the countries that have not already done so to sign\r\nand ratify the Convention in order to ensure its entering\r\ninto force as soon as possible. In the meantime, satisfactory\r\narrangements for the interim period must be decided upon\r\nby the General Assembly, in accordance with the agreement\r\nreached in Paris in June and in the light of the report\r\n(A/49/477) of the Secretary-General under this agenda item.\r\nThe ceremony in Paris a week ago symbolized the end\r\nof a long negotiating effort. It should also signify the start\r\nof a decisive and purposeful endeavour to transform the\r\nparagraphs of the Convention into concrete action. We must\r\nuse the next session of the Negotiating Committee in\r\nJanuary and the session of the Commission for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in April to give impetus to this effort.\r\nMr. Eliashiv (Israel): The successful conclusion and\r\nadoption of the Convention to combat desertification,\r\nsigned recently in Paris by a large number of States,\r\nincluding Israel, is indeed recognition by the international\r\ncommunity that human beings in affected or threatened\r\nareas are at the centre of concerns to combat desertification\r\nand mitigate the adverse effects of drought.\r\nThis is yet another important achievement of the\r\ninternational community in the follow-up to the Rio\r\nConference, as part of our commitment to build on the\r\nmomentum of international cooperation on the environment\r\nand sustainable development. We must now translate the\r\nwords of the Convention into deeds and implement a\r\nprogramme of action. We welcome the coordinated\r\nactivities aimed at supporting the effective implementation\r\nof the Convention and the urgent measures for Africa. In\r\nthis respect, United Nations organizations and agencies\r\nactive in the fields of combating desertification and of\r\ndevelopment can play an important role by expanding and\r\nintensifying their support.\r\nOur appreciation goes to Ambassador Kjellén and\r\nAmbassador Diallo for their efforts and contribution.\r\nDesertification, a phenomenon of global dimensions,\r\naffects the lives and well-being of 2.7 billion people. All\r\nof us who are concerned about the environment must\r\nredouble our efforts to eradicate desertification. No\r\ncountry is exempt from this effort and each one, large or\r\nsmall, rich or poor, must contribute to facing the\r\nchallenge to the extent of its capabilities.\r\nIsrael has a firm commitment to combating\r\ndesertification. We can avoid each other’s errors and\r\nemulate each other’s successes. Nothing is more urgent\r\nthan a programme of environmental information,\r\ncompilation, dissemination and monitoring under\r\ninternational auspices. Nearly every problem has a\r\npossible technological or scientific solution, provided\r\nthere is a desire to solve it and to make the financial\r\nmeans available. Solutions are viable only if they are\r\nconceived and put into effect on a global scale.\r\nIsrael is especially sensitive to the fragility of the\r\nenvironment and development because our country’s\r\nrebirth is a continuous ecological drama of rehabilitating\r\nscarred, eroded, denuded landscape, of redeeming fertile\r\nvalleys degraded into buzzing malarial swamps and of\r\nreversing the rapacity and neglect which had created the\r\ndesert.\r\nMan’s endeavours to settle the desert and his\r\nattempts to extract a livelihood out of the barren land are\r\nas ancient as man himself. The Prophet Isaiah gave\r\nexpression to these endeavours when he said\r\n“The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad;\r\nand the desert shall rejoice and blossom like the\r\ntulip.” (Isaiah 35:1)\r\nThe central gift of Israel’s experience to the hope of\r\nenvironmental improvement lies in the Negev adventure.\r\nBelieving that the desert is man’s creation and not the\r\ninexorable decree of nature or history, we have launched\r\na campaign against aridity, with results that are being\r\nshared with other nations of the world.\r\nOur research is adapted to the particular\r\nrequirements of our area, and is linked to the very\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nextensive developments in Israel in the use of water\r\nresources and in processes of desalination of sea water and\r\nbrackish water in the desert. All of this research and\r\ndevelopment, which includes the highest degree of water\r\ncontrol in the world, is directed towards turning arid deserts\r\ninto green, fruitful, food-bearing soil.\r\nThe National Desert Research Institute at Ben Gurion\r\nUniversity in Israel is engaged in research and development\r\non arid zones and, in particular, on the conversion of the\r\ndesert into a productive environment. The scope of the\r\ninstitution’s activities transcends Israel’s borders, for much\r\nof the research has worldwide significance.\r\nIn fact, Israel has already initiated its activities under\r\nthe Convention by establishing a master plan for an\r\ninternational centre for combating desertification, to be\r\nlocated at Sede Boqer in the Negev Desert. This will\r\nactually be an extension and upgrading of the Blaustein\r\nInstitute for Desert Research, which, in addition to its\r\nnational responsibilities, will assume a regional and\r\ninternational role in the study of and training in desert\r\nresearch and desertification control.\r\nMs. Arystanbekova (Kazakhstan), Vice President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nIsrael is willing to share its rich experience and know-\r\nhow in combating desertification with neighbouring\r\ncountries, as well as with other countries in Asia, Africa\r\nand Latin America. We invite all countries to join us in the\r\nventure of desert research and share our experience in\r\nfinding solutions to desertification, in particular within the\r\nframework of the Convention’s action programmes for our\r\nregion in Asia.\r\nThe human factor is no less central to combating\r\ndesertification, in bringing about the effective involvement\r\nof the population and in implementing national policies.\r\nTherefore, increased attention will have to be directed to\r\nhuman resources, sustainable development and the transfer\r\nof training and technology. We have placed a great deal of\r\nemphasis on the development of human resources, which\r\nhas become the key to the country’s technological\r\nexpansion and a marked feature of its extensive technical\r\nand economic cooperation with other countries.\r\nThe importance of adequate funding mechanisms\r\ncannot be overemphasized. In this respect, we must\r\ncontinue to replenish and strengthen the capability of the\r\nGlobal Environment Facility to finance environmental\r\nprogrammes of the countries concerned. Non-governmental\r\nenvironmental organizations should be given our support\r\nfor their continuing activities as catalysts for\r\nenvironmental improvement. Within the framework of the\r\nactivities of the Commission on Sustainable Development,\r\nas part of the implementation of Agenda 21 and in\r\nsupport of the implementation of the concerted efforts to\r\ncombat desertification, we are planning to convene in\r\nIsrael in 1995 an international seminar on water\r\nmanagement, co-sponsored by Israel and Japan.\r\nFurthermore, in November 1994, an international\r\nworkshop on arid-land crops will take place in Israel at\r\nBen-Gurion University in the Negev.\r\nWhile general awareness and policies must be\r\noutlined on a global level, special importance should be\r\nattributed to regional cooperation in solving problems of\r\ncommon interest. The Middle East possesses vast desert\r\nlands, but meagre water resources. The desert can be\r\nturned into green, fertile land. The experience and\r\ntechnology are available. Water can be reused and new\r\nfresh water can be produced from the sea.\r\nThe historic landmark in the relationship between\r\nIsrael and the Palestinians, the peace treaty between Israel\r\nand Jordan that was initialled on Monday and will be\r\nsigned next week, the ongoing multilateral negotiations\r\nand the unprecedented conference that will convene in\r\nCasablanca later this month open new vistas for regional\r\ncooperation and partnership in devising ways and means\r\nto combat desertification and to advance economic and\r\nsocial development. We can work together to advance\r\nregional projects in arid-zone agricultural development,\r\nalternate sources of energy, and desalination technology.\r\nWe can cooperate to establish a regional network of\r\nresearch and monitoring centres for combating\r\ndesertification, thus promoting the welfare of all the\r\ninhabitants of our region.\r\nWe hope that peace will eventually embrace all\r\nneighbouring countries so that we can achieve a\r\ncomprehensive settlement in our region and dedicate our\r\nefforts and resources to sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Mongbe (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nOn 22 December 1992, when the General Assembly\r\nadopted, without a vote, resolution 47/188 on the\r\n“Establishment of an intergovernmental negotiating\r\ncommittee for the elaboration of an international\r\nconvention to combat desertification in those countries\r\nexperiencing serious drought and/or desertification,\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nparticularly in Africa”, many delegations were sceptical\r\nabout the Committee’s chances for success.\r\nAdmittedly, the Assembly was taking the international\r\ncommunity into difficult terrain; there were few studies or\r\nin-depth analytical documents to help the Committee and\r\nfacilitate the negotiations. This was a challenge that all\r\nStates had to take up in a joint effort. In spite of the\r\ndifficulties, the pitfalls, the pressure and the sleepless\r\nnights, the negotiators managed to carry out their task with\r\nunswerving determination. Following an organizational\r\nsession and five negotiating sessions that took the\r\nCommittee from New York to Paris, via Nairobi and\r\nGeneva, a Convention was concluded on 17 June 1994.\r\nToday, we can say with a feeling of satisfaction that\r\nthe international community has won the battle. But it has\r\nnot yet won the war to combat desertification and mitigate\r\nthe effects of drought in affected countries. The road ahead\r\nis long, very long. We must hone our weapons and spare\r\nno effort if we are to achieve our goal.\r\nThe conclusion, adoption and opening for signature of\r\nthe Convention will permit us to proceed to the more\r\ncomplex, slower-paced phases: ratification and entry into\r\nforce of the Convention and the effective implementation of\r\nits provisions. The negotiators have not lost sight of these\r\nissues, which could be obstacles that would slow us in our\r\nprogress towards the final objective.\r\nIn that connection, the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee, on 17 June 1994, adopted a resolution on\r\nurgent measures for Africa, calling on affected African\r\ncountries to take urgent action, including the preparation of\r\nregional and subregional action programmes. It also\r\nencourages developed countries and international and\r\nregional institutions to provide financial and other forms of\r\nsupport for African initiatives. The resolution recommends\r\nthat African countries and donors strengthen their\r\npartnership. It is important to stress that the resolution on\r\nurgent measures for Africa covers the period from the\r\nsigning of the Convention to its entry into force 90 days\r\nafter the Secretary-General has received the fiftieth\r\ninstrument of ratification.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank all the countries and\r\ninstitutions that pledged contributions during their\r\nstatements at the Convention’s signing ceremony at Paris\r\non 14 and 15 October. Those contributions will have a\r\nsignificant impact on the interim implementation of the\r\nConvention and will help us succeed in achieving the\r\nobjectives to be met before the first meeting of the\r\nConference of the Parties. I am convinced that States and\r\norganizations which have not yet stated their intentions\r\nwill do so in the near future, thus demonstrating their\r\nfirm commitment to the implementation of the resolution\r\nand the Convention.\r\nThis new international legal instrument is a concrete\r\nresult of the decisions and recommendations of the June\r\n1992 Rio summit; it is very different from previous\r\ninstruments. For the first time, an international convention\r\nhas integrated the ideas of environment and development;\r\nit has laid down principles that will underlie international\r\ncooperation in combating desertification and mitigating\r\nthe effects of drought. It has given us clear, precise\r\nguidelines on the measures we must take to attack those\r\ntwo scourges and coordinate national, subregional and/or\r\nregional programmes of action as well as the activities of\r\ncommunities and international and non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nI should also like to emphasize that the Convention\r\nhas four annexes for regional implementation, which\r\nallows activities to be adapted to the specific conditions\r\nof each region. The annex relating to Africa is the only\r\none of the four regional texts to set out specific\r\nobligations in the implementation of which the developed\r\ncountries parties to the Convention must give priority to\r\nAfrica, the continent most affected by desertification and\r\ndrought.\r\nWith regard to technical assistance, the African\r\nannex refers to the need to give preference to African\r\nexperts, whose services would be far less costly than\r\nthose of foreign consultants. In addition, in the body of\r\nthe Convention, as well as in the annexes, which are part\r\nand parcel of the Convention, the idea of partnership is\r\ngiven pride of place, as is coordination of scientific and\r\ntechnological cooperation.\r\nWe owe everything we have been able to achieve,\r\nincluding the insertion of new elements in the articles of\r\nthe Convention, to all the participants in the negotiation\r\nprocess, who showed determination, perseverance and\r\nresponsibility in arriving at this compromise text. We\r\ncannot fail to make special mention of the exceptional\r\nrole played by Ambassador Bo Kjellén of Sweden,\r\nChairman of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee, who at trying moments used his great\r\nintelligence and patience to restore hope to the various\r\nparticipants in the negotiations. I take personal pride in\r\nhaving worked and continuing to work on the Bureau\r\nwith that talented and experienced man. I would like to\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nadd to this friendly tribute my appreciation of my\r\ncolleagues on the Bureau, the officers of the Working\r\nGroups, the spokespersons of the regional groups and\r\ninterest groups, and all those whose discretion and\r\nselflessness helped cement together the stones used in\r\nbuilding the edifice of this Convention. I naturally express\r\nfraternal feelings to Ambassador Hama Arba Diallo,\r\nExecutive Secretary of the Committee, whose conviction,\r\ntenacity and personal commitment, with the support of a\r\nteam of men and women of great skill and dedication, made\r\nit possible to provide optimal conditions for the\r\nCommittee’s work. The Organization of African Unity,\r\nwith the encouragement of its Secretary-General and the\r\nsupport of the members of the joint secretariat and the ad\r\nhoc group of African experts on desertification, played an\r\ninvaluable role that enabled Africa to maintain the initiative\r\nand conduct fruitful negotiations with other regions of the\r\nworld.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not praise the role and\r\nactive participation of non-governmental organizations in\r\nthe elaboration of the Convention. Last week’s memorable\r\nceremony for the signing of the Convention, organized by\r\nFrance, confirmed, if there was ever any doubt, the support\r\nthe great country of France has always given to African\r\ndelegations since they submitted this initiative to the\r\nPreparatory Committee of the Rio Conference. We should\r\nlike to express here our deepest appreciation to France.\r\nThe time has come to turn our words into deeds. The\r\nConvention is an exemplary framework for action. It is our\r\nduty and obligation to act in order to put an end to the\r\nsuffering of the populations affected throughout the world,\r\nespecially those in Africa. In his statement at the ceremony\r\nfor the signing of the Convention, Ambassador Arba Diallo\r\nstated:\r\n“The political will that prevailed in the negotiations\r\nfor the Convention should also prevail in the various\r\nphases of its implementation. This is essential for its\r\nsuccess.”\r\nI would like to endorse that idea, and I call on all States to\r\ncontinue to be inspired by the spirit of Rio, which guides\r\nus along the path of the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): The elaboration of the\r\nInternational Convention to combat desertification has\r\nbrought to fruition the sustained efforts generated since the\r\nRio Earth Summit.\r\nI add my voice to the warm tributes paid to\r\nAmbassador Bo Kjellén for his successful charting of the\r\ncourse of negotiations conducted through five preparatory\r\nmeetings, held in three continents over two years, and for\r\ncoordinating a wide variety of positions.\r\nThe introductory statements of Mr. Ismat Kittani, on\r\nbehalf of the Secretary-General, and Ambassador Bo\r\nKjellén succinctly outlined where we stand today and the\r\ndirections for urgently following up the Convention, both\r\nin the short term and in its long-term orientation.\r\nThe Rio Earth Summit highlighted the crucial link\r\nbetween environment and development and propagated\r\nthe now widely accepted and recognized concept of\r\nsustainable development. Yet, in adopting the Convention\r\non Climate Change and the Convention on Biological\r\nDiversity, there was recognition that one specific issue\r\nwas left pending: the degradation of vast areas of the\r\nEarth’s surface because of drought and desertification. It\r\nis therefore a matter of great satisfaction that this void has\r\nnow been filled in.\r\nNo one can doubt the significance of the fact that 25\r\nper cent of the land surface of the earth is afflicted by the\r\nspread of drylands and creeping desertification. This has\r\naffected the lives and well-being of 900 million people.\r\nThe impact of this phenomenon has been most severe in\r\nAfrica. Bangladesh has fully supported the need, in\r\ntaking remedial steps, to accord particular priority to\r\naffected African countries.\r\nWe believe it is important, however, that attention\r\nalso be devoted to vast areas that are potentially\r\nvulnerable to and threatened by the desertification\r\nprocess. Desertification, as we all know, is caused by a\r\ncomplex interaction between physical, political, social,\r\ncultural and economic factors. It is therefore vitally\r\nnecessary to anticipate and adopt a forward-looking\r\napproach. A host of preventive actions should constitute\r\nthe core of any effective strategy, since prevention and\r\nreduction of land degradation is more economical than\r\nreclamation of desertified land. Another integral element\r\nof an overall strategy would be combating drought, since\r\nprolonged drought can cause serious land degradation\r\nleading to desertification.\r\nI am happy to announce that Bangladesh signed the\r\ninternational Convention to combat desertification in Paris\r\nlast week. As is well known, Bangladesh is one of the\r\nmost densely populated countries in the world. Given the\r\npoor land-man ratio and the urgent need for enhanced\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nfood production, there is a growing concern that prolonged\r\ndrought, inadequate rainfall, a drastic fall in the ground-\r\nwater table, and the consequent change in soil properties\r\nand the soil degradation in recent years, especially in the\r\ndry season, will have a sustained and cumulative adverse\r\nimpact on our economy and living standards. There are\r\nalready appreciable indications of semi-aridity in the north-\r\nwestern region of the country. The situation is further\r\naggravated by decreased water flows in some major river\r\nsystems, particularly during the dry season. The\r\nmanagement of water resources in the eastern Himalayan\r\nregion falls far short of meeting the ecological needs of the\r\nregion.\r\nVarious provisions of the Convention constitute a\r\nuseful basis for effectively combating drought and\r\ndesertification. Recognition of the need to integrate\r\nstrategies for eradicating poverty into efforts to combat\r\ndesertification and mitigate the effects of drought is vital.\r\nWe sincerely expect that under the obligations enjoined by\r\nthe Convention developed countries parties to the\r\nConvention would actively support the efforts of affected\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly those in Africa, and the\r\nleast developed countries in dealing with the problem.\r\nBangladesh attaches particular importance to the\r\nimplementation of preventive measures for lands that are\r\nnot yet degraded or which are only slightly degraded, and\r\nthe international community should complement such\r\nmeasures. We feel that such measures may include, inter\r\nalia, the establishment of early-warning systems, the\r\nstrengthening of drought preparedness and management and\r\nfood security systems. The cooperation of the international\r\ncommunity, particularly in the framework of subregional\r\naction programmes, is crucial in this regard. Such\r\ncooperation should include, among others, joint programmes\r\nfor the sustainable management of transboundary natural\r\nresources. We also appreciate the spirit of partnership\r\nwhich prevailed throughout the negotiations and the bottom-\r\nup approach involving local participation. The role of the\r\nnon-governmental organizations can be a critical element\r\nfor the effective implementation and follow-up of the\r\nConvention.\r\nWe welcome the simultaneous adoption of the three\r\nregional annexes, which form an integral part of the\r\nConvention. They provide concrete guidelines for a\r\nfocused approach on regional specificities. As for the\r\nregional implementation annex for Asia, the broad diversity\r\nranging from areas already affected to areas vulnerable to\r\ndesertification and drought has been duly recognized.\r\nProvisions for subregional joint action programmes have\r\nbroadened the scope for coordination and meaningful\r\ncooperation in various fields.\r\nIt is particularly important that partial data or lack of\r\nprecise data should not be an excuse for inaction, whether\r\nby decision-makers and by the global community at large.\r\nDelay would be terribly costly as some forms of\r\nenvironmental damage may be irreversible. We hope that\r\nthe dangers of an impending environmental crisis may be\r\ninstrumental in forging closer cooperation in research,\r\nexchange of information, transfer of technology and\r\ntechnical know-how. We also look forward to an\r\nequitable sharing of resources among countries rich and\r\npoor, with a view to saving our planet and ensuring the\r\nbetterment of the lives of future generations.\r\nThis brings us to the critical issue of the means of\r\nimplementation of the various measures envisaged in the\r\nConvention. The United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme has estimated that it would take between $10\r\nbillion and $22.4 billion a year for 20 years to prevent\r\nfurther land degradation and to undertake numerous land\r\nconservation projects. In this context, the question of\r\nnew and additional resources is of crucial importance.\r\nBangladesh fully supports the idea of the global\r\nmechanism and hopes that the global mechanism as\r\nenvisaged in the Convention will be successful in\r\npromoting actions leading to the mobilization and\r\nchannelling of substantial financial resources, including\r\nthe transfer of technology, on a grant basis or on\r\nconcessional terms to affected and threatened developing\r\ncountries. The Global Environment Facility, with limited\r\nresources to implement Agenda 21 and the Conventions\r\non climate change and biodiversity, is now overburdened\r\nas Governments are urged to promote the mobilization of\r\nadequate, timely and predictable financial resources,\r\nincluding new and additional funding from the Global\r\nEnvironment Facility.\r\nThe problem of desertification has assumed global\r\nproportions with contingent economic, social and political\r\nconnotations. We believe there is a moral obligation on\r\nthe part of the comity of nations to help those millions\r\nwhose lives are directly affected by this problem. As we\r\nmove towards combating desertification, the global\r\ncommunity should put equal emphasis on arresting land\r\ndegradation, especially in densely populated countries.\r\nBilateral and multilateral financial mechanisms and\r\narrangements must take into full consideration the special\r\nsituation and needs of the least developed countries as\r\nthey are striving hard to overcome the menace of\r\ndesertification and to arrest the threat of land degradation.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nThe urgency of taking any remedial action cannot be\r\noveremphasized.\r\nMr. Azwai (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): Allow me at the outset to express thanks on\r\nbehalf of my delegation to all those who have contributed\r\ndirectly or indirectly to the elaboration of the International\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries\r\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\r\nparticularly in Africa, which was signed in Paris last week.\r\nThis Convention is the first international mechanism\r\nto combat desertification. We attach great hopes to this\r\ninstrument for the preservation of the planet and for\r\nensuring future development on it for present and future\r\ngenerations.\r\nIt is a fact that desertification and drought are among\r\nthe most important problems threatening environmental\r\nbalance with the resultant threat to human life in many\r\nparts of the world. The African continent is the region\r\nmost affected by drought and desertification. It is\r\ngratifying that this has become an international concern.\r\nThe need to combat this grave problem is widely\r\nrecognized. The Convention to combat desertification was\r\nelaborated as a follow-up to the United Nations Conference\r\non Environment and Development. It is our hope that it\r\nwill enjoy the political and financial support needed for the\r\nachievement of the objectives that previous efforts failed to\r\nachieve because of limited resources.\r\nMy country attaches the greatest importance to\r\nquestions of environment and development, as it is exposed\r\nto the encroachment of the sands from the south, sea\r\npollution in the north, the scarcity of water resources and\r\nrainfall fluctuations, and periods of drought which last,\r\nsometimes for three to five years. All these phenomena are\r\nrendered more acute because of the scarcity of underground\r\nwater which is not sufficient for irrigating arable land.\r\nRecognizing the importance of the grave threats posed\r\nby these phenomena to the natural resources we depend\r\nupon for food production, my country has cooperated with\r\nthe countries members of the Arab Maghreb Union in\r\nelaborating a Maghreb strategy to combat desertification, in\r\nthe setting-up of the Maghreb green dam project and in\r\nestablishing an African network for monitoring and\r\nexchange of information in the areas of desertification and\r\nsoil erosion.\r\nAt the national level, my country has taken several\r\nsteps, particularly the following: First, the setting-up of\r\nadministrative structures mandated to implement the\r\npolicy of combating desertification, preserving and\r\ndeveloping natural soil and water resources, in addition to\r\nexpanding afforestation programmes and the development\r\nand improvement of pasture land. Second, the enactment\r\nof laws for the protection of agricultural land and natural\r\nresources such as the Land Use Act, the Water Act, the\r\nForestry Act and other laws which aim at the preservation\r\nand development of the sustainable use of natural\r\nresources.\r\nMany studies and researches have been carried out\r\nin the areas of surveying natural resources, categorizing\r\ntypes of soil and determining their possible uses under\r\nvarious conditions as well as developing water resources.\r\nOn the basis of those studies, many dams have been built\r\nto preserve rain water and replenish underground water\r\nreservoirs with a view to expanding the arable area.\r\nAlso, dams have been built in the valleys to stop soil\r\nerosion.\r\nMillions of saplings were planted in areas that were\r\nthreatened with desertification. Windbreaks have been\r\nplanted to protect agricultural lands and tens of thousands\r\nof moving sand dunes have been stabilized with the use\r\nof oil products and by planting trees. The studies have\r\nproved the feasibility of transporting water from the\r\ndesert areas to the coastal areas in the north with their\r\nrelatively temperate climate, population density and arable\r\nland. This has led to the great man-made river project\r\nwhich aims at supplying nearly 6 million cubic metres of\r\nwater daily for the irrigation of additional areas of\r\nagricultural land.\r\nThis would protect those areas from desertification\r\nand reinforce Libya’s efforts to protect the environment.\r\nThe Prime Minister of Malaysia rightly paid tribute\r\nto this action in his statement before the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-sixth session when he stated that:\r\n“Libya should be congratulated on tapping\r\nunderground water to irrigate its desert.” (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Forty-sixth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 7th meeting, p. 91)\r\nMy country has spared no effort over the past 25\r\nyears in combating such severe natural phenomena as\r\ndrought, lack of rain and limited water resources.\r\nExpenditure on the agricultural sector has reached over\r\n$15 billion, in addition to expenditure on the great man-\r\nmade river which would cost, when completed, more than\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\n$30 billion. The first stage has been completed. The second\r\nstage is still under way.\r\nHowever, all these efforts are being hampered by two\r\nfactors. The first factor is the danger of the mines which\r\nwere planted in Libya’s territory during the Second World\r\nWar. These mines prevent the reclamation of large tracts\r\nof arable land along the coastal area. At various sessions\r\nof the General Assembly, my country has called upon the\r\ncountries concerned to cooperate with us in demining those\r\nfields and to pay compensation to our people for the\r\ndamage inflicted upon them.\r\nThe second factor is the unjust embargo imposed on\r\nmy country by Security Council resolutions. The embargo\r\nhas slowed down and, at times, paralyzed our research\r\nprogrammes, including those dealing with combatting\r\ndesertification and other environmental phenomena.\r\nWith the necessary political will to provide financial\r\nsupport for the implementation of the Convention, we will\r\nachieve great results in combatting desertification and\r\ndrought. Without such support, it will suffer the same fate\r\nas other international instruments in that field. We count\r\non the cooperation and exchange of experiences on the\r\ninternational and regional levels.\r\nMr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nFrance wishes to endorse the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Germany on behalf of the European Union\r\nand, in particular, to associate itself with the tribute that he\r\npaid to Ambassador Kjellén and to the secretariat of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee for their tireless\r\nefforts to conclude an international convention to combat\r\ndesertification within the established time frame.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, France wished to show the\r\nparticular interest it has in this Convention by proposing\r\nthat the last negotiating session and the signing ceremony\r\nbe held in its capital. This ceremony, which took place at\r\nthe headquarters of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization on 14 and 15 October,\r\nbrought together representatives from 114 States and 24\r\nUnited Nations agencies. On that occasion, 85 States and\r\none organization for regional economic cooperation signed\r\nthe new Convention. This success exceeded the\r\nexpectations of the organizers and should facilitate the\r\nratification and implementation of the new instrument.\r\nWith the Paris Convention we now have a pragmatic\r\ninstrument which reflects our real determination to adapt\r\nourselves to the terrain and specific characteristics of each\r\nof the regional situations.\r\nThe Convention is one of solidarity. It defines the\r\nframework for true partnership in accordance with which,\r\nfirst of all, the countries affected by desertification should\r\nundertake an updating of their national plans of action\r\nand, at the national level, mobilize all those involved in\r\nthe implementation of the broad guidelines of the\r\nConvention.\r\nMoreover, donors will have the possibility to\r\nimprove the coordination of their efforts and to act as true\r\npartners with the countries affected.\r\nWe welcome the fact that this text provides for\r\nurgent measures for Africa because this continent, though\r\nnot the only one affected, is the one hardest hit by\r\ndesertification.\r\nFrance will make implementation of the Convention\r\none of its priorities in the matter of cooperation\r\nparticularly in the countries of the Sahel.\r\nIt will be attentive to local initiatives and will\r\nsupport the implementation of national plans of action. It\r\nwill support projects to mobilize populations to manage\r\ntheir own natural resources, in particular their water\r\nresources, and France is committed to reducing the effects\r\nof desertification on the nomadic peoples which are\r\nparticularly affected.\r\nFinally, in 1995 France will launch a new\r\nprogramme relating to renewable sources of energy in\r\nAfrica. The objective of this programme will be to\r\nreduce the impact of domestic energy consumption on\r\nforest resources.\r\nFor all of these actions to combat desertification, my\r\ncountry currently earmarks F 1 billion per year. To that\r\nshould be added our contribution to the World\r\nEnvironment Fund, which could help in the financing of\r\nefforts to combat desertification in view of its impact on\r\nthe global environment.\r\nFrance hopes that this action will be based on\r\nregional solidarity, in particular through the Permanent\r\nInterstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel.\r\nMy country will contribute to the funds to assist the nine\r\ncountries in that region and will mobilize additional\r\nresources to enable the Committee to assist the States of\r\nthe Sahel in setting up their national plans.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nMoreover, my country, whose research teams have\r\ngained knowledge and know-how in the matter of\r\ndesertification, will, of course, be involved in the work of\r\nthe Sahara and Sahel Observatory. The President of the\r\nRepublic of France himself hailed the creation of this\r\nObservatory in 1989.\r\nFinally, in 1997, the next surveillance satellite spot\r\nwill be specially equipped with a new instrument that will\r\nfacilitate the follow-up, on a continent-wide scale, of the\r\nphenomenon of desertification and regrowth of vegetation.\r\nWe need to act urgently and as I have said, my\r\ncountry intends to do all it can to ensure the success of the\r\nConvention. I am certain that in this struggle we will all be\r\nworking in partnership.\r\nMr. Koshroo (Islamic Republic of Iran): I would like\r\nto begin by expressing my gratitude to the Chairman, the\r\nExecutive Director and the secretariat of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the\r\nElaboration of an International Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification (INCD) for their tireless\r\nefforts during the negotiations on the Convention on\r\nCombating Desertification.\r\nThe conclusion of the Convention is one of the\r\npositive developments towards sustainable development\r\nwhich the international community has been able to achieve\r\nsince the Rio Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment. The Islamic Republic of Iran, which has\r\nsigned the Convention, wholeheartedly welcomes its\r\nconclusion and calls for its expeditious ratification by all\r\ncountries in order to boost collective efforts to combat\r\ndesertification. We should not lose time. Advantage should\r\nbe taken of the interim period before the entry into force of\r\nthe Convention to work out national and international\r\nprogrammes of action especially the mobilization of\r\nfinancial resources. In this respect, the scheduled session of\r\nthe Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee in January\r\n1995 is significant.\r\nDesertification and drought are problems of global\r\ndimension, affecting almost all regions and threatening the\r\nlives and prosperity of more than 900 million people. As\r\nnoted in Agenda 21, desertification and drought affects one\r\nsixth of the world’s population and one quarter of the total\r\nland area of the world. A problem of such magnitude\r\ncannot be dealt with single-handedly. It can only be dealt\r\nwith at the national level. There is need for concerted\r\ninternational cooperation to combat desertification in all\r\nits aspects.\r\nThe implementation of the Convention depends to a\r\ngreat extent on the provision of substantial new and\r\nadditional financial resources. The United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme has estimated that between $10\r\nbillion and $22.4 billion would be required annually for\r\nan effective 20-year global programme. This would\r\ninclude the cost of rehabilitating land already degraded\r\nand of preventing the further loss of fertility. As decided\r\nduring the negotiations, the Global Environment Facility\r\nwill serve also as the financing source for the Convention.\r\nAt present, after a new replenishment of the Facility, only\r\n$2 billion for a three-year period is pledged. This amount\r\nfalls far short of the requirements of Agenda 21 itself.\r\nTherefore, unless new commitments are made, the Facility\r\nwill be unable to meet the financial requirements of the\r\nprogrammes of action envisaged by the Convention.\r\nI should like to discuss briefly the problem of\r\ndesertification in Iran and the activities undertaken by the\r\nGovernment so far. About 80 percent of Iran’s total land\r\narea has an arid or semi-arid climate and is thus\r\nvulnerable to desertification. Deserts account for 34\r\nmillion hectares of Iran’s total land area, with an average\r\nannual rainfall of 50 millimetres.\r\nThe causes of desertification are not all natural. Such\r\nfactors as population growth, over-grazing and\r\nunsustainable use of rangeland, the use of wood and\r\nplants for fuel and the uncoordinated exploitation of water\r\nresources have contributed to land degradation and\r\ndesertification.\r\nTo address this threatening trend, the Government\r\nhas allocated large amounts of resources to desertification\r\ncontrol activities. At the same time, specific measures are\r\nbeing undertaken to increase public awareness, to\r\ndecrease migration to urban areas through socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of rural ones, to protect the environment and\r\nrestore the ecological conditions of degraded lands, to\r\nstabilize sand dunes and to encourage public participation.\r\nRecently a national committee was established to\r\ncoordinate all the activities aimed at combating\r\ndesertification. The Committee is currently involved in\r\nformulating a national programme of action for\r\ndesertification control.\r\nTaking into account the pivotal role of multilateral\r\ncooperation in this crusade, the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nhas also focused on bilateral and multilateral cooperation\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nwith interested countries and relevant international and\r\nregional organizations. Following negotiations with the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific\r\nand the United Nations Environmental Programme, a\r\nDesertification Control Programme Office has been set up\r\nto prepare national projects, train experts and carry out\r\nresearch and studies on desertification.\r\nIn conclusion, while reiterating my country’s\r\ncommitment to international cooperation in combating\r\ndesertification and drought, we call on the international\r\ncommunity — in particular, the developed countries — to\r\nstand by their own commitments as elaborated in the\r\nConvention.\r\nMr. Maycock (Barbados): I have the honour to\r\naddress the Assembly on behalf of the 12 States of the\r\nCaribbean Community that are members of the United\r\nNations, namely, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas,\r\nBelize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, and my own country, Barbados, on\r\nagenda item 89 (d), “Elaboration of an international\r\nconvention to combat desertification in those countries\r\nexperiencing serious drought and/or desertification,\r\nparticularly in Africa”.\r\nThe States members of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) fully associate themselves with the statement\r\nmade by the Chairman of the Group of 77 on this issue.\r\nWe wish also to pay tribute to the effective leadership of\r\nAmbassador Bo Kjellén of Sweden, Chairman of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee, and his Bureau,\r\nas well as the competent support provided by the Executive\r\nSecretary, Mr. Hama Arba Diallo, throughout the\r\nnegotiating process.\r\nThat process, set in train by a specific decision taken\r\nat Rio de Janeiro and by the mandate given in General\r\nAssembly resolution 47/188, has culminated in the adoption\r\nof an International Convention to Combat Desertification in\r\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa. Last weekend, in\r\nParis, 87 countries signed the Convention. Given its critical\r\nimportance to the countries affected, we support the call for\r\nprompt action to ensure its early entry into force.\r\nWhile the Convention that has been adopted did not\r\nmeet all of our expectations, we nevertheless believe that it\r\nrepresents an important advance in the international\r\ncommunity’s efforts to address a major problem that carries\r\nwith it serious adverse consequences both for the\r\nenvironment and for development.\r\nIn our view, the Convention is a balanced document\r\nthat recognizes the complex dimensions of the problem of\r\ndesertification as involving not only physical and\r\nbiological factors but also those of a political, social,\r\ncultural or economic character, and that advocates\r\nintegrated response strategies based on community\r\nparticipation and partnership at the local, national,\r\nregional and international levels.\r\nImportant recognition is given to the effects of\r\ndesertification and drought on the sustainable\r\ndevelopment efforts of affected developing countries and\r\non the interrelationship of these effects with the issues of\r\npoverty, population, health and nutrition, food security\r\nand migration. Similar attention is paid to the effect of\r\ninternational economic and trade conditions on the ability\r\nof affected countries to combat desertification adequately.\r\nThe triangular approach and the focus on the elaboration\r\nof action programmes through the widest possible\r\nconsultation, participation, and coordination are important\r\nfeatures of the Convention, which we commend.\r\nThe clear emphasis given to the catastrophic\r\ndimensions of the problem of desertification in Africa in\r\nboth the Convention and the relevant regional\r\nimplementation annex are, in our view, completely\r\njustified, and we fully support the content of the\r\nCommittee’s resolution on urgent action for Africa. At the\r\nsame time we are heartened by the recognition given to\r\nthe global nature of the problem through the conclusion\r\nof implementation annexes for other affected regions,\r\nwhich take into account their particular conditions.\r\nDesertification and drought are of serious concern to\r\nseveral of the countries of Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean, and we welcome the specific provisions of the\r\nimplementation annex for our wider region.\r\nDesertification is a global phenomenon from which\r\nno country can consider itself immune. It affects 25\r\npercent of the world’s lands and 900 million of its people.\r\nWhile we in the Caribbean have been spared the ravages\r\nof desertification in its extreme form, we have of late\r\nbecome increasingly exposed to the effects of persistent\r\ndrought, which has this year caused severe damage to the\r\nagricultural sector and adversely affected the water supply\r\nof many of our countries. Climate change and climate\r\nvariability, which perhaps share a causal link with\r\ndesertification, may have been contributing factors.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nThe preventive and remedial experiences of others in\r\nour region and beyond, particularly in the area of land,\r\nwater and crop management, are therefore of considerable\r\ninterest to us, and in this regard we welcome the emphasis\r\nplaced on strengthening the functioning of the global\r\nnetwork of institutions and facilities for the collection,\r\nanalysis and exchange of data and information.\r\nIt is the hope of the CARICOM member States that\r\nthe seriousness with which the international community\r\napplied itself to the task of elaborating the Convention will\r\nbe matched by a clear demonstration of the necessary\r\npolitical will in the implementation stage. For, like Agenda\r\n21 itself and the other Conventions and processes to which\r\nit gave rise, the desertification Convention will be critically\r\ndependent for its successful implementation on the\r\nprovision by the international community of adequate\r\nfinancial resources, access to relevant technologies, and\r\nappropriate measures for capacity-building. In this regard,\r\nwe look forward to the elaboration by the Conference of\r\nthe Parties of the modalities to govern the global\r\nmechanism established by the Convention.\r\nThe States members of CARICOM have taken careful\r\nnote of the report presented by the Secretary-General in\r\ndocument A/49/477, which gives a clear picture of the\r\nconsiderable preparatory work, both procedural and\r\nsubstantive, that must be undertaken pending the entry into\r\nforce of the Convention and the convening of the first\r\nConference of the Parties. Many important initiatives can be\r\nset in train during the interim period to ensure the early and\r\neffective operation of the Convention once it enters into\r\nforce. We are confident that the General Assembly will take\r\nthe necessary action at this session to enable the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee and the interim\r\nsecretariat to carry out their tasks towards this end.\r\nMr. Erdenechuluun (Mongolia): At the outset, I\r\nwish to express my delegation’s sincere gratitude to\r\nAmbassador Bo Kjellén of Sweden, Chairman of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee, for his\r\noutstanding contribution to the elaboration of the\r\nInternational Convention to Combat Desertification. We\r\nowe our gratitude also to Mr. Hama Arba Diallo, Executive\r\nSecretary of the Negotiating Committee, and his staff for\r\ntheir excellent work, which was instrumental in the timely\r\nadoption, on 18 June 1994, of the Convention.\r\nWe believe that this Convention is a valuable addition\r\nto the Rio environmental treaties — the Conventions on\r\nclimate change and biodiversity — and represents a solid\r\nbasis for our future activities. What is required now is an\r\nadequate response on the part of all actors, at both the\r\nnational and the international levels, to implement the\r\nprovisions of this Convention. Taken together, these\r\ninternational instruments will help solve the world’s major\r\nenvironmental problems.\r\nMongolia welcomes the adoption of the Convention\r\nand its signature by a large number of States and is\r\nlooking forward to its prompt entry into force and its\r\nsubsequent effective implementation. Mongolia was one\r\nof the first to sign the Convention in Paris. We believe\r\nthat the Convention is an important means of promoting\r\ninternational cooperation, harmonizing national, regional\r\nand international efforts, and mobilizing resources for\r\ntackling one of the most serious environmental problems\r\nfacing the world today.\r\nMongolia is particularly pleased that the Convention\r\naddresses the underlying causes of desertification,\r\nincluding human behaviour and environmental and socio-\r\neconomic factors. The Convention’s great significance lies\r\nin the fact that it is based on the premise of the\r\ninterdependence of environmental and development\r\nproblems. Desertification represents a major barrier to\r\nsustainable food security and threatens the livelihood of\r\nmany millions of people around the world; hence the\r\nimperative need for international cooperation to confront\r\nthis challenge resolutely.\r\nMy delegation considers it important that the\r\nmomentum created by the adoption of the Convention be\r\nsustained. It is in this context that I wish to commend the\r\nspecific ideas and proposals made in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/49/477) in regard to future\r\narrangements for the work during the interim period\r\nleading to the first meeting of the Conference of the\r\nParties to the Convention. A considerable amount of\r\npreparatory work will have to be carried out if that\r\nConference is to be successful. A great deal will no doubt\r\ndepend also on actions at the national, subregional and\r\nregional levels. Here, one cannot overemphasize the\r\nimportance of a new approach reflected in the\r\nConvention, which focuses, inter alia, on a “bottom-up”\r\nphilosophy involving the participation of local populations\r\nand non-governmental organizations in the preparation\r\nand implementation of action programmes, as well as on\r\nthe concept of partnership agreements bringing together\r\naffected countries, the developed and other countries, and\r\ninternational organizations in the attainment of common\r\nobjectives.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nThe mobilization of adequate financial resources is a\r\nmost important prerequisite to the effective implementation\r\nof the Convention. In this regard, my delegation wishes to\r\ncommend the recent aid packages announced by the donor\r\ncommunity at a high-level meeting in Paris. However, we\r\ncannot fail to stress time and again the importance of new\r\nand additional resources.\r\nWe hope that the establishment by the Convention of\r\na global mechanism will help raise substantial financial\r\nresources, including those for the transfer of technology to\r\naffected developing countries. It has been recognized that\r\nthe land-degradation issues, primarily desertification and\r\ndeforestation, would be eligible for financing by the Global\r\nEnvironment Facility (GEF). Hence, it will be one of the\r\nmechanisms and sources of financing the implementation of\r\nthe Convention. The Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee and the GEF should, in our view, already start\r\ncooperative action during the interim period.\r\nDesertification, drought and deforestation are of major\r\nconcern to Mongolia as well. One third of our territory is\r\ndesert, as defined in the Convention. There is also a large\r\nportion of land which is highly vulnerable to desertification.\r\nThe edge of the southern arid region is moving northward\r\nat the rate of about 50 metres per year. Drought, which is\r\na frequently occurring phenomenon in our country, affects\r\nhalf of its entire territory and represents a great burden on\r\nour economy. Creeping desertification is having an\r\nincreasingly destabilizing effect on the country’s biological\r\ndiversity.\r\nIn order to address these problems adequately,\r\nMongolia adopted in 1992 a National Plan of Action to\r\nCombat Desertification. It was drawn up with an emphasis\r\non preventive policies and actions against desertification,\r\ntaking into account long-term and cost-saving benefits. To\r\nimplement this Plan of Action, a Gobi Desert Development\r\nCentre was set up to study the ecological situation of the\r\nGobi desert and the natural anthropogenetic factors of\r\nchange as well as control of ecological balance; formulate\r\npractical measures to combat desertification and organize\r\nresearch work for environmental monitoring in desert areas;\r\nand elaborate a strategy for the sustainable economic and\r\nsocial development of arid areas.\r\nIt goes without saying that, as in other developing\r\ncountries, practical implementation of these projects\r\nrequires national capacity-building coupled with scientific\r\nand technological cooperation with other countries and\r\ninternational organizations. Mongolia is looking forward to\r\nmeaningful deliberations on this important issue at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Abdellah (Tunisia) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The Tunisian delegation would like first to\r\nexpress its satisfaction at the adoption and signing by a\r\nlarge number of countries of the United Nations\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries\r\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\r\nParticularly in Africa.\r\nThe binding nature of this multilateral agreement is\r\na positive step in the implementation of commitments\r\nmade at the Rio Summit. We are therefore at a decisive\r\nturning-point in the efforts of the countries concerned and\r\nof the whole international community to find appropriate,\r\nlasting solutions to the scourge of desertification.\r\nWith the impending implementation of the\r\nConvention, the States parties, with the help of all the\r\norganizations concerned, have managed in a short time,\r\njust two years after Rio, to give themselves an instrument\r\nto combat this natural phenomenon, which is a\r\nconsiderable hindrance to development in a number of\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa.\r\nTunisia, whose borders are being eaten into by the\r\ndesert, is genuinely optimistic that the objectives of the\r\nConvention will be realized. An effective and dynamic\r\nworld partnership is capable of curbing desertification,\r\nwhich threatens ecological balance and nullifies\r\ndevelopment efforts.\r\nThe importance that the African continent attaches\r\nto the Convention’s implementation cannot be\r\noveremphasized. The continent’s interest in the matter\r\nwas expressed yet again at the most recent Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) Summit, held in Tunis in June\r\nthis year, when the African States committed themselves\r\nto setting up the structures needed to implement the\r\nConvention and the annex relating to Africa.\r\nOwing to the scale of the phenomenon of\r\ndesertification and its devastating effects, which impinge\r\non many areas, the African States realize that alone they\r\ndo not have the capacity to wage an effective struggle\r\nagainst it without help. The struggle to which we are\r\ncommitted calls for technical and financial inputs that the\r\naffected countries cannot provide on their own.\r\nTherefore, the Convention should be a means of\r\nmobilizing the potential of the countries concerned while\r\ntapping international financial and technical assistance\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\ncommensurate with the scale of the worldwide phenomenon\r\nof desertification and its threat to life on Earth.\r\nIn this regard, I am pleased to stress that Tunisia has\r\nalready taken extensive action to protect the environment\r\nthreatened by creeping desertification. The national strategy,\r\nwith several years’ experience behind it, has been bolstered\r\nby the recommendations of the Rio Summit. The tool for\r\nmanaging this strategy, called “Main Jaune”, is based on\r\nintegrated development through close cooperation between\r\nvarious ministerial departments and effective participation\r\nby local communities and populations that are affected.\r\nTunisia, which has considerable experience and\r\nexpertise in this area, can contribute by putting that\r\nexperience and expertise at the disposal of brother African\r\ncountries. This brotherly cooperation can be an effective\r\nmeans of pushing back the advance of desertification, a\r\nscourge which endangers natural wealth and life in several\r\nregions of our continent.\r\nAs it assumes the chairmanship of OAU, Tunisia\r\nwould like to remind the international community and the\r\nrelevant international, regional and non-governmental\r\norganizations of the seriousness of problems connected with\r\ndrought and desertification and of the need for perseverance\r\nin solving them. The assistance that the African continent\r\nurgently needs requires us all — donor countries in\r\nparticular — to give the question of desertification the\r\nimportance it merits as a worldwide environmental problem\r\nwith serious implications for development.\r\nAs the problem far exceeds the potential of the\r\ncountries affected, the Republic of Tunisia has taken the\r\ninitiative, through its President, Mr. Zine El Abidine Ben\r\nAli, of proposing a series of practical mechanisms for\r\ninternational cooperation based on the necessary North-\r\nSouth solidarity. They include recycling debt into projects\r\nto protect the environment and ensure sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nTunisia’s interest in the question of desertification is\r\nencouraged by the success of the work of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the\r\nelaboration of the Convention. Here I should like to pay\r\ntribute to Mr. Bo Kjellén, who chaired the Committee, and\r\nMr. Arba Diallo, the Executive Secretary, who, through\r\ntheir perseverance and their combined efforts, contributed\r\nto the success of the negotiations between the various\r\nparties.\r\nMr. Karukubiro Kamunanwire (Uganda): My\r\ndelegation is grateful for the opportunity to participate in\r\nthe debate on the United Nations Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa.\r\nThis Convention is a vital link in the elaboration of\r\nlegally binding instruments to save our globe.\r\nI should like also to express our sincere gratitude to\r\nthe Chairman of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee for the Committee’s report (A/49/84 and\r\nAdd.1 and 2). We also wish to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his related report (A/49/477).\r\nIn 1908 Winston Churchill described my country,\r\nUganda, as “the pearl of Africa”, as a land that was\r\n“from end to end one beautiful garden, where the\r\nstaple food of the people grows almost without\r\nlabour.”\r\nThe country at that time knew no drought, no famine and,\r\nindeed, no poverty. The livelihood of our people was\r\nsustainable. Today drought, famine and poverty have\r\nbecome an endemic problem. Food security can no longer\r\nbe taken for granted. Poverty has contributed to\r\nunsustainable agricultural practices and environmentally\r\nharmful use of our forest resources, which, in turn, have\r\nled to drought and desertification.\r\nThis situation typifies a phenomenon that is taking\r\nplace worldwide. According to available statistics, the\r\ndegradation of dry lands threatens the livelihood and food\r\nsecurity of more than 900 million people in over 100\r\ncountries. The process of desertification now affects one\r\nquarter of the global population. In Africa, over 70 per\r\ncent of agricultural dry lands are already degraded, while\r\nmore than 60 per cent of the land is already desert or dry\r\nland. These sad trends will certainly spur the loss of\r\nbiological diversity, cause climatic change, trigger\r\nmigrations and add to an already overburdened\r\ninternational community unquantifiable demand in\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nAccording to the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme, approximately $1 billion is spent annually on\r\ndesertification programmes. The threshold level for\r\nfunding an effective anti-desertification campaign is\r\nestimated at between $10 billion and $22.4 billion per\r\nannum for the next 20 years. Meanwhile, desertification\r\nis estimated to cost $42 billion in agricultural income\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nannually. Against this background, the case for new and\r\nadditional funding is compelling and must be recognized.\r\nUganda welcomed the General Assembly’s timely\r\nestablishment, in resolution 47/188, of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee. A long and\r\narduous negotiating process followed. Uganda participated\r\nactively in that process, which culminated in the conclusion\r\nof the Convention in Paris on 18 June this year.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the priority accorded to\r\nAfrica in the Convention. In that regard, we were\r\nparticularly encouraged by the resolution adopted by the\r\nNegotiating Committee on urgent action for Africa for the\r\ninterim period. By that resolution, the international\r\ncommunity committed itself to providing tangible support\r\nto Africa during the interim period. Regrettably, the\r\nresponse from the international community at the signing\r\nceremony in Paris, on 14 and 15 October, was lukewarm.\r\nI wish to make a special appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to respond favourably to the commitments\r\nundertaken in Paris in support of Africa, especially with\r\nregard to the provision of financing, technology and other\r\nresources needed for the effective implementation of the\r\nConvention.\r\nUganda, for its part, concluded a Natural Environment\r\nAction Plan that provides a national policy framework to\r\naddress environmental concerns. We also undertook a case\r\nstudy in the area of desertification. We are now finalizing\r\nthe preparation of specific project profiles drawn from\r\npriority areas in the case study. The project profiles clearly\r\ndefine our own contribution towards their implementation\r\nas well as the additional resources needed from donors and\r\nthe international community to support our endeavours. As\r\nregards the signing of the Convention, the necessary\r\nlegislative procedures have been completed, and we will\r\nsign the Convention shortly here in New York.\r\nWe remain committed to the efforts of the Inter-\r\nGovernmental Authority on Drought and Development\r\n(IGADD) to address the problem of desertification in our\r\nsubregion and have participated actively in various IGADD\r\nconsultations to elaborate subregional projects on\r\ndesertification. We appeal to the international community\r\nto support our subregional and regional efforts.\r\nFor the interim period, it is necessary that effective\r\nmeasures be put into place in preparation for the entry into\r\nforce of the Convention. The interim secretariat should be\r\nfacilitated in undertaking transitional activities until the\r\npermanent secretariat of the Convention is designated by\r\nthe Conference of the Parties. Equally, other critical\r\ninstitutional and substantive issues such as financing\r\nmechanisms and the terms of reference of the Committee\r\non Science and Technology should be agreed upon at the\r\nfirst meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the\r\nConvention. For these to be realized, it is necessary that\r\nadequate human and financial resources be mobilized to\r\nsupport the interim arrangements. We therefore wish to\r\necho the Secretary-General’s appeal for such support.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that desertification is\r\na global problem that requires global solutions. For us to\r\nsucceed, the international community must marshal the\r\npolitical will and resolve to address this problem.\r\nMr. Ayewah (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation\r\nwould like to contribute to the debate on agenda item\r\n89 (d), “Elaboration of an international convention to\r\ncombat desertification in those countries experiencing\r\nserious drought and/or desertification, particularly in\r\nAfrica”, and to express our appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/49/477) dated 5 October 1994.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to associate itself with the\r\nstatement made on the subject by the representative of\r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nIn paying tribute to the Government of France for\r\nhosting the fifth and final session of the Negotiating\r\nCommittee and for providing facilities for the initial\r\nsigning ceremony of the Convention, which took place in\r\nParis last week, we wish to underscore the continuing\r\nrelevance of international efforts to combat the ravages of\r\nthe natural phenomena of desertification and drought. We\r\nthank Ambassador Bo Kjellén of Sweden, Chairman of\r\nthe Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee, the\r\nmembers of the Bureau and the United Nations Secretariat\r\nfor their diligence and hard work throughout the\r\nnegotiation process.\r\nThe most significant accomplishment of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee on the\r\ndesertification process, therefore, is the international\r\nattention that has been mobilized around this problem.\r\nThe negotiation of the Convention has been a success in\r\nlinking those affected by desertification with donors,\r\nUnited Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations\r\nand non-governmental organizations. The negotiation\r\nprocess of the Convention undoubtedly laid the\r\nfoundation for future global partnership arrangements to\r\ncombat desertification.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 21 October 1994\r\nLet me also say that the journey of the Convention on\r\nDesertification started in June 1992 in the city of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, Brazil, during the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED) and following the\r\nadoption of Agenda 21 by the international community.\r\nNigeria welcomes the conclusion of the International\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification and looks forward to\r\nits entry into force. We have taken note of the fact that the\r\nConvention addresses major environmental problems and\r\nprovides a framework that departs largely from the past\r\ninadequate arrangements made by the international\r\ncommunity to address the problem. However, our preferred\r\noption would have been the institutionalization of the spirit\r\nof Rio by having a fifth window, for Desertification, in the\r\nGlobal Environmental Facility, in order to ensure\r\npredictability, transparency and coordination of funds at all\r\nlevels.\r\nIn this regard, we recall that it was the lack of\r\nfinancial support by the international community that led\r\nto the failure of the Nairobi Plan of Action to combat\r\ndesertification, which was adopted in 1977.\r\nMany countries in Africa, including Nigeria, are\r\nseriously affected by desertification and drought. Most of\r\nthese countries fall within the category of least developed\r\ncountries, which have inadequate resources to confront the\r\nenvironmental hardships occasioned by these scourges.\r\nThere is therefore an urgent need to check the vicious\r\ncycle of poverty attendant on land degradation.\r\nIt is against this background that we call on the\r\ninternational community to provide the necessary\r\nadditional financial resources and technological assistance\r\nto complement national efforts in order to combat\r\ndesertification and drought, preserve the ecosystem and\r\nprevent further environmental degradation, particularly in\r\nAfrica.\r\nIn conclusion, Nigeria hopes that the Convention\r\nwill enjoy universal support so that it can justify the\r\npurpose of its adoption and be a complement to the\r\nConventions on climate change and biodiversity.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
