(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Seniloli (Fiji),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 89 (continued)\r\nEnvironment and sustainable development\r\n(d) Elaboration of an international convention to\r\ncombat desertification in those countries\r\nexperiencing serious drought and/or desertification,\r\nparticularly in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/49/477)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreports of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee (A/49/84 and Add.1 and Add.2)\r\nDraft resolution (A/49/L.4)\r\nMr. Talpur (Pakistan): At Rio de Janeiro, with the\r\nadoption of Agenda 21, we launched a historic process\r\nwhich led to the finalization of the convention to Combat\r\nDesertification in those Countries Experiencing Drought\r\nand/or Desertification. The culmination of this process at\r\nthe Paris signing ceremony is a recognition, not only of the\r\nfact that the international community is fully conscious of\r\nthe ravages caused by drought and desertification, but also\r\nof its commitment to deal with this problem.\r\nThis is no longer a problem affecting a few countries\r\nwhich are left to cope with it on their own, but one of\r\nglobal dimensions. The international community, through\r\nthis Convention, has undertaken the responsibility of\r\ndealing with the issue in a collective manner within an\r\noperational framework that calls for strengthened\r\npartnerships. The Convention is the first international and\r\nlegally binding instrument deriving from the Rio\r\nConference that links environment and development.\r\nIn countries affected by desertification and drought,\r\nthe twin menace has grave socio-economic consequences.\r\nIt affects every aspect of human activity. The Convention\r\ntherefore recognizes that “desertification and drought\r\naffect sustainable development through their\r\ninterrelationships with important social problems such as\r\npoverty, poor health and nutrition, lack of food security,\r\nand those arising from migration, displacement of persons\r\nand demographic dynamics”.\r\nThe problem of desertification and the effects of\r\ndrought affect an estimated 900 million people in over 80\r\ncountries. Within these countries, those touched are\r\namong the poorest and the most marginalized. These\r\nproblems stunt economic growth and development and\r\nhave in some cases led to the impoverishment of many a\r\ndeveloping country.\r\nPoverty has grave socio-economic implications and\r\nis destroying the present world order. Societies have\r\nbegun to disintegrate as people compete for increasingly\r\nscarce resources. This scarcity of resources, especially of\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nfood stocks in the developing countries, has led to internal\r\nstrife. Every year, one or two countries descend into\r\ninternal political chaos because they can no longer provide\r\nsustenance and hope for their peoples. The spreading chaos\r\ncan no longer be quarantined behind barbed wire to protect\r\nthe islands of the privileged. The affluent countries are\r\nunable to insulate themselves. Failure to deal with\r\ndesertification and the effects of drought accelerates the\r\nprocess of impoverishment of the people in dry lands and\r\nexacerbates the emergency cycle of famine and drought\r\nrelief, thereby diverting resources badly needed for\r\naddressing long-term issues of development. The adoption\r\nof the Convention provides the international community\r\nwith the tools it needs to deal with the issues of poverty\r\nand food scarcity, which are multiplied in countries\r\nafflicted with drought and desertification.\r\nI have the honour to inform this Assembly that\r\nPakistan signed the Convention at the Paris ceremony. The\r\neconomy of Pakistan has an agricultural base and we are\r\nincreasingly concerned at the rapid loss of good cultivable\r\nland to the expanding deserts. The loss of such land has\r\nbrought immense misery to the small landowners and\r\ntillers. Families have been uprooted in the provinces of\r\nSindh, Baluchistan, the North West Frontier and Punjab as\r\nland erosion sets in. In search of a livelihood, such farm-\r\nbased families are forced to migrate to larger cities. To stop\r\nsuch human suffering is of critical importance to the\r\nGovernment of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Every inch\r\nof agricultural land is precious to us and therefore our\r\ncommitment to the Convention rises out of our own\r\nimmediate concerns as do our efforts to work together with\r\nthe international community to deal with this environmental\r\nproblem, which directly affects the lives of millions of\r\nhuman beings.\r\nThe Convention and its annexes form a legally binding\r\ninstrument. Signing it is therefore a declaration of intent on\r\nthe part of all signatories that the obligations identified in\r\nthe document are binding upon them.\r\nThe adoption of the Convention also reflects a tacit\r\nagreement that the African countries afflicted by these two\r\nproblems require immediate attention. We stand by our\r\nbrethren from Africa and sincerely hope that the\r\nimplementation of the Convention will assist them in their\r\nefforts to alleviate some of their economic problems, which\r\nare the direct result of these twin problems.\r\nThe actions taken by the developing countries at the\r\nnational level to implement the Convention not only require\r\npolitical commitment but also substantial new and\r\nadditional resources. The increased resources are critical\r\nfor developing countries to reclaim the land swallowed by\r\ndeserts. According to estimates, nearly $22 billion will be\r\nrequired annually over the next 20 years to finance the\r\nrehabilitation of land and halt the decline in fertility. Such\r\nadditional resources would be difficult to generate in the\r\nalready financially strapped developing countries.\r\nIt is quite clear that adequate technology and know-\r\nhow are critical for land reclamation. Such technology is\r\navailable in the developed countries that have decades of\r\nexperience with such problems. It is therefore essential\r\nthat the developed countries step in with adequate new\r\nfinancial resources. Such resources should be made\r\navailable to the signatories of the Convention that have\r\nreflected their commitment to dealing with this issue\r\nthrough national action but are unable to implement their\r\nprogrammes in this area due to a lack of resources.\r\nIn Pakistan we have attempted to undertake some\r\nremedial measures through reforestation projects and the\r\nconstruction of tube-wells. Within the context of our\r\nnational conservation strategy, and linking it with the\r\nsocial action programme vigorously pursued by the\r\npresent Government, we have launched land-reclamation\r\nprojects and projects to support displaced and\r\nimpoverished families. The problem is large and the\r\nresources of the Government limited. We look forward to\r\nany additional resources that can strengthen our hand in\r\ncarrying out our efforts to combat the onslaught of\r\ndesertification and land erosion.\r\nWe are convinced that the United Nations Sudano-\r\nSahelian Office of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme can play an extremely important role in\r\nassisting the developing countries in the implementation\r\nof the Convention. That Office can provide advice to\r\ndeveloping countries on acquiring the required expertise.\r\nWe welcome the decision of the Administrator that\r\nfollowing the adoption of the Convention the Office will\r\nnow deal with the needs of all countries facing the\r\nproblems of drought and desertification.\r\nThe arduous journey of drafting a legal document is\r\nover. We are now stepping into its implementation phase.\r\nIn order to ensure that the Convention does not become\r\njust another well-bound document in the archives,\r\npolitical commitment at the highest level is essential.\r\nImplementation will require concrete national action with\r\nappropriate international support.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nMr. Maruyama (Japan): Last week in Paris, at the\r\nceremony hosted by the Government of France, my\r\nGovernment, together with those of many other States,\r\nsigned the United Nations Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa. The\r\nConvention is an important achievement, and the number of\r\nsignatories augurs well for its prompt entry into force.\r\nI should like to express my sincere appreciation to the\r\nGovernment of France for hosting this magnificent\r\nceremony. I also extend my appreciation to Mr. Bo Kjellén,\r\nChairman of the Negotiating Committee, for carrying out\r\nhis most difficult responsibilities with such consummate\r\nskill. I wish also to thank Mr. Arba Diallo, Executive\r\nSecretary of the Negotiating Committee, and all the others\r\nwho worked so hard to complete the Convention. We must\r\nnow bend our efforts to securing its prompt ratification and\r\nto finishing the work necessary to ensure its full\r\nimplementation. In the light of the momentum we have\r\ngenerated, I am convinced that we can overcome any\r\ndifficulties that may arise at the next session of the\r\nNegotiating Committee early next year, and I assure the\r\nAssembly of the full cooperation of my Government\r\ntowards that end.\r\nAs the Convention explicitly states, desertification is\r\ninterwoven with a variety of economic and social issues,\r\nand a comprehensive approach is therefore needed if the\r\nproblem is to be successfully addressed. The Tokyo\r\nDeclaration, adopted at the conclusion of the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development (TICAD)\r\nheld in Japan, also emphasizes the importance of taking\r\nmeasures to assist Africa and enhance its self-reliance. My\r\nGovernment sincerely hopes that TICAD follow-up\r\nactivities will dovetail with efforts to implement the\r\nConvention and thereby accelerate progress towards the\r\nsustainable development of Africa. For its part, Japan has\r\nsteadily increased its development assistance to Africa in a\r\nwide range of areas. For example, it has worked to increase\r\nfood supplies and food production, to improve health care\r\nand sanitation, to build capacity and to promote human\r\nresources development. It has increased the cooperation it\r\nhas provided to the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the African Development Bank and\r\nthe World Bank, particularly in connection with their efforts\r\nto assist sub-Saharan African countries. And it has\r\nannounced a plan to increase official development\r\nassistance for environmental projects to the level of 900\r\nbillion to 1 trillion Japanese yen — that is, $7 billion to\r\n$7.7 billion — over the five-year period from 1992 through\r\n1996, and for projects related to population and HIV/AIDS\r\nto $3 billion for the period 1993 to 2000, assistance that\r\nwill go to developing countries in Africa and elsewhere.\r\nOne programme of assistance particularly relevant in\r\nthe context of the Convention is the African Programme\r\nfor the Supply of Potable Water, which provides grant aid\r\nfor the development of groundwater and water-supply\r\nsystems. Approximately $250 million to $300 million in\r\nsuch aid has been allocated to it for fiscal years 1993\r\nthrough 1995. Used in combination with development\r\nstudies, the grants are aimed at achieving the following\r\nthree objectives: first, ensuring access to potable water;\r\nsecondly, developing groundwater systems to improve\r\npeople’s living environments; and, thirdly, relieving\r\nwomen and children of the hard daily labour of drawing\r\nand carrying well water. Approximately $98 million in\r\ngrant aid was disbursed in fiscal year 1993 to fund 17\r\nprojects in 15 African countries.\r\nI should like to make a few comments with respect\r\nto the measures that we intend to take in order to assist\r\nthe implementation of the Convention, particularly in the\r\ncontext of the “prompt start” process.\r\nFirst, Japan will strengthen the dialogue it conducts\r\nwith those countries affected by desertification and\r\ndrought on whether the projects carried out with Japanese\r\nofficial development assistance are actually helping to\r\ncombat desertification. Secondly, we shall dispatch survey\r\nmissions to countries severely affected by desertification\r\nor drought, particularly in Africa, to further clarify needs\r\nin the field. Thirdly, we will be actively involved in\r\ndeveloping a coordinating mechanism to assist in the\r\nformulation of a programme of action to combat\r\ndesertification in the most affected countries.\r\nThe signing of the Convention is an important\r\nachievement, but, as I noted at the outset, we must now\r\nmove on to realize the goals it envisages. It is my hope\r\nthat our efforts will meet with success.\r\nMs. Yang Yanyi (China) (interpretation from\r\nChina): I make this statement on behalf of the Deputy\r\nPermanent Representative of the People’s Republic of\r\nChina.\r\nIn June this year, the international community\r\nadopted the Convention to Combat Desertification in\r\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa. This marks the first\r\nstep of the international community in implementing\r\nAgenda 21 adopted by the Rio Conference. The\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nConvention is also the first global agreement in the field of\r\nprevention of desertification. The countries of the world\r\nhave all attached great importance to the negotiations on\r\nthis Convention and many Heads of State and cabinet\r\nministers delivered speeches emphasizing the importance of\r\nthe Convention for the global environment and the welfare\r\nof mankind. After more than a year of work, the\r\nConvention was finally concluded ahead of schedule. We\r\nwelcome the conclusion of the Convention.\r\nThe problem of desertification has seriously affected\r\nall regions of the world and threatened the lands and living\r\nresources of one quarter of the world’s population.\r\nIn particular, land degradation and continued drought\r\nin developing countries have had exceptionally grim\r\nconsequences for the local population. Desertification has\r\naccelerated the process of impoverishment which, in turn,\r\nhas aggravated the problem of desertification. Undoubtedly,\r\nthis will directly affect the realization of the noble goal of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nChina is faced with the same problem of\r\ndesertification and almost half of its population is\r\nthreatened. The direct economic losses caused by this\r\nproblem have reached as high as $500 million each year.\r\nThe Chinese Government is persevering in its efforts to\r\ncombat desertification and has devoted enormous human\r\nand material resources to that end. We hope that the\r\ninternational community will lend its support to our efforts\r\nto check the process of desertification more effectively. The\r\nConvention has indeed been concluded at an opportune\r\nmoment. We support it and hope that it will promote\r\ninternational cooperation in the prevention of desertification\r\nand alleviation of drought.\r\nThe Chinese Government sent a delegation to Paris\r\nheaded by a cabinet minister to participate in the signing\r\nceremony and to sign the Convention, and we are currently\r\nearnestly making all the necessary preparations for the\r\nimplementation of the Convention and participation in\r\ninternational cooperation in the related areas.\r\nThe Chinese delegation believes that it is in the\r\ninterest of such cooperation in related areas that the system\r\nof international cooperation was initially established by the\r\nConvention under the terms of which help will be given by\r\ndeveloped countries to developing countries, and especially\r\nAfrican countries, in the field of desertification prevention.\r\nIn the course of negotiations, developed countries expressed\r\npositively their intention to join in such cooperation. For\r\nthis, we wish to express our appreciation.\r\nHowever, it should be pointed out that, generally\r\nspeaking, rights and obligations defined by the\r\nConvention are not balanced. This is mainly reflected in\r\nthe fact that developed countries have failed to undertake\r\nsubstantial commitments as to ways in which they can\r\nhelp developing countries fulfil Convention obligations,\r\nespecially in terms of financial resources and\r\nmechanisms. Some international programmes of action in\r\nthis field once existed. Shortage of financial resources\r\nwas a major reason for past unsuccessful efforts to\r\nprevent desertification. According to statistics, the average\r\nper capita fund required for desertification prevention in\r\nthe areas concerned should be $12, but the current actual\r\nfund for each person is only $1. This serious shortage of\r\nfunds casts a dark cloud over the realization of\r\nConvention objectives.\r\nThe world’s land surface is eroding from the effects\r\nof desertification and people of desert-ridden developing\r\ncountries are living in untold misery. We urge the\r\ninternational community, and especially developed\r\ncountries, to fulfil the commitments they made at the Rio\r\nConference and to try their best to help developing\r\ncountries by providing them with financial resources and\r\ntechnology. Only in this way can global desertification be\r\ngenuinely checked in the interest of all mankind. China,\r\nas a victim of desertification and a developing country, is\r\nwilling to work with other members of the international\r\ncommunity in a concerted effort to realize the objectives\r\nset forth in the Convention.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is a great honour for me to speak on behalf\r\nof the countries involved in the work of the political\r\ncoordination and consultation machinery known as the\r\nRio Group, that is, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia,\r\nEcuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama,\r\nParaguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and my own\r\ncountry, Brazil.\r\nI hope to be able to convey to the Assembly the\r\nhopes and fears of this group of countries with regard to\r\nthe very important issue of the fight against desertification\r\nand drought. Its importance has been very properly\r\nrecognized in this Hall by those who have already spoken.\r\nHowever, I deem it necessary to add a few thoughts with\r\na view to expanding and perhaps enhancing the dialogue\r\non this subject.\r\nI should also like to express the profound\r\nappreciation of our countries for the outstanding job done\r\nby Ambassador Bo Kjellén, Chairman of the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee on the\r\nConvention. We are sure that his contribution played a\r\ndecisive role as the complex negotiations unfolded.\r\nDesertification is one of the four central issues that are\r\nbeing dealt with as priority items in the Commission for\r\nSustainable Development. The other three are forests,\r\nbiological diversity and land use. Our countries have been\r\nsupporting the Commission’s efforts to promote specific\r\nactivities likely to attain the goals set with regard to\r\nsustainability. Desertification, along with the other sectoral\r\nissues, is thus an extremely important issue at the Rio\r\nConference.\r\nThe affirmation I have just made on behalf of our\r\ncountries is based on our deep awareness of the reality of\r\nlife in our countries where both Governments and peoples\r\nthroughout society are engaged in a permanent struggle\r\nagainst desertification and drought\r\nWe therefore take the view that the international\r\ncommunity as a whole must also devote special attention to\r\nthe challenge posed by desertification, just as it does in the\r\ntreaties dealing with the related issues of biological\r\ndiversity and forests.\r\nTo varying degrees drought and desertification have\r\nadversely affected 75 per cent of the land surface in Latin\r\nAmerica. The degradation of the land in arid, semi-arid and\r\nsub-humid areas is the result of a number of factors,\r\nincluding climatic variations and human activity. In many\r\nparts of our region desertification is advancing at an\r\nastounding rate.\r\nThe main effects of the processes of desertification\r\nthroughout Latin America are less and less fertile soils, a\r\ndecline in crop yields, sedimentation, erosion and rising\r\nlevels of salinity, to name just a few. These processes,\r\nwhich are cumulative and increasing, bring on many\r\nnegative effects in the social, cultural, economic and\r\nenvironmental areas. In social terms, these factors engender\r\npoverty and migration away from rural areas, which leads\r\nto a deterioration in the quality of life for the people. It is\r\nfelt that out of 200 million poor people throughout Latin\r\nAmerica, some 40 million are poor precisely because of\r\ndesertification. The situation is in fact worse yet when one\r\nrecognizes that in our region we have one of the greatest\r\nreserves world wide of biological diversity.\r\nI now focus, by way of an example, on the situation\r\nprevailing in the north-east of Brazil. In that region,\r\n55 per cent of the land is threatened with desertification.\r\nThe deterioration process has severely affected\r\n4.3 per cent of the land; an additional 20.3 per cent is at\r\nrisk; and we are witnessing an advance of desertification,\r\nalbeit at a moderate pace, in a further 30.6 per cent. The\r\nproblem in Brazil, therefore, is just as bad as it is\r\nelsewhere. More than 18 million people are affected,\r\nwhich translates into serious social pressures.\r\nIt should be stressed that this picture stems primarily\r\nfrom the deterioration of the terms of trade and from\r\ncommercial trade practices that distorted the markets for\r\nthe products of agriculture, fisheries and forestry. In\r\nsocial terms, we are all aware of the results:\r\nimpoverishment, migration, domestic displacement and a\r\nserious deterioration of the quality of life of the local\r\ncommunities and of the people in general.\r\nThe countries of Brazil consider it necessary for\r\nmajor amounts of resources to be allocated to fighting\r\ndesertification and drought if we are to achieve global\r\nand, therefore, lasting results. They consider it important\r\nto expand international cooperation so as to secure from\r\nthe developed countries new and significant financial\r\nresources that are predictable, sustained and reliable. The\r\nappearance of such support would be proof of a genuine\r\nwillingness to seek cooperative, world wide, effective and\r\nbalanced solutions to the problems that confront all of\r\nmankind. We recognize also that the problem is of\r\nsupreme importance as far as the African continent is\r\nconcerned: of this there is no doubt.\r\nOur countries fully endorse and subscribe to the\r\ncontent of chapter 12, section II, of Agenda 21,\r\nparticularly as regards the proposals aimed at wiping out\r\npoverty, at promoting sustainable agriculture, at\r\nestablishing systems of information and of monitoring, at\r\ndeveloping, as a matter of priority, preventive systems in\r\nlands that have not yet suffered deterioration and at\r\nencouraging storage and transportation programmes.\r\nThese elements, taken as a whole, would make an\r\ninvaluable contribution to mitigating the problems of\r\nthose who have become refugees because of drought. In\r\nthis context, special consideration should be given to\r\nefforts devoted to educational programmes regarding\r\nenvironmental issues, technical training and, in particular,\r\nthe support of local communities. All these are important\r\nissues in terms of the financing required, which is why\r\ninternational cooperation has to be brought into play decisively.\r\nJust a few days ago the Convention on\r\ndesertification was opened for signature in Paris. This\r\nConvention is part of a new category of international\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\ninstruments arising from the Rio Conference. It follows a\r\nlong-drawn-out process of negotiation, concluded only quite\r\nrecently: over 18 months of negotiation were required in\r\nNairobi, New York and Geneva before the Paris Agreement\r\nmaterialized in June of this year.\r\nMany expectations and hopes were created and many\r\nplans were made. Alleviating poverty, lessening the\r\nsuffering of local peoples the world over, sharing the\r\nbenefits of development, improving health and the well-\r\nbeing of local peoples — these were the specific goals\r\ntowards which we strove. We still face a difficult\r\nnegotiating process, one in which the developed countries\r\noften depart from the spirit of the Rio deliberations,\r\nparticularly with regard to the concept of global\r\nassociation — characterized by responsibility that is shared\r\nbut also differentiated according to the degree of\r\ndevelopment attained by States — in order to reach the\r\ngoals of sustainable development.\r\nThe negotiation that led to the Convention on\r\ndesertification, has led, in practical terms, to efforts to\r\nreinterpret the Rio Conference consensus, particularly in\r\nterms of international cooperation. The negotiating process\r\nhas been marked by conditionalities, revealing that the\r\ninterest of certain developed countries in this convention\r\nwas minor. Compare the content of related conventions,\r\nsuch as those on climatic change and biological diversity,\r\nwhich entail firmer and fuller commitments regarding the\r\ntransfer of financial resources and of technology. Thus it is\r\nessential that the developed countries take a fresh look at\r\nwhere they stand and that they honour the commitments\r\nthey assumed at the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development in terms of financial support\r\nand the transfer of technology.\r\nA number of Latin American Member States,\r\nincluding Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,\r\nMexico and Peru, have signed the Convention on\r\ndesertification. This means that we also see many positive\r\nfeatures in this instrument. We thus trust that the\r\ninternational community will take advantage of the\r\nopportunities opened up by this Convention and will\r\ntranslate into reality the cooperation the developing\r\ncountries so yearn for. Our countries need to seek\r\ncooperative global solutions to the problems of\r\ndesertification and drought inasmuch as these are problems\r\nthat we share with all mankind. We therefore believe in\r\nconcrete examples that can signal new courses of action on\r\nthis planet. We share the concept that what we need is a\r\ngenuine political will on the part of developed countries to\r\ncontribute to the implementation of initiatives capable of\r\nbreaking the vicious circle of desertification, of drought\r\nand, therefore, of poverty.\r\nThe countries of the Rio group, which share these\r\nviews, hope and expect that implementation of the\r\nConvention will take place in spirit of what was agreed\r\nupon in Rio de Janeiro.\r\nMr. Jallow (Gambia): The successful conclusion of\r\nthe negotiations for the elaboration of the International\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries\r\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\r\nparticularly in Africa, within the time frame set by this\r\naugust body, and the consensus adoption of a Convention\r\ndeserve commendation.\r\nThe negotiating process, which spanned 19 months,\r\nwas not easy or smooth. Reaching an understanding, let\r\nalone a consensus, on certain provisions of the draft\r\nConvention was sometimes almost impossible.\r\nToday, as we review the Convention and its regional\r\nannexes, the feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment\r\nfrom 900 million people around the world affected by\r\ndesertification is even greater. Congratulations are\r\ntherefore in order and in this connection my delegation\r\nwould like to congratulate Chairman Bo Kjellén,\r\nAmbassador Araba Jallow, the other members of the\r\nbureau and all participants who worked tirelessly and\r\nfrankly to make the adoption of the Convention possible.\r\nThe need for an international Convention to combat\r\ndesertification has alway been a crucial factor in Africa’s\r\nnegotiations on environmental issues and related\r\nproblems. Desertification is a problem affecting all\r\nregions of our continent, with a negative impact on our\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe Gambia, a Sahelian country, has suffered from\r\nsevere periods of drought coupled with the threat of\r\nengulfment by a creeping Sahara desert. Since the 1980s\r\ndrought has accounted for the reversal in the country’s\r\nsocio-economic development. Desertification has also\r\naggravated the problems caused by drought. Annually, we\r\nlose a large number of livestock, and the migration of\r\npeople in search of arable land and water is becoming\r\nmore frequent.\r\nThe effects of desertification and drought on land\r\ndegradation and the disruption of the ecological balance\r\nhave always been a cause of concern to my Government.\r\nThe serious efforts of my Government to combat\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\ndesertification and mitigate drought through the allocation\r\nof greater resources and other measures have yielded some\r\nfruitful results but have not reversed the situation. It is for\r\nthese reasons that my delegation welcomes the Convention\r\nand the resolution on priority action for Africa in\r\nimplementation of the Convention.\r\nRecognition of the global dimension of drought and\r\ndesertification and their disruptive effects on one of the\r\nmost priceless elements of mankind’s heritage, our flora\r\nand fauna, followed by the recently adopted Convention to\r\ncombat desertification and drought, will serve to deepen the\r\ninternational community’s involvement and commitment.\r\nAfrica remains the region of the world worst hit by\r\ndrought and desertification — to such an extent that there\r\nis an increasing loss of land productivity. The population-\r\ngrowth rate far exceeds the rate of food production; arid\r\nand semi-arid lands are being marginalized or wasted; and\r\npoverty and the displacement of people are on the increase.\r\nIt is calculated that the income lost in these ways has risen\r\nfrom $26 billion in 1978 to $42.3 billion annually since\r\n1991.\r\nThe adoption of the Convention signals the long-\r\nawaited concerted international effort and assistance. The\r\nConvention, which reflects the interests and concerns of\r\nStates parties, gives a clear indication of the level and\r\nextent of the task involved as well as the type of\r\ncontributions expected from all parties through international\r\ncooperation and partnership arrangements, including those\r\nmade at the national, subregional and regional levels. The\r\nGambia, in meeting its obligations under the Convention,\r\nwill continue to review and improve its national action\r\nprogrammes in the hope of synchronizing them with those\r\nof other States parties at the subregional, regional and\r\nglobal levels. These programmes will be linked to the\r\ncountry’s national sustainable-development policies.\r\nThe implementation of these programmes to combat\r\ndesertification has involved considerable technological and\r\nfinancial resources that are beyond the capability of my\r\ncountry. These constraints, coupled with growing concern\r\nat the ever-present twin evils of drought and desertification,\r\ncontinue to strengthen our resolve that the best and most\r\neffective method to combat desertification and drought is to\r\nassume a collective global approach.\r\nThe successful and efficient operation of the global\r\nmechanism will depend on the collective support and\r\ncontributions of all the States parties. It is only in this way\r\nthat we can coordinate our efforts and develop realistic and\r\ncoherent long-term initiatives in addressing desertification\r\nand drought. We call on the international community to\r\ncontinue to cooperate in the implementation of this\r\nConvention and in the so urgently needed provision of\r\nmore coordinated assistance to Africa, which continues to\r\nsuffer acutely and without respite from desertification and\r\ndrought.\r\nLastly, my delegation strongly supports the adoption\r\nof a resolution that will enable the secretariat of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee to continue to\r\nfunction during the interim period before the Convention\r\nenters into force.\r\nMr. Cissé (Senegal) (interpretation from French): It\r\nneed hardly be recalled that the elaboration of an\r\ninternational convention to combat desertification in those\r\ncountries experiencing serious drought and/or\r\ndesertification, particularly in Africa, was an African\r\ninitiative that received the support of the international\r\ncommunity. This Convention, which arose from a\r\nrecommendation in Agenda 21 of the Rio Conference, is\r\na new step towards the goal of sustainable development.\r\nThus, the Convention, that will now be known as the\r\nParis Convention to Combat Desertification, was signed\r\nby 87 States on 14 and 15 October 1994 at the\r\nheadquarters of the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris.\r\nThe Convention defines “desertification” as\r\nreduction or loss, in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid\r\nareas, of the biological or economic productivity resulting\r\nfrom deterioration of the properties of soil, from soil\r\nerosion, and from degradation and long-term loss of\r\nnatural vegetation. In other words, the Convention allows\r\nthe issue of desertification to be addressed in terms not\r\nonly of its physical, biological or climactic causes but\r\nalso its economic and social aspects, including the\r\nproblem of poverty. It is thus a legal instrument that\r\nsolemnly commits States parties to cooperating in a spirit\r\nof solidarity in taking up the global challenge of\r\nenvironment and development. Moreover, the global\r\ndimension of desertification and drought has been\r\nestablished by the recognition that priority must be\r\naccorded to Africa in the combat against desertification,\r\nas stated in General Assembly resolution 47/188 and\r\nforcefully reaffirmed in an operational annex\r\naccompanying the annexes relating specifically to other\r\nregions.\r\nThe desertification Convention is a new approach to\r\ncooperation and partnership between North and South,\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nbetween the industrialized and the developing countries,\r\nwith a view to better mobilizing resources to combat\r\ndesertification, either in the elaboration and implementation\r\nof programmes or in research and information technologies\r\nthat stress traditional know-how and local technologies. The\r\nConvention is innovative because action will take place at\r\nevery level and will be based on the effective participation\r\nof the affected populations and on cooperation with donors,\r\ninternational and regional institutions and non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nThe consultation process should result in partnership\r\nagreements that will ensure better coordination of bilateral\r\nand multilateral cooperative activities. The aim of the\r\nConvention is above all to help the populations of affected\r\nareas to establish the conditions of an environment\r\nconducive to sustainable development. Indeed, only\r\nconcrete results in the field will allow us to gauge the\r\neffectiveness of programmes and measures intended to\r\neradicate poverty and guarantee food security and renewed\r\nsustainable rural development. In this context, the\r\nConvention to combat desertification brings hope to those\r\npopulations whose daily lives are affected by the scourge of\r\nland degradation and natural resources in arid, semi-arid\r\nand and dry sub-humid areas.\r\nTo be sure, an enterprise on such a scale requires\r\nfinancial and technical resources sufficient to combat\r\ndesertification on Earth, where almost one billion men and\r\nwomen suffer from the effects of desertification and\r\ndrought.\r\nIt is therefore urgent, through creative and fruitful\r\ninternational cooperation, to take up that challenge on the\r\nAfrican continent — cradle of humankind, repository of\r\nimmense potential wealth, but home, as well, to the two\r\nlargest deserts in the world.\r\nAgainst that background, the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development will have to pay particular\r\nattention to the viable management of land and water\r\nresources; the utilization of soils; sustainable agriculture;\r\nforests, dry lands and mountains; and to sources of energy.\r\nThe Convention offers the possibility of solving those\r\nproblems by relying on scientific and technical knowledge\r\nand by giving a powerful boost to the will to cooperate and\r\nto international solidarity.\r\nIn any case, the Convention, as a legal instrument,\r\nprovides the tools and follow-up machinery to assess,\r\nthrough informatics and telecommunications, the promotion\r\nof the observation, collection, analysis and systematic\r\nexchange of data in matters of preventing drought and\r\ncontrolling desertification.\r\nThe Paris Convention on desertification is not a\r\nmeaningless construct but rather the common achievement\r\nof all those who took part in difficult and serious\r\nnegotiations aimed at defining the responsibilities and\r\nmutual obligations of all partners, for the greater good of\r\nhumankind.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to congratulate all the\r\nnegotiators and to express our gratitude to the President\r\nof the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee,\r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Bo Kjellén, who directed the\r\nwork of that group with great effectiveness and finesse.\r\nLet me also express our gratitude to Mr. Hama Arba\r\nDiallo, that worthy son of Africa, who has been assuming\r\ncompetently and devotedly the functions of Executive\r\nSecretary of the Committee, assisted by a dynamic team\r\nwhose reputation is well established.\r\nSenegal, which signed the Convention, will as of\r\nnow undertake the ratification procedure with the firm\r\nhope that this new instrument will allow us to better test\r\nthe beginnings of a new spirit of solidarity and\r\ncooperation for sustainable development in all parts of the\r\nworld, especially in Africa.\r\nSo let us look to the future, as did St. Exupéry, a\r\npoet of action, a great humanist and a man who knew\r\nabout outer space and deserts, who said:\r\n“To be human means precisely to be responsible. It\r\nmeans feeling ashamed in the face of a poverty that\r\ndoes not seem to depend on oneself. It means that,\r\nwhen laying a building block, you are contributing\r\nto building the world.”\r\nMay this message, rich in fraternity, light our way in the\r\nstruggle against desertification on the planet.\r\nCloser to us, just a few months ago, Pierre Gilles\r\ndeGennes, graduate of the Ecole normale supérieure and\r\nNobel laureate in physics, said that the struggle against\r\ndesertification is a project that should mobilize technical\r\nand scientific knowhow, financial resources, the\r\nenthusiasm of youth and human solidarity.\r\nFor its part, Senegal feels that the commitments\r\nundertaken and the contribution announcements made, on\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nboth the bilateral and multilateral levels, at the signing\r\nceremony of the Convention in Paris are a promising\r\nfoundation for the future.\r\nWe are convinced that once the Convention is ratified\r\nand implemented, it will have to live up to the immense\r\nhopes raised by the advent of such an international\r\ninstrument for combating desertification with the aim of\r\nfostering sustainable development in Africa and in the\r\nworld.\r\nMr. Gallegos (United States of America): We have\r\nbefore us a number of issues regarding the recently\r\nconcluded United Nations Convention on Desertification.\r\nThese are procedural matters, with one important exception:\r\nthe resolution on urgent action for Africa.\r\nThe United States signed the Convention in Paris on\r\nOctober 14, and we have been among its strongest\r\nsupporters from the outset. The objective of this agreement\r\nis the sustainable development of dry lands worldwide. Its\r\nrelevance to the economic development and environmental\r\nhealth of a significant proportion of the world’s population\r\nis well known. Its implementation will be of critical\r\nimportance in achieving food security and ending the threat\r\nof malnutrition and famine in Africa. The United States has\r\nidentified approximately $500 million in current or planned\r\nprojects which can be utilized to support the Convention in\r\na number of ways.\r\nThe specific issues before us are as follows:\r\nFirst, with respect to “Urgent action for Africa”\r\n(A/49/84/Add.2, resolution 5/1), this proposal calls on all\r\nparties concerned to begin taking steps to prepare for the\r\nimplementation of the Convention, even before it enters\r\ninto force. We strongly support this provision. The\r\nConvention mandates a locally initiated implementation\r\nprocess featuring partnership arrangements between local\r\ncommunities and non-governmental organizations, national\r\nGovernments, and, where necessary, aid donors, centered in\r\nnational capitals.\r\nThis process was designed to reflect the reality that\r\ncircumstances vary greatly from country to country and that\r\nimplementation cannot be driven by a formula imposed\r\nfrom outside.\r\nNow is the time for African countries to begin\r\nconsidering how they want to use this Convention to meet\r\ntheir own anti-desertification priorities, to begin thinking\r\nabout the kind of local partnerships they want, and to\r\nsurvey the state of their existing anti-desertification plans\r\nand programmes. The purpose of this resolution is to\r\nencourage support for this vital preparation phase so as to\r\njump-start the implementation process when the\r\nConvention enters into force. We strongly support the\r\nresolution and trust that it will not be in any way\r\ncontroversial.\r\nSecondly, with respect to the dates and duration of\r\nmeetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee, the Committee’s draft resolution\r\n(A/49/84/Add.2, resolution 5/2) was approved at the last\r\nCommittee session in Paris. In the intense period of final\r\nnegotiations, there was no time to discuss its contents.\r\nThe two-week period was originally proposed at a time\r\nwhen it was believed that additional regional annexes\r\nwould remain to be negotiated, but, thanks to the hard\r\nwork of everyone concerned, all the annexes in question\r\nwere approved.\r\nThe major challenge facing the Convention now is\r\nimplementation of that “Urgent action”. Other major\r\npolicy issues, such as the organization to house the Global\r\nMechanism — Article 21 — cannot be decided before the\r\nfirst session of the Conference of the Parties. As noted\r\nabove, we see “Urgent action” as a process that must\r\nbegin in African capitals. This is where our focus should\r\nbe for the time being, and it is for that reason that we\r\nhave proposed reducing the January session to one week\r\nonly. None of us has the resources to devote to meetings\r\nof this kind unless they are absolutely necessary.\r\nSimilarly, we are not convinced that another two-\r\nweek session in Nairobi in May is necessary. In our view,\r\ndiscussion of further meetings in 1996 and beyond should\r\nbe deferred until the one-week January session of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee. I repeat that in\r\nour view the time and attention of all concerned should\r\nbe focused on African capitals in the period between now\r\nand the first session of the Conference of Parties.\r\nThe responsibilities of the secretariat were the\r\nsubject of considerable discussion at the fifth session of\r\nthe Committee, and the results are contained in article 23\r\nof the Convention. Further modifications could be made\r\nby the Conference of Parties, in accordance with article\r\n23 (2) (e). I mention this because at least one document\r\nnow before us envisages a role for the secretariat\r\nconsiderably broader than that contained in article 23. I\r\nrefer in particular to paragraph 13 of the report of the\r\nSecretary General, document A/49/477 of 5 October 1994,\r\nwhich suggests that the secretariat should assume the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nconsiderable burden of reviewing the preparation of action\r\nprogrammes and other activities undertaken under the\r\nurgent-action resolution. We strongly believe that any\r\nresolution adopted at this time should be consistent with,\r\nand not go beyond, article 23 of the Convention, as well as\r\nparagraph 14 of the proposed draft resolution on urgent\r\naction and paragraph 5 of the proposed draft resolution on\r\ninterim arrangements.\r\nMr. Eteffa (Ethiopia): My delegation would like first\r\nof all to congratulate Ambassador Bo Kjellén, Chairman of\r\nthe Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee, and\r\nMr. Hama Arba Diallo and other members of the\r\nsecretariat, for their tireless efforts in producing this\r\nexemplary international instrument.\r\nWe would like to endorse the statement made by\r\nAmbassador Lamamra of Algeria, on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and China on the very important issue under\r\nconsideration.\r\nWe recall that during its forty-seventh session, in\r\n1992, the General Assembly adopted resolution 47/188,\r\ncalling for the establishment of the Intergovernmental\r\nNegotiating Committee for the Elaboration of an\r\nInternational Convention to Combat Desertification in\r\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, particularly in Africa, with a view to\r\nfinalizing such a convention by June 1994. Thus, the\r\nInternational Convention to combat desertification and\r\ndrought has been finalized on time and, in addition, a\r\nconsiderable number of countries have already signed,\r\nduring the recent signing ceremony held in Paris. We\r\ncommend this achievement and urge those countries that\r\nhave not yet signed to do so as soon as possible. We also\r\nask those countries that have signed the Convention to take\r\nall necessary measures to expedite the ratification process.\r\nThe finalization of the text of the Convention is a\r\ngreat stride forward in our endeavour to tackle the problems\r\nof drought and desertification. However, the Convention is\r\nnot an end in itself. What is most important is that we\r\nshould focus on implementing the objectives of the\r\nConvention. The question of speedy implementation of this\r\ninternational instrument is most relevant in Africa, where\r\n50 to 60 per cent of the land area has been desertified and\r\nwhere millions of people face recurrent and devastating\r\ndrought, famine and starvation.\r\nIt is true that all regions of the world suffer from\r\ndesertification and drought, but the African nations are the\r\nmost vulnerable and are the least able to combat these\r\nproblems without meaningful international cooperation,\r\npartnership and assistance. That is why we in Africa are\r\nvery concerned about the financial resources for the\r\nimplementation of the Convention.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation would like to appeal\r\nonce again to our partners in developed countries and in\r\nthe United Nations system to make available adequate,\r\ntimely and predictable financial resources and technical\r\nassistance, especially for the least developed and most\r\nseverely affected African countries.\r\nMoreover, a series of consultation meetings should\r\nbe conducted between the adoption of the Convention and\r\nthe first meeting of the Conference of Parties; it is\r\nimperative to ensure the effective participation in this\r\nprocess of developing countries, in particular the least\r\ndeveloped among them. Therefore, my delegation appeals\r\nto Governments and organizations to make voluntary\r\ncontributions to the extrabudgetary fund established under\r\nresolution 47/188.\r\nEthiopia, as one of the most severely affected\r\ncountries, is fully aware of its responsibility to fight the\r\nproblems of drought that threaten the lives of millions of\r\nits people. With this in view, the Ethiopian Government\r\nhas taken important measures to mitigate the effects of\r\nrecurrent drought. Recently we finalized a national\r\nconservation strategy and commenced a $1.2-billion-dollar\r\nforestry action programme. The decentralization and\r\ndemocratization process initiated by the Transitional\r\nGovernment of Ethiopia some three years ago has created\r\nan excellent environment conducive to the participation of\r\nthe local people in the preparation and implementation of\r\nthe development and environmental-protection action\r\nprogrammes. We in Ethiopia feel that the participation of\r\nthe people at all levels is of paramount importance.\r\nThe Ethiopian Government has also adopted a\r\ndisaster-prevention and preparedness policy and strategies\r\nand has established disaster preparedness committees at\r\nthe central, regional, zonal and community levels. These\r\nand other measures taken by Ethiopia demonstrate the\r\nGovernment’s commitment to combating drought and\r\ndesertification. However, we realize that national efforts\r\nwill not bear fruit without the support of the international\r\ncommunity. That is why we urge the immediate\r\nimplementation of urgent action for Africa as stipulated\r\nin resolution 5/1 adopted during the fifth session of the\r\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nThe question of drought and desertification and\r\nhow to combat them should be seen in the light of African\r\neconomic and social development. The implementation of\r\nthe objectives of the Convention should be carried out with\r\nthe close cooperation of the Economic Commission for\r\nAfrica, the Organization of African Unity and other\r\ninternational and intergovernmental organizations. The\r\nsolution to the multifaceted and critical problems of Africa\r\ncan be found only in a unified and integrated approach to\r\ndevelopment. The Convention at hand should thus\r\ncomplement that approach by effectively addressing\r\nproblems related to drought and desertification.\r\nIn the light of the critical and fast-deteriorating\r\nsituation prevailing in Africa, the Convention, especially in\r\nits article 7, gives explicit priority to that continent.\r\nTherefore, my delegation feels that it is most appropriate\r\nthat the Convention secretariat should be located in Africa.\r\nHowever, the question of the permanent secretariat,\r\nincluding its exact location in Africa, should be a subject of\r\ndiscussion during the Conference of Parties. My delegation\r\nwill present concrete proposals in that connection at the\r\nappropriate time and place.\r\nMr. Pak (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nMr. Muthaura (Kenya): I wish to join the delegations\r\nthat have spoken before me in welcoming the conclusion of\r\nthe elaboration of the International Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa.\r\nI wish also to express our congratulations to the\r\nChairman of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee,\r\nAmbassador Bo Kjellén of Sweden, and the Secretariat, in\r\nparticular Ambassador Diallo, for having steered the\r\nnegotiating process so ably within the time-frame and\r\nachieving this important Convention. It is significant that\r\nmany countries have already signed the Convention, and\r\nsome countries have already made substantial financial\r\npledges in its support. We hope that the ratification process\r\nwill be completed as quickly as possible so that the\r\nConvention may enter into force.\r\nCountries such as my own, which are prone to drought\r\nand desertification, have great expectations from the\r\nimplementation of the Action Programmes contained in the\r\nConvention. At the national level, Action Programmes\r\nembrace the mobilization of local populations and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, as well as scientific and\r\ntechnological efforts, within an integrated long-term policy\r\ncommitment for combating and mitigating the effects of\r\ndrought and desertification. At the international level, a\r\ncritical element in ensuring the success of the strategy, as\r\nenvisaged in the Convention, is the establishment of a\r\nfinancial mechanism to promote actions leading to the\r\nmobilization and channelling of substantial financial\r\nresources, with emphasis on multiple-source financing. In\r\nthis regard, stress has been put on partnership agreements\r\nbringing together affected countries, developed and other\r\ncountries as well as international organizations, to support\r\nthe preparation and implementation of the Action\r\nProgrammes. In our view, the concrete responses that the\r\nConvention will be able to attract from donor countries\r\nand international organizations in terms of resource\r\nallocations will, by and large, determine the impact the\r\nConvention will have on the local mobilization efforts to\r\ntackle the drought and desertification effects on the\r\nenvironment and achieve sustainable development. We\r\ntherefore appeal to the donor community to make\r\navailable sufficient resources to the Convention’s\r\nfinancing mechanism.\r\nIt is fitting that the Convention on desertification and\r\ndrought has been adopted at the time when the\r\ninternational community has adopted the Plan of Action\r\nfor Population and Development and is preparing for the\r\nrelated World Summit for Social Development, the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women and the Habitat II\r\nConference, all of which are aimed at tackling the\r\nproblems of poverty and environmental degradation and\r\nmobilizing efforts towards the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment from different perspectives. Desertification\r\nand drought deprive the population of the basic\r\nrequirements of livelihood, food, water, firewood and\r\nshelter. The impact of this scenario is experienced in\r\nAfrica more than in other regions, inasmuch as 66 per\r\ncent of the continent is desert or dry land and 73 per cent\r\nof the agricultural dry lands are already degraded.\r\nThe interim measures which have been proposed by\r\nthe Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee, especially\r\nwith regard to the need for an adequate financial\r\nallocation to support the interim secretariat and\r\nCommittee meetings, are practicable and, therefore, we\r\nsupport them. We also consider the proposal by the\r\nSecretariat for provisions to convene two Committee\r\nmeetings in 1995, two meetings in 1996 and one meeting\r\nin 1997 to be reasonable for planning purposes, without\r\nexcluding the possibility of additional meetings if the\r\nCommittee deems them necessary.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nFinally, may I take this opportunity to thank the\r\ncountries that have generously contributed to the voluntary\r\nfund which supported the participation of delegations from\r\ndeveloping countries in the negotiating process. We hope\r\nthat the fund will be replenished to assist the participation\r\nof those delegations during the interim period.\r\nMs. Mompei (Botswana): Botswana, as one of the\r\nmany countries around the globe, and particularly in Africa,\r\nwhich is grossly affected by both drought and\r\ndesertification, welcomes the successful conclusion of the\r\nnegotiations on the elaboration of an International\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Countries\r\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nBotswana participated in the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED)\r\nheld at Rio de Janeiro in 1992, at which countries displayed\r\ninterest and concern on the issue of drought and\r\ndesertification. Botswana’s interest in this issue culminated\r\nin its participation in the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee.\r\nThe adverse climatic conditions of Botswana dictate\r\nour need to recognize this important international initiative.\r\nIn Botswana, the desert occupies about 80 per cent of the\r\ntotal land area. It is characterized by frequent and\r\nprolonged droughts, erratic rainfall patterns, sand layers of\r\nup to 1 metre or more in certain areas, unbearably high\r\nsummer temperatures and a thinly distributed savanna-type\r\nof vegetation. In addition, the socio-economic factors,\r\nwhich include the unevenly distributed and fast-growing\r\npopulation, the concentrated livestock-rearing activities and\r\nthe poor arable farming practices, aggravate the already\r\nvulnerable landscape of Botswana.\r\nAt the national level, land degradation has always\r\nbeen of major concern to Botswana. Different land\r\nministries have drawn up policies and programmes and\r\neven enacted laws to address this issue. In 1990, my\r\nGovernment formulated a strategy and established the\r\nBotswana National Conservation Strategy Agency, whose\r\naims are, first, to increase the effectiveness with which\r\nnatural resources are used and managed so that interactions\r\nare optimized and harmful environmental side-effects\r\nminimized and, secondly, to integrate the work of the many\r\nsectoral ministries and interest groups throughout Botswana,\r\nthereby improving the development of natural resources\r\nthrough conservation and so forth.\r\nThe recommendations of the Rio Summit and now\r\nthe Convention to combat drought and desertification will\r\ncomplement the existing national efforts to address these\r\nenvironmental issues. For instance, Botswana has\r\nprepared an action plan for the Boteti area, which is in\r\nthe central part of the country, with the financial\r\nassistance of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee of the Convention.\r\nNational efforts to combat desertification become\r\nmeaningless if regional cooperation is lacking. In this\r\ncontext, Botswana has started to consult its neighbours to\r\nprepare the Kgalagadi-Namib Action Plan to combat\r\ndesertification. The Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC), which is a subregional body, can\r\nalso be used to foster this kind of cooperation. It is hoped\r\nthat this Plan, which includes Angola, Namibia,\r\nBotswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe, will in the foreseeable\r\nfuture welcome South Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, we urge the international community\r\nto work tirelessly towards achieving the objectives of this\r\nimportant Convention.\r\nMr. Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The two scourges of desertification and drought\r\nassail all the regions of our planet and have increasingly\r\nand continually caused the disappearance of vegetation\r\nand fertile soils. Chapter 12 of Agenda 21 raised the\r\nurgent need of facing up to this problem.\r\nOn 14 October last in Paris 87 States signed the\r\ninternational Convention to Combat Desertification in\r\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa. This came about as\r\na result of an African initiative decided upon in Abidjan\r\nin November 1991 and introduced in Rio de Janeiro at the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment. The legal framework thus laid down\r\nassures a balance between recognition of the global nature\r\nof the desertification problem and recognition of the\r\nspecific nature of regional situations.\r\nThe negotiating process was difficult, intense and\r\nrewarding. Ambassador Bo Kjellén deserves our gratitude\r\nfor the devotion, experience and inexhaustible patience he\r\ndemonstrated in leading a particularly dynamic Bureau,\r\nwith the assistance of an effective secretariat led by\r\nAmbassador Hama Arba Diallo. All involved should be\r\nthanked for the accomplishment of their task, which\r\nmarked the beginning of a new stage in the battle against\r\ndesertification and drought.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nWe now have a legal instrument that is innovative in\r\nmany ways and that recognizes the integrated approach as\r\na suitable way to achieve security for the environment and\r\nfor development. The fight against desertification will thus\r\nintegrate socio-economic and cultural realities within an\r\nenvironmental context. The annexed resolution on “Urgent\r\naction for Africa” envisages, inter alia, a partnership\r\nbetween local populations and non-governmental\r\norganizations in the development and execution of\r\nprogrammes of action, as well as the integration of\r\nprogrammes of action aimed at combating desertification\r\nand mitigating the effects of drought into national policies\r\nfor sustainable development.\r\nBurkina Faso, which is the site of the headquarters of\r\nthe Inter-State Committee on combating drought in the\r\nSahel, has implemented a national programme of action for\r\nthe environment whose elements are inspired by all of the\r\nforegoing. While Africa is not the only region affected and\r\nafflicted, it is there where the ravages of drought and\r\ndesertification have occurred fastest and been most serious.\r\nThe Sahel is evidence of this fact.\r\nThe phenomenon of desertification affects 25 per cent\r\nof our planet. Sixty-six per cent of the African continent is\r\naffected. Of the 600 million people in Africa, 185 million\r\nare affected, in more than 40 countries.\r\nGiven the lack of results from the Nairobi Programme\r\nof Action of 1977, the acuteness of this ecological problem\r\nand its repercussions on Africa’s economy and social\r\nfoundations have been such that only a concerted, solid and\r\nactive strategy against desertification and drought could be\r\nseen as a beginning in solving a problem that, through both\r\nits extent and its effects, affects the entire planet.\r\nThis is fundamental. One can never emphasize too\r\nmuch that the necessary resources must be provided and the\r\ninstitutional financial and follow-up machinery called for in\r\nthe Convention must become operational as early as\r\npossible.\r\nMy delegation places its hopes in resolute, vigorous\r\nimplementation of the concept of partnership and solidarity\r\nin the fight against desertification so that those societies\r\nthat have been weakened by this scourge can be restored to\r\nnormalcy and so that, wherever the environment has been\r\nwounded, it can be healed to the greatest extent possible.\r\nThis must be done so that many, many human beings\r\nin many places can, as we dream in the Sahel, finally\r\nexperience again the soft wind over the grass, heading for\r\nthe trees in the distance.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 2011 (XX) of 11 October 1965, I\r\nnow call on the Observer for the Organization of African\r\nUnity.\r\nMr. Sy (Organization of African Unity): The\r\nOrganization of African Unity welcomes the conclusion\r\nof the negotiations and the signing of the international\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries\r\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\r\nParticularly in Africa. We see this as an important step\r\ntowards the implementation of Agenda 21, as agreed upon\r\nby the international community in Rio de Janeiro in June\r\n1992.\r\nIn this respect, my delegation would also like to\r\nacknowledge the hard work and dedication of the\r\nChairman of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\r\nCommittee, Ambassador Bo Kjellén, the Executive\r\nSecretary, Ambassador Arba Diallo, and the other\r\nmembers of the Committee, all of whom ensured that the\r\nConvention was prepared by the deadline.\r\nThe Convention is very significant for Africa, as it\r\nis directly related to some of the primary issues at the\r\nheart of underdevelopment and the aggravation of poverty\r\nin many African countries. For many African countries\r\ndesert encroachment and increasing bouts of drought are\r\nissues which deserve urgent solutions in order to increase\r\nagricultural output and to assure a better and higher\r\nstandard of living for the growing population. In this\r\ncontext, African countries have, at both the individual and\r\ncollective levels, felt that enough resources should be\r\nmobilized to cope with the technical demands and lead to\r\na permanent solution. The devastating effects of\r\ndesertification and drought must be checked if Africa is\r\nto have a firm basis for sustainable development.\r\nWith this objective in view, African countries have\r\ncollectively, through the Organization of African Unity,\r\nworked very hard with their partners in the international\r\ncommunity for the conclusion of an instrument which\r\nwould enhance their efforts at sustainable development.\r\nThe high interest in, and dedication to, the\r\nimplementation of the Convention is illustrated in the\r\nCouncil of Ministers’ resolution CM/RES 1535 (LX) of\r\nJune 1994, which inter alia, requests the OAU Secretary-\r\nGeneral to take appropriate steps as part of the execution\r\nof the international Convention and the Regional\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nImplementation Annex for Africa to establish institutional\r\nand operational links with regional economic communities\r\nand intergovernmental institutions.\r\nThe United Nations Convention to combat\r\ndesertification is unique, as it is basically concerned with\r\nthe elaboration of action programmes at the national and\r\nsubregional levels, through a consultative and participatory\r\nprocess. Among other things, it consists of a strategy which\r\nunderscores the participation of local populations and\r\nnon-governmental organizations in the preparation and\r\nimplementation of action programmes. Likewise, it\r\nencourages the integration of action programmes in national\r\npolicies for sustainable development. All these policies, we\r\nbelieve, are vital for the implementation of the Convention.\r\nHowever, the Convention will be meaningful in the\r\ncontext of sustainable development if it is implemented\r\neffectively and promptly. At this point, therefore, the OAU\r\nwould like to call on the international community for\r\nincreased political support for and commitment to its\r\nimplementation. National Parliaments should speed up the\r\nprocess of ratification to ensure that the minimum of 50\r\nratifications by Member States required for the Convention\r\nto come into force is secured in the least possible time.\r\nIn addition, the question of funding should continue to\r\nbe reviewed in order to enhance the Convention’s coming\r\ninto operation. The capacity of the Global Environment\r\nFacility to fund the Convention should be strengthened, and\r\nadditional complementary funding arrangements should be\r\nprovided when these are necessary. The whole world stands\r\nto benefit from living on a planet where the menace of\r\ndesertification and drought is effectively contained.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in the\r\ndebate on this agenda sub-item.\r\nIn accordance with the decision taken by the Assembly\r\nat its 30th plenary meeting, action on the sub-item will be\r\ntaken in the Second Committee.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of sub-item (d) of agenda item 89.\r\nAgenda item 22\r\nAssistance in mine clearance\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/49/357 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/49/L.8)\r\nAmendment (A/49/L.11)\r\nThe President: The Assembly has before it a draft\r\nresolution, issued as document A/49/L.8, and an\r\namendment to it, submitted by Honduras, contained in\r\ndocument A/49/L.11.\r\nI call on the representative of Germany to introduce\r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nMr. Henze (Germany): A year ago, at the General\r\nAssembly’s forty-eighth session, the 12 member States of\r\nthe European Community requested the inclusion of the\r\nitem entitled “Assistance in mine clearance” on the\r\nAssembly’s agenda and initiated a draft resolution, which\r\nthe Assembly subsequently adopted without a vote. In\r\ncontinuation of that initiative, I have the honour to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/49/L.8 on behalf of its 63\r\nsponsors. I ask for the Assembly’s indulgence as I read\r\nout the list.\r\nThe sponsors of draft resolution A/49/L.8 are:\r\nAngola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia,\r\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Burundi,\r\nCambodia, Canada, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic,\r\nDenmark, Egypt, El Salvador, Eretria, Estonia, Ethiopia,\r\nFinland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala,\r\nHungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania,\r\nLuxembourg, Malta, Mauritius, Micronesia, Monaco,\r\nMongolia, Mozambique, Netherlands, New Zealand,\r\nNicaragua, Norway, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Republic\r\nof Korea, Romania, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia,\r\nSlovenia, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda,\r\nUkraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\nIreland, United States of America and Viet Nam.\r\nBefore briefly outlining the contents of the draft\r\nresolution, I wish to thank sincerely all the delegations\r\nthat have given it their support and contributed\r\nconstructively to its drafting. I should also like to express\r\nour deep gratitude to the members of the Secretariat who\r\nhave shared their experience with us.\r\nThe reason why we are submitting the draft\r\nresolution remains unchanged since last year. It is the\r\ncatastrophic situation created by the massive presence of\r\nmines and other unexploded devices in countries that have\r\nexperienced armed conflict, a situation that persists and\r\nhas been further aggravated.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nIn the second preambular paragraph of draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.8 the Assembly would affirm its deep concern at the\r\ntremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence\r\nof mines and other unexploded devices. Such devices have\r\nserious and lasting consequences for the populations of\r\naffected countries. They kill and maim, and they constitute\r\nan obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced\r\npersons, to humanitarian aid operations, to reconstruction\r\nand economic development as well as to the restoration of\r\nnormal social conditions.\r\nIn the third and fourth preambular paragraphs the\r\nAssembly would stress its grave alarm at the ever-\r\nincreasing presence of mines and other unexploded devices\r\nas a result of armed conflicts. The Assembly would also\r\nexpress its deep concern that the number of mines laid each\r\nyear exponentially outweighs the number that can be\r\ncleared during that time. As the Secretary-General pointed\r\nout in his report, between 2 million and 5 million mines are\r\nbeing laid each year, to add to the more than 110 million\r\nland mines that have already been laid in 64 countries\r\naround the world.\r\nIn the fifth and sixth preambular paragraphs, the\r\nAssembly would reiterate its dismay at the high number of\r\nvictims of mines, especially among civilian populations, and\r\nbear in mind the serious threat that they constitute to the\r\nsafety, health and lives of personnel participating in\r\nhumanitarian, peace-keeping and rehabilitation programmes.\r\nIn the seventh and eighth preambular paragraphs the\r\nAssembly would recall its resolution 48/79 relating to the\r\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of\r\nCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to\r\nBe Excessively Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate Effects,\r\nand its resolution 48/75 K, calling for a moratorium on the\r\nexport of anti-personnel land-mines.\r\nIn the following preambular paragraphs the Assembly\r\nwould focus on the important role of the United Nations\r\nand on the measures and activities already undertaken.\r\nIn operative paragraph 1 the Assembly would express\r\nits appreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report and would take note with interest of\r\nhis proposals, as well as of the contributions by Member\r\nStates and others.\r\nIn operative paragraphs 2 and 3 the Assembly would\r\nwelcome the establishment by the Secretary-General of a\r\nvoluntary trust fund to finance, in particular, information\r\nand training programmes relating to mine clearance and\r\nto facilitate the launching of mine clearance operations.\r\nThe Assembly would also appeal to Member States and\r\nothers to contribute to the trust fund.\r\nThe following operative paragraphs address the\r\ncoordination role of the United Nations. In operative\r\nparagraph 6, the Assembly would commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his efforts to make use of available\r\nresources to strengthen that role and would encourage him\r\nto continue those efforts with a view to improving the\r\neffectiveness of assistance in mine clearance by the\r\nUnited Nations. In operative paragraph 8 the Assembly\r\nwould urge Member States, regional organizations,\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations and\r\nfoundations to continue to extend full assistance and\r\ncooperation to the Secretary-General and, in particular, to\r\nprovide him with all relevant information and data, as\r\nwell as other pertinent resources which could be useful in\r\nstrengthening the coordination role of the United Nations.\r\nDraft resolution A/49/L.8, which is before the\r\nGeneral Assembly today, reflects the international\r\ncommunity’s great concern at the devastating effects of\r\nmines and other unexploded devices in countries\r\nemerging from armed conflict. On behalf of the sponsors,\r\nI should like to express the hope that it will be adopted\r\nwithout a vote.\r\nI should like to use this opportunity to say a few\r\nwords on behalf of the European Union, Austria, Finland,\r\nNorway and Sweden.\r\nWe have noted with interest the proposals made by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report. Many of them need\r\nfurther careful analysis. Nevertheless, the tremendous\r\naccumulation of anti-personnel land-mines and other\r\nunexploded devices in countries emerging from armed\r\nconflict is an urgent problem that requires a strong and\r\ncoordinated international response. It is precisely the\r\nurgency, indeed the immediacy, of the threat to the lives\r\nand health of a large number of civilians, especially\r\nchildren, that has prompted us to focus this draft\r\nresolution on the humanitarian aspect of the problem.\r\nEach month, more than 800 people are killed and\r\nthousands more are maimed by unexploded devices,\r\nespecially anti-personnel land-mines. Given the high cost\r\nof clearing land mines, in particular when maps or other\r\nrecords showing their locations do not exist, it is of\r\nparamount importance that the available resources be used\r\neffectively and in a coordinated manner.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nThe President: I should like to propose that the list of\r\nspeakers in the debate on this item be now closed.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Maruyama (Japan): Land-mines are one of the\r\nmost troubling problems confronting the international\r\ncommunity in this post-cold-war period.\r\nIt is reported that the number of mines deployed is\r\nincreasing by 500,000 to 1 million each year, and that they\r\nkill more than 800 people every month, while mine\r\ndetection and clearance technology has not made much\r\nprogress.\r\nLand-mines obstruct the peace-building process\r\nconducted by the international community in the aftermath\r\nof conflicts. They hinder, and in some instances prevent,\r\npeace-keeping operations, the delivery of relief supplies, the\r\nrepatriation of refugees and the rehabilitation and\r\nimprovement of basic infrastructure, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral notes in his comprehensive report on this subject.\r\nCountries that have suffered through war must suffer\r\nfurther because of land-mines, which continue to impede\r\nthe process of national reconstruction long afterwards.\r\nThe Secretary-General informs us that there are more\r\nthan 110 million land-mines spread in 64 countries around\r\nthe world — countries such as Afghanistan, Angola,\r\nCambodia and Mozambique — with 2 to 5 million more\r\nlaid each year.\r\nSince de-mining requires a tremendous investment of\r\ntime and money, it is essential that the international\r\ncommunity provide assistance to those countries engaged in\r\nsuch work. In this connection, my delegation would like to\r\nstress the urgency of promoting research and development\r\nin mine detection and clearance technology to make mine\r\nclearance activities safer and more efficient, and requests\r\nthat the United Nations coordinate such research and\r\ndevelopment, in view of the failure of mine detection and\r\nclearance technology to keep pace with the rapid progress\r\nof mine technology. It is also important that the\r\ninternational community consider establishing a mechanism\r\nto restrict the production, use and transfer of all land-mines,\r\nespecially anti-personnel mines.\r\nJapan is pleased that the Department of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs has been named by the Secretary-General to be the\r\nfocal point within the United Nations for all de-mining and\r\nland-mine problems, as well as to provide support,\r\nassistance and advice to other United Nations agencies. The\r\nUnited Nations should play the central role in providing\r\nassistance in mine clearance, with the cooperation of\r\nregional organizations such as the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, and it is highly likely that the role of\r\nthe Department of Humanitarian Affairs as focal point\r\nwithin the United Nations will soon be further\r\nstrengthened. In this context, my delegation takes note\r\nwith great interest of the launching of the database on the\r\nland-mine problem by that Department, in cooperation\r\nwith the Department of Peace-keeping Operations — a\r\ndatabase that is certain to become indispensable to the\r\nformulation of measures on de-mining. Japan also\r\nappreciates the efforts of the Department of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs and the Department of Peace-keeping Operations\r\nto establish a set of standards of operation and safety\r\nprocedures for mine action programmes, as they will\r\nfacilitate coordination of the de-mining efforts of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe note with interest that a voluntary trust fund to\r\nfinance, in particular, information and training\r\nprogrammes relating to mine clearance is being created\r\nunder the management of the Department of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs, and request that the terms of reference, which are\r\nnow being worked out with the Department of\r\nAdministration and Management, be provided to Member\r\nStates. Since adequate financing is necessary for the\r\neffective implementation of the programme, Japan will\r\nconsider carefully the possibility of making a contribution\r\nto the trust fund after the terms of reference are issued. I\r\nwould just add that Japan has provided assistance to\r\nde-mining operations in Somalia and Afghanistan, and in\r\nMarch of this year it gave $2.5 million to the United\r\nNations Development Programme’s Trust Fund for\r\nCapacity-Building in De-Mining Operations for\r\nCambodia.\r\nI have just heard the introductory statement on draft\r\nresolution A/49/L.8 made by the representative of\r\nGermany, Ambassador Henze, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. The draft resolution contains strong arguments and\r\nconstructive proposals, and we note that it stresses the\r\nimportance of coordination by the United Nations of\r\nactivities related to mine clearance. My Government\r\nappreciates the initiative taken by the member countries\r\nof the European Union in drawing the attention of the\r\nworld to this most pressing problem, and it is honoured\r\nto join in sponsoring this draft resolution.\r\nIn concluding my statement, I wish to assure the\r\nPresident of the Assembly that the Government of Japan\r\nwill continue to extend cooperation to efforts to clear\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nmines from the battlefields of the world. Japan hopes that,\r\nfor its part, the United Nations, with its extensive expertise\r\nand experience in this field, will make further efforts to\r\ncoordinate the activities of the international community,\r\nindividual countries and international and non-governmental\r\norganizations, so that together we can achieve an early\r\nsolution to this problem.\r\nMr. Westdal (Canada): Mines and unexploded\r\nordinance pose a serious threat to the lives and livelihoods\r\nof millions of people — mostly civilians — throughout the\r\nworld. Mines threaten peace-keepers and humanitarian\r\nworkers and are a serious obstacle to development. Indeed\r\nin Cambodia the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) identified land-mines as the single biggest\r\nimpediment to that country’s rehabilitation. Canada took the\r\nlead in supporting the Cambodian Mine-Action Centre’s\r\ncontinued operation following the withdrawal of the United\r\nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).\r\nTwelve Canadians still form the nucleus of international\r\nsupport for the Centre.\r\nCanada has been involved in 33 United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping missions around the world. Close to 8,000\r\nCanadian soldiers have risked their lives clearing mines in\r\ncountries such as Kuwait, Afghanistan and Nicaragua. Five\r\nCanadians have been killed or injured. Our soldiers are\r\ntoday clearing mines in Cambodia, Croatia, Bosnia and\r\nRwanda.\r\nCanada welcomes the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nassistance in mine clearance and commends the\r\nestablishment of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs as\r\na focal point within the United Nations for coordinating\r\nmine clearance and related activities.\r\nWe recognize that States have the primary role in\r\nmine-clearing activities, but the United Nations has an\r\nimportant role to play in assisting Member States. We\r\nbelieve that as a focal point for United Nations\r\ncoordination, the Department of Humanitarian Affairs can\r\nprovide invaluable assistance, particularly through mine-\r\nclearing information and training programmes. We also\r\nstrongly support the United Nations’s efforts to establish\r\n“country capacity for mine action” as part of its “nation-\r\nbuilding” programmes.\r\nLong after hostilities have ceased in a region, and\r\nwhen the world’s attention may well be turned elsewhere,\r\nuncleared mines, often numbering hundreds of thousands,\r\ncan pose an overwhelming threat to normal life and to\r\ndevelopment efforts. Countries must be able to establish\r\nand undertake mine-clearing programmes which will\r\nsystematically and effectively ensure the safety of their\r\ncitizens, thereby allowing the most rapid return of each\r\ncountry’s development potential.\r\nCanada welcomes the establishment of the voluntary\r\ntrust fund for mine-clearing activities. Clearing mines is\r\nexpensive. Resources are needed to ensure that the United\r\nNations can fulfil its coordinating role successfully and\r\nefficiently. An example of that role is the current mine-\r\nclearing platoons already in the field in Mozambique,\r\nalong with the secondment of technical advisers, the\r\nestablishment of a school for trainees, and a tender for a\r\nmanagement-training scheme. There is much to be learned\r\nfrom the Department of Humanitarian Affair’s initial\r\ncoordination programmes. We believe that these efforts\r\ncan only lead to a greater coherence in all phases of\r\nUnited Nations involvement. For its part, Canada will\r\ncontinue to contribute to mine clearing in a variety of\r\nways, primarily through peace-keeping operations. The\r\nSecretary-General has estimated that a typical mine-\r\nclearing operation costs between $300 and $l,000 per\r\nmine. Canada would hope and urge that other countries\r\nwould demonstrate a comparable commitment to United\r\nNations mine-clearance efforts by helping, directly or\r\nindirectly, to shoulder the financial burden.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to add Canada’s name to\r\nthe list of sponsors of the draft resolution before the\r\nGeneral Assembly on assistance in mine clearance.\r\nCanada will continue to extend its direct support through\r\nthe practical expertise and technical assistance it has\r\nsponsored throughout the years.\r\nMr. Farhadi (Afghanistan): My delegation does not\r\nfind it necessary to emphasize the disastrous effects of\r\nland-mines, which threaten the present generation of\r\nhumanity, as well as the generations that will follow, in\r\nso many parts of the world. We are very grateful to the\r\ndelegation of Germany, which, in cooperation with other\r\nWestern European States, North European States and\r\nAustralia, worked on the preparation of the draft\r\nresolution now before us in document A/49/L.8.\r\nI recognize the great sympathy of these countries —\r\nGermany, Japan and Canada — whose representatives\r\nspoke before me, for those countries affected by land-\r\nmines. It is important to thank them because they are\r\namong the countries that are helping us, Afghanistan, in\r\nthe work of mine clearance.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nI wish to draw the attention of all those present\r\nhere to the fact that this draft resolution is mainly of a\r\nprocedural character. Although it contains some important\r\npoints, it is mainly a repetition of what was said last year\r\nwhile taking into consideration a few facts.\r\nWe have been in contact with the delegation of\r\nGermany and have had a very friendly exchange of views.\r\nWe are deeply concerned that with the advancement of\r\ntechnology, mines and other explosive devices are\r\nbecoming increasingly non-detectable, or difficult to detect.\r\nThat has been stated in the report but it should appear in\r\none of the texts to be adopted as a resolution. We are\r\ndeeply concerned at the number of mines equipped with\r\nanti-handling devices.\r\nOn the subject of mine-clearance activity around the\r\nworld, it is important to recognize, as experience has\r\nshown, that the most cost-effective clearance teams are\r\nthose composed of civilian mine-clearance workers\r\nrecruited locally and trained by experts provided through\r\ninternational assistance. We must, therefore, call upon\r\nStates and appropriate international organizations and\r\nnon-governmental organizations to promote, as a matter of\r\npriority, scientific research aimed at the rapid advancement\r\nof mine-clearance technology.\r\nThe problem is that the production of land-mines is\r\ntechnologically advanced while mine-clearance technology\r\nlags behind. Something must be done and there are States\r\nand organizations that are able to do something.\r\nWe welcome the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/49/357 and Add.1) and especially the creation of a\r\nsection within the Department of Humanitarian Affairs to\r\ndeal with the matter. But that new section is very small and\r\ncannot cope with all the responsibilities incumbent on it. In\r\norder to enhance the role of the existing mine-clearance\r\nsection and to establish an office of mine clearing under the\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs, it is important that,\r\namong other things, the Secretary-General, should, first,\r\nstudy on a continuing basis the problems of land-mines and\r\nmine clearance in war-stricken countries.\r\nSecondly, it should serve as a coordinating body for\r\nall the activities at the national, subregional and\r\ninternational levels to be performed by non-governmental\r\norganizations in the field of mine awareness, training,\r\nsurvey, mine clearance and scientific research for mine-\r\nclearance technology.\r\nThirdly, where appropriate, the office has to initiate\r\ntripartite agreements between the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, non-governmental organizations and\r\nGovernments concerned, thus ensuring successful mine-\r\nclearance awareness and training projects and\r\nprogrammes.\r\nFourthly, the office has to coordinate and promote\r\nthe activities of Government and non-governmental\r\norganizations that are assisting the developing war-\r\nstricken countries by providing prostheses for adults and\r\nchildren who are victims of land mines and booby traps.\r\nFifthly, the office is to facilitate contacts and\r\npromote the conclusion of agreements between the most\r\naffected countries and the donor Governments and\r\nnon-governmental organizations in the field of mine\r\nclearance.\r\nAll of that is important and is based on long years\r\nof experience by Afghanistan, the country most affected\r\nby land mines after a terrible war of aggression.\r\nAll these points will require many exchanges of\r\nviews. Such exchanges are taking place now, but in a\r\nhaphazard way. My delegation therefore, proposes that,\r\nsince the question is urgent and is becoming progressively\r\nmore disastrous with the passage of time, we decide to\r\nconvene a global conference in 1995 to study the problem\r\nof land-mine and land-mine clearance. If the word\r\n“conference” seems too official, it could be called an\r\ninternational meeting of mine-clearance experts. The\r\nobject would be to draft and adopt an international\r\nstrategy on mine clearance, as well as ways and means of\r\nalleviating the disastrous consequences of land-mines in\r\nwar-stricken countries.\r\nWith this in mind we have submitted the text of\r\namendments which my delegation proposes to the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/49/L.8. The\r\namendments address the broader activities of the Section\r\nin the Secretariat dealing with the question of mine\r\nclearance and the need for scientific research aimed at the\r\nrapid advancement of mine-clearance technology, and\r\nwould request the Secretary-General to convene, in 1995,\r\nan international meeting of experts on assistance in mine\r\nclearance, in order to promote the work of the United\r\nNations and international cooperation in this field.\r\nI therefore propose that all delegations sponsoring\r\ndraft resolution A/49/L.8 study these points and, if they\r\nagree, on the amendments there will be no need to vote\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\non them separately and they can be considered as included\r\nin the text. In that case, the delegation of Afghanistan will\r\njoin the sponsors of the draft which, at this time, we\r\nconsider insufficient.\r\nMr. Noterdaeme (Belgium) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): May I begin by wholly associating myself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Germany on behalf\r\nof the European Union, who rightly emphasized the\r\nhumanitarian aspect and urgency of assistance in mine\r\nclearance.\r\nTwo world conflicts left many regions in Belgium\r\ninfested by mines and other unexploded devices. For more\r\nthan 75 years and with an average of 3,200 interventions\r\neach year, my country has developed experience in matters\r\nof mine clearance. This know-how has been put into\r\npractice in Cambodia through the participation of a Belgian\r\nmine-clearance team working under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and in\r\ncooperation with the Cambodian mine action centre. I take\r\nthis opportunity to announce that Belgium has decided to\r\nmaintain its contribution to this type of action within the\r\nframework of the United Nations.\r\nIn addition, on the basis of Belgium’s experience I can\r\nspeak about the scope of the problem. If three quarters of\r\na century after the end of hostilities abandoned munitions\r\ncontinue to kill indiscriminately despite systematic mine-\r\nclearing actions, what will happen in countries where vast\r\nstretches of land are infested by millions of mines which\r\nhave been blindly sown?\r\nThe great merit of the Secretary-General’s report is\r\nthat it has clarified the scope and complexity of the task\r\nbefore us as well as the urgent need to coordinate\r\ninternational efforts for assistance in mine clearance. The\r\nsuccess of rescue operations, repatriation and of bringing\r\npeople back into society, as well as economic recovery, will\r\nall remain compromised until we have settled the problem\r\nof mines.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s designation of the Department\r\nof Humanitarian Affairs as a focal point for assistance in\r\nmine clearance and the establishment of the Mine Action\r\nSection are important first steps towards solving this\r\nproblem.\r\nAnother, no less important, aspect is that of the\r\nnecessary financial resources. In this regard, Belgium hails\r\nthe establishment by the Secretary-General of a voluntary\r\ntrust fund for assistance in mine clearance, to which it will\r\nbe able at this time to make a first contribution of\r\n$150,000.\r\nThere is another aspect the Secretary-General rightly\r\nmentioned in his report: the unchecked proliferation of\r\nmines and, in particular, of anti-personnel mines. At a\r\ntime when we are seeking solutions to the presence of\r\nthese devices, we note that the number of anti-personnel\r\nmines laid, often in a non-selective way, exceeds the\r\nnumber of mines which have been neutralized.\r\nInternational preventive action is therefore more than ever\r\nnecessary to limit that proliferation.\r\nIn this respect, in July 1993 the Belgian Government\r\nannounced an open-ended moratorium on the export and\r\nthe transit of anti-personnel mines. In direct\r\nimplementation of that decision, the Belgian army will\r\nbegin to destroy its surplus stocks of anti-personnel mines\r\nfollowing its restructuring. Furthermore, all mine-laying\r\nvehicles will be modified. These decisions will cost\r\nmoney, but they are the result of a clear moral choice: to\r\noutlaw all anti-personnel mines for ever.\r\nFinally, I wish to emphasize the crucial role of the\r\nconference to review the 1980 inhumane weapons\r\nConvention. Belgium is participating in the work of the\r\ngroup of experts that is preparing for that conference,\r\nwith priority being given to the review of Protocol II.\r\nBelgium is now in a position to announce that the process\r\nfor ratification of the inhumane weapons convention has\r\nbeen completed and that the instruments of ratification\r\nwill very soon be deposited at the United Nations.\r\nBelgium will therefore participate in the 1995 review\r\nconference as a State party.\r\nWhile it is true that, as Mr. Eliasson said when he\r\nwas the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian\r\nAffairs, the presence of mines in countries is a war of\r\ntime bombs, it is just as true that some countries can lose\r\nthat war if the international community does not\r\ncoordinate and intensify its efforts to help them overcome\r\ntheir tribulations.\r\nThe draft resolution before the Assembly is an\r\nimportant step in that direction. I would therefore like to\r\nconclude by expressing the hope that it will be adopted,\r\nas a similar draft resolution was last year, by consensus\r\nand with a maximum of sponsors.\r\nMrs. Vidal (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The international community has begun to be\r\naware of the tragedy that the production, proliferation,\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nand exportation of conventional weapons constitute for\r\nmankind. Wars strike at countries’ social and economic\r\ndevelopment, sidetracking them from the natural path of\r\ndevelopment and progress to which they rightly aspire in a\r\nworld where inequalities are becoming virulent and\r\nunacceptable on the eve of the twenty-first century.\r\nTherefore, exporting countries must renounce the\r\nselfishness that comes from mercantilism, forgo the fat\r\nprofits amassed at the cost of the devastation of defenceless\r\npeoples, and adopt genuinely effective measures to alleviate\r\nthe suffering of thousands of men, women and children,\r\nmainly in developing countries. These are the innocent\r\nvictims of the sale and indiscriminate use of conventional\r\nweapons, among which we must especially condemn\r\nanti-personnel mines, true “crops of death”, as they have\r\nbeen quite rightly dubbed by one of the major Colombian\r\nmedia.\r\nOur country has for a number of years been exerting\r\nefforts to make the international community aware of the\r\ndisastrous social, political and economic effects of arms\r\ntransfers — in particular, illegal arms trafficking. Colombia\r\nagrees with the following observation made by a delegate\r\nat a recent meeting of the International Committee of the\r\nRed Cross:\r\n“Mines can be described as combatants that never\r\nmiss a shot, that attack indiscriminately, that carry\r\nconcealed weapons and that victimize people long\r\nafter the cessation of hostilities. Mines are the greatest\r\nviolators of international humanitarian rights and\r\npractise an inconceivable kind of terrorism”.\r\nSupporting that quotation are the figures disclosed in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report in document A/49/357, where\r\nhe estimates that there are more than 110 million\r\nunexploded land-mines spread in 64 countries, that between\r\n2 and 5 million more are being laid each year, and that\r\nmore than 800 people per month — people who are not\r\ninvolved in any conflict — are killed or suffer permanent\r\ninjury as a result of the ever-increasing presence of mines,\r\nespecially in agricultural areas.\r\nWe therefore welcome the initiatives concerning mines\r\nthat have been moving forward in the General Assembly,\r\nboth on assistance in mine clearance and on the proposed\r\nmoratorium on the exporting of anti-personnel mines. We\r\nbelieve that the success of these initiatives will set in\r\nmotion a process that can lead to the solution of the global\r\nproblem created by international transfers of conventional\r\nweapons — in particular, by illegal trafficking in them.\r\nThe point made in the Secretary-General’s report\r\nthat mine clearance could cost between $300 and $1,000\r\nper mine gives us an idea of the enormous global cost of\r\nclearing the 110 million unexploded mines to which I\r\nhave referred earlier. And this does not include the\r\nmillions of mines being laid every year in various\r\ncountries. In this context, we believe that the total\r\nprohibition of the production, development, stockpiling,\r\nsale, exportation and use of mines in all their forms and\r\nmanifestations is the only response that we can give to\r\nthe affected peoples. We therefore consider it vital to\r\ncontinue to press at all the competent forums for their\r\nelimination.\r\nWe wish to stress that civilians in countries where\r\nthere are internal conflicts suffer horrendous wounds. This\r\nis contrary to the fundamental principles of human rights.\r\nThe ease with which mines can be obtained by the parties\r\ninvolved is one of the factors impeding a peaceful\r\nsolution to these problems. The mines leave permanent\r\nfields of death, which become a burden far too heavy for\r\nStates to bear. We are now seeing examples of this in\r\nvarious parts of our continent and others.\r\nThus, we agree with the Secretary-General’s report\r\nin document A/49/275 on a moratorium on the exporting\r\nof anti-personnel land-mines. As indicated there, a\r\nmoratorium would be easier to implement, monitor and\r\nverify, and it would guarantee more than any other\r\nmeasure that the indiscriminate killing and maiming of\r\ncivilians occurring nowadays would ultimately cease.\r\nThe human tragedy, the problems in the normal\r\ncultivation of crops in the afflicted countries, and the high\r\ncost of clearance are, among other factors, reason enough\r\nto work together to achieve the total cessation of the\r\nproduction and exportation of mines. Hence, although we\r\nsupport the initiative of the European Union, we greatly\r\nregret that it does not contain proposals for the total\r\neradication of the problem, by its roots. However, we\r\nhope that today’s discussion will contribute to laying the\r\ngroundwork for the attainment of that goal in the near\r\nfuture.\r\nWith regard to the proposal to set up a trust fund for\r\nthe clearance of mines, we believe that the countries\r\nproducing and exporting mines, as well as those that are\r\nparties to conflict, must shoulder a special responsibility\r\nfor participating in an activity that harms the physical\r\nhealth and the social and economic well-being of peoples\r\nand constitutes a crime against mankind.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nWe support the efforts being made at various forums\r\nto find a definitive solution to mine-related problems and,\r\nin general, to illicit trafficking in arms. Our purpose here\r\nmust absolutely be to ensure that our commitments alleviate\r\nthe suffering of the peoples affected and defend their right\r\nto life and to economic and social progress.\r\nMr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): New Zealand\r\nwishes to compliment the Secretary-General on his\r\nexcellent report on the humanitarian problem posed by\r\nmines and on this Organization’s vital role in confronting\r\nit. The report is noteworthy for its comprehensive account\r\nof the scale of the problem. The rate of proliferation of\r\nthese weapons, their awful toll on civilians and the yawning\r\ngap between mine-laying and mine-clearance rates make\r\nimperative the efforts by the international community to\r\nrestrict the availability of mines. New Zealand hopes that\r\nthe opportunity will be taken in next year’s review of the\r\ninhumane weapons Convention to strengthen the provisions\r\nrelating to mines and that more Members than the current\r\n40 will become parties to the Convention.\r\nIn addition, we were most interested in the comments\r\nmade by President Clinton in his address to the General\r\nAssembly last month about proposals for the elimination of\r\nthe world’s 85 million anti-personnel land-mines. We look\r\nforward to working with the United States delegation in the\r\nelaboration of that proposal in the First Committee.\r\nNew Zealand has a solid record of support for this\r\nOrganization’s efforts in mine clearance. Over the past five\r\nyears, we have made available specialist personnel for\r\nUnited Nations de-mining programmes in Afghanistan,\r\nCambodia and Mozambique. We continue to participate in\r\nthe work of the Cambodian Mine-Action Centre and to\r\ncontribute financially towards its costs. In Mozambique, at\r\nthe United Nations request, we have made available a\r\nsenior military officer who took up the position of Deputy\r\nDirector for De-mining in August this year in an effort to\r\nget that de-mining programme back on track. We have also\r\nprovided eight de-mining instructors for the programme.\r\nThe Secretary-General has commented in his report\r\nupon the rapid expansion since 1988 in the demands upon\r\nthe United Nations to provide assistance in mine clearance.\r\nWe appreciate that the Organization has had to strive hard\r\nto keep pace. There is no concealing the fact that it\r\nstumbled in Mozambique, as reported by the Security\r\nCouncil mission which visited that country. On the other\r\nhand, it is encouraging that steps have been taken to\r\nremedy that situation. In this regard, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations for strengthening coordination\r\nwithin the Organization are most timely.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report acknowledges that\r\nthere is a need to improve the effectiveness of United\r\nNations assistance. It emphasizes most appropriately the\r\nneed for the centralized compilation of lessons learned.\r\nWe believe that the recommended allocation of primary\r\nresponsibility for the mine-clearance field programme and\r\nheadquarters support to the Department of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs is sensible. We strongly support the creation of a\r\nnew mine action section in the Department and the\r\nprovision of the necessary staff positions through\r\nappropriate adjustments. New Zealand would also be\r\nprepared to consider contributing to the Department’s\r\nproposed stand-by capacities, such as the short-term\r\nassignment of instructors or other personnel.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s recommendations on the\r\ncreation of a national capacity for mine clearing are also\r\nimportant. My delegation considers that the Cambodian\r\nMine-Action Centre provides a useful model in this\r\nregard. From the experience of New Zealand personnel\r\nwho have participated in mine-clearance programmes, we\r\nare convinced that local involvement, local management\r\nand a local stake in mine-clearance operations are basic\r\nand essential. In our view local, participation should begin\r\nas early as possible in the process with a view to\r\nencouraging local ownership of the programme and local\r\ninitiative.\r\nThe va luab le con t r ibu t ion made by\r\nnon-governmental organizations in mine clearance should\r\nalso be recognized. A timely approach to readying these\r\norganizations for operations could obviate the need for\r\ncontractors in many instances. Improved liaison with\r\nnon-governmental organizations will have benefits. Recent\r\noperations have demonstrated that there is considerable\r\nmilitary expertise available in de-mining, including\r\nexpertise in providing instruction. This expertise could be\r\nchannelled into assistance to non-governmental\r\norganizations to help them form their own de-mining\r\ntraining and supervisory teams should they wish to\r\nparticipate in this way. We believe that a significant\r\nmultiplier effect in terms of generating trained personnel\r\nand freeing up capacity for stand-by contributions could\r\nbe gained as a result.\r\nFinally, my delegation looks forward to the adoption\r\nof the draft resolution on this item. We are pleased to be\r\na sponsor.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nMr. Castaneda Cornejo (El Salvador) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I have the honour of speaking on behalf of\r\nthe Central American countries — Costa Rica, Guatemala,\r\nHonduras, Nicaragua, Panama and El Salvador — on\r\nagenda item 22, entitled “Assistance in mine clearance”.\r\nAt the outset, I should like to reiterate on behalf of\r\nour delegations our sincere congratulations on the\r\noutstanding way in which Mr. Essy is guiding the work of\r\nthis session. We have no doubt that in the end we will have\r\nmade important strides on the difficult road towards\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nOn the issue before us, our subregion deems it of\r\nparticular importance, given the painful and tragic\r\nexperience our own countries have endured from the\r\nharmful and continued impact of land-mines and other\r\nunexploded devices planted in various areas throughout\r\nCentral America as a result of armed conflicts. This\r\nposition, underscored by our co-sponsorship in 1993 of\r\nresolution 48/7, introduced at the initiative of the members\r\nof the European Union, on assistance in mine clearance. In\r\nthat resolution, the serious problems caused by mines sown\r\nin various regions and the responsibility of States to\r\ncontribute to their clearance are recognized.\r\nFor Central America, the importance of the issue is\r\nnot confined to the situation in our subregion alone, but\r\nextends to the situation in other regions, where the gravity\r\nand magnitude of the problem have dimensions that may be\r\ntermed catastrophic. In this context, the initiative of\r\nintroducing the item on the General Assembly’s agenda and\r\nof considering the problem in depth at the global level in an\r\neffort to find better forms of coordinating our work and\r\nadopting measures to come to grips effectively with this\r\nissue — which has been described as an affront to all\r\nhumanity — deserved and deserves our full support.\r\nWe have read with interest the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport (A/49/357 and Add.1). We wish to express our\r\nthanks and appreciation for its breadth and depth, which\r\nreflect the nature and extent of the problem of land-mines\r\nand other explosive devices buried during armed conflicts,\r\nboth domestic and international. It also portrays the tragedy\r\nof people who have suffered the effects or the potential\r\ninnocent victims of these devices and, in general, their\r\nnegative impact on society as a whole.\r\nThe human tragedy resulting from the existence of\r\nmine fields and their dimensions and impact on the life of\r\na nation are bluntly reflected in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. In the words of the report, men, women and\r\nchildren who survive the explosion of the mine\r\n“often lose at least one limb and often suffer\r\nadditional muscular damage, damage to internal\r\norgans, blindness and the loss of testes...”.\r\n(A/49/357, para.4)\r\nIt is alarming that land-mines have killed or seriously\r\ninjured over one million men, women and children over\r\nthe past 20 years, most of them civilians. This prompts\r\nthe conclusion that the real or potential threat of land-\r\nmines has become a global humanitarian problem that is\r\neven more difficult and tragic in developing countries that\r\ndo not have the resources to implement full-scale\r\nprogrammes to reintegrate the injured into society.\r\nAbove and beyond constituting a threat to the life\r\nand integrity of persons, the existence of mine fields has\r\nan adverse impact in economic and social terms,\r\nincluding obstacles to the return of refugees and displaced\r\npersons to their homes. This further impedes the process\r\nof reintegrating the injured into society, hamstrings the\r\nprovision of basic services, and represents a serious\r\nobstacle in the way of economic development, particularly\r\nof activities aimed at rebuilding a country and\r\nhumanitarian cooperation and peace-building activities\r\nundertaken by the United Nations in post-war periods.\r\nThe problem of mines and their impact on Central\r\nAmerican society were addressed in the statement made\r\nby the Republic of Panama before the First Committee\r\nduring the debate on the items relating to disarmament\r\nand international security. This statement dramatically\r\nhighlighted the consequences of the explosion of such\r\nweapons, which bring death, injury and mutilation to\r\ncivilians and particularly to innocent children and take a\r\nhigh human and economic toll. It stressed the price paid\r\nby Central Americans during the period of armed clashes\r\nas a focal point of the so-called cold war and a profitable\r\nmarket for the sale of mines.\r\nThe Organization of American States has established\r\na mine-clearance programme for Central America. By its\r\nresolution AG/1191 (XXII-1992), it also established a\r\nfund for contributions and pledges for countries wishing\r\nto cooperate in mine clearance. The process has made\r\nconsiderable strides with the assistance of our regional\r\norganization, the support of the Association for\r\nDemocracy and Development, the Inter-American Defense\r\nBoard and the cooperation of a number of donor States,\r\nmembers of the international community.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nAgainst this backdrop, we welcome the fact that El\r\nSalvador has been able to declare the work of mine\r\nclearance ended, thanks not only to international assistance,\r\nbut in large measure also thanks to the efforts and financing\r\nprovided by the Government of El Salvador and the\r\ncooperation established between our Government, the\r\npolitical party Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación\r\nNacionál and the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nEl Salvador.\r\nIt should also be mentioned that the Government of\r\nHonduras has announced the initiation of a programme to\r\nclear mines placed during the past decade on the borders\r\nbetween Honduras and Nicaragua and between Honduras\r\nand El Salvador. The first phase, which will begin in the\r\nprovinces of Olancho and El Paraíso, bordering on\r\nNicaragua, will involve the cooperation of nationals of\r\nGuatemala, Brazil, Colombia and Honduras, who will be\r\ntrained by United States experts in mine clearance. This\r\nprogramme, we learn unofficially, will be under the\r\nauspices of the regional organization, the OAS, which will\r\ninvest $1.5 million to remove almost 150,000 mines.\r\nDespite these efforts, the Secretary General of the\r\nOAS has stated that to reactivate the process of mine\r\nclearance in Central America, the special fund will require\r\nsome $3,200,000 by the end of this year. This could cover\r\nacceleration of the mine clearance programme in\r\nNicaragua, with the cooperation of the OAS and friendly\r\ncountries, and, in the near future, involve de-mining\r\nactivities along the Costa Rica-Nicaragua border and\r\npossibly in Guatemala, where the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees set in train in April this year a\r\nrisk-reduction and training programme in the area where\r\nrefugees are to be relocated.\r\nWe wish to emphasize that we Central Americans are\r\ndeeply concerned at the gravity of the problem of\r\nminefields, whose proliferation and indiscriminate effects\r\nare an obstacle to the economic and social development of\r\nour region. The consequences of the problem of mines,\r\ndescribed in detail in the report of the Secretary-General,\r\n“An Agenda for Development”, deserve greater attention\r\nand the resolve of the entire international community to\r\neliminate them.\r\nFaced with the need to strengthen and implement\r\nmine-clearance programmes, we exhort the members of the\r\ndonor community to be generous in providing the necessary\r\nresources, particularly if they are convinced and understand\r\nthat the problem has a human dimension, which is why\r\ninternational cooperation takes on a fundamentally human\r\nconnotation.\r\nBearing in mind the experience Central America has\r\ngained in mine clearance, we think it important to make\r\nthe following comments.\r\nIt is vital to have the assistance and full cooperation\r\nof all national sectors, and particularly of those parties\r\ndirectly involved in a conflict, to move along the process\r\nof mine clearance.\r\nNon-governmental organizations, international\r\nagencies and private enterprises - particularly those with\r\nexperience in mine clearance - should be invited to\r\nparticipate in such programmes.\r\nWe think there must be established, with the\r\nassistance of the relevant specialized body within the\r\nUnited Nations system, educational programmes to make\r\npeople aware of the problem of mines. I am thinking\r\nparticularly of children and of the inhabitants of rural\r\nareas who could be affected by the laying of mines.\r\nIt is necessary to promote among the parties directly\r\ninvolved in any conflict, a greater respect for\r\nhumanitarian law, and in this instance to promote\r\nmapping of minefields, making it possible to locate mines\r\nin the post-conflict period, and facilitate clearance.\r\nWe are convinced that the problem of mines is not\r\nsolely a matter of a lack of humanitarian ethics among the\r\nparties to any conflict. Rather, and perhaps to a greater\r\ndegree, it concerns the ethics of those who produce and\r\nmarket them, particularly when they introduce more\r\nadvanced technology, making mine-detection more\r\ndifficult, while showing no interest in technological\r\nprogress to make mine-detection easier in the post-conflict\r\nperiod.\r\nWe share the thinking of the Secretary-General,\r\nexpressed in his report that I have mentioned, about the\r\nneed to strengthen the capacity and coordination of the\r\nspecialized bodies of the United Nations system, under\r\nthe general responsibility of the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, to ensure a coherent, sustained and\r\nwide-ranging approach to the problem until it has been\r\ncompletely eliminated.\r\nBearing in mind financial limitations in Central\r\nAmerica, we support the establishment of a voluntary\r\ntrust fund, which we believe will, given its humanitarian\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nnature, enjoy the support of the international community\r\nand in particular the industrialized countries, so that we\r\nmay have the resources required to speed up progress in\r\ndealing with the serious problem of mine clearance. It is\r\ntherefore important to stress that the situation in the world\r\nwill worsen by the day, becoming more frustrating and\r\ndiscouraging, if we do not get new and additional resources\r\nfor that purpose. As the Secretary-General’s report points\r\nout:\r\n\"If the proliferation of land-mines were stopped in\r\n1996, at current rates of funding and clearance it\r\nwould still take almost 1,100 years to rid the world of\r\nthe land-mines now in the ground.\" (A/49/357,\r\npara. 66)\r\nWe in the Central American countries fully support\r\nthose countries that have already said the voluntary trust\r\nfund should be financed mainly by the countries that\r\nproduce and export mines and by voluntary contributions by\r\nMember States.\r\nOn the basis of the experience gained in Central\r\nAmerica, we do unhesitatingly recommend using regional\r\norganizations for mine clearance, an area in which we\r\nmight strengthen ties of cooperation, although we feel that\r\nthere must be close coordination with the world\r\nOrganization as well.\r\nI should like to put forward some additional\r\nrecommendations that we consider might, in the short,\r\nmedium and long term, help solve the problem of mines.\r\nDuring post-conflict periods humanitarian activities\r\ninvolved in United Nations peace-keeping and peace-\r\nbuilding efforts should include mine-clearance programmes.\r\nAs a first step, we support the suspension of the\r\nexport of anti-personnel land-mines; which pose an\r\nexcessive threat to the civilian population, this measure\r\nmight stem the rapid growth and proliferation worldwide of\r\nthe problem of mines.We consider that the suspension\r\nshould go beyond a limited moratorium on anti-personnel\r\nmines to cover suspension of production and export and to\r\nintroduce transparency into the acquisition of such mines\r\nand ancillary devices, leading to agreements that could\r\nresult in the adoption of measures to end the use and\r\nproliferation of land-mines the world over.\r\nMindful of our humanitarian responsibility, the\r\ncountries of Central America therefore call on countries that\r\nmanufacture and export mines and transfer the technology\r\nfor their production to declare a moratorium on those\r\nactivities. This would make a substantial contribution to\r\nthe attainment of the goals set out in the draft resolution\r\nbefore the Assembly. We appreciate the unilateral steps\r\ntaken by Spain and by Italy, and hope that they will\r\nmotivate other mine-producing countries to take similar\r\naction. In that connection, Central America would warmly\r\nwelcome the inclusion in draft resolution A/49/L.8 of the\r\namendment proposed by Honduras in document A/49/L.11\r\non the proclamation of a moratorium on the sale, export\r\nor any other transfer of anti-personnel mines until a new\r\ninternational regime regulating their import and\r\nproduction can be achieved. That provision would\r\ncomplement the First Committee’s draft resolution the\r\nFirst Committee specifically on the export of\r\nanti-personnel mines.\r\nWe support the convening of an international review\r\nconference to amend the Convention on Prohibitions or\r\nRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons\r\nWhich May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to\r\nHave Indiscriminate Effects and, in particular, its Protocol\r\nII on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines,\r\nBooby-Traps and Other Devices.\r\nWe want the group of governmental experts\r\nestablished pursuant to resolution 48/79 to prepare the\r\nConvention review conference to be able as soon as\r\npossible to consider restrictions on the use of land-mines\r\nin internal conflicts, so as to make the Protocol broader\r\nand more effective in combating the proliferation and use\r\nof land-mines.\r\nApart from any progress in the adoption of\r\nmeasures and stipulations to regulate the matter of mines,\r\nwe consider it important to set a code of conduct for the\r\ntransfer of mines, especially for States that have not\r\nacceded to the Convention and its Protocol II, as\r\nproposed by the United Kingdom.\r\nBearing in mind that the problem of mines stems\r\nfrom the existence of internal and international armed\r\nconflicts and that most of these are in turn the result of\r\nfactors touching on the economic and social structure of\r\ncountries or of political, economic, strategic and territorial\r\ndisputes between States, we believe that at this stage of\r\nhuman development we should be more rational in our\r\napproach to world problems and international affairs.\r\nOn the domestic level, Governments — especially\r\nthose of developing countries, where most conflict\r\nsituations arise — should promote programmes for\r\neconomic and social development that will address the\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nroot causes of despair, social tension and ultimately armed\r\nconflict. Internationally, Governments should encourage\r\ngreater use of machinery for the peaceful settlement of\r\nconflicts, especially dialogue, direct negotiation and resort\r\nto international collective-security machinery, which would\r\navoid confrontation and war between States.\r\nIf this proved possible, it would be a preventive\r\nmeasure that would avoid the quantitative and qualitative\r\ngrowth of the problem of mines, and would accord with the\r\npurposes of the Charter and the Secretary-General’s “An\r\nAgenda for Peace” by implementing preventive measures\r\nfor the maintenance of peace.\r\nIn conclusion, the countries of Central America\r\nreiterate our concern at the growing world-wide problem of\r\nmines, and especially at the human suffering it causes and\r\nthe high social costs of the detonation of these devices. We\r\nfully support measures for the ultimate eradication of these\r\nconcealed killers; we therefore support the draft resolution\r\nbefore the Assembly and are among its sponsors.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran): Last year,\r\nby adopting resolution 48/7 under the agenda item entitled\r\n“Assistance in mine clearance”, the Assembly recognized\r\nthe tremendous threat posed to human life by the millions\r\nof land-mines laid in a large number of countries. Owing to\r\ntheir lethal nature and collateral effects, land-mines cause\r\nuntold suffering and misery to innocent civilians, including\r\nwomen and children. Moreover, land-mines invariably\r\ndisrupt post-conflict social- and economic-development\r\nprogrammes in infested States. Indeed, the proliferation and\r\nlaying of land-mines without reference to legitimate defence\r\nrequirements sow the seeds of multifaceted agony and\r\ntragedy, ranging from an increased number of civilian\r\ncasualties to ever-widening disruption of development\r\nprogrammes in infested States. Yet it is unfortunate to note\r\nthat, in spite of this humanitarian disaster, the laying of\r\nland-mines continues unabated; as observed by the\r\nSecretary-General, 2 million more land-mines are being laid\r\nannually world wide.\r\nMy delegation noted with appreciation the\r\ncomprehensive report of the Secretary-General on assistance\r\nin mine clearance, contained in document A/49/357.\r\nAlthough the report does not contain all-inclusive\r\ninformation about all mine-contaminated territories,\r\nincluding that of my country, it encompasses a meaningful\r\nexamination of the global land-mine crisis and sets out\r\nworkable recommendations and plans by whose\r\nimplementing the issue at hand could, to a large extent, be\r\naddressed and its ensuing miseries alleviated.\r\nThe situation we are facing today as a result of land-\r\nmine use is a disastrous one. As observed by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report, the rapid proliferation of\r\nmines, together with the old-fashioned technology used in\r\nmine detection and clearance and the ever-increasing\r\nnumber of land-mines being laid annually worldwide,\r\nmake the efforts of international community to address\r\nthe global mine crisis a difficult and necessarily\r\npainstaking one.\r\nMy country has had bitter experience in this regard.\r\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war, nearly 16 million land-mines\r\nand unexploded sub-munitions were laid in my country,\r\nwith a coverage of more than 4,000,300 hectares. Over\r\nthe past five years we have succeeded in neutralizing and\r\ndestroying 6 million mines without any access to\r\ndocumentation. However, it needs to be stressed that the\r\nmines laid in our once-occupied territories have taken\r\nhuge expanses of our agricultural land out of production\r\nand rendered them unhabitable. More important, every\r\nnow and then innocent civilians living in those regions\r\nare killed, injured or maimed, which places a significant\r\nburden upon our society.\r\nBased on our experience, I wish to stress that the\r\nmagnitude of the task facing international community in\r\nthe area of mine clearance makes strengthening of\r\ninternational cooperation in this regard all the more\r\nessential. According to the Secretary- General’s report,\r\none of the unique characteristics of the land-mine problem\r\nis that very few of the States in which conflicts have\r\nresulted in land-mine contamination produce land-mines\r\nthemselves and that more than 85 per cent of all\r\nuncleared land-mines in those States were purchased or\r\ntransferred from roughly 40 mine-producing States.\r\nHence, there is a need for concerted efforts by the\r\ninternational community to rid the world of this plague.\r\nAt the same time, the responsibility of those States that\r\nhave laid mines in foreign territories in providing\r\neffective assistance and information, including maps and\r\ndocumentation of land-mines to the infested States, cannot\r\nbe overlooked.\r\nMy delegation supports the proposal of the\r\nSecretary-General to establish a voluntary fund for\r\nassistance in mine clearance. Moreover, we view the\r\nestablishment of a central database for the collection of\r\nglobal data on the land-mine problem in the Department\r\nof Humanitarian Affairs as a step in the right direction.\r\nWe believe that all countries, and particularly those that\r\nhave laid mines in foreign territories, must shoulder their\r\nresponsibilities to provide this newly established\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nmechanism with all necessary information with a view to\r\naccelerating national and international endeavours in the\r\narea of mine clearance.\r\nMr. Azwai (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): I should like, at the outset, to inform the\r\ninternational community, through the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly that the 26th of October is a day of\r\nmourning in my country. On 26 October, 1911, my country\r\nwas the victim of a colonialist invasion by Italy, during\r\nwhich Italy incarcerated thousands of Libyans in\r\nconcentration camps prior to sending them into exile on\r\nItalian uninhabited islands where most of them perished\r\nfrom hunger and disease. The problem of those exiles is\r\none of the most important issues still pending between my\r\ncountry and Italy, in addition to the question of mines.\r\nThe magnitude and gravity of the problems caused by\r\nmines left in the soil of many countries are such that their\r\neffects cannot be dealt with effectively without stronger\r\nparticipation by the United Nations, which should also\r\ncoordinate international activities in this area. It was on this\r\nbasis that my country’s delegation welcomed the inclusion\r\nin the agenda of the last session of the General Assembly\r\nof an item entitled “Assistance in mine clearance.“ We\r\nalso supported resolution 48/7, adopted at that session, in\r\nthe hope that that resolution and any other additional\r\nmeasures that may be taken in the future would give an\r\nimpetus to the endeavours of the international community\r\nto address the mines problem, including the urgent\r\nimplementation of the provisions of earlier resolutions\r\nwherein the General Assembly recognized the threats that\r\nsuch mines pose to the lives of individuals and their\r\nextremely harmful economic and social effects that arise\r\nfrom the fact that mines and other unexploded devices\r\nmake it difficult for individuals to move about in safety,\r\nhamper the expansion of land reclamation activities and\r\ndeprive the areas where they are laid of social advancement\r\nand economic development.\r\nMy delegation’s concern over the problem of mines\r\nstems from an early awareness of the threats that those\r\ndevices pose to man and nature alike. My country was the\r\nfirst to draw attention to the problem. Now that the world\r\nhas come to understand our concern, the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya is gratified by the increased international\r\nsolidarity aimed at dealing with the mines problem. In\r\naddition, our deep concern over the question is due to the\r\nfact that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is one of the countries\r\nthat still face this serious problem, since Libya was a\r\ntheatre of military operations during the Second World\r\nWar, at which time the combatants laid millions of mines\r\nin its soil, along its coastline and in its territorial waters.\r\nWhen the belligerents departed, they left behind vast\r\nminefields and booby trapped areas which they did not\r\ncare to clear, and have shown no readiness to help in\r\nclearing even through the provision of the maps needed\r\nfor such clearance. Those mines are estimated to be in the\r\nmillions as confirmed by a study prepared by a group of\r\nhigh-level United Nations experts and published in\r\ndocument A/38/383. That study stated that:\r\n“in the various North African campaigns during the\r\nSecond World War, for example, the Allied and the\r\nAxis forces laid many millions of such devices,\r\nmostly anti-tank mines. The estimates vary from\r\nsome 5 million to as many as 19 million, according\r\nto different sources.” (A/38/383, annex, para. 7)\r\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has suffered great\r\nlosses as a result of the explosion of mines. There are no\r\naccurate or definitive estimates as to the size of those\r\nlosses. However, a preliminary study prepared by\r\nspecialized experts, whose statistics were included in our\r\nresponse to General Assembly resolution 48/7, estimated\r\nthe number of dead at 5,670 and of those permanently\r\ninjured at 4,935. Moreover, the mines killed 11,900\r\nanimals. Those estimates coincide with estimates in a\r\nstudy that has been published recently in a wide-\r\ncirculation newspaper, which stated that:\r\n“the mines buried in Libya since the Second World\r\nWar have, through 1983, killed 4,000 persons and\r\n12,000 animals.”\r\nFurthermore, the presence of the mines in Libya’s soil has\r\nimpeded efforts aimed at implementing development plans\r\nand the expansion of land reclamation, as is confirmed in\r\na recent study, which states that:\r\n“27 per cent of Libya’s arable land is unusable\r\nbecause of the mines planted in it during the Second\r\nWorld War.”\r\nOver the years, the General Assembly has adopted\r\nmany resolutions on war debris. These include resolutions\r\n35/71, 36/188, 37/215, 38/162 and 39/167. All those\r\nresolutions have recognized the fact that clearance of war\r\ndebris, including mines, is the responsibility of the\r\ncountries that placed them and that such countries should\r\nprovide adequate information and technical assistance\r\ntowards their clearance, pay compensation for the losses\r\nand damage caused by them and pay for their removal\r\nand destruction. My country’s delegation would like to\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\ntake this opportunity to renew its support for those\r\nresolutions and to urge the General Assembly to take all\r\nnecessary measures for their implementation. At the same\r\ntime, my country’s delegation believes that the General\r\nAssembly should determine the ways and means whereby\r\nwe may achieve better international cooperation in\r\nremoving and destroying mines, both old and new, because\r\nthe continued presence of old mines is dangerous to human\r\nlife and poses other dangers that are no less severe than\r\nthose of more recent ones.\r\nMy country’s delegation has studied the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report in document A/49/357. It is noteworthy\r\nthat the report focused on special instances of the mines\r\nproblem and, in particular, those resulting from internal\r\nconflicts over the past 20 years and their consequences. The\r\nreport, however, does not mention the mines planted a long\r\ntime ago, as in the case of those in my country’s soil,\r\nwhich were planted over 50 years ago and which continue\r\nto cause the same suffering and wreak the same damage.\r\nNone the less, the proposals contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report to this session are welcomed by\r\nmy country’s delegation. We consider that the success of\r\nthe United Nations system in translating those proposals\r\ninto reality will depend on the cooperation of Member\r\nStates in providing training, financial assistance and\r\ntechnical expertise to the affected countries, especially those\r\nwhich lack the necessary means and capabilities. This\r\nincludes my country, which lacks the necessary expertise to\r\nclear the minefields planted in its territory during the\r\nSecond World War.\r\nBecause the mines are spread over a wide area and are\r\nof different types, our capabilities for removing them are\r\nlimited. Added to this is the lack of maps and documents\r\nidentifying the location of minefields, which still constitute,\r\non the one hand, a source of grave danger to human and\r\nanimal life and, on the other, a central impediment to the\r\nimplementation of economic and social development plans.\r\nThe Libyan people, who have suffered and continue to\r\nsuffer because of a war that was fought on their soil and\r\nthat brought down upon them a great deal of destruction\r\nand pain and many deaths and disabilities, look to the\r\nUnited Nations system to provide them with direct\r\nassistance to remove those mines and to support their\r\nrequests to the countries that planted the mines to provide\r\nthe relevant information, reports, assistance and technical\r\nexpertise for that purpose.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to say that we have noted\r\nthat the draft resolution contained in document A/49/L.8\r\ncontains many positive elements. It does not, however,\r\nreflect some important concerns which we consider to be\r\nimportant. For this reason, my country’s delegation spoke\r\nto the delegation of Germany which proposed to\r\namendments that we hope will be accepted by the\r\nsponsors of the draft resolution so that it may be adopted\r\nby consensus.\r\nMr. Marrero (United States of America): Despite\r\nthe efforts of the United States and other countries, the\r\nglobal anti-personnel land-mine problem is getting worse.\r\nThe simple fact is that more land-mines are deployed in\r\narmed conflicts every year than are removed by mine-\r\nclearance personnel. Some 64 countries are now littered\r\nwith an estimated 85 million to 110 million anti-personnel\r\nland-mines; 65 million, or approximately two thirds of\r\nthese, have been laid since 1978. Tragically,\r\nanti-personnel land-mines maim or kill hundreds of\r\ninnocent civilians every week.\r\nThe burden imposed by the proliferation and\r\nindiscriminate use of these weapons is beyond calculation.\r\nThe world must take stronger steps to address this\r\nproblem, and the United States intends to remain at the\r\nforefront of that effort.\r\nThe United States has long been involved in efforts\r\nto assist countries plagued with active, deployed land-\r\nmines left behind after the termination of a war. We\r\nsupport de-mining efforts in Afghanistan, Cambodia and\r\nMozambique, where we have worked closely with the\r\nUnited Nations. We are also supporting de-mining efforts\r\nin Eritrea, Ethiopia, Namibia, Nicaragua, Honduras and\r\nCosta Rica. Significant land-mine problems also exist in\r\nAngola, Somalia, Liberia and Bosnia, but unrest in those\r\ncountries has prevented the implementation of United\r\nStates assistance.\r\nIn the last several years, the nature of the land-mine\r\nproblem has changed dramatically. Some belligerents,\r\nespecially in civil conflicts, began using land-mines\r\nindiscriminately as offensive weapons. Some also\r\ndeployed long-lived mines in vast numbers, using new\r\nremote delivery systems. The total number of deployed\r\nland-mines jumped from many thousands to tens of\r\nmillions. In short, the objective characteristics of the land-\r\nmine problem changed in fundamental ways.\r\nLand-mines are a weapon of choice for many\r\nGovernment and insurgent groups. They are cheap, easy\r\nto manufacture and use, difficult to detect and expensive\r\nand dangerous to remove. Land-mines are easily exploited\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 25 October 1994\r\nby adversary groups and sometimes are used as weapons of\r\nterror against civilian populations to generate fear, inhibit\r\nrefugee repatriation, disrupt economic reconstruction and\r\ngenerally create chaos in fragile Governments.\r\nIt is all too common that combatants do not remove\r\nland-mines after a conflict ends. They are left for\r\npopulations — and, more recently, peace-keepers — to deal\r\nwith. Although international law requires records of\r\nminefields to be kept and measures to protect civilians to\r\nbe taken, this is rarely done.\r\nAddressing the horrible toll in innocent civilian\r\ncasualties caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use\r\nof anti-personnel mines is a high priority of the Clinton\r\nAdministration. Last month, in his speech before the United\r\nNations, President Clinton proposed a first step towards the\r\neventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines. He\r\nproposed the negotiation of an anti-personnel-land-mine-\r\ncontrol regime. This regime would restrict exports,\r\nproduction and stockpiles of anti-personnel land-mines.\r\nWhile we recognize that anti-personnel land-mines are\r\na legitimate weapon of war when used in accordance with\r\nthe laws of armed conflict, we recognize also that their\r\nproliferation, coupled with widespread indiscriminate and\r\nirresponsible use, causes unnecessary human suffering.\r\nRidding the world of these hidden killers would help save\r\nthe lives of tens of thousands of men, women and innocent\r\nchildren in the years to come. Our ultimate goal is the\r\neventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines. We can\r\nmove most effectively towards this goal as viable and\r\nhumane alternatives are developed. We know this will take\r\ntime.\r\nIn the interim, we are also seeking to strengthen\r\nProtocol II of the Convention on conventional weapons.\r\nThe United States is pressing for substantial improvements\r\nto the land-mine Protocol, such as making it applicable to\r\ninternal conflicts, requiring all mines to have a substantial\r\nmetallic content to facilitate post-conflict detection,\r\nrequiring that unmarked and unmonitored minefields\r\nemploy only self-destructing/self-deactivating mines and\r\nestablishing effective verification procedures.\r\nIn addition to these initiatives, we continue to call on\r\nall States to adopt moratoriums on the export of\r\nanti-personnel land-mines until a more permanent regime\r\ncan be put in place. In October 1992 the United States\r\nadopted a unilateral export moratorium on anti-personnel\r\nland-mines. This moratorium was extended in 1993 for\r\nthree years. I am pleased to note that in December 1993 the\r\nGeneral Assembly unanimously adopted a United States-\r\nsponsored resolution, similar to our current draft\r\nresolution, calling for moratoriums on exports of land-\r\nmines that pose grave dangers to civilians. To date, 17\r\ncountries have adopted moratoriums on the export of anti-\r\npersonnel land-mines. Three others have export controls\r\nwhich serve as the equivalent of an export moratorium.\r\nThis draft resolution on assistance in land-mine\r\nclearance is clearly complementary to United States\r\ninitiatives. Urgent and comprehensive action is necessary\r\nto address this tragic humanitarian problem. If our goal is\r\nto reduce innocent civilian casualties caused by\r\nanti-personnel land-mines, we must address both land-\r\nmines already emplaced and future controls on these\r\nweapons.\r\nMine-clearance assistance programmes are urgently\r\nneeded to clean up this deadly debris of war, which is\r\nperhaps the world’s most lethal form of pollution.\r\nSimultaneously, we must reverse the patterns of\r\nproliferation and indiscriminate use that are causing this\r\nhorrible problem.\r\nI applaud the United Nations for its action, and I am\r\npleased to announce that the United States, as an original\r\nco-sponsor, fully supports this draft resolution on\r\nassistance in mine clearance.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform delegations\r\nthat the Assembly will take up agenda item 11, “Report\r\nof the Security Council”, on Monday, 31 October 1994,\r\nin the afternoon instead of tomorrow, 26 October 1994, as\r\noriginally scheduled.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.\r\n28\r\n"
