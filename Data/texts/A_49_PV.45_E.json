(Côte D’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 24\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/49/398 and\r\nAdd.l)\r\nDraft resolution (A/49/L.9)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call on\r\nthe representative of Cuba to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.9.\r\nMr. Remírez de Estenoz (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): This is the third session at which the General\r\nAssembly has had to consider an item that constitutes one\r\nof the most obvious remnants of the cold-war period. For\r\nthe second consecutive year the Government of the United\r\nStates has failed to comply with the will of the international\r\ncommunity expressed in two resolutions of this the\r\nprincipal organ of the United Nations.\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial blockade\r\ncarried out by the United States against Cuba has not been\r\nreduced in any way; on the contrary it has been\r\nstrengthened. That Government has not even attempted to\r\nmoderate the extraterritorial reach of the blockade but has,\r\nby its actions, ignored the request of the General Assembly\r\nand the international community including the opinion of\r\never-wider sections of society in North America itself.\r\nToday the United States not only maintains the\r\ncomplex system of laws and regulations that comprise its\r\naggressive policy against Cuba, which my delegation has\r\nplaced before Member States on previous occasions, but\r\nduring the time that has elapsed the Government of the\r\nUnited States has continued to enact measures and\r\nprovisions geared to strengthening the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial siege against my country.\r\nAt the same time, it has continued to carry out a\r\nseries of political and diplomatic actions as well as covert\r\nactions aimed at bringing pressure to bear on independent\r\nGovernments to prevent the establishment of links with\r\nCuba in violation of internationally recognized norms,\r\nincluding those of the United States Government itself.\r\nCuba’s response, which is contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, presents an abundance of examples\r\ndemonstrating what I have said.\r\nAs part and parcel of its determination to render the\r\nsituation of the Cuban people even more difficult, and\r\nperhaps in the futile hope of stimulating violent actions\r\nthat would justify a response of another kind, as recently\r\nas 20 August this year the President of the United States\r\nannounced new regulations designed to make the\r\nconditions of the blockade even more severe.\r\nThose regulations intensify the broadcasting\r\naggression against Cuba; they prohibit remittances of\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nmoney to Cuba by Cuban-American citizens and residents\r\nin the United States; they significantly limit the sending to\r\nCuba of parcels and air cargo, consisting mainly of\r\nfoodstuffs, medicines and products to meet essential needs;\r\nand they provide for an arbitrary and severe decrease in\r\ntravel and exchanges between Cuba and the United States,\r\nmainly affecting Cuban citizens and the Cuban-American\r\ncommunity, including a drastic reduction in family visits\r\nbetween the two countries.\r\nAfter the adoption of these new regulations the United\r\nStates Department of the Treasury recognized that these\r\nmeasures were addressed to strengthen even more the\r\nembargo against Cuba and thus to limit the capacity of the\r\nCuban Government to accumulate foreign exchange.\r\nMoreover, these actions constitute an enormous\r\npolitical paradox as they are designed to create obstacles to\r\nthe process, initiated by the Cuban Government, of\r\npromoting normal relations and family reunification,\r\nbringing together Cuban emigrants - throughout the world,\r\nbut especially in the United States - and their country of\r\norigin.\r\nThat process has the broad support of all of the Cuban\r\npeople, including Cubans residing abroad. Those provisions\r\nmake Cuba the only country whose nationals in the United\r\nStates are prevented by law from maintaining normal\r\nrelations with their country.\r\nFurthermore, the interpretation adopted by the\r\nTreasury Department early in 1994 constitutes a widening\r\nof the restrictions that already existed in what it prohibits\r\nUnited States citizens from assisting or facilitating\r\noperations related to Cuba by companies in third countries.\r\nIn accordance with this interpretation, not a single United\r\nStates scientist would be able to cooperate with a foreign\r\ncompany to evaluate, for example, an investment project in\r\nany scientific or industrial field in Cuba.\r\nSome figures deserve special mention. Only 15 days\r\nafter the adoption of the latest United Nations resolution\r\nagainst the blockade, at a hearing of the subcommittee of\r\nthe House of Representatives, it was recognized that, as a\r\nresult of the suspension in the granting of licences by the\r\nTreasury Department to subsidiaries of United States\r\ncorporations in third countries, trade with Cuba by United\r\nStates subsidiaries abroad fell to $1.8 million in 1993 in\r\ncontrast to a total of $718 million in 1991. In practical\r\nterms, trade that did not apply to luxury items, but rather,\r\nessentially, to the acquisition of medicine and foodstuffs in\r\nshort supply, virtually disappeared.\r\nAs the result of other restrictions contemplated in\r\nlegislation against Cuba, the Cuban economy had to spend\r\nmore than an additional $34 million in 1993 on foodstuffs\r\nalone owing to higher prices and freight costs than those\r\nto which Cuba had access.\r\nThe freight costs of tankers servicing Cuba have\r\nincreased by between 15 and 30 per cent in comparison\r\nwith normal prices. Something similar has occurred with\r\nregard to air freight. In general, the losses to the\r\neconomy for this reason alone amounted to more than $50\r\nmillion in 1993.\r\nAccording to the most recent estimates, damage to\r\nthe Cuban economy in 1993 alone as a direct result of the\r\nstrengthening of the blockade amount to more than $970\r\nmillion.\r\nThe United States Government also persists in the\r\nextraterritorial application of its laws and regulations\r\nregarding the blockade. It has not enough that countries\r\nwith close ties and relations with the United States had\r\nadopted special provisions prohibiting foreign companies\r\nlocated in their territory from complying with United\r\nStates law. Nor has it sufficed that in its 1993 report on\r\ntrade with the United States and investment barriers, the\r\nCommission of the European Communities condemned\r\nunilateral trade measures adopted by the United States\r\nGovernment, in particular those affecting freedom of trade\r\nand shipping. In that regard, the report concluded that the\r\ncontinuation of the extraterritorial application of United\r\nStates laws contributed to the creation of serious conflicts\r\nof jurisdiction between the United States and the\r\nCommunity and its member States; and that it also had a\r\nnegative influence on the climate for trade and investment\r\nbetween the United States and the Community.\r\nThe official response given by the Director of the\r\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control of the United States\r\nTreasury Department reaffirmed that his Government\r\nwould continue to apply United States law in the way in\r\nwhich it has been laid down and would require companies\r\nsubjected to that legislation to fulfil the provisions of the\r\nblockade against Cuba.\r\nBut above and beyond the consequences deriving\r\nfrom the extraterritorial dimension of the blockade, it is\r\nthe impact of the blockade on the most varied facets of\r\nCuban life that arouses international repudiation.\r\nThe situation created by the strengthening of the\r\nblockade continues very seriously to affect such matters\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nas the health and nutrition of the population. It is the\r\nchildren, the elderly, women and the sick who are the most\r\nseriously hurt. Moreover, the capacity to provide\r\ntransportation, electric power and other services is also\r\nsignificantly curtailed.\r\nThe sufferings of the Cuban people, the day-to-day\r\ndeficiencies, difficulties in purchasing the most basic staples\r\nto ensure life and even the deterioration of sectors that have\r\nfor years been an example for all of the third world —\r\nsuch as health and education services - are inevitable\r\nconsequences of the cruel blockade imposed against Cuba.\r\nIn this regard, the observations of the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund are especially significant. They appear in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General (A/49/398) on this item\r\nand they are illustrative of the effects of the blockade on\r\nCuba’s children. The damages pointed out in that document,\r\nwhich are directly associated with the reduction in the\r\navailability of foodstuffs and medical supplies, the\r\ndeterioration of the nutrition levels and the quality of the\r\ndrinking water, have been detected in the last two or three\r\nyears, coinciding with the reinforcement of the blockade.\r\nCuba’s efforts to purchase medicines or medical\r\nsupplies continue to be grossly abused. Restrictions are still\r\nin place forbidding any company anywhere in the world\r\nfrom selling to Cuba medicines or medical supplies of any\r\nkind containing components or technology originating in the\r\nUnited States. This even includes the purchase of items as\r\nsimple as pacemakers for people with heart conditions.\r\nGiven these facts, it is undeniable that the persistence\r\nof the economic, commercial and financial blockade against\r\nmy country constitutes a flagrant and general violation of\r\nthe fundamental rights of the Cuban people to\r\nindependence, sovereignty, and self-determination, as well\r\nas its right to development, health, nutrition and\r\nemployment, and even to life itself.\r\nOnly the development achieved by the country in 35\r\nyears, the social policy it has followed, the programmes it\r\nhas adopted to try to counter the negative effects of the\r\nstrengthening of the blockade and the measures and changes\r\nadopted to encourage the integration of the Cuban economy\r\ninto the new world economy - have prevented the\r\nconsequences of the blockade from taking on disastrous\r\ndimensions.\r\nPrecisely because of those efforts and the results\r\nachieved, my country has been able to resist this criminal\r\nblockade and the disappearance of its international\r\neconomic links forged over more than 30 years. They\r\nhave not only ensured the survival of our nation but, in\r\nthe course of the present year, several sectors of the\r\neconomy have begun to show clear signs of the\r\nbeginnings of recovery.\r\nIt is not idle to reaffirm that of all the limitations\r\nbesetting Cuba the only one that responds to a political\r\ninitiative on the part of a foreign Government and the\r\nonly one that could also disappear as a result of a\r\npolitical act is the United States blockade.\r\nIn spite of this, Cuba reaffirms its decision to\r\ncontinue along the path it has chosen independently and\r\nin all sovereignty — that is, the path of transformations\r\nto support its reintegration into the world market and to\r\nreactivate its productive structure. We will not agree to\r\nanything being imposed on us, but will continue this\r\nprocess, ensuring the preservation of the most important\r\nsocial achievements of more than 35 years and, above all,\r\nmaintaining the defence of our independence and national\r\nsovereignty — a sacred victory that we will never\r\nrenounce.\r\nAt the same time, we reaffirm our readiness to work\r\nto find political and negotiated solutions in order to\r\novercome differences with any country, on the sole basis\r\nof sovereign equality and mutual respect; we have clearly\r\nand unequivocally demonstrated this willingness both\r\ninternationally and bilaterally.The agreements on\r\nmigration issues recently concluded here in New York\r\nbetween delegations of Cuba and the United States are\r\nproof of this willingness, and they demonstrate what can\r\nbe achieved when there is a serious sense of responsibility\r\non both sides.\r\nNevertheless, in spite of those results, the only\r\nsubstantive solution that can eliminate all the existing\r\ndifferences continues to be the dismantling of the\r\naggressive policy against Cuba, a policy whose backbone\r\nis the economic, commercial and financial blockade.\r\nToday, when the many arguments that have been\r\nofficially brandished for more than 30 years to maintain\r\nthe blockade against Cuba have been disproved and left\r\nbehind by history and by recent developments in United\r\nStates policy, the blockade against Cuba constitutes not\r\nonly one of the greatest injustices but also one of the\r\ngreatest anachronisms in today’s world, lacking any sense\r\nor rationality whatsoever.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nSince that policy violates fundamental principles that\r\nare enshrined in the United Nations Charter and constitute\r\nthe very cornerstone of this Organization, as well as other\r\ninternationally recognized principles such as the freedom of\r\ntrade and navigation, we once again address the General\r\nAssembly with the aim of obtaining a new decision by the\r\nUnited Nations that will contribute to putting an end to the\r\nillegal blockade which is directed against Cuba today but of\r\nwhich any other nation could be the victim tomorrow.\r\nI have the honour therefore of introducing the draft\r\nresolution in document A/49/L.9, which has been the\r\nsubject of wide consultations with delegations here and has\r\nbeen published in all the official languages of the United\r\nNations. It basically maintains the structure, language and\r\nscope of resolution 48/16, adopted by the General\r\nAssembly at its last session; the only changes consist in\r\nupdating the situation by referring to the most important\r\ndevelopments that have taken place over the last year.\r\nThe decision that the General Assembly is to adopt\r\nshortly remains fundamental for the very existence of the\r\nUnited Nations and for the preservation of its guiding\r\nprinciples. Moreover, it affects the existence of an entire\r\npeople.\r\nWe therefore hope that, by the decisive and\r\noverwhelming adoption of this draft resolution, the General\r\nAssembly will once again reaffirm its commitment to those\r\nprinciples and its support for all those who, small though\r\nthey may be, are struggling to defend their independence.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): There have been major changes in the\r\ninternational system in recent years. Relations between\r\nStates are losing their markedly ideological nature, opening\r\na path to the strengthening of cooperation. In regard to\r\ntrade, there are signs of the opening of international\r\nmarkets and the liberalization and freedom of trade instead\r\nof discriminatory and obstructionist practices. At the same\r\ntime, we are witnessing instances of the extra-territorial\r\napplication of laws and measures with legal, political and\r\neconomic effects that distort relations between States.\r\nThe General Assembly, in adopting resolution 48/16\r\nlast year, reiterated its appeal to all States that they refrain\r\nfrom promulgating and applying laws and measures whose\r\nextra-territorial effects affect the sovereignty of other States.\r\nThe imposition of embargo measures has grave\r\nrepercussions on the economic life of the country affected,\r\nbecause it deflects normal flows of trade and promotes\r\nunjustifiable rises in the price of imports. It also has\r\ndirect effects on the well-being and health of a people —\r\nfrom changes in priorities to a deterioration in the quality\r\nof public services. The organs and agencies of the United\r\nNations system have produced significant data in that\r\nrespect, as the report of the Secretary-General in\r\ndocument A/49/398 indicates.\r\nWith regard to the specific case that is of concern to\r\nthe international community, the Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of Brazil, Ambassador Celso Amorim, stated\r\nduring the general debate of the present session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that\r\n“Political, economic and commercial isolation, apart\r\nfrom being unjustifiable, only contributes to\r\naggravating the hardship endured by the Cuban\r\npeople at a time when we perceive positive\r\nindications of democratic reform and reconciliation”\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-\r\nninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 4th meeting, p. 2)\r\nBrazil bases its foreign policy on the promotion of\r\nthe principles of the sovereign equality of States, non-\r\nintervention and non-interference in the domestic affairs\r\nof other countries, and freedom of international trade and\r\nnavigation.\r\nWe believe that States should give pride of place to\r\ndialogue and that any problem that arises between them\r\nshould be solved in conformity with the United Nations\r\nCharter and international law, not by unilateral measures.\r\nMy country will vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution before the Assembly for the sake of defending\r\nthe principles of international law and promoting peaceful\r\nand friendly relations between nations, and as an\r\naffirmation of the principles of cooperation. Cuba should\r\nnot be deprived of the opportunity to participate freely\r\nand without hindrance in international economic and\r\ncommercial relations.\r\nMr. Lopez-Pulecio (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My country’s foreign policy is based on a firm\r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations and the charter of the Organization\r\nof American States. Colombia believes that international\r\nrelations are based on the sovereign equality of States;\r\nrespect for their identity, sovereignty and independence;\r\ncompliance in good faith with international obligations;\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes; and non-intervention\r\nin the domestic affairs of States.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nThroughout my country’s history, various\r\nGovernments, led by diverse political parties, have\r\nmaintained a tradition of respect for and compliance with\r\nthe principles and norms of international law and a deep-\r\nrooted conviction that the inviolability of States’ autonomy\r\nis the basis of concord among them.\r\nAnother deep conviction of my country is that the\r\nstrengthening of democracy is intimately related to stability,\r\npeace and especially development, with a view to satisfying\r\nthe needs of society and guaranteeing well-being and\r\neconomic and social equity. Democracy flourishes in the\r\nfavourable environment of an internal, politically mature\r\nprocess, an essential condition for democracy’s stability and\r\ndurability.\r\nAn important part of this democratic climate is free\r\ntrade. There is no more formidable force for demolishing\r\nprivileges than the exercise of free trade and the equality of\r\nopportunity it generates. We have expressed this view at a\r\nnumber of opportunities offered in important international\r\nforums.\r\nInspired by the principles of the Charter, the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations has expressed its view in\r\ntwo resolutions on the necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the United\r\nStates of America against Cuba. Indeed, through its\r\nresolutions 47/19 and 48/16, the General Assembly called\r\non all States to refrain from promulgating and applying\r\nlaws and measures whose extraterritorial effects affect the\r\nsovereignty of other States and the legitimate interests of\r\nentities or persons under their jurisdiction, as well as the\r\nfreedom of trade and navigation. Colombia voted in favour\r\nof those resolutions.\r\nSimilarly, and also with Colombia’s support, a\r\nstatement was issued by the Ibero-American Heads of State\r\nor Government at the Summits held in Salvador de Bahia\r\nin 1993 and in Cartagena de Indias in 1994. The Heads of\r\nState or Government, in conformity with the principles of\r\ninternational law and General Assembly resolutions, voiced\r\nthe necessity to eliminate the coercive unilateral application\r\nof economic and trade measures which affect the free flow\r\nof international trade and harm the living conditions of\r\nIbero-American peoples.\r\nFurthermore, the Heads of State or Government of the\r\nRio Group, meeting in Rio de Janeiro on 9 and 10\r\nSeptember this year, expressed their determination, within\r\nthe framework of the principle of non-intervention, to\r\nproceed with a constructive dialogue with Cuba and\r\nstressed the need to lift the embargo against that sister\r\nRepublic.\r\nColombia takes this opportunity to reaffirm its\r\nlongstanding policy on a matter that has been the subject\r\nof pronouncements by the United Nations General\r\nAssembly and the Heads of State or Government of the\r\nIbero-American Summits and the Rio Group, as well as\r\nonce again to express its adherence to the principles and\r\nlaws governing relations between States.\r\nMr. Flores Olea (Mexico) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): This year has seen important steps taken\r\ntowards dialogue and peaceful coexistence. In regions that\r\nwere long affected by disputes and conflicts, we have\r\nseen surprising progress made in negotiations that have\r\nallowed us to foresee a lasting peace in various parts of\r\nthe world. We wish to express our satisfaction at the\r\nprogress made in the peace process, especially in the\r\nMiddle East, South Africa and Central America. Dialogue\r\nand negotiation have overcome confrontation and impasse.\r\nThe principles of international law upon which the\r\nvery existence of our Organization is based represent the\r\ncollective aspiration to be able to rely on a framework of\r\nrationality, order and legality and to make it possible for\r\nnations to entertain the best of relations. Mexico remains\r\nconvinced that, at this stage, dialogue, conciliation and\r\nnegotiated political solutions are acquiring greater\r\napplicability and relevance as the best paths towards\r\nunderstanding. Today, following the end of the cold war,\r\nexperience teaches us the necessity of finding new\r\nanswers to the aspirations to peace, justice and well-\r\nbeing. The ways of promoting the purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations Charter are far removed from\r\nhostility and violence.\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate that, as with all\r\nStates, it is the exclusive responsibility of Cuba and its\r\npeople to define the forms of organization and the\r\nobjectives and goals of its economic and social\r\ndevelopment. We appreciate the measures adopted by\r\nCuba to improve and modernize structures and\r\nprocedures, as well as a closer adherence to the general\r\ntrends towards globalization and interdependence. We also\r\nrecognize the constructive effort of its people and\r\nGovernment to broaden contacts and exchanges with all\r\ncountries and regions.\r\nWe wish, too, to reaffirm our conviction that it is\r\nprecisely dialogue that can end this longstanding dispute\r\nin our hemisphere, in a framework of full respect for the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nsovereignty and the right to self-determination of the Cuban\r\npeople. Dialogue has already lead to positive results, which\r\nwe welcome. Indeed, the same determination and\r\nperseverance must continue in order to make that dialogue\r\nbroader and more fruitful.\r\nBut only respect for international law can guarantee\r\nlasting peaceful coexistence between countries. Norms,\r\naccepted at the multilateral level, provide stability and\r\ncertainty to relations between States. With a view to the\r\nfuture, we must seize opportunities that may emerge in the\r\nprocess of global transformation. The obsolescence of old\r\npractices designed within the framework of bipolar\r\nconfrontation is increasingly evident.\r\nMexico has favoured and will always favour dialogue\r\nand negotiation as the most effective means to the solution\r\nof disputes. For all these reasons, my delegation will vote\r\nin favour of the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/49/L.9. Pressure imposed by one country upon another\r\nhas not been and never will be the best way to ensure a fair\r\ninternational order consistent with law and free of the threat\r\nof violence and force. We therefore hope to see a prompt\r\nresumption of the dialogue between the parties in order to\r\ndiscuss and negotiate their longstanding differences and\r\narrive at a state of normal relations and coexistence\r\nbetween equal States of the region.\r\nMr. Wisnumurti (Indonesia): I deem it a privilege to\r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the non-aligned\r\ncountries.\r\nIt is with deepening concern that we have observed the\r\nprolonged differences between the United States and Cuba.\r\nIt is also particularly regrettable that the adverse\r\nrelationship between the two countries, which has persisted\r\nfor over three decades, has been further aggravated by the\r\nimposition of numerous measures, including a devastating\r\nembargo on trade. Punitive economic actions on such an\r\nuntenable scale have inflicted immense hardship on the\r\npeople of Cuba. The resulting weakening of the Cuban\r\neconomy has profoundly affected living conditions in that\r\ncountry and has severely impeded its development efforts.\r\nContinuing economic pressure and isolation may well\r\nportend disastrous consequences, not only for Cuba but\r\nbeyond. We therefore believe that such differences, no\r\nmatter how deep and how intense they may be, should be\r\nresolved through sustained dialogue on the basis of equality\r\nand mutual respect.\r\nMany Member States have in the past expressed in no\r\nuncertain terms the inapplicability of unilateral economic\r\nand trade measures directed against other States for\r\npolitically motivated reasons. They have also declared\r\ntheir opposition to the promulgation of laws that have\r\nextra-territorial effects which impinge on freedom of trade\r\nand navigation, and thereby adversely affect the interests\r\nof many countries. Hence, the repeal of those laws would\r\nbe in conformity with the principles of the sovereignty of\r\nnations, non-intervention and non-interference. The\r\nnon-aligned countries have always maintained that the\r\nattainment of a stable peace, common security, and social\r\nand economic justice must be firmly rooted in the rule of\r\nlaw and the precepts of the Charter, which should not be\r\ndiluted or abridged.\r\nIn this regard, I should like to cite the communiqué\r\nissued by the Non-Aligned ministerial meeting held\r\nearlier this month in New York:\r\n“The Ministers and heads of delegation called\r\nupon the Government of the United States to\r\nterminate the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed on Cuba for over three decades\r\nand for the speedy and effective implementation of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. They further\r\nreaffirmed their view that the differences between\r\nthe two countries should be resolved peacefully and\r\nthrough comprehensive negotiations. They noted the\r\njoint communiqué signed by both countries on\r\nmigration on 9 September 1994, and expressed the\r\nview that it constituted a positive development in\r\nthis direction”.\r\nIt is now time to move on. The resumed talks on\r\nthe question of migration in Havana should now be\r\nextended to resolve outstanding political and economic\r\nissues, whose persistence for so long has proved\r\ndetrimental to the interests of the Cuban people.\r\nSpecifically, the lifting of the embargo will create a\r\nclimate more conducive to the normalization of relations\r\nbetween the two countries and contribute in a concrete\r\nmanner to the stability of the region and to the promotion\r\nof cooperation.\r\nIt is the hope of the non-aligned countries that\r\nrenewed consideration of this item and broad support for\r\nthe draft resolution now before us will lead to the speedy\r\nsolution of this issue, which will in turn promote the\r\neconomic progress and social advancement of the Cuban\r\npeople in an atmosphere of peace and tranquillity.\r\nMr. Mumbengegwi (Zimbabwe): Zimbabwe has\r\nstated on numerous occasions, both in the General\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nAssembly and in other international forums, that the end of\r\nthe cold war opened up a vista of opportunity for the\r\nsolution of hitherto seemingly intractable international\r\nproblems. It is therefore a source of deep regret to my\r\ndelegation that the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo against Cuba, which has its origins in the cold-war\r\nconfrontation, is still in place so long after the end of the\r\ncold war. The extra-territorial provisions of that embargo\r\nhave made it even more pernicious. It is extremely difficult\r\nto see how the Republic of Cuba, in the context of this\r\npost-cold-war era, could possibly pose a threat to the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\nWe would like to reiterate our view that universal\r\neconomic measures against any State should be imposed\r\nonly by collective enforcement action through the United\r\nNations. In the absence of any such enforcement action, all\r\ncountries should be able freely to carry out their economic,\r\ncommercial and financial transactions.\r\nApart from these important provisions of international\r\nlaw, Zimbabwe is particularly concerned at the devastating\r\neffect that the economic embargo against Cuba is having on\r\nthe humanitarian situation in that country. Cuba’s public-\r\nhealth, education and social-welfare systems, which ranked\r\namong the best in the world, have been adversely affected\r\nby the embargo, causing unnecessary suffering to the Cuban\r\npeople. Needless to say, the principal victims are the\r\nchildren, the women, the elderly and the sick.\r\nThe harsh measures that are being inflicted upon the\r\nCuban people are totally out of step with the spirit of our\r\ntimes, which dictates that care and compassion should be\r\nextended to the weak and the vulnerable and that disputes\r\nand differences should be resolved through negotiation,\r\ndialogue and reconciliation. The world today is full of\r\nexamples of former enemies and adversaries becoming the\r\nclosest of allies and friends.\r\nIt is our earnest hope that the current discussions\r\nbetween Cuba and the United States will create the\r\nnecessary environment and mutual understanding to enable\r\nthe two sides to undertake comprehensive discussions on\r\nthe wider issues relating to the lifting of the embargo.\r\nMr. Azwai (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): Today, the 26th of October, is a day of\r\nmourning in Libya. On that date, Italian colonialists exiled\r\ncountless Libyans to uninhabited or semi-inhabited Italian\r\nislands: one of the most abhorrent crimes Italian\r\ncolonialism committed against the Libyan people. It is my\r\nduty and the duty of my delegation to spend the day in\r\nprayer for the souls of the Libyan martyrs and to engage\r\nin no work, which is the least we can do for our departed\r\nbrethren. But the importance of this item, in the light of\r\nour friendly relations with the Cuban people and our\r\nunderstanding of and sympathy with their suffering as a\r\nresult of the embargo unjustly imposed upon them, just as\r\nit is imposed upon us, by the United States of America,\r\nmade it my duty to participate in this debate. It is\r\nunfortunate indeed that we small peoples have come to\r\nuse this forum as a wailing wall to shed our tears, voice\r\nour grievances and adopt resolutions that are never\r\nimplemented.\r\nArticle 32 of the Charter of the Economic Rights\r\nand Duties of States, adopted by the General Assembly at\r\nits twenty-ninth session, states that no State may use or\r\nencourage the use of economic, political or other\r\nmeasures to coerce another State in order to obtain from\r\nit the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.\r\nBased on this, and on other principles set out in numerous\r\ninternational legal instruments, which underline the\r\nsovereign co-equality of States and their equality with\r\nrespect to freedom of international trade and navigation,\r\nthe General Assembly adopted resolution 48/16, by which\r\nit called on all States to refrain from promulgating and\r\napplying laws and measures whose effect may infringe\r\nupon the sovereignty of other States, because such\r\nmeasures constitute a violation of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, specifically Article 1 (2), which states\r\nthat a main purpose of the United Nations is to develop\r\nfriendly relations among nations, and also because they\r\nrun counter to the principles of international law and\r\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions, including\r\nresolutions 38/197, 39/210, 40/185, 44/215 and 46/210.\r\nThose resolutions call on all countries to refrain from the\r\nthreat of imposing trade restrictions, blockades,\r\nembargoes and other economic sanctions and from the\r\nimposition of restrictions on developing countries, since\r\nthis runs counter to the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nother agreed multilateral commitments.\r\nAt its forth-seventh session, the General Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 47/19, by which the international\r\ncommunity conclusively rejected the economic, trade and\r\nfinancial blockade imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba and the pressure being exerted on\r\nother countries to stop cooperating with Cuba in those\r\nareas. This rejection was reconfirmed in resolution 48/16.\r\nYet the available information shows that the response to\r\nthose two resolutions has been disappointing. As stated by\r\nthe Foreign Minister of Cuba in his statement to the\r\nGeneral Assembly last month, this has not been limited to\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nsilence or to ignoring the Assembly’s appeal to countries to\r\nrefrain from promulgating and applying laws and measures\r\nsimilar to those imposed on Cuba. In fact, one Member\r\nState has adopted additional restrictive measures aimed at\r\ntightening the blockade against that small country in order\r\nto force it to abandon its political and economic orientation.\r\nThis totally contradicts the principles of international law\r\ncalling for non-intervention and non-interference in any\r\nform in the internal affairs of other countries.\r\nThe blockade that the United States of America has\r\nimposed on Cuba for more than three decades has created\r\ngreat economic difficulties and imposed restrictions on\r\neconomic and social development. It is not at all difficult\r\nto understand the disastrous consequences of this blockade,\r\nespecially for countries that have been subjected to similar\r\nand, sometimes, more stringent coercive measures, such as\r\nmy country, which has been subjected, since 1986, by the\r\nUnited States of America, to such measures. The United\r\nStates Administration has been renewing those measures\r\nonce a year under the pretext that Libya poses a threat to\r\nUnited States national security. Of course, this is not only\r\nuntrue, but also risible. How could a small country such as\r\nLibya threaten the security of the United States? How could\r\na small country such as Libya, with its limited resources,\r\npose a threat to the United States of America, a country the\r\nsize of a continent and the strongest in the world? It has\r\nnever been proven that Libya is the source of any threat,\r\nespecially to the security of the United States.\r\nOf course, it is the opposite that is true: in 1986, while\r\nLibya was asleep, cities were subjected to military\r\naggression from the air and the sea, in which the United\r\nStates employed more than 100 aircraft that had previously\r\nbeen at the ready to face the former Soviet Union.\r\nMoreover, coercive economic measures were adopted\r\nthrough the Security Council under the pretext of a mere\r\nsuspicion of alleged involvement by two Libyan citizens in\r\na certain incident. The United States of America and its\r\nallies know better than anyone else that Libya is entirely\r\nunconnected with that incident. If there is any proof or\r\nevidence, let an international court sitting in The Hague or\r\na Scottish court, or any other court in any place in the\r\nworld other than the United Kingdom and the United States\r\nof America, decide the issue. The only thing we reject is\r\nthat courts in the United Kingdom or the United States\r\nshould try the case, for a trial of the two suspects in either\r\nof those countries would be a show trial whose only aim\r\nwould be to besmear Libya. This, in fact, is the hidden\r\nmotive behind all the measures and all the actions aimed at\r\nLibya.\r\nMy delegation is totally convinced that economic\r\nblockades and other coercive measures will not resolve\r\ndisputes between States. Negotiations and other peaceful\r\nmeans remain the only logical way to settle disputes. The\r\nUnited States and Cuba have set successful precedents in\r\nthis respect, as recently as September 1994, and this\r\npositive course should continue to be pursued, particularly\r\nsince Cuba has always declared its readiness to continue\r\nin this direction because it is the proper way to settle its\r\nremaining disputes with the United States of America,\r\nincluding the issue of the economic, trade and financial\r\nblockade.\r\nMy country supports this approach in dealing with\r\nCuba and other countries against which similar measures\r\nhave been taken. If adopted, such an approach will lead\r\nto comprehensive international economic growth, will\r\nstrengthen the foundations of constructive international\r\ncooperation and foster friendly relations that would\r\nenhance international peace and security and create a\r\nspirit of confidence and trust amongst the world’s\r\npeoples.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic) (interpretation from French): Once again the\r\nGeneral Assembly is called upon to consider the necessity\r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed against the Republic of Cuba. As we all\r\nknow, that embargo, which dates back more than 30\r\nyears, has had an enormous effect on the living standards\r\nof the vast majority of the Cuban people. Above all, it\r\nhas not contributed one iota to that country’s efforts to\r\nbecome part of the world economy. Notwithstanding the\r\nrepeated appeals of the international community, the\r\nembargo, to our great regret, remains in force today.\r\nIn keeping with our obligations under the United\r\nNations Charter and international law, we in the Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic have never promulgated or\r\napplied such laws or measures, which in our view,\r\nderogate from the sovereignty of other States and harm\r\nfreedom of trade and navigation.\r\nLike all the world’s other peoples, the Cuban people\r\nare entitled to a life in dignity and prosperity. To attain\r\nthat noble goal, they must be allowed to establish\r\neconomic, commercial and other relations with the rest of\r\nthe world. In this new era, in which a spirit of\r\ncooperation between States generally prevails, should we\r\nnot promote and expand various types of economic\r\ncooperation between the peoples of our world, including\r\nthe Cuban people? It is only natural that such beneficial\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\ncooperation should be expanded and strengthened in the\r\ninterests of the entire world. We therefore find it difficult\r\nto agree with those who continue to advocate the adoption\r\nof anachronistic coercive economic measures against other\r\ncountries.\r\nIt is true that the item under consideration is sensitive\r\nand difficult. This debate is supposed to be a serious one,\r\none that should lead to a positive result. The innocent\r\nCuban people have already suffered greatly, and today they\r\ndeserve all our support and sympathy. Of course, we cannot\r\nbrush aside the arguments advanced by the parties, but if,\r\ntogether and with political will, we can look to the future\r\nwithout becoming overly mired in the past, a positive\r\nsolution to the problem can surely be found.\r\nIn the view of the Lao delegation, this debate is not an\r\noccasion for mutual criticism, but, rather, an opportunity to\r\ngain a full awareness of the situation and to seek, together,\r\na solution. On that note, we would make a friendly appeal\r\nto the two parties concerned, the Republic of Cuba and the\r\nUnited States of America, to commit themselves to sincere\r\ndialogue in order rapidly to reach a just and honourable\r\nsolution that satisfies the legitimate interests of both peoples\r\nand of peace in the region and the world.\r\nMr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Viet Nam) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): I would like first of all to thank the\r\nSecretary-General and his colleagues for the report before\r\nus, submitted in accordance with resolution 48/16, adopted\r\nby the Assembly a year ago.\r\nThe trend towards dialogue and international and\r\nregional cooperation is becoming a more and more\r\nirresistible force. In our view, international cooperation\r\nshould be based on the principles of respect for the\r\nindependence and national sovereignty of other countries,\r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs, mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation on an equal footing, the settlement of all\r\ndisputes through negotiation and the non-use of force or\r\nthreat of force.\r\nIn today’s world, where our awareness of\r\nindependence is being constantly reinforced, respect for\r\neach nation’s right to choose freely its own path of\r\ndevelopment and for its right to preserve its national\r\nidentity is an essential condition for the maintenance of\r\npeace and stability and for the strengthening of international\r\ncooperation. Blockade and sanction measures and the\r\nimposition of conditions in relations between States are\r\nvestiges of the past that go against the common will of\r\npeoples, the prevailing world-wide tendency and the\r\nprinciples of international law. Hence, we fully support all\r\nthe resolutions adopted by the countries of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement calling upon the United States to end\r\nits blockade against Cuba.\r\nWe reiterate Viet Nam’s position: laws whose effects\r\nare extraterritorial, because they harm not only Cuba’s\r\nlegitimate commercial interests but also those of third\r\ncountries, must be abrogated. The resolutions adopted in\r\nthis respect by the General Assembly must be promptly\r\nand effectively implemented.\r\nOn numerous occasions we have reaffirmed that the\r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States should be\r\nresolved by means of negotiation. We welcome the joint\r\ncommuniqué recently signed between those two countries\r\non the question of Cuban emigrants. We hope the two\r\nparties will continue their dialogue to resolve the other\r\noutstanding problems between them.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to convey the profound\r\nsympathy of the Vietnamese people for the people of\r\nCuba, which is now undergoing such hardship. In a spirit\r\nof understanding and solidarity with the Cuban people,\r\nthe Government and the people of Viet Nam have\r\nundertaken and will continue to undertake activities\r\nmanifesting solidarity and support, thus providing both\r\nmoral and material assistance to the people of Cuba to\r\nhelp them overcome their difficulties and the effects of\r\nthe blockade policy.\r\nMs. Zachariah (Malaysia): I am speaking on behalf\r\nof the Permanent Representative of Malaysia, Ambassador\r\nRazali Ismail.\r\nMalaysia wishes to support the statement by the\r\nrepresentative of Indonesia, who spoke in his capacity as\r\nChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement. The statement\r\nduly reflects the position taken by the leaders of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement at the Jakarta summit in 1992 and\r\nreiterated recently at the Non-Aligned Ministerial\r\nmeetings in Cairo in June this year and in New York\r\nearlier this month.\r\nIn our previous statements on this agenda item,\r\nMalaysia consistently expressed the belief that this matter\r\ncan best be settled between the two countries. At the\r\nsame time, Malaysia acknowledges Cuba’s right to appeal\r\nto the United Nations, particularly on an issue involving\r\nextraterritoriality, which impinges on the fundamental\r\nprinciples of international law and which runs counter to\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\na number of resolutions adopted over the years by this\r\nbody.\r\nWe believe that making international law prevail must\r\nbe the fundamental commitment of all nations. As Members\r\nof the United Nations, we are all obliged to support the\r\nfundamental principles of international law. Upholding the\r\nprinciples of international law and promoting peaceful and\r\nfriendly relations between nations have been basic tenets in\r\ngoverning relations. Consistent with these tenets, Malaysia\r\nwill vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania): I\r\nwish to express my delegation’s sincere appreciation of the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General contained in document\r\nA/49/398 of 20 September 1994, concerning agenda item\r\n24, now being considered by the General Assembly.\r\nLike last year’s report, this one contains replies from\r\nMember States on the implementation of resolution 48/16\r\nof 3 November 1993. The report is reassuring to the extent\r\nthat, of the 38 replies reproduced in the report, not a single\r\none records compliance with the contentious United States\r\nlaw that imposes an economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo on Cuba and seeks to extend the application of\r\ndomestic laws to third countries.\r\nRegrettably, the call to all States to refrain from\r\npromulgating and applying laws and measures such as those\r\nimposed on Cuba continues to be flouted. Indeed, draft\r\nresolution A/49/L.9, now before the Assembly, affirms the\r\nconcern that, since the adoption of resolutions 47/19 and\r\n48/16, further measures aimed at strengthening and\r\nextending the embargo against Cuba have been promulgated\r\nand applied, with dire effects on the Cuban people.\r\nTanzania has consistently supported those resolutions\r\nbecause their overwhelming adoption by the Assembly\r\nattests to the international community’s clear rejection of\r\nthe embargo against Cuba and of any pressures exerted on\r\nthird countries to withhold cooperation from that country.\r\nWe also maintain the view that the embargo is a\r\nviolation of the provisions of Article 1 of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations — in particular, the provisions of paragraph\r\n2, which stipulates that the fundamental purpose of the\r\nUnited Nations is the development of friendly relations\r\namong nations, based on respect for the principles of equal\r\nrights and the self-determination of peoples.\r\nThe changing post-cold-war era is replete with\r\npromises of improved understanding and cooperation. The\r\nnew environment calls on the community of nations to\r\ncoexist in peace with mutual respect and full observance\r\nof international law. In this connection, Tanzania believes\r\nthat embargoes, such as that imposed on Cuba, and the\r\nattendant extension of the application of national laws to\r\nthird countries are not in keeping with the mood of the\r\ntimes and are at variance with the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nAs many delegations have stressed in the course of\r\nthis debate, amicable negotiations offer the only sensible\r\nway to resolve the differences between the United States\r\nand Cuba. Fortunately, Tanzania maintains salutary\r\ndiplomatic and consular relations with both countries.\r\nTherefore, in full trust and friendship towards these\r\nneighbourly countries, we hope that they will put to full\r\nuse their capacity to engage in meaningful dialogue for\r\nthe mutual benefit of their peoples. Their recent encounter\r\nin New York to negotiate on immigration matters was as\r\nconstructive as it was amply demonstrative of their latent\r\nenergy to initiate negotiations leading to the lifting of the\r\nembargo and to improved relations.\r\nIn conclusion, Tanzania wishes to express the hope\r\nthat the climate is ripe for the lifting, during the course of\r\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, of the\r\nembargo imposed against Cuba more than 30 years ago.\r\nIn this context, we support draft resolution A/49/L.9, as\r\nit provides further impetus towards good-neighbourliness\r\nbetween the United States and Cuba.\r\nMr. Van Dunem “Mbinda” (Angola): Allow me,\r\nMr. President, to reiterate my delegation’s appreciation of\r\nthe way in which you are conducting the General\r\nAssembly’s proceedings.\r\nIt is indeed a great honour for me to address the\r\nAssembly on this important agenda item, “Necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba”.\r\nI do so in the hope that a comprehensive solution can be\r\nfound.\r\nAt a time when the international community is\r\nencouraging the settlement of disputes between States by\r\nnegotiation and other peaceful means it is unacceptable\r\nand senseless that unilateral measures, such as the\r\neconomic blockade against Cuba, continue to be applied\r\nas a solution to internal problems and to settle bilateral\r\ndifferences. Recent developments in the Middle East, on\r\nthe Korean peninsula and in Northern Ireland clearly\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\ndemonstrate that dialogue is preferable to any other course.\r\nThe blockade against Cuba violates — particularly\r\nbecause of its extraterritorial application — the principles\r\nof international law and the objectives enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Angola deplores the fact that, in\r\nspite of General Assembly resolutions 47/19 and 48/16,\r\nwhich urge that it be lifted, the embargo has, rather, been\r\ntightened, thus jeopardizing all United Nations efforts in\r\nthis regard and giving rise to gravely deteriorating living\r\nconditions for the people of that sister country.\r\nThe embargo and its tightening, far from contributing\r\nto a solution of internal problems, will lead only to violence\r\nand to the loss of lives and property, and it will continue to\r\naffect mainly the people of that island — particularly\r\nchildren and women.\r\nAngola is very encouraged by the quick and positive\r\nmanner in which Cuba and the United States are conducting\r\ntheir bilateral talks on migration issues, which led to the\r\nconclusion of the Agreement signed in New York last\r\nSeptember. We strongly believe that if the same\r\ndetermination is applied to solving the outstanding issues\r\nconcerning the two countries — in particular, the question\r\nof the economic blockade — the tension in the relations\r\nbetween them will soon be alleviated. Therefore, we\r\nstrongly appeal to both countries to enter into dialogue so\r\nthat these last remaining consequences of the cold war may\r\nbe completely eradicated.\r\nAs in previous years, my country will vote in favour\r\nof the draft resolution.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): Having\r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item, we shall\r\nproceed to consider draft resolution A/49/L.9.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nexplain their votes before the voting. May I first remind\r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10\r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Marrero (United States of America): The United\r\nStates notes that the question before us today is a bilateral\r\nissue. The United States, like any other nation, has the\r\nsovereign right to determine its bilateral relationships,\r\nincluding its trading partners.\r\nThe goal of United States policy is, through the\r\ncareful application of sanctions directed at the Cuban\r\nrégime, to promote a peaceful transition to democracy.\r\nWe have made it clear, on many occasions, that\r\nreviewing our embargo depends upon whether the Cuban\r\nrégime moves towards democracy and observes\r\ninternational norms regarding human rights. Our response\r\nwill be calibrated to reforms in Cuba.\r\nThe human rights situation in Cuba remains grim; it\r\nhas not improved. Concerted suppression of all dissent\r\nand the absence of many fundamental human freedoms\r\nstill prevail. If anything, the situation has worsened in\r\nrecent months as the Government has cracked down on\r\ndissidents and human rights activists following a major\r\nexpression of anti-Government feeling in Havana in\r\nAugust. The recent massive seaborne exodus from Cuba,\r\nin which thousands risked their lives, showed how little\r\nhope Cubans have for a better life and future under the\r\ncurrent régime.\r\nTherefore, the United States maintains the embargo\r\nin order to keep pressure on the Castro régime to\r\nestablish freedom and democracy, because Americans\r\noppose the repression of their Cuban friends by a\r\ndictatorial régime - the last one in this hemisphere.\r\nThe Cuban leadership often cites the embargo as the\r\nreason for Cuba’s increasing economic troubles. The real\r\nproblem, however, lies with the failed economic policies\r\nof the régime. Its economic control has failed to generate\r\nthe foreign exchange to purchase imported goods\r\nsufficient to meet the import needs of the Cuban people.\r\nWhat is sorely missing in the inappropriate\r\nresolution before the General Assembly is mention of the\r\nneed\r\n“for a peaceful transition to a democratic and\r\npluralistic system which respects human rights and\r\nfreedom of opinion”,\r\nas stated in the Rio Group’s declaration of September this\r\nyear.\r\nCuba has trumpeted similar General Assembly\r\nresolutions as triumphs for its dictatorial actions, while\r\nconcealing from the Cuban people other calls of\r\ninternational organizations for democratic reform and\r\nhuman rights in Cuba. The General Assembly should not\r\nappear to condone the abuses of a repressive régime.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nWe recognize that the people of Cuba must determine\r\nthe future that they want for their nation. However, for 35\r\nyears they have been denied the right to choose their own\r\nrepresentatives, to voice their opinions without fear of\r\nreprisal, to meet or to organize freely.\r\nThe United States embargo is our way of signalling\r\ncontinuing strong disapproval of the Cuban regime’s\r\nintransigence - its unwillingness to move towards\r\ndemocracy or to respect the human rights of the Cuban\r\npeople. A vote against the resolution before us will\r\nreinforce that signal. We ask that this body not support\r\nanother message to the Cuban people that this body\r\nendorses their repression. The United States will not send\r\nsuch a message, and therefore will not vote for this\r\nresolution.\r\nMr. Zhaoxing (China) (interpretation from the\r\nChinese): In its resolutions 47/19 and 48/16, the General\r\nAssembly reiterated such principles as equality of national\r\nsovereignty, non-intervention and non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of another country, and called on all\r\ncountries to fulfil their obligations under the United Nations\r\nCharter and to abide by international law and the\r\ninternational freedoms of navigation and trade. This has\r\nreflected the just aspiration of the international community.\r\nRegrettably, the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo against Cuba, which has lasted for more than three\r\ndecades, still exists, causing enormous difficulties for\r\nCuba’s economy and great suffering for its people and even\r\nleading to a huge exodus of Cuban refugees and instability\r\nearlier this year. This cannot but draw grave concern from\r\nthe international community.\r\nIt is the consistent position of the Chinese Government\r\nthat the right of people in all countries to choose their own\r\nsocial systems and that their paths of development should\r\nbe respected. We oppose the interference in the internal\r\naffairs of other countries through resort to an economic\r\nembargo and other methods of power politics.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, there has been an\r\ninternational trend, in both bilateral and multilateral\r\ndiplomacy, towards resolving State-to-State disputes and\r\ndifferences through negotiation and dialogue rather than\r\nthrough sanctions and confrontation. We hope that the\r\ncountry concerned will give up its policy and practice of\r\nimposing pressure and embargoes on other sovereign\r\nStates on the basis of its own domestic law, and will act\r\nin the spirit of the United Nations Charter and in line\r\nwith the norms of international law and the relevant\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions by resolving its dispute\r\nwith Cuba through negotiation and dialogue.\r\nIn view of those considerations, the delegation of\r\nChina will vote in favour of draft resolution A/48/L.9.\r\nMr. Henze (Germany): I am speaking on behalf of\r\nthe European Union in explanation of vote on draft\r\nresolution A/49/L.9. Austria, Finland, Norway and\r\nSweden also support this statement.\r\nThe European Union strongly favours a peaceful\r\ntransition to democracy and a market economy in Cuba.\r\nWe are concerned about the negative effects of the\r\nembargo on the situation of the Cuban population.\r\nHowever, this is not the main reason for the difficult\r\nsituation in Cuba. Because of its choices in economics\r\nand politics, the Cuban Government is largely responsible\r\nfor the deterioration of the situation in the country.\r\nThe European Union condemns the repeated\r\nviolations of human rights in Cuba, in particular in the\r\npolitical field.\r\nThe Cuban Government has embarked on a process\r\nof limited economic reform that will we hope pave the\r\nway towards a more comprehensive plan to move to a\r\nmarket economy. In the political field, the Cuban\r\nGovernment retains a firm monopoly on political power.\r\nAdditional efforts to promote dialogue and cooperation at\r\nall levels are required to allow for the necessary evolution\r\ntowards democracy and pluralism, as elsewhere in Latin\r\nAmerica.\r\nThe opposition of the European Union to any\r\nextraterritorial application of national legislation is well\r\nknown. We have always rejected the United States actions\r\naimed at involving third States in the application of\r\ncommercial measures that fall exclusively within the\r\nforeign or security policy of the United States.\r\nAccordingly, we have opposed United States legislative\r\ninitiatives, including the Cuban Democracy Act, designed\r\nto tighten further the unilateral trade embargo against\r\nCuba by the extraterritorial application of United States\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\njurisdiction. We believe that such measures violate the\r\ngeneral principles of international law and the sovereignty\r\nof independent States.\r\nThe European Union cannot accept the United States\r\nunilateral determination and restriction of European Union\r\neconomic and commercial relations with any foreign nation.\r\nThe European Union believes that the United States\r\ntrade embargo against Cuba is primarily a matter that has\r\nto be resolved bilaterally between the Government of the\r\nUnited States and the Government of Cuba. The member\r\nStates of the European Union, as well as Austria, Finland,\r\nNorway and Sweden, will have these concerns in mind\r\nwhen voting on the draft resolution before us.\r\nMr. Kudriavtsev (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): The Russian Federation intends to vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution on ending the economic\r\nembargo against Cuba, contained in document A/49/L.9,\r\nsince we can agree neither with the unilateral actions\r\nundertaken in violation of time-honoured norms of\r\ninternational law, nor with the practice of extending the\r\ndomestic jurisdiction of States beyond the confines of their\r\nown territory, which does harm to third countries.\r\nRussia believes that the unilateral measures taken\r\nunder the commercial and financial blockade of Cuba, not\r\nonly do not promote more openness in Cuban society, but\r\non the contrary impede democratic transformations and\r\neconomic reforms in that country, and hamper Cuba’s fuller\r\nintegration into international and Latin American economic\r\nstructures. The continuation of this approach is consonant\r\nneither with the positive signs that have appeared recently\r\npointing to the start of economic reforms in Cuba, nor with\r\nthe decision by Havana to accede to the Treaty of\r\nTlatelolco, nor with the invitation made to Cuba by the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. But\r\nof course this does not denote any change in our position\r\nof principle with regard to the guaranteeing of human\r\nrights.\r\nThe Russian delegation believes that a mutually-\r\nacceptable solution to the economic blockade of Cuba\r\nshould be sought primarily through constructive dialogue\r\nbetween the United States and Cuba, with the aim of\r\nnormalizing relations between them. In this connection, we\r\nwelcome the negotiating process, which has recently been\r\nexpanded between the two countries.\r\nAs far as Russia is concerned, we continue to support\r\nnormal commercial relations with Cuba on the basis of\r\nmutual advantage, and in strict compliance with generally\r\naccepted principles of sovereign equality of States, non-\r\ninterference in their internal affairs and freedom of trade.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in explanation of vote before\r\nthe vote.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/49/L.9. A recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour: Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola,\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Bahamas,\r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin,\r\nBolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burundi,\r\nCambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cape Verde, Chile, China,\r\nColombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Denmark, Ecuador, Ethiopia,\r\nFinland, France, Ghana, Greece, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti,\r\nHonduras, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of),\r\nIraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein,\r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali,\r\nMauritania, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Myanmar,\r\nNamibia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria,\r\nNorway, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay,\r\nPeru, Philippines, Russian Federation, Saint Lucia,\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Seychelles,\r\nSouth Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname,\r\nSweden, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand,\r\nTogo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uganda, Ukraine,\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Venezuela,\r\nViet Nam, Yemen, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst: Israel, United States of America\r\nAbstaining: Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Bhutan,\r\nBrunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nCzech Republic, El Salvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Fiji,\r\nGabon, Georgia, Germany, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland,\r\nIreland, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan,\r\nLatvia, Lithuania, Maldives, Malta, Marshall Islands,\r\nMicronesia (Federated States of), Morocco, Nepal,\r\nNetherlands, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea,\r\nRepublic of Moldova, Romania, Rwanda, San Marino,\r\nSingapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Swaziland, The Former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Vanuatu\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nDraft resolution A/49/L.9 was adopted by 101 votes to\r\n2, with 48 abstentions (resolution 49/9)*.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I shall\r\nnow call on those representatives who wish to explain their\r\nvotes. I remind delegations that explanations of vote are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations\r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Fukushima (Japan): I have asked to speak to put\r\non record the position of Japan in abstaining in the vote on\r\ndraft resolution A/49/L.9.\r\nAs indicated last year and the year before, Japan has\r\nsome doubts as to whether a discussion at the United\r\nNations General Assembly can actually be conducive to\r\nresolving, in a constructive way, the question of the United\r\nStates embargo against Cuba.\r\nThis question is very complex in nature. Japan\r\nwonders if the resolution that has just been adopted can in\r\nfact properly address such complexity. If not, the question\r\nwill remain unsettled until a better way is found to achieve\r\nan appropriate solution.\r\nMr. Motsyk (Ukraine) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine voted in favour of the draft\r\nresolution which has just been adopted by the General\r\nAssembly. In so doing, the delegation of Ukraine believes\r\nthat the adoption and application by States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations of legislation of an extraterritorial nature, in\r\nparticular an economic embargo, can adversely affect the\r\nsovereignty and legitimate interests of other States, as well\r\nas freedom of trade and navigation.\r\nIn our view such measures run counter to the\r\ngenerally recognized principles of international law. We\r\nbelieve that only those sanctions that have been duly\r\nimposed by the international community on the basis of\r\ndecisions taken by the United Nations deserve international\r\nsupport.\r\nUkraine will not accept the use of economic measures\r\nas a means to attain any political goals and believes that\r\nrelations between States should be established in full\r\ncompliance with the basic principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter and the norms of international law.\r\nUkraine, having voted in favour of the draft resolution,\r\nhopes that there will be a speedy settlement of this\r\nprotracted conflict in the relationship between two States —\r\na conflict that dates back to a period of confrontation\r\nduring the cold war — by means of establishing an open\r\ndialogue based on mutual trust and sovereign equality.\r\nMr. Hayes (Ireland): The representative of Germany\r\ngave an explanation of vote on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, of which Ireland is a member, and on behalf of\r\nAustria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. My delegation\r\nfully endorses that explanation.\r\nIreland abstained in the vote on the resolution. That\r\ndoes not mean that Ireland supports a continuation of the\r\nmeasures with which the resolution deals. On the\r\ncontrary, the Irish Government agrees with the call to all\r\nStates to refrain from promulgating and applying laws and\r\nmeasures of the kind referred to in the resolution. We\r\nfurther believe, in the light of the great changes that have\r\ntaken place in recent years in international affairs, that\r\nStates that apply such laws and measures should consider\r\nurgently their repeal.\r\nThe question that arises in relation to the United\r\nStates and Cuba is how best to encourage development in\r\nthis direction and whether the adoption of the resolution\r\nat this time is the best way to achieve that aim.\r\nIn this respect the Irish Government has been greatly\r\nheartened by the recent talks between the Governments of\r\nthe two countries. We want to encourage that process and\r\nallow it time to develop. The resolution which has just\r\nbeen adopted, envisages a review of the issue at next\r\nyear’s session of the General Assembly. We sincerely\r\nhope that before then the embargo will be lifted and that\r\nthe conditions can be created to enable the relations\r\nbetween the United States and Cuba to be normalized.\r\nIreland’s concerns in relation to human rights in\r\nCuba and to the extraterritorial application of national\r\nlegislation were set out in the explanation of vote\r\ndelivered by the representative of Germany, to which I\r\nhave already referred.\r\nMr. Karsgaard (Canada): After careful\r\nconsideration, Canada supported the resolution we have\r\njust adopted.\r\nI would underline that Canada’s primary concern\r\nwith the embargo is its extraterritorial reach, the way in\r\nwhich the laws and regulations governing the embargo\r\nseek to constrain the freedom of trade of third countries\r\nsuch as Canada. Canada has always taken a vigorous\r\nstand against such measures and in 1992 issued a\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nblocking order to ensure that Canadian companies were not\r\nsubjected to foreign laws on trade with Cuba.\r\nI also wish to stress that our vote on this resolution\r\ndoes not imply that the embargo should be blamed for all\r\nthe difficulties Cuba currently faces. In our view, reform in\r\nCuba is necessary. Last June, the Canadian Government\r\nmade a number of adjustments in its policy towards Cuba\r\nwhich were intended to assist Cubans in need at the\r\ngrass-roots level, and to enhance our ability to support\r\neconomic and political reform in Cuba. I would mention in\r\nparticular our continuing concerns over the state of human\r\nrights and democratic development in Cuba. We will\r\ncontinue, both bilaterally and in the forums offered by the\r\nUnited Nations, to press for improvement in these areas.\r\nAt the same time, we believe that in this post-cold-war\r\nworld, the international community should engage with\r\nCuba, not isolate it, in order to achieve our goals.\r\nMr. McKinnon (New Zealand): New Zealand has\r\nvoted in favour of the resolution contained in document\r\nA/49/L.9. We did however cast this vote with some\r\nreservations.\r\nWe voted in favour because there is an important\r\nunderlying principle at stake with direct implications for\r\neconomic and trading interests. We consider that all\r\ncountries must be able to go about their ordinary economic,\r\ncommercial, financial and trading business free from the\r\nextraterritorial reach of legislation imposed unilaterally by\r\nthird countries.\r\nWe would have preferred, however, a resolution on\r\nthis subject to have been solely concerned with this\r\nprinciple. It is with regret therefore that we note that the\r\nresolution continues to contain certain extraneous material\r\nunrelated to concerns about the extraterritorial reach of\r\nlegislation and that it also draws selectively on principles\r\ncontained in the Charter. We also regret that this year’s text\r\nis once again aimed at institutionalizing this matter in the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nEqually, we wish to emphasize that our vote is not to\r\nbe interpreted in any way as support for the policies or\r\npractices of Cuba. Our action in casting a positive vote for\r\nthis resolution is due to our concern over the principle at\r\nstake.\r\nMrs. Klein-Loemban Tobing (Suriname): The\r\ndelegation of Suriname voted this year in favour of the\r\nresolution on the necessity of ending the embargo against\r\nCuba.\r\nThe decision to vote in favour was prompted by the\r\npositive trend prevailing in the world today, which is\r\nsupported by the United Nations and subscribed to by the\r\nGovernment of Suriname, to solve problems through\r\ndialogue, cooperation and understanding.\r\nSuriname has always supported the promotion of\r\nfriendly and progressive relations among peoples and the\r\nnon-use of coercive measures in relations among States.\r\nAt the same time, however, my delegation continues\r\nto be concerned about the fact that not every country in\r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean region has a\r\ndemocratically elected Government in conformity with the\r\ntrend which has developed in recent years in this region.\r\nThe Surinamese delegation strongly supports efforts\r\nby the international community with a view to the\r\nrestoration of democracy and the protection of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms in the entire Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean region.\r\nNr. Nieto (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nArgentina has once again abstained in the vote on the\r\nresolution just adopted because we believe that this text\r\npresents a problem of a bilateral nature between two\r\nStates with which we have deep relations of friendship.\r\nArgentina trusts that the Cuban people can look\r\nforward to a future of freedom through a peaceful\r\ntransition to a democratic and pluralistic regime.\r\nLikewise, we are sure that in the course of the talks\r\nbetween the two countries that were resumed earlier this\r\nweek they will be able to take up those issues that they\r\nbelieve deserve urgent treatment.\r\nMr. Tejera-Paris (Venezuela) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): In recent years, the international system has\r\nmade substantial strides towards peace and a healthier\r\nclimate of trade through dialogue and direct negotiation.\r\nWe all agree on the need to encourage those initiatives\r\nand to promote a climate of confidence and friendship\r\namong States in every sphere providing for full\r\ncompliance with the United Nations Charter, the rules of\r\ninternational law and the international legal instruments.\r\nIt was precisely in support of those aims that we have\r\nvoted in favour of the resolution.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nWe believe that the result of the voting is exclusively\r\na confirmation of those principles, not as a parliamentary\r\nfailure or success.\r\nThe problems besetting mankind need to be resolved\r\nthrough a strengthening of international cooperation and\r\nagreement and not through any military, political or\r\neconomic coercion or any other form of pressure that\r\nundermines the independence and sovereignty of peoples.\r\nWe therefore believe that the imposition of unilateral\r\neconomic measures represents an obstacle to free\r\nparticipation in economic relations between nations and that\r\nit is incompatible with our aspirations to establish a socially\r\nand economically just international order.\r\nThe vestiges that still remain of interventionist policies\r\nare not limited to impositions by one executive on another\r\nexecutive. The two other classic branches of government\r\nalso at times embark upon such initiatives and we should\r\ntherefore recall that legislations can have an effect outside\r\nof borders only when treaties have been signed.\r\nWe believe that the adoption of measures of this\r\nnature by one State against another for political reasons\r\ndoes not contribute to resolving the differences between\r\nthem. As we have witnessed in many situations, they rather\r\nstimulate confrontation and result in suffering among the\r\npopulation without generating changes in the regimes\r\nagainst which they are imposed. They generate a natural\r\nnationalistic reaction, a reaction which tends to hamper a\r\nhealthy return to democracy and to greater respect for\r\nhuman rights.\r\nOn the other hand, the new, emerging atmosphere of\r\nunderstanding and cooperation presents an extraordinary\r\nopportunity to leave behind the sequels of ideological\r\nconfrontation. We therefore share the idea of promoting a\r\npositive atmosphere in which to resolve all problems\r\nderiving from confrontations that persist in our continent.\r\nIn Rio de Janeiro, our President, Mr. Rafael Caldera,\r\nrecently stated the following:\r\n“We hope that the United States of America and the\r\nRepublic of Cuba will make peace with each other,\r\nalong the lines established by international law and in\r\nkeeping with the concord that is now being practised\r\nby civilized countries. A cessation of the blockade\r\nimposed upon the Cubans would be one direct and\r\nimmediate consequence of such a decision, and based\r\nupon it a new phase of discussion could begin to\r\nresolve the other pending issues that may exist\r\nbetween the two countries.”\r\nMr. Gervais (Côte d\u0027Ivoire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Côte d\u0027Ivoire has abstained once again in the\r\nvote on the necessity of ending the economic, commercial\r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba. My delegation’s abstention in no\r\nway reflects a wish to see extended the tragedy of the\r\nCuban people, which has for so many years been\r\nsubjected to the economic and social difficulties generated\r\nby the blockade, but is predicated upon its belief in\r\navoiding any impediment to the ongoing process that Côte\r\nd\u0027Ivoire has always advocated - namely, the bilateral talks\r\nfinally embarked upon by the United States and Cuba.\r\nCôte d\u0027Ivoire welcomes the establishment of this\r\ndialogue and hopes that it will continue and be speedily\r\ncompleted, in order to put an end to the unfair blockade\r\nof which the Cuban people is the unfortunate victim and\r\nwhich runs counter to the principles of our Charter.\r\nMr. Mwaungulu (Malawi): In past votes on similar\r\ndraft resolutions, the Malawian delegation abstained. That\r\ndid not mean that Malawi supported the economic\r\nembargo against Cuba or, indeed, that it opposed the draft\r\nresolutions.\r\nHowever, the Malawian delegation has now voted in\r\nfavour of the adoption of draft resolution A/49/L.9, on the\r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba. In doing so, the\r\nMalawian delegation is of the firm conviction that this\r\nmatter is long overdue and should be resolved, thereby\r\nending the unnecessary suffering it is imposing on the\r\ninnocent Cuban people. The best, proven format for\r\nresolving the outstanding problems that exist between\r\nCuba and its bigger and most powerful neighbour, the\r\nUnited States, is the process of bilateral discussions. This\r\nprocess is, in fact, already in motion, albeit on one issue\r\nonly, and it should be expanded and intensified.\r\nThe Malawian delegation strongly believes that all\r\nimpediments to a productive dialogue between Cuba and\r\nthe United States should be removed. Only then can an\r\natmosphere conducive to its success be established. The\r\nremoval of the existing economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo by the United States against Cuba\r\nwould be a positive step in this direction.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in explanation of vote.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 24?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): Before\r\ntaking up the next item, I should like to announce that the\r\nGeneral Committee will meet on Friday, 28 October, at\r\n9.30 a.m. in Conference Room 3, in order to consider a\r\nrequest for the inclusion of an additional sub-item submitted\r\nby Rwanda and contained in document A/49/233 and a\r\nrequest for the inclusion of an additional item submitted by\r\na number of countries and contained in document A/49/234.\r\nI should also like to draw the attention of\r\nrepresentatives to document A/49/452, containing a letter\r\naddressed to me by the Chairman of the Fifth Committee\r\nconcerning the proposed revisions to the medium-term plan\r\nfor the period 1992-1997, and to document A/49/6\r\ncontaining programme 6 of the medium-term plan\r\nconcerning the elimination of apartheid.\r\nMembers will recall that at the 16th plenary meeting,\r\nheld on 4 October 1994, I requested delegations to submit,\r\nin writing, their views on the programme, for transmittal to\r\nthe Chairman of the Fifth Committee.\r\nI should like to inform members that we have received\r\nno replies to date. I shall therefore send a letter to the\r\nChairman of the Fifth Committee informing him\r\naccordingly.\r\nAgenda item 22 (continued)\r\nAssistance in mine clearance\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/49/357 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/49/L.8)\r\nAmendment (A/49/L.11)\r\nPrince Sisowath Sirirath (Cambodia): Mr. President,\r\non 30 September 1994, my Government, expressed its\r\nwarm congratulations to you on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-\r\nninth session. Allow me, as your friend and colleague who\r\nhas had the honour and privilege of working closely with\r\nyou for many years, to pay homage to you personally\r\nfrom this rostrum and to wish you every success in the\r\nprofessional manner in which you are guiding the\r\nAssembly.\r\nA little more than a year has passed since Cambodia\r\nheld free and fair elections under the supervision of the\r\nUnited Nations. The outcome brought about a\r\ndemocratically elected Parliament and Government.\r\nAlthough Cambodia is now looked upon by the world as\r\na country that enjoys peace and harmony, its countryside\r\nis still heavily infested with land-mines, and the need to\r\nclear them is becoming ever more urgent.\r\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia attaches great\r\nimportance to the problem of land-mines. That is why my\r\ndelegation is very pleased to be a sponsor of draft\r\nresolution A/49/L.8, “Assistance in mine clearance”,\r\nwhich was introduced before the Assembly by my\r\ncolleague the Permanent Representative of Germany, on\r\nbehalf of the European Union.\r\nCambodia, a country ravaged by war for more than\r\n20 years, appreciates the initiative taken on this land-mine\r\nproblem by the European Union. My delegation notes\r\nwith great satisfaction the report of the Secretary-General\r\nin document A/49/357, entitled \"Assistance in mine\r\nclearance\".\r\nSo much has been written about Cambodia during\r\nthe past two decades - about its war, occupation, poverty\r\nand refugees - though very little has been based on\r\nfirst-hand observation of the horror of land-mines, and so\r\nmuch happened prior to that which has been forgotten or\r\nremains confused and obscure, that the average citizen in\r\nmy country has every reason to be puzzled and\r\nfrightened.\r\nMines in Cambodia have been laid over a period of\r\nmore than two decades by all parties and countries\r\ninvolved in the country’s conflict. It is difficult for any\r\nCambodian to think about his or her country without an\r\nalmost constant sense of revived sadness and guilt, not\r\nonly for the war which ravaged their land and the vast\r\nloss of life and tremendous destruction it caused, but also\r\nfor the decline and degradation of the arable lands\r\nthemselves — due to a high increase in injuries caused by\r\nland-mines among agricultural workers. These deadly\r\ndevices limit Cambodia’s ability to meet its own food\r\nrequirements and to expand its productive base, and they\r\nare a constant and serious threat. They continue to create\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nmore than 300 amputees per month, soldiers and\r\nnon-combatants alike - more than any other weapon.\r\nDeeply concerned about the dangerous situation facing\r\nCambodia today, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk has\r\non several occasions made his position on this issue very\r\nclear by severely condemning the use of land-mines. His\r\nMajesty has called upon the countries of the world to halt\r\nthe production of land-mines and to destroy all those that\r\nare still being stockpiled. Our King highly appreciated the\r\nactions of those concerned countries that have declared\r\nmoratoriums on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel\r\nland-mines and related devices. His Majesty has also called\r\nupon the Cambodian National Assembly to pass legislation\r\nbanning these deadly devices in Cambodia forever.\r\nHence, my Government welcomed President Clinton’s\r\naddress to this body on 26 September, in which he\r\nproposed the first step towards the eventual elimination of\r\nthe world’s 85-or-so million anti-personnel land-mines.\r\nCambodia, a country that possesses 8 to 10 million mines\r\non its soil, supports the United States President’s call to\r\njoin him in concluding an agreement to reduce the number\r\nand availability of those mines. This is indeed welcome\r\nnews because, as we know, land-mines, unlike chemical\r\nand biological weapons, have never been banned. They not\r\nonly are durable and effective, but are readily available\r\nfrom the countries that make them and the vast global\r\nnetwork of private arms dealers. All sorts of mines are also\r\neasy and relatively cheap to produce locally or elsewhere.\r\nThe land-mine has become a weapon of choice for many\r\narmies and resistance freedom-fighters around the world.\r\nMines along Cambodia’s roughly 700-kilometre border\r\nwith Thailand are so widespread that non-governmental\r\norganizations now rank them the country’s third most\r\nserious public-health hazard, after malaria and tuberculosis.\r\nLong before the creation of the Cambodian Mine-Action\r\nCentre — which is actually the Cambodian successor\r\nprogramme to the programme created under the United\r\nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) —\r\nCambodian villagers had no way of knowing where mines\r\nwere laid except when they were told by soldiers or those\r\nliving around previous battle zones that there was a heavy\r\nconcentration of mines around military bases, water sources\r\nand abandoned villages. Previously, no mapping or\r\nrecording of mines or mine incidents had been done. Local\r\npeople and agricultural workers were aware of mines, but\r\nthey nevertheless continued to be killed and maimed by\r\nthem.\r\nDuring the United Nations transitional period in\r\nCambodia, the Security Council mandated UNTAC to\r\ncarry out programmes of mine awareness, mine marking\r\nand mine clearing and training in mine clearance.\r\nFollowing UNTAC’s successful presence in Cambodia,\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was\r\ndesignated in November 1993 to undertake a support and\r\ncapacity-building role for the Cambodian Mine-Action\r\nCentre, with the backing of the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs. UNDP immediately began its\r\ntechnical assistance and capacity-building programme in\r\nCambodia. It supported the maintenance of the\r\nCambodian Mine-Action Centre’s four principal areas of\r\nde-mining responsibilities over a two-year period while at\r\nthe same time moving towards full Cambodian operation.\r\nIn Cambodia, it is estimated that mines are scattered\r\nin an area of 3,200 square kilometres of mostly\r\nagricultural and resettlement areas. A general mine survey\r\nwas recently conducted by the Cambodian Mine-Action\r\nCentre under the UNTAC mandate, covering 80 per cent\r\nof the country. It produced the following results: 1,851\r\nminefields have been registered in the database; over\r\n352,000 metres of minefield perimeters have been\r\nmarked; over 8 million square kilometres of area have\r\nbeen cleared; and over 20,000 anti-personnel mines, 132\r\nanti-tank mines and 132,000 unexploded ordnance devices\r\nhave been destroyed. About 30 per cent of the population\r\nat risk has received mine-awareness training through the\r\nCambodian Mine-Action Centre and other United Nations\r\nbodies and non-governmental organizations.\r\nMy Government is pleased with the result of the\r\nwork done by UNDP and various other international\r\norganizations, as well as foreign Governments, in close\r\ncooperation with the Cambodian Mine Action Centre, on\r\nthe problems of land-mines. The mine-clearance training\r\nunit has trained some 2,332 Cambodians as de-miners and\r\n99 as supervisors. Today, there are some 1,900 trained\r\nde-miners active in Cambodia, with 1,400 directly\r\nworking for the Cambodian Mine-Action Centre.\r\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia wishes to\r\nexpress its profound thanks and appreciation for the\r\ntireless efforts and dangerous work done every day by the\r\nstaff of La Compagnie francaise d’assistance specialisee,\r\nNorwegian People’s Aid, the International Labour\r\nOrganisation, the Halo Trust, the European Union,\r\nFondation Pro Victimis, United Kingdom ODA, and the\r\nUnited States State Department.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nMine clearance is indeed very expensive. It is\r\nestimated at present that more than $18 million will be\r\nspent in Cambodia within a two-year period, of which\r\n$9.1 million have already been received for the year 1994\r\nfrom the following donors: Australia, Canada, Denmark,\r\nJapan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United States of\r\nAmerica and the United Kingdom. The United States has\r\nprovided an additional $1.6 million for de-mining\r\nequipment, over 90 experts in the field of de-mining, and\r\nroad and bridge engineers under a separate arrangement\r\nwith the Cambodian Government. The Government of\r\nSweden has pledged $2.3 million. Belgium and Norway\r\nhave provided personnel, along with the countries I have\r\njust cited, as part of a technical advisory group.\r\nThough I am informing the Assembly today of this\r\npositive result in de-mining, last week the Khmer Rouge\r\ngroup once again laid mines in Siem Reap Province,\r\ncausing the deaths of two Cambodian de-miners working\r\nfor La Compagnie francaise d’assistance specialisee. The\r\nKhmer Rouge radio on Wednesday, 12 October\r\n1994,openly boasted about its fighters’ laying 100 new\r\nland-mines between 1 and 3 October along Route 10, which\r\nruns south from Battambang City. This is a serious threat\r\nto the well-being of the people.\r\nBut the will of the Cambodian people is strong. They\r\ncontinue to work hard for the development and\r\nrehabilitation of their country and allow no Khmer Rouge\r\nintimidation to frighten them away. Despite the on-and-off\r\nharassment of the destructive Khmer Rouge group, the\r\nsituation in Cambodia is improving from day to day. I\r\nexpress thanks to the General Assembly for this.\r\nMr. F. A. Khan (Pakistan): We are greatly heartened\r\nto see that the issue of uncleared land-mines has seized the\r\nattention of the international community and is being\r\ndiscussed with the seriousness it deserves.\r\nThis issue was considered for the first time in last\r\nyear’s session of the General Assembly. There has been\r\nsome forward movement since then in dealing with this\r\nissue. We are now more aware of the magnitude of the\r\nproblems posed by uncleared land-mines and the obstacles\r\nin the way of removing these mines. Some steps have\r\nalready been taken to overcome these obstacles, and there\r\nis increasing understanding of the further measures that\r\nneed to be taken.\r\nThe facts on the indiscriminate use of land-mines\r\nmake for grim reading. Over 110 million land-mines are\r\nspread over many parts of the world. More than 800\r\npeople, mostly innocent civilians, are killed every month\r\nby such mines. Food production in areas infested with\r\nland-mines has gone down dramatically. The physical\r\ninfrastructure of many countries — roads, power lines,\r\nirrigation systems — has been gravely affected.\r\nThese facts are not mere abstractions for us in\r\nPakistan. We have experienced firsthand the ravages of\r\nindiscriminate land-mine use. Thousands of Afghan\r\nrefugees injured by these mines have been treated in our\r\nmedical facilities. We are providing rehabilitation\r\ntreatment to many who have been maimed for life. We\r\nalso continue to host a huge number of refugees, many of\r\nwhom are unable to return to Afghanistan because of the\r\ndangers posed by uncleared mines. The line of control in\r\nJammu and Kashmir has also been heavily mined,\r\ncontrary to the 1949 Karachi cease-fire agreement. This\r\nhas created a great human tragedy.\r\nThe steps needed for successful mine clearance\r\nbecome clear with the identification of the impediments\r\nin the way of the removal of land-mines. The main\r\nimpediments are: the woefully limited mine-clearance\r\ncapacity of most States faced with this problem, lack of\r\ncoordination among various agencies involved in mine-\r\nclearance efforts, rudimentary mine-detection and mine-\r\nclearance technology and, above all, the abysmal level of\r\nfunding for mine clearance.\r\nMr. Yassin (Sudan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nWe are happy to note that some of the required steps\r\nfor effective mine clearance are already being taken.\r\nUnited Nations agencies are focusing on enhancing the\r\ncapacity of States to undertake mine-clearance activities.\r\nWhere the States are not in a position to take on this task,\r\neven with outside assistance, the non-governmental\r\norganizations have correctly been encouraged to\r\nparticipate. There are also increasing moves to coordinate\r\nand integrate efforts where multiple actors — non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, State authorities and United\r\nNations agencies — are involved in mine-clearance\r\nactivities. The designation within the United Nations of\r\nthe Department of Humanitarian Affairs as the focal point\r\nfor such activities will further help in integrating United\r\nNations efforts and in increasing coordination with other\r\norganizations in the field.\r\nWhile the organizational aspects of mine-clearance\r\nactivities are being addressed, there is not enough\r\nemphasis on upgrading mine-clearance and detection\r\ntechnology. It is not correct to say that the technical\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nproblems in the way of speedy and effective detection and\r\ndestruction of mines are insurmountable. In fact, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on “Assistance in mine clearance” reveals\r\nthat the technology to create a multi-sensor mine detector\r\nalready exists; only the engineering and software\r\nprogramming would be required. Nevertheless, the level\r\nand volume of research remains “too low and lacking in\r\npracticality” (A/49/357, para. 10). This is one area where\r\nfurther efforts could yield significant results.\r\nThe crucial area on which the ultimate success of\r\nmine-clearance activities depends is the provision of\r\nadequate funding. A useful start is being made by the\r\nestablishment of a voluntary trust fund for assistance in\r\nmine clearance. Two aspects of the fund need attention.\r\nFirst, where should the major contributions come\r\nfrom? This, in turn, raises the larger question of who bears\r\nthe responsibility for the removal of land-mines. We are of\r\nthe view that those who lay the land-mines must primarily\r\nbear the responsibility for their clearance. Parties that have\r\nwreaked havoc by indiscriminately spreading mines must\r\nnot be allowed to walk away from the scene of the carnage.\r\nThey should be made to pay for what they have wrought.\r\nThe other aspect of the fund that needs to be\r\nconsidered is the manner in which it will be administered\r\nand utilized. This issue will arise when the terms of\r\nreference of the fund are drawn up. We would suggest that,\r\nin addition to financing information and training\r\nprogrammes relating to mine clearance, the fund should be\r\nused to advance mine-clearance and mine-detection\r\ntechnology. This could be done by providing seed money\r\nfor initiating research activities and by arranging workshops\r\nthat bring together the results of research already being\r\nundertaken by different groups working in this field.\r\nThe question of the clearance of land-mines that have\r\nalready been laid needs to be distinguished from the issue\r\nof controlling the use of new land-mines. At one level these\r\nare undoubtedly related issues. If the use of land-mines is\r\nnot controlled, the task of mine clearance becomes almost\r\nimpossible. But the control of the use of land-mines raises\r\nissues that lie in the realm of arms control and\r\ndisarmament. These issues will quite correctly be dealt with\r\nin the First Committee.\r\nOur delegation will actively participate in the First\r\nCommittee deliberations on these issues. We shall be doing\r\nso with the objective of contributing to the evolution of a\r\ncomprehensive set of measures that will both control the\r\nuse of land-mines and help in their speedy clearance.\r\nMr. Ghebremariam (Eritrea): Three years ago\r\nEritrea emerged victorious from a devastating 30-year war\r\nof liberation. The war has ended, but the effects of war\r\ncontinue to haunt us. Among the major problems\r\nemerging as a direct byproduct of war is that of land-\r\nmines. The continued presence of more than 700,000\r\nmines throughout Eritrea — but particularly near farms,\r\nwater wells, irrigation systems, transport systems, bridges\r\nand other facilities — has become a major threat to the\r\nreconstruction, rehabilitation and development of the\r\ncountry. It has also been a major impediment to the\r\nresettlement of the large numbers of Eritrean refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons.\r\nIt is not easy to give the exact number of mines that\r\nwere planted during 30 years of war. It is estimated —\r\nand the estimate itself may be misleading — that no less\r\nthan 1 million anti-personnel mines may have been\r\nplanted. That is too many in a small country like Eritrea.\r\nTo date, Government experts have cleared about 300,000,\r\nbut much remains to be done. This is evident from the\r\nalmost daily land-mine accidents that are reported.\r\nStatistics show that there are about 750 deaths annually.\r\nThis has made the return to normal life extremely\r\ndifficult, since it has been made impossible to live in\r\nwhole regions in certain provinces. In areas where\r\nsettlement has been attempted, livestock are being lost,\r\nand children, women and farmers are being crippled or\r\nkilled. This, I must repeat, is making the resettlement of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons difficult. It also has a\r\ngrave psychological impact on the population.\r\nLand-mines are spread all over the country, although\r\nthere is a high concentration in only six of our nine\r\nprovinces and around strategic towns and sites.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the Government of Eritrea,\r\nduring the three years since liberation, has been doing\r\nwhatever it can with the means at its disposal, but it\r\nrecognizes its severe limitations. Its major needs are\r\ntechnical and financial, particularly in the areas of\r\ntraining, surveying, mine-clearing equipment, medical\r\nequipment, experienced medical personnel and adequate\r\nsupplies of artificial limbs.\r\nI wish finally to refer to the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session\r\non the work of the Organization, in which he wrote that\r\n“Of all the tasks involved in setting a nation on\r\na new road to peace and prosperity, perhaps none\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nhas the immediate urgency of mine clearance. ... [No]\r\nattempt to restore a sense of community and security\r\ncan succeed without effective land-mine removal”.\r\n(A/48/1, para.459)\r\nIt is for this reason that my Government appeals for\r\nassistance in clearing these instruments of war, which\r\ncontinue to wreak havoc long after the war has ended.\r\nMr. Bunnag (Thailand): On behalf of the Thai\r\ndelegation, I would like to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff for the very informative\r\nreport on assistance in mine clearance. This report is a grim\r\nreminder of the nature of land-mines and their effects on\r\nthe victims and their societies. The report contains good\r\nadvice to be taken into serious consideration whenever any\r\ncountry or anyone else wishes to buy, sell, produce or plant\r\nland-mines.\r\nWhen a draft resolution on assistance in mine\r\nclearance was first introduced by the European Union at the\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly, last year,\r\nThailand not only supported but also joined in sponsoring\r\nit, and we would not hesitate to do so again. For Thailand\r\nfully realizes that land-mines and other similar destructive\r\ndevices constitute a terrible threat to the safety, health and\r\nlives of the military as well as civilian populations,\r\nincluding personnel participating in humanitarian,\r\npeace-keeping, peace-building, rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction operations. We appreciate the magnitude of\r\nthe problem and have tried our utmost to assist others in\r\nthe matter.\r\nThe problem caused by land-mines and their after-\r\neffects cannot be overstated. Engineered to be deadly for\r\ndecades, uncleared land-mines, unlike other types of\r\nweapons, remain lethal long after a conflict has ceased.\r\nDesigned to kill, to injure, to impede movement, and to\r\nsow uncertainty and chaos during time of combat, land-\r\nmines continue to fulfil their destructive purposes until they\r\nare found and destroyed. They do not differentiate between\r\nmilitary and civilian, tanks and tractors, combatants and\r\nchildren.\r\nIt is devastating to learn from the report that the\r\nnumber of mines being laid each year outweighs the\r\nnumber of such mines that can be cleared during the same\r\nperiod. About 2 million new land-mines are being laid each\r\nyear, while only 100,000 were cleared last year, at a cost of\r\n$70 million to the international community. This means that\r\nevery three-dollar land-mine that is planted will cost\r\nbetween $300 and $1,000 to clear. There are approximately\r\n110 million land-mines currently planted in 64 countries\r\nin various parts of the world. It will be an extremely\r\ncostly operation to destroy them all — not only in terms\r\nof money and effort, but possibly in terms of lives as\r\nwell, not to mention the suffering they continue to wreak.\r\nAt present there are about a quarter of a million amputee\r\nmine victims needing care. Many more lives have been\r\nlost. The overall number of victims is expected to\r\nincrease by around 10,000 a year. Nor are the victims the\r\nonly ones to have to bear the suffering. The families of\r\nthe victims suffer just as much. This has far-reaching\r\nnegative effects on the societies of which these victims\r\nare members.\r\nWhen many of us were celebrating the conclusion of\r\nthe Paris Peace Accords on Cambodia and when the\r\nUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia was\r\nbeing formed, three years ago almost to the day, Thailand\r\nserved the international community by immediately\r\ndispatching two battalions of Royal Thai Army Engineers\r\ninto Cambodia, under bilateral agreement and also under\r\nUnited Nations auspices, to undertake mine clearance and\r\nroad rehabilitation. Their service has helped to open up\r\naccess and to clear the land to enable some 300,000\r\nKhmer refugees to go back home.\r\nAt present we are considering the request of the\r\nCambodian Mine Action Centre to provide further\r\nassistance in training. The Centre also requested 30\r\ntrained mine-clearing dogs as well as six trainers. The\r\ncost of this latest assistance will probably be borne by the\r\nRoyal Thai Government under our allocation for the\r\neconomic and technical assistance programme for\r\nCambodia, which totals 30 to 40 million baht this year. In\r\nthis connection, we are gratified to note that a United\r\nNations Voluntary Trust Fund for mine clearance is being\r\nestablished. This will help expedite mine clearance\r\nworldwide, and those with smaller resources can also\r\nbenefit.\r\nWith regard to the draft resolution before us, my\r\ndelegation shares its deep concern at the tremendous\r\nhumanitarian problems caused by the presence of mines\r\nand other unexploded devices that have serious and\r\nlasting social and economic consequences for the people\r\nof mine-infested countries. These humanitarian problems\r\nconstitute obstacles to the safe return of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons, to humanitarian-aid operations and to\r\nreconstruction and economic development, as well as to\r\nthe restoration of normalcy.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nWith regard to the draft resolution to be considered by\r\nthe Assembly, my delegation is convinced that it deserves\r\nour full support. In addition, we also believe the provisions\r\ncontained therein should be translated into tangible results.\r\nWe would like to urge all States, therefore, to strengthen\r\nrestrictions on the use of anti-personnel land-mines with a\r\nview to their total elimination; to render assistance to the\r\nvictims, their families, and their societies; to share all\r\ninformation of mine locations for mine clearance as well as\r\nother educational information regarding land-mines; to help\r\nin personnel training in mine-clearing and, lastly, to\r\ncontribute generously to the Voluntary Trust Fund.\r\nThailand attaches great importance to the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in mine-clearance activities. For this reason,\r\nThailand welcomes the appointment by the\r\nSecretary-General of a de-mining expert with an overall\r\ncoordinating role between the Departments of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs and Peace-keeping Operations. This will\r\ncomplement the establishment of the Voluntary Trust Fund\r\nby gathering and disseminating information, setting up\r\ntraining programmes relating to mine clearance and\r\nfacilitating the launching of mine-clearance operations.\r\nWe would therefore like to urge all Member States,\r\nregional organizations, governmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations and foundations to consider rendering full\r\ncooperation to the Secretary-General and the United Nations\r\nDepartments concerned in mine-clearance activities as\r\nmandated by the General Assembly. These activities are an\r\nimportant step for the international community in assisting\r\nnations to rid themselves of this barbaric scourge that\r\ncontinues to plague our planet.\r\nMr. Elaraby (Egypt): My delegation welcomes the\r\nconsideration by the General Assembly of the issue of\r\nassistance in mine clearance for the second consecutive\r\nyear and hopes that our affirmation of the importance of\r\nthis issue will be the catalyst for concerted action by the\r\ninternational community to eliminate this scourge.\r\nAs the report of the Secretary-General attests, the\r\nnature and scope of the problem are grim indeed. He\r\nreminds us that there are over 110 million mines left in the\r\naftermath of the conflicts in 64 countries and that they\r\ncontinue to claim 800 victims every month. Many of these\r\nmines predate 1945. Some of them are in the western sector\r\nof my own country. As if this were not enough, the\r\ncombined efforts of the international community were\r\ncapable last year of removing only a fraction of this vast\r\nnumber of indiscriminately laid mines.\r\nMoreover, it is often those in the most-disadvantaged\r\nsectors of the population who run the greatest risk of\r\nbeing wounded, killed, maimed or permanently disfigured\r\nby mines. The intense suffering inflicted upon the very\r\nhigh numbers of innocent victims of mines, primarily\r\namong the civilian population, is an affront to the\r\nconscience of mankind.\r\nThe broad parameters of this problem, which must\r\nbe confronted by the United Nations, its agencies, its\r\nMember States and non-governmental organizations,\r\nnecessitates an encompassing and comprehensive\r\napproach to achieve the requisite coordination and address\r\nthe operational, financial and legal aspects of this issue.\r\nEgypt welcomes the designation of the Department\r\nof Humanitarian Affairs as the focal point within the\r\nUnited Nations responsible for coordinating de-mining\r\nactivities and the creation of a mine action unit within the\r\nsame Department. The inclusion of mine clearance in the\r\nmandates of some peace-keeping operations is a welcome\r\nstep which should be taken further to emphasize\r\nde-mining efforts in the terms of reference of all relevant\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nThe United Nations, its agencies and Member States\r\ncan also contribute in setting up institutional mechanisms\r\nfor the exchange of information and expertise as well as\r\nthe training of personnel in mine-clearance techniques and\r\nconducting joint mine-clearance efforts with regional and\r\nnational authorities.\r\nThe establishment of a Voluntary Trust Fund to\r\nfinance information and training programmes relating to\r\nmine clearance is an important step forward, but it will\r\nnot be sufficient in itself to meet the cost of removing the\r\nover 100 million mines laid throughout the world. We\r\nurge all Governments to contribute to the Fund while\r\nstressing the responsibility of those who have laid the\r\nland-mines for their clearance.\r\nEgypt is a signatory of the 1981 inhumane weapons\r\nConvention. We welcome the work of the Group of\r\nExperts preparing for the review of that Convention and\r\nhope that those efforts will ultimately contribute to\r\nstrengthening existing humanitarian laws against the\r\nindiscriminate use of land-mines.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 26 October 1994\r\nFinally, it is important to note that de-mining is not a\r\npanacea for the global problem of uncleared mines.\r\nUniversal regulation of the use, transfer and ultimately the\r\nproduction of land-mines offers the humane and practical\r\nsolution. It is also necessary to take steps to strengthen the\r\nlegal sanctions against the indiscriminate use of land-mines\r\nand the application of the principle of responsibility to the\r\nStates and parties responsible for the indiscriminate laying\r\nof mines.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in the\r\ndebate on this item. I should like to inform members that\r\naction on the draft resolution, as amended, will be taken at\r\na later date to be announced in the Journal.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\nAnnex\r\nChanges in record and/or roll-call votes\r\nResolution 49/9\r\nSubsequent to the voting, the delegation of Lesotho\r\nadvised the Secretariat that it had intended to vote in\r\nfavour.\r\n23\r\n"
