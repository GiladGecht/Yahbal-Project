(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 10\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/49/1)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I should\r\nlike to propose that the list of speakers in the debate on this\r\nitem be closed today at 11 a.m.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\ntherefore request those representatives wishing to participate\r\nin the debate to inscribe their names on the list as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nMr. Camacho Omiste (Bolivia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Bolivian delegation is pleased to initiate our\r\nconsideration of the report presented by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn the course of our debate the Ambassador of\r\nIndonesia will report on the joint views of the Movement\r\nof Non-Aligned Countries, of which Bolivia is honoured to\r\nbe a member. Bolivia’s position will be clearly reflected in\r\nhis statement, and I would like to express special thanks to\r\nAmbassador Nugroho Wisnumurti for this. I shall therefore\r\nconfine myself to a few matters of particular importance to\r\nthe Government I represent.\r\nAmong the wide range of issues and the volume of\r\npapers relating to the agenda of this session, the\r\nSecretary-General’s report gives an overview of the\r\nOrganization’s activities and allows us to appreciate,\r\nglobally, the essential links between various tasks. It is\r\nthus quite clear that these actions are not isolated and\r\nmakeshift but, on the contrary, reflect the implementation\r\nof a clearly designed strategy.\r\nThe confidence placed by the international\r\ncommunity in the Secretary-General on his election has\r\nbeen fully justified, and I extend to him my delegation’s\r\ncongratulations on that.\r\nWe are particularly pleased that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report pays due importance to development\r\nissues. Preventive diplomacy and the settlement of\r\ndisputes will have solid bases to the extent that mankind\r\nis in a position to implement policies to bring about\r\neffective cooperation permitting us to address collectively\r\nthe full exercise of human rights and the problems of\r\npoverty and unemployment. The Agenda for Development\r\nshould reflect these views, which are shared by the\r\nmajority of States represented here.\r\nBolivia is carrying out a number of new projects on\r\nsuch matters as sustainable development, regional\r\nintegration, liberalization of trade and investment,\r\nprotection of the environment, advancement of indigenous\r\npeoples, participation of the public, the fight against drug\r\ntrafficking and other equally important issues.\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nHowever, national endeavours have often not met with\r\ninternational understanding to the extent that we would\r\nhave expected. Those involved in bilateral and multilateral\r\ncooperation, especially financial organizations, should take\r\ninto account in their operational policies elements of\r\nnational projects that have a bearing on the collective\r\ninterest of nations. It is therefore paradoxical that, for\r\nexample, the United Nations Development Programme has\r\nexperienced a 15 per cent reduction in its basic resources\r\nand that the United Nations Children’s Fund faces a huge\r\nshortfall in contributions, as is mentioned in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report.\r\nThe Bolivian Government and people are seriously and\r\nfirmly committed to international efforts to combat illicit\r\ndrugs. In his statement in the general debate, Foreign\r\nMinister Antonio Araníbar Quiroga called for a broad\r\nunderstanding of the issues, which would allow for a proper\r\nappreciation of the traditional medicinal and cultural uses\r\nof the coca leaf, clearly distinguished from cocaine, the\r\ndemand for which in developed countries creates countless\r\nproblems.\r\nSimilarly, at the beginning of the International Decade\r\nof the World’s Indigenous People we will submit to the\r\nrelevant Commission the report of the meeting that took\r\nplace in the middle of this year in Cochabamba between\r\nLatin American Government officials and representatives of\r\nthe indigenous peoples of our continent, so that the relevant\r\nplan of action will become operational and will meet the\r\nneeds and demands of those intended to benefit from it.\r\nRegarding the struggle for human rights, Bolivia\r\ncongratulates the High Commissioner for Human Rights,\r\nAmbassador José Ayala Lasso, on his work. My country\r\nhas made significant contributions through its own process\r\nof democratic consolidation. Similarly, together with other\r\nStates we are contributing police personnel for monitoring\r\nand to provide training in the Republics of Mozambique\r\nand Haiti.\r\nWe should also mention in this connection that Bolivia\r\nis one of the few States today in which a former dictator,\r\naccused of grave violations of constitutional order and of\r\nhuman rights, has been put on trial, with all legal\r\nguarantees at every level of the process. His sentence will\r\nbe served in Bolivia, thanks to proper implementation of\r\nthe extradition treaty by the administrative bodies of our\r\nsister republic of Brazil and thanks to the proper\r\nfunctioning of the international system of judicial\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn our commitment to the principles of justice, we in\r\nBolivia would like to commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations by reiterating in deeds\r\nand not merely in words our commitment to international\r\nlaw. As my country’s Foreign Minister has stated, we are\r\nconfident that in the third millennium the law will cease\r\nto be an instrument used by the powerful to support\r\ninjustices and will become the sole effective means for\r\nsettling disputes and rectifying, whenever necessary, the\r\nexcesses and errors of previous generations, to ensure that\r\neffective international justice prevails.\r\nWith respect to reform of the Charter and the\r\nfunctioning of the Organization’s main organs, my\r\nGovernment believes that democracy must also become a\r\nclear expression of international relations. The\r\nparticipation of large and small States in solutions of\r\nissues that are binding on all should be fair, representative\r\nand not, as is usually the case, merely rhetorical.\r\nIn particular, we share the view expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General at the end of his report that the United\r\nNations\r\n“is the repository of hope for humanity and the\r\nfuture. That hope deserves our deepest continuing\r\ncommitment.” (A/49/1, para. 797)\r\nMr. Wisnumurti (Indonesia): It is indeed an\r\nhonour and privilege for me to speak on behalf of the\r\nnon-aligned countries with regard to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the work of the Organization.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to express our\r\nsincere appreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive and insightful report. We trust that it will\r\ngreatly facilitate our deliberations on improving and\r\nenhancing the functioning of the United Nations.\r\nAmong the basic purposes in founding the United\r\nNations almost 50 years ago were those of saving\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war, of\r\nreaffirming faith in human rights and the dignity of\r\nmankind, of establishing an environment for respect of\r\ninternational law, and of promoting social progress and\r\nbetter standards of living in larger freedom for all. Thus,\r\nin his third annual report to the General Assembly on the\r\nwork of the Organization, contained in document A/49/1,\r\nthe Secretary-General has rightly focused his attention on\r\nthe economic and social questions that have for so long\r\nbeen sidelined. These have become all the more important\r\ntoday precisely because it has become increasingly\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nrecognized that conflicts have economic and social origins.\r\nWe therefore firmly believe that the emerging consensus on\r\nhuman-centred development should go a long way towards\r\nstrengthening the ability of the United Nations to realize its\r\nvision of development.\r\nWe, the non-aligned countries, can fully agree that, as\r\nthe United Nations completes the first half-century of its\r\nwork and stands poised to meet the challenges of the future,\r\nits primary mission will be to fulfil a renewed vision and\r\ncommitment to development as the long-term solution to\r\nconflicts which endanger international peace and security\r\nand thereby be better positioned to address their root\r\ncauses. It is therefore a matter of grave concern that, as\r\nindicated in the report, while the United Nations is called\r\nupon to shoulder ever-expanding responsibilities, it is at the\r\nsame time being shackled by a deepening financial\r\nproblem. As the report notes poignantly:\r\n“the unpredictability and irregularity of contributions\r\nfrom Member States make it extremely difficult to\r\nmanage the Organization effectively.” (A/49/1,\r\npara. 103)\r\nIf this perennial question is not quickly resolved, the\r\nconsequences could be disastrous to the aspirations of the\r\ninternational community to peace and development.\r\nTherefore, the contributions of Members should be paid on\r\ntime and in full in order to alleviate this difficulty. As we\r\napproach the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization, the\r\nquestion of financing should be given top priority so that\r\nthe United Nations can be put on a more financially secure\r\nfooting.\r\nThe non-aligned countries are fully committed to\r\nmaking the United Nations the central instrument for a new\r\nand revitalized international order. Steps must therefore be\r\ntaken to ensure its fidelity to the dynamics of democracy in\r\nits functioning — namely, the fullest participation,\r\nconsultation and engagement of all its Members in the work\r\nof the Organization.\r\nThe non-aligned countries hold that balance is\r\nessential in the relationship between the General Assembly\r\nand other principal organs, including the Security Council,\r\nin conformity with their respective mandates as enshrined\r\nin the Charter. The wide-ranging and comprehensive role of\r\nthe General Assembly in world affairs alluded to in the\r\nreport is fully consistent with the principle of sovereign\r\nequality and the right of all States to participate in the\r\nAssembly’s deliberations and decision-making on issues\r\nof global concern. The Movement is also committed to\r\nplaying an active role in the ongoing consultations on\r\nimproving the Assembly’s working methods and the\r\nrationalization of its agenda in order to enhance its\r\nefficiency and effectiveness.\r\nBecause of under-representation, the Movement has\r\nevinced keen interest in the question of expanding\r\nSecurity Council membership, particularly in the light of\r\nprofound changes on the international scene and also due\r\nto the universal character of the Organization. The issues\r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council are of paramount\r\nimportance for the non-aligned countries. Hence, the\r\nMovement deems it essential substantially to increase the\r\nproportion of members of the Security Council belonging\r\nto the Movement and other developing countries. Any\r\npredetermined selection excluding the non-aligned and\r\nother developing countries would be unacceptable to the\r\nMovement.\r\nIt is also essential to reaffirm that both the expansion\r\nand reform aspects of the Security Council, including its\r\ndecision-making processes and procedures, should be\r\nexamined as integral parts of a common package, taking\r\ninto account the principles of sovereign equality of States,\r\nequitable geographic distribution and the need for\r\ntransparency, accountability and democratization. In this\r\ncontext, we encourage the endeavours of the Working\r\nGroup established by the Security Council, which we\r\nhope will also contribute to enhancing its working\r\nrelationship with the General Assembly.\r\nThe non-aligned countries are concerned over the\r\ntendency of the Council to deal with certain issues that\r\nare inconsistent with the provisions of the Charter\r\nconcerning its role, and thereby to encroach upon the\r\nprerogatives and jurisdiction of the General Assembly and\r\nits subsidiary bodies. It is self-evident that questions\r\nrelating to human rights fall within the competence of the\r\nGeneral Assembly through its Third Committee. Likewise,\r\nquestions of humanitarian assistance should also be dealt\r\nwith by the Assembly and the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees. In this context,\r\nwe are further concerned over certain aspects of the\r\nrestructuring of the Secretariat of the United Nations that\r\nstrengthen the tendency to such encroachment. In our\r\nview, therefore, the restructuring of the Secretariat of the\r\nUnited Nations should be reviewed by the General\r\nAssembly and completed as early as possible, in\r\naccordance with the legislative mandate of the Assembly.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nThe non-aligned countries recall the first-ever summit\r\nmeeting of the Security Council, held in January 1992, and\r\nwelcome the fact that a second summit meeting will be\r\nheld in January 1995. We look forward to the forthcoming\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly at the Heads of State or\r\nGovernment level, in October 1995, to commemorate the\r\nhistoric occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn view of the Organization’s steadily expanding role\r\nin peace-keeping operations, the search for ways and means\r\nto ensure broader and more stable support for these\r\nactivities has become imperative. While all aspects of the\r\nUnited Nations have faced financial constraints in recent\r\nyears, none has been so severely affected as its peace-\r\nkeeping missions. There can be no doubt that the current\r\narrangements for financing these activities are inadequate\r\nand unreliable. They place the heaviest burden on the\r\nnon-aligned countries that contribute troops, thus\r\ndiscouraging participation. Such constraints have also\r\nseverely limited the capabilities of the United Nations to\r\nprevent and contain violence and resolve conflicts\r\npeacefully; they even threaten peace settlements that have\r\nbeen negotiated.\r\nThe non-aligned countries, therefore, consider it\r\nnecessary to address the problems of reimbursing troop\r\ncosts and compensating participating countries, especially\r\nthe developing countries. They called for contributions to\r\nthe cost of peace-keeping, in accordance with the existing\r\nspecial scale of assessments established by resolution\r\n3101 (XXVIII), which duly takes into account the special\r\nresponsibilities of the five permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council and economic considerations. These\r\narrangements should be institutionalized and must be in\r\naccordance with Article 17 (2) of the Charter.\r\nThe eleventh ministerial conference of non-aligned\r\ncountries, held in Cairo last summer, recognized the\r\nimportance of peace-keeping operations for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security and spelled out a number\r\nof guiding principles. These principles include, inter alia:\r\nFirst, there should be strict adherence to the principles\r\nand purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations, and in particular to the principles of full respect\r\nfor the sovereignty and sovereign equality of all States,\r\nterritorial integrity and non-intervention in internal affairs.\r\nSecond, peace-keeping operations should be of a\r\nnon-intrusive and non-interventionist nature. They should be\r\nmandated at the request of the Member States involved.\r\nThird, peace-keeping operations should be of an impartial\r\nnature. Fourth, there should be full transparency and\r\nappropriate consultations in the process leading to the\r\nestablishment of a peace-keeping operation, particularly\r\nbetween the troop-contributing countries and the Security\r\nCouncil. Fifth, peace-keeping operations should be\r\nestablished with a clear mandate, time frame, clear\r\nobjectives, rules of engagement, secured financing and\r\nadequate resources. Sixth, the resources for peace-\r\nkeeping activities should not be allocated at the expense\r\nof resources for the development activities of the United\r\nNations. And, seventh, equitable opportunities should be\r\nensured to facilitate the widest possible participation of\r\nMember States, in particular the developing countries, in\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nAs the report rightly notes, fruitful cooperation has\r\nbeen established between the United Nations and various\r\nregional organizations, which have acted as partners in\r\nfacilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts. It is\r\ntherefore heartening that within the framework of existing\r\nregional institutions, commensurate with their respective\r\ncharters and mandates, interaction with global\r\norganizations and multilateral forums such as the United\r\nNations has been strengthened. None the less, the resort\r\nto regionalism has not diminished the need for an\r\neffective global framework to strengthen international\r\ncooperation within the context of the Charter. It is clear\r\nthat, in our interdependent world, regional efforts can\r\nonly supplement, and cannot supplant, the United Nations\r\nin meeting its global responsibilities.\r\nConsequently, what is called for is a thorough\r\nexploration of possible mechanisms and procedures that\r\nwould strengthen the interaction between the United\r\nNations and various regional organizations and\r\narrangements in the political, security, economic, social\r\nand other fields of endeavour, consistent with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations.\r\nAs to the regional approach to disarmament, the\r\nMovement is gratified to note that the goal of a\r\ndenuclearized Africa is within reach. The success of the\r\nLatin American countries towards the full implementation\r\nof the Treaty of Tlatelolco will render the region nuclear\r\nfree. Taken together, they will become integral parts of a\r\nnuclear-free world, which will make a significant\r\ncontribution to non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.\r\nIn general, the non-aligned countries believe that global\r\nand regional approaches to disarmament complement each\r\nother and should be pursued simultaneously.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nWith regard to other disarmament issues identified in\r\nthe report, it is pertinent to note that, despite the\r\nunanimously adopted General Assembly resolution 48/70 on\r\na comprehensive test ban, negotiations in the Conference on\r\nDisarmament have encountered formidable difficulties. The\r\nreal cause of the stalemate is adherence to untenable\r\napproaches to disarmament in the post-cold-war era.\r\nObviously, if the expectations of the international\r\ncommunity are to be fulfilled, the Conference on\r\nDisarmament will have to intensify its efforts, with a\r\nserious political commitment by all the nuclear-weapon\r\nStates, in the concerted endeavours towards the agreed goal\r\nof a comprehensive test ban.\r\nA treaty in this regard will be an effective instrument\r\ntowards the non-proliferation and elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons. While recognizing its pivotal role in preventing\r\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons, attention should also\r\nbe focused on those areas where serious concerns have\r\ncontinued to be expressed. Questions have constantly been\r\nraised as to the commitment by the nuclear Powers to the\r\nfulfilment of their obligations. Many other issues,\r\nincluding, inter alia, unhindered access to nuclear\r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes and security assurances to\r\nnon-nuclear States have remained unresolved. It is up to the\r\n1995 review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to determine the\r\nlongevity of that Treaty.\r\nAs is now increasingly recognized, durable peace and\r\nstability cannot be achieved in the absence of sustained\r\neconomic growth and development. Yet, as pointed out by\r\nthe Secretary-General, while there has been some progress\r\ntowards peace and conflict management, there has been\r\nlittle concerted action towards development. The\r\nnon-aligned countries therefore welcome the renewed\r\nemphasis accorded to development in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. It stresses the need to promote\r\ndevelopment in its multiple dimensions. In this regard, we\r\nwould like to emphasize that sustained economic growth is\r\ncentral to development, bearing in mind the priorities of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn the context of bringing development to the forefront\r\nof the international agenda, we also welcome the focus of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s work on \"An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment\" in order to maximize the capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations to facilitate and promote efforts to attain\r\nsustained economic growth and development. The\r\nNon-Aligned Movement sees the elaboration and adoption\r\nof the Agenda as an essential means for correcting the\r\nperennial imbalances and inequities in the world economy,\r\nwhich have persistently hampered the development efforts\r\nof the developing countries. To this end, \"An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment\" should first of all specifically identify its\r\nfundamental objectives, which, the non-aligned countries\r\nbelieve, promote sustained economic growth and\r\nsustainable development, including the eradication of\r\npoverty, and seek the equitable functioning of the world\r\neconomy. It should also strengthen the role of the United\r\nNations in promoting economic growth and development.\r\nThe non-aligned countries, furthermore, strongly\r\nbelieve that the Agenda should, as was called for at the\r\nWorld Hearings on Development and the high-level\r\nsegment of the Economic and Social Council earlier this\r\nyear, be action-oriented and should present an overall\r\nintegrated and comprehensive policy framework for\r\nadvocating effective ways and means of promoting and\r\nstrengthening cooperation for development. We also\r\nbelieve that the Agenda should avoid advancing new\r\nconcepts which do not command general acceptability.\r\nEqually important is that the Agenda should advance\r\nthe equitable functioning of the world economy. To\r\nfacilitate this, the Agenda should concentrate on the\r\nconcrete aspects of interdependence that are considered\r\nmutually beneficial and which should help to secure a\r\nconstructive dialogue and genuine partnership among all\r\ncountries and other actors in the promotion of\r\ndevelopment cooperation between the developed and\r\ndeveloping countries. This should be pursued in\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 48/165 on\r\nthe renewal of the dialogue on strengthening economic\r\ncooperation for development through partnership.\r\nMoreover, the report of the Secretary-General on ways\r\nand means of advancing such a dialogue and partnership\r\nshould further facilitate our endeavours to establish a\r\nsound and action-oriented Agenda for Development.\r\nThe deliberations on the forthcoming report on the\r\nagenda, like those at the recent Cairo Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, will constitute a clear test\r\nof the commitment to a constructive dialogue based on\r\nmutual interests and benefits, genuine interdependence,\r\nshared responsibility and partnership, as set out in\r\nresolution 48/165. As a complement to the North-South\r\ndialogue, there is a dire need to intensify South-South\r\ncooperation for the promotion of development. In this\r\nregard, we regret to note that such activities were not\r\nhighlighted in the report of the Secretary-General.\r\nWe are also rather disappointed that the issue of\r\nexternal indebtedness, which remains at crisis levels for\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nmany developing countries, has not merited comment in the\r\nreport. The non-aligned countries continue to attach great\r\nimportance to this debilitating constraint on their\r\ndevelopment. While aggregate debt indicators have indeed\r\nimproved, there is still something basically lacking or\r\nmissing in the present approaches. Therefore, there is a\r\nneed for an innovative approach that would include, inter\r\nalia, a once-and-for-all arrangement for settling outstanding\r\ndebt and the application of debt reduction to all categories\r\nof debt, including multilateral debt, so as to provide\r\ncountries with a renewed chance to generate economic\r\ngrowth and to advance their development.\r\nAs to the question of improving the United Nations\r\nmachinery for development, we agree that system-wide\r\nfield-level cooperation and coordination are of major\r\nimportance. At the same time, as pointed out in the report,\r\nno matter how good the coherence and coordination of the\r\noperational activities may become, the Organization cannot\r\nfulfil its mandate without adequate and stable resources.\r\nThus, the non-aligned countries find it paradoxical that,\r\nwhile the international community is attaching greater\r\nimportance than ever before to the close linkages between\r\npeace and development, the resources for the development\r\nactivities of the United Nations system have actually been\r\ndeclining. At the same time, we note that the resources for\r\npeace-keeping operations continue to increase. Therefore,\r\nwe consider it important to mobilize new and additional\r\nresources for development from all available funding\r\nsources and mechanisms, and we call on the international\r\ncommunity to honour its commitments with respect to\r\nincreasing financial support for development activities.\r\nThe various activities undertaken by the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights are adequately reflected\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report. The non-aligned countries\r\nparticipated in shaping the mandate of the Office of the\r\nHigh Commissioner and, I am pleased to note, are generally\r\nsatisfied with the manner in which that mandate has been\r\nexercised during the first year of operation. The dialogue in\r\nwhich the High Commissioner has engaged various\r\nGovernments is consistent with the position of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement that cooperation, and not confrontation,\r\nshould guide our actions in this field.\r\nThe Secretary-General calls for strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations capacity for preventive action to avoid\r\nhuman-rights violations. In that context, however, the non-\r\naligned countries would like to recall that the World\r\nConference on Human Rights considered that the existence\r\nof widespread and extreme poverty inhibited the full and\r\neffective enjoyment of human rights and that its immediate\r\nalleviation and eventual elimination must remain a high\r\npriority for the international community. If preventive\r\naction were to be taken to redress poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment, it would, we believe, lay a solid\r\nfoundation for securing respect of the broader spectrum\r\nof human rights. Furthermore, the non-aligned countries\r\nwish to note that what is required, first and foremost, is\r\nto make optimal use of existing human rights bodies by\r\nreviewing their procedures with a view to avoiding\r\nunnecessary overlap of activities.\r\nFinally, much of the credit for sustaining the efforts\r\ntowards finding peaceful and just solutions to the various\r\nconflict situations around the globe, as well as for\r\nimbuing economic development with renewed focus and\r\nimportance, should go to the United Nations, the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff. As a result of their work,\r\nwe are now witnessing a renewal of faith in the role of\r\nthe United Nations as the unique multilateral framework\r\nfor peace and development as well as for harmonizing the\r\nactions of nations as provided for in the Charter. It is now\r\nfor us to fully utilize the inherent potentials of our\r\nOrganization in collectively advancing our shared\r\naspirations for just peace, common security and equitable\r\nprosperity for all.\r\nMrs. Hassan (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAt the outset, the Egyptian delegation wishes to extend\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General on his\r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/49/1). The report describes the activities of the United\r\nNations in various fields over the past 12 months and\r\ndetails the major developments that have accompanied\r\nthose activities.\r\nIn our view, the annual consideration of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, which we consider to be a\r\nhealthy tradition, is not confined to reviewing the\r\nOrganization’s activities, evaluating its achievements and\r\nidentifying its failures, but is also an occasion wherein we\r\nmay consider the future direction and prospects of its\r\nwork.\r\nToday’s debate is of particular importance in view\r\nof the vital role played by the United Nations in a\r\nchanging world situation that, more than ever before, calls\r\nfor the intensification of multilateral action to meet the\r\ngreat challenges before us and to realize the hopes and\r\nexpectations of Member States.\r\nThe Permanent Representative of Indonesia spoke a\r\nfew minutes ago of many of the report’s important points,\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nand we associate ourselves with what he said on behalf of\r\nthe non-aligned countries. I shall confine myself in this\r\nstatement to certain other questions of particular\r\nimportance.\r\nIn reviewing the sources of conflict in the world, the\r\nreport makes clear the organic link between international\r\npeace and security on the one hand and development on the\r\nother. It identifies three foundations of peace: development\r\nfirst and foremost, humanitarian action and human rights.\r\nThe sources of conflict in the world are no longer purely\r\nmilitary. The roots of conflict are to be found also in the\r\nsevere economic and social problems which beset the\r\nmajority of the world’s peoples. The reality of this epoch\r\nwherein international relations are evolving, and taking\r\nshape against the backdrop of conflicting and overlapping\r\ninterests and explosive crises created by ethnic differences\r\nand fragmented nationalisms, underscores the\r\nmultidimensional nature of the problems and challenges\r\nfacing our world, and reflects the interrelationship between\r\nthe various elements of the concept of security. Non-\r\nmilitary threats to security, particularly poverty, famine,\r\nunemployment and natural disasters, are all fundamental\r\ncauses of destabilization and threats to peace.\r\nThe Organization has been criticized recently for\r\nallegedly devoting the larger part of its efforts to peace-\r\nkeeping at the expense of economic and social questions.\r\nThe report, in its Introduction, admits this:\r\n“while we have seen some progress towards peace and\r\nconflict management, we have seen little concerted\r\naction towards development.” (A/49/1, para. 4)\r\nTherefore, a renewed and strengthened United Nations\r\ncommitment to work in the economic and social fields, as\r\nthe Secretary-General states in his report, is not only an end\r\nin itself but is also the means of attending to the sources of\r\nconflicts.\r\nIn this connection, the Secretary-General proposes a\r\nnew definition of the concept of development which\r\ninvolves five interlinked dimensions of development,\r\nnamely, peace, the economy, the environment, society and\r\ndemocracy. We believe that these five dimensions\r\nsuccinctly sum up the major challenges of our time. They\r\nare interlinked and they mutually reinforce each other. In\r\nthis respect, the Secretary-General correctly states that\r\nvigorous multilateral action is required to incorporate and\r\nintegrate those five dimensions and that such action calls\r\nfor an integrated approach by the United Nations and\r\npolitical commitment on the part of its Member States.\r\nWe were gratified to see the interest in according a\r\nhigh priority to the “Agenda for Development” in\r\ninternational concerns. We look forward to participating\r\nin its consideration in the hope that an agreed and feasible\r\nframework may be developed for facing up to the\r\nchallenges which confront us and meeting all our\r\nexpectations. It is high time that the Organization’s\r\nenergy was turned to development and to give new\r\nmomentum and strength to the United Nations work\r\ntowards establishing more just and more equitable\r\ninternational relations. The clear link between peace and\r\ndevelopment cannot be overemphasized and it forms the\r\nmain theme of “An Agenda for Development”.\r\nIn our view, the Secretary-General’s call for an\r\nintegrated approach to human-rights questions, which\r\nhave become one of the Organization’s new priorities, is\r\na natural extension of the recognition by the Vienna\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights of the right to\r\ndevelopment. It is of great importance that our joint\r\nefforts be directed to the full implementation of this\r\nfundamental right in the interest of the peoples of the\r\nthird world.\r\nWe cannot deny that the past year was marked by a\r\ngreat increase in the Organization’s activities in the field\r\nof peace-keeping and peacemaking. The Organization’s\r\nrole in preventive diplomacy and post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding has also grown. The increase in resorting to the\r\nUnited Nations and its presence in the field has been\r\naccompanied by a need to consider institutional and\r\norganizational measures that might be taken to improve\r\nthe Organization’s ability to conceive, plan and manage\r\npeace-keeping operations. We deem it necessary that the\r\nlessons learned from experience in the field be evaluated\r\nin all their various aspects periodically.\r\nAnother important consideration with regard to\r\npeace-keeping operations is that States that participate in\r\nsuch operations do so as part of their commitments under\r\nthe Charter and with a view to mitigating human\r\nsuffering. In so doing, those States have to bear the\r\nfinancial burden as troop contributors to United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations. Great hardship is imposed on\r\nthose States when the expenditures they have incurred are\r\nnot quickly and fully reimbursed. This situation must be\r\ndecisively and swiftly remedied if the principal of the\r\nuniversality of participation in peace-keeping operations\r\nis to be maintained.\r\nIn addition, the increasing tendency to finance the\r\nsupport activities of peace-keeping operations from the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nregular United Nations budget is a procedure that needs to\r\nbe reviewed rather than institutionalized, especially in view\r\nof the fact that the regular budget has been in a zero\r\ngrowth situation since 1992. The Egyptian delegation has\r\noften called for the financing of peace-keeping support\r\nactivities from the budgets for such operations or from the\r\npeace-keeping support account. Action must be taken in this\r\nmatter so that the scarce and diminishing resources of the\r\nregular budget may be devoted to financing priority\r\nactivities, in particular those linked with the economic\r\ndevelopment of developing countries and the economic\r\nrecovery of Africa.\r\nMy delegation shares the concern repeatedly expressed\r\nby the Secretary-General in his annual report at the\r\nworsening financial crisis of the Organization as a result of\r\nthe large arrears of Member States in paying assessed\r\ncontributions. The report makes clear that the failure of\r\nMember States to pay assessed contributions in full and on\r\ntime places the Organization in a difficult financial\r\nsituation, deprives it of a sound financial base and makes\r\neffective management extremely difficult. Continued failure\r\nwill have negative consequences for the international\r\ncommunity’s expectations with regard to peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Secretary-General has put forward a number of\r\nproposals to encourage States to meet their legal\r\ncommitments fully. We share his opinion that there is a\r\npressing need to arrive at a swift solution to this crisis.\r\nI should now like to refer briefly to the various organs\r\nof the United Nations. The Secretariat is an international\r\ncivil service body. Like any bureaucracy, it must exercise\r\nself-criticism and evaluate the manner in which it intends\r\nto face the challenges of the future. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the steps taken by the Secretary-General to\r\nachieve efficiency, minimize waste, increase accountability\r\nand eliminate corruption.\r\nWe acknowledge the need to develop administrative\r\nand leadership qualities within the Secretariat and, in this\r\nconnection, we welcome the initiation of a comprehensive\r\nprogramme of management training aimed at modernizing\r\nand increasing the efficiency of the Organization.\r\nI should like to underscore the importance of General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/264 regarding the revitalization of\r\nthe work of the General Assembly as the principal universal\r\nbody with a mandate to adopt resolutions concerning the\r\nmanagement of the Organization and the establishment of\r\nits priorities. It also stressed the importance of a balanced\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nvarious organs of the United Nations, in particular the\r\nSecurity Council, in consonance with the General\r\nAssembly’s mandate under the Charter.\r\nAnd here, I cannot fail to touch on a very important\r\nsubject, namely, reform of the Security Council. The\r\nCouncil’s clear lack of representative character has begun\r\nto affect its legitimacy, and it is in no one’s interest to\r\npermit the gradual erosion of the Security Council’s\r\ncredibility.\r\nTherefore, in this regard, my delegation believes that\r\nin order to achieve the democratization of the Security\r\nCouncil in the context of the overall reform of the United\r\nNations aimed at greater democracy and transparency in\r\nall the organs of the Organization, the serious and active\r\nwork of the Working Group on the increase in the\r\nCouncil’s membership and the reform of its rules of\r\nprocedure, particularly its decision-making methods, must\r\ncontinue. We hope that a decision in this regard will be\r\nreached before the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nestablishment of the Organization.\r\nMr. Melamed (Israel): I wish to congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your unanimous election to preside over the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that your vast\r\ndiplomatic experience will be invaluable in guiding the\r\nAssembly.\r\nI also wish to extend my congratulations to the\r\nformer President, Mr. Samuel Insanally, and to\r\ncompliment him on his skilful direction of the Assembly’s\r\naffairs.\r\nI would like to express Israel’s appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization. We were pleased to note the emphasis\r\ngiven to coordinating a comprehensive strategy to respond\r\nto today’s challenges. Such an integrated approach is\r\nrendered necessary by the existing interrelationship\r\nbetween peace, security and development.\r\nThe resurgence of ethnic, religious, tribal and\r\nnational conflicts has caused enormous carnage and\r\nuntold human suffering. We would like to see more\r\nattention and resources devoted to early identification of\r\nthe warning signs of trouble in order to prevent\r\nsmouldering conflicts from igniting into full-blown\r\nconfrontations. It is our belief that in the long run such a\r\ncourse of action would prove more effective and efficient\r\nthan emergency operations conducted after the outbreak\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nof hostilities. Consequently, Israel fully supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s statement that\r\n\"The United Nations must renew and strengthen its\r\ncommitment to work in the economic and social fields\r\nas an end in itself and as the means of attending to the\r\nsources of conflicts.\" (A/49/1, para. 4)\r\nInasmuch as the major threats to peace and security\r\nare not limited by geographic or political borders, we\r\nbelieve that particular importance should be placed on\r\nregional and interregional cooperation in economic planning\r\nand development. In the broader view, this will include the\r\nneed to give special attention to closing the existing gap\r\nbetween developed and developing countries. The United\r\nNations can promote coordinated activity to achieve\r\npolitical stability and democracy, to encourage investment\r\nin human resources and to identify capital resources for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Vilchez Asher (Nicaragua), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nImproved economic and social conditions are the keys\r\nto peace and stability. Indeed, this understanding is one of\r\nthe principles underlying the current peace process in the\r\nMiddle East. Only through economic growth and social\r\ndevelopment will lasting peace prevail.\r\nWe were pleased to see that the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport took note of the important developments which are\r\ncreating a new reality in the Middle East. We hope to see\r\nthis recognition of the dramatic changes in the region also\r\nreflected in the upcoming work of the General Assembly.\r\nThe United Nations and its agencies and bodies can\r\nmake a substantial contribution in the economic and social\r\nspheres. Israel believes that there is an important role for\r\nUnited Nations agencies, such as the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the\r\nNear East (UNRWA) and the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF) in providing economic and social support\r\nin Gaza and the West Bank. We urge the United Nations to\r\nallocate more funds towards this end. We hope that the\r\nappointment of the United Nations Special Coordinator will\r\nhelp facilitate the attainment of this goal.\r\nI wish also to refer to the work of the Organization\r\nregarding the question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council. The\r\nGovernment of Israel is following up on the deliberations\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group and is considering the\r\ndifferent alternatives with a view to finding the right\r\nbalance between efficiency in dealing with the new and\r\nexpanding tasks of the Security Council and\r\nrepresentation which would better reflect world realities\r\nand the present membership of the Organization.\r\nIsrael believes that any attempt by the United\r\nNations to address the question of equitable representation\r\non the Security Council must take into account the\r\nunacceptable situation in which States are reduced to the\r\nstatus of \"permanent non-members\", never eligible to\r\nserve on the Security Council, or on most other United\r\nNations bodies, for that matter. Because all Member\r\nStates share the fate of the world, all of them must also\r\nbe guaranteed the equal right to participate in the electoral\r\nprocess and the decision-making of the United Nations.\r\nIsrael has been refused membership in a geographic\r\ngroup at the United Nations and is thus barred from\r\nmembership in the Security Council, as well as in all\r\nother United Nations bodies in which elections are based\r\non regional quotas of representation. Israel is thus\r\nprevented from exercising its full rights and from\r\nassuming its full duties and responsibilities as a State\r\nMember of the United Nations. This represents a grave\r\nbreach of the principle of universality and of the principle\r\nof the equality of rights of all United Nations Member\r\nStates. It also constitutes a blot on the moral authority\r\nand prestige of the United Nations.\r\nIn our view, the time has come to put an end to this\r\nsituation. In this way, the just principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter will be respected, and all States will be able to\r\nfully assume their rights and duties as Members of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMrs. Fréchette (Canada) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I should like to associate my delegation with\r\nthose others that have thanked the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report and have congratulated him on its\r\ncomprehensive and thoughtful coverage of the work of\r\nthe Organization. The United Nations continues to face\r\nunprecedented global challenges, and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is to be complimented for the initiatives he has\r\ntaken to help the Organization address those challenges\r\nmore effectively.\r\nMy delegation is particularly pleased that the\r\nSecretary-General is attempting to implement a\r\ncomprehensive, coordinated strategy for the United\r\nNations. Lip service has long been paid to the view that\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nthe various organs of the United Nations complement and\r\nassist one another, but that view has rarely been actively\r\npursued. Not only does the Secretary-General entitle the\r\nfirst substantive chapter of his report \"Coordinating a\r\ncomprehensive strategy\", but a close reading of the entire\r\nreport makes it clear that mutual support — not only within\r\nthe Secretariat but throughout the system — is his\r\nobjective. My delegation applauds this approach and will\r\nassist in putting it into effect whenever and wherever\r\npossible.\r\nI have characterized the report as comprehensive, and\r\nit is. But this desire to cover all the facets of United\r\nNations activities may have militated against a more\r\nrigorous setting of priorities for the Organization. An\r\nemphasis on coordination must have as its inevitable\r\ncorollary a requirement for rationalization, the elimination\r\nof duplication and a commitment to ongoing reform.\r\nProgress made in the revitalization of the Organization is\r\nindeed reflected in various parts of the report, but the call\r\nto action that the Secretary-General quite rightly issues in\r\nhis conclusion might usefully have been accompanied by a\r\nmore detailed listing of priorities.\r\nWe welcome the increased attention to development\r\nissues that is reflected in the report, and we strongly\r\nendorse the Secretary-General’s contention that conflict\r\noften has economic and social origins. That is why we look\r\nforward with anticipation to his further report on his\r\nproposed Agenda for Development and to the renewed\r\nvision that it promises.\r\nWe note that the series of world conferences held this\r\nyear or scheduled for next year — the Global Conference\r\non the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women and the Second\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Human Settlements — will\r\nprovide many of the ingredients for that vision. Canada has\r\nplayed, and will continue to play, an active role both in\r\nthese conferences and in the further discussions on\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation has paid close\r\nattention to the Secretary-General’s description of the\r\nactivities of the various organs of the United Nations\r\ninvolved across the spectrum of development activity. We\r\nhave noted in particular the emphasis on the provision of\r\nemergency relief and the effect of increased demands in\r\nthis area on the operations and resources of United Nations\r\nagencies. The Secretary-General quite rightly calls for more\r\ndynamic approaches to ensure that there is a seamless and\r\nmutually supporting transition from emergency relief to\r\nsustainable development.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAnother priority area for my delegation is human\r\nrights, and we are pleased with the attention that this\r\nissue receives in the report. Canada fully shares the\r\nSecretary-General’s belief that the institutional capacity of\r\nthe United Nations to take preventive action to reduce\r\nhuman rights violations must be strengthened. In this\r\nconnection, we encourage the Centre for Human Rights\r\nand the Department of Peace-Keeping Operations to\r\ncontinue their discussions. These are the kinds of\r\ninstitution-wide, mutually supportive actions which the\r\nSecretary-General is attempting to foster and to which I\r\nreferred approvingly a few moments ago.\r\nMy delegation has also taken note of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reference to the need to bridge the gap between\r\navailable resources and the mandated work of the Centre\r\nfor Human Rights.\r\nIn its treatment of the management and budgetary\r\nchallenges facing the United Nations, the report goes\r\nsome way towards addressing the need for priorities,\r\nrationalization and streamlining to which I referred\r\nearlier. We applaud the planned reorganization of the\r\nDepartment of Administration and Management and the\r\nanticipated recommendation to eliminate the Trusteeship\r\nCouncil.\r\nAlthough it is not reflected in the report, we also\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s forthright statement of\r\n12 October to the General Assembly, in which he\r\naddressed the issue of reforming the scale of assessments.\r\nThe continuing parlous state of the finances of the United\r\nNations is clearly an issue that we must tackle seriously,\r\nand we believe that an open-ended working group of the\r\nAssembly should be set up to address it without delay.\r\nAt the same time, my delegation would have liked\r\nto see more attention paid in the report to how questions\r\nof duplication, wasted resources and inefficiency will be\r\nhandled. Member States carry an important responsibility\r\nin this connection, and it would have been useful if the\r\nSecretary-General had indicated how we could assist in\r\nthis effort. In his statement to the General Assembly\r\nduring the general debate, Canada’s Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs stated emphatically that the elimination of\r\nduplication of effort had to be a priority for the\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nOrganization. My delegation will continue to stress this\r\nrequirement.\r\nThere is much in the chapter entitled “Expanding\r\npreventive diplomacy and conflict resolution” to welcome.\r\nWe are pleased to see that a good start has been made in\r\nthe restructuring of the Department of Peace-keeping\r\nOperations, including the establishment of a stand-by\r\narrangements management unit, expansion of the resources\r\nmade available to the training unit, and the establishment of\r\nthe Situation Centre.\r\nThe stand-by arrangements project is proving to be\r\nparticularly useful for both the United Nations and Member\r\nStates in providing a base from which to assess troop\r\nrequirements. There is, however, much work that remains\r\nto be done, and we look forward to the continuation of this\r\nvaluable conceptual and practical exercise. In this\r\nconnection, I should like also to draw attention to a study\r\nthat Canada will conduct. Announced by our Foreign\r\nMinister in the General Assembly’s general debate, this will\r\nbe a study of options for strengthening the rapid-response\r\ncapability of the United Nations.\r\nFinally, my delegation is pleased that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has paid attention to the important role of\r\npreventive diplomacy. He rightly points to the need for\r\ntimely information on developing crises and to the\r\nrequirement for various parts of the Secretariat to work\r\ntogether in this effort. While we welcome the first steps\r\nthat have been taken in this direction — for instance, the\r\nsystematic-needs analysis carried out by the Department of\r\nPolitical Affairs — we believe that more can and should be\r\ndone in the area of information gathering and analysis.\r\nIn sum, the Secretary-General has given us a useful\r\ndescription of the activities of the Organization and the\r\nchallenges that it faces — in particular, the need to adapt\r\nour approaches to development so as to manage better the\r\nsituation we face. My delegation is committed to working\r\nwith the Secretary-General and other Member States in the\r\ncontinuing process of the renewal of the United Nations\r\nthat he has launched.\r\nMr. Razali (Malaysia): I should like to join those\r\nrepresentatives who have already expressed appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for the document entitled \"Report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization\"\r\n(A/49/1). In compliance with Article 98 of the Charter, the\r\nreport provides an overview, as well as covering the\r\nspectrum of activities undertaken by the United Nations\r\nduring 1993.\r\nThis year’s report includes five chapters:\r\n“Introduction”, “Coordinating a comprehensive strategy”,\r\n“The foundations of peace: development, humanitarian\r\naction and human rights”, “Expanding preventive\r\ndiplomacy and conflict resolution” and “Conclusion: a\r\ncontinuing commitment”. Except in the case of chapter\r\nIII, which in last year’s report was entitled “Developing\r\nthe global community”, the chapter titles have remained\r\nvirtually the same. The continuity in the thematic thrust\r\nis also evident.\r\nIn chapter I, “Introduction”, the Secretary-General\r\nstates:\r\n“... I submit the present annual report as a document\r\nfor reflection at this critical time in the history of the\r\nworld Organization. The structure of the report has\r\nbeen designed to enable the entities comprising the\r\nOrganization and the Governments and peoples it\r\nserves to assess intellectually, morally and\r\ninstitutionally the role of the United Nations in the\r\nworld-wide collaborative effort towards enduring\r\nhuman progress.” (A/49/1, para. 13)\r\nMy delegation takes the Secretary-General at his\r\nword and wishes to share its views on the important\r\nissues raised in this report.\r\nOverall, the report is rich with \"the immensity of\r\ndetail\" (para. 788) of the activities of the Organization. At\r\nthe same time, the report is not necessarily a complete\r\ncritique of the successes and failures of this Organization.\r\nSuch a critique would have contributed towards a\r\nqualitative assessment of the effectiveness of this unique\r\nintergovernmental body.\r\nChapter I, entitled \"Introduction\" — particularly in\r\nparagraphs 1 to 7 — succinctly captures the fundamental\r\nchallenges facing the international community: the\r\npromotion of peace, justice, human rights and\r\ndevelopment — all original aims reflected in the Charter.\r\nAs for chapter II, entitled “Coordinating a\r\ncomprehensive strategy”, the work of the principal organs,\r\nincluding the General Assembly, the Security Council, the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and the Secretariat, has been\r\nhighlighted.\r\nThis chapter recalls efforts made by the Secretariat\r\nto improve its delivery of administrative and support\r\nservices to the Organization. While these noteworthy\r\nefforts should be welcomed and supported, we wonder\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nhow the Secretariat can function effectively in the context\r\nof a seemingly endless restructuring exercise. For instance,\r\nwith the changes introduced in the coordination of the\r\nSecretariat structure concerned with issues of development,\r\nthis structure remains in a constant state of flux. These\r\nproblems need to be addressed in a transparent manner.\r\nIt is timely also at this juncture to acknowledge that\r\nthe Secretariat possesses, along with a few \"passengers\", a\r\nnumber of dedicated and highly qualified personnel, with\r\ncreative and pragmatic ideas. Yet these productive resources\r\ndo not seem to have been fully exploited — stress being\r\nlaid on management weaknesses. In this regard, the views\r\nand input of the Member States could be sought in\r\naddressing these weaknesses.\r\nIn the same chapter, reference has been made to\r\nensuring an \"adequate financial base\". My delegation fully\r\nsupports the observation in the report that\r\n\"... the continued failure of some Member States to\r\nfulfil their legal obligation to pay assessed\r\ncontributions in full and on time places the\r\nOrganization in a difficult financial situation.\" (A/49/1,\r\npara. 101)\r\nMalaysia has consistently paid its assessed\r\ncontributions on time, be it for the regular budget or for the\r\npeace-keeping budget. As of September 1994, Malaysia was\r\none of 13 countries that had paid in full the assessed\r\ncontributions for both regular and peace-keeping budgets.\r\nPayment on time and in full is critical in enabling the\r\nUnited Nations to function effectively and efficiently.\r\nWhile we recognize the economic difficulties faced by\r\nsome Member States in trying to reduce their arrears, we\r\ncannot condone the failure of those who do not pay because\r\nthey use payment as a conditionality in making demands on\r\nthe United Nations. In accordance with the Principle\r\nenunciated in Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Charter, all\r\nMembers are required to pay their assessment in full and on\r\ntime.\r\nChapter III, focusing on \"The foundations of peace:\r\ndevelopment, humanitarian action and human rights\",\r\ncovers the gamut of socio-economic issues, which form the\r\nstaple of the work of the Second and Third Committees.\r\nThe absence of consensus on the interlinkages between the\r\nissues addressed in this chapter must be recognized.\r\nAs for humanitarian action, the United Nations has\r\nplayed a sterling role, notwithstanding constraints of\r\nresources. In this regard, the important role of the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations must be acknowledged as\r\nwell. Finally, we do agree with the observation made in\r\nthe report concerning the need\r\n\"to ensure that the transition from emergency relief\r\nto sustainable development occurs in a seamless and\r\nmutually supporting fashion.\" (A/49/1, para. 316)\r\nIn chapter IV, entitled “Expanding preventive\r\ndiplomacy and conflict resolution” the focus is on the\r\nconceptual underpinning and the details of the various\r\ntypes of peace-keeping operations. Indeed, this is the\r\nlongest chapter in the report, indicating the importance\r\nattached to these issues. The much-publicized United\r\nNations involvement in peace-keeping remains at a\r\ncritical crossroads. Faced with a resource crunch and the\r\nmixed results of a number of these operations, there is an\r\nongoing debate over the future of the United Nations and\r\nits role in peace-keeping.\r\nDespite the fact that it is a small developing country,\r\nMalaysia remains actively involved in the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping activities; we are participating in 7 of the\r\n16 operations, with more than 2,800 men, making us the\r\nseventh largest troop-contributing country.\r\nAdmittedly, United Nations peace-keeping operations\r\nhave consumed substantial financial and other resources.\r\nWe recognize that, in certain situations, the collective\r\ninvolvement of the international community represented\r\nby the United Nations is necessary. At the same time, we\r\ncannot ignore peace-keeping operations whose mandates\r\nare questionable and which undermine the principles of\r\nsovereignty.\r\nMy Government has also been unequivocal in its\r\ndemand for consultation between troop-contributing\r\ncountries and the Security Council. The current practice,\r\nwhich merely involves ad hoc meetings chaired by a\r\nmember of the Secretariat, is inadequate. Article 44 of the\r\nCharter, in fact, states that the Member should be invited:\r\n\"...if the Member so desires, to participate in the\r\ndecisions of the Security Council concerning the\r\nemployment of contingents of that Member’s armed\r\nforces.\"\r\nIn chapter V, entitled \"Conclusion: a continuing\r\ncommitment\", the Secretary-General deduces:\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\n\"From the immensity of detail in these pages has\r\nemerged a clear direction for our future work.\"\r\n(A/49/1, para. 788)\r\nMy delegation is not convinced of this conclusion.\r\nWhile we acknowledge the increasing expectations of\r\nthe international community vis-à-vis the United Nations,\r\nthere is a clear need to build a consensus on the future role\r\nand direction of the United Nations. The demands have\r\nincreased, but without adequate resources.\r\nAt the same time, we note the seeming contradictions\r\nbetween paragraph 788 and 793 of the report. The former\r\nrefers to “the peoples of the world”, while the latter makes\r\nthe observation “that full and responsible participation in\r\nthe United Nations is not a top priority on the agendas of\r\nmost Member States”. If the intention in these paragraphs\r\nis to draw a distinction between the concept of peoples of\r\nthe world and the principles of Member States, my\r\ndelegation, while respecting the purpose of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral behind this, does not believe that this would be a\r\nproductive exercise at this stage of inter-State relations.\r\nThe primary and priority task ahead is to ensure that\r\nthe principles of the Charter shall be applied consistently,\r\nnot selectively, for if the perception should be the latter,\r\ntrust would wane and with it the moral authority which is\r\nthe greatest and the unique quality of this Organization. The\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations in preventing and\r\nsettling conflicts and preserving international peace is\r\ndependent on the credibility of its decisions and the degree\r\nof its consistency in the application of the principles of the\r\nCharter.\r\nIn the spirit of the Charter and in the interests of\r\nMember States, there has to be a harmonization in the\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil on the question of peace and security. We must not\r\nhave a position where the views of the general membership\r\nof the United Nations are ignored and where the Council\r\nchooses to apply principles only when it suits the interests\r\nand convenience of certain prominent Members.\r\nIt is equally important that certain principal organs of\r\nthe United Nations should not be perceived to be\r\npre-eminent at the expense of other Charter bodies. There\r\nhave also been cases in which certain Secretariat structures\r\nhave been subsumed, which we in the South regret. After\r\nall, the success of any organization lies in its ability to\r\nwork in concert with the sum total of its parts.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s comprehensive and\r\nsubstantive report on the work of the Organization, which\r\ntestifies to a large extent to the effect of the dramatic\r\nglobal changes on the priorities and activities of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAlthough we note that a good portion of the report\r\nis devoted to United Nations activities in the field of\r\npreventive diplomacy and conflict resolution, we are\r\nencouraged by the Secretary-General’s assurance that he\r\nhas\r\n“sought to correct the common misperception of the\r\nUnited Nations as an organization dedicated\r\nprimarily to peace-keeping.” (A/49/l, para. l)\r\nThis clearly supports the notion that the United\r\nNations has a pivotal role in promoting not only peace\r\nand security but also development. The Secretary-General\r\nfurther states that\r\n“while we have seen some progress towards peace\r\nand conflict management, we have seen little\r\nconcerted action towards development” (A/49/l,\r\npara. 4)\r\nand that\r\n“it is the task of the world community to...bring to\r\nfulfilment the idea of development as the long-term\r\nsolution to the root causes of conflict.” (A/49/l,\r\npara. 4)\r\nWe therefore hope the forty-ninth session will be\r\nguided by these thoughts of the Secretary-General.\r\nDevelopment is a global issue of critical dimensions and\r\nsignificant implications. The United Nations should strive\r\nto prevent attempts to marginalize developing countries or\r\nto deviate their priorities from the pursuit of economic\r\ngrowth and development and the enhancement of the\r\nwelfare and prosperity of their people.\r\nThe Secretary-General reports on the increased\r\nresponsibilities for most organs of the United Nations. We\r\nbelieve these responsibilities should be consistent with the\r\nUnited Nations role as a universal organization built upon\r\nan intergovernmental framework and democratic\r\nprinciples. It is also necessary to ensure an appropriate\r\nbalance of United Nations activities, particularly by its\r\nprincipal organs, in the fields of development, peace and\r\nsecurity — a balance which reflects both the interests and\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nconcerns of the general membership, and is consistent with\r\nthe functions and responsibilities of the principal organs of\r\nthe United Nations as mandated by the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nParagraph 20 of the report refers to the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption of a set of guidelines on the\r\nrationalization of its agenda, as set forth in resolution\r\n48/264, which is no doubt a significant step towards a more\r\neffective consideration of issues. However, rationalization\r\nis only one and not necessarily the most important aspect\r\nof resolution 48/264. In this connection, the resolution,\r\namong others, not only reaffirms the functions and powers\r\ngiven to the General Assembly by the Charter but also\r\nprovides the mandate for the Assembly to create new\r\nmachinery when necessary to consider any question within\r\nthe scope of the provisions of the Charter.\r\nWe therefore hope that the forty-ninth session will\r\nlead to the operationalization of the key provisions of\r\nresolution 48/264, and thus bring us closer to a revitalized\r\nGeneral Assembly characterized by its increased interaction\r\nwith the other principal organs of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly the Security Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\nThe Secretary-General also accurately states that the\r\nvastly enhanced activities of the Security Council have\r\ngenerated “justifiable interest in its work” (A/49/l,\r\npara. 30) and, I might add, interest in most aspects of its\r\nwork. This has been clearly reflected in the active\r\nparticipation of Member States in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the question of the increase in the membership of\r\nthe Council. The views of my delegation on this issue have\r\nbeen expressed on previous occasions and I will not dwell\r\non them now, other than to stress that it is necessary that\r\nfuture negotiations on all issues be conducted with complete\r\ntransparency in whatever negotiating mechanism or format\r\nis agreed upon by the Open-ended Working Group. Since\r\nissues involved are very important, each Member State\r\nshould have the opportunity to participate fully in the\r\ndecision-making process.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in improving the Secretariat’s delivery of\r\nadministrative and support services to the Organization. We\r\nare encouraged by his efforts to streamline the structure as\r\nwell as by his assurances that the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation of developed and developing countries at all\r\nlevels, especially at senior levels, is continually borne in\r\nmind in the selection of staff.\r\nNevertheless, given the importance of these efforts,\r\nparticularly in terms of their impact on existing\r\nprogrammes and resources, and on the interests of\r\nMember States, we believe that the forty-ninth session of\r\nthe General Assembly should examine all relevant aspects\r\nof the current restructuring of the Secretariat.\r\nEnsuring an adequate financial base for the United\r\nNations and the United Nations financial difficulties are\r\nimportant issues which must be addressed. In this regard,\r\nI believe that the issues raised by the Secretary-General\r\nin his report deserve detailed and expert examination by\r\nMember States. My delegation hopes to participate\r\nactively in their examination.\r\nOn the issue of development, to which I alluded\r\nearlier, my delegation shares the Secretary-General’s\r\nconcern for the need to strengthen links between\r\nemergency assistance, rehabilitation and long-term\r\ndevelopment, given the interrelationship of these activities\r\nin certain cases. However, we would be concerned if such\r\nlinks were to be used as a basis for eventually reorienting\r\nthe development process as we understand it, particularly\r\nwith regard to the nature and aims of multilateral\r\ncooperation for development as well as the role and\r\npriorities of the United Nations in promoting such\r\ncooperation. These have been amply spelled out in the\r\nvarious development commitments already adopted, which\r\nprovide the overall framework for international\r\ncooperation for development.\r\nIt would be more important for this session to focus\r\non time-bound action-oriented measures, possibly in the\r\ncontext of an agenda for development, to ensure the\r\neffective implementation of development commitments.\r\nThis would invigorate the prospects for sustained growth\r\nand development, thereby leading to greater international\r\npeace and security. An agenda should also strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations in international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe note the Secretary-General’s observations in Part\r\nIV, that his report on “An Agenda for Peace” has led to\r\na number of activities and reforms within the United\r\nNations system. However, we had also been looking\r\nforward to his summary of developments on the\r\nimplementation of certain aspects of General Assembly\r\nresolution 47/120 B on “An Agenda for Peace”, the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s response to that report. We would\r\nhave appreciated an exposition of his thoughts and views\r\non this resolution, especially those related to peace-\r\nkeeping operations.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nThe Philippines recognizes the collective nature and\r\nthe important contribution of United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. However, they should not be a substitute for the\r\npacific settlement of disputes through political means. In\r\nthis regard we have advocated for some time the need for\r\nagreed guiding principles for United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations, particularly for interventions in intra-State\r\nconflicts. This would preclude the danger of selective\r\nintervention based on national rather than collective\r\ninterests, as well as the lack of consistency in actions taken.\r\nAn agreed set of principles for peace-keeping operations\r\nwould help to ensure consistency in their application and\r\nuse, and eliminate the perception of a possible double\r\nstandard in the making of Security Council decisions on\r\npeace-keeping operations. In other words, these principles\r\nwould provide an agreed conceptual and political\r\nframework for the establishment and conduct of United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations, firmly grounded on the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nFinally, paragraphs 424 and 426 of the report refer to\r\nthe need for sustained political resolve and public support\r\nfor United Nations peace-keeping operations. We agree\r\nwith the Secretary-General on this need. However, what\r\nmust be ensured is how to secure and sustain this resolve.\r\nWe can think of no better way of doing so than by\r\ninstitutionalizing consultations between the Security\r\nCouncil, the troop-contributing countries, the general\r\nmembership and the Secretariat. Naturally, these\r\nconsultations should not prejudice the Security Council’s\r\ndecision-making authority on international peace and\r\nsecurity matters.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation is very pleased to see you, Sir, the\r\nrepresentative of the fraternal country of Nicaragua,\r\npresiding over this segment of our work.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nMy delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his report on the work of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nThe annual consideration by the General Assembly of\r\nthis important document, submitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral pursuant to Article 98 of the Charter, provides a\r\nunique opportunity for Member States to have a\r\ncomprehensive overview of the activities undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as to engage in an informed\r\ndiscussion on the overall direction and pace of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMy delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General\r\nfor presenting once again this year quite an extensive and\r\ndetailed report. It reflects the variety and complexity of\r\nthe tasks undertaken by the various departments of the\r\nSecretariat and by other component parts of the United\r\nNations system in carrying out the purposes of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe are particularly pleased to note that the\r\nSecretary-General has endeavoured to present a balanced\r\nvision of the overall role of the Organization, seeking to\r\ncorrect\r\n\"... the common misperception of the United Nations\r\nas an organization dedicated primarily to peace-\r\nkeeping\". (A/49/1, para. 1)\r\nMy delegation has always held that conflicts have,\r\nmore frequently than not, economic and social root\r\ncauses, and therefore that the main foundations of\r\ninternational peace and security lie in the active\r\npromotion of disarmament, development and\r\ndemocratization of relations within and among nations.\r\nIt was precisely due to these considerations that, in\r\nstudying the important document \"An Agenda for Peace\"\r\n(A/47/277) — which highlighted the importance of\r\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking and\r\npost-conflict peace-building — my delegation deemed it\r\nequally relevant to underscore the importance of\r\npreventive peace-building. Thus, at the forty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly, Brazil pointed out that\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" could not overlook the equally\r\nimportant “An Agenda for Development” (A/48/935) and\r\nthat it was incumbent upon us to endow the United\r\nNations with the necessary instruments and the\r\nprospective vision to make this universal forum the core\r\nof collective efforts for the improvement of relations\r\namong peoples and nations.\r\nConsistent with these considerations, Brazil\r\nparticipated actively in the deliberations that led to the\r\nadoption of resolution 47/181, requesting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to prepare a comprehensive document outlining\r\nan agenda for development. We were also deeply engaged\r\nin the World Hearings on Development, promoted by the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\r\nsession last June, and as an input to the deliberations on\r\nthe matter we presented a paper entitled \"A Brazilian\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\napproach to an agenda for development: a contribution to\r\nthe current debate at the United Nations.\r\nAt the current session of the General Assembly, Brazil\r\nonce again has underscored the need for striking a balance\r\nbetween “An Agenda for Peace” and “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment”, and stressed the importance of attributing to\r\ninternational efforts in the field of development the same\r\npriority given to current activities of peace-keeping. In this\r\nregard, the Brazilian Government is proposing the\r\nconvening of a United Nations conference on development\r\nto be held, possibly in 1996, with the purpose of\r\nestablishing a new development paradigm and setting up a\r\nconceptual framework for major international initiatives in\r\nthe field of development.\r\nIt is my Government’s considered view that the series\r\nof global conferences that started with the Rio Conference\r\nof 1992, and encompassing other crucial conferences in\r\nBarbados, Yokohama, Cairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and\r\nIstanbul, will be shaping a new and comprehensive vision\r\nof development as it emerges from the discussions on “An\r\nAgenda for Development”, whose articulation and concerted\r\nimplementation should ultimately be consolidated at the\r\nproposed United Nations conference on development.\r\nWe believe that due to its universal composition,\r\ndemocratic decision-making procedures and public\r\nvisibility, the United Nations is the most appropriate body\r\nto help forge the necessary global consensus in this field.\r\nIn this regard, important progress could be made at the\r\ncurrent session and a crucial momentum could be gained in\r\n1995, since the fiftieth anniversary year represents, as\r\npointed out by the Secretary-General in his report,\r\n\"an invaluable opportunity to forge a global consensus\r\nbehind development, in all of its dimensions, as the\r\nmost lasting foundation for international peace and\r\nsecurity and as the greatest hope for all humanity.\"\r\n(para. 12)\r\nNeedless to say, my delegation stands ready to work\r\nactively with other delegations on this important question.\r\nTurning to peace-keeping operations, my delegation is\r\nappreciative of the very useful information contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on the many operations currently\r\nunder way. We once again pay tribute to all the selflessly\r\ndedicated and courageous personnel participating in these\r\noperations, many of them under extremely difficult and\r\ndangerous conditions.\r\nThe increasing complexity of these operations, as\r\nobserved by the Secretary General, has imposed many\r\nnew burdens and difficulties in their organization and\r\nimplementation. Indeed, there is a noticeable fatigue on\r\nthe part of Member States to commit new troops and\r\nequipment under uncertain conditions and situations. The\r\nSecretariat also finds itself overworked and understaffed.\r\nThe Security Council, in turn, is becoming more reticent\r\nat launching new missions and has outlined in its\r\npresidential statement, contained in document\r\nS/PRST/1994/22, a set of guidelines to be considered in\r\nsuch future operations. And the cost of financing existing\r\noperations has been multiplied by five in five years,\r\nreaching a magnitude four times larger than the resources\r\ncommitted to operational activities for development.\r\nHence, perhaps, the source of the so-called misperception\r\nthat the Organization was dedicated primarily to peace-\r\nkeeping to the detriment of other urgent activities such as\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs stated on other occasions, my delegation believes\r\nthat the time has come for a comprehensive rethinking of\r\nthe principles and practices observed by the United\r\nNations in the field of peace-keeping.\r\nIn view of the complexity and dangers involved in\r\nsome of the new types of operations, troop-contributing\r\ncountries increasingly request to be kept thoroughly\r\nabreast of the developments in the field and to be\r\nconsulted by the Security Council during its decision-\r\nmaking process. This is understandable and justifiable,\r\nsince the great majority of Member States contributing to\r\nthese operations are not represented in the Council. While\r\nwe welcome the more frequent consultations with troop-\r\ncontributing countries by the Secretariat, with a view to\r\nkeeping the former fully apprised of developments having\r\nimplications for their personnel, additional measures are\r\nneeded to increase the transparency and accountability in\r\nthe decision-making process concerning peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nMoreover, the mandates for many of the new\r\noperations seem quite wide-ranging, involving not only\r\npeace-keeping activities but also humanitarian assistance,\r\nelectoral monitoring, mine-clearing, rebuilding of\r\ninstitutions, and so forth. In view of the obvious\r\ncomplexity of the task of coordinating and integrating all\r\nthese functions, such mandates should be carefully\r\nconsidered by all parties concerned, including those that\r\nwill be in charge of carrying them out in the field. This\r\nis a crucial area where in-depth consultations between the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nSecurity Council, the Secretariat and the troop-contributing\r\ncountries are clearly required.\r\nMy delegation shares the Secretary-General’s concern\r\nregarding the seriousness of the Organization’s financial\r\nsituation. Brazil is fully committed to the efforts to provide\r\na sound, equitable, transparent and stable financial base for\r\nthe Organization and stands ready to cooperate in the\r\ndeliberations of the Fifth Committee with a view to finding\r\na solution that is satisfactory to all concerned.\r\nWe note that in his conclusion the Secretary-General\r\nemphasizes that the continuing commitment of all States to\r\nthe United Nations must rest on a conviction that the\r\nOrganization is capable of comprehensively addressing\r\nglobal issues of peace, sustainable development and social\r\njustice. Furthermore, he observes that such a commitment\r\ncan be achieved through the process of democratization\r\nwithin States, among States and throughout the international\r\nsystem.\r\nThe delegation of Brazil considers these observations\r\nparticularly fitting to the current state of the Organization,\r\nas they seem to recall the intimate correlation between\r\ndemocracy and taxation through representation. It is the\r\nstrong belief of my delegation that the commitment of\r\nMember States to the United Nations must derive from a\r\ngeneralized perception of the legitimacy of the whole\r\nOrganization. Legitimacy, in turn, is predicated upon\r\nequitable representation in all relevant decision-making\r\nbodies.\r\nWe underscore, in this regard, that in its resolution\r\n1854 (XVII), adopted in 1962, the General Assembly\r\nendorsed the Advisory Opinion of the International Court\r\nof Justice recognizing the principle of the collective\r\nresponsibility of all Member States in the financing of\r\npeace-keeping operations, and that in its resolution 1874\r\n(S-IV), adopted at its fourth special session, in 1963, the\r\nAssembly enshrined the principle of the special\r\nresponsibility of the permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil in such financing. The Assembly, in its resolution\r\n3101 (XXVIII), adopted in 1973, took these principles fully\r\ninto account in establishing the current special scale of\r\nassessments for peace-keeping operations.\r\nThe great bulk of the expenses of the Organization\r\nderives from the unprecedented number of peace-keeping\r\noperations authorized by the Security Council. The\r\npermanent members have a special responsibility for these\r\ndecisions. Brazil firmly believes that the best way to\r\nprovide a sound and long-lasting solution to the financial\r\nsituation of the Organization is to observe the principle of\r\nequitable taxation with equitable representation. We stand\r\nready to cooperate in this endeavour.\r\nMr. Abdellah (Tunisia) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): We are meeting today to evaluate the activities\r\nof the Organization during the past year and to work\r\ncollectively to enable it to deal effectively with challenges\r\nin the field of security and peace-keeping and in the\r\npromotion of global integrated development.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s has made a useful\r\ncontribution to revitalizing the Organization to enable it\r\nto promote the triptych of peace, development and\r\ndemocracy. He has provided the impetus for fruitful\r\nreflection on the Organization’s future and the vision of\r\nthe international order that must be built: an order that\r\nwill be more just and will be directed towards partnership\r\nand constructive dialogue but will not disregard the\r\nmutual interests of States.\r\nIn this context I would like to state again how much\r\nwe appreciate the untiring efforts the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is making to set up the\r\nstructures and instruments that can revive preventive\r\ndiplomacy, good offices and mediation as key instruments\r\nfor containing or helping to resolve situations of potential\r\nor actual conflict.\r\nIn his report entitled “An Agenda for Development”,\r\nMr. Boutros-Ghali states that\r\n“Development is a fundamental human right.\r\nDevelopment is the most secure basis for peace”.\r\n(A/48/935, para. 3)\r\nWe fully endorse that statement. We also have in mind\r\nthe urgent requirement that the development needs of\r\npeoples and communities be met.\r\nIndeed, most conflicts have their origins in the\r\ndisastrous social and economic situation in some\r\ncommunities. Displacements of population and flows of\r\nrefugees often result in violence followed by a breakdown\r\nof State structures and the destruction of infrastructures.\r\nWe are aware of the humanitarian imperative\r\nreferred to in the Secretary-General’s report, and we\r\nendorse his identification of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment as two of the critical factors\r\ncontributing to the breakdown of societies and the\r\noutbreak of violence.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nWe are also convinced that preventive action should\r\ntake pride of place in addressing difficulties and obstacles\r\nthat could lead to violence. As the Secretary-General has\r\nemphasized, determined and sustained action towards\r\ndevelopment is the best course that the international\r\ncommunity can take to ensure that the crisis in development\r\nwill not continue.\r\nFrom that point of view, the quest for effective\r\nstructural solutions to the problem of indebtedness is a key\r\napproach to be explored as we seek to ensure the\r\nharmonious development to which our nations aspire.\r\nIndebtedness, which some developing countries have\r\nbegun to solve, remains a major source of concern for\r\nAfrican countries. In this connection, it should be noted that\r\ndeteriorating terms of trade and a fall in commodity prices\r\nare among the main impediments to the continent’s\r\ndevelopment efforts. The goal of sustainable development\r\ntherefore remains one of the main challenges before the\r\ninternational community, since we must maintain the\r\nenvironmental balance while protecting the right of present\r\nand future generations to economic development and social\r\nprogress, without jeopardizing the foundations of a healthy\r\nenvironment.\r\nTo that end, and aware of the need for international\r\nand regional cooperation in this area, in conformity with\r\nEarth Summit decisions, Tunisia and its Mediterranean\r\npartners will hold in November in Tunisia a regional\r\nconference on sustainable development. That meeting,\r\nwhich has been dubbed “Med 21”, will bring together\r\nenvironment Ministers of Mediterranean countries and\r\nrepresentatives of the European Union, the World Bank, the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme, the United\r\nNations Development Programme and other international\r\nand non-governmental organizations. This conference,\r\nconvened by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, is a\r\nturning point in the history of the region, giving concrete\r\nexpression to the determination of the countries on both\r\nshores of the Mediterranean to ease their transition into the\r\nnext century with a regenerated and promising ecosystem.\r\nSustained recovery and development in Africa must\r\nremain one of the Organization’s priorities. As we see it,\r\nthis is not a matter of preferential or discriminatory\r\ntreatment that would benefit one region at the expense of\r\nanother. It is not only a long-term investment in the well-\r\nbeing of mankind, but also a duty of the international\r\ncommunity in order to bring this region into the mainstream\r\nof the world economy and trade and thus effectively attack\r\nthe real, deep-rooted causes of local and regional conflicts.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, his staff, the Economic Commission for Africa\r\nto implement the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. The reports on\r\nfinancial flows to Africa and the creation of a commodity\r\ndiversification fund, in the context of the New Agenda,\r\ndeserve our support and call for an in-depth follow-up,\r\nexamination, followed by concrete, practical measures.\r\nIn his message to the General Assembly, President\r\nZine El Abidine Ben Ali, the current Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), stated:\r\n“Clearly, the efforts that Africa is currently\r\nmaking to solve the problems of the present and to\r\nsecure the future deserve the support and assistance\r\nof the international community.” (Official Records of\r\nthe General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 15th meeting, p. 5)\r\nThis appeal for solidarity and for more generous support\r\nis justified by, among other things, the determination of\r\nAfrica, and the work it has already done towards reform\r\nand adaptation and to integrate itself further into the\r\nworld economy and relaunch the development of its\r\nproductive capacities and human resources.\r\nIn this connection, I am pleased to state that,\r\nbeginning today, African Ministers of Trade are holding\r\nin Tunis a conference to consider the impact of the\r\noutcome of the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the\r\neconomies of their respective countries. The Tunis\r\nconference is a concrete expression of African countries’\r\nfull commitment to the Uruguay Round agreements and\r\nto be active participants in the new shape of international\r\ntrade in goods and services. The endeavours of the\r\nAfrican continent in this regard clearly call for the\r\ninternational community’s support and for substantial\r\nmobilization of additional resources to back up the bold,\r\ndecisive actions taken by African countries, despite the\r\nunpredictability and uncertainty of the world economic\r\nand financial situation.\r\nThat is why we must express our concern, in the\r\nlight of the Secretary-General’s report, at the disturbing\r\ntrend towards reducing the resources allocated for\r\noperational activities and development in general. We are\r\nparticularly concerned by the fact that the operational arm\r\nof the Organization, the Economic Commission for\r\nAfrica, no longer has sufficient funds to carry through its\r\ndevelopment activities in Africa. Additional\r\nextrabudgetary resources would be helpful and highly\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nappreciated. They are a necessary support for the\r\nimplementation of these projects, which are of vital\r\nimportance to African countries.\r\nPreventive action, both diplomatic and humanitarian,\r\nis commendable and has our firm support. Whether we are\r\naddressing natural disasters, conflict situations or other\r\ndifficulties, the Organization must manage its human and\r\nmaterial resources effectively. We must express our\r\ngratitude for the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General to\r\nconsolidate the appropriate structures within the Secretariat\r\nand to ensure that the Organization’s activities, particularly\r\nin peace-keeping operations, are more effective.\r\nA qualitative improvement in planning and\r\nmanagement of operations has been observed. It is clear\r\nthat this effort must be pursued. But we wish to express our\r\nfull understanding of the Secretary-General’s concern,\r\nreiterated in his statement to the Assembly on 12 October,\r\nthat the financial stability of the Organization remains a\r\nmatter of concern and a major imperative for all of us. It is,\r\nin fact, a guarantee of the implementation of collective\r\nsecurity, as provided for in the Charter.\r\nThe strengthening of the Organization’s peace-keeping\r\ncapacities should in no way undermine its activities in the\r\nfield of enhancing socio-economic development, particularly\r\nof the poorer peoples and countries. We believe that even\r\npeace-keeping operations should be accompanied by firm\r\neconomic measures. It is not enough to provide specific\r\nassistance; there must be a commitment to assist in\r\nreconstructing areas affected by the destruction and violence\r\nof conflicts. This must involve the construction of health\r\nfacilities and schools, assistance in mine-clearance,\r\nagricultural rehabilitation and the building of infrastructure\r\nfor the supply of drinking water and other such basic\r\nactivities. The Organization has a clear responsibility to\r\nassist communities that have been thus affected. These\r\nmeasures to restore and subsequently consolidate peace\r\nafter hostilities have ceased are the minimum level of\r\ncommitment to be sought of the United Nations.\r\nThe work of regional organizations, either as a driving\r\nforce or in support services, cannot replace that of the\r\nUnited Nations. For its part, the OAU, which has\r\nestablished institutional mechanisms for the prevention and\r\nmanagement of conflicts, as well as a political framework\r\nfor undertaking certain peace-keeping operations, either\r\njointly or directly through its own efforts, intends to\r\ncontinue its cooperation with the United Nations so as to\r\nenhance its operational and logistic capabilities and\r\ncontribute to peacemaking and peace-keeping.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the\r\noutset, I should like to join previous speakers in thanking\r\nthe Secretary-General for his informative and\r\ncomprehensive report, which presents the many activities\r\nand achievements of the Organization that constitute the\r\nsubstance of our deliberations today.\r\nThe Permanent Representative of Indonesia, speaking\r\non behalf of the non-aligned countries, has already\r\ncommented on various issues mentioned in the report. My\r\ndelegation fully endorses those remarks, and therefore\r\nwill limit itself to certain areas of discussion.\r\nOn the eve of its fiftieth anniversary the United\r\nNations faces unique opportunities and challenges. Recent\r\nsubstantial developments at the international level have\r\ngiven rise to re-evaluations aimed at enhancing its\r\neffectiveness. Our Organization, as the sole world\r\nstructure, has both the responsibility and the potential to\r\nrespond to the demands for change by moving in the right\r\ndirection. In this connection, my delegation notes with\r\nsatisfaction the Secretary-General’s view that\r\n\"The United Nations must renew and strengthen its\r\ncommitment to work in the economic and social\r\nfields as an end in itself and as the means of\r\nattending to the sources of conflicts\" (A/49/1,\r\npara. 4).\r\nRoutine serious consideration of the concerns and\r\ninterests of the world’s majority, those living in\r\ndeveloping countries, is the ideal for shaping a favourable\r\ninternational environment. The United Nations should\r\nspare no effort to develop an effective mechanism to deal\r\nwith this vital need. One essential element would be\r\nconsideration of the views expressed by the majority of\r\nMember States, which could effectively ensure the\r\ncomprehensiveness of that process. In this context, my\r\ndelegation believes that the positions adopted by the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 must be\r\nappropriately considered by the United Nations.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has stated, contributions to\r\nUnited Nations development activities have dramatically\r\ndecreased, making it difficult for the United Nations\r\nsystem to fulfil its commitments on development issues as\r\nenvisaged in the Charter. However, while the Rio\r\nConference stressed that contributions to development\r\nprogrammes should be increased, we have unfortunately\r\nwitnessed a serious downturn in the resources available\r\nfor development.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nIn recent years the questions of the revitalization of\r\nthe United Nations system, especially of its development\r\nactivities, and of coordination between its different organs\r\nhave been prominently raised by all Member States. In this\r\nregard, we have witnessed some progress in the\r\nimplementation of resolution 47/199 and other related\r\nresolutions, but much more should be done to enhance the\r\nefficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness of United\r\nNations operational activities, in conformity with the\r\nrequirements of developing countries.\r\nWhile my delegation supports the strengthening of the\r\nresident coordination system, we strongly believe that the\r\nnational plans and priorities of each country constitute the\r\nonly viable frame of reference for United Nations\r\noperational activities and that the authority of the resident\r\ncoordinator should not go beyond that defined by General\r\nAssembly resolutions.\r\nWe attach great importance to the revised report of the\r\nSecretary-General on an Agenda for Development, which\r\nis to be issued in the next few days. We hope that this\r\nreport will contain action-oriented recommendations and\r\nconcrete proposals on various issues, including international\r\ntrade, financial resources, debt relief, transfer of technology\r\nand a coordination system for development activities at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nAs indicated in the report, the complexity of the\r\ninternational situation and the deterioration of peace and\r\nsecurity in many parts of the world have made it necessary\r\nfor the Security Council to play an active role, evidenced\r\nin part by its frequent formal and informal meetings. In our\r\nview, the more active the Council is, the more accountable\r\nit should be to the general membership of the Organization.\r\nNeedless to say, overlooking that accountability would\r\nseriously undermine the credibility of the Council. The\r\nSecretary-General, in paragraph 30 of his report, states that\r\nthere is some concern at the Council’s tendency to deal\r\nwith issues \"that are regarded as falling outside its\r\npurview\". Moreover, to be more credible and democratic,\r\nthe Council should be transparent, cease applying double\r\nstandards and improve its decision-making process and\r\nworking methods.\r\nThe Secretary-General has indicated that increased\r\nparticipation in the consideration in the General Assembly\r\nof the item relating to the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil is evidence of Member States’ interest in the work\r\nof the Council. My delegation, while concurring with this\r\nargument, emphasizes the importance of implementing\r\nresolution 48/264, on revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and in particular operative\r\nparagraph 4, which:\r\n\"Invites the President of the General Assembly,\r\nfollowing consultations, to propose appropriate ways\r\nand means to facilitate an in-depth discussion by the\r\nAssembly of matters contained in the reports\r\nsubmitted to it by the Security Council\".\r\nMy country has always supported the need to protect\r\nand promote human rights, which should be guided by the\r\nprinciples of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity.\r\nHowever, we, along with other non-aligned countries,\r\nstrongly reject the use of human rights as a means of\r\npolitical exploitation and express concern at the tendency\r\nto address some aspects of human rights selectively while\r\nneglecting economic, social and cultural rights, which\r\nrelate to human needs. We are of the view that\r\ndemocracy, development and respect for all human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms are interdependent.\r\nIn this context, the delegation of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran has taken note of the activities\r\nundertaken by the High Commissioner for Human Rights,\r\nas reflected in the Secretary-General’s report. We\r\nparticipated actively last year in the Working Group of\r\nthe Third Committee, in which the mandate of the High\r\nCommissioner was shaped. We firmly believe that the\r\nWorking Group of the Third Committee at this session\r\nshould expedite its deliberations so that the objectives set\r\nout in the Vienna Declaration, as well as those principles\r\ncontained in the Declaration on the Right to Development,\r\ncan be promoted and reinforced. In this regard, every\r\neffort should be made to evaluate the existing\r\nmechanisms and procedures of the United Nations human\r\nrights bodies, so as to avoid duplication in the interest of\r\nstreamlining the work of those bodies.\r\nAs regards paragraph 744 of the report, on the 1995\r\nreview and extension Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, we\r\nare convinced that during the Conference special attention\r\nshould be given to reviewing the Treaty, in order to\r\nevaluate its achievements and find ways of remedying its\r\nshortcomings, before any discussions are held on its\r\nlimited renewal.\r\nTurning to paragraph 746 of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport, on the chemical weapons Convention, we believe\r\nthat no tangible progress has been achieved in the course\r\nof discussions in the Preparatory Commission for the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. It\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nis a matter of concern that certain countries are not\r\nprepared to honour their commitments under the chemical\r\nweapons Convention, in particular on the implementation of\r\narticle 11 of the Convention, relating to economic and\r\ntechnical cooperation in the chemical sector.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General points to several\r\naspects of peace-keeping operations and highlights the\r\nimportance of those operations and their contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. My\r\ndelegation is of the view that all aspects of peace-keeping\r\noperations should strictly adhere to the purposes and\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nin particular the principle of full respect for the sovereignty,\r\nsovereign equality and territorial integrity of all States and\r\nnon-intervention in their internal affairs. Peace-keeping\r\noperations should be distinct from other types of United\r\nNations field operations, which are governed by their own\r\nrespective mandates; equitable opportunities should be\r\nensured to facilitate the widest possible participation of\r\nMember States in peace-keeping operations. In this respect,\r\nthe United Nations should avail itself of every offer that\r\nMember States are prepared to make.\r\nCommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations deserves to be marked by a revitalized and\r\nobjective tendency towards proper adjustments, as required\r\nby the new era. Many ideas have already been put forward\r\nas to how to make the Organization more capable and\r\nefficient. Next year, such views will be increasingly brought\r\nup by almost all actors on the international scene.\r\nTremendous efforts and expertise should be deployed to\r\nfacilitate the momentous task of dealing with all these ideas\r\nand views in a comprehensive manner. The Secretariat\r\namong other groups will have to shoulder an onerous\r\nresponsibility in tackling this issue, particularly in preparing\r\nthe required reports. As we cover all the steps of this re-\r\nexamination process, significant elements that must not be\r\nneglected are: a sober analysis of the Organizations’ past\r\nperformance, especially in the development field, and the\r\nsearch for common ground to achieve global consensus. It\r\nis an undeniable fact that the primacy of political\r\nconsiderations over humanitarian values has sabotaged\r\nfelicitous utilization of much of the potential of the\r\nOrganization; the persistence of this situation constitutes the\r\nshortcoming that is most hazardous for the future work of\r\nthe United Nations. As emphasized earlier by the Foreign\r\nMinister of the Islamic Republic of Iran in his statement\r\nbefore the Assembly,\r\n“Preparations and planning for the second half-\r\ncentury of the existence of the United Nations should\r\nbe conducted in full cognizance of this shortcoming,\r\nand with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of\r\nthe Organization in carrying out those agreed tasks\r\nthat are of interest and importance to the\r\ninternational community in its entirety”. (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Forty-ninth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 5th meeting, p. 42)\r\nMr. Cassar (Malta): This is the third report\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, in accordance with Article 98 of the Charter. My\r\ndelegation would like to join others in congratulating the\r\nSecretary-General on having reported on the work of the\r\nOrganization in such a comprehensive manner.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s recommends that the United\r\nNations should attend to the immediate problems of\r\nconflict, under all circumstances keeping in mind the\r\naspects of development. Today, the intrinsic link between\r\na lasting peace and efforts to promote economic, social\r\nand political development is universally acknowledged.\r\nThis awareness, however, brings with it new\r\nresponsibilities and obligations. As the Secretary-General\r\npoints out,\r\n“We can build enduring foundations for a\r\nsecure, just and creative era for all humanity”.\r\n(A/49/1, para. 791)\r\n“The extraordinary challenges and possibilities\r\nof this moment in time require the most dedicated\r\nand far-reaching response”. (ibid., para. 795)\r\nMy Government shares the conviction that in all its\r\nefforts the United Nations should derive its purpose not\r\nfrom minimum political denominators but from the\r\nprinciples of common humanity, the values enshrined in\r\nthe Charter.\r\nMr. Ntakibirora (Burundi), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe United Nations and the system of institutions\r\nthat have evolved around it are essentially rooted in the\r\nexperiences and idealism that prevailed in the immediate\r\naftermath of the Second World War. The cold-war era\r\nvastly disturbed the functioning of these institutions and,\r\nin some key areas, eroded their credibility. In today’s\r\nrapidly changing world, these institutions are urgently\r\nseeking to redefine and revitalize their roles in order to\r\nenhance their relevance and effectiveness. The present\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\ndiscussion is an important element in that ongoing process.\r\nThe report rightfully stresses the importance of a\r\nsound financial base for the United Nations to respond to\r\nthe varied demands imposed by a new world order. The\r\ncommitment of Member States to ensuring adequate\r\nfinancial resources is of extreme importance. All United\r\nNations Members should honour their obligations. Malta\r\nwelcomes the administrative reforms that have been\r\nintroduced within the Organization, aimed at eliminating\r\nunnecessary bureaucratic layers, and appreciates the full\r\ncooperation of the Secretariat staff in responding quickly\r\nand flexibly to new mandates of the Organization.\r\nThe Secretary-General proposes to improve the\r\nbudgetary review and the approval process for peace-\r\nkeeping operations. The granting of longer periods of\r\nfinancial authorization is extremely important. Member\r\nStates should be in the position described by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, able\r\n“to anticipate, with a greater degree of accuracy, the\r\nfinancial burdens they will be expected to bear when\r\npeace-keeping mandates are extended by the Security\r\nCouncil”. (ibid., para. 105)\r\nThe scope of United Nations peace-keeping has moved\r\naway from the traditional patrolling of buffer zones and\r\nsupervision of cease-fires. More imaginative and, at times,\r\neven dangerous operations, such as the disarming of\r\nwarring factions and the protection of the delivery of\r\nhumanitarian relief, are being boldly undertaken. In just\r\nover five years, the number of military personnel involved\r\nin United Nations peace-keeping has risen from around\r\n10,000 to more than 70,000.\r\nThe report identifies some of the difficulties\r\nencountered in this increasingly challenging venture and the\r\nefforts to address them. Of particular interest is the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiative to establish stand-by\r\narrangements for peace-keeping. At a pre-operation stage\r\nindividual Members would enter into commitments with the\r\nUnited Nations to contribute specific resources for peace-\r\nkeeping operations, within agreed response times. The\r\nsovereign right to decide on participation in the specific\r\noperation for which assistance is being sought would be\r\nretained. My Government is examining these arrangements\r\nwith the attention they deserve.\r\nDuring his term as President of the General Assembly\r\nat its forty-fifth session Mr. Guido de Marco launched a\r\nproposal that the Conference on Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (CSCE) declare itself a regional arrangement\r\nunder Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, a\r\nproposal later formalized by Malta at the CSCE Council\r\nof Ministers meeting at Prague and at the Helsinki follow-\r\nup meeting. That proposal was adopted by the CSCE\r\nHeads of State and Government at the Helsinki II\r\nSummit.\r\nMy Government welcomes the initiatives taken by\r\nthe Secretary-General in the past year to further the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations. This cooperation is particularly important\r\nbecause the scourge of war still brings untold sorrow to\r\nmankind in a number of regional conflicts.\r\nMy delegation believes that cooperation with\r\nregional organizations is also important with regard to\r\nnew threats to internal and regional security, such as\r\nthose posed by international drug trafficking and\r\norganized crime. The work of the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme, headed by Mr.\r\nGiorgio Giacomelli, deserves our praise and merits our\r\ncomplete and comprehensive support.\r\nA vision of international solidarity is essential as we\r\nstrive to ensure the enjoyment of human dignity for all\r\npersons forming part of our global community. The\r\nconsolidation of democracy is of primary importance in\r\nthis respect, and my Government fully supports United\r\nNations efforts in helping States that request assistance in\r\nthis field.\r\nThe monitoring of elections is a key contribution to\r\nstability; elections must not only be fair, but also be seen\r\nto be fair. The erosion of democracy through the\r\nmanipulation of elections is an affront to the will of the\r\npeople. Nothing justifies the thwarting of the people’s\r\nright to choose those who will govern them.\r\nThe interrelatedness of development and security is\r\nmanifest in the dangers lurking in a world sharply divided\r\nbetween an affluent minority and a poor majority. If the\r\naxis of global confrontation which existed between East\r\nand West is not to shift to one between North and South,\r\nwe must ensure that the iron curtain is not replaced by a\r\npoverty curtain.\r\nThe capacity of the United Nations system to\r\naddress the wide range of mutually related issues is\r\nweakened by an uneven evolution of its major institutions.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nThe Economic and Social Council was entrusted by\r\nthe Charter with responsibility for economic and social\r\ndevelopment. However, it has been unable to develop a\r\nviable relationship, not only with the Bretton Woods\r\nInstitutions, but also with a number of specialized agencies\r\nwith sectoral mandates in the field of development. More\r\ncritically, the Council has failed to develop that relationship\r\nwith the General Assembly which would have ensured the\r\nproper insertion of the development dimension into the\r\nquest for global peace and security. The immediacy with\r\nwhich development issues are merging into issues of\r\nsecurity should lend urgency to the long-standing effort to\r\nrestructure and revitalize the economic and social sectors of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe General Assembly is the only organ of the\r\ninternational institutional system in which all States are full\r\nand permanent members, with the widest possible mandate\r\nto consider all issues bearing on inter-State relations. The\r\nprocess of revitalization of the General Assembly is only in\r\npart that of making its deliberations more streamlined and\r\nefficient. Efficiency must have a purpose beyond itself. In\r\nthe case of the General Assembly, the purpose is the\r\npolitical objective of placing the Assembly firmly at the\r\ncentre of international cooperation towards peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe primary task of the Organization remains the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In his\r\nreport the Secretary-General states:\r\n“In the altered context of today’s world, the definition\r\nof security is no longer limited to questions of land\r\nand weapons. It now includes economic well-being,\r\nenvironmental sustainability and the protection of\r\nhuman rights.” (A/49/1, para. 4)\r\nThese elements are key components of that broader\r\ncommon heritage of mankind which we acknowledge as a\r\nforce of inspiration in our action.\r\nThe concept of a common heritage is today enshrined\r\nin a number of conventions. This is to our collective credit,\r\nfor it proves a sense of responsibility and equity in viewing\r\nour obligations towards present and future generations. It is\r\nproof of the intergenerational solidarity for which we all\r\nstrive in the creation of a truly dignified humanity.\r\nThis universal acceptance has brought about a growth\r\nin the number of United Nations bodies which endeavour\r\nto protect and promote the distinct aspects of the common\r\nheritage. These units work independently in an almost\r\ncompletely uncoordinated fashion. In our efforts in\r\ndistinct fields we must not lose sight of the broader\r\npicture. Separate spheres of activity must work in unison\r\nif the worthy objective of a sustainable legacy for future\r\ngenerations is to be achieved. Institutional fragmentation\r\nposes a real threat to an effective functioning of a more\r\nequitable international order. Each cog affects the\r\nfunctioning of the whole. Institutional oversight is\r\nessential.\r\nRather than reinventing the wheel, my Government\r\nis proposing an evolution in the role of the Trusteeship\r\nCouncil. In first proposing this reform four years ago, my\r\nDeputy Prime Minister, Mr. Guido de Marco, as President\r\nof the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly,\r\nsuggested alternative approaches to the functions and\r\nmandate of the Trusteeship Council. Now, following the\r\nNovember 1993 plebiscite in which the people of Palau\r\nfreely exercised their right to self-determination. the\r\nTrusteeship Agreement of the last remaining Territory\r\nunder the trusteeship system came to an end. In view of\r\nthis, on 25 May 1994 the Trusteeship Council adopted an\r\namendment to its rules of procedure establishing that the\r\nCouncil will now meet as and where the occasion might\r\nrequire by its decision or its President’s decision, or at the\r\nrequest of a majority of its members, the General\r\nAssembly or the Security Council.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General recommends that\r\nthe General Assembly proceed with steps to eliminate the\r\norgan in accordance with Article 108 of the Charter. My\r\nGovernment has taken note of this. Before proceeding\r\nwith this line of action, however, we feel that alternatives\r\nshould be considered. The Trusteeship Council has fallen\r\nvictim to its own success. It fulfilled the mandate\r\nprescribed for it almost 50 years ago. We believe that its\r\nmandate can evolve to meet the needs of a changed\r\ninternational system.\r\nThe new role of the Council would be that of\r\nholding in trust for humanity its common heritage. It\r\nwould provide a working forum in which different\r\nauthorities responsible for the common heritage and\r\nconcerns can coordinate their efforts. Such coordination\r\nis today required over a broad spectrum of interrelated\r\nissues ranging from climate change to human rights. By\r\nconsolidating the manner in which the common heritage\r\ncan continue to be part of international policy-making, we\r\nwould be reaffirming and committing ourselves to the\r\nSecretary-General’s appeal, that of employing the United\r\nNations more efficiently, effectively and responsibly\r\nacross the widest range of global concerns.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nA transformed Trusteeship Council would give true\r\nexpression to the Secretary-General’s concluding statement\r\nin his report, namely, that\r\n“the United Nations is even more than an instrument\r\nof peace, justice and cooperative development among\r\nnations; it is the repository of hope for humanity and\r\nthe future. That hope deserves our deepest continuing\r\ncommitment.” (A/49/1, para. 797)\r\nThe challenges facing the United Nations after its\r\nfiftieth year are daunting. A second-generation United\r\nNations must shoulder the responsibility of ensuring peace\r\nin freedom. For too long humanity has been held hostage\r\nto the ideological divisions which denied it of a deserved\r\nparticipation and sharing in the common wealth. The\r\nsuffering of so many millions still denied their rightful\r\nenjoyment of human dignity leaves us with no alternative\r\nbut to work to make the principled resolve of our\r\nforefathers in the Charter become a tangible reality.\r\nMrs. Albright (United States of America): The United\r\nStates is pleased to have this opportunity to respond to the\r\nSecretary-General’s clear and comprehensive report\r\n(A/49/1). The report contains a wealth of information\r\nreflecting the range and value of United Nations work. My\r\nGovernment appreciates the energy that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has brought to his responsibilities.\r\nAs we enter the fiftieth year of the United Nations, the\r\ntides of history have granted us an unprecedented\r\nopportunity to work cooperatively towards the lofty goals\r\nfor which the United Nations was formed. Today the\r\ndividends of international cooperation are evident around\r\nthe globe: reduced nuclear tensions, an agreement on world\r\ntrade, heroic progress towards peace in the Middle East, an\r\ninspiring transition to democracy in South Africa, the\r\nrestoration of legitimate authority in Haiti, growing\r\nawareness of the need for sustainable development, and\r\nsteady improvements in child immunization and health. In\r\nevery region of the world we see examples of men and\r\nwomen pushing back the limits of past possibility and rising\r\nabove historical resentments, insecurities and limitations.\r\nFrom Central Europe to Central America, from South-East\r\nAsia to Africa, we see the release of new and positive\r\nenergies nurtured by freedom and dedicated to the future.\r\nBut as the Secretary-General’s report illustrates, there\r\nare perilous cross-currents at work. In Bosnia and Rwanda,\r\nwe have witnessed atrocities of a magnitude matched only\r\nrarely in this century. In too many regions the exploitation\r\nof ethnic and cultural divisions is fostering instability,\r\nstrangling growth, slowing reforms and forcing innocent\r\nfamilies from their homes.\r\nThe explosion of humanitarian emergencies has\r\nnecessarily seized the immediate attention of the\r\ninternational community, distracting from strategies for\r\nmore lasting human and social development. Our\r\nchallenge is to cope with immediate needs while\r\nassembling the building blocks required for long-term\r\nprogress. In this endeavour there is no sure recipe for\r\nsuccess. No model is without flaws. A broad and\r\ncontinuing international discussion aimed at establishing\r\na working consensus and partnership on these issues is\r\nrequired. The United States will continue to contribute its\r\nown ideas, and we will continue to listen with care to the\r\nideas of others.\r\nAs a way of contributing to that discussion, let me\r\ntoday cite briefly some of the specific steps that the\r\nUnited States believes can be taken by the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session to advance the\r\ninterlocking goals of peace, prosperity and democracy in\r\nthe new world.\r\nFirst, we must persist in efforts to make United\r\nNations peace-keeping a more effective instrument of\r\ncollective security. My Government is encouraged by the\r\nprogress that is being made to discipline decision-making,\r\nmodernize capabilities, professionalize management and\r\nimprove coordination with humanitarian operations. The\r\nexperience in Rwanda highlights the need for a United\r\nNations logistics base and for arrangements that will\r\nallow a more rapid deployment of forces in support of\r\nSecurity Council decisions.\r\nThe Secretary-General is correct to stress the\r\nimportance of Member State backing for, and\r\nparticipation in, United Nations peace-keeping. Under\r\nPresident Clinton’s leadership, the United States is\r\nstriving to do its part. This fall we paid $1.2 billion to\r\nmeet our assessments through the end of the calendar\r\nyear. We are providing technical help, information and\r\npersonnel to the Department of Peace-keeping Operations\r\non a regular basis. We have responded positively to the\r\nSecretary General’s stand-by forces initiative, listing the\r\nkinds of capabilities that might be available, under\r\nappropriate circumstances, to assist United Nations\r\noperations. America’s unique capacities have also been\r\nemployed outside United Nations peace-keeping, but in\r\nsupport of United Nations-endorsed objectives in Somalia,\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Rwanda and Haiti.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nA second area where the Assembly can make a major\r\ncontribution is arms control and disarmament. We will be\r\nseeking a strong endorsement for extending indefinitely the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The\r\nlongevity of the Treaty is of central importance to the\r\nsuccess of other arms-control and non-proliferation\r\npriorities, including a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.\r\nWe also look forward to the Assembly’s continued support\r\nfor measures to restrain trade in deadly anti-personnel land-\r\nmines. Too many civilians — especially too many\r\nchildren — have been killed or maimed by these\r\nindiscriminate, inexpensive tools of terror.\r\nThirdly, the Secretary-General mentions, in reference\r\nto his upcoming report on the Agenda for Development, a\r\nhost of economic and environmental issues with which the\r\nUnited Nations system and its Member States must\r\neffectively deal. The times have made possible — and the\r\ndepth of the problems urgently requires — pragmatic,\r\nnon-divisive approaches which reflect the complexities of\r\nsustainable development that go beyond economic rates of\r\ngrowth. Goals should be forward-looking, but achievable.\r\nThe United States believes that Agenda 21 and the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, supplemented by\r\nthe outcomes of recent or upcoming global conferences on\r\nhuman rights, population, social development and women,\r\nshould form the core of the United Nations development\r\nagenda. We also see some need for strengthening\r\ncooperation between United Nations agencies and the\r\nWorld Bank and other Bretton Woods institutions, without\r\nencroaching on the fundamental responsibilities of either.\r\nAnd we continue to believe deeply that open economic and\r\npolitical systems are essential prerequisites to broadened\r\nopportunity and sustained growth.\r\nIn his report the Secretary-General correctly cites\r\nanother priority, which is to strengthen the links between\r\nemergency assistance, rehabilitation and long-term\r\ndevelopment. The United States will continue to work\r\nclosely with the Secretariat and other States to make\r\nprogress towards this goal.\r\nFourthly, the United States urges United Nations\r\nMembers to continue broadening and deepening the\r\nactivities of this Organization in support of democracy,\r\nhuman rights and justice. These, too, are interlocking goals\r\nand our support for them, both political and financial, is a\r\nvital component of preventive diplomacy and development.\r\nIn that connection, we are impressed with the bold and\r\ninnovative efforts of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the continuing\r\ndiligence and dedication of the Centre for Human Rights.\r\nWe believe the United Nations should take pride in its\r\nsuccessful efforts to support transitions to civil peace and\r\ndemocracy in places as diverse as Namibia, Cambodia, El\r\nSalvador, South Africa and, we hope, now Mozambique.\r\nFinally, we attach profound significance to the work of\r\nthe war—crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and\r\nto the parallel panel we expect to see created for Rwanda.\r\nThese efforts, taken together, are testimony to the\r\ngrowth of this institution, not merely as an instrument of\r\nGovernments, but as a voice for individuals, each of\r\nwhom, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, deserves to\r\nbe free, deserves to have his or her basic dignity\r\nrespected and deserves security from the perpetrators of\r\ncrimes against humanity.\r\nThe fifth issue I will mention today concerns the\r\nMiddle East. Yesterday, in Jordan, the world witnessed\r\nfurther evidence that past limits of possibility have been\r\nexceeded. Even the deepest resentments and insecurities\r\ncan be overcome by those determined to shape history,\r\nnot be imprisoned by it. We will have an opportunity in\r\nthe Assembly this fall to build on the breakthroughs that\r\nhave occurred between Israel and Jordan and between\r\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The time\r\nhas come to dispense entirely with the polemics and\r\ndivisiveness of the past. In that volatile region peace\r\nremains fragile. Our message to terrorists on all sides who\r\nwould destroy peace must be resolute. This Organization\r\nmust stand unambiguously on the side of the region’s\r\npeacemakers. We must do all we can to encourage them\r\nand to help their citizens achieve what President Clinton\r\nhas called the quiet miracle of a normal life.\r\nSixthly, the United States remains committed to\r\nworking with all Members to make the United Nations a\r\nbetter, more efficient mechanism for meeting the shared\r\nneeds of our citizens. We welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s plan for reorganizing the ably led Department\r\nof Administration and Management in order to achieve\r\n“a lean, streamlined department with clear lines of\r\nresponsibility and accountability.” (A/49/1, para. 62)\r\nWe were pleased, as well, with the Assembly’s\r\ndecision to establish a new Office of Internal Oversight\r\nServices. This fall, and in the months ahead, we shall\r\nseek to ensure that adequate resources are available for\r\nthat Office and that its operational independence is\r\nmaintained.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nWe should bear in mind that in this era of plentiful\r\nemergencies and limited resources efficiency has a human\r\nface. Funds saved through better management, less\r\nduplication and less waste are funds available to care for\r\nchildren, to return refugees to their homes and to help\r\ncommunities to build or rebuild for the future. Member\r\nStates have a responsibility to work with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his staff to guarantee that the funds contributed\r\nto the United Nations are used wisely and efficiently.\r\nMember States also have an obligation to see that the\r\nfinancial viability of the Organization is maintained. As the\r\nSecretary-General points out in this report, this is a\r\npolitical, not just a financial, issue. We believe that a high-\r\nlevel, open-ended working group of the General Assembly\r\nshould review the elements of and possible solutions to the\r\nfunding problem.\r\nFinally, we encourage continued work on the issue of\r\nSecurity Council reform. The United States is among the\r\nmany countries that have stressed the importance of\r\nachieving broader participation on the Council without\r\ncompromising effectiveness. Germany and Japan should be\r\nadded as permanent members in recognition of their\r\ncapacity to contribute to international peace, prosperity and\r\nsecurity. The addition of three non-permanent seats would\r\nbroaden participation further, without unduly expanding the\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe must also build on current efforts to involve\r\nMember States in and inform them about Council activities\r\nthrough increased transparency and stronger working\r\nrelationships between the Council and countries contributing\r\nto United Nations peace-keeping operations. The credibility\r\nand effectiveness of the United Nations Security Council is\r\na matter of concern to all who wish to see resolute and\r\ncooperative action on behalf of international peace and law.\r\nWe must not allow the procedural complexity of making\r\nreforms to impede their accomplishment.\r\nWe shall soon begin the second half century of the\r\nUnited Nations. Today, more than ever before, we have the\r\nchance to help the Organization to fulfil its promise. We\r\nneed not confine ourselves to the cramped horizons of past\r\naccomplishment. The new United Nations has the potential\r\nto move far beyond the old in preserving peace, limiting the\r\ntransfer of deadly arms, promoting democracy, defending\r\nhuman rights, encouraging sustainable economic growth,\r\npreventing disease and increasing respect for law.\r\nFormer Secretary-General Hammarskjöld once said\r\nthat we should\r\n\"stop thinking of the United Nations as a weird\r\nPicasso abstraction and see it as a drawing [we]\r\nmade ourselves.\"\r\nAs Member States, we must all take responsibility\r\nfor adapting the structures of the United Nations to the\r\nneeds of a new era. In so doing, we will serve our\r\ntaxpayers well, we will serve the United Nations well,\r\nand we will help to create a global order in which both\r\nour interests and the values enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter are reflected and preserved.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
