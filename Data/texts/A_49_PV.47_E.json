(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Biegman\r\n(Netherlands), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/49/1)\r\nMr. Bhatia (India): Our congratulations go to the\r\nPresident, Mr. Essy, who assumed the presidency at a\r\nsignificant juncture in the evolution of the functioning of\r\nthe United Nations. The discussions on the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/49/1)\r\nprovide a particularly opportune occasion for us to share\r\nour vision of the United Nations as we approach its fiftieth\r\nanniversary and as we move ever closer to the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to place on record my\r\nGovernment’s deep appreciation for the leadership and\r\ndrive that Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has provided to the\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations. His deep understanding\r\nof the problems that face the international community at\r\nthis critical juncture in its history are a great asset. We\r\napplaud his efforts in attempting to provide a new vision\r\nfor the United Nations, keeping in view the individual\r\ncomplexities that abound in Member States and the need\r\nfor consensus decision-making.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General has been\r\npainstakingly produced. In his very opening remarks, the\r\nSecretary-General has sought to correct the impression\r\nthat the United Nations as an Organization is dedicated\r\nprimarily to peace-keeping. He stresses that the United\r\nNations is deepening its attention to the foundations of\r\npeace, which lie in the realm of development. We in India\r\nhave been concerned at the imbalance that created the\r\nimpression referred to by the Secretary-General, and we\r\nfirmly believe that the new agenda of the United Nations\r\nmust give peace and development equal priority and\r\ntreatment. It will be recalled that in his statement at the\r\n14th meeting, on 3 October 1994, the leader of the Indian\r\ndelegation to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession stressed that with its universal participation and\r\ncomprehensive mandate, the General Assembly should\r\napproach such a holistic vision and revitalize that vision\r\ninto action.\r\nAs we debate the report of the Secretary-General in\r\nthe perspective of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations and the approach of the twenty-first century, we\r\nshould perhaps first dwell upon the challenges that we are\r\nlikely to carry from the past into the twenty-first century.\r\nAn understanding of these challenges is critical to the\r\nnew role that we envisage for the United Nations. The\r\nUnited Nations is constituted of sovereign nation-States\r\nand the challenge they face on the path of nation-building,\r\nbased on pluralism, is first and foremost the massive\r\nchallenge of development. Failure to meet this challenge\r\nwould mean greater inequality and poverty, which would\r\nonly breed further tension. The other major challenges are\r\ncare for the environment, the threat to the unity and peace\r\nof nation-States and fundamentalist fanaticism traceable\r\nto causes unrelated to religion.\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nThe Secretary-General’s annual report makes a valiant\r\neffort to address the challenges to which I have referred.\r\nThe position of my Government on the issues involved and\r\nthe methodology for addressing these challenges was spelt\r\nout in some detail in the statement of the leader of the\r\nIndian delegation in the general debate on 3 October 1994.\r\nThe efforts made by my Government to adapt to the\r\nhistoric changes that have taken place in the world during\r\nthe past few years have focused on adapting available\r\npositive ideas, processes and technologies to India’s specific\r\nrequirements. In doing so, we do not intend to forget our\r\nown traditions and our own special circumstances. The\r\nchallenges are common, but uniform solutions, to be\r\nsuccessfully implemented, keeping in view considerations\r\nof equity, must necessarily take cognizance of national\r\nsituations.\r\nSolutions must also be flexible. As the Prime Minister\r\nof India once described it:\r\n“In India we recognize the change but maintain a\r\nbalance, which has come to be known as the middle\r\nway.”\r\nWe believe that at this United Nations we must find\r\na \"collective middle way\" that reflects the genius of our\r\nindividual traditions and is consistent with the need for\r\nrapid economic development, modernity and sustained\r\npeace.\r\nThe United Nations is today involved in attempting to\r\nkeep the peace in different parts of the world. In the\r\nabsence of a common vision in the post-cold-war era, its\r\nexperiences in this domain have been mixed. In spite of the\r\nend of the cold war, the perception persists that, somehow,\r\nbalance-of-power considerations continue to impact on\r\ndecision-making at the United Nations. The notions of\r\nbalance of power and the retention of exclusive rights for\r\nthe militarily and economically dominant States are still\r\npreponderant. It is still being argued by some leading\r\nanalysts that a new world order will have to emerge, much\r\nas it did in the past century, from a reconciliation and\r\nbalancing of competing national interests. It is regrettable\r\nthat such perceptions not only exist but continue to\r\ninfluence the activities of the international community. For\r\nthe international community to succeed in the imperative of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, it must be\r\nensured that the purposes and principles set forth in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter are adhered to, not only by Member\r\nStates, but by the Organization itself and its specialized agencies.\r\nI have chosen to address the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in philosophical terms, for I believe that our\r\ndebate on his report provides us with yet another\r\nopportunity to learn from our past mistakes and to focus\r\nthe United Nations on a direction that would enable us\r\ntogether to establish a new world order characterized by\r\ntrue equity, peace and prosperity for all peoples and\r\nnations.\r\nBefore I conclude, I should like to associate my\r\ndelegation with the statement made earlier today by\r\nIndonesia on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nMr. Kalpagé, (Sri Lanka): I would like to extend\r\nthe grateful thanks of the Sri Lanka delegation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization. Last year’s report was described by the\r\nSecretary-General himself as \"the longest report...to the\r\nGeneral Assembly...in many years\" (A/48/l, para.26). I\r\nwould like to describe this year’s report as a\r\ncomprehensive and well-conceived account of the\r\nmultifarious and far-reaching activities of the\r\nOrganization at a particularly complex time in its\r\nevolution.\r\nThe Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the non-aligned countries, has made\r\nan analysis of the Secretary-General’s report on the work\r\nof the Organization, with which my delegation, in general,\r\nagrees.\r\nAs the introduction to the report indicates, the\r\nSecretary-General has sought to shift the Organization’s\r\nfocus away from a primary emphasis on post-cold-war\r\npolitical priorities to a more fundamental, if less dramatic,\r\nfocus on development concerns. The emphasis on\r\ndevelopment is not one which ignores or shies away from\r\npolitical realities. In fact the Secretary-General seeks to\r\ndelve into the root causes of political instability —\r\n“deepening...attention to the foundations of peace,\r\nwhich lie in the realm of development”. (A/49/1,\r\npara.1)\r\nThe report covers the full gamut of the United\r\nNations global and regional involvement — development\r\nactivities, social and humanitarian concerns, the protection\r\nof human rights, preventive diplomacy, peacemaking,\r\npeace-keeping, peace-building, disarmament, and so on.\r\nWhat is of particular importance to my delegation is that\r\neach of these specific areas should not be considered as\r\nseparate entities to be approached in isolation. We see all\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nthese issues as interconnected and intrinsically related to the\r\nOrganization’s ultimate goal: the welfare of humanity in all\r\nits dimensions. In his report, the Secretary-General himself\r\nidentifies five development dimensions which he sees as\r\nfunctioning together in an interlocking and mutually\r\nreinforcing manner. These are peace, the economy, the\r\nenvironment, society and democracy — parts of a whole.\r\nThese are all aspects of critical importance to every\r\nState. However, the United Nations is perhaps of greater\r\nrelevance to smaller developing countries which are more\r\nvulnerable to the fallout from the immense changes that are\r\nstill taking place. These countries need to rely heavily on\r\nthe United Nations, including at the most basic level, to\r\npreserve their independence and sovereignty and to protect\r\nthem from unsolicited external intervention.\r\nSmall countries are not merely subjective recipients of\r\nthe benefits of the United Nations. In a real way, by their\r\nactive participation in the work of the Organization, they\r\ncontribute to the common purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter. In a world in which interdependence has moved\r\nfrom an abstraction to a reality, a reality which we are all\r\nbeing forced to accept, the function of the United Nations\r\nas a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations has\r\nbecome even more central. The United Nations remains a\r\nparliament to which all sovereign national units of the\r\nhuman family need to belong. In this situation, the Security\r\nCouncil plays very much the role of a cabinet as in a\r\nfunctioning parliamentary democracy.\r\nInterest in the work of the Security Council, and\r\nindeed of membership in it, stems not only from\r\napprehensions that small States may be left out of vital\r\ndecisions affecting their people. The United Nations, more\r\nthan at any other time in its history, is not only more\r\ndeeply involved in its traditional functions but has moved\r\ninto radically new areas of activity which profoundly affect\r\nall States as never before. The Secretary-General’s report\r\nmakes this abundantly clear.\r\nIt is in this context that the establishment of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, acquires special significance. The\r\nSecretary-General has noted that although the discussions\r\nin the Group were constructive they did not result in\r\nconcrete recommendations. Nevertheless the message that\r\nemanated from the Group is not one that should be ignored.\r\nWe are glad that the President of the General Assembly has\r\ncaused the Open-ended Working Group to continue its\r\nmandate in the current session as well. We hope that in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report next year he will be able to\r\nreport conclusions which will make the Security Council\r\nmore transparent in methodology, more representative in\r\ncharacter, and therefore, in sum, more efficient and\r\neffective in its functioning.\r\nConfronted with an increasing case-load of conflicts,\r\nthe use of the instrument of peace-keeping has grown in\r\nfrequency, variety, complexity and cost. Some peace-\r\nkeeping efforts have fully succeeded while others have\r\nnot. Some have generated controversy. There were also\r\nsituations in which the peace-keeping efforts failed to\r\nmaterialize in a timely manner. We agree with the\r\nSecretary-General that these setbacks should not make us\r\ndiscard this useful tool. However, our experience shows\r\nthat peace-keeping operations are not an all-embracing\r\npanacea. A consultative rather than a prescriptive\r\napproach is needed. Action has to be taken selectively and\r\non a case-by-case basis. We therefore agree with the\r\nSecretary-General that much can be learned from the\r\nsetbacks suffered by the current operations in defining a\r\npragmatic policy.\r\nThe Secretary-General himself points out that some\r\nconflicts simply cannot be managed effectively, let alone\r\nresolved solely through the instrument of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping. There have also been instances where\r\npolitical interests of individual countries rather than the\r\nobjective merits of the situation appear to dictate action\r\nor inaction. Peace-keeping costs have risen sharply. All\r\nMember States are required to share these costs, while\r\ndecisions on peace-keeping are being taken by a limited\r\nnumber of Member States. This raises the question of\r\naccountability and legitimacy. The capacity of the United\r\nNations and its agencies has been stretched to the\r\nmaximum in coping with their peace-keeping obligations.\r\nThis has sometimes resulted in the determination of\r\npriorities detrimental to the development activities of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Organization will be\r\nan appropriate occasion to rededicate the Organization to\r\nits indisputable mandate for collective action in promoting\r\ndevelopment, economic growth and prosperity for all. The\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, which will take\r\nplace in the fiftieth anniversary year, will be an\r\nopportunity to be grasped. We would therefore hope that\r\nthe preparatory international debate on the critical\r\nquestions of development and democratization will move\r\nbeyond a replay of known positions. The Summit should\r\nproduce a realistic programme of action which will\r\npromote prosperity for all. The trend of democratization\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nsweeping across the globe runs the danger of being\r\nreversed if a renewed vision of development is not put into\r\naction and the underlying causes of conflict are not\r\naddressed. Without development, no enduring foundation\r\nfor peace and security can be built. In 1995 we must strive\r\nto have a creative international consensus without sliding\r\nback to the rhetoric of a bygone era.\r\nThe financial situation of the United Nations continues\r\nto be in crisis. The cash-flow situation remains critical.\r\nThere is a note of desperation when the Secretary-General\r\nstates:\r\n“The unpredictability and irregularity of\r\ncontributions from Member States make it extremely\r\ndifficult to manage the Organization effectively”.\r\n(A/49/1, para. 103)\r\nMy delegation supports the specific measures outlined in\r\nthe report to encourage Member States to meet their\r\nCharter obligations.\r\nIn the interests of time, my delegation will refrain\r\nfrom discussing specific issues such as the Middle East,\r\napartheid and peacemaking, on which positive\r\ndevelopments have been reported by the Secretary-General.\r\nThere are several other issues also which threaten the\r\nefficient functioning of the United Nations. My delegation\r\nwill reserve comment on such matters for the relevant\r\nagenda items.\r\nIn a rapidly changing international scene, it is difficult\r\nto foresee much of the future. But as the Secretary-General\r\nstates:\r\n“The extraordinary challenges and possibilities of this\r\nmoment in time require the most dedicated and far-\r\nreaching response.” (Ibid., para. 795)\r\nIn the fiftieth anniversary year ahead, the occasion\r\nmust be seized to provide a new momentum, a new vision,\r\nfor the United Nations.\r\nMr. Tsepkala (Belarus) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Belarus expresses deep\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for preparing and\r\nsubmitting to us the report on the work of the Organization\r\nfor the past year (A/49/l). The report certainly contains an\r\nin-depth and comprehensive analysis of the activities of the\r\nbodies of the United Nations and Departments of the\r\nSecretariat over the past year and, in addition, develops a\r\nconcept of how to solve the most difficult tasks facing the\r\nUnited Nations at this stage — that is, how to attain the\r\npurposes set forth in the Charter. We note the scientific\r\nand philosophic elaboration of the idea of development as\r\na means of ensuring long-term progress for mankind; and\r\nwe fully support the idea that development is a\r\nmultidimensional notion with a number of conceptual\r\nglobal categories. It is a process dealing with such areas\r\nof human activity as peace; the economy; the\r\nenvironment; and the social sphere, with its most\r\nimportant political component — democracy. It is vitally\r\nimportant that, at a time when bloodshed and conflict are\r\nescalating in so many parts of the world, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report should point out the causes of such\r\nconflicts. Conflicts, primarily the most brutal ones, are\r\nignited in those parts of the world where hunger rages,\r\nlawlessness rules and human rights are abused.\r\nOver the past year the international community has\r\nwitnessed a dynamic transitional period, with phenomena\r\nsuch as a re-evaluation of the present potential for\r\npeacemaking, development and cooperation between\r\nStates. So it is quite natural that the United Nations\r\nshould not have stood aloof from all of this. Its principal\r\nand subsidiary bodies, which are currently being\r\nrestructured, are adapting to new circumstances and some\r\nof them, having achieved their noble goals, are yielding\r\nto other bodies confronted with equally difficult tasks.\r\nThe Trusteeship Council and the Special Committee\r\nagainst Apartheid are good examples. The Commission\r\nfor Sustainable Development is one of the new bodies.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus has already expressed its\r\nviews on reform in the United Nations. We advocate a\r\nmore effective, a more dynamic and a more democratic\r\nOrganization which would act as a centre for coordinating\r\nthe actions of States on a global, regional and national\r\nlevel. In the present rapidly changing circumstances, this\r\ncan be achieved only if the Organization can adapt to a\r\nnew situation quickly. In this connection, we support the\r\nSecretary-General’s ideas on the principal organs of the\r\nOrganization, including the Trusteeship Council.\r\nThe success of United Nations activities and\r\nimplementation of its decisions depend to a large extent\r\non what is done by the Secretariat. The Republic of\r\nBelarus welcomes the restructuring of the Secretariat\r\nbeing carried out by the Secretary-General which is\r\ndesigned to make it more streamlined and to ensure a\r\nstricter system of accountability and hierarchy. We trust\r\nthat this will lead to a more economic use of the financial\r\nresources available.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General now before us\r\nstates quite correctly that there is no doubt that peace and\r\ndevelopment are related. The convening of many\r\ninternational conferences on development bears witness to\r\nthe fact that peace is based on development, humanitarian\r\nactivities and respect for human rights. These conferences\r\nare held at a time when conflicts are escalating, and this is\r\nno accident. In trying to root out the underlying causes of\r\nconflict, the international community must constantly turn\r\nto issues of development, including the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island States, reduction of the dangers\r\nof natural disasters, and issues of with population, housing\r\nand social development. Our Republic has participated in\r\nseveral international conferences on these issues and has\r\ncontributed to the elaboration of the recommendations\r\nadopted.\r\nMost of these events and conferences have been\r\nfocused on the interests and needs of developing countries.\r\nBelarus accepts these specific circumstances and recognizes\r\nthe needs of this group of countries, primarily the least\r\ndeveloped and the ecologically most vulnerable. We have\r\nalways supported, and will continue to support, international\r\ninitiatives for those countries.\r\nWe also note that measures have been taken in the\r\ninterest of countries that have their economies in transition,\r\nalthough these have not been very significant ones. But we\r\ncannot agree that the United Nations should pay little\r\nattention to the specific circumstances of economies in\r\ntransition. Like other groups of States, these have their own\r\nneeds and their own problems in trying to carry out the\r\ntransition to sustainable development, and their legitimate\r\ninterests should be taken into account. This is necessary\r\nalso because of negative developments relating to the\r\ninterim period of transition from a centralized economy to\r\na market one: the untimely, limited application of measures\r\nfor the protection and restoration of the environment to\r\ncertain countries in this period of transition may have\r\nnegative global implications for sustainable development in\r\nvarious parts of the world. There are serious obstacles to\r\nintegration into the world and the European economy, most\r\nof which are not of an economic nature and constitute the\r\nvestiges of cold-war stereotypes. However, the economies\r\nin transition, including Belarus, are making active efforts to\r\ncreate open economic systems with a market orientation.\r\nThe delegation of Belarus thanks the Secretary-General\r\nfor focusing attention in his report on relief operations\r\nrelating to the Chernobyl disaster. The report states quite\r\nrightly that Belarus “bore the brunt of the radioactive\r\ncontamination” and that the “consequences ... still affect\r\nlarge numbers of the population”. (A/49/1, para. 343)\r\nHowever, as the Secretary-General also notes, there is a\r\nsevere shortage of funds for the work of the Inter-Agency\r\nTask Force on Chernobyl. In this connection, the\r\ndelegation of Belarus expresses its sincere thanks to the\r\nUnited Nations Coordinator of International Cooperation\r\non Chernobyl for his measures to mobilize assistance in\r\ndealing with the consequences of the disaster. In\r\nparticular, we thank him for sending letters to the heads\r\nof private enterprises throughout the world asking for\r\nparticipation in helping to alleviate the problems resulting\r\nfrom the accident. The Government of the Republic of\r\nBelarus hopes that these requests will be duly responded\r\nto and that additional resources will be received for the\r\nChernobyl relief operation.\r\nTurning now to chapter IV of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, which concerns preventive diplomacy\r\nand conflict resolution, my delegation first of all\r\nunderlines the significance of “An Agenda for Peace”\r\n(A/47/277), which offers a conceptual foundation for\r\ndiscussing issues relating to international peace and\r\nsecurity following the end of the cold war. The report, in\r\nfact, has been a starting-point for many specific reforms\r\nwithin the United Nations system. We therefore welcome\r\nthe measures taken by the Secretary-General, pursuant to\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/120 A and the request of\r\nthe President of the Security Council. We feel that the\r\neffectiveness, streamlining and transparency of peace-\r\nkeeping operations and activities will be improved\r\nthrough the holding of briefings for Security Council\r\nmembers by representatives of the Secretary-General,\r\nthrough better coordination by the Secretariat in making\r\nand implementing decisions on peace-keeping activities\r\nthrough the adoption of measures to create an early-\r\nwarning mechanism for situations that might threaten\r\ninternational peace and security, and through the\r\nelaboration of measures to strengthen the Organization’s\r\ncapacity to prepare for and carry out peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s conclusion that\r\nthe resources to implement preventive diplomacy and\r\npeace-keeping\r\n“are paltry by comparison with the huge cost in\r\nhuman suffering and material damage which war\r\nalways brings or with the less huge, but nevertheless\r\nsubstantial, cost of deploying a peace-keeping\r\noperation after hostilities have broken out.” (A/49/1,\r\npara. 411)\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nOn the basis of this conclusion, the Secretary-General has\r\nattached priority to preventive diplomacy and peacemaking.\r\nThis is fully in accord with the observations made by the\r\nBelarusian representatives on peace-keeping-operation\r\nissues. Over the long term we should try to focus\r\nexclusively on preventive diplomacy, establishing peace-\r\nkeeping operations only in exceptional circumstances.\r\nBelarus currently makes a rather modest contribution\r\nto United Nations activities on crisis management and\r\nconflict resolution: we have provided specialists for\r\nmonitoring elections. However, we recognize that there is\r\na shortage in military and other personnel for peace-keeping\r\noperations; this point was made by the Secretary-General\r\nwhen he visited Belarus in April of this year, and it is\r\nreflected in the report before us. We are taking measures to\r\nrespond to this concern in concrete and positive terms. The\r\nissue of the participation of Belarusian military contingents\r\nin peace-keeping operations is currently under consideration\r\nby our legislative and executive authorities.\r\nOur brief comments on chapter IV of the report testify\r\nto our support for United Nations activities in preventive\r\ndiplomacy and conflict resolution. Nevertheless, the greater\r\ninvolvement of the United Nations in the resolution of a\r\ngrowing number of conflicts is creating a considerable\r\noverload in the financial and human resources of the\r\nOrganization. Given the long-term financial crisis facing the\r\nUnited Nations, this overload may be a threat to the\r\nOrganization. The time may come when the United Nations\r\nwill simply not be able to meet its obligations, which will\r\nmake it much more difficult to settle any conflicts and will\r\nalso do serious damage to the Organization’s credibility.\r\nFurthermore, the increase in the number of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations invariably leads to a substantial\r\nincrease in the financial burden on the Members of the\r\nOrganization, which may become too heavy for some to\r\nbear. This relates primarily to those countries whose\r\ncontribution does not reflect their actual economic capacity.\r\nAlas, the Republic of Belarus is one such country.\r\nThus so we understand the concern of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral over the difficult financial situation of the\r\nOrganization. We understand that owing to the\r\nunpredictability and irregularity of contributions made by\r\nMember States, it is extremely difficult to manage the\r\nOrganization efficiently. However, we can hardly agree to\r\nsuch measures as the charging of interest on late payments.\r\nThis will not really help the United Nations to deal with its\r\nfinancial crisis; rather, it will simply lead to an increase in\r\nunpaid contributions of countries, particularly when\r\nfinancial debts to the United Nations are occasioned by the\r\ndifficult economic situation of the Member concerned.\r\nIndebtedness and the resulting financial crisis for the\r\nUnited Nations constitute in themselves a kind of conflict,\r\nand as in the case of any other conflict we have to look\r\nat the underlying causes if we are going to resolve it. We\r\nbelieve that one of the main problems is the applying of\r\noutdated approaches to elaborating the scale of\r\nassessments for the regular budget and for peace-keeping\r\noperations, which does not reflect the fundamental\r\nprinciple of the ability of States to pay. We believe this\r\nis one of the major causes of the financial crisis.\r\nThe establishment of a sound legislative basis for the\r\nfinancial activities of the Organization would substantially\r\ncontribute to the preparations for the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations, and we welcome the report’s\r\nchapter on the subject.\r\nFinally, I should like once again to express our\r\nsupport for the United Nations in its new phase of\r\nactivities aimed at achieving the goals of development in\r\nall its dimensions and, through this, at the elimination of\r\nthe roots of conflict, the creation of a new system of\r\ninternational cooperation and the establishment of a solid\r\nfoundation for a secure, just and creative era for the\r\nbenefit of all mankind.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): On behalf of the Algerian delegation, I should\r\nlike to extend my warm congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the substantive\r\nreport he has submitted to the General Assembly. My\r\ndelegation is pleased to be participating in a discussion on\r\nthe report, the content of which is not confined to\r\nexamining the Organization’s work over the past year but\r\ncontains proposals and ideas, sometimes innovative,\r\ncalling for deeper reflection in the evaluation of their\r\nimpact on the functioning and effectiveness of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe particularly compact nature of the report reflects\r\nthe vitality of the United Nations and the irreplaceability\r\nof its role and vocation as a centre for dialogue and\r\ncooperation among States. On the other hand, this makes\r\na deep and painstaking analysis of this document\r\nsomewhat laborious. Thus, I shall confine myself to\r\nmaking a few comments on those parts of the report\r\nwhich we feel to be crucial to our situation as a\r\ndeveloping country resolved more than ever before to\r\nmaking the United Nations the vector of multilateral\r\ncooperation for development. In this spirit, Algeria fully\r\nendorses the comments and suggestions made this\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nmorning by the Permanent Representative of Indonesia,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and its\r\nmember States.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report is a valuable tool for\r\nevaluating the determination of the international community\r\nto give concrete expression to the decisions and\r\nrecommendations it has laboured to negotiate and adopt. It\r\nthus constitutes a test of the credibility of the professions of\r\nfaith so often proclaimed over the resolve of the Member\r\nStates to make this Organization, as stipulated in\r\nArticle 1 (4) of the Charter:\r\n“a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the\r\nattainment of these common ends”.\r\nThe United Nations is about to celebrate solemnly the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of its foundation. This event makes the\r\nSecretary-General’s report of particular scope and\r\nsignificance this year. It is more than a mere yearly account\r\nof the Organization’s work. Indeed, one cannot read this\r\ndocument without bearing in mind the original mission of\r\nthe United Nations, its failures and successes, and its ability\r\nto respond to the aspirations of the people of the United\r\nNations who chose to unite their efforts in order to build a\r\nmore harmonious world of greater solidarity. This careful\r\nscrutiny of the United Nations activities and its incomplete\r\nachievements should not, however, make us lose sight of\r\nthe unavoidable truth that the Member States are primarily\r\nresponsible for its work, or make us forget that the\r\ndifficulties and shortcomings are due in part to the\r\nincreasingly frequent recourse made to the Organization,\r\nwhich is now being compelled to take action in many\r\ndifferent fields and to confront increasingly complex crises,\r\nwhile at the same time facing an acute financial crisis.\r\nThis past year has been particularly heavy for the\r\nUnited Nations. Undeniable successes have been achieved\r\nand there have been significant breakthroughs in\r\nnegotiations and in the discussion of certain questions. The\r\nreception of the new South Africa into the General\r\nAssembly was a brilliant political victory for our\r\nOrganization, whose firm position on the principles adopted\r\n20 years ago has thus been rewarded.\r\nThe restructuring of the United Nations has now\r\nentered a crucial stage. The adoption of resolution 48/264\r\non the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly,\r\ndespite its imperfections, has enabled this truly democratic\r\nand universal body somewhat to re-establish its powers to\r\ncoordinate and monitor all the activities of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe discussions on Security Council reform have\r\nhighlighted the need for equitable representation\r\naccompanied by an in-depth reform of its methods of\r\nwork and decision-making processes. Here, we would\r\nreiterate our belief in a reform of the Security Council\r\nthat would ensure fair representation, transparency and\r\ndemocracy in its functioning, and greater effectiveness\r\narising from a stronger confirmation of its legitimacy.\r\nIncreasing recourse to the International Court of\r\nJustice for the settlement of disputes is a healthy and\r\npositive trend bearing witness to a change of attitude in\r\nthe subjects of international law concerning the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. It also demonstrates\r\nthe prevalence of a greater awareness of the virtues of\r\nbuilding an international order based on law. Cooperation\r\nbetween the Court and the Security Council in connection\r\nwith the successful settlement of the dispute on the\r\nAouzou Strip illustrates the positive fallout for\r\ninternational peace and security whenever the potential of\r\nall United Nations bodies for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes is actually tapped.\r\nThe restructured Economic and Social Council held\r\nits first session this year. The substantive session was an\r\nenriching experience. However, the deplorable trend\r\ntowards the marginalization and reduced participation of\r\nthe developing countries, and Africa in particular, in that\r\norgan and its subsidiary bodies is for us grounds for\r\nlegitimate concern.\r\nSome of the Secretary-General’s initiatives in\r\nrestructuring the Secretariat with a view to enhancing its\r\neffectiveness and streamlining resource management are\r\ncommendable and we support them. It is imperative,\r\nhowever, that those Secretariat departments dealing with\r\neconomic and social issues take increasing account of the\r\nneeds of developing countries and pay careful heed to\r\ntheir requests. We should also like to express our support\r\nfor the Secretary-General’s initiatives aimed at\r\ndecentralizing the activities of the United Nations in the\r\neconomic and social sectors, which would particularly\r\nbenefit the regional economic commissions, whose great\r\npotential has yet to be fully exploited.\r\n“An Agenda for Development”, together with “An\r\nAgenda for Peace” should, in principle, offer an\r\nintegrated institutional and operational framework for\r\nUnited Nations activities. In this connection, I reaffirm\r\nour commitment to an integrated approach to peace and\r\ndevelopment. In this respect, we share the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s view on the need for:\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\n“thinking about the pursuit of development as a means\r\nof building foundations for enduring human progress”.\r\n(A/49/1, para. 5)\r\nLike the Secretary-General, we believe that the time has\r\ncome to stop simply acting upon the consequences or\r\nreacting to actual emergencies; rather, we should undertake\r\nserious action that would establish the basis for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The forthcoming World Summit on Social\r\nDevelopment is, in this respect, an excellent opportunity\r\nwhich mankind must seize in order to elaborate an\r\nambitious programme of action that will confront the\r\nchallenges and significant problems of our times.\r\nWe must recognize that the progress made in setting\r\nout concepts and policies, and even in drafting institutional\r\nand legal instruments, has been somewhat curtailed by the\r\nchronic financial crisis resulting from late payments of\r\ncontributions and a disturbing drop in resources earmarked\r\nfor development.\r\nThe Algerian delegation fully shares in this respect the\r\noft-stated concern of the Secretary-General, a concern that\r\nis clearly reflected in this year’s report.\r\nThe late payment of contributions places our\r\nOrganization in a precarious situation and greatly reduces\r\nits capacity for action. The first repercussions of this crisis\r\ncan already be seen in the area of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The dangerous\r\nconsequences of reductions in, or withdrawals of, peace-\r\nkeeping forces for financial reasons are well known: unless\r\na political solution is found, collapse there could once again\r\nbe appalling tragedies in countries such as Somalia and\r\nRwanda. With more and more devastating and murderous\r\nconflicts breaking out, the international community and the\r\nSecurity Council in particular should shoulder their\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, while fully respecting the sovereignty, territorial\r\nintegrity and independence of States.\r\nResources earmarked for operational activities related\r\nto development and humanitarian assistance are also\r\ndropping to dangerously low levels, thereby jeopardizing\r\nthe financing of any new projects for the developing\r\ncountries. This unfortunate trend could imperil whole\r\nsectors of multilateral economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. The current system of financing, based on\r\nvoluntary contributions, has to be reconsidered with a view\r\nto guaranteeing the reliability and predictability of the\r\nresources and finances that can be mobilized.\r\nOn another level, there has been no significant\r\nprogress this year towards the completion of the\r\ndecolonization process, which is still one of the priority\r\ntasks facing our Organization. Many peoples and\r\nterritories still under foreign domination are waiting for\r\nthe United Nations to shoulder its responsibility under the\r\nCharter and the Declaration on the Granting of\r\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. This is\r\nthe case of the people of Western Sahara, who wish to\r\nexercise their right to self-determination through a fair,\r\nfree and credible referendum carried out by the United\r\nNations in cooperation with the Organization of African\r\nUnity. Nothing should keep the United Nations from\r\nfulfilling that mission.\r\nIn reading the report of the Secretary-General, we\r\nare not only further enlightened as to the problems and\r\nchallenges facing us, but also become more aware of their\r\nscope. Fortunately, however, every year we find some\r\ngrounds for satisfaction that strengthen our belief that the\r\nUnited Nations has a valid mission and a universal\r\nmessage.\r\nWe can only hope that next year’s report, which will\r\ncoincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, will live up even more fully to our expectations\r\nand give us even more grounds for hope.\r\nMrs. Flores (Uruguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): First of all, my delegation wishes to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the report (A/49/1) that he has\r\nsubmitted on the work of the Organization. Uruguay\r\nconsiders that discussion of this report in the General\r\nAssembly gives Member States an excellent opportunity\r\nto exchange views on the functioning of the Organization,\r\nto evaluate results and to lay down guidelines for future\r\naction.\r\nA basic idea is set forth in the “Introduction” which,\r\nas we see it, underlies the entire development of the\r\ndocument - that is, to correct the mistaken impression that\r\nthe United Nations is devoting its attention almost\r\nexclusively to the maintenance of peace. Through a\r\ndescription of the Organization’s activities over the last\r\n12 months, the report attempts to show that the\r\nOrganization is playing a large role not only in the\r\nmaintenance of peace but also in the economic and social\r\nfields.\r\nMy delegation, broadly speaking, shares the\r\napproach taken in the report. However, we feel that it\r\nwould be interesting to go more deeply into some of the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nideas that are set forth in the document. Along these lines,\r\nthe global, integrated approach to the original purposes of\r\nthe Organization - peace, justice, human rights and\r\ndevelopment - should be supported by the adoption of\r\nconcrete measures that will ensure the appropriate\r\nfulfilment of those objectives.\r\nArticle 1, paragraph 1 of the Charter sets forth peace\r\nas the fundamental purpose of the Organization. The desire\r\nto strengthen the United Nations and make it more effective\r\nin the area of preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and\r\npeace-building was at the origin of the “Agenda for Peace”.\r\nIn that document, fundamental questions were raised, such\r\nas those mentioned in paragraph 400 of the present report.\r\nSome of the problems mentioned there remain unresolved.\r\nWe might mention, for example, the implementation of\r\nArticle 50 of the Charter.\r\nAs regards the specific issues that are dealt with in the\r\nchapter of the report of the Secretary-General entitled\r\n“Preventive diplomacy and peacemaking”, we wish to\r\nemphasize the establishment and good functioning of the\r\nSituation Centre. The work of the staff of this Centre has\r\nimproved communications between the missions in the\r\nfield, Headquarters and the troop-contributing countries.\r\nUruguay, as a troop-contributing country, feels that the\r\nfunctions of the Centre are vital to ensure that the\r\ncontributing countries receive the maximum amount of\r\ninformation. That is why we were surprised at the decision\r\nto suspend the distribution of the weekly report on the main\r\nevents relating to missions in the field. This report was\r\nespecially useful to the missions and provided a full\r\nunderstanding of events during the period under review.\r\nWe also wish to express our satisfaction at the\r\narrangements to establish the nucleus of a Planning Unit.\r\nThis will help in planning an operation during its initial\r\nstages and in coordinating its various elements in an\r\nintegrated manner. The same could be said of the efforts\r\nmade to strengthen the staff of the Office of the Military\r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General.\r\nAs for relations between the Secretariat and the\r\nGovernments that provide contingents, my delegation\r\nregards as very positive the initiatives that were taken to\r\nincrease the number of meetings between contributing\r\ncountries and the relevant offices in the area of each\r\nmission. Without prejudice to these meetings, within the\r\nframework of the Security Council, we should note the\r\nproposal contained in document S/1994/1063 to make the\r\nparticipation of troop-contributing countries in consultations\r\nmore flexible, especially when these relate to substantive\r\nissues of their respective mandates.\r\nWith the passage of time we see that peace and\r\ndevelopment are two closely related concepts. It has been\r\nsaid that peace is a key factor in the process of\r\ndevelopment and that international peace and security, in\r\nturn, will be truly guaranteed only if we eliminate the\r\nunderlying causes of conflicts. Thus economic and social\r\ndevelopment is seen as one of the bases for the\r\nconsolidation of international peace and security.\r\nThe international community wants to promote\r\neconomic and social progress among all peoples. This\r\ndesire was expressed by the General Assembly in its\r\nresolution 47/181 of 22 November 1992, which gave rise\r\nto the report “An Agenda for Development”. Despite the\r\nundeniable importance of this subject, we still do not have\r\nfirm proposals regarding the adoption of policies and\r\nmeasures that indicate a course of concrete and effective\r\naction.\r\nThe Organization is no longer a protagonist in\r\ndealing with macro-economic and financial problems. Its\r\nwork must be a counterpart to the efforts of the\r\ndeveloping countries to regain as far as possible the\r\nprivileges established by the Charter in the area of\r\neconomic development. A subsection of the report is\r\ndevoted to the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD). My delegation notes the\r\nactivities in this field that have occurred over the past\r\nyear. These have enhanced the effectiveness of this\r\nOrganization and its ability to operate.\r\nWhen it was set up in 1964 the intention was that\r\nUNCTAD would play an important role in the sphere of\r\neconomic cooperation. Although many of these matters\r\nare currently dealt with through the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund or, in the past, by the\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the fact is that\r\nUNCTAD is the only forum with a comprehensive\r\noverview of development and with the mandate and the\r\njurisdiction to enable it to tackle a broad range of\r\nimportant items in the context of global interdependence.\r\nThis is why, in our judgement, UNCTAD must be\r\nrevitalized even further; must recover its functions in the\r\nareas of coordination, analysis and negotiation of\r\neconomic policies world wide; and must be strengthened\r\nas an instrument of technical assistance for developing\r\ncountries.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nFurthermore, my delegation believes that UNCTAD\r\nmust act as a catalyst by creating a new international\r\nconsensus and new types of cooperation between developed\r\nand developing countries. We might also point to\r\nadministrative measures that are indispensable if UNCTAD\r\nis to be strengthened — including measures that relate to\r\nthe appointment of the body’s secretary-general.\r\nIn another area, the delegation of Uruguay supports\r\nthe Secretary-General’s initiative for the appointment of an\r\nadviser whose purpose would be to improve the\r\ncoordination of operational activities in the field of\r\ndevelopment. This would include strengthening the system\r\nof resident coordinators. The adviser would introduce\r\nconsistency in the area of policies and would improve\r\ncoordination within the United Nations — especially\r\ncoordination between the departments at Headquarters, the\r\nregional Commissions and the Funds and Programmes of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nParagraph 194 of the report refers to the concentration\r\nof the work of the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) in six areas: the alleviation of poverty,\r\nmanagement development, technical cooperation between\r\nthe developing countries, environment and natural resource\r\nmanagement, women in development, and technology for\r\ndevelopment. Uruguay suggests encouraging the designing\r\nof means for evaluating the concrete results achieved.\r\nParagraph 101 of the report deals with a point that\r\ngives rise to concern. I refer to the financial crisis that the\r\nOrganization is going through. The Secretary-General has\r\nhighlighted the serious cash flow situation in the\r\nOrganization, especially in respect of peace-keeping\r\nmissions. Cited once again as the main cause of the\r\nsituation is that some Member States are still failing to\r\ncomply with their obligation to pay their assessed\r\ncontributions fully and on time. My delegation shares the\r\nview — a view that has been expressed already — that if\r\nall Member States paid the amounts they owed, this\r\nproblem would be resolved.\r\nOn this point, my delegation understands that if\r\ncontributions were assessed on the basis of a State’s\r\ncapacity to pay, the impact of the payment of the quota\r\nwould be the same on all of the national economies. This\r\nsubject should be discussed thoroughly with the widest\r\npossible participation. The debate on that subject in the\r\nFifth Committee will undoubtedly be very useful.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to refer to several\r\nlegal problems that are mentioned in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report — the role of the International Court of\r\nJustice (ICJ); approval by the General Assembly of an\r\nagreement on the implementation of part XI of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, of\r\n10 December 1982; and approval by the International\r\nLaw Commission of the draft statute for a permanent\r\ninternational criminal court.\r\nCurrently there are 186 States parties to the Statute\r\nof the ICJ, and 58 States have declared their recognition\r\nof the binding jurisdiction of the Court under\r\nparagraphs 2 and 5 of Article 36 of the Statute. Uruguay\r\nwas the first country to sign the optional clause accepting\r\nthat jurisdiction. In 1921 we acceded to the Permanent\r\nCourt of International Justice, and under paragraph 5 of\r\nArticle 36 of the Statute of the ICJ this declaration\r\nremains in effect in respect of the International Court of\r\nJustice.\r\nIn the General Assembly just a few days ago my\r\ndelegation followed very carefully the introduction by the\r\nPresident of the ICJ, Mr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, of the\r\nreport on the Court. We share fully the views that the\r\nPresident of the Court expressed when he said that,\r\nalthough a renewed interest in the Court’s jurisdiction had\r\nbeen evident in recent years, the fundamental question\r\nwas not whether that body was extremely busy but,\r\nrather, whether it was fully occupying its rightful place in\r\nthe system for the maintenance of peace, as instituted by\r\nthe Charter.\r\nUruguay, as a maritime country, attaches great\r\nimportance to the entry into force of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. My country was one\r\nof the sponsors of resolution 48/263, which contains the\r\nagreement on the implementation of Part XI. In this\r\naction we were guided by the desire to see respect for the\r\nunitary nature of the Convention of 1982 and by the\r\ndesire to secure universal participation and support for the\r\nprinciples and norms set forth in the Convention.\r\nMy delegation is happy with the work that was\r\ndone by the International Law Commission at its forty-\r\nsixth session. In particular, we welcome the conclusion of\r\nthe draft statute for a permanent international criminal\r\ncourt. Although the tribunal that Uruguay favours would\r\nhave binding and exclusive jurisdiction, we feel that this\r\nhas been an important step in the area of the development\r\nof international law.\r\nMy delegation hopes that, with the advent of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the founding of this Organization,\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nthe guiding force that led in 1918 to the founding of the\r\nLeague of Nations and in 1945 to the creation of the United\r\nNations will now guide the international community as a\r\nwhole and enable us to respond appropriately to the\r\nchallenges that we shall face in the coming century.\r\nMr. Shah (Pakistan): My delegation would like to\r\nexpress its deep appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report on the work of the Organization, contained in\r\ndocument A/49/1.\r\nThe views already expressed by the Chairman of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, the Ambassador of Indonesia, and\r\nthe Chairman of the Group of 77, the Ambassador of\r\nAlgeria, enjoy the full support of the Pakistan delegation.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s comprehensive report truly\r\nmanifests his outstanding qualities as an academic and the\r\nvision he shows in his activities aimed at resolving the\r\nmany crises confronting the world. The report highlights the\r\nnumerous achievements of the Organization as well as the\r\nchallenges of the present which require an urgent and\r\nprompt response by this Assembly.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s earlier report entitled \"An\r\nAgenda for Development\" and the report under\r\nconsideration both reflect an incisive analysis of the\r\nmultiple dimensions of development as well as of the\r\nunique potential of our Organization to forge a global\r\nconsensus for multilateral action and an integrated approach\r\nencompassing all dimensions of the development challenge.\r\nMy delegation fully subscribes to the linkages established\r\nin the report between peace, economic growth,\r\nenvironmental protection, healthy social conditions,\r\ndemocracy and development. It also agrees that the\r\ndefinition of security in today’s world is no longer limited\r\nto questions of land and weapons but now includes\r\neconomic well-being, environmental sustainability and the\r\nprotection of human rights. As rightly pointed out by the\r\nSecretary-General, there is a direct relationship between\r\ninternational peace and security and development.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and the upcoming fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations present us with historic\r\nopportunities. These opportunities should be utilized to\r\nenhance global cooperation and create new ways to use the\r\noriginal aims of the Charter - justice, human rights and\r\ndevelopment - to establish a lasting foundation for\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe Pakistan delegation is particularly grateful to\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for drawing the\r\nattention of the world community, in paragraphs 541 and\r\n542 of his report, to the tensions and threat to peace\r\narising from the problems in Jammu and Kashmir. We\r\nwelcome his willingness to exert all possible efforts to\r\nfacilitate the search for a lasting solution to one of the\r\noldest unresolved conflicts, a conflict still on the United\r\nNations agenda. Despite assurances and commitments\r\nmade by the Indian leaders, the right to self-determination\r\nhas been denied to the oppressed peoples of Jammu and\r\nKashmir since 1947. The world has witnessed an\r\nunparalleled reign of terror, which has trampled the\r\nhuman rights of the civilians in that area. Forty-five\r\nthousand Kashmiris have been killed and thousands have\r\nbeen tortured or arbitrarily arrested.\r\nThe tensions generated by this dispute threaten both\r\nregional and international peace and security. My\r\ndelegation considers it imperative that the international\r\ncommunity intercede to promote a just and peaceful\r\nsolution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. ln this\r\ncontext, Pakistan has accepted the Secretary-General’s\r\noffer of good offices to facilitate the solution of this\r\ndispute. We hope India will also accept the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s offer.\r\nMs. Arystanbekova (Kazakhstan), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nMr. Muthaura (Kenya): I wish to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on the in-depth report he has\r\npresented to the General Assembly on the work of the\r\nOrganization over the last year. We pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General for the creative and far-sighted\r\nleadership he has continued to render to the Organization.\r\nKenya assures him of its cooperation and support in his\r\narduous task.\r\nThe Secretary-General has made a very able and\r\nthorough review of the operations the Organization has\r\nundertaken in the past 12 months, particularly those\r\nconcerning the implementation of the resolutions of\r\nUnited Nations organs. He has also set out in detail his\r\nvision of the future challenges facing the Organization in\r\nthe main areas of peace and security, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and social justice.\r\nMy delegation concurs with the Secretary-General’s\r\nview that the success of the United Nations in carrying\r\nout its mission will continue to depend principally on the\r\ncommitment of its Member States and of the general\r\npublic to the Organization. With the end of the cold war,\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nthere is renewed support for the Organization and therefore\r\nthe need to seize the opportunity to reinforce its moral\r\nauthority in the pursuit of its noble objectives as inscribed\r\nin the Charter.\r\nThe United Nations, like any other Organization,\r\ncannot function effectively without a sound financial base.\r\nAll of us, as Members of the Organization, have a\r\nresponsibility to ensure that the assessed contributions are\r\npaid on time and that the budget of the Organization is\r\nconsonant with the demands and the responsibilities that the\r\ngeneral membership puts on it.\r\nKenya is appreciative of the stress that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is placing on the need to balance appropriations for\r\npeace and security and those allocated to social and\r\neconomic development. It is of great interest to us that the\r\nSecretary-General has expressed particular concern\r\nregarding the need to strengthen the links between\r\nemergency assistance, rehabilitation and long-term\r\ndevelopment. We commend him for appointing the\r\nAdministrator of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, Mr. James Speth, to assist in shouldering the\r\noverall responsibility of improving the coordination of\r\noperational activities for development. In that regard, the\r\nstrategy to strengthen United Nations activities at the\r\nregional and national levels is most welcome.\r\nAs the United Nations reassesses itself for the\r\nforthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the Organization and\r\nmaps out its strategy for the future, Kenya subscribes to the\r\nview that a bottom-up approach in regard to international\r\npeace and security, sustainable development and social\r\njustice is the most effective way forward. Capacity-building\r\nat the national and regional levels as it relates to\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations, as well\r\nas general mobilization of the population in support of\r\nUnited Nations activities and the Organization’s response to\r\nlocal, national and regional concerns, cannot be\r\noveremphasized.\r\nMay I now comment on a few specific aspects of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. We welcome the progress made\r\nso far regarding reform of the Organization with a view to\r\nimproving the efficiency and administrative functioning of\r\nthe Organization. Chapter II of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport entitled \"Coordinating a comprehensive strategy\"\r\nhighlights, inter alia, the increased responsibility of the\r\nSecurity Council in the light of the numerous challenges to\r\ninternational peace and security that it is called upon to\r\naddress. With the demise of the cold war, the international\r\ncommunity has now reposed greater confidence in the role\r\nof the Organization. In this regard reform of the Security\r\nCouncil has acquired crucial importance and urgency.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the decision already made\r\nby the Assembly to extend the mandate of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. My delegation looks forward to the\r\nconclusion of the work of the Working Group during this\r\nsession. The extensive debate which has already taken\r\nplace over the item has substantially highlighted the\r\nurgent need for the reform of the Council, not only to\r\nenhance its efficiency, transparency and working methods,\r\nbut also to reflect a more realistic and equitable\r\nrepresentation of the general membership of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nOf crucial importance is the need for the Council to\r\nreflect equitable geographical representation. My\r\ndelegation has already expressed its views under agenda\r\nitem 33 of the Assembly and looks forward to participate\r\nfurther in the work of the Group.\r\nWe welcome the arrangements that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has already put in place with a view to servicing\r\nthe Council, including the appointment of a Special\r\nAdviser, at Under-Secretary-General level, to serve as his\r\npersonal representative to the Council.\r\nIn chapter III of the report, the Secretary-General\r\ndescribes development, humanitarian action and human\r\nrights as the foundations of peace. Building on \"An\r\nAgenda for Development\" submitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to the General Assembly in June 1994, the\r\nAssembly has devoted several meetings to an in-depth\r\ndiscussion of the Agenda. Lively discussion of the\r\nAgenda also took place at the World Hearings on\r\nDevelopment, convened by the President of the General\r\nAssembly last June, as well as at the Economic and\r\nSocial Council session, also held in June 1994.\r\nIn this regard we welcome the proposal by the\r\nSecretary-General to strengthen the links between\r\nemergency assistance, rehabilitation and long-term\r\ndevelopment. The Secretary-General’s decision to entrust\r\nthe Administrator of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) with overall responsibility for\r\nassisting him in improving coordination activities for\r\ndevelopment is particularly welcomed by our delegation.\r\nIt is our strong conviction that the United Nations has an\r\nimportant role to play in matters of development.\r\nWhereas the donor community and the Bretton Woods\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\ninstitutions have an important role to play in this regard, the\r\nexperiences of many developing countries, including my\r\nown, is that these organizations tend to impose — although\r\nnot intended — policies that tend to have very adverse\r\neffects on vulnerable members of society. The structural\r\nadjustment programmes, though usually necessary, need to\r\nbe accompanied by safety nets that can cushion the\r\nvulnerable groups from the adverse effects that usually\r\naccompany such programmes.\r\nIn this regard, we look forward to the major\r\nforthcoming world conferences where some of these issues\r\nwill be discussed in detail. In particular, the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development to be held in Copenhagen next year\r\nis expected to articulate a programme of action for the\r\ninternational community in this vital field. That Conference\r\nmust contend with the reality that the social situation of\r\npeople cannot be improved without, in general, improved\r\neconomic conditions.\r\nMy delegation has noted with great concern, the\r\nobservation in paragraph 188 of the report that there has\r\nbeen a considerable downturn in resources for operational\r\nactivities of the Organization. In particular, the resource\r\nallocations to some of the organizations whose mandates\r\nare of critical importance to developing countries such as\r\nUNDP, the United Nations Environment Programme\r\n(UNEP), the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements\r\n(Habitat), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)\r\nand the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) have\r\nbeen going down. The Secretary-General’s report clearly\r\ndemonstrates the necessity to strengthen the capacity of\r\nthese organizations to enable them to cope with their\r\nincreased responsibilities, especially as envisaged in chapter\r\n38 of Agenda 21. Paragraph 181 of the report specifically\r\npoints out that despite the clear call by Agenda 21 for\r\nUNEP to be given greater expertise and additional\r\nresources, resource constraints are continuing to affect its\r\nactivities in a number of programme areas such as energy,\r\nenvironmental health, atmosphere and environmental\r\nassessment.\r\nWe also note the observation that resources remain the\r\nmost important challenge facing Habitat in preparing for the\r\nHabitat II Conference. UNDP has experienced a 15 per cent\r\nreduction in core resources, while UNICEF faced a serious\r\nreversal in contributions in 1993, bringing the level down\r\nby $150 million from the peak in 1992 of $688 million.\r\nUNFPA experienced a drop in contributions of\r\n$18.4 million in 1993 from $238 million in 1992.\r\nThis situation should not be allowed to continue.\r\nThere is clear evidence that the Organization’s resources\r\ncontinue to be directed towards peace-keeping and\r\nhumanitarian budgets at the expense of development. We\r\nwish to reiterate what the Secretary-General has himself\r\npointed out that development must be given priority as it\r\nis the foundation of peace.\r\nWith specific regard to UNEP, it is pointed out in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report that UNEP provides the\r\nsecretariats for the following five international\r\nconventions: the Convention on Biological Diversity; the\r\nConvention on the Control of Transboundary Movements\r\nof Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal; the Montreal\r\nProtocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer to\r\nthe Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone\r\nLayer; the Convention on International Trade in\r\nEndangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna; and the\r\nConvention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of\r\nWild Animals.\r\nFurthermore, the programme continues to coordinate\r\nand support 13 regional sea programmes, nine of which\r\nare based upon regional conventions.\r\nThus UNEP has built considerable expertise in\r\nservicing the environmental conventions. The\r\nRio de Janeiro Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment also underscored the role of UNEP as the\r\nlead agency in the United Nations system on\r\nenvironmental issues. For these reasons, we are convinced\r\nthat the permanent secretariats of the new environmental\r\nconventions should also be located with UNEP in\r\nNairobi; these include biological diversity, climate change\r\nand desertification. This would indeed be consistent with\r\nthe wish of the General Assembly and the decisions of\r\nthe Governing Council of UNEP which have consistently\r\ncalled for the strengthening, harmonization, cost-\r\neffectiveness and enhancement of the efficiency of UNEP\r\nand indeed of other United Nations programmes.\r\nWith regard to section D of chapter III entitled “The\r\nhumanitarian imperative”, the Secretary-General has\r\nelaborated on the measures that he has put in place to\r\nstrengthen coordination among the various actors in the\r\nhumanitarian, political and peace-keeping activities of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe wish to emphasize that the United Nations needs\r\nto strengthen its capacity to respond to situations\r\nrequiring preventive diplomacy so as to avoid\r\ncatastrophes of the type we recently witnessed in Rwanda.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nMr. Butler (Australia): We wish to express our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nand forward-looking report on the work of the organization\r\n(A/49/1).\r\nThe report demonstrates clearly the challenges and\r\nopportunities which now face the United Nations in an\r\nincreasingly complex global environment. It also outlines\r\nthe significant action which has been taken in many areas\r\nduring the past year to strengthen the role and functioning\r\nof the Organization to respond effectively to those\r\nchallenges and opportunities.\r\nThe Secretary-General emphasizes that the new\r\ninternational context and the multidimensional nature of the\r\nchallenges call for multilateral action and an integrated\r\napproach, and we agree. Our shared objective must be one\r\nof cooperating for peace through strengthening cooperative\r\nsecurity in all of its manifestations.\r\nAs the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator\r\nGareth Evans, stated three weeks ago during the general\r\ndebate:\r\n\"The distinction between peace and security on\r\nthe one hand and development on the other has too\r\noften been a matter for sterile and unhelpful debate,\r\nwith attempts to trade off one for the other as key\r\ngoals for the United Nations. Any viable modern\r\nconcept of international peace, let alone peace within\r\nStates, must recognize that the two are indissolubly\r\nbound up with each other: there can be no sustainable\r\npeace without development, and no development\r\nwithout peace.\" (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 15th\r\nmeeting, p. 8)\r\nFor these reasons, Australia welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts in producing an Agenda for Development,\r\nfollowing on, as it does, from “An Agenda for Peace”.\r\nAmong other important considerations, it recognizes the\r\nrelationship between peace and development,\r\nacknowledging that equitable development eradicates many\r\nof the socio-political conditions in which threats to peace\r\nbreed. And — this is very important — it places emphasis\r\non individual human beings as the subjects and\r\nbeneficiaries of our development efforts. It recognizes that\r\neconomies should serve people.\r\nWe also applaud the focus the Secretary-General has\r\nplaced on practical international cooperation for global\r\nhuman security, for example in the areas of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance, effective governance and the key\r\nsocial issues which form the agenda of the World Summit\r\non Social Development.\r\nA more integrated effort will clearly be required —\r\nrequired of the United Nations system — if the objectives\r\nset out in the Agenda for Development are to be\r\nachieved. It is imperative that we improve the system’s\r\nability to develop and implement social and economic\r\ndevelopment programmes in a more coordinated and\r\ncoherent manner, including finding ways to allow the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and United Nations bodies to\r\nwork in closer harmony. But more than this will be\r\nrequired, including changes in the senior decision-making\r\nstructure of the United Nations Secretariat. Considerable\r\nreform in the intergovernmental elements of the United\r\nNations system has been achieved and is being worked\r\nout, but the same is not true of the Secretariat itself.\r\nNotwithstanding some welcome recent changes —\r\nincluding, in particular, the appointment of the Special\r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General for Operational\r\nActivities — Australia believes that there continues to be\r\na strong case for creating a new working collegiate\r\nexecutive of four Deputy Secretaries-General to work\r\nwith the Secretary-General responsible, respectively, for\r\neconomic and social affairs, peace and security affairs,\r\nhumanitarian affairs and administration and management.\r\nOne of the most crucial elements in any functioning\r\nsystem of cooperative security is an effective capacity for\r\npreventive diplomacy. We are therefore pleased to note\r\nthat the Secretary-General’s report contains an extensive\r\nchapter on expanding the role of the United Nations in\r\npreventive diplomacy and conflict resolution, in which, as\r\nthe report records, considerable progress has been made\r\nin a number of areas since the publication of “An Agenda\r\nfor Peace”.\r\nAustralia is convinced that the United Nations can\r\nand should do more in this respect to prevent disputes\r\nfrom escalating into armed conflicts. This can be done in\r\ntoday’s world; it must be done and there is abundant\r\nevidence that prevention is not only preferable but also\r\nless costly than cure. To give further impetus to this\r\nprocess we propose to introduce at the current session a\r\ndraft resolution on enhancing preventive diplomacy. We\r\nbelieve that there is widespread support for the United\r\nNations to build strong preventive diplomacy\r\nmachinery — to develop the capacity, foreseen by its\r\nfounders and articulated in Article 33 of the Charter, to\r\noperate as an active agent in the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nThe Organization would be able to operate more\r\neffectively in this area by giving its staff additional skills in\r\ndispute resolution and in conflict management. We\r\ncommend its efforts to do so through the fellowship course\r\nof the United Nations Institute for Training and Research\r\n(UNITAR), and Australia will continue to provide backing\r\nfor this training. We propose that the United Nations\r\ndevelop a dispute-resolution service within its Secretariat.\r\nWe advocate strengthening the Department of Political\r\nAffairs and increasing coordination, information sharing and\r\nearly warning capacity amongst and between the various\r\nelements of the United Nations system. Greater use should\r\nalso be made of the resources of Member States and\r\nstronger linkages forged with regional security\r\narrangements.\r\nSuch regional organizations and arrangements can\r\nthemselves play a very useful role, but we must have\r\nrealistic expectations of them because most cannot match\r\nthe capacity of global bodies to marshal resources for\r\npeace-building or, at the other end of the scale, for military\r\nresponses to crises. They nevertheless offer a way of\r\nbringing together the parties to disputes in a constructive\r\nand non-confrontational framework.\r\nWe welcome recent developments to strengthen\r\nregional approaches, in particular the recent inaugural\r\nmeeting of the regional forum of the Association of South-\r\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with its evident willingness\r\nto develop preventive diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nWe hope others will share our interest in exploring the\r\nscope for establishing regional peace and security resource\r\ncentres to advance these objectives under the banner of\r\nregional organizations or the United Nations itself, or both.\r\nThe role which preventive diplomacy can play in\r\ncontributing to cooperative security is vital. Earlier this\r\nweek, for example, the General Assembly adopted a\r\nresolution which addressed the situation in the Central\r\nAfrican Republic of Burundi, a country which is proving to\r\nbe a test case for international efforts at preventive\r\ndiplomacy. It was not until the tragic events in Rwanda\r\nearlier this year that the international community’s attention\r\nwas drawn properly to the situation in Burundi. Given the\r\nhistorical links between the two countries and their similar\r\ninternal tensions, it was only natural that Burundi was seen\r\nas vulnerable to the same tragic events that had gripped\r\nRwanda. Although the situation in Burundi remains fragile,\r\npeace does prevail there, and this is partly owing to the\r\npreventive steps taken by the international community,\r\nwhich have helped allow Burundi to avoid following in\r\nRwanda’s path.\r\nThrough consultations between the political parties,\r\ncarried out in a spirit of reconciliation, a new President\r\nhas been invested in Burundi and a new Government has\r\nbeen formed. The efforts of the international community\r\nat preventive action in Burundi have been encouraging,\r\nbut they need to be sustained. As the Secretary-General\r\nnoted in a recent report on Burundi,\r\n“Compared with the exorbitant amounts that would\r\nhave been needed for emergency assistance if the\r\nRwandese tragedy were repeated in Burundi, the\r\nprice to be paid for prevention today seems\r\nminimal”. (S/1994/1152, para. 47)\r\nThe Secretary-General observes in his report that the\r\nfiftieth anniversary year, which I might mention began at\r\nmidnight four days ago,\r\n“represents an exhilarating challenge and an\r\ninvaluable opportunity to forge a global consensus\r\nbehind development, in all of its dimensions, as the\r\nmost lasting foundation for international peace and\r\nsecurity and as the greatest hope for all humanity”.\r\n(para. 12)\r\nWe Australians fully endorse this view. We also believe\r\nthat an integral part of the new approach the United\r\nNations must take to meet this challenge is to give greater\r\nemphasis to the role that preventive diplomacy, in all of\r\nits manifestations, can play. We can do more to\r\nstrengthen the contribution that preventive diplomacy can\r\nmake to international peace and security, and we can do\r\nthis at this session of the General Assembly. It is an\r\nopportunity that we should seize.\r\nMr. Remirez de Estenoz Barciela (Cuba)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): The discussion under item\r\n10 of the agenda is probably one of the most important of\r\nthis session. Its importance lies precisely in the fact that,\r\nas we approach the commemoration of the first half-\r\ncentury of this Organization, the debate grows stronger on\r\nwhat the Organization should be in the future, what its\r\npowers and aims should be and how it should act to face\r\nthe enormous challenges confronting mankind during the\r\nfinal years of the millennium.\r\nMy delegation has examined the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport with great care, and we agree in essence with the\r\nstatement made by the Chairman of the Movement of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries, which contains many of the\r\ndoubts and concerns that Cuba shares.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nIt is impossible to include in a single statement the\r\nwide-ranging ideas contained in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. Therefore we will confine ourselves to a number of\r\nnecessary reflections and to commenting on concepts that\r\nwe consider erroneous, while the Cuban delegation will\r\ncontinue to comment on the elements contained in this\r\nreport both in plenary meetings and in the Main\r\nCommittees of this forty-ninth session.\r\nIt is gratifying to find in the Introduction of this\r\ndocument a number of ideas that in our opinion should\r\nmake up the essence of the work of the United Nations at\r\nthis stage of its history. We consider that the emphasis\r\nupon the issue of development is crucial, and in this context\r\nwe find it appropriate that the Secretary-General is\r\ndetermined\r\n“to correct the common misperception of the United\r\nNations as an Organization dedicated primarily to\r\npeace-keeping”. (para. 1)\r\nBut this Organization itself is probably to blame for\r\nthat misperception. In the euphoria of these few last years\r\nit may have forgotten the multidisciplinary nature of its role\r\nand may have concentrated excessively on peace-keeping\r\nand related activities. We have observed with concern on\r\nmany occasions how most of the resources at the disposal\r\nof the international community for multilateral activities\r\nhave been devoted to peace-keeping while ignoring other\r\nfields, such as economic and social development, which\r\nshould constitute areas of priority attention.\r\nIt likewise does not seem appropriate that, as stated in\r\nthe report, the international community is obligated to\r\nredefine the concept of development. This Organization is\r\nnot new, nor are the economic and social problems that\r\naffect a large part of mankind. For decades this\r\nOrganization has adopted hundreds of documents that\r\nclearly define, in one way or another, what development is\r\nand what role this Organization should play in the efforts\r\nto extend the benefits of progress to all and to create just\r\nand equitable international economic relations in the world.\r\nWe do not have to prepare new definitions of\r\ndevelopment, nor do we have to adopt new agendas that\r\nignore the achievements of decades and, moveover, contain\r\nconcepts that are frequently not acceptable to all States, in\r\nparticular those that would most benefit from development.\r\nWe must be capable of creating conditions for the\r\nemergence of a true political willingness to promote\r\ndevelopment on a world-wide scale and to recognize as the\r\nmain role of the United Nations the management of\r\ninternational cooperation to that end, as the report itself\r\nstates.\r\nThus, even if we agree that various elements in\r\ntoday’s world are closely related, we must not ignore the\r\nfact that development occupies the highest place. There\r\ncan be no peace without development, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself has recognized on more than one\r\noccasion; without development there can be no guarantee\r\nof stopping the deterioration of the environment; without\r\ndevelopment true social justice cannot be promoted; and\r\nthere can be no true democracy, either within or between\r\nStates, without an accelerated advance towards economic\r\nand social development.\r\nWe are surprised that the philosophical foundations\r\nof the report do not give due attention to the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter — which is the cornerstone of\r\nthe work of this Organization — or to the manner in\r\nwhich they will be applied in the future. We find it also\r\nsurprising that the report does not refer in a precise\r\nmanner to the main objective of the United Nations: to\r\npromote international cooperation in a wide range of\r\nfields. We think that these issues cannot be disregarded\r\nand that the Member States should rectify this regrettable\r\nomission, especially in periods that are tending to clear\r\nthe ground for such equivocal concepts as that of \"limited\r\nsovereignty\", when interference in the internal affairs of\r\nStates is increasingly practised and when attempts are\r\nfrequently made to replace cooperation with coercion.\r\nThe Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned\r\nCountries clearly recalled the positions of the Movement\r\nregarding some of the most important issues concerning\r\nthe ongoing restructuring of this Organization.\r\nNevertheless, I would like to place on record that the\r\ndescription of the various principal organs contained in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report is also illustrative in this\r\nregard. For example, figure 4, which appears on page 5\r\nof the report, contrasts the increase in informal\r\nconsultations of the whole of the Security Council with\r\nthe increase in the Council’s formal meetings. This\r\nclearly shows why the work of the Security Council\r\nrequires a greater transparency.\r\nSimilarly, reference is made throughout the report to\r\nthe restructuring of the Secretariat, and we believe that\r\nthe legislative mandates of the organs of the United\r\nNations have not been adequately respected in all cases.\r\nWe must not forget, in this context, that the priorities of\r\nthis Organization can only be determined by its Member\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nStates. We hope that this rule will not continue to be\r\nignored in the future.\r\nBy the same token, the Secretariat is also\r\nautonomously carrying out other activities which, in\r\npractice, tend to create conditions for the introduction of\r\nchanges that the majority of Member States do not want.\r\nFor example, in paragraph 383 of the report, there is a\r\nreference to discussions between the Centre for Human\r\nRights and the Department of Peace-keeping Operations on\r\nways and means of securing the further support of the\r\nCentre in peace-keeping operations. We should be wary of\r\nthe precedent that activities of this nature can create.\r\nWe must also be careful about current concepts linked\r\nto this trend. Among them is so-called “humanitarian\r\npreventive action”, which, though it may appear\r\ncommendable, contains a great potential for interventionism\r\nthat must be avoided.\r\nWe are also concerned by the imbalance in the report\r\nbetween the various activities to be carried out by the\r\nOrganization. Only a small portion of the report is truly\r\ndevoted to development and yet, despite this, elements\r\nregarding humanitarian assistance and human rights are\r\nadded to it. On the other hand, and in contrast, practically\r\nthe entire text is permeated one way or another with the\r\nconcept of preventive diplomacy. It would seem as if,\r\nrather than a report on the work of the United Nations for\r\nthe year, we were examining a second edition of the\r\ndocument “An Agenda for Peace”.\r\nIn the statement I had the honour to make last year on\r\nthis item, I referred to our concern regarding the\r\nsubordination of third world development to the\r\nimplementation of new concepts allegedly addressing the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We also\r\nexpressed our concern about the change in priorities\r\nrepresented by the loss of the necessary balance between\r\npeace-keeping and the obligations of the United Nations in\r\nthe field of international cooperation for development.\r\nThe approach prevailing in this year’s report has also\r\ninverted the priorities of the Organization, a phenomenon\r\nwhich seems to be on its way to becoming a rule. Does the\r\nSecretariat not consider it worth while to promote the\r\nrenewal of a serious and meaningful North-South dialogue?\r\nDoes the Secretariat, which feels empowered to devote\r\npriority attention to preventive diplomacy and peacemaking,\r\nnot feel equally empowered to offer its good offices for the\r\nestablishment of a more just and equitable international\r\neconomic order? Is not the achievement of development\r\nthe best means for the effective prevention of conflicts?\r\nWe agree with the aim of trying to avoid human\r\ntragedies brought about by armed conflict, but\r\nunderdevelopment, poverty, malnutrition and lack of\r\naccess to adequate health care are more costly today in\r\nterms of human lives than all the wars being waged on\r\nour planet. Is the proportion of three-to-one between the\r\nresources being devoted to peace-keeping and related\r\nactivities and those devoted to development appropriate?\r\nObviously, priorities are being inverted and even the most\r\ncursory glance through the report shows this to be so.\r\nThis equation inevitably prompts us to address an\r\nissue that has been receiving much attention lately. We\r\nare referring to the Organization’s so-called “financial\r\ncrisis”. We have our doubts that this is the appropriate\r\nterm for this situation. It would seem that what we\r\nactually have is a “cash-flow crisis”. It has not been\r\ndemonstrated that the financial structures of the\r\nOrganization and their operating mechanisms, such as the\r\ndifferent scales of assessments, are in crisis. If we\r\ncompare the figures of the Organization’s debts, provided\r\nby the Secretariat itself, against the figure of monies\r\nowed to the Organization, the assertion I made earlier\r\nwould seem to be confirmed. Thus we see no need to\r\ncarry out the radical changes proposed to satisfy a few\r\nbig Powers nor to go against the established procedures\r\nfor the discussion of budgetary issues by setting aside the\r\nFifth Committee of this General Assembly.\r\nOn the other hand, we cannot lose sight of the fact\r\nthat the large expenses incurred in the past few years\r\nhave come through peace-keeping operations. We should\r\nfirst determine whether those expenses have really been\r\njustified, whether they have responded to the interests of\r\nthe Organization as a whole, and whether they are in line\r\nwith the priorities accepted by the majority of Member\r\nStates. Then, and only then, should we review the\r\nfinancial procedures of this Organization.\r\nLastly, I should like to refer to issues related to\r\npeace-keeping. It continues to amaze us that nowhere in\r\nthe report is there mentioned the principles that should\r\ngovern these operations and their related activities —\r\nessentially, the consent of the parties involved in a\r\nconflict, as a necessary precondition to the establishment\r\nof a peace-keeping operation. We are concerned by the\r\ngrowing practice of having the Security Council “license”\r\ncertain States or groups of States to resolve specific\r\nsituations, which also seems to be legitimized by the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nreport, as is the tendency to encourage the United Nations\r\nthrough peace-keeping operations or other related activities\r\nto interfere in issues that fall exclusively within the internal\r\njurisdiction of States. Further comment on the unpredictable\r\nconsequences of these actions is unnecessary.\r\nWe have made a few comments on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report for this year and, above all, on its\r\nunderlying philosophy. We continue to disagree with the\r\nSecretary-General on a number of issues and concepts, but\r\nwe agree with him on many others. As always, we are\r\nready to show flexibility and to try to find, through\r\ndialogue and negotiation among Member States, common\r\nviews that will allow the United Nations to meet the second\r\nhalf of its first century of existence with a truly human face\r\nand with priorities that truly respond to the interests of\r\nmankind as a whole, and not just a part of it.\r\nMr. Pashovski (Bulgaria): Our deliberations at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly are being held at an\r\nimportant time in the life of the United Nations, since we\r\nare on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization. It is therefore our duty to cast a glance\r\nbackwards at past successes and problems and to take stock\r\nof them. In doing so, it is all the more necessary to keep\r\nour minds focused on the future and on the need to adapt\r\nthe Organization to present-day challenges and those yet to\r\ncome.\r\nThe past year has marked further progress in the\r\nprocess of restructuring the social and economic sector of\r\nthe Organization and in efforts to strengthen its role and\r\neffectiveness in the area of international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. The evolving perception that peace, economic\r\ngrowth, the environment, social justice and democracy are\r\ninterlocking and mutually reinforcing has been widely\r\nrecognized. The need for a comprehensive innovative\r\napproach to development has gained wide support. In this\r\ncontext, particular importance should be attached to the\r\nfurther discussions on the report of the Secretary-General\r\non “An Agenda for Development”. We share the view that\r\n“An Agenda for Development” should be aimed at making\r\nthe United Nations more responsive to new development\r\nrealities. Identifying ways and means of harmonizing and\r\ncoordinating the interrelationships between peace and\r\ndevelopment and the manner they are dealt with deserves\r\nadequate attention.\r\nEfforts to restructure and revitalize the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations, bearing in mind the requirements\r\nmentioned earlier, should be continued. Since its creation\r\nthe United Nations has evolved as a unique international\r\nbody in which all pressing issues, across the political,\r\neconomic and social spectrum can be approached in an\r\nintegrated manner. It has increased responsibilities and\r\nplays a greater role today; the cold war and bipolar\r\nconfrontation have come to an end, but the international\r\ncommunity faces new challenges and threats.\r\nWe are confident that the restructuring of the United\r\nNations economic and social sectors will ensure a better\r\nbalance in the activities of the Organization and will\r\nmake it more responsive to and more effective in dealing\r\nwith the interrelated problems of development. In this\r\ncontext, it is our strong belief that the United Nations will\r\ncontinue to give due attention to the problems of the\r\ncountries in transition. The reinforcement of the United\r\nNations system for operational activities and a more\r\nactive cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions are important elements in this\r\nprocess.\r\nAlong with increased attention to and concern for\r\nthe socio-economic dimension of security, the trend\r\ntowards expanding the involvement of the United Nations\r\nin preventive diplomacy and crisis management that we\r\nhave witnessed in recent years should be further upheld\r\nand promoted. Bulgaria has traditionally acknowledged\r\nand supported making better use of the instruments for\r\nthe prevention of conflicts and crises, and we welcome\r\nthe substantive progress made in that area.\r\nAnother major component of the Organization’s\r\nconflict- resolution efforts is the growing involvement of\r\nthe United Nations in peace-keeping throughout the\r\nworld. We welcome the efforts to enhance its peace-\r\nkeeping capacity in a changing world. As peace-keeping\r\noperations become more complex, dangerous and\r\nexpensive, special attention should be given to such\r\npressing issues as enhancing the Organization’s\r\ninstitutional framework in the area of peace-keeping, the\r\nsearch for ways and means to solve the financial\r\nproblems related to peace-keeping operations, and the\r\nimperative need to ensure a greater level of safety and\r\nsecurity for peace-keeping personnel.\r\nSignificant progress has been made in these areas.\r\nWe support the development of the system of “stand-by\r\narrangements”, and have already committed national\r\nresources for use in United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations. We are actively contributing to the work on an\r\ninternational convention dealing with safety and security\r\nof United Nations and associated personnel. We share the\r\ngrowing concern over existing problems in the financial\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\naspects of peace-keeping. Therefore, we join those who call\r\nfor redoubling the efforts to seek answers to those\r\nquestions.\r\nOn the topic of the comprehensive array of preventive\r\nand enforcement measures to solve conflicts, let me recall\r\nthat Bulgaria attaches extreme importance to the issues\r\nrelated to devising an overall mechanism for the\r\nimplementation of Article 50 of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. We are in favour of devising such a mechanism,\r\nwhich would guarantee the equitable sharing of the\r\neconomic burden by the whole international community.\r\nThe cooperation of the United Nations with regional\r\norganizations is an essential element of the evolving new\r\ninternational system of security and stability. Bulgaria was\r\namong the initiators of the process of cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),\r\nand consistently supports its promotion. It is also our desire\r\nto see a closer link between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe. We think that stronger interaction\r\nbetween the two organizations is possible, especially in the\r\narea of human rights issues and in the efforts towards\r\nconflict prevention, post-conflict peace-building and the\r\nconsolidation of democratic institutions. A good starting\r\npoint in this regard is the existing framework of tripartite\r\nmeetings between the Council of Europe, the CSCE and the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to underscore the\r\nsignificance my country attaches to the overall process of\r\nreforming and adapting the Organization to the new\r\nchallenges of our time, and to reaffirm our dedication and\r\ncommitment to this process.\r\nMr. Vilchez (Nicaragua) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Nicaragua, as a member of the Movement of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries and the Group of 77, fully supports\r\nthe statements made by the Permanent Representatives of\r\nIndonesia and Algeria on this subject. Nevertheless, we\r\nwould like to state Nicaragua’s position on such an\r\nimportant document as the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the work of the Organization, for which we would like\r\nto express our special gratitude.\r\nIn 1995 the United Nations will turn 50. Our\r\nOrganization, created in San Francisco to save humankind\r\n“from the scourge of war”, will then have the opportunity\r\nto undertake a thorough study of the achievements and\r\nerrors made during that historic period, so full of hope,\r\nwhich saw the rebirth of the great ideal of democracy.\r\nThe 1980s in particular bore clear witness to a\r\nmonumental change of a historical, political and social\r\nnature. Our United Nations has today become a beacon\r\nsignalling a safe haven from upheavals caused by\r\nconflicts of all kinds. The hopes of all humankind are\r\ntoday placed in our Organization.\r\nIn his recently published report on the work of the\r\nOrganization the Secretary-General states:\r\n“During the period covered by this, my third annual\r\nreport, I have sought to correct the common\r\nmisperception of the United Nations as an\r\norganization dedicated primarily to peace-keeping.\r\nEconomic and social questions have long occupied\r\nthe major part of United Nations efforts. Such work\r\nhas become all the more important today precisely\r\nas conflicts are increasingly recognized to have\r\neconomic and social origins.” (A/49/1, para. 1).\r\nIn this context, we consider that our Organization\r\nmust devote itself with renewed vigour to the struggle\r\nagainst inequity and injustice. The United Nations must\r\nnot only be the bearer of hope, but must fulfil its\r\ncommitments in the economic and social areas, working\r\nhard to achieve at least a minimal improvement in the\r\nliving conditions of humankind. The Organization must\r\nmeet this historic challenge, updating its methods, making\r\nbetter use of the experience it has accumulated and trying\r\nto optimize the availability of resources, which are\r\ninadequate to carry out at the same time three essential\r\ntasks: the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\neconomic and social development and the protection of\r\nthe environment for future generations.\r\nIt is a matter of concern that even as the United\r\nNations has increased its responsibilities, especially as\r\nregards peace-keeping operations, it is left defenceless in\r\na deep and almost permanent financial crisis. The\r\ninternational community must give financing top priority,\r\nbut it must be complemented by rational management of\r\nexisting resources, and the General Assembly must be\r\nable to assess the effectiveness of the measures taken by\r\nthe Secretary-General in establishing a more direct\r\nstructure of responsibility of States. We also welcome the\r\ncreation of the Office of Internal Oversight Services,\r\nheaded by an Under-Secretary-General.\r\nThe multidimensional character of the United\r\nNations is reflected in the increasing responsibilities of its\r\norgans and specialized agencies. The General Assembly\r\nis playing a more valuable role in international relations,\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nso it is important that the role of its President be\r\nstrengthened. One of the most important tasks facing us this\r\nsession is the restructuring of the United Nations. Hence,\r\nthe approach to reform and restructuring must be\r\ncomprehensive and balanced. We must promote a more\r\nbalanced relationship between the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretary-General, in accordance\r\nwith the provisions of the Charter.\r\nGeneral Assembly sessions have seen an increase in\r\nthe number of agenda items. We welcome the growing\r\ntendency to adopt draft resolutions by consensus and the\r\nincreasing participation of Heads of State and Government\r\nin the General Assembly’s general debates. We must also\r\nhighlight the importance of the General Assembly’s\r\nestablishment of an open-ended working group to deal with\r\nthe question of equitable representation on and an increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council.\r\nWe are particularly happy to see that all matters\r\nrelating to human rights are appropriately reflected in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. The report contains pertinent\r\nreferences to the various activities of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, who is now charged with\r\nthe promotion and protection of all civil, cultural,\r\neconomic, political and social rights. Our delegation is\r\npleased with the manner in which Ambassador José Ayala\r\nLasso is carrying out his mandate.\r\nAs the Secretary-General says, the High Commissioner\r\nhas principal responsibility for human rights activities\r\nwithin the United Nations. My delegation considers it\r\nappropriate that, as part of the process of restructuring to\r\nincrease the effectiveness of our efforts in the field of\r\nhuman rights, we should try to coordinate the tasks of all\r\nthe competent bodies and allocate the necessary financial\r\nresources for this important work.\r\nThe steady increase in the work of the Security\r\nCouncil has aroused great interest among States Members\r\nof the Organization. We agree with the point made by\r\nmany delegations that there must be greater transparency in\r\nthe Security Council’s methods of work. There is almost\r\nuniversal interest and support for considering the question\r\nof increasing the membership of the Council with a view to\r\nbringing its work into line with current international\r\nrealities.\r\nWe are therefore satisfied with the Council’s decision\r\nto set up a working group to study the question of how its\r\nmethods of work could be improved with a view to\r\nachieving, among other things, greater transparency. In this\r\ncontext, we should like to refer to the report (A/49/2)\r\npresented by the Council to the General Assembly. In\r\nspite of its very large size, this does not seem to be a\r\ndocument of substance. The report should be analytical\r\nrather than descriptive. It should deal with all the\r\nquestions discussed by the Security Council and should\r\ncontain a detailed evaluation of the work of the Council’s\r\nspecial committees.\r\nIn 1992 the General Assembly welcomed the\r\nSecretary-General’s report entitled “An Agenda for\r\nPeace”, and in September 1993 the Assembly adopted a\r\nsecond resolution on this subject. The Security Council\r\nhas held a number of meetings to deal with specific\r\nproposals on “An Agenda for Peace”. The Agenda has led\r\nto many concrete reforms in the United Nations system\r\nthrough the adoption of tangible measures. We applaud\r\nthe adoption of these measures recommended by the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nWe endorse, albeit with some concern, what has\r\nbeen achieved through preventive diplomacy and\r\ninitiatives in the field of peace-keeping operations as well\r\nas instruments for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. These operations, so long as they are carried\r\nout appropriately, can be very beneficial. The sums\r\nrequired are minimal by comparison with the inevitable\r\nenormous cost, in terms of human suffering and material\r\ndamage, of war and continued conflict. We congratulate\r\nthe Secretary-General on giving priority to preventive\r\ndiplomacy, and we hope that this will be further\r\nstrengthened as an effective instrument of collective\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe are very interested in the report entitled “An\r\nAgenda for Development” which the Secretary-General\r\npresented to the General Assembly on 4 May 1994. This\r\nreport has given rise to a stimulating and lively debate.\r\nDuring the Economic and Social Council’s discussions on\r\nthe subject, Governments indicated their desire to enhance\r\nthe effectiveness of the development activities of the\r\nUnited Nations and to strengthen practical cooperation in\r\nthese activities. We believe that greater consistency must\r\nbe achieved in the criteria governing development\r\nactivities. This task cannot be postponed. All Member\r\nStates must categorically promote the adoption of an\r\naction-oriented agenda that defines strategies, parameters\r\nand the means of achieving reform of the current\r\ninternational economic system and of fulfilling many of\r\nthe aspirations of the developing world.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nWe are particularly concerned over the fact that the\r\nquestion of foreign debt — a principal source of instability\r\nin the developing world — is not reflected adequately in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report. Nicaragua, as a country with\r\na high indebtedness, attributes great importance to this\r\nsubject. We believe that the United Nations should play a\r\ngreater role in the search for viable solutions to the whole\r\nproblem. An agenda for development, to be feasible, must\r\ntake into account the impact of external debt on the\r\neconomies of the developing countries, especially the least\r\ndeveloped of them.\r\nAs regards the restructuring of the United Nations\r\ndevelopment system, we are confident that the appointment\r\nof an Administrator of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme to help the Secretary-General improve the\r\ncoordination of operational activities for development —\r\nactivities such as strengthening the role of the resident\r\ncoordinator and improving the consistency of policies in the\r\nUnited Nations system — will yield good results.\r\nI should like now to refer to a matter of major\r\nimportance to my delegation. My country, Nicaragua, is a\r\nnew democracy. The country and its people have recent\r\nexperience of a terrible internal conflict that devastated the\r\nland for more than a decade. This experience has taught us\r\nto believe in coexistence and in the merits of democracy.\r\nIn this context, we are particularly concerned that the\r\nSecretary-General’s report — specifically the part dealing\r\nwith the “Agenda for Peace” — does not adequately\r\naddress all the initiatives the United Nations system has\r\ntaken and all the support it has given to many countries of\r\nthe international community with a view to consolidating\r\npeace and strengthening democracy and its institutions.\r\nThe strengthening of democracy is a vital component\r\nof preventive diplomacy and of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The United Nations must feel proud of the\r\nsuccess of its efforts to consolidate democracy in various\r\nparts of the world — among them, my country.\r\nWe consider that the Organization’s work in support\r\nof democracy and peace must be strengthened and that it\r\nmerits close attention. Here we should like to refer to the\r\nsupport of the United Nations for the holding of the Second\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored Democracies,\r\nwhich took place in Managua, Nicaragua, last July and was\r\nattended by 77 countries as participants or observers. This\r\nwould not have been possible without the support of the\r\nUnited Nations system. In the Plan of Action that the\r\nConference adopted it was agreed that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral should be asked to prepare a study on how the\r\nUnited Nations system could promote the consolidation of\r\nnew or restored democracies. In the coming days we shall\r\nbe submitting a draft resolution on this subject.\r\nIn conclusion, we should like to commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his broad vision — the product of\r\nhis great experience as a diplomat and statesman. We\r\nagree with the comment in his report that this difficult\r\nperiod for mankind provides us with a great opportunity\r\nto bring together, in a coherent and unified fashion, the\r\noriginal aims of the world Organization. This\r\ncomprehensive vision would enable the United Nations to\r\nenhance its operational effectiveness in dealing with the\r\nmultidimensional questions related to an integrated\r\napproach and renewed multilateral action.\r\nAs it completes 50 years, the United Nations must\r\nrecognize that, in large part, the attitudes and experiences\r\nof the past are no longer relevant. The new political\r\nsituation and the economic challenges that we face on the\r\nthreshold of the twenty-first century require major\r\ndecisions on the part of the international community as a\r\nwhole. The time has come to cast off the shackles of the\r\npast and to face together the challenges of world-wide\r\nand economic social reconstruction.\r\nMr. Mwaungulu (Malawi), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMr. Yoo (Republic of Korea): The delegation of the\r\nRepublic of Korea welcomes the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization. At the outset, I\r\nwould like to express my deep appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff for producing an important\r\nand useful document. Today, the United Nations is deeply\r\ninvolved in a wide range of issues which have a far-\r\nreaching impact on our lives and the environment. It is\r\nfor this reason that my delegation values the\r\ncomprehensive yet concise overview of the whole range\r\nof activities of the world body over the past 12 months.\r\nRather than trying to touch upon the multiplicity of\r\nissues, activities and actors covered in the report, I will\r\nmake general observations on such key areas as\r\ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance, peace-keeping\r\noperations and the financial situation of the Organization.\r\nDespite the considerable achievements in\r\ndevelopment during the last 50 years, developing\r\ncountries are continuously confronted with daunting\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nchallenges, such as poverty, disease, unemployment\r\ninadequate education and environmental degradation.\r\nIf the international community is to surmount these\r\nchallenges, it must continue to focus on development as a\r\ntop priority of the global agenda. As development is one of\r\nthe most effective means of preventive diplomacy,\r\ndevelopment and peace naturally go hand in hand.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to see that the United\r\nNations has progressively attached more importance to the\r\nissue of development. The Secretary-General’s report\r\nentitled “An Agenda for Development” is a most timely and\r\nimportant document. We feel that in order to serve as a\r\nstrong complement to “An Agenda for Peace” the report\r\ncould be enhanced with further feasible and action-oriented\r\nrecommendations.\r\nAlthough individual countries must bear the primary\r\nresponsibility for development, national efforts must be\r\nbuttressed by international cooperation. The United Nations\r\nis the most appropriate and capable forum to deal with this\r\nvital issue, particularly in formulating a comprehensive\r\napproach for development through its capacity to\r\naccumulate experience, expertise and human resources in\r\nthis field. At the same time, the reform and restructuring of\r\nthe United Nations should be continued and further\r\nstrengthened to meet new and complex responsibilities. In\r\nthis regard, coordination among development-related\r\nagencies is essential. My delegation welcomes the\r\nSecretary-General’s decision to assign new responsibility to\r\nthe Administrator of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme to assist him in enhancing policy coherence\r\nwith the United Nations and overall coordination of\r\noperational activities for development. Given the broad-\r\nbased and comprehensive concept of development, the\r\nUnited Nations must reinforce its role in this area by\r\nadopting a new approach which will effectively respond to\r\nthe challenging needs of developing countries.\r\nDuring the past 12 months, the international\r\ncommunity has witnessed a number of massive\r\nhumanitarian crises world wide. Particularly shocking is the\r\ngenocide committed in flagrant violation of the principles\r\nand purposes of the United Nations Charter. Faced with\r\nunprecedented humanitarian disasters caused by armed\r\nethnic and civil conflicts and natural disasters, the relevant\r\norgans of the United Nations, particularly the Department\r\nof Humanitarian Assistance, have played an instrumental\r\nrole in arranging and coordinating humanitarian assistance\r\nto victims. However, the report alerts us to the disturbing\r\nfact that over 30 million people in 29 countries are still\r\nplagued by humanitarian emergencies. Given the\r\nmagnitude of the situation, strengthened coordination\r\namong the various actors in the humanitarian field, as\r\nwell as among the humanitarian, political and peace-\r\nkeeping activities of the United Nations, should be\r\nstrongly encouraged. My delegation urges the\r\ninternational community to reinforce its assistance to the\r\naffected populations, while the United Nations, through\r\nthe Department of Humanitarian Affairs and the\r\nInter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), continues to\r\nendeavour to enhance its ability to respond quickly and in\r\na coherent manner.\r\nWith humanitarian relief operations frequently being\r\ncarried out in the midst of violent conflict, another major\r\nchallenge lies in securing adequate protection for\r\nhumanitarian personnel. In this regard, principles and\r\noperational guidelines for relief programmes in conditions\r\nof conflict, which are being worked out under the\r\nauspices of the IASC, should be elaborated as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\nPeace-keeping operations are also being conducted\r\nin more challenging settings. As operations have increased\r\nnot only in peril but also in cost, it has become difficult\r\nto find sufficient troops and support personnel to cope\r\nwith the most arduous tasks, while emergency conflict\r\nsituations demand rapid deployment of military and\r\ncivilian personnel. Moreover, the persistent United\r\nNations financial crisis, due to the failure of Member\r\nStates to pay their assessments on time, has delayed\r\ntroop-contributor reimbursement.\r\nIn light of the difficult conditions surrounding peace-\r\nkeeping operations these days, more efforts should be\r\nmade to effectively employ preventive diplomacy. If\r\nprevention has failed, the decision of the United Nations\r\nto get involved in actual conflicts should be made with\r\ndiscretion and prioritization. Greater focus should be\r\ngiven to address the modality of intervention and the\r\nmeans of securing necessary resources.\r\nFinally, my delegation believes that ensuring an\r\nadequate financial base is a central prerequisite for any\r\nUnited Nations activity. The report shows that, as in\r\nprevious years, the financial situation of the Organization\r\nhas not seen any improvement over the past year. The\r\nfact that the chronic state of financial crisis has always\r\nbeen at the core of debates at the United Nations reflects\r\nthe complexity of this problem. My delegation agrees\r\nwith the Secretary-General’s observation that the\r\nunpredictability and irregularity of contributions from\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nMember States make it extremely difficult to manage the\r\nOrganization effectively.\r\nAs one of the Member States which appreciates the\r\nnecessity of consistent and faithful payment of assessed\r\ncontributions, the Republic of Korea shares the concern\r\nexpressed by the Secretary-General to the General\r\nAssembly regarding the gravity of the financial situation of\r\nthe United Nations. My Government will carefully study\r\nthe ideas of the Secretary-General for extricating the\r\nOrganization from its financial predicament and make\r\nfurther comments on them at the appropriate time.\r\nMr. Yassin (Sudan): The Secretary-General’s report\r\non the work of the Organization, contained in document\r\nA/49/1 of 2 September 1994, is a valued and painstaking\r\nhuman endeavour to make this world a better place to live\r\nin. One can say with confidence that the report reflects the\r\nSecretary-General’s eagerness to translate the hopes and\r\naspirations of the international community, to move beyond\r\nthe mistakes and hesitation of the past, even the near past,\r\nand set the ongoing human march in the right direction,\r\ntowards realizing the respect and dignity of every individual\r\nhuman being. As the task is no doubt difficult and\r\ncumbersome, the report ascends into heights of considerable\r\nachievements, then descends towards unaccomplished\r\nendeavours and finally lands on thorny grounds of bitter\r\nfailures due to lack of either necessary funds and reporting\r\nor the necessary political will of some Member States.\r\nIt is thus a true reflection of our diverse tendencies. It\r\nis therefore evident that the Secretary-General in person,\r\nand the Organization in general, require a true environment\r\nof cooperation and goodwill, with an absence of self-\r\ncentred attitudes on the part of those who must be guided\r\nby impartiality.\r\nThe report dwells on a multitude of United Nations\r\nactivities which are hard to cover in this limited statement.\r\nBut on the whole we can safely say that its main thrust is\r\nthe broader concept of the human aspect, a natural by-\r\nproduct of the preoccupations of the Secretary-General\r\nhimself, already truly reflected in his “Agenda for Peace”\r\nand also in his intended “Agenda for Development”. We\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his efforts. Success or\r\nfailure, good or poor delivery, is attributable to the\r\nperformance of those who are directly responsible for\r\nparticipating, evaluating and even adjudicating without\r\nmalice or bad faith.\r\nWe cannot but agree with the report that peace and\r\nsecurity are organically linked to development. But, as the\r\nreport truly reflects, what we have so far witnessed in\r\ndevelopmental activities and collective thinking is not\r\nenough. The attainment of genuine peace and security\r\nessentially means uprooting the lingering causes of\r\nconflicts. Long-term development in its wider meaning is\r\nthe answer and the remedy. But, just as we concur with\r\nthe report that peace, a good economy, the environment,\r\nand societies and good governance intermarry to produce\r\ndevelopment, and just as we equally concur that peace,\r\njustice, human rights and development are necessary\r\nprerequisites for the advancement and welfare of nations,\r\nit is equally important to ascertain their universality in\r\napplication and practice. Certain States cannot simply\r\nimpose their own interpretations and applications of these\r\nlofty concepts on others indiscriminately. Different\r\nnations adopt different applications, which are also sound\r\nand just. The commitment remains the same however.\r\nIt is against this background that we view the efforts\r\nof the Organization to realize and cement peace and\r\nsecurity world wide. The strategic preoccupations of big\r\nnations, whether military, economic or political, should\r\nnot devour the interests or aspirations of smaller nations.\r\nDemocratic norms can never be applied ready-made. Each\r\nnation has the right to apply the form of democracy most\r\nsuitable to satisfying the political, social and religious\r\ninclinations of its own citizens. The objective is the real\r\ncontribution of citizens in self-rule, good governance and\r\nfull accountability to the people.\r\nAllow me to go into somewhat greater detail.\r\nSudan fully supports the continuing process of\r\nstreamlining the structures and work of all United Nations\r\nbodies. But what we aspire to is perfection with the least\r\nexpense, achievements without overlooking important\r\nareas or issues.\r\nThe role of the General Assembly in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security should be\r\nstrengthened in order to achieve equity with the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nAs for the enlargement of the Security Council and\r\nhow it should function, we support the input of the\r\nnon-aligned countries in this respect. In broad terms, we\r\nbelieve that membership of the Security Council,\r\npermanent or non-permanent, is a responsibility by proxy\r\nand not a privilege and that the Council represents a\r\nsensitive scale that must be balanced and not unbalanced,\r\na platform on which to spell out the real attitudes and\r\nconvictions of the whole international community and not\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\na sanctuary for those who want to govern the world. In this\r\ncontext we feel that it is of special importance that the\r\ngroup entrusted with the task of looking to improve the\r\nwork of the Council should broaden its contacts to include\r\nregional organizations, whose role in maintaining regional\r\npeace and security is still marginalized. We are particularly\r\nworried that the Council is increasingly tilting towards\r\ninconsistency and clandestine methods of work.\r\nThere must, we believe, be strict guiding principles for\r\npeace-keeping operations. The non-aligned have offered a\r\nhandsome contribution in this respect.\r\nAs for regional conflicts, we continue to emphasize\r\nthe fact that sustained economic growth and equitable\r\nfunctioning of the world economy are the most appropriate\r\napproaches. This can clearly be seen in the case of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe experience involved in the creation of the Office\r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights is an evolving\r\none. The report gives considerable space to this. But, as this\r\nexperience is still under way, we continue to support the\r\nideas presented by the non-aligned with a view to\r\nconsolidating the High Commissioner’s mandate. But on the\r\nwhole we do not concur with the continuing inclination to\r\nuse the pretext of the protection of human rights as a\r\npolitical excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of\r\nsovereign States. Respect for human rights should be\r\nuniversal; and human rights should be strictly observed by\r\nall States.\r\nIn the Secretary-General’s report the situation in the\r\nSudan is described as follows:\r\n“The Sudan remains one of the most enduring\r\nand serious humanitarian crises in the world.” (A/49/1,\r\npara. 355)\r\nWe consider this statement to be highly generalized, not\r\nreally factual, rather inflammatory and motivated by the\r\nidea of exerting pressure on Sudan. The Arabic translation\r\ngives the statement a more strident tone and shows a\r\nsubjective approach. The figures quoted concerning the\r\nnumber who have died because of the hostilities or the\r\nnumber who were displaced are far from true. The total is\r\nstated to be 6 million. The truth is that the entire population\r\nof the southern Sudan in time of peace does not reach that\r\nfigure. The truth also is that about 3 million inhabitants of\r\nthe south have moved northwards seeking protection from\r\nthe inhuman treatment and banditry of all the rebel factions.\r\nWe would have preferred truthfulness, accuracy and\r\nprofessionalism in this type of description.\r\nThe report also speaks of cases of the Government’s\r\nnon-cooperation with some non-governmental\r\norganizations which has allegedly contributed to\r\nobstructing the delivery of emergency aid to those in\r\nneed. The truth is that the Government has established a\r\nlarge commission to facilitate the work of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in Sudan. It has successfully\r\nconcluded an agreement encompassing every non-\r\ngovernmental organization operating in the country. It\r\nalso consented to their request to choose five of their\r\nnumber as coordinators with governmental authorities. I\r\nshould like to confirm from this rostrum that the large\r\nmajority of these organizations are operating in all\r\ntranquillity with all the Sudanese authorities concerned.\r\nSome, however, tend to exceed their mandate and meddle\r\nin the internal affairs of the country. Sudan is not the\r\nonly example; similar examples can be cited from various\r\nparts of the world. The sense of mission should not\r\noverlap the humanitarian outlook of these organizations.\r\nPublic opinion in their own constituencies at home should\r\nnot blind them to the truth as they see it in reality, on the\r\nground. In this respect, Sudan accepts the testimony of\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and\r\nother non-governmental organizations.\r\nI find it my duty to inform this body, as my Minister\r\ndid earlier, that the Government of Sudan has made\r\nextensive strides in its untiring search for a peaceful\r\nsettlement of this conflict, inflamed by external\r\ninterference. Our efforts, however, will continue to be in\r\nvain if we are not left alone to settle our differences. As\r\nthe Sudan Government has, in good faith, signed three\r\nSudan Lifeline operations agreements, it is time for the\r\nworld to condemn the rebel movements that are\r\nobstructing, looting and confiscating food and medicine\r\naid. The United Nations authorities have adequately\r\nproved this. My delegation will take up this matter again\r\nat a later stage, during the consideration of this item in\r\nthe appropriate Committee.\r\nMr. Henze (Germany): First of all I should like to\r\njoin others in thanking the Secretary-General and his staff\r\nfor the comprehensive report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/49/1). It demonstrates once again the\r\nincreasing demands made on the United Nations and the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nWhereas during the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly much attention was devoted to the development\r\nand improvement of peace-keeping activities based on “An\r\nAgenda for Peace” (A/47/27), this year we must once again\r\nfocus our work on the problems of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. We welcome the intention of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to correct the misperception that the United Nations\r\nis primarily devoted to peace-keeping. Important as this\r\nfield of activities is, the United Nations will succeed in its\r\npurpose “to maintain international peace and security” only\r\nif it deals with the roots of instability. We share the view\r\nof the Secretary-General that many conflicts have economic\r\nand social origins. The prevention of conflicts must\r\ntherefore start at their roots. In this context the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment must be the centrepiece of our work.\r\nIn his report “An Agenda for Development”\r\n(A/48/935), the Secretary-General has provided us with an\r\nin-depth analysis of the foundations of international\r\ncooperation for development. The fundamental changes in\r\nthe political situation and in economic policy world wide\r\nhave created a new environment in which we have a real\r\nchance of “bringing to fulfilment a renewed vision of\r\ndevelopment”. The Agenda for Development must\r\ncomplement the Agenda for Peace as there is a clear\r\ninterrelationship between peace and development.\r\nWithout peace there can be no development, and\r\nwithout development we will face increasing insecurity and\r\nconflicts in many parts of the world. A new framework for\r\naddressing new dimensions of development, including the\r\nrole the United Nations could play is indeed strongly\r\nneeded.\r\nThese past years have made us understand that\r\ndevelopment is of a very complex nature and that it is not\r\nenough to promote simple economic growth. That is why\r\nmy Government strongly supports the concept of the five\r\ndimensions of development identified and defined in the\r\nReport of the Secretary-General. They should be seen as\r\npart of an integrated concept of sustainable human\r\ndevelopment. The addendum to be prepared by the\r\nSecretary-General should be built upon these five\r\ndimensions in order to reach a number of operational\r\nconclusions.\r\nWe share the view expressed in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report “An Agenda for Development” that there\r\nis a clear linkage between political stability and\r\ndevelopment. Democracy, development and respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent\r\nand mutually reinforcing. They are the primary\r\nresponsibility of Governments, which have to ensure the\r\nframework conditions for development.\r\nThe process of rendering the Agenda operational\r\nmust be based on a spirit of partnership founded on\r\nrecognition of mutual interest and solidarity. There is a\r\nneed to recognize the increasing diversity of the\r\ndeveloping world and the growing differentiation among\r\ndeveloping countries. Several developing countries are\r\nnow key actors in the world economy and should play an\r\nincreased role in development cooperation efforts. There\r\nis also a need to recognize the role of new actors in\r\ndevelopment, including non-governmental actors.\r\nThe fight against poverty is a centrepiece of\r\ndevelopment assistance. The addendum to the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment should pay particular attention to the least-\r\ndeveloped countries and Africa. Particular problems of\r\ncountries in transition should also be addressed.\r\nA number of conferences held this year and to be\r\nheld in 1995 are dealing with development-related\r\nproblems. In May we discussed the problems of small\r\nisland countries and agreed on a plan of action. The\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nin Cairo not only focused attention on the central issue —\r\npopulation — but it was also able to reach a broad\r\nagreement on integrating population issues and\r\ndevelopment. Next year the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in Copenhagen, which has been an\r\nimportant issue this week, will have to agree on a set of\r\ncommitments on the eradication of poverty, on\r\nemployment and on social integration. These are essential\r\nelements of national and international stability. The\r\nFourth World Conference on Women in Beijing will not\r\nonly recognize the important role of women in\r\ndevelopment but also, as we hope, agree on guidelines for\r\nfurther promoting this role.\r\nThe United Nations is the only forum where we can\r\nintegrate the results of these conferences into a\r\ncomprehensive concept for development. But in order to\r\ndo so the role of the United Nations in development has\r\nto be revitalized. Further reforms designed to increase its\r\nrelevance in this field are needed. We look forward to the\r\naddendum to the report of the Secretary-General on an\r\nAgenda for Development, which we hope will contain\r\nproposals to this effect.\r\nIn conclusion, my Government believes that\r\ndevelopment is a fundamental human right. Peace as the\r\nfoundation, the economy as the engine of progress, the\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nenvironment as a basis for sustainability, justice as a pillar\r\nof society, and democracy as good governance constitute\r\nthe safest foundation for its realization.\r\nMr. Abibi (Congo) (interpretation from French): The\r\nreport on the work of the Organization provided to us every\r\nyear by the Secretary-General gives us an opportunity to\r\nassess the progress made on the road travelled by the\r\ninternational community in its quest for more freedom,\r\nsecurity, peace and social progress for all people.\r\nFirst of all my delegation would like to pay a well-\r\ndeserved tribute to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and express our great\r\nappreciation for the high quality of the document before us.\r\nWe noted in particular that the report describes clearly\r\nall aspects of the activities of the Organization, ranging\r\nfrom our many achievements — some of which still have\r\nto be strengthened — to the innumerable challenges that\r\nstill lie before us, and some understandable shortcomings\r\nthat remain to be dealt with. The report presents to us the\r\nOrganization as it is today and as it functions today on the\r\neve of its fiftieth anniversary and thus helps us to better\r\nunderstand the actual limits of the United Nations system.\r\nIt also highlights the main axes round which we should\r\nfocus our thoughts so as to provide our Organization with\r\nthe conceptual resources and the operational resources that\r\nare necessary in order to take up the major challenges\r\nfacing the international community today.\r\nThe Organization can pride itself on a number of\r\nachievements during the period covered by the report. One\r\nof the first was the historic change in South Africa with the\r\neradication of apartheid, a major event in which this\r\nOrganization had invested enormous energies. Likewise,\r\npersevering and patient work in Mozambique allows us to\r\nglimpse, with the holding of free elections, the prospect of\r\na happy future for this brother country. In Angola, the\r\nforthcoming signing of the peace agreement, thanks to the\r\noutstanding work of the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General, will unquestionably do credit to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThese few achievements on our continent strengthen\r\nour belief that with a stronger political will on the part of\r\nMember States the United Nations will be able to solve the\r\nother absurd conflicts that still engulf certain African\r\ncountries, putting an end to the nightmare suffered by\r\ninnocent peoples who are forced to wandering through their\r\nown homelands. That is why my country cannot endorse\r\nany attempt to have the United Nations disengage from\r\ncertain hot points that are mainly in Africa. My country\r\nbelieves that we must constantly urge the various parties\r\nto these conflicts to show greater responsibility by\r\ncooperating with the United Nations to seek lasting\r\nsolutions to the problems undermining their countries.\r\nMy delegation believes that the peace-keeping\r\noperations maintained by the United Nations, if entered\r\ninto with care and with respect for the provisions of the\r\nCharter, contribute enormously to the safeguarding of\r\ninternational peace and security. We reaffirm here the\r\ncommitment of the Republic of the Congo to increasing\r\nits future contributions as a troop-contributing country.\r\nMy delegation also believes that within the context of\r\nthose peace-keeping operations, the United Nations, in the\r\nspirit of the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter,\r\nshould step up its cooperation with regional bodies, and\r\nin the particular case of Africa, that it assist the\r\nOrganization of African States (OAU) in making the\r\nlatter’s conflict prevention, management and settlement\r\nmechanisms more effective.\r\nThe United Nations is an instrument for peace; it\r\nmust also efficiently promote development. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the emerging consensus among the Member\r\nStates that, as the report emphasizes in several places,\r\n“In the altered context of today’s world, the\r\ndefinition of security is no longer limited to\r\nquestions of land and weapons. It now includes\r\neconomic well-being, environmental sustainability\r\nand the protection of human rights”. (A/49/1,\r\npara. 4).\r\nThis point was made on 27 September 1994 from\r\nthis very rostrum by the Congolese Foreign Minister,\r\nwhen he said,\r\n“peace and security in our States and throughout the\r\nworld require a solution to our people’s economic\r\nand social problems” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 7th meeting, p. 44).\r\nUnfortunately, as the report very rightly points out,\r\n“While we have seen some progress towards peace\r\nand conflict management, we have seen little\r\nconcerted action towards development”. (Ibid.)\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nThe case of Africa vividly illustrates these weaknesses in\r\nterms of international solidarity and the failure to live up to\r\ncommitments entered into.\r\nThis is a time of great hope for economic recovery in\r\nmany parts of our planet, suggesting that we will soon\r\nemerge from the turbulence imposed by the crisis that the\r\nworld has been facing and that has highlighted the vanity\r\nof ideological and doctrinaire clichés on economic matters;\r\nAfrica, however, stands tragically apart from this general\r\nmovement. Our marginalization at the levels of international\r\ntrade, monetary affairs, finances, technology,\r\ncommunication and exchanges of information is\r\nincreasingly apparent. To this we can add the reduction in\r\nofficial development assistance and the burden of foreign\r\ndebt, which remains one of the most serious hindrances to\r\nAfrican countries’ efforts to mobilize the necessary\r\nresources for development. The socio-economic situation of\r\nAfrica remains disturbing.\r\nUnfortunately, the report hardly reassures us, as it\r\nconfirms a negative trend: resources devoted to operational\r\nactivities of the United Nations for development continue,\r\ntragically, to drop. My delegation therefore appeals to donor\r\ncountries that they establish a more stable financing\r\nmechanism and work resolutely to implement the\r\ncommitments they have entered into. When all is said and\r\ndone, the problem here is that which is quite rightly noted\r\nin the report, and with which my delegation agrees\r\nwholeheartedly:\r\n“The United Nations must renew and strengthen its\r\ncommitment to work in the economic and social\r\nfields”. (Ibid., para. 4)\r\nAs the twentieth century draws to an close, with the\r\nend of the cold war and with the enormous potential\r\noffered by science and technology, mankind has the means\r\nto usher in a new era based on sustainable human\r\ndevelopment for everyone, everywhere. We agree with the\r\npoint emphasized by the report that\r\n“As a forum for discussion and awareness-raising, as\r\na tool for cooperation and decision-making, and as a\r\nvehicle for promoting multilateral action, the United\r\nNations can help forge the necessary global\r\nconsensus” (A/49/1, para. 9)\r\nfor the attainment of this goal. That is why the\r\nOrganization offers hope for the future to small countries\r\nsuch as my own that struggle with all their energy to\r\nescape the destiny of abject poverty and to take their\r\nrightful place in the international community.\r\nMr. Gambari (Nigeria): I consider it a great honour\r\nand a distinct privilege to address this Assembly on the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on the work of our\r\nOrganization. My delegation attaches great importance to\r\nthe work of the United Nations, which holds the greatest\r\nhope for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity and the enhancement of international cooperation\r\nfor desirable economic growth and social development in\r\na sound and sustainable environment.\r\nI would like to commend the efforts and the\r\ndemonstrated determination of our very able Secretary-\r\nGeneral to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our\r\nOrganization. I would also like to state that my delegation\r\nendorses the position of the non-aligned countries, as ably\r\npresented earlier by my colleague, the representative of\r\nIndonesia. I would like, however, to make a few specific\r\ncomments on some of the issues raised.\r\nThe profound and rapid changes on the international\r\nscene make it necessary for the members of this\r\nAssembly to renew their commitment to the objectives of\r\nthe United Nations as set up by the founding fathers.\r\nHappily, the cold war has ended, and there is a new\r\nopportunity to fulfil the principles and purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations as contained in the Charter of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nNevertheless, the post-cold-war world has,\r\nregrettably, witnessed numerous extremely serious\r\nconflicts, sometimes of an ethnic or tribal nature, in some\r\nregions of the world. The United Nations has been called\r\nupon to play leading roles to solve or manage such\r\nconflicts. Unfortunately, Member States have not always\r\nmatched the authorizations of peace-keeping operations\r\nand peacemaking efforts with the necessary resources.\r\nMany of these conflicts have also assumed such\r\ndimensions and complexities that they pose serious\r\nconsequences for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nHowever, it is the view of my delegation that the\r\nUnited Nations must continue to persevere in its efforts to\r\npromote lasting solutions to these conflicts, wherever they\r\nmay occur. Our Organization cannot simply pack up and\r\nexit from Somalia, for example, or from Liberia while\r\nstaying on in Bosnia, in Cyprus, in Lebanon and\r\nelsewhere. Peace is truly indivisible and the search for\r\npeace is the collective responsibility of all of us.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nMember States should demonstrate renewed political\r\nwill to support the efforts of the Secretary-General in the\r\nquest for peace and security, economic growth and social\r\ndevelopment, which are all necessary bases and foundations\r\nfor international and human solidarity, which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has called for in both the “Agenda for Peace” and\r\nthe complementary “Agenda for Development”. In our\r\nview, there can be no peace without sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy delegation endorses the Secretary-General’s call to\r\nMembers to consider making prompt payment of assessed\r\ncontributions for the operations of the Organization. The\r\nprompt payment of assessed contributions is to be regarded\r\nas a priority for all of us in order to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of our Organization and better to facilitate the\r\noperation of United Nations organs and several of its\r\nactivities. Good intentions and comprehensive programmes\r\nof action can be useful only when supported by the\r\nnecessary financial resources on the part of Member States.\r\nWhile there must be strict adherence to the principles of\r\nmutual respect for the equality and sovereignty of States,\r\nthe rights of all States effectively to participate in the\r\ndeliberations and decision-making mechanism of the United\r\nNations on issues of global and regional interest must be\r\nbalanced by Members’ fulfilling their financial\r\nresponsibilities and obligations to the Organization. The\r\nfinancial difficulty of the United Nations as reported\r\nrecently by the Secretary-General demands the urgent\r\nattention of all Members.\r\nMy delegation commented earlier on Security Council\r\nreforms and has already made suggestions on the review of\r\nthe Council’s composition and operation. We will continue\r\nto make constructive contributions to the ongoing debate\r\nand consultations on Security Council reform and related\r\nmatters. Specifically, democratization and transparency in\r\nits operation must remain the cornerstones of the process of\r\nreform, not only in the Security Council but in other forums\r\nof our Organization as well.\r\nThe United Nations, which has provided a forum for\r\ndialogue to defuse several hotbeds of tension in the world,\r\nremains a veritable catalyst in the efforts to maintain peace\r\nand security through the enforcement of fundamental\r\nhuman rights. The Charter of the United Nations, which\r\nembodies the principles that are basic to the attainment of\r\ninternational peace and security, needs the support of all\r\nMembers at the turn of the century and beyond. It is\r\ntherefore my delegation’s belief that each and every one of\r\nus has a stake in a shared responsibility to strengthen our\r\nOrganization. This is necessary in order to make it more\r\nable and capable of achieving the objectives of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security in a\r\npolitically stable and economically sound atmosphere.\r\nMy delegation will support intensified efforts to\r\nstrengthen coordination and collaboration among the\r\nmajor organs of the United Nations. In particular, we\r\nsupport greater consultation between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council on all major issues of\r\ncommon concern. My delegation supports the suggestion\r\nthat the Economic and Social Council should be made to\r\nplay a more active role in the renewed efforts to support\r\neconomic and social development as envisaged in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report.\r\nThe ongoing exercise within the United Nations\r\nsystem to improve internal coordination and cooperation\r\naimed at eliminating waste and at strengthening the\r\neffective utilization of available resources in the\r\nimplementation of programmes and approved projects\r\nshould be encouraged and supported. In this regard, we\r\ncommend the efforts of the Secretary-General and his\r\ncollaborators, and we urge them to intensify those efforts.\r\nFinally, it is my delegation’s view that the United\r\nNations can be better strengthened through our renewed\r\ncommitment and actions in support of the objectives of\r\nour Organization as enunciated in its Charter and of the\r\nidea of shared global responsibility and new partnership\r\nin development. We believe that, with the requisite\r\npolitical will and renewed commitment to the idea of\r\nhuman solidarity, international peace and security,\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development in a sound\r\nenvironment can be achieved under a reinvigorated United\r\nNations, while our efforts and priority should continue to\r\nbe focused on peacemaking, preventive diplomacy,\r\nappropriate mechanisms for conflict resolution, and peace-\r\nbuilding.\r\nMr. Zawels (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Argentine delegation is delighted that the\r\nGeneral Assembly is again discussing a report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization. For a\r\nnumber of years now, the Secretary-General’s reports\r\nhave helped us to reflect on the tasks facing the\r\nOrganization. In this context, we wish to highlight the\r\ndocument submitted to us this year by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We appreciate not only the format, which\r\nincludes tables and graphs based on statistics, but also the\r\nreport’s comprehensive approach, which emphasizes that\r\nthere is an interrelationship between the question of\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\neconomic and social development and the question of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAny organization, to fulfil the tasks assigned to it,\r\nmust have sufficient and necessary resources. In recent\r\nyears the United Nations has suffered a chronic shortfall in\r\nthe flow of financial resources. This has given rise to a\r\npersistent crisis, described by the Secretary-General as\r\nunprecedented. It is clear that the main cause of this crisis\r\nis the fact that Member States do not pay their dues in full\r\nor punctually. In the view of the Argentine Republic, this\r\ncrisis should be thoroughly analysed. Only by considering\r\nall the elements of the crisis will it be possible to find\r\nappropriate solutions to every aspect of the problem. We\r\nbelieve that this is a matter of priority, because if a solution\r\nis not found to this problem the United Nations runs the\r\nrisk of seeing its various tasks seriously compromised, in\r\nthe field both of economic and social development and of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe United Nations Charter assigns a central role to\r\nthe United Nations in the field of economic development.\r\nFor the Argentine Republic, the mandate of the United\r\nNations in this sphere encompasses two directly interrelated\r\nareas. On the one hand, the United Nations is an\r\nexceptional forum for debate and for increasing the\r\ninternational community’s awareness of international\r\neconomic problems. In this respect, the agreements reached\r\n- for example at the special session of the Group of 18, the\r\nRio Summit and the Cairo Conference - undoubtedly\r\nconstitute milestones in defining the general political\r\nguidelines that should govern international economic\r\nactivities.\r\nUnfortunately, real-world indicators tell us that each\r\ntime we meet we find ourselves farther removed from the\r\nworld that we envisage here in these halls. We believe that\r\nmost of the international economic problems could be\r\nresolved if each country present here were to put into\r\npractice the commitments undertaken.\r\nThe debate on a programme for development\r\nconstitutes once again an opportunity to put into practice,\r\nfrom an overall, realistic and pragmatic standpoint, the\r\nguidelines agreed on in the documents mentioned earlier.\r\nSecondly, the United Nations, and in the particular the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, have a central\r\nrole to play in cooperation for development, promoting,\r\nthrough the operational activities of the system, concrete\r\nprogrammes of economic cooperation for development,\r\nwhich are a crucial element for the developing world as\r\na whole.\r\nArgentina views with great concern the reduction in\r\ncontributions suffered by the system at large. We hope\r\nthat the negotiations which are to take place in the\r\nframework of restructuring the economic and social\r\nsystem of the United Nations will make it easier in future\r\nto be able to rely on adequate and foreseeable resources,\r\nso that the United Nations can efficiently and effectively\r\nfulfil its mandate in this field.\r\nIn the social sphere, the Republic of Argentina\r\nattaches particular importance to the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms,\r\nbecause we are firmly convinced that it is virtually\r\nimpossible to live together in international peace until the\r\nlast vestige of oppression of the world’s peoples is\r\neliminated. At the present time, it is hard to identify any\r\ninternational crisis that does not contain some element of\r\nhuman-rights violation.\r\nIn this context, we reaffirm our commitment to the\r\nstrengthening of the machinery of the United Nations in\r\nthe field of human rights and in particular to the Office of\r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nThe Republic of Argentina attaches great importance,\r\nespecially in the framework of the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthis Organization, to the holding of high-level meetings\r\naimed at reviewing economic and social development\r\nissues. In this context, we want to underscore the\r\nimportance of upcoming meetings such as the World\r\nSummit on Social Development for Social Development\r\nand the Fourth World Conference on Women. In this\r\nconnection, it will be remembered that my country had\r\nthe pleasure recently of organizing the sixth regional\r\nconference on the integration of women in economic and\r\nsocial development, held in the city of Mar del Plata,\r\nwhich was a preparatory meeting, in the framework of\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, for the Beijing\r\nConference.\r\nWe have already referred to the close link between\r\npeace and development. In this context, the Republic of\r\nArgentina sees enormous potential in all of the United\r\nNations operational activities for development. None the\r\nless, there is room for improvement in one particular area\r\nof the system’s work: the link between the emergency\r\nstage and that of rehabilitation for development.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nIn this respect, the delegation of Argentina will be\r\nproposing to the Assembly, for its consideration at this\r\nsession and in the context of agenda item 37, on emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance, implementation of an initiative by\r\nthe President of the Republic of Argentina, Mr. Carlos\r\nMenem: which he called the \"White Helmets\".\r\nThe terms of reference of the proposal are the\r\nfollowing.\r\nFirst, with respect to the mandate, countries would\r\nestablish national volunteer corps with a high level of\r\nprofessionalism in the field of technical assistance for\r\nemergency situations followed by rehabilitation for\r\ndevelopment. These volunteer corps will be made available\r\nto the Secretary-General for participation in emergency\r\noperations.\r\nSecondly, as to institutional aspects, existing\r\nmultilateral mechanisms must be fully utilized. The United\r\nNations has, in the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, an\r\nexcellent mechanism for coordination, and in the United\r\nNations volunteers a perfect operational instrument. The\r\nproposal would make optimal use of them.\r\nThirdly, with respect to the financial aspects, every\r\ncountry is responsible for financing, for which, in all\r\ncountries, the participation of the private sector would be\r\nencouraged.\r\nWe hope, through this practical and viable proposal,\r\nwhich maximizes the potential of the volunteer work force,\r\nto contribute to the work of the United Nations in\r\nrehabilitation for development, which affects more and\r\nmore countries in the wake of natural or man-made\r\ndisasters.\r\nLastly, we wish to refer only briefly, because we will\r\nelaborate on this subject in the debate on the report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly, to the role of\r\nthe United Nations in the sphere of international peace and\r\nsecurity. The United Nations Secretariat has an exceptional\r\nrole to play in the implementation of the system of\r\ncollective security. It accomplishes this through the\r\nmanagement and organization of peace-keeping operations,\r\ngood-offices missions or fact-finding missions.\r\nThe Republic of Argentina wishes to underscore the\r\nwork accomplished in this field by the United Nations\r\nSecretariat, in particular in meeting the growing demand for\r\npersonnel and equipment for the various peace-keeping\r\noperations that are under way and also in restructuring its\r\nown internal organization.\r\nWith Argentina’s active participation in peace-\r\nkeeping, we can value the work of the Secretariat\r\nespecially. Argentina is contributing to this effort, not\r\nonly with troops and specialized units, but also through\r\nmilitary personnel seconded to the Secretariat and\r\nconcrete proposals to organize some of the current\r\nsystems, such as air transport. In this context, Argentina\r\nalso supports the system of reserve forces, which it\r\nbelieves will be highly useful in the future.\r\nNor should we fail to mention the subject of the\r\nsafety of peace-keeping operations personnel. Argentina\r\npays tribute to the men and women who have given their\r\nlives in the fulfilment of the tasks assigned them by the\r\nUnited Nations. In this context, we appeal to States to\r\ncooperate with a view to the adoption by the Assembly of\r\nthe draft convention on the safety and security of\r\npersonnel, prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee of the\r\nSixth Committee.\r\nMr. Pierre (Guyana): The rapidly evolving\r\ncircumstances of the current international context continue\r\nto present a host of challenges, as well as new\r\nopportunities, for the United Nations. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report shows, over the past year the\r\nOrganization has actively sought to address the manifold\r\ncritical global events and issues requiring urgent action\r\nand international collaboration. While the responsiveness\r\nof the Organization is evidently now less handicapped by\r\nobstacles previously produced by ideological rivalries of\r\nthe cold war, it has been limited by various constraints.\r\nHowever, despite this fact, the United Nations has\r\nundoubtedly made concerted efforts to deal with the\r\npressing demands it now faces.\r\nAn encouraging feature of this year’s report is the\r\nemphasis placed upon the multidimensional nature of\r\ninternational peace and security, which is now correctly\r\nperceived as encompassing economic well-being,\r\nenvironmental sustainability, democracy and the\r\nprotection of human rights. It is gratifying to note that\r\neconomic and social issues are increasingly gaining\r\nprominence on the international agenda and within the\r\nframework of the United Nations, where it is accepted\r\nthat there is an inextricable interlinkage and a symbiotic\r\nrelationship between international peace and security and\r\ndevelopment. The Secretary-General has affirmed in his\r\nreport that\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\n“the United Nations is deepening its attention to the\r\nfoundations of peace, which lie in the realm of\r\ndevelopment.” (A/49/1, para. 1)\r\nIt is widely acknowledged within the membership of\r\nthe United Nations that the current structure, which was\r\noriginally conceived almost half a century ago to address\r\nthe traditional narrow concepts of international peace and\r\nsecurity, is not in consonance with the prevailing global\r\nrealities now compelling the Organization to address a\r\nmyriad of unprecedented and complex issues and events.\r\nOver the past year considerable progress has been\r\nmade in deliberations and decisions regarding reform and\r\nrestructuring of the Organization to enhance its efficiency\r\nand effectiveness.\r\nWith respect to the Security Council, the extensive and\r\nvery constructive deliberations on the structure and\r\nfunctioning of that body were encouraging and positive, and\r\nthey augur well for the future. It is hoped that concrete and\r\ntimely results will emerge from the general agreement that\r\nthe Council should be enlarged and made more democratic,\r\ntransparent and representative of the current United Nations\r\nmembership. Indeed, some positive measures were\r\nimplemented to make its functioning transparent, and the\r\nGeneral Assembly is apparently playing a more active role\r\nin addressing the functioning of the Council.\r\nIn response to the growing concerns of the\r\ninternational community on the issue of human rights, the\r\nUnited Nations has sought to enhance its effectiveness in\r\naddressing this issue by creating the post of High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. It is expected that this\r\ndecision will result in the active promotion by the United\r\nNations of the enjoyment of civil, cultural, economic,\r\npolitical and social rights, which form the basis of human-\r\ncentred development.\r\nThe Agenda for Development, which was initiated as\r\na response, and, indeed, a necessary complement, to the\r\nAgenda for Peace, launched in 1992, has been the subject\r\nof intensive consultations over the past year. The World\r\nHearings on Development have elicited positive reactions\r\nfrom the international community and will certainly serve\r\nto advance the many concerns and proposals that will\r\neventually be integrated into the Agenda for Development.\r\nIt is hoped that the Agenda for Development will provide\r\nthe fundamental principles and guidelines for the\r\ninternational community to adopt an integrated and dynamic\r\napproach to the promotion of development that focuses on\r\nenduring human progress as its ultimate objective.\r\nDuring discussions on this subject it was constantly\r\nstressed that the United Nations needed to improve its\r\nown internal structures and operations to effectively\r\npromote the new concept of sustainable development,\r\nwhich encompasses various interrelated issues —\r\nsomething that could result in duplication and an\r\nunnecessary waste of scarce resources. It was widely felt\r\nthat more coherent and coordinated policies and\r\napproaches were required to streamline the Organization’s\r\nwork in this vital area. The decision of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to mandate the Administrator of the United\r\nNations Development Programme with responsibility to\r\nenhance the coordination of operational activities for\r\ndevelopment was a direct response to such appeals.\r\nIt is indeed commendable that, despite pressing\r\nfinancial constraints and a severe shortfall in resources for\r\ndevelopment, the United Nations is demonstrating the will\r\nto expand and enhance its activities in the area of\r\neconomic and social development as a manifest\r\nacknowledgment that development is a sine qua non for\r\nlasting international peace and security. The convening of\r\na number of international conferences on relevant\r\ndevelopment issues during the past year further attests to\r\nthis international commitment. It is sincerely hoped that\r\nthe findings and conclusions of these conferences will\r\nbenefit from a continued global commitment and thereby\r\nproduce positive long-term results.\r\nWhile the United Nations continued actively to\r\npursue its humanitarian and peace-keeping activities\r\noccasioned by the eruption of numerous internal conflicts\r\nand emergency situations of a global dimension, it\r\nnevertheless made stringent efforts to maintain its role in\r\npreventive diplomacy and peacemaking. The numerous\r\npeace-keeping operations and relief activities carried out\r\nin the last year continue to strain the Organization’s\r\nlimited resources. However, these are a vital responsibility\r\nof the international community that cannot and must not\r\nbe neglected.\r\nPreventive diplomacy and peace-keeping should be\r\na priority of the United Nations since such measures\r\nwould serve to prevent human suffering and an\r\nunnecessary and undesirable depletion of all resources.\r\nThe successful outcome of preventive diplomacy and\r\npeacemaking, which have political, economic and social\r\ncomponents, should obviate the outbreak of conflicts and\r\nthe concomitant necessity for costly peace-keeping\r\nexercises.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nOn a more positive note, the world was happy to\r\nwitness the progress achieved in the Middle East peace\r\nprocess and the acceptance by the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations of the credentials of Israel. The entry of a\r\ndemocratic and non-racial South Africa into the United\r\nNations was another highlight of the year. It is sincerely\r\nhoped that this spirit of cooperation and conciliation and the\r\npromotion of democracy globally will continue to gather\r\nimpetus and serve to enhance the functioning of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWith the impending fiftieth anniversary of this body,\r\nall Member States should strive to make a renewed\r\ncommitment to assist in the rebirth of an Organization that\r\nsets the well-being of all peoples as its ultimate objective.\r\nIn view of the rapid globalization process and the\r\nincreasing interdependence between nations, we should\r\nwork assiduously towards enhancing international\r\ncooperation and towards adopting an integrated and\r\ndynamic approach to address the root causes of conflict in\r\norder to achieve lasting peace and security. The\r\ninternational community increasingly looks to the United\r\nNations to resolve global problems. However, this cannot\r\nbe effectively achieved unless there is a serious\r\ncommitment by all Member States. Let us not allow\r\nourselves to become complacent, but, instead, strive\r\nrelentlessly towards achieving greater progress.\r\nThe President: It is customary for the Assembly to\r\ntake note of the annual report of the Secretary-General. If\r\nI hear no objection, may I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto take note of the report?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right\r\nof reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second, and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Sreenivasan (India): The delegation of Pakistan\r\nhas ceased to surprise. Its focus on India has become\r\nsomewhat tiresome, its arguments too evidently motivated.\r\nThe portion of the statement of the representative of\r\nPakistan relating to India was anchored in paragraphs 541\r\nand 542 of the Secretary-General’s report in document\r\nA/49/1. It is still not clear to my delegation how the\r\nSecretary-General has drawn the conclusion:\r\n“None the less, the level of tension in Jammu and\r\nKashmir has increased considerably in recent years.”\r\n(A/49/1, para. 541)\r\nMembers of the Assembly will recall that this rather\r\nsweeping assertion, covering a longish period of time,\r\nwas totally absent from the Secretary-General’s report to\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nMy Government’s response to that rather puzzling\r\nconclusion in the Secretary-General’s report was\r\nconveyed in a statement issued by the official spokesman\r\nof the Government of India on 24 September 1994. He\r\nsaid:\r\n“We note the Secretary-General’s reference to\r\nincrease in tension in Jammu and Kashmir. As we\r\nhave repeatedly said, and this has been\r\nacknowledged by impartial observers, this is entirely\r\ndue to Pakistan’s sponsorship of terrorism, militancy\r\nand extremism across the line of control.”\r\nThe spokesman went on to say:\r\n“The Government of India expects that the\r\nGovernment of Pakistan will demonstrate sincerity\r\nto find a peaceful solution by eschewing sponsorship\r\nof terrorism across the line of control, and returning\r\nto the negotiating table for bilateral dialogue.”\r\nThe representative of Pakistan has asserted that there\r\nis a threat to peace and security. I would request him to\r\nreconcile this with repeated statements of the Defence\r\nMinister of Pakistan discounting the possibility of war.\r\nThe same has been said by senior representatives of\r\nPakistan’s armed forces. Need I suggest that the purpose\r\nof the Pakistani eloquence in this General Assembly is\r\nsomewhat different?\r\nWhat is being concealed is Pakistan’s illicit desire\r\nfor Indian territory. In pursuit of this, Pakistan has used\r\nwar — and terrorism, on its own admission — as well as\r\nsophistry and chicanery.\r\nWe in India shall not succumb to any of this. We\r\nhave offered our hand of friendship to Pakistan. We have\r\nrepeatedly offered a bilateral dialogue to Pakistan. We\r\nhave consistently emphasized that the Simla Agreement\r\nof 1972, signed by President Bhutto of Pakistan and\r\nPrime Minister Indira Gandhi of India, remains very\r\nmuch in place, and is the only viable framework,\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nmutually agreed upon, under which such a bilateral\r\ndialogue with a view to settling differences can take place.\r\nFor the dialogue to resume, Pakistan merely has to\r\npropose a time and a place, either in India or in Pakistan,\r\nfor a meeting. No international intervention, no resolution,\r\nno new modality is required for such a dialogue. It would\r\nbe counterproductive.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): Our colleague from India has\r\nsought to deny what India is doing on the ground in\r\nKashmir. He has challenged the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations. The Secretary-General’s\r\nreport is objective and truthful. The falsehood emanates\r\nfrom New Delhi. The situation between India and Pakistan\r\nis tense because, for the past five years, India has sent an\r\narmy of over half a million men into Jammu and Kashmir.\r\nThis army is engaged in a campaign of repression and\r\ngenocide against the innocent Kashmiri people.\r\nThe Defence Minister of Pakistan has stated that there\r\nis no threat of war because Pakistan has exercised self-\r\nrestraint despite Indian provocations and has refused to\r\nanswer the provocations of India. It is for this reason that\r\nthere is no threat to war. In the month of August, Indian\r\nforces along the line of control violated the cease-fire line\r\n142 times. This is confirmed by the United Nations Military\r\nObserver Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP).\r\nIn the Indian press there are reports of daily killings.\r\nMr. Banyal, Hindustan Times, 13 October — a typical\r\nexample:\r\n“Not a single day passes when two or three dozen\r\npeople are not killed in the valley or other parts of the\r\nState of Jammu and Kashmir.”\r\nThe Indian Prime Minister held out a threat to\r\nPakistan, on 15 August, when he threatened to complete the\r\nunfinished task by regaining Azad Kashmir by force. This\r\nstatement was a virtual threat of war against Pakistan, and\r\nyet my colleague from India argues that there is no threat\r\nto peace. The Secretary-General is right; the representative\r\nof India is wrong.\r\nIndia blames Pakistan for instigating the tension by\r\nterrorism. But the Kashmiri struggle against a half-million-\r\nstrong Indian army is not terrorism. The Kashmiris have a\r\nright to self-defence in the exercise of their right to self-\r\ndetermination. This is their inherent, inborn right, and no\r\none can take this away from them. India is responsible for\r\nState terrorism against the Kashmiri people and Pakistan\r\ncondemns this State terrorism which India resorts to.\r\nPakistan has offered monitoring of the line of control by\r\nUNMOGIP. We have proposed to strengthen UNMOGIP\r\nfrom 35 to 200 observers. I hope India can accept that\r\noffer so that India’s allegations of cross-border assistance\r\nto the Kashmiris can be verified by these observers.\r\nAnyone is free to visit any part of Azad Kashmir or\r\nany part of Pakistan. I hope India can say the same about\r\nIndian-held Jammu and Kashmir.\r\nIndia blames everything wrong that happens within\r\nIndia on Pakistan. Recently, a distinguished Indian deputy\r\nopposition leader claimed that Pakistan had sent infested\r\nrats into Kashmir to spread the plague. This is the extent\r\nof the depravity of the thought processes that take place\r\nin India.\r\nIndia offers bilateral dialogue to Pakistan and does\r\nnot want intercession by any third party. But the only two\r\nagreements concluded between India and Pakistan were\r\nconcluded with the intercession of third parties: the one\r\nconcerning the Rann of Kush dispute and the Indus\r\nWaters Treaty. No dispute — no major dispute —\r\nbetween India and Pakistan has ever been resolved\r\nthrough bilateral means. What India wants through\r\nbilateralism is simply hegemonism, Indian diktat — and\r\nPakistan is not prepared to submit to Indian diktat.\r\nIndia talks about bilateralism. Ten rounds of talks\r\nwere held in 1972; seven rounds of talks were held\r\nbetween 1990 and 1993. At each round of talks, India\r\ntook the position that Jammu and Kashmir was an integral\r\npart of India and that there was nothing to talk about.\r\nThere is an inherent contradiction in the Indian position.\r\nIf they are prepared to discuss the Jammu and Kashmir\r\ndispute, then\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 October 1994\r\nit cannot be an integral part of India. Let India say this\r\nopenly, and let India halt its war against the Kashmiri\r\npeople, and we can resume talks, we can reach an\r\nagreement, we can conclude peace with India, we can clasp\r\nhands in friendship and bring prosperity to over a billion\r\npeople. But let India stop its killing in Kashmir.\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded the\r\npresent stage of its consideration of agenda item 10.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.55 p.m.\r\n34\r\n"
