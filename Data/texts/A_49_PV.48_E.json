(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Biegman\r\n(Netherlands), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 11\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/49/2)\r\nThe President: I call on the President of the Security\r\nCouncil to introduce the report of the Security Council.\r\nSir David Hannay (United Kingdom), President of\r\nthe Security Council: I am delighted to have this\r\nopportunity to address the General Assembly as President\r\nof the Security Council, albeit on the last day of my\r\npresidency, and to introduce the annual report of the\r\nCouncil covering the period from 16 June 1993 to\r\n15 June 1994 (A/49/2).\r\nThe members of the Security Council attach the very\r\ngreatest importance to the timely preparation and\r\nsubmission of the annual report to the General Assembly,\r\nas provided for in Articles 15 and 24 of the United Nations\r\nCharter. In presenting this annual report to the Assembly,\r\nI have sought to follow the practice established last year by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Brazil. That is to say, the\r\ndraft of this annual report was issued to all Member States\r\nand was adopted at a public meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil, not at a closed meeting, as in the past.\r\nConsideration of the Council’s report by the General\r\nAssembly constitutes an important occasion for a\r\nsubstantive dialogue and interaction between these two\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, a dialogue which\r\nwill, I hope, touch not just on the nature of the report\r\npresented to the Assembly today, but also on the\r\nsubstance of the issues before the Security Council.\r\nAs has been the case with past reports, the report I\r\nam introducing this year reflects the heavy workload of\r\nthe Council in responding to problems related to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. As the\r\nreport notes, during the period under consideration the\r\nCouncil held 153 formal meetings, adopted 87 resolutions\r\nand agreed 68 statements by the President. In addition,\r\nCouncil members held 252 consultations of the whole,\r\ntotalling some 353 hours. Other members of the Council\r\nparticipating in this debate may wish to comment on the\r\nsubstance of that work. It is not for me, as President of\r\nthe Security Council, to do so, except perhaps to note, as\r\nour Brazilian colleague did last year, that the voluminous\r\ncontent of the document before the Assembly reflects the\r\nvaried and complex nature of the challenges posed to\r\ninternational peace and security and the justified\r\nexpectation of Member States that the Security Council\r\nshould respond to them.\r\nThe members of the Security Council listened\r\ncarefully to the proposals made in the debate in this Hall\r\nlast year upon the Council’s report, and also to debates\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nelsewhere in this Organization, on how the work of the\r\nCouncil can be made more transparent and more accessible\r\nto non-members of the Council. In June 1993 the Council\r\nestablished an informal Working Group on documentation\r\nand other procedural matters. That Working Group has met\r\nregularly — virtually on a monthly basis — and a number\r\nof steps have been taken following recommendations by the\r\nGroup. First and foremost among them are the changes to\r\nthe annual report itself. The introduction to the report has\r\nbeen made more substantive and, like last year, the\r\nappendices listing resolutions and presidential statements\r\nnow provide cross-references to the relevant chapter,\r\nsection and sub-section of the report for each resolution and\r\npresidential statement. Further changes remain under\r\nconsideration by the Working Group. While I would not\r\nwish to stand here and tell the Assembly that this is a user-\r\nfriendly document, I would suggest that it is a slightly less\r\nuser-unfriendly document than the reports of two or three\r\nyears ago.\r\nIn addition, the Council decided in March 1994 that\r\ndraft resolutions in their “blue”, or provisional, form would\r\nbe made available for collection by non-members of the\r\nCouncil as soon as they were circulated. Also, in July 1993\r\nthe Council decided to make available to all Member States\r\nthe tentative forecast of the programme of work of the\r\nCouncil for each month. This year the practice has been\r\ninstituted of annexing to the forecast a list of forthcoming\r\nreports by the Secretary-General as requested by the\r\nCouncil as well as the schedule of forthcoming reviews or\r\nrenewals of mandates of peace-keeping operations and of\r\nsanctions regimes. Also, as part of the effort to improve the\r\ndocumentation of the Council and make its work more\r\naccessible, the Working Group has been reviewing the list\r\nof matters of which the Council is seized. This year a large\r\nnumber of items has again been removed from the list.\r\nItems are removed only after extensive consideration and\r\nappropriate consultation. Neither the removal of a matter\r\nfrom the list nor its retention carries any implication for the\r\nsubstance of the matter. But the exercise is a necessary one\r\nof rationalization.\r\nThe Working Group has also given consideration to\r\nthe important question of ways of briefing Member States\r\non the progress of informal consultations without\r\nprejudicing the confidentiality and the efficiency of the\r\nconsultations system itself, and the first informal presidency\r\nbriefing of non-members on the current work of the\r\nCouncil was held on 27 October 1994.\r\nFinally, there has been much consideration this year in\r\nthe Council of ways to enhance consultations and\r\nexchanges of information with troop-contributing\r\ncountries regarding peace-keeping operations, including\r\ntheir planning, management and coordination, particularly\r\nwhen significant extensions of an operation’s mandate are\r\nin prospect. The presidential statement of 3 May 1994\r\nmade certain recommendations in this regard. It also\r\ncommitted the Council to keeping under review\r\narrangements for communication with non-members of\r\nthe Council. This month, consideration is being given to\r\nfurther steps to improve these arrangements for\r\nconsultation, involving Member States, troop-contributing\r\ncountries, members of the Security Council and the\r\nSecretariat. I should just say that this morning we made\r\nsubstantial progress towards decisions on this matter,\r\nwhich will, I hope, not be long delayed.\r\nAs indicated in the introduction to the Security\r\nCouncil’s report, the report is not intended as a substitute\r\nfor the official records of the Security Council, which\r\nprovide a more substantive account of its deliberations.\r\nThus the report should be read, for the purposes of this\r\ndiscussion in the General Assembly too, in conjunction\r\nwith other official documents of the Council, to which it\r\nconstitutes a reference guide.\r\nIn conclusion, I would just say that the members of\r\nthe Security Council will, I am sure, listen attentively to\r\nthe debate we are holding here today. They welcome this\r\nopportunity for a substantive dialogue; I hope that\r\nmembers of the Assembly will see by the way we have\r\nresponded in the past year that this is not just a polite\r\nphrase that we use. We are listening, and we will take\r\ninto consideration points that are put forward in this\r\ndebate.\r\nThe President: I wish to propose that the list of\r\nspeakers in the debate on this item be closed at 4 p.m.\r\ntoday.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Wisnumurti (Indonesia): It is a distinct honour\r\nand privilege for me to deliver this statement on behalf of\r\nthe non-aligned countries on the agenda item before us,\r\nnamely, the report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly, to which we attach great importance.I should\r\nlike at the outset to commend the President of the\r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador David Hannay, for his\r\nlucid introduction of the Council’s annual report.\r\nThe report highlights, among other things, a number\r\nof procedural methods adopted by the Council with a\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nview to enhancing the efficiency of its work. We hope that\r\nthese could constitute a basis upon which to build our\r\nendeavours to strengthen its efficacy further. I also share\r\nAmbassador Hannay’s view that the consideration of the\r\nreport provides an opportunity, not only for a meaningful\r\ndialogue on the nature of the report, but also on the\r\nsubstantive issues considered by the Council.\r\nRecent developments in world affairs have placed the\r\nSecurity Council in a position of pre-eminence which has\r\nramifications for the work of the United Nations and\r\nbeyond it. Numerous circumstances have also contributed\r\nto an unprecedented number of activities undertaken by that\r\naugust body. The steady expansion of peace-keeping\r\noperations in various parts of the world has seized the\r\nCouncil of an active agenda. We note with interest that the\r\ncooperative spirit prevailing among the members of the\r\nCouncil has facilitated the adoption of unanimous positions\r\non some complex disputes, while we are also cognizant of\r\nits failure to resolve certain critical issues effectively. The\r\nCouncil has thus reached a critical turning-point and\r\nMember States look forward to its more effective role as\r\nthe obstacles which paralysed it for so long continue to be\r\nremoved.\r\nIt is in this context that the countries of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement views the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly in document A/49/2. As\r\nin the past, the Council provides a comprehensive account\r\nof its activities during the preceding year and describes its\r\ntask in the context of its ever-increasing responsibilities. It\r\nalso contains a compendium of communications and other\r\ndocuments, as well as a listing of decisions and actions\r\ntaken on the issues that were brought before it.\r\nIt cannot, however, be denied that the hopes expressed\r\nby an overwhelming majority of the international\r\ncommunity that the report would be transformed from a\r\ndescriptive account to a document that would analyse the\r\nissues dealt with by the Security Council have been\r\ndisappointed. It is particularly regrettable that the report\r\ndoes not contain an evaluation of the issues considered by\r\nthe Council and a detailed account of the work of its\r\nspecial committees. Despite its voluminous nature, the\r\nreport is not a document of a substance commensurate with\r\nthe greatly expanded role of the Security Council. It is,\r\ntherefore, the considered view of the members of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement that the annual report mandated in\r\nArticle 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter must be more than\r\na mere description of activities and a reproduction of\r\nresolutions already known. It should instead contain\r\nanalyses and an assessment of the decisions taken on\r\nvarious issues in order to meet the need for greater clarity\r\nand understanding of the Council’s reasonings and\r\nmotives in adopting decisions.\r\nThe non-aligned countries take the view that the\r\nattainment of these objectives would be further promoted\r\nby the strict implementation of Article 15, paragraph 1,\r\nand Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter pertaining to\r\nspecial reports of the Security Council, in particular, on\r\nthe measures that it has decided upon or taken to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has also\r\nadopted a forthright position on a number of issues\r\npertaining to the functioning and operation of the Security\r\nCouncil, especially those relating to equity, equality and\r\ndemocratization in the decision-making process, the\r\nCouncil’s relationship with the other principal organs of\r\nthe United Nations and its procedures and practices. The\r\ncommuniqué issued by the Ministerial Meeting of the\r\nNon-Aligned Countries held at Cairo last June reiterated\r\nthe need for the faithful observance of the Charter\r\nprovisions concerning the role of the Security Council in\r\norder to achieve a better balance with the other principal\r\norgans of the United Nations, especially the General\r\nAssembly. Article 24, paragraph 1, of the Charter states,\r\nin part, that the Members of the United Nations:\r\n“confer on the Security Council primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and agree that...the Security\r\nCouncil acts on their behalf.”\r\nHence, the Security Council, in carrying out its duty\r\nunder this provision, is accountable to the general\r\nmembership.\r\nThe Cairo communiqué further stressed the\r\nimportance of enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency\r\nof the Council by adopting a number of measures geared\r\nto reforming its working methods and procedures,\r\nparticularly in the context of an improved relationship\r\nwith the General Assembly and non-members of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nWith regard to greater transparency in the Council’s\r\ndecision-making processes the Cairo communiqué called\r\nfor an increased number of both formal and informal\r\nmeetings prior to the adoption of decisions, thereby\r\nallowing for wider participation. Other measures include\r\nthe participation of non-members in informal\r\nconsultations, full and informative press releases and the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nprovision of tentative monthly programmes that will keep\r\nMember States fully informed of the nature and scope of\r\nthe Council’s activities.\r\nAn effective and timely flow of information can also\r\nbe facilitated through, inter alia, the institutionalization of\r\nconsultations between the Presidents of the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council. In this connection, we\r\nurge the President of the General Assembly to propose\r\nappropriate ways and means to facilitate an in-depth\r\ndiscussion by the Assembly on matters contained in the\r\nreports submitted to it by the Security Council, as mandated\r\nby General Assembly resolution 48/264.\r\nYet another aspect of transparency is the need for\r\ninstitutionalizing an appropriate mechanism for direct\r\nconsultations between the Security Council, the Secretariat\r\nand interested States, especially the troop-contributing\r\ncountries, on the establishment and conduct of peace-\r\nkeeping operations. Equally important in this regard is the\r\nparticipation of interested non-members in any subsidiary\r\norgans established by the Council to monitor developments\r\nin various parts of the world.\r\nIt is also pertinent to recall that both the Cairo\r\nConference and the Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned\r\nCountries held in New York early this month reaffirmed the\r\nview of the Jakarta Summit Meeting that the exercise of\r\nveto, which guarantees an exclusive and dominant role for\r\nthe permanent members of the Security Council, is\r\nincompatible with the aim of democratizing the Council.\r\nThe right of veto was accorded as a result of exceptional\r\nhistorical circumstances that no longer prevail. The Council\r\nas a body purports to act on behalf of all Member States,\r\nand its decisions are binding. Hence, none of its members\r\nshould negate the majority view or frustrate the\r\nachievement of consensus. We are aware that this\r\nprerogative is rarely used in recent times, but there are no\r\nassurances that it will not be used again with negative\r\nrepercussions. The veto provision should therefore be\r\nreviewed.\r\nIn short, the non-aligned countries are committed to a\r\ntruly representative, transparent and democratized Security\r\nCouncil which would reflect the current configuration of\r\nmembership.\r\nThe non-aligned countries note the positive response\r\nof the Security Council in implementing proposals relating\r\nto its working methods and procedures, including the\r\nadoption and timely submission of reports to the General\r\nAssembly and the inclusion of its provisional agenda in the\r\nJournal. We also foresee the possibility of the adoption\r\nby the Council of further concrete measures that would\r\nstrengthen its role in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. In the same spirit, we remain hopeful\r\nthat it would be responsive to change both in its\r\ncomposition and in its procedures and practices. In these\r\nendeavours, the Non-Aligned Movement is fully\r\ncommitted to rendering the Council more responsive in\r\nmeeting emerging challenges and opportunities.\r\nFinally, the non-aligned countries propose that this\r\nagenda item be kept open until such time as the President\r\nhas concluded his consultations as called for in resolution\r\n48/264 and has informed the General Assembly of the\r\nresults of those consultations.\r\nMr. Razali (Malaysia): May I first welcome with\r\ngreat appreciation the presence and effort of the President\r\nof the Security Council, Sir David Hannay, who has come\r\nhere to present the report of the Security Council. We see\r\nhis presence as indicative of future prospects and of a\r\nprogressive understanding of the need to establish a basis\r\nof dialogue between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMy delegation would like to express our appreciation\r\nto the President of the General Assembly for deferring\r\nconsideration of this important agenda item from 26\r\nOctober to 31 October. This decision was necessary\r\nbecause the Council’s 552-page report (A/49/2) was made\r\navailable to delegations only on 24 October. The\r\nincreasing number of speakers on this agenda item makes\r\nclear the significance delegations attach to the work and\r\nfunctioning of the Council. The general membership is\r\nsending the message that it is both interested in\r\nexamining and has the right to examine the affairs of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement has\r\njust conveyed the views of the Movement on this report.\r\nThe Malaysian delegation fully supports his statement.\r\nMy delegation would now like to highlight and reiterate\r\nsome of our views on the issues under consideration.\r\nThe four-part report begins with an introduction,\r\nwhich rightly recalls the legislative basis for the\r\nsubmission of the report: namely, Article 24, paragraph 3,\r\nand Article 15, paragraph 1 of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. From the viewpoint of the General Assembly, it\r\nis equally necessary to emphasize that the debate on this\r\nitem is consistent with Article 10, which says:\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\n“The General Assembly may discuss any\r\nquestions or any matters within the scope of the\r\npresent Charter or relating to the powers and functions\r\nof any organs provided for in the present Charter, and,\r\nexcept as provided in Article 12, may make\r\nrecommendations to the Members of the United\r\nNations or to the Security Council or to both on any\r\nsuch questions or matters.”\r\nOur deliberations today should focus on the decisions\r\nand actions of the Council. After all, in Article 24,\r\nparagraph 1, it is recognized that the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations have conferred\r\n“on the Security Council primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and\r\nagree that in carrying out its duties under this\r\nresponsibility the Security Council acts on their\r\nbehalf.”\r\nAs the Working Group on the expansion and reform\r\nof the Council proceeds, many of us will seek to utilize the\r\nfull implications of this Article to bring into being not only\r\nan equitably expanded Council, but also one that truly\r\nreflects the moral and political authority of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nAs in the past, the report contains a compendium of\r\ncommunications and other documents as well as a listing of\r\ndecisions and actions taken by the Council. In this regard,\r\nthe request of the vast majority of Member States for an\r\nanalytical and substantive report has not been met. The\r\nCouncil has also failed to submit special reports, as\r\nprovided for in Article 15, paragraph 1, of the Charter, to\r\nthe Members of the United Nations. The General Assembly\r\nshould have benefited from special reports on issues such\r\nas those concerning Rwanda or Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe States Members of the United Nations have a\r\nlegitimate right to full details of the Council’s actions on\r\nvarious issues.\r\nPart I of the report, entitled “Questions considered by\r\nthe Security Council under its responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security”, identifies\r\nspecific issues and the decisions it took on them. For the\r\npurposes of our debate today, my delegation would like to\r\naddress the decisions of the Council pertaining to two\r\nissues: “The situation concerning Rwanda”, as reflected in\r\npages 180 to 211, and “Items relating to the situation in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia”, from pages 67 to 161.\r\nAccording to the report, on the issue of “The\r\nsituation concerning Rwanda” the Council had 12\r\nmeetings, adopted eight resolutions and issued four\r\npresidential statements. Yet, among all these resolutions\r\nand presidential statements, there is no explanation as to\r\nhow the Council could have countenanced the death and\r\nmaiming of thousands of people, generally considered\r\ngenocide by the vast majority of mankind. Between the\r\nadoption of resolution 872 (1993) of 5 October 1993 and\r\nthe adoption of resolution 918 (1994) of 17 May 1994,\r\nthousands of innocent people in Rwanda died, before the\r\nCouncil decided to strengthen United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping operations there. The initial decision to reduce\r\nthe United Nations presence in Rwanda could be\r\ninterpreted, with the benefit of hindsight, as having\r\ncontributed to the calamity that befell that country.\r\nThe crisis in Rwanda has been acknowledged as the\r\nmost tragic humanitarian crisis of our time. During the\r\nbloodletting the General Assembly received no special\r\nreports from the Council. In essence, the United Nations,\r\nrepresenting the international community, cannot avoid\r\nsome kind of responsibility for failing to prevent the\r\nkilling of so many thousands of people and the huge\r\ninflux of refugees into the countries around Rwanda. The\r\ndebate on Rwanda and the failure of the United Nations\r\nrole there must be properly reflected, and lessons must be\r\nlearned, not only in the Council, but also in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn the case of the situation in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nthe report carries a number of sub-items, which include\r\n“The situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia”, “Applications made under Article 50 of the\r\nCharter”, “The situation in the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina”, “United Nations Protection Force”,\r\n“Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(CSCE) Missions”, “Establishment of an international\r\ntribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for\r\nserious violations of international humanitarian law\r\ncommitted in the territory of the former Yugoslavia” and\r\n“The situation in Croatia”.\r\nThe Council considered the issue at 35 meetings and\r\nadopted 16 resolutions, and 18 presidential statements\r\nwere made, during the period under review. It is all too\r\nevident that, despite all this activity, aggression against\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and “ethnic cleansing” have not\r\nceased. Indeed, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nnot only has the Council not enforced its own decisions\r\nand resolutions, but it has impeded Bosnia and\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nHerzegovina’s exercise of its inherent right to self-defence.\r\nThe issues of both Rwanda and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina underline the importance of, and the special\r\nneed for, the Council’s seeking wider consultations. Such\r\nan approach would help arrest — or, at least, moderate —\r\na tendency on the part of certain influential members to\r\nconsider issues before the Council purely through their own\r\npolitical prism. It will be increasingly untenable to maintain\r\nthat the Council is above the rest of the United Nations and\r\nthat the five permanent members can individually or\r\ncollectively continue with their actions in the Council with\r\nno means of making these actions accountable, to any\r\nextent, to the general membership. We have also had\r\nsituations in which permanent members, despite initial\r\nqualms and reservations, chose to go along in order to\r\nmaintain the cohesion of the five permanent members. In\r\nthe days of the cold war the actions of the Council were\r\ncheckmated by the East-West pull and counter-pull. Now,\r\nin the name of cohesion of the five permanent members,\r\nthe Council is becoming an “omni” organization, a cabal of\r\nfive, protected by the Charter from being answerable to the\r\ngeneral membership.\r\nAn overall assessment of the work of the Council\r\nwould indicate that the Council remains locked in paralysis,\r\nwith some influential members weighing the political,\r\nfinancial and manpower costs of getting involved in crises.\r\nThe Council’s unwillingness to enforce its own resolutions\r\nand respect the General Assembly, as in the case of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, could definitely undermine the credibility\r\nand faith placed in the Council and the concept of United\r\nNations collective security.\r\nAs the body which, under the Charter, has the primary\r\nresponsibility for international peace and security, the\r\nSecurity Council, in carrying out its responsibilities on\r\nbehalf of the Members of the United Nations, must act in\r\nconformity with the provisions of the Charter, particularly\r\nArticle 24. In this regard, the Council, before taking major\r\ndecisions or action, is duty-bound to consult regional\r\ngroups, troop-contributing countries and the general\r\nmembership.\r\nMy delegation notes with appreciation the positive\r\nchanges instituted by the Council with regard to its work\r\nand documentation. The release of the tentative forecast and\r\nthe availability of some documents have created a sense of\r\npositive responsiveness, on the part of the Council, to the\r\nMembers of the United Nations. Indeed, last Thursday the\r\nPresident of the Council organized a briefing for\r\ndelegations. Welcome as they are, however, these changes\r\nremain inadequate. They must be broadened, accelerated\r\nand institutionalized. It is not the intention of my\r\ndelegation to dwell on details at this stage. We shall go\r\ninto detail in the Working Group on the expansion and\r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nThe Members of the Organization must have\r\nunimpeded access to the Council for the purpose of\r\naddressing it in open public meetings to make their\r\npronouncements on major and current issues impacting on\r\ninternational peace and security. Those of us who sought\r\nto participate in the Council debate immediately after the\r\nmassacre at Hebron, for instance, are no doubt fully\r\naware of the tactics employed to dissuade Member States\r\nfrom making such pronouncements. The practice of\r\npreventing a debate, without even the use of the veto,\r\nmust be rejected in no uncertain terms.\r\nThe General Assembly’s resolution 48/264 invited its\r\nPresident\r\n“to propose appropriate ways and means to facilitate\r\nan in-depth discussion by the Assembly of matters\r\ncontained in the reports submitted to it by the\r\nSecurity Council”. (resolution 48/264, para.4)\r\nIn line with that resolution, discussion of this agenda item\r\nshould remain open to enable appropriate follow-up\r\naction.\r\nMr. Mishra (India): The report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/49/2) follows the\r\nfamiliar pattern. It is a valuable compendium of the\r\npapers that emanated from the Security Council during\r\nthe period 16 June 1993 to 15 June 1994, with a bland\r\nnarration of the sequence of events. Historians and\r\nresearchers will find it an excellent reference manual —\r\na guide to the activities of the Council, as the report itself\r\nclaims. They will have the advantage of having in one\r\nplace all the material necessary to learn about the breadth\r\nof the activities of the Security Council during the period\r\nin question.\r\nHowever, the question being asked, particularly in\r\nrecent years, is whether the report really fulfils the\r\nobligations imposed on the Security Council by the\r\nCharter, in Article 24, paragraph 3, and whether the\r\nGeneral Assembly has been enabled to carry out its own\r\nresponsibility under Article 15 of the Charter to receive\r\nand consider the report. It is not by accident that the\r\nreference to the annual and special reports of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly is made in Article 24.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nThat Article, in an earlier paragraph, speaks of the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly. It states clearly that “in carrying out its duties\r\nunder this responsibility” — namely, the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security — “the Security Council\r\nacts on their” — that is, Member States’ — “behalf”.\r\nThere is, therefore, an integral link between the\r\nSecurity Council’s role in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and its obligation to report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly once a year, if not more often. Similarly,\r\nthe General Assembly, under Article 15, shall receive and\r\nconsider\r\n“an account of the measures that the Security Council\r\nhas decided upon or taken to maintain international\r\npeace and security.”\r\nWe are grateful to the President of the General\r\nAssembly for readily agreeing to the request made by the\r\nnon-aligned countries this year to postpone the debate on\r\nthis item to enable those countries at least to look through\r\nthe 552 pages with which the Security Council has provided\r\nus. Originally, as will be recalled, the debate was to take\r\nplace within 48 hours of the report’s having been made\r\navailable to delegations. It appeared as though this debate\r\nwas a mere ritual and as though the contents of the report\r\nwere of no relevance or consequence. This year we have\r\nmade the point that there should be time for delegations to\r\nstudy the report and to comment on it after due\r\ndeliberation. The point to be stressed is that timely\r\nsubmission is important if the report is to receive the\r\nconsideration to which it is entitled under the Charter.\r\nIn considering this year’s report, we have the\r\nadvantage of having heard the views of Member States on\r\nreform of the Security Council, expressed in the Open-\r\nended Working Group of the General Assembly. Many\r\ndelegations, including mine, emphasized the importance of\r\nthe report’s becoming a true instrument of interaction\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly.\r\nThis can be achieved only if the report is made more\r\nsubstantive, more elaborate and more analytical. It should\r\nprovide an insight into the informal process that led to\r\ndecision-making so that we can make informed judgements\r\nwhich, in turn, will generate inputs that are of benefit to the\r\nSecurity Council itself. This is the very essence of the\r\nrelevant provisions of the Charter that I mentioned earlier,\r\nwhich were designed to give the general membership a\r\nsense of participation in the Council’s decision-making,\r\nwhich has serious implications for them. A sense of\r\nparticipation would greatly enhance the credibility and\r\nmoral authority of the Security Council.\r\nAnother purpose that an analytical report can serve\r\nis to demonstrate the extent to which the Charter’s\r\nprovisions concerning the division of work have been\r\nfollowed. The Charter envisages a careful balance\r\nbetween the principal organs of the Organization,\r\nespecially the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil. A balanced relationship between the Council and\r\nthe Assembly is of paramount importance, and this can be\r\nachieved only if the need for strict observance of their\r\nrespective roles, as stipulated in the Charter, is kept in\r\nmind. The General Assembly has to remain watchful to\r\nensure that issues that are extraneous to the mandate of\r\nthe Security Council do not get dragged into it.\r\nWe are aware that in recent years the Security\r\nCouncil has brought about some improvements in its\r\nworking methods — for example, listing in the daily\r\nJournal the subjects for informal consultations;\r\ndistribution of the monthly programme to the general\r\nmembership; and briefings by the President. These are\r\nsmall steps, but they do go in the right direction, and the\r\nCouncil should be encouraged to take more innovative\r\nsteps to enhance transparency and democratization.\r\nInterestingly, though, even the improvements that the\r\nCouncil itself has authorized do not figure in its report.\r\nOne area in which the immediate interests of\r\nMember States that are not members of the Council are\r\naffected is peace-keeping. The considerable increase in\r\nthe number of operations and the fact that most troop-\r\ncontributing countries are not members of the Council\r\nmake it imperative that the non-members, particularly\r\ntroop-contributors, be involved in the decision-making on\r\npeace-keeping. This is particularly important when\r\ndecisions relating to the size, mandate and other aspects\r\nof the existing major operations are taken.\r\nWhile speaking of reform of the Security Council\r\nwith a view to enhancing its credibility and authority, one\r\ncannot miss the point that the most important reform\r\nrequired is to make the Council truly representative, in\r\nterms of numbers as well as of the global power structure,\r\nof present-day realities. Together with other like-minded\r\ncountries, India proposed in 1979 that this matter should\r\nbe examined. Today, there is general recognition that both\r\nthe permanent and the non-permanent categories of\r\nmembership of the Council should be expanded. While\r\ncriteria are established for non-permanent members, no\r\nsuch criteria exist for permanent members. We have\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nalready spelt out some relevant criteria in our statement in\r\nthis year’s general debate. These should be developed and\r\nadopted before nominating any country for permanent\r\nmembership.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that the report of\r\nthe Security Council should be more analytical in future\r\nand, more important, we should set in place a regular\r\nsystem of exchange between the General Assembly and an\r\nappropriately expanded Security Council. An effective\r\nmechanism is required for this if the general membership\r\nis to be reassured that the Council is accountable to the\r\nAssembly and is confining itself to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security by acting in strict\r\nconformity with the provisions of the Charter.\r\nMrs. Hassan (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): At\r\nthe outset, the delegation of Egypt wishes to thank the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly for having deferred\r\nconsideration of the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly thus making it possible for a larger\r\nnumber of delegations to study and examine the report and\r\nto consider all its contents.\r\nThe delegation of Egypt wishes also to extend its\r\nappreciation to the Permanent Representative of the United\r\nKingdom, this month’s President of the Council, for\r\nintroducing the report to the Assembly. This practice, which\r\nstarted last year when the Permanent Representative of\r\nBrazil introduced the report to the General Assembly, is a\r\nstep in the right direction towards more progress in the\r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Charter with regard\r\nto the responsibility of the Security Council vis-à-vis the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The practice also reflects a new spirit of\r\ncooperation which deserves appreciation.\r\nThe annual debate that takes place in the General\r\nAssembly when the Assembly considers the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, which is submitted to it in accordance\r\nwith Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter, affords all Members\r\nof the Organization the opportunity of exchanging views\r\nregarding the development of the Security Council’s\r\nactivities, to take note of the Council’s achievements and its\r\nattitudes on certain complex issues while taking note, at the\r\nsame time, of any shortcomings in the Council’s handling\r\nof other issues. The debate is also an occasion that makes\r\nit possible for conducting the necessary dialogue and vital\r\ninteraction between the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil. Such dialogue and interaction are bound to support\r\nand strengthen the respective roles of the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council in discharging their mandates with\r\nregard to maintaining international peace and security in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Charter. In addition,\r\nthe debate is a significant occasion that highlights the\r\naccountability of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly and reflects the proper balance between these\r\ntwo main bodies of the United Nations.\r\nThe consideration by the General Assembly of the\r\nSecurity Council’s report acquires special and increasing\r\nsignificance from the vital role of the Security Council in\r\nthe international arena, especially in view of the\r\nincreasing complexity of the international situation and\r\nthe deterioration of peace and security in several regions\r\nin a manner that has redoubled the Council’s activities\r\nand greatly increased its responsibilities. This has led to\r\na great deal of justified interest in the Security Council’s\r\nactivities on the part of the Member States in particular\r\nand the international community in general.\r\nMr. Seniloli (Fiji) Vice-President took the Chair.\r\nEgypt’s delegation welcomes the report submitted by\r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly this year,\r\nin document A/49/2. In fact, the submission of this report\r\nperiodically, on time, is in line with the responsibility and\r\nthe mandate conferred on the members of the Security\r\nCouncil by the Member States of the Organization in\r\naccordance with Article 24 and the requirements of\r\nArticle 15 of the Charter.\r\nWe also welcome the adoption of the report in an\r\nopen meeting of the Security Council and its issuance as\r\na limited circulation document before it is considered and\r\nadopted as is the case in all the other bodies of the United\r\nNations. We also encourage the continued distribution of\r\nthe monthly work programme of the Council to all United\r\nNations missions as this contributes to the flow of\r\ninformation and welcome the listing of the Council’s\r\nmeetings in the Journal. All these measures, by\r\nthemselves, constitute a step in the right direction towards\r\nthe aim of increased transparency. However, such\r\nmeasures, for all their positive nature, do not rise to the\r\nlevel of our expectations.\r\nThere is an urgent need for further measures. This\r\nrequires the members of the Security Council to continue\r\nto work for the adoption of additional measures to\r\nimprove the Council’s procedures in a manner that would\r\nmeet the expectations and respond to the views and\r\nproposals of the Members of the General Assembly in\r\nthis respect.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nOn many occasions, Egypt has called for the report of\r\nthe Security Council to give an objective and analytical\r\naccount of all the activities undertaken by the Council in\r\ndischarging its responsibilities, particularly at a time when\r\nthose responsibilities are increasing qualitatively and\r\nquantitatively. This means that the General Assembly, in its\r\ncapacity as the world body, should be fully informed of the\r\nessence of the Council’s work. This is a particularly urgent\r\nrequirement in view of the fact that the Council, in\r\nconducting its business, resorts as a matter of routine to\r\ninformal consultations, a practice which makes it difficult\r\nfor the full membership of the Organization to obtain\r\ntimely and open information on the Council’s work.\r\nUnfortunately, the Security Council’s report under\r\nreview this year is a conform copy of previous reports, with\r\nthe exception of a more detailed introduction and two\r\nappendices: appendix VII containing communications from\r\nthe President of the Security Council or the Secretary-\r\nGeneral during the period covered by the report; and\r\nappendix VIII containing the reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral issued during the period covered by the report.\r\nApart from these two innovations, which do not rise\r\nto the level of expectations of the majority of Member\r\nStates, the report, regardless of its bulkiness, is not, in our\r\nestimation, a substantive or objective document that could\r\nbe described as commensurate with the increasingly\r\nimportant role performed by the Security Council. Simply\r\nstated, the report is a compilation of the resolutions\r\nadopted, and various communications and documents issued\r\nduring the period it covers, all of which are common\r\nknowledge as everyone has already seen and perused them.\r\nThe report, on the other hand, is devoid of any analysis or\r\nevaluation of the resolutions adopted on the many disputes\r\nthe Council has dealt with nor does it include any hint at\r\nany explanation that would shed any light, even a\r\ngeneralized sort of light on the closed informal\r\nconsultations. Consequently, the report, in our opinion, falls\r\nshort of satisfying the desire of the overwhelming majority\r\nof Member States for more clarity and understanding of the\r\nCouncil’s thinking and motives. Therefore, it is not possible\r\nto analyse the Council’s activities properly. Having said\r\nthis, we must say that we stress this point because it is\r\nclosely linked with the whole question of the representative\r\nnature of the Council and its political responsibility vis-à-\r\nvis the General Assembly. We all know that the first\r\nparagraph of Article 24 of the Charter states that the\r\nSecurity Council acts on behalf of the Member States and\r\nwe realize that it is from this conferred responsibility that\r\nthe Council derives its legitimacy.\r\nThe increased activity of the Security Council puts\r\na great responsibility on the United Nations, a\r\nresponsibility that is shared by all the Member States of\r\nthe United Nations, not only from a political standpoint,\r\nbut also in a material context. Consequently, the very\r\nleast the Member States expect from the Council is a flow\r\nof objective and timely information. This leads us to\r\nhighlight a few points which, unfortunately, have not been\r\ncovered in the report: First, the activities of the subsidiary\r\nbodies of the Security Council, activities which are of\r\ninterest to a large number of Member States; second, the\r\nimplementation of the Council’s resolutions on the issues\r\nit has dealt with; and third, an evaluation of peace-\r\nkeeping operations. All these are important issues which,\r\nbecause of their impact on a large number of countries,\r\nshould not be absent from a report that genuinely reflects\r\nthe activities of the Security Council.\r\nThe dialogue between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council is vital and essential if these two main\r\nbodies are fully to discharge their responsibilities with\r\nregard to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. In this connection, it may be appropriate to\r\nrecall that Article 11 of the Charter makes the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security a shared\r\nresponsibility of the two bodies. The General Assembly\r\nis empowered to consider the general principles of\r\ncooperation in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, to discuss questions relating to such questions\r\nand to make recommendations with regard to any such\r\nquestions to the Member States or to the Security Council\r\nor to both. It follows from this that the special\r\nresponsibility vested in the Security Council with regard\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security\r\ndetracts not at all from the mandate of the General\r\nAssembly in this respect. Hence the importance of the\r\nindispensable balanced relationship between the two\r\nbodies if they are fully to discharge their responsibilities\r\nin a coordinated fashion.\r\nIn this connection and in view of the importance of\r\nsuch balance, the delegation of Egypt wishes to stress the\r\nfollowing points.\r\nFirst, there is a need for more transparency in the\r\ndecision-making process in the Security Council. In order\r\nto achieve this, it is proposed that a greater number of\r\nformal meetings be held before decisions are taken. This\r\nwould ensure the widest possible participation. Also, the\r\ncountries directly concerned should be allowed to take\r\npart in the Council’s informal consultations. A\r\ncomprehensive information system should be set up to\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nprovide all Member States with information. This could\r\ninclude the circulation of bulletins to brief the Member\r\nStates with regard to the informal consultations of the\r\nSecurity Council, together with any other practical measures\r\nthat would ensure the flow of information.\r\nSecond, a more dynamic relationship should exist\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly. In\r\nthis respect, the reports submitted by the Security Council\r\nto the General Assembly should be full of objective and\r\ntimely information on the activities of the Council and of\r\nits subsidiary bodies. Exchange of views between the two\r\nbodies should be promoted through the institutionalization\r\nof consultations between the President of the General\r\nAssembly and the President of the Security Council.\r\nFurthermore, regular direct consultations between the\r\nSecurity Council and the troop-contributing countries should\r\nalso be institutionalized with regard to the taking of\r\ndecisions on the setting up and management of peace-\r\nkeeping operations. The ideal means of guaranteeing the\r\neffectiveness of the Council’s resolutions and ensuring their\r\nlegitimacy can be found only in expanding the basis of\r\nparticipation by those States that are not members of the\r\nSecurity Council. In this connection, a number of initiatives\r\nhave been made and we wish to support the joint initiative\r\nput forward by Argentina and New Zealand.\r\nFinally, I wish to refer to the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. Egypt has taken part in the debate held\r\non agenda item 33 regarding the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and in the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group and will continue to participate in trying to\r\nrectify the existing imbalances with the aim of enhancing\r\nthe Security Council’s effectiveness and credibility.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to state that the spirit and letter\r\nof the Charter make it essential that the General\r\nAssembly’s consideration of the Security Council’s report\r\nshould not be limited simply to taking note of the report\r\nwithout making the necessary recommendations. It is our\r\nhope that, in future, things will happen somewhat\r\ndifferently.\r\nMr. Kalpage (Sri Lanka): My delegation has listened\r\nwith considerable interest to the introductory remarks of the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Sir David Hannay,\r\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom. His\r\nintroduction of the report of the Security Council before the\r\nGeneral Assembly follows a welcome precedent, which we\r\nhope will also be a regular feature in future.\r\nThe list of speakers for this item this year is longer\r\nthan that of last year. This indicates the growing interest\r\nthe report of the Council is evoking. The debate should\r\nnot be seen as an opportunity to pillory the Council. On\r\nthe contrary, interest in the report reflects the strong\r\ndesire among all Members to enhance the effectiveness\r\nand efficiency of the Council.\r\nThis is due to a number of factors: First, the United\r\nNations, particularly through the Security Council, not\r\nonly is now involved more deeply in fulfilling its\r\ntraditional functions, but is entering into uncharted areas\r\nof activity which profoundly affect all States. Secondly,\r\nin the current international situation, which has, overall,\r\nbeen categorized as positive, a healthy feeling prevails\r\nthat transparency is vital to promote effectively the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter. Thirdly, the wider\r\nis the extent of understanding about Council decisions, the\r\ngreater will be their acceptance and the better the prospect\r\nof decisions being efficiently and effectively implemented.\r\nApart from this, there is the basic but rather obvious\r\nfact that the membership of the United Nations has risen\r\nfrom 113 in 1965, when the present composition of the\r\nCouncil took effect, to 184 in 1994. The need to increase\r\nthe membership of the Council has received near\r\nuniversal acceptance.\r\nThe report of the Council in document A/49/2 is a\r\nhighly detailed compilation of decisions, resolutions and\r\ncommunications. It provides much useful documentary\r\nmaterial. As Sir David Hannay himself said:\r\n“... in conjunction with other official documents of\r\nthe Council ... it constitutes a reference guide.”\r\n(supra, p. 2)\r\nIf nothing else, it illustrates the extent of the Security\r\nCouncil’s range of activity, which has obviously been\r\nmatched by a correspondingly wide interest in its work.\r\nThe report also briefly — all too briefly — refers in\r\nChapter 28 to certain innovative procedures and working\r\nmethods followed by the Council in recent months,\r\nparticularly to increase transparency to enable\r\nnon-members of the Security Council to have a fuller\r\ninsight into its decision-making rationale. These need now\r\nto be formalized. The Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nSecurity Council has also discussed vital issues relating to\r\nneeded increases in the Council’s membership.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nThe report of the Security Council covers a 12-month\r\nperiod ending 15 June 1994. Discussions in the Working\r\nGroup on the Security Council continued well beyond this\r\ndate, its report being adopted only on 14 September 1994.\r\nFor this reason, it may not have been possible for the\r\nSecurity Council to comment in its report on the\r\nconclusions of the Working Group. It could also be argued\r\nthat the Security Council report is primarily meant to cover\r\ndecisions which have been taken within its own Chamber.\r\nYet, in the view of my delegation, it would be particularly\r\nappropriate if the Council found it possible in future reports\r\nto take cognizance of the considered views of the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations, including the permanent\r\nmembers of the Council.\r\nRelated to the Council’s report is another matter.\r\nResolution 48/264, in its operative paragraph 4,\r\n“Invites the President of the General Assembly,\r\nfollowing consultations, to propose appropriate ways\r\nand means to facilitate an in-depth discussion by the\r\nAssembly of matters contained in the reports\r\nsubmitted to it by the Security Council.”\r\nThis resolution was adopted by consensus after long\r\nand difficult negotiations on the revitalization of the work\r\nof the General Assembly. We hope that the President of the\r\nAssembly will initiate consultations on this subject within\r\nthe framework of the present agenda item, so that the\r\nAssembly can hold a constructive discussion on matters\r\ndealt with in the report submitted by the Council. We\r\nwould suggest, as the Chairman of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement did, that this item — item ll — be kept open to\r\npermit such consultations.\r\nMy delegation is certain that the Security Council\r\nwould see the interest displayed in its report as being\r\nmotivated by factors other than purely academic curiosity.\r\nWe believe the Security Council should encourage, not\r\ndisparage, this healthy interest in its work and provide in its\r\nfuture reports “a clear and informative account of its work”\r\n(resolution 48/264, para.3) to the fullest extent consistent\r\nwith the Charter which, it bears repetition, has enjoined the\r\nCouncil to act on behalf of the entire membership of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform delegations\r\nthat the Assembly will consider agenda item 39, “The\r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina”, on Thursday,\r\n3 November 1994 in the morning, instead of on\r\nWednesday, 2 November 1994 as previously scheduled.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/49/2)\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil): The delegation of Brazil\r\nwishes to express its appreciation to Sir David Hannay,\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of\r\nOctober, for having introduced the report of the Security\r\nCouncil (A/49/2) to the General Assembly, covering the\r\nperiod from 16 June 1993 to 15 June 1994.\r\nIt is very gratifying for the delegation of Brazil to\r\nnote that the practice which was inaugurated last year,\r\nwhen we were occupying the presidency of the Council\r\nfor the same month, has been aptly continued by the\r\ndelegation of the United Kingdom this year. We thank the\r\nPresident of the Council for the kind references he made\r\nto the initiative of my delegation and to myself. Likewise,\r\nI wish to thank other speakers who made similar\r\nreferences. It is our expectation that such a practice will\r\nbe maintained and further improved in the coming years.\r\nThe submission of the annual report by the Security\r\nCouncil in accordance with Article 24, paragraph 3, of the\r\nCharter and its consideration by the General Assembly, in\r\npursuance of Article 15, paragraph 1, represent a\r\nfundamental constitutional requirement enshrined in the\r\nCharter, which provides a privileged occasion for a\r\ncomprehensive and in-depth dialogue between these two\r\ncrucially important organs of our Organization.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the call made in his\r\nintroductory remarks by the President of the Council for\r\n“a substantive dialogue and interaction between\r\nthese two principal organs of the United Nations, a\r\ndialogue which will, I hope, touch not just on the\r\nnature of the report presented to the Assembly\r\ntoday, but also on the substance of the issues before\r\nthe Security Council”. (cf. supra., p. 1)\r\nIt was precisely this very objective that inspired my\r\ndelegation to introduce the report last year. In answer to\r\nthis call, my delegation will gladly address today both the\r\nformal and the substantive aspects of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nWith regard to the format of the report, the delegation\r\nof Brazil has always underscored the need to make the\r\npaperwork and procedures of the Council less opaque and\r\nmore user-friendly vis-à-vis the membership at large of the\r\nOrganization. In line with these concerns, during its\r\nmandate in the Council for the biennium 1993-1994, Brazil\r\nhas been actively participating in the Informal Working\r\nGroup on Documentation and Other Procedural Matters,\r\nwhose efforts were instrumental in improving some of the\r\nworking methods of the Council, and which have been\r\nreferred to both in the statement made by the President of\r\nthe Council and in the introduction of the report. We note\r\nwith satisfaction that, as another step in enhancing the flow\r\nof communication between the Council and the General\r\nAssembly, the President of the Council started the practice\r\nof regularly briefing orally non-member delegations at a\r\npre-arranged time and place. My delegation welcomes these\r\nimprovements and encourages the Working Group earnestly\r\nto continue its endeavours to further make the\r\ndocumentation and procedures of the Council more\r\ntransparent to the membership of the Organization.\r\nWhile taking note of the disclaimer that the Security\r\nCouncil’s report is not intended as a substitute for the\r\nofficial records of the Council, and that it rather constitutes\r\na reference guide to its work, we cannot fail to underline its\r\nfundamental deficiency, namely that it only reports on the\r\nofficial proceedings of that body. In this connection, we\r\npoint out that the introduction of the report mentions, for\r\nthe first time, the frequency of informal consultations\r\nduring the period, noting that the Council held 153 formal\r\nmeetings, adopted 87 resolutions and issued 68 presidential\r\nstatements, as against 252 informal consultations totalling\r\nsome 353 hours of deliberations.\r\nWhile this first and timid acknowledgement of the\r\nexistence of informal consultations is a positive sign, it\r\nhighlights a paradox — namely, that the report of the\r\nSecurity Council dedicates more than 500 pages to\r\ndescribing official proceedings, a great part of which is\r\nconstituted by formal and formalized meetings lasting no\r\nmore than five minutes each, whereas no indication is given\r\nabout the contents of the 353 hours dedicated to\r\n252 informal consultations, during which most of the truly\r\nsubstantive discussions were conducted. We therefore\r\nconsider it essential that some appropriate format be\r\ndevised to reflect the contents of the informal consultations\r\nin the Council’s report in order to preserve the substance of\r\nthese deliberations in some authoritative form.\r\nMy delegation is not oblivious to the need for a\r\ncertain degree of confidentiality and informality in the\r\ndeliberations of the Council in order to expedite its\r\nproceedings. However, recourse to such methods should\r\nbe had with due criteria and not pushed to such extremes\r\nthat could compromise the accountability and legitimacy\r\nof the Council vis-à-vis the membership of the\r\nOrganization, on whose behalf it bears the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nMore transparency does not necessarily mean less\r\nefficiency. While a smaller decision-making circle could\r\nperhaps arrive at conclusions more rapidly than a wider\r\ncollegiate, hastily taken decisions do not necessarily\r\ntranslate into effective results. The responses to the\r\ncomplex challenges currently before the Council should\r\nbe based on careful assessments and balanced measures.\r\nWith the demise of the period of automatic alignments\r\nwithin and without the Council, different perspectives and\r\ncontributions should be properly taken into account in the\r\ndeliberations of the Council if it is to attain fair and\r\nlasting solutions.\r\nThe views of my delegation concerning ways and\r\nmeans to improve the reporting system of the Security\r\nCouncil have been presented on many previous occasions,\r\nin particular in our statement during the debate on agenda\r\nitem 33. We intend to continue contributing to the\r\nimprovement of the working methods of the Council, both\r\nhere in the General Assembly and in the Security Council\r\nduring our remaining period in that organ.\r\nHaving been elected during the forty-seventh session\r\nof the General Assembly to occupy one of the\r\nnon-permanent seats of the Security Council for the\r\nperiod 1993 to 1994, Brazil has endeavoured to respond\r\nto the confidence bestowed by the international\r\ncommunity. Our positions on the issues before the\r\nCouncil have been founded on respect for the principle of\r\nnon-intervention, the upholding of the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of States, the permanent search for the\r\npeaceful and negotiated settlement of disputes, the\r\nprevalence of the rule of law in the international public\r\norder, the observance of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, and active contribution to peace-keeping\r\noperations and other relevant activities of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe have endeavoured to participate constructively in\r\nthe deliberations of more than 20 situations placed before\r\nthe Council during the period covered by this report.\r\nMoreover, our participation in the work of the subsidiary\r\nbodies, in particular the sanctions committees, was guided\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nby a concern firmly to implement the relevant resolutions\r\nand decisions of the Council, without losing sight of the\r\nneed to avoid unduly aggravating the situation of vulnerable\r\npopulations and innocent third countries. We point out, in\r\nthis regard, that the Committee on Yugoslavia alone, which\r\nis presided over by Brazil, has had to deal with more than\r\n34,000 communications in 1993 and more than\r\n45,000 communications so far in 1994, as reported by the\r\nSecretary-General in his annual report on the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn the field of peace-keeping, we have participated in\r\nthe activities of the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nEl Salvador, the United Nations Angola Verification\r\nMission, the United Nations Operation in Mozambique, the\r\nUnited Nations Protection Force and the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in Uganda-Rwanda, and we are actively\r\nconsidering further participation in other operations. We\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the\r\nselflessly dedicated and courageous personnel participating\r\nin the numerous peace-keeping operations of the\r\nOrganization, many of them operating under extremely\r\ndifficult and dangerous conditions.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation believes that the growing\r\nnumber and complexity of peace-keeping operations has\r\nmade imperative a thorough rethinking on the principles\r\nand practices observed by the United Nations in this field.\r\nI point out, for instance, that while the Security Council is\r\nthe organ competent for establishing such operations the\r\ngreat majority of Member States whose personnel take part\r\nin them are not represented on the Council. Moreover, the\r\nmandates set for many of these complex operations,\r\ninvolving a delicate imbrication of peace-keeping activities\r\nwith humanitarian, electoral and development assistance,\r\nneed to be more carefully considered by all parties\r\nconcerned. This is undoubtedly a crucial area in which\r\nsubstantive dialogue and close interaction between the\r\nSecurity Council and Member States are required. We note\r\nwith satisfaction that this month, at the initiative of the\r\ndelegations of Argentina and New Zealand, the Council has\r\nconsidered useful steps to improve consultations between\r\ntroop-contributing countries, members of the Security\r\nCouncil and the Secretariat. It is the expectation of my\r\ndelegation that these steps will be implemented soon and\r\nfurther improved as necessary, and we stand ready to\r\ncontinue to cooperate in this regard.\r\nWithout addressing each of the situations contained in\r\nthe Council’s report, I should like to underscore some of\r\nthe concerns that have guided our delegation during the\r\ndeliberations in which it has participated.\r\nFirst, my delegation has always advocated the need\r\nfor the Council to explore all possible avenues for\r\nnegotiation before resorting to enforcement actions under\r\nChapter VII. By their exceptional nature, these\r\nenforcement actions should be used only in extreme cases\r\nand cannot constitute a precedent for any other situation.\r\nAt the same time, when issuing warnings to parties in\r\nconflict, the Council should exercise utmost restraint in\r\nemploying language making implicit or explicit reference\r\nto coercive measures of dubious effectiveness. We would\r\nrather prefer to see the Council making fuller use of its\r\ndiplomatic tools, such as special missions, rapporteurs and\r\nother creative measures, in order to play a more proactive\r\nrole alongside the mediation activities of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nSecondly, we continue to hold that the authority of\r\nthe Security Council is not self-constituted. It originates\r\nfrom a delegation of powers conferred to it by the whole\r\nmembership of the Organization, in accordance with\r\nparagraph 1 of Article 24 of the Charter, as has been\r\nmentioned several times during this debate. For this\r\nreason, its powers and responsibilities under the Charter\r\nshould be strictly construed and cannot be created,\r\nrecreated or reinterpreted, creatively or otherwise, by\r\ndecisions of the Council itself. The competence of the\r\nCouncil should not be extended to matters not directly\r\nlinked to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, in particular when it involves legal and judicial\r\nprinciples. Not being a judicial organ, there is no way the\r\nCouncil could claim a jurisprudence or a system of\r\nprecedents for its decisions. It is our considered view that\r\nthe Security Council should not invoke Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter to take decisions in matters that would amount to\r\namending the Charter itself by extending its field of\r\ncompetence.\r\nThirdly, we firmly hold that all decisions and\r\nresolutions of the Council must be strictly complied with\r\nby all parties and by the Council itself. The Council\r\nshould not allow selective implementation of its\r\nresolutions nor adopt decisions only on selected situations.\r\nIt should demand full compliance with the terms of its\r\nrelevant resolutions as well as undertake to fulfil promptly\r\nits own obligations under these resolutions. Above all, for\r\nthe sake of its credibility, the Council should refrain from\r\nreinterpreting its own terms at different moments at its\r\nconvenience.\r\nFourthly, the Council should avoid the proliferation\r\nof instances in which it delegates enforcement actions to\r\nthird parties without clear mechanisms for the control of\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nand accountability for such actions. Cooperation,\r\ncoordination and other arrangements with relevant regional\r\norganizations are to be encouraged, but they cannot\r\nconstitute a substitute for the fulfilment of the Council’s\r\nown primary responsibility in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security in accordance with the\r\nCharter.\r\nLast but not least, the Council must act and be seen as\r\nacting impartially in the performance of its responsibilities.\r\nIt should be ready to take measures against parties that fail\r\nto comply with its resolutions and to support those who\r\ncomply. In particular, it should avoid a purportedly\r\nbalanced approach that would eventually only favour those\r\nwho seek to postpone the fulfilment of their obligations.\r\nThese were some, though not all, of the main\r\nconsiderations that guided my delegation in addressing the\r\ndifferent situations described in the report of the Security\r\nCouncil, and we hope this will clarify for the Members of\r\nthe Organization the positions adopted by Brazil.\r\nIn closing, my delegation would like to underscore\r\nonce again the critical importance of substantive dialogue\r\nand interaction between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Such exercise should not be restricted\r\nto the occasion of the formal consideration by the General\r\nAssembly of the Security Council’s annual report but\r\nshould be an ongoing, in-depth exercise stemming from the\r\nconstitutional responsibilities of these two organs in\r\npursuance of their respective functions and powers as\r\nenshrined in the Charter.\r\nIn January 1995, there will be a second Summit-level\r\nmeeting of the Security Council to review the international\r\nsituation from the perspective of its competence. In October\r\n1995, there will be a Summit meeting of all States\r\nMembers of the Organization to assess the realization of the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations throughout its\r\n50 years of activity. It is our expectation that these\r\noccasions will create further momentum for the\r\nintensification of the dialogue and interaction between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, with a view to\r\nstrengthening the Organization as a whole for the benefit of\r\nall its Member States.\r\nMr. Mumbengegwi (Zimbabwe): Let me at the outset\r\nlend my delegation’s support to the statement delivered by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Indonesia on behalf of the\r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nThe report before us in document A/49/2 is prepared\r\nin accordance with Article 15, paragraph 1, and Article\r\n24, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nParagraph 1 of Article 15 provides that the General\r\nAssembly shall receive and consider annual and special\r\nreports from the Security Council; these reports shall\r\ninclude an account of the measures that the Security\r\nCouncil has decided upon or taken to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security. Paragraph 3 of Article 24\r\nprovides that the Security Council shall submit annual\r\nand, when necessary, special reports to the General\r\nAssembly for its consideration.\r\nClearly, the intention in the Charter of our\r\nOrganization is that the Security Council should be fully\r\naccountable to the General Assembly through annual\r\nreports or, where necessary, through special reports. In\r\nfact, paragraph 1 of Article 24 of the Charter makes it\r\nabundantly clear that the general membership confers on\r\nthe Security Council primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security “in order\r\nto ensure prompt and effective action by the United\r\nNations”. Thus, in carrying out its duties under this\r\nresponsibility, the Security Council acts on behalf of the\r\ngeneral membership.\r\nThe mandate is clearly given to the Security Council\r\nunder the Charter solely in order to ensure prompt and\r\neffective action by the United Nations. The authors of the\r\nCharter correctly recognized that urgent matters of\r\ninternational peace and security could not be\r\nexpeditiously dealt with by a large and universal body\r\nsuch as this General Assembly. Thus the annual and\r\nspecial reports of the Security Council were meant to give\r\nthe General Assembly the opportunity to assess and\r\nevaluate the work of the Security Council and provide\r\nguidance as might be required.\r\nRegrettably, the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly remains a compendium of documents\r\nand resolutions that have passed through the Security\r\nCouncil. It is completely lacking in transparency and\r\ntotally devoid of analysis. This report, as those who have\r\nspoken before me have also indicated, can be of use only\r\nto historians, librarians, archivists and academic\r\nresearchers, and certainly not to this General Assembly.\r\nThe format and content of this report might have\r\nmade sense during the cold war years, when it was\r\ndifficult for the Security Council to agree on anything of\r\nsubstance and in some cases even of procedure. However,\r\nwe now have to accept that in this post-cold- war era,\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nwhere it is now possible for the Security Council to reach\r\nconsensus on a wide range of issues, the report before us is\r\nnot only anachronistic but also an unacceptable relic of the\r\npast.\r\nA report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly should, in our view, contain a background of the\r\nissues on which the Security Council has deliberated; a\r\nrecord of developments on each of these issues as they\r\nunfolded; the nature of the informal deliberations of the\r\nCouncil; and the reasons behind each decision that the\r\nCouncil took. We know that all too often Security Council\r\ndecisions are arrived at through informal consultations\r\namong Council members, from which the general\r\nmembership, on whose behalf the Security Council acts, is\r\nbarred. It is therefore most disappointing to receive, year\r\nafter year, a report that fails to shed any light on the basis\r\nof action of the Security Council.\r\nThe format and content of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly underline the urgent need\r\nfor the reform and restructuring of the Security Council so\r\nas to ensure equality and democracy in its composition,\r\nprocedures and practices. Its decision-making process must\r\ndisplay greater transparency through wider participation of\r\nthe general membership both in informal consultations and\r\nat formal meetings. We believe that once this shroud of\r\nsecrecy is lifted from the work of the Security Council it\r\nwill be much easier for the Council to present to the\r\nGeneral Assembly the report expected under the Charter,\r\nwhich underlines the accountability of the Security Council\r\nto the general membership.\r\nWe note with concern that some of the provisions of\r\nArticle 15, paragraph 1, remain a dead letter. In accordance\r\nwith that Article, the Security Council should submit, in\r\naddition to the annual report, special reports on issues\r\naffecting international peace and security. I cannot recall\r\nthat in the years I have represented Zimbabwe here at the\r\nUnited Nations there has been a single special report on\r\nissues affecting international peace and security; yet there\r\nhave been numerous upheavals and crises in various parts\r\nof the world during this period.\r\nPerhaps if the Security Council had provided the\r\nGeneral Assembly with a special report on Rwanda before\r\nthe events of April this year, collaboration between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council might have\r\naverted a tragedy of the magnitude we subsequently\r\nwitnessed. My delegation was appalled by the manner in\r\nwhich the Security Council handled the question of\r\nRwanda, and it believes that the Security Council’s\r\napparent selectivity and double standards in addressing\r\nthe various issues on its agenda should be avoided in the\r\nfuture. Indeed, there could well have been compelling\r\nreasons for the Council to act as it did; if so, one would\r\nexpect a full account in the annual report so that the\r\nAssembly could try to find ways and means of avoiding\r\nsimilar catastrophes in future. Regrettably, after reading\r\nthe report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly we are no wiser.\r\nThe General Assembly must commend the Security\r\nCouncil on the tenacity it has displayed in dealing with\r\nthe intractable problems of the former Yugoslavia.\r\nDespite the many setbacks and the complexity of this\r\nconflict as well as the continued lack of agreement among\r\nthe parties, the Security Council has not thrown up its\r\nhands in despair, nor has it threatened to leave the parties\r\nto consume themselves in internecine civil war. We know\r\nthat the achievement of peace requires patience, resources\r\nand an unwavering will on the part of our Organization.\r\nIn this regard, it is of great concern that the Security\r\nCouncil does not seem to have applied itself with the\r\nsame tenacity, unwavering will or generosity with peace-\r\nkeeping resources with regard to the conflicts in Angola,\r\nSomalia, Liberia and Rwanda. It appears that in regard to\r\nthose conflicts resolutions emanating from the Council\r\nconstantly threaten the imminent withdrawal of\r\ninternational assistance. The general membership expects\r\nexplanations from the Security Council. Where would one\r\nexpect to find them if not in the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the general membership? Regrettably,\r\nafter reading the report we are no wiser.\r\nMy delegation would like to underline, as others\r\nhave done, that it is better to commit scarce resources to\r\npreventing conflicts or addressing them in their infancy\r\nthan to be compelled to do so when they have reached\r\ncatastrophic proportions, when even greater resources are\r\ninvariably required.\r\nMr. Laclaustra (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Security Council is today submitting to the\r\nGeneral Assembly the report on its work from 16 June\r\n1993 to 15 June 1994. This report was adopted by the\r\nCouncil on 18 October last. The President of the Security\r\nCouncil, Sir David Hannay, has introduced the report on\r\nbehalf of the members of the Council and has pointed out\r\nsome innovations that were made in drafting it. In our\r\nview, these innovations have contributed to improving and\r\nenhancing the text.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nIn this year’s consideration of the report we are\r\ncontinuing the process, embarked on last year, of making\r\nimprovements in the drafting and publication of the report\r\nwith a view to enhancing the transparency of the Council’s\r\nactivities and the level of awareness of those activities by\r\nMembers of the Organization.\r\nIn this regard, the Working Group on documentation\r\nand other procedural questions, a subsidiary body of the\r\nCouncil which was established in June 1993 and which has\r\nbeen meeting regularly since then, has played a very\r\npositive role, in conjunction with the Secretariat, whose\r\nconcrete effect can be seen in this year’s report.\r\nLast year we endorsed the expansion of the descriptive\r\ncontent of the introduction to the report. Now we have\r\nobserved further improvements in the same direction which\r\nshould make it easier to study the report on the Council’s\r\nwork. I am referring to accounts of the formal meetings of\r\nthe Council, systematically grouped by agenda items,\r\ntogether with resolutions and statements adopted with\r\nrespect to these items, as well as the inclusion of\r\ninformation on the activities of the Council’s subsidiary\r\nbodies.\r\nAlso included, as appendices to the report, are\r\ncommunications by the Secretary-General and the President\r\nof the Security Council, as well as reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral issued during the period under consideration.\r\nIn addition, the rationalization of the Council’s agenda\r\nhas continued. The list of issues submitted to the Council\r\ncontained 215 items on 15 June 1993 as opposed to 150 on\r\n15 June 1994, even though the Council had to address 17\r\nnew items during that period.\r\nIt is only fair to acknowledge the improvements I have\r\nmentioned, which offer genuine grounds for satisfaction.\r\nHowever, the Council is aware that there is a need to\r\ncontinue working to ensure that these innovations and\r\nimprovements become more substantive.\r\nIt is clear that from a procedural standpoint the formal\r\nmeetings of the Council are the place and the occasion for\r\nthe production of its records, in the context of its mandate\r\nof peace-keeping and maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. At the same time, we must acknowledge that\r\nthe Council does a great deal of its work in informal\r\nconsultations. In fact, matters of great practical importance,\r\nsuch as the review of the various sanctions regimes\r\nimposed under Chapter VII of the Charter, are not the\r\nsubject of a formal decision by the Council when the\r\nresult of those deliberations involves no change in them.\r\nIt would therefore be appropriate — in terms of both\r\nthe transparency and the faithful, realistic description of\r\nthe Council’s work — to speak in the report, at least in\r\nstatistical terms, of the Council’s informal consultations\r\nand the items discussed in them. This would add nothing\r\nthat could give rise to misinterpretation, as the agenda of\r\ninformal consultations is set out daily in the Journal of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThus far we have been speaking of a report on the\r\nwork of the Security Council. It includes descriptions of\r\nrecords, of the Council’s meetings, of the communications\r\nsent to or by the Council, and of the items of which it is\r\nseized. One might consider how the Council could put\r\nthis information together in analytical form and convey to\r\nthe General Assembly its assessment of its own work.\r\nThis would have two advantages. It would enhance the\r\nquality, not just the quantity, of the information provided\r\nby the Council, and it would yield a sort of authoritative\r\ninterpretation of the Council’s activities by the very body\r\nthat carried them out. Thus, other interpretations would\r\nhave to use the Council’s own assessment as a point of\r\nreference, which would limit biased perceptions at\r\nvariance with the actual work of the Council.\r\nThose issues are part of a broader debate aimed at\r\nenabling all Members of the United Nations — on whose\r\nbehalf, under the terms of Article 24 of the Charter, the\r\nCouncil acts — to participate more in the work of the\r\nCouncil. Specifically, it is a question of broadening the\r\nmachinery and procedures for consultations to take into\r\naccount the views of States contributing to peace-keeping\r\noperations in situations that affect them directly, as those\r\nviews are a most important part of the very conception of\r\nan operation. The Security Council is currently\r\nconsidering this question on the basis of the proposal\r\nsubmitted by the delegations of Argentina and New\r\nZealand; in the view of the Spanish delegation, this is of\r\nthe greatest interest.\r\nMoreover, last week the President of the Security\r\nCouncil began the practice of reporting weekly to\r\nMembers of the Organization on the Council’s informal\r\nconsultations on the matters before it. We view this as a\r\npositive step, and consider that the Working Group on\r\nDocumentation and Procedural Matters could continue its\r\nconsideration of the quantitative and qualitative\r\naugmentation of the flow of information to Member\r\nStates not members of the Security Council.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nThe Council has considerably expanded its activities\r\nin recent years, addressing issues that increasingly affect all\r\nStates Members of the Organization. Increasing the degree\r\nto which non-members are informed about and participate\r\nin the Council’s decisions would only bolster the legitimacy\r\nof those decisions and improve the prospects of their\r\nimplementation. During its term as a member of the\r\nCouncil over the past 22 months, Spain has tried to make\r\na constructive contribution to that end, and will continue to\r\ndo so until the end of its tenure.\r\nMr. Bagatsing (Philippines): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation joins other delegations in thanking the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, in his capacity as\r\nPresident of the Security Council, for introducing the\r\nannual report of the Council and for presenting the various\r\nmeasures the Council has taken to make its work more\r\ntransparent and accessible to non-members.\r\nMy delegation received the latest annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly just in time for\r\nthis debate, and we thank the members of the Council for\r\ntheir efforts. Nevertheless, the situation would have been\r\nmuch more encouraging if the report had been received\r\nearlier so that delegations and the General Assembly could\r\nhave had more time to consider its substance and content\r\nand adequately prepare for the debate.\r\nMore important, however, in paragraph 4 of its\r\nresolution 48/264, the General Assembly invites the\r\nPresident of the Assembly to propose appropriate ways and\r\nmeans to facilitate an in-depth discussion by the Assembly\r\nof matters contained in the reports submitted to it by the\r\nCouncil. This would be particularly relevant in the case of\r\nthe annual report. We therefore urge the President to\r\nundertake such consultations with delegations at the earliest\r\npossible date with a view to enabling the General\r\nAssembly, in line with resolution 48/264, to conduct such\r\nan in-depth discussion on matters contained in the report,\r\nparticularly on those of an urgent character or those\r\ncommanding wide or general interest. It is particularly for\r\nthis reason that we fully support the proposal to keep this\r\nitem open after today’s debate.\r\nAs it stands now, even if we desired to conduct either\r\na meaningful exchange of views or the in-depth discussion\r\ncalled for in resolution 48/264, the present organizational\r\nset-up for our debate is not conducive to such discussion\r\nand does not provide sufficient time for it. We believe that\r\na more appropriate mechanism should be established, to\r\ngive delegations and the General Assembly sufficient time\r\nto express their views on the matters in the report and,\r\nwhere appropriate, to translate them into\r\nrecommendations.\r\nThe format for considering the report is one aspect\r\nof this issue. The other pertains to its content. Although\r\nwe welcome the recent efforts of the Council to improve\r\nthe presentation of its annual report, we believe that the\r\npossibility of having a substantive debate on the report\r\nwould be considerably enhanced and facilitated if certain\r\nimprovements in content and presentation were made by\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nIn this regard, in paragraph 3 of resolution 48/264,\r\nthe General Assembly encourages the Council, in its\r\nsubmission of reports to the Assembly, to provide a clear\r\nand informative account of its work. We believe that this\r\ncould be accomplished by presenting a more substantive\r\nand explanatory annual report, and not just what is\r\nessentially a compilation of official proceedings and\r\ndecisions. In other words, the report should include,\r\namong other things, and in an appropriate format, the\r\nsubstance or a summary of the closed informal\r\nconsultations of the whole on the key matters covered in\r\nthe report, especially those informal consultations of the\r\nwhole which led to the adoption of a decision or course\r\nof action on those key matters.\r\nWhat is most important in this matter would be\r\ninformation on the reasons why and the circumstances\r\nunder which a particular issue was placed on the\r\nCouncil’s agenda, and the elements or factors which led\r\nto a specific course of action on that issue. This would, in\r\nour view, enable the General Assembly and the\r\nmembership at large to conduct a more meaningful\r\nexchange of views on the issues in the report, as a clearer\r\nappreciation would be gained of the Council’s\r\ndeliberations and of the thinking of its members which\r\nled to decisions or actions on these critical issues.\r\nWe also believe that the annual report could include\r\na section containing an outline or preliminary forecast of\r\nthe annual work programme of the Council, particularly\r\non issues identified in the current report as requiring the\r\nCouncil’s continued debate or further action.\r\nThe period covered should also be timely, as stated\r\nin resolution 48/264. Current and urgent issues should be\r\nparticularly highlighted so that the Assembly could, if it\r\ndesires, focus its discussions on matters under\r\nconsideration by the Council.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nThe Council should also seriously consider providing\r\nmore frequent special reports to the General Assembly in\r\naccordance with Article 15 of the Charter. This would,\r\namong other things, provide the General Assembly with a\r\ncontinuous, up-to-date and authoritative source of\r\ninformation on the Security Council’s decisions and\r\nactivities, and would facilitate any debate on them.\r\nFinally, we look forward to having in the near future\r\na truly substantive debate on the issues in the Council’s\r\nannual report, as envisioned in resolution 48/264, not only\r\nas a means of revitalizing debate on this item but also as a\r\nconvincing manifestation of the accountability of the\r\nSecurity Council to the general membership, as set forth in\r\nthe Charter.\r\nMr. Azwai (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)(interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): The annual report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly was the subject of considerable\r\ncriticism at the last two sessions. This criticism stemmed\r\nfrom the fact that the report is a copy of already known\r\nresolutions and decisions and is merely a narrative, one that\r\ndoes not deal with a considerable part of the Council’s\r\nwork.\r\nWith the aim of reforming the working methods and\r\nprocedures of the Council, many proposals have been put\r\nforward. Today, as the General Assembly examines the\r\nCouncil’s report to this session, we note that the Council\r\nhas paid some attention to such proposals. However, we\r\nstill find that what has been done does not rise to the level\r\nof expectations of the Member States. My country’s\r\ndelegation wishes to stress the need for the Council to carry\r\nout all the proposed reforms, and the need for its reports to\r\nbe substantive and to respond fully to all that has been\r\ncalled for by Member States as clearly set forth in General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/264.\r\nThe submission by the Security Council of its annual\r\nreport to the General Assembly is stipulated by Article 24\r\nof the Charter, with the aim of enabling the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, which agreed that the Security Council\r\nshould act on their behalf, to consider the report, to study\r\nit and to make whatever comments they may deem proper.\r\nThe aim of that provision is also to enable the Member\r\nStates to ascertain whether or not the Security Council, in\r\ncarrying out its functions, strictly acts within its competence\r\nunder the Charter and whether or not, when dealing with\r\ninternational questions, it takes into consideration the views\r\nand positions of the Member States.\r\nAs in the past, the Security Council report to the\r\npresent session, which is now before us in document\r\nA/49/2, contains all the resolutions, decisions, and\r\nstatements adopted by the Council in the course of the\r\nyear. Nevertheless, the report is neither comprehensive\r\nnor detailed. It does not show, even in brief terms, the\r\nmotives underlying those decisions and resolutions and\r\ndoes not make clear how they were arrived at, particularly\r\nthose resolutions adopted under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter, which originate from the wishes of certain\r\nStates — especially the United States of America - which\r\nwould exploit the Council to serve their own aims and\r\npurposes. In order for future reports to be comprehensive\r\nand to truly reflect all the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil, my country’s delegation believes that the\r\nCouncil should remedy all these lacunae.\r\nIn addition, the report should set forth in detail the\r\nresults of the work of the Council’s subsidiary bodies and\r\nshould set forth the discussions that take place in its\r\ninformal consultations, since we assume that the Council\r\nhas nothing to hide with regard to what takes place in\r\nsuch consultations. If such is indeed the case, then the\r\nSecurity Council’s report should contain what goes on in\r\nthose informal consultations. Furthermore, such informal\r\nconsultations should not be the rule but the limited\r\nexception in order for the Council to revert to the\r\nfundamental rule of its work, namely, more formal and\r\nopen meetings. That would enable Member States to\r\nmake clear their positions on matters before the Council\r\nprior to and not after the start of the decision-making\r\nprocess, as is the current practice, so that the Member\r\nStates will not continue to face a fait accompli over\r\nwhich their views have no influence whatever.\r\nThe end of the cold war ushered in a new era of\r\ncooperation in the international arena, which aims, inter\r\nalia, at better balance between the activities of the organs\r\nof the United Nations and at ensuring that those organs,\r\nespecially the Security Council, should exercise their\r\nfunctions in a democratic fashion within the competence\r\nset forth in the Charter, without any hegemony or\r\ninfluence by any State. Although these demands have\r\nbeen repeated and reconfirmed on many occasions in\r\nmany forums — including the General Assembly, which\r\nexpresses the will of all Member States — we are\r\nconcerned that some Security Council actions show that\r\nit has observed neither those demands nor the terms of its\r\nown competence. A look at the Council’s activities during\r\nthe period covered by its current report reveals that the\r\nCouncil has increasingly tended to encroach on the\r\nfunctions of other United Nations organs. This is an\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nunacceptable tendency, because it is unacceptable for the\r\nSecurity Council to use the definition of what constitutes a\r\nthreat to international peace and security as a pretext for\r\nencroaching on the competence of other bodies, as is the\r\ncase with regard to human-rights issues.\r\nIt is also untenable for the Council to act in haste or\r\nto continue to adopt resolutions on questions that are still\r\nbeing considered by other United Nations bodies. As a case\r\nin point, we must mention what has come to be known as\r\nthe Lockerbie problem, which is still before the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. The International Court has\r\nyet to rule on the problem. Libya has had recourse to the\r\nCourt as the question is purely legal, and not political,\r\ncontrary to the United States insistence and its forcing the\r\nSecurity Council to accept that view. The United States has\r\npressured the Council into adopting resolutions against\r\nLibya which, to say the least, are arbitrary, unjust, run\r\ncounter to the Charter of the United Nations and are in\r\nflagrant breach of international law and international\r\nconventions, in particular, the Montreal Convention, which\r\nis the only instrument dealing with questions of\r\ninternational civil aviation and whose provisions are quite\r\nclear.\r\nTo add insult to injury, the United States of America\r\nhas insisted on dealing with the question under Chapter VII\r\nof the Charter, which concerns threats to international peace\r\nand security. My country finds it really strange to pick out\r\nChapter VII and apply it to this incident, which is nothing\r\nmore than a legal dispute, at a time when others who\r\nviolate and refuse to implement Security Council\r\nresolutions, and whose actions, to say the least, can be\r\nqualified as real threats to international peace and security,\r\nare exempt from the application of that Chapter. We are, of\r\ncourse, speaking here of the Israelis, who are exempt from\r\naction under Chapter VII because of the hegemony of the\r\nUnited States and its pursuance of a policy of double\r\nstandards with regard to the questions dealt with by the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWhile the Charter of the United Nations encourages\r\nthe settling of disputes by peaceful means, it is worth\r\nnoting that one of the resolutions mentioned in the Security\r\nCouncil’s report under review, namely resolution 883\r\n(l993), was adopted in continuation of a case that was dealt\r\nwith under Chapter VII of the Charter, before the\r\nmechanism provided for in Chapter VI had been properly\r\nused. It also bears noting that the rule of holding\r\nconsultations with the States concerned was not applied.\r\nWe know that in a specific case, namely the Lockerbie\r\nquestion, the Security Council ignored the need to engage\r\nin such consultations and turned a deaf ear to the views\r\nvoiced by my country and to the positions taken by\r\ninternational and regional organizations on how best to\r\ndeal with this question. As a result of the intransigence of\r\nthree of its permanent members, the Council had to deal\r\nwith this question through the imposition of coercive\r\nunjustified measures that run counter to many of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s resolutions, including resolution\r\n44/2l5, which calls for refraining from applying\r\nrestrictions, blockades and embargoes against developing\r\ncountries as a form of political and economic coercion\r\nthat affects their economic and social development and\r\naims at forcing such countries to change their internal and\r\nforeign policies in line with the wishes of major Powers\r\nthat would impose their tutelage on the world. My\r\ncountry’s position is that these dangerous trends should\r\nnot be ignored or acquiesced in.\r\nIt is imperative to stand up to attempts by certain\r\npermanent members of the Security Council to transform\r\nit into something like their own exclusive club, by\r\nexcluding other members and by conducting most of the\r\nCouncil’s business among themselves, with the aim of\r\nusing the Council to achieve their own political objectives\r\nthrough the obstruction of the settlement of disputes by\r\npeaceful means and by dealing with certain differences\r\nthrough the adoption of coercive measures.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation believes that there is an\r\nurgent need to reconsider the working methods of the\r\ncommittees established by the Security Council, especially\r\nthose established by means of resolutions adopted under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter, including the Committee\r\nestablished under resolution 748 (1992) which has\r\nbecome a Committee devoted to hurting and punishing\r\nthe Libyan people.\r\nAt a time when many Libyans are dying daily\r\nbecause of serious illnesses and road accidents, a member\r\nof the Committee, namely the delegation of the United\r\nStates of America, is reluctant even to respond to requests\r\nfor approval of organizing flying ambulances, which are\r\nexempted from the air embargo. That delegation uses the\r\ninnovation of the Committee’s taking decisions by\r\nconsensus to intentionally delay its replies to many\r\nmedical treatment requests, without giving any reasons.\r\nThis procrastination has deprived many Libyan intensive-\r\ncare patients of the chance of treatment abroad. As a\r\nmatter of fact, this new type of “veto” has caused the\r\ndeath of many patients, including two little girls, Rima\r\nSaleh Abdel Rahman and Safaa Ali Abdel Rasool, as well\r\nas other children, old men and pregnant women. In\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\naddition, it is really surprising that, through its\r\nprocrastination and delays in answering requests submitted\r\nto it for authorizing the arrangement of flights for Heads of\r\nState and Government who wish to visit the Jamahiriya\r\nusing their own private planes, the Committee is trying to\r\nimpose more restrictions on Libya and hamper its attempts\r\nat enhancing cooperation with other countries.\r\nIn discharging its main responsibilities in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, the Security Council\r\nshould neither set itself apart from the other bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations nor set itself above them as if it were\r\nsuperior to all those other United Nations bodies. The\r\nsound approach should be consonant with the fact that\r\nmembers of the Council, in exercising their functions, are\r\nexpected to transcend their national affiliations and keep in\r\nmind always that they act not only on behalf of the groups\r\nthey represent but also on behalf of the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole. In order for the members of the\r\nCouncil to guarantee that the resolutions it adopts and\r\nenumerates in its annual report truly reflect the collective\r\nwill of the international community, they should credibly\r\nmake sure that in its dealings, the Council applies the\r\nprinciples of the Charter consistently, not selectively, and\r\naddresses international problems fairly and objectively.\r\nThey should always keep in mind the statement of the\r\nSecretary-General in paragraph 82 of his report entitled “An\r\nAgenda for Peace” (A/47/277):\r\n“The principles of the Charter must be applied\r\nconsistently, not selectively, for if the perception\r\nshould be of the latter, trust will wane and with it the\r\nmoral authority which is the greatest and most unique\r\nquality of that instrument.”\r\nThe practices of the Security Council have in many\r\naspects been strange indeed. In our view, they do not really\r\nreflect the position of the Member States, on whose behalf\r\nthe Council acts. These are extremely dangerous precedents.\r\nThe crash of an American plane and the accusation that two\r\npeople from a certain country have something to do with\r\nthis crash has been referred to the Security Council, which\r\nis forced into considering the matter, though it has nothing\r\nwhatsoever to do with the Council’s mandate and functions,\r\nas we have already stated.\r\nIn addition, we see major Powers that are permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council and, as such, are supposed\r\nto bear more responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security pressurize the Council into\r\nviolating the Charter and infringing on the independence of\r\nthe country of the two suspects, asking that they be\r\nsurrendered to be tried before the courts of those Powers,\r\nwhich is a dangerous precedent that encroaches on the\r\nindependence of all small countries, not only Libya. In\r\naddition, pushing the Council into adopting a resolution\r\nto invade an independent country to restore to power a\r\ndeposed President under the pretext of protecting\r\ndemocracy is a very dangerous and unprecedented act, a\r\nflagrant intervention in the internal affairs of a State and\r\nan act of contempt for the freedom of peoples. Would the\r\nSecurity Council return every President deposed by his\r\npeople, anywhere in the world, or was it the emigration\r\nproblem that prompted the United States to use the\r\nSecurity Council and the United Nations as camouflage to\r\nstem this emigration by occupying its source?\r\nMy country wishes to alert all the countries of the\r\nworld gathered together here in this Hall to the grave\r\nnature of such practices. Unless the world stands up to\r\nsuch excesses, the major Powers, especially the United\r\nStates of America, will not hesitate to use the Security\r\nCouncil for realizing their own objectives, regardless of\r\nthe fact that this is bound to undermine trust in the United\r\nNations and its impartiality and steer it, sooner or later,\r\ntowards the fate of the League of Nations. This is a fate\r\nwe, the small peoples, do not wish for our world\r\nOrganization in which we have placed all our hopes for\r\nthe protection of our sovereignty and independence and\r\nfor preventing the powerful from preying on us while\r\nusing the United Nations as a cover for their excesses.\r\nMr. Khoshroo (Islamic Republic of Iran): My\r\ndelegation has reviewed the report (A/49/2) of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly covering the\r\nperiod from 16 June 1993 to 15 June 1994. It is a matter\r\nof regret that it took more than four months for the\r\nCouncil to adopt its report and present it to the General\r\nAssembly, leaving the entire membership only a few days\r\nto evaluate the way in which the Council handled its\r\nresponsibilities during the past year.\r\nAs a principal organ of the United Nations, entrusted\r\nwith the primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the Security Council\r\nshould act on behalf of Member States in carrying out its\r\nduties, as is provided for in the United Nations Charter.\r\nAs the Secretary-General stated in his report on the work\r\nof the Organization, the increased participation in the\r\nconsideration in the General Assembly of the item now\r\nbefore us proves that Member States are justifiably\r\ninterested in the work of the Security Council. The\r\nquestion of the Council’s accountability to the entire\r\nmembership is therefore the foremost element in the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nsmooth functioning of the Council. If the Council ignores\r\nthis very fact its credibility will face serious damage.\r\nMoreover, although the role and agenda of the Security\r\nCouncil have been expanded in the post-cold-war era, the\r\nCouncil needs to be more accountable to the general\r\nmembership.\r\nArticle 15 of the Charter gives the General Assembly\r\nthe responsibility of receiving and considering reports from\r\nthe Security Council. Moreover, Article 24 provides that the\r\nSecurity Council shall submit annual reports to the General\r\nAssembly for its consideration. Both Articles underline the\r\nimportance of the Security Council’s obligations in regard\r\nto proper submission of its reports. It is repeatedly\r\nemphasized by a great majority of Member States that the\r\nannual reports of the Security Council should be\r\ncharacterized by a comprehensive and integrated analysis of\r\nthe issues on its agenda and of the approaches that the\r\nCouncil adopts in addressing matters of substance.\r\nUnfortunately, the Council’s present report still lacks\r\nany explanation of its decisions and any assessment of its\r\nactions. Rather, it is a compilation of symbols, resolutions\r\nand chronologies of issues already available to Member\r\nStates, and omits the proceedings of the Council in informal\r\nconsultations, as well as of its subsidiary organs. Such\r\nreports cannot meet the minimum expectations of those\r\nMember States that are not represented in the Council. The\r\nsubmission of a report that fails to address matters of\r\nsubstance, together with the Council’s current practice of\r\nholding more closed meetings than formal meetings, has\r\naggravated the lack of transparency in its work. There is no\r\ndoubt that the introduction of transparency into the\r\nCouncil’s activities and democratization of its decision-\r\nmaking process would enhance the credibility of the United\r\nNations system as a whole. In fact, the Council should\r\nattempt to gain the confidence and trust of the general\r\nmembership so as to be able to act on its behalf. With\r\nregard to the convening of informal briefings by the\r\nPresident of the Council, my delegation hopes that these\r\nwill go beyond procedural matters and touch the substance\r\nof the issues being discussed in the Council.\r\nPrince Sisowath Sirirath (Cambodia), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nIt is important that any consideration of the work of\r\nthe Security Council include a review of the Council’s\r\napproach to threats to international peace and security.\r\nUnfortunately, the Council’s adoption of selective\r\napproaches and its application of double standards have not\r\nonly undermined its credibility, but have also prevented it\r\nfrom dealing effectively with clear cases of aggression.\r\nFurthermore, lack of political will on the part of some\r\nPowers has created situations in which the Council has\r\nbeen unable to implement its own resolutions.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to emphasize — as my\r\ndelegation has done previously — the importance of\r\nimplementing resolution 48/264 on the revitalization of\r\nthe work of the Assembly, in which, among other things,\r\nthe President of the General Assembly is invited to\r\npropose ways and means of facilitating an in-depth\r\ndiscussion by the Assembly of matters contained in the\r\nreports submitted to it by the Security Council. In this\r\ncontext, we firmly believe that consultations should be\r\nundertaken so as to continue consideration of this agenda\r\nitem.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria): Austria highly appreciates\r\nthe fact that this report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, like the last one, was introduced by\r\nthe Member State currently holding the presidency of the\r\nCouncil. This follow-up to the initiative taken by the\r\ndelegation of Brazil during its presidency in October 1993\r\nis a clear manifestation of the political will to enhance the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the\r\nmembership of the United Nations at large, pursuant to\r\nand in accordance with Article 24 of the Charter. By\r\npresenting the report, the President of the Security\r\nCouncil, on behalf of the Council’s members,\r\ndemonstrates awareness of the Council’s particular\r\nposition vis-à-vis the General Assembly, as well as\r\nreadiness to enter into a dialogue with the Assembly.\r\nThe work accomplished by the Security Council\r\nduring the period under consideration deserves high\r\nappreciation. The voluminous document in front of us\r\nspeaks for itself. The Security Council has become what\r\nthe founding fathers of this Organizations wanted it to\r\nbe — the cornerstone of all efforts to maintain and restore\r\ninternational peace and security. Heavy political demands\r\non the Council often lead to more and more resolutions,\r\ndeclarations or statements on issues before the Council,\r\nwhich then all too soon find their way into the archives\r\nwithout having had a real impact on political\r\ndevelopments. Thus — to sound a note of caution — a\r\nmore selective approach might enhance the authority of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nSecurity Council resolutions are effective only when\r\nthey gain political relevance outside this building, when\r\nparties to a conflict not only take note of them, but also\r\nabide by them — in short, when, through Security\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nCouncil decisions, concrete contributions can be made to\r\nfacilitate a political solution or to stabilize a volatile\r\nsituation.\r\nLegitimacy and representativeness are important values\r\nfor a Council acting on behalf of all States Members of the\r\nOrganization in carrying out its primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. These\r\nvalues call for increased interaction, wherever appropriate,\r\nbetween the Security Council and States that are not\r\nmembers of the Council. We listened with great interest to\r\nthe relevant remarks made today by the President of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn this context two main elements should be taken into\r\naccount.\r\nCertainly, in order to ensure the necessary privacy for\r\nconstructive discussions and negotiations, deliberations in\r\nclosed meetings will remain necessary. However, in the\r\ninterest both of the Security Council and of the entire\r\nmembership, a certain balance between privacy and\r\ntransparency has to be achieved in order to pave the way\r\nfor a possible feedback from the international community,\r\nas represented in the General Assembly, on the Security\r\nCouncil’s work.\r\nWe therefore welcome the recent steps taken by the\r\nCouncil towards better accessibility to information. In this\r\ncontext, we appreciate the initiative taken by the British\r\npresidency last week for briefings on a regular and more\r\nformal basis.\r\nFurthermore, Council members should continue to\r\nensure an increased and intensified informal information-\r\nflow towards other Members of the General Assembly, and\r\nespecially towards Members from respective regions on\r\nissues of particular concern to them.\r\nAs the second element in the context of an improved\r\nflow of information, delegations with a special interest in\r\nparticular political situations dealt with by the Security\r\nCouncil should, at an early stage of the Security Council’s\r\ndecision-making process, have and make use of the\r\npossibility of offering their views and making an input into\r\nthe Council’s work. This is especially true for countries\r\nwhich, due, inter alia, to their regional proximity, are\r\npolitically concerned by a given conflict.\r\nFurthermore, during the discussion of agenda item 33\r\nsome delegations stressed that it is important to have\r\nconsultations when economic sanctions and comparable\r\npreventive and enforcement measures are considered. This\r\nprocess should include an advance assessment of possible\r\nnegative effects on the economies of neighbouring\r\ncountries and an analysis of possible means to counteract\r\nthem. They should not, however, impede the decision-\r\nmaking as such, whenever the imposition of sanctions is\r\nrequired in accordance with the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAustria, as a country with a long-standing tradition\r\nin United Nations peace-keeping, has a special interest in\r\na closer cooperation and dialogue between the Security\r\nCouncil, the Secretariat and troop-contributing countries.\r\nWe therefore welcome the statement made by the\r\nPresident of the Security Council on\r\n3 May 1994 in which it was stressed that:\r\n“The Security Council is conscious of the need\r\nfor enhanced consultations and exchange of\r\ninformation with troop-contributing countries\r\nregarding peace-keeping operations, including their\r\nplanning, management and coordination, particularly\r\nwhen significant extensions in an operations’s\r\nmandate are in prospect.” (S/PRST/1994/22, p. 3)\r\nHaving witnessed some improvements recently, my\r\ndelegation appreciates initiatives which have been taken\r\nin this context, in particular by the delegations of New\r\nZealand and Argentina, and we are glad to hear that these\r\ninitiatives are about to yield concrete results. We would\r\nagain like to stress the importance we attach to strong and\r\nsustainable working relations with troop-contributors.\r\nMy delegation is fully aware of the work that had to\r\nbe done by the Secretariat to prepare the report before us.\r\nWe also appreciate certain changes which have been\r\nintroduced in order to make the information contained in\r\nthe annual report more easily accessible. The report\r\ncontains a very accurate listing of official documents\r\nissued by the Security Council during the period under\r\nconsideration and, as such, it is certainly a helpful tool for\r\ndelegations, and perhaps even more for students of\r\ncurrent history.\r\nFinally, I should like once again to assure the\r\nmembers of the Security Council, and in particular the\r\nPresident, of our appreciation for their dedication to the\r\nhighly sensitive work done by the Council throughout the\r\nyear and for their contribution to this debate — a debate\r\nwhich we consider to be of great importance because it\r\nconstitutes a dialogue between the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council and will certainly enhance and\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nstrengthen the relationship between the two organs in the\r\ninterest of us all.\r\nMr. Albin (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): We\r\nattach particular importance to the report submitted by the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly under Articles 15\r\nand 24 of the Charter. We consider this to be the essential\r\nlink in communications between the Security Council and\r\nthe most universal body of the United Nations in the\r\nfundamental issue of the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nWe are pleased that this was the second time the\r\nreport was adopted in an open meeting of the Council. We\r\nalso express our gratitude to Sir David Hannay, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom and President of the\r\nSecurity Council this month, for his introduction of the\r\nreport to the Assembly. We believe that these two features,\r\ninitiated last year under Brazil’s presidency, are\r\ncontributing to wider dialogue between the two organs.\r\nThis year’s report contains a more extensive\r\nintroduction, in which we note a determination to improve\r\nthe organization and presentation of issues that the Council\r\nhas discussed or deliberated on. We find the brief account\r\nof the activities of the Council’s subsidiary organs quite\r\nhelpful, particularly those dealing with the sanctions\r\nCommittees, whose importance has recently increased. We\r\nalso appreciate the effort to incorporate in the report two\r\nnew appendices — appendix VII, listing the\r\ncommunications from the President of the Security Council\r\nor the Secretary-General; and appendix VIII, listing the\r\nreports of the Secretary-General issued during the period\r\ncovered by the report.\r\nThese efforts have no doubt contributed to improving\r\nthe channels of communication between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council. However, a great deal\r\nremains to be done. In our view, presentation of the report\r\nshould not be simply a formal fulfilment of an obligation.\r\nRather, its objective should be to provide complete\r\ninformation to the Assembly. We would like the document\r\nbefore us to contain elements of an evaluation that would\r\nenable us to grasp the basis of the Council’s decisions and\r\nactions. We acknowledge that additional information is\r\nprovided in the introduction, but the present document still\r\ndoes not enable the General Assembly to consider the\r\nmatter fully.\r\nIn the period covered by the report — that is, from\r\n16 June 1993 to 15 June 1994 — a number of important\r\nevents have remained on the international scene, and many\r\nof them have been considered by the Security Council.\r\nGiven the number and substance of the items on the\r\nCouncil’s agenda, the States Members of the United\r\nNations have a pressing need to analyse and assess the\r\nactions taken and the decisions adopted by the Council on\r\ntheir behalf. It is only natural that we should be\r\nincreasingly interested in its work and in the way it\r\nfunctions, as well as in the rationale for its decisions.\r\nEnhancing the transparency of the Security Council’s\r\nmethods of work and strengthening the effectiveness of its\r\ndecisions are among the fundamental issues to be\r\naddressed by the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in\r\nthe Membership of the Security Council. This is reflected\r\nin the efforts being made to ensure more direct,\r\ntransparent and timely communication between the\r\nCouncil and the Assembly.\r\nLast year as we addressed this item we suggested\r\nthat it would be useful to have the United Nations\r\nJournal indicate items to be taken up in private informal\r\nconsultations of the Council. We are now convinced that\r\nthis has been most useful for all delegations and has\r\nproved to be a sound practice adopted by the Council.\r\nThe fears of certain parties were unwarranted and this has\r\nin no way affected the work of the Council.\r\nAn exchange of information between the Council\r\nand delegations has been taking place but in a disorderly\r\nfashion and with great difficulty. After private\r\nconsultations of the Council we believe that delegations\r\nshould be informed of what has happened in an organized\r\nway as they seek daily to follow up the work of that\r\nbody. The Council should in the interests of all adopt\r\nmeasures to strengthen communication links. It is\r\nprecisely for this reason that we welcome the fact that last\r\nThursday the President of the Council, Sir David Hannay,\r\nheld an informal meeting with delegations to report on the\r\nactivities of the Council, and he added that there was a\r\nwish for this exchange to take place periodically. We\r\nencourage the Council to continue to adopt further\r\npractical measures so as to enhance dialogue and\r\ninteraction with other Members.\r\nAnother proposal we mentioned earlier refers to the\r\neffective presentation of special reports as provided for in\r\nthe Charter. There are issues of great interest to all about\r\nwhich we would like to have more information and on\r\nwhich the Security Council could report to the General\r\nAssembly in greater detail and in a more timely fashion.\r\nFurthermore, we believe that the submission of quarterly\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nreports could help to expand communication channels. A\r\nspecial rapporteur of the Council appointed to report to\r\nMember States would also improve cooperation between\r\nMembers and the Council.\r\nWe would also like to see a deepening of the fruitful\r\nexchanges between the President of the Security Council\r\nand regional groups. We are all aware of the complexity of\r\npeace-keeping operations, and for that reason we endorse\r\nenhanced communication between troop- and personnel-\r\ncontributing countries and the Council as proposed recently\r\nby Argentina and New Zealand. We are aware of the\r\nimpact of the imposition of sanctions on third countries and\r\ntherefore believe that a dialogue between them and the\r\nCouncil, as provided in Article 50 of the Charter, would\r\nenhance the effectiveness of that organ’s decisions.\r\nThe annual report of the Security Council must cease\r\nto be a mere formality. It is clearly out of step with the\r\nnew circumstances surrounding matters relating to\r\ninternational peace and security. The full potential of\r\nparagraph 3 of Article 24 and paragraph 1 of Article 15 of\r\nthe Charter must be given a chance to develop. Members\r\nhave entrusted the Security Council with the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. This in turn implies the accountability of the\r\nCouncil to the Assembly.\r\nWe sincerely hope that in the near future we will be\r\nable to engage in an exercise of renewed dialogue and\r\ncommunication between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This will undoubtedly require a report\r\ncontaining substantive elements and analysis of the\r\ndecisions and activities of the Council. The maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, after all, is a purpose\r\ncommon to all States Members of the Organization.\r\nMrs. Fréchette (Canada): As we approach the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations this year’s report of the\r\nSecurity Council underscores to all of us, if such a\r\nreminder is necessary, the tremendous challenges faced by\r\nthe international community in efforts to maintain peace\r\nand security. The wide-ranging number of conflicts the\r\nSecurity Council currently deals with demonstrates that\r\nafter 49 years we remain far from achieving global peace,\r\none of the Organization’s central objectives. However,\r\nwhile there are problems, the Council’s experience over the\r\nlast year also shows that only a concerted and determined\r\neffort on the part of the international community can solve\r\nthem.\r\nThe Council’s record also reaffirms that the nature\r\nof many of the conflicts we are now confronted with has\r\nchanged. In the post-cold-war period essentially\r\nintra-State conflicts, with numerous and complex origins,\r\ndominate the Council’s deliberations. In the face of this\r\nemerging dynamic, Canada answers “Yes” to those who\r\nask whether the United Nations, and particularly the\r\nSecurity Council, should be involved in resolving them.\r\nThe international community cannot stand aside as\r\nconflicts which imperil the lives of millions of innocent\r\npeople and threaten their most fundamental rights, fester,\r\ndegenerate and eventually explode.\r\nJust as it is clear that the challenges facing the\r\ninternational community are both changing and daunting,\r\nit is also evident that the Security Council is no Merlin,\r\nwho in one stroke can bring them to a peaceful outcome.\r\nThat is expecting too much. The Council’s record over\r\nthe past year represents a transition. From a period of\r\neuphoria, when belief in the Council’s abilities to prevail\r\nremained high, Council members, indeed all of us, are\r\ntoday keenly aware of the limitations of its influence.\r\nThis realization notwithstanding, the Council should\r\navoid retreat. Far from diminishing, the need for firm,\r\ndecisive and united action remains essential. The Security\r\nCouncil has a unique role to play in the preservation of\r\ninternational peace and security. In responding to new\r\nchallenges, the Council is on the right track and moving\r\nforward, even though the steps it has taken have not\r\nalways proved capable of solving all the problems.\r\nAs a major contributor to peace-keeping operations\r\nwith close to 2,800 soldiers and police officers serving in\r\neight missions, Canada is deeply interested in and often\r\ndirectly affected by the Council’s decisions. Looking back\r\nat the Council’s record over the past year we wish to\r\noffer a few observations which we hope the Council will\r\ntake into account in its future deliberations.\r\nIn developing mandates for peace-keeping\r\noperations, or modifying them in mid-course, the Council\r\nshould aim to spell out objectives and priorities as clearly\r\nas possible. This is essential for those who are left to\r\nimplement them. Where there are multiple components to\r\na mandate, prioritization is necessary to increase clarity.\r\nThis year in Somalia, the United Nations Operation in\r\nSomalia (UNOSOM II) was operating under sometimes\r\nconflicting direction from the Council. The less mandates\r\nare open to ambiguity, the better the chances costly\r\nmistakes can be avoided and overall goals achieved.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nIt is equally important for the Security Council to\r\nresist incrementalism in revising tasks for peace-keeping\r\noperations. Adding responsibilities to operations to deal\r\nwith new challenges without clearly refocusing the\r\nobjectives of a mission or providing it with adequate\r\nadditional resources to handle new tasks, muddies the water\r\nand makes it difficult for those on the ground to carry out\r\ntheir jobs effectively.\r\nAt the same time, the Security Council needs to avoid\r\nsending mixed signals about what operations can or are\r\nmeant to achieve. Doing so can lead to false expectations\r\nand damage the credibility of an operation.\r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina illustrates\r\nboth problems. Canada was and is in the forefront of those\r\ncontributing to the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR). That Force continues to be a vital\r\nrequirement of life for over a million Bosnians. However,\r\nthe Council’s decision to give additional tasks to\r\nUNPROFOR, and ambiguous messages about its mission,\r\nhave led many to confuse this operation with a force both\r\nequipped and mandated to impose peace upon warring\r\nparties. It is neither, but the Security Council’s actions have\r\nat times contributed to this misperception.\r\nThe Security Council is most effective when its\r\nactions are guided by clear and agreed goals, purposefully\r\nand resolutely pursued, and involve measured actions. The\r\nCouncil’s management of the Haitian crisis is an\r\noutstanding example. Throughout the crisis, the Council did\r\nnot waver in its unity of purpose — the restoration to office\r\nof President Aristide. With this objective, the Council’s\r\nresponse to the continued intransigence of the de facto\r\nregime was consistent and graduated. Only when one action\r\nproved inadequate did the Council move to the next, more\r\nserious stage, culminating in the authorization of a\r\nmultinational coalition under the auspices of the United\r\nNations to carry out the Council’s objectives. The result\r\nachieved in Haiti demonstrates how common objectives\r\nmatched with determined and measured action can translate\r\ninto success for the Council.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nConsultations with troop contributors are an essential\r\nfactor in ensuring the success of a peace-keeping\r\noperation. We welcome the presidential statement of 3\r\nMay 1994 (S/PRST/1994/22), in which the Council\r\nrecognized the need to consult the troop-contributing\r\ncountries when a change or extension in an operation’s\r\nmandate is in prospect. The meetings currently chaired by\r\nthe Secretariat, to which Council members are invited, are\r\nuseful and welcome. However, in their present\r\nconfiguration, they do not entirely meet the need for the\r\nCouncil to consult with troop contributors. As we have\r\nalready said in the debate in the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, we hope that the Council will follow up on its 3\r\nMay 1994 statement by fully committing itself to\r\nengaging in a substantive and direct dialogue with troop\r\ncontributors when renewing or modifying mandates. This\r\ncan be done without in any way challenging the Council’s\r\nfinal responsibility for deciding on the nature of a peace-\r\nkeeping mandate.\r\nFinally, there has been much comment on the\r\nCouncil’s inability to respond effectively to conflicts that\r\nrapidly worsen. It is not that the Council does not have a\r\nsense of what should be done; rather, the problem is the\r\nabsence of a rapid-intervention capability. We hope that\r\nthe anticipated Council summit next January will be an\r\noccasion to give further consideration to rapid-response\r\nmechanisms.\r\nThe Security Council needs to remain fully engaged\r\nin dealing with new circumstances and addressing new\r\nchallenges. The last 12 months have made it clear that the\r\nCouncil is still seeking the most appropriate ways of\r\ndoing so. Through constructive observations and\r\nsuggestions, we can all help to ensure that the Council is\r\nequipped to carry out its responsibilities. We are\r\nconvinced that its members will heed the lessons both of\r\nthis year’s setbacks and of its successes.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): First of all, I should like to thank the President\r\nof the Security Council, Sir David Hannay, for\r\nintroducing the Council’s report, which covers the period\r\nfrom 16 June 1993 to 15 June 1994. This is a\r\ncontinuation of the welcome practice which was so\r\nappropriately inaugurated last year by the Permanent\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nRepresentative of Brazil, Mr. Sardenberg, then President of\r\nthe Council. It is to be hoped that this practice will be\r\nsustained by a new spirit of cooperation between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council and will have\r\na profound impact on the actual content of future reports.\r\nThe Algerian delegation also welcomes the fact that\r\nthe Council’s report, for the second consecutive year, was\r\nadopted in a public meeting of the Council. We are pleased,\r\ntoo, that the monthly programme of Council activities\r\ncontinues to be disseminated, and that the United Nations\r\nJournal announces the agendas for public meetings. We can\r\nalso note with satisfaction that this year’s report contains a\r\nmore detailed introduction and two new appendices\r\ncontaining, respectively, a list of communications from the\r\nPresident of the Council and the Secretary-General and a\r\nlist of the reports of the Secretary-General issued during the\r\nperiod covered by the report. However, these innovations,\r\nwhich we welcome, should not conceal the essential point\r\nat issue, which continues to be how to improve the\r\ninformation given to States that are not members of the\r\nCouncil — an objective on which, unfortunately, there has\r\nnot been any particularly positive development in the past\r\nyear. We cannot refrain from expressing the fear that there\r\nhas been something of a retreat from the relative openness\r\nof last year, since it can easily be seen when we read the\r\nSecurity Council’s report for this year that the hopes and\r\nthe comments made a year ago on this matter are as urgent\r\nand relevant today as they were then. They have not yet\r\nbeen sufficiently taken into account, with respect either to\r\nthe form and the content of the report, or to transparency in\r\nthe Security Council’s work, or to relations between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Council. I therefore do not need\r\nto repeat here observations that have been supported by an\r\never-growing wave of opinion within the United Nations.\r\nThe interest displayed by the States members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the Security Council’s report is not\r\nonly legitimate but indeed legal, because it stems from the\r\nactual provisions of the Charter. It is true that the Security\r\nCouncil bears the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. But it is\r\nequally true that this is the result of a kind of delegation of\r\nauthority on a contractual basis, which was granted to the\r\nCouncil so that the Organization’s action in this area could\r\nbe both prompt and effective, and on condition that, in\r\nexercising this responsibility, the Council acted on behalf\r\nof all the Members of the Organization. Quite clearly, we\r\nsee the existence here of a dynamic link between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, a link intended\r\nby the founders of the Organization to ensure that these two\r\nprincipal organs would have relations of cooperation based\r\non complementarity and mutual respect for each other’s\r\nprerogatives. It was naturally also understood that general\r\ncoordination would be undertaken by the single plenary\r\norgan which is the very centre of the institutional edifice\r\nof the Organization — that is, the General Assembly, on\r\nwhich, in addition, Article 10 of the Charter confers the\r\nright to discuss\r\n“any questions or any matters...relating to the\r\npowers and functions of any organs provided for in\r\nthe present Charter”\r\nand to\r\n“make recommendations to the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations or to the Security Council or to both\r\non any such questions or matters.”\r\nIn fact, the mechanism of annual and special reports\r\nprovided for by the Charter as one of the umbilical links\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly\r\nis a clear, if incomplete and imperfect, expression of the\r\nneed for the deliberative organ, which represents the\r\ncollective will of the Member States, to monitor the\r\nCouncil’s actions, since the participants in the San\r\nFrancisco Conference noted that the soul of any\r\ndemocracy is control. If one needs convincing, all one\r\nneed do is refer to the documents of the founding\r\nConference to find that a great deal of thought was given\r\nto the institutional life of the United Nations with the aim\r\nof forearming it against certain dysfunctions which\r\npractice has, unfortunately, brought to light in abundance.\r\nThus, Belgium urged in San Francisco that lessons\r\nbe learned from the failure of the League of Nations,\r\nstressing that the most representative organ of the\r\nOrganization, the General Assembly, must have sovereign\r\ncompetence to interpret the Charter. Venezuela, invoking\r\nthe future Article 24 of the Charter, expressed the belief\r\nthat such delegation of powers as the Article provided for\r\ncould be accepted if the General Assembly was given the\r\nnecessary oversight powers and if the Member States\r\nwere able to have recourse to them.\r\nThis demand for control is gaining in force and\r\nrelevance now that the disturbances caused by the cold\r\nwar in the normal functioning of United Nations bodies\r\nhas stopped and it has been established that general\r\nsupport for the Security Council’s actions is the basis of\r\ntheir legitimacy and strengthens their effectiveness.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nThis means that the structure and content of the\r\nSecurity Council’s annual report to the General Assembly\r\nmust be improved and that the introduction of special\r\nreports should be seriously considered. It also offers the\r\nopportunity to reaffirm resolution 48/264, adopted by\r\nconsensus on 29 July, which, inter alia, encourages the\r\nSecurity Council to:\r\n“provide in a timely manner a clear and informative\r\naccount of its work, including its resolutions and other\r\ndecisions, including its resolutions and other decisions,\r\ninclusive of measures taken under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter”. (resolution 48/264, para. 3)\r\nLastly, it implies that the Security Council’s work, which\r\nembodies the hopes and frustrations of a great many States\r\nand a large sector of public opinion, would benefit from\r\ngreater concertation and explicitness, particularly in the\r\ncontext of this debate, which should be the highpoint in\r\nefforts to affirm the collective responsibility of States\r\nMembers of the United Nations for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nFrom this viewpoint, my delegation supports the\r\nproposal made by the Chairman and other members of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement during this debate that this agenda\r\nitem remain open, allowing the consultations recommended\r\nby resolution 48/264 to take place.\r\nMr. Graf zu Rantzau (Germany): We appreciate the\r\npresentation of the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The report is very extensive and its\r\ncompilation was extremely work-intensive, reflecting the\r\nvast agenda the Security Council had to deal with during\r\nthe past 12 months, without, however, providing us with\r\nmuch insight into and analysis of, the Council’s\r\ndeliberations.\r\nIn his report of 2 September 1994 on the work of the\r\nOrganization, the Secretary-General pointed out that until\r\nlast year consideration of the report of the Security Council\r\nin the General Assembly attracted only limited attention,\r\nwhile at the forty-eighth session numerous delegations made\r\nstatements on it. This year, too, many delegations are\r\ncommenting. We see two reasons for this growing interest:\r\nthe enhanced activities of the Security Council and the\r\nongoing discussion on Security Council reform.\r\nWe have stated repeatedly, and we say it again today:\r\nthe Security Council’s effectiveness is based on its\r\ncredibility, and its credibility depends largely on both the\r\nrepresentative character of the Council and whether\r\nUnited Nations Member States feel that it acts on their\r\nbehalf, as demanded by Article 24 of the Charter. It is\r\ntherefore essential that there be a free flow of information\r\nbetween Council members and the general membership.\r\nIn the past — and we can attest to this from our own\r\nexperience — the general membership has often felt\r\nlocked out of and excluded from the Council’s\r\ndeliberations and decision-making.\r\nIn our view, two fundamental issues must be\r\naddressed to improve this situation. First, non-members of\r\nthe Security Council must have sufficient access to\r\ninformation about the Council’s work. “Sufficient”, in this\r\ncontext, means a degree of information which satisfies the\r\nneeds of individual Member States. It is natural that,\r\ndepending on the item under discussion, Member States\r\nwill have varying degrees of interest. Geographic nearness\r\nto a conflict, historic or economic ties, or the fact that\r\ntroops were contributed to a specific peace-keeping\r\noperation, are factors which will most likely increase a\r\nMember State’s need to know in detail and without delay\r\nwhat is being discussed and decided. Secondly, non-\r\nmembers of the Security Council should have the\r\nopportunity to contribute their views and information,\r\nwhenever appropriate, to the Security Council’s\r\ndeliberations.\r\nThroughout our debate about the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, as well as in the\r\ndiscussions of the Working Group for the revitalization of\r\nthe work of the General Assembly, various ideas have\r\nbeen put forward as to how these objectives could best be\r\nachieved. In the meantime, certain steps have been taken\r\nby the Security Council to improve the situation. My\r\ndelegation, for instance, highly appreciates the publication\r\nof the agenda of informal meetings in the United Nations\r\nJournal and the briefings on informal Security Council\r\nmeetings established last week by the Council’s\r\npresidency on a trial basis. Another example in this\r\nregard is the attempt to react to demands for improving\r\nthe Security Council’s report to the General Assembly. As\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Ambassador\r\nSardenberg of Brazil introduced the report personally at\r\nthe forty-eighth session, as did the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom today.\r\nFurthermore, attempts have been made to obtain more\r\nregular and substantive input into the Council’s work, in\r\nparticular from troop-contributing countries. My\r\ndelegation welcomes these initiatives.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nHowever, more steps still need to be taken. A majority\r\nof Member States seem to agree that a certain number of\r\nclosed informal meetings are necessary for the Council’s\r\nefficient and effective functioning. At the same time, we\r\nagree with the representative of France, who, during the\r\ndebate on agenda item 33 two weeks ago, expressed\r\nsupport for an enhanced dialogue between the Security\r\nCouncil and the general membership in formal meetings.\r\nFor the remaining informal meetings, it should be assured\r\nthat non-members of the Council can follow the events.\r\nFurthermore, it is often difficult, particularly for small\r\nMember States with limited resources, to be present when\r\nthe Security Council calls an ad hoc meeting. A mechanism\r\nshould be established to notify all Member States about\r\nmeetings called at short notice.\r\nConsultations with troop-contributing countries are\r\ncrucial for the effectiveness of the Security Council’s work.\r\nDecisions cannot be implemented and peace-keeping\r\noperations cannot be carried out if those who do the on-site\r\nwork feel that they lack information or cannot make their\r\nvoice heard. Germany therefore clearly supports proposals\r\nto establish a mechanism for coordination between the\r\nSecurity Council and troop-contributing countries.\r\nArgentina and New Zealand, encouraged by Denmark,\r\nFinland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Luxembourg, the\r\nNetherlands and Uruguay, have made a useful proposal. We\r\nappreciate that in its deliberations this morning the Security\r\nCouncil has discussed this proposal and that there appears\r\nto be widespread support for it.\r\nWith regard to transparency and openness, the Security\r\nCouncil has introduced improvements. The ills have been\r\nidentified and some promising remedies have been\r\nadministered, but we are still somewhat short of a cure. A\r\nlarge number of Member States have expressed the view —\r\nwhich is fully supported by my delegation — that an\r\nexpansion of the Security Council can be only one aspect\r\nof our attempt to improve the Council’s credibility and thus\r\nits effectiveness. Increasing its transparency, facilitating the\r\nflow of information between the Council and non-members\r\nof the Council and therefore reassuring the general\r\nmembership that its views are adequately represented by the\r\nSecurity Council are of equal importance.\r\nMy Government is confident that agreement can be\r\nfound on the necessary further steps to improve the\r\nSecurity Council’s transparency as part of an overall\r\npackage that will mark the end of our discussion about how\r\nto make the principal organ of the United Nations for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security compatible with both\r\nan increased membership and changed world realities.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work:\r\nreports of the General Committee\r\nThird report of the General Committee\r\n(A/49/250/Add.2)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nthird report of the General Committee concerns two\r\nrequests for the inclusion in the agenda of the current\r\nsession of additional sub-items submitted by the\r\ndelegations of Rwanda and Zaire.\r\nI first draw the attention of representatives to\r\nparagraph 1 (a) of the report.\r\nThe General Committee recommends the inclusion\r\nin the agenda of the current session of an additional sub-\r\nitem under item 37 — “Strengthening of the coordination\r\nof humanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations, including special economic assistance” —\r\nentitled “Emergency international assistance for a solution\r\nto the problem of refugees, the restoration of total peace,\r\nreconstruction and socio-economic development in war-\r\nstricken Rwanda”.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\ninclude this additional sub-item in its agenda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\nparagraph 1 (b) of the report, the General Committee\r\nrecommends that the sub-item be considered directly in\r\nplenary meeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts this\r\nrecommendation of the General Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\nshould like to inform members that this sub-item becomes\r\nsub-item (f) of agenda item 37.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 31 October 1994\r\nNext, I draw the attention of representatives to\r\nparagraph 2 (a) of the report.\r\nThe General Committee recommends the inclusion in\r\nthe agenda of the current session of an additional sub-item\r\nunder item 37 — “Strengthening of the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the United\r\nNations, including special economic assistance” — entitled\r\n“Special assistance to countries receiving refugees from\r\nRwanda”.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\ninclude this additional sub-item in its agenda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\nparagraph 2 (b) of the report, the General Committee\r\nrecommends that the sub-item be considered directly in\r\nplenary meeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts this\r\nrecommendation of the General Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\nshould like to inform members that this sub-item becomes\r\nsub-item (g) of agenda item 37.\r\nThe General Assembly will consider agenda item 37\r\nas a whole on Wednesday, 23 November.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.\r\n29\r\n"
