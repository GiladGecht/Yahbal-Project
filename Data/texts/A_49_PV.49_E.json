(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Touré (Guinea-\r\nBissau), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.40 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/49/2)\r\nMr. Keating (New Zealand): My delegation is pleased\r\nto participate in this debate on the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council. We appreciate this opportunity to reflect\r\non the nature of the relationship between this Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThere are six organs established by the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. Two of these organs have power formally\r\nto bind Member States: first, the International Court of\r\nJustice in respect of matters of law which are in dispute\r\nbetween States and which are within the Court’s\r\njurisdiction; and secondly, the Security Council in respect\r\nof measures necessary for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. The Security Council also has a role\r\nwith respect to enforcement of the Court’s judgments.\r\nThe other organs of the United Nations — the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council and\r\nthis General Assembly — are deliberative political organs\r\nwith wide-ranging mandates but with no authority to bind\r\nexcept in two very specific ways. The General Assembly\r\ncan direct the work of the Secretariat, which is, of course,\r\nthe sixth organ, and it can bind Member States financially\r\nby virtue of the contributions which it may assess under\r\nArticle 17.\r\nAs we see it, each of these organs is an integral part\r\nof a single whole, and the Charter provides for complex\r\ninterrelationships between these organs. This web of\r\nrelationships involves reporting, specific channels for\r\nrecommendations, prescribed processes for elections,\r\njudicial review in certain defined circumstances, and\r\nfinally, political consideration of decisions. It is a series\r\nof relationships involving checks and balances that were\r\ndesigned by the founders of the Charter to avoid the\r\ndominance of the United Nations — and ultimately of the\r\nMember States — by any one of the organs.\r\nIn considering the relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, we do not think it is\r\nappropriate, as some have suggested, to assert that the\r\nGeneral Assembly is somehow the superior body and that\r\nthe Security Council is a subordinate body and as such is\r\naccountable — or should be — to the General Assembly.\r\nThat is not what the Charter prescribes.\r\nSome delegations have suggested that we explore the\r\npossibility of amendments to the Charter to adjust\r\nformally the relationship between these two organs. My\r\ndelegation would never oppose the idea of serious\r\ndiscussion about ways really to democratize the United\r\nNations — but, of course, this is a major issue.\r\nDemocratization could not stop with the simple question\r\nof the relationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council. If we were to contemplate a\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nconstitutional format for this Organization of ours under\r\nwhich the Council would be like, for example, a cabinet in\r\na national government accountable to a parliament, we\r\nwould in our view need to look at other key questions such\r\nas according the General Assembly the kind of plenary and\r\nbinding powers that a real parliament enjoys — and that\r\nwould involve inter alia the power to bind by majority\r\nvote. It would also have to involve binding and compulsory\r\ndispute settlement, and that means making it impossible to\r\nopt out of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International\r\nCourt. But we see no evidence at all at this point in time\r\nthat the Members of this Organization, including some of\r\nthose most keen to reform the Security Council, are yet\r\nready to engage in such a fundamental reform of the United\r\nNations.\r\nOur conclusion therefore is that the legal balance of\r\npower set out in the Charter, between the Council and the\r\nAssembly, will be with us for some years yet. The purpose\r\nof our present exercise must therefore be to look, in the\r\ncontext of the annual report of the Security Council, at\r\nwhat improvements can be made within the framework of\r\nthe current legal balance.\r\nWe agree strongly with those who say that change is\r\nneeded. We believe change is needed in the practice and\r\nthe culture of the Security Council — the way it operates\r\nin practice. But what sort of changes are required?\r\nWe believe that the report of the Security Council\r\ncurrently before this Assembly indicates some valuable\r\nchanges which have been made since the Council’s\r\nprevious report was considered by the Assembly.\r\nFirst, subjects for discussion at the informal\r\nconsultations of the Council are now announced in the\r\nJournal, so that General Assembly members do have\r\nadvance notice of them.\r\nSecondly, The Council’s provisional monthly work\r\nprogramme is now circulated to all Missions and contains\r\na calendar of significant dates relevant to the mandates of\r\npeace-keeping operations and also of sanctions regimes.\r\nOpportunities for input therefore exist.\r\nThirdly, consultations between the President of the\r\nCouncil and the chairmen of the regional groups have been\r\ninitiated.\r\nFourthly, the annual report itself is now prepared on\r\ntime, the organization of its contents is more helpful and it\r\ncontains a modicum of analytical comment — although as\r\nto the content of the report, I have to say that from my\r\ndelegation’s perspective, we see little value in reproducing\r\nwithin the report the texts of all the Council resolutions\r\nand statements. These are readily available elsewhere and\r\neven the minor cost savings of avoiding this duplication\r\nwould be worth while.\r\nFifthly, informal and ad hoc mechanisms have been\r\nfound, albeit rather too rarely in our view, for the Council\r\nto consult with United Nations Members outside the\r\nCouncil on matters of significance to a particular region.\r\nFinally, on one occasion consultations did take place\r\nbetween the presidency and Member States directly\r\naffected by an untoward turn of events. In the case I am\r\nreferring to, consultations were held with troop\r\ncontributors to the United Nations Assistance Mission for\r\nRwanda, during the crisis which followed the death of the\r\nPresident of Rwanda in April.\r\nAll these developments are positive and move in the\r\nright direction. They improve the transparency of the\r\nCouncil’s work, but there is much more that could be\r\ndone.\r\nThe first area in which, we believe, more could be\r\ndone relates to information about the work of the Council.\r\nThe process of casual briefings by delegations after\r\nsessions of informal consultations has never been\r\nsatisfactory. It is haphazard and means that only certain\r\ndelegations who happen to be waiting get briefed. This\r\nleads to errors in that the information is hurried and often\r\nthird hand, with the risk that delegations might be\r\nseriously misrepresented. We welcome the initial step\r\ntaken by the President of the Council, last month, to hold\r\nbriefings for interested delegations. We believe that this\r\npractice should continue, and it should continue if\r\npossible on a daily basis. We also believe that it can be\r\ndone without prejudicing the confidentiality and efficiency\r\nof the informal consultations.\r\nThe second area for the further improvement which\r\nwe believe should be effected in the report of the Security\r\nCouncil would relate to an increase in the capacity of the\r\nCouncil to consult with and receive input from non-\r\nmembers of the Council. We believe that a major source\r\nof concern is that a State which raises an issue before the\r\nCouncil, but which is not itself a member of the Council,\r\nhas no opportunity under the Council’s current operating\r\nprocesses to present its position publicly until after the\r\nCouncil has decided in private what action it intends to\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\ntake. This is not only a problem of transparency; we believe\r\nthat it is also in some ways a problem of due process. We\r\nbelieve that the Council needs to provide more\r\nopportunities to allow States not members of the Council to\r\nexpress their views publicly in advance of the Council’s\r\ncommencing private consultations on its response.\r\nAnother major concern, which is felt very strongly by\r\nmembers of the General Assembly, in particular those that\r\nare troop-contributing countries, is that the Council is not\r\nproviding sufficiently responsive mechanisms for\r\nconsultation with troop-contributing countries on major\r\nissues relating to peace-keeping operations. I believe it is\r\nimportant to record here our appreciation of the efforts of\r\nthe Secretariat to date in this regard to organize meetings of\r\ntroop contributors for the provision of information. These\r\nare useful, but, as so many other colleagues who have\r\nspoken in this debate have pointed out, they are no\r\nsubstitute for consultation between the Council and troop-\r\ncontributing countries. My delegation has joined in the\r\nSecurity Council with the delegation of Argentina to make\r\na proposal, set out in document S/1994/1063, which would\r\nprovide for a substantial improvement in this consultative\r\nprocess and a more appropriate recognition of the\r\nrequirement that exists on occasion for members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to have a direct dialogue with the\r\nmembers of the Security Council on matters such as peace-\r\nkeeping operations. We remain hopeful that a positive\r\noutcome to this initiative will be achieved.\r\nWe also believe that there are cases in which the\r\nCouncil’s consideration of issues would benefit from\r\nmechanisms to allow informal input by regional countries\r\nclosely interested in or affected by a situation. As has\r\noccurred at least once in the past, working groups of the\r\nCouncil could liaise with such groupings of States to\r\nreceive input.\r\nFinally, how are we to proceed in the future? My\r\ndelegation believes that these are matters on which only the\r\nCouncil itself can in fact take decisions. They are not\r\nmatters which can be imposed by a vote in the General\r\nAssembly. The Council has shown that it is capable of\r\naddressing these sorts of issues, and we are very pleased\r\nthat it is making some attempts to reform its culture to\r\nreflect the new climate that exists in this Organization. But,\r\nunfortunately, on some issues the Council allows itself to\r\nbe sidetracked into delay or, worse, inaction by a small\r\nminority or on occasion by a sole dissenting voice. We\r\nbelieve that this is unacceptable on matters which beyond\r\nany shadow of a doubt are of a procedural nature and on\r\nwhich the wish of the majority is clear.\r\nFinally, with respect to the role that the General\r\nAssembly can properly play on these issues, we believe\r\nthere is room within the respective constitutional roles of\r\nthe two organs for the General Assembly to formulate\r\nrecommendations to the Security Council. If we are to\r\nmake improvements within the current framework of our\r\nOrganization, then it is entirely reasonable, in our view,\r\nthat both organs should have an opportunity to suggest\r\nhow this should be done. And it is also entirely\r\nreasonable that dissenting minorities in the Council should\r\nhear very clearly the voice of the majority in the wider\r\nOrganization.\r\nMr. Remirez de Estenoz Barciela (Cuba)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): Allow me first to say that\r\nmy delegation welcomes the fact that the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, in his capacity as\r\nPresident of the Security Council, introduced the report of\r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly. We hope\r\nthat this practice, which we are encouraged to note was\r\nreinstituted last year by the Permanent Representative of\r\nBrazil, will become a tradition to be followed by future\r\nPresidents of the Security Council.\r\nIt is particularly important for us that the number of\r\ndelegations participating in this debate has continued to\r\nincrease. In our view, the report of the Security Council\r\nis of interest to all delegations, as the Council has become\r\nnot only the most active organ of the Organization, but\r\nalso the one whose activities increasingly affect a large\r\nnumber of countries.\r\nIt must be recalled that this item is included on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly in compliance with\r\nprovisions of the Charter. Article 15 requests the Council\r\nto provide annual reports to the Assembly, since, as stated\r\nin Article 24, the Council’s powers are conferred upon it\r\nby the Members of the United Nations — that is, the\r\nGeneral Assembly — on whose behalf it acts. In other\r\nwords, when the General Assembly considers the report\r\nit is not only taking cognizance of issues of the greatest\r\ninterest to the entire international community, but is also\r\nfulfilling responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter.\r\nNevertheless, as we have indicated in the past, the\r\ncontent of this report does not enable the General\r\nAssembly truly to fulfil its responsibilities in an effective\r\nmanner. In its present form, the report of the Security\r\nCouncil may be useful to libraries and documentation\r\ncentres, but it is not useful to States, which, in accordance\r\nwith the Charter, must assess the activities in which the\r\nCouncil engages on our behalf and determine whether or\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nnot the Council is making proper use of the powers that we\r\nourselves have entrusted to it.\r\nThe delegation of Cuba is among those that have\r\nsystematically criticized the partial and cursory manner in\r\nwhich the work of the Council is presented to the\r\nAssembly. Last year we observed that a number of positive\r\nchanges had been made in the report, thanks to the efforts\r\nof several members of the Council. It seems that such\r\nefforts have not continued, and this year’s report is totally\r\ndevoid of any analytical material that would allow us to\r\nassess what the Council has done or failed to do.\r\nThis is closely associated with the increasing number\r\nof requests for greater transparency in the activities of the\r\nCouncil. Prevailing practices, which are characterized by\r\nthe closed and secret nature of most of the substantive\r\ndeliberations of the Council members — and\r\nnotwithstanding some marginal improvements in the course\r\nof the past two or three years, which we of course\r\nrecognize — make it increasingly necessary that requests\r\nfor an analytical, complete and comprehensive report be\r\nmet.\r\nOther elements in the Council’s activities are also\r\nlinked to the issue we are considering today. The Security\r\nCouncil has shown an increasing tendency to consider as its\r\nown a number of issues in the work of the Organization\r\nthat have nothing to do with the powers conferred upon it\r\nby the Charter. It arrogates to itself the right — which has\r\nnot been given it — to decide when a situation does or\r\ndoes not pose a threat to international peace and security,\r\nand this might lend impetus to the growing tendency to\r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of States; it arrogates to\r\nitself, without appropriate guidelines laid down by the\r\ndemocratic and universal bodies of the United Nations, the\r\npower to determine when there is a need to have recourse\r\nto the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter. For today’s\r\nSecurity Council, and for some of its permanent members\r\nin particular, that organ constitutes the Organization’s only\r\nvalid body; this conveniently ignores the fact that each one\r\nof the bodies that make up the United Nations has its own\r\nfunctions and powers.\r\nThe Council’s tendency to act as an autonomous body\r\ncontinues to grow, and, given its responsibilities with regard\r\nto international peace and security and its consequent power\r\nto impose sanctions or resort to the use of force, that\r\ntendency is increasingly dangerous. It is also cause for\r\nconcern that every time the Council takes up an issue,\r\nhowever simple, it immediately decides to keep it under\r\nreview, thereby enabling some of its members continuously\r\nand repeatedly to invoke Article 12 of the Charter and\r\nrendering it more and more difficult for other United\r\nNations bodies to act and eventually make valid\r\ncontributions to the solution of conflicts and disputes. To\r\nthis should be added other situations and actions, such as\r\nthe undue proliferation of peace-keeping operations and\r\nthe granting of licences to individual countries or groups\r\nof countries to act on behalf of the Council.\r\nIndeed, appropriate information to the Member\r\nStates, adequate structure and analysis in the annual\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly,\r\nas well as special reports presented when circumstances\r\nwarrant, as provided by the Charter, are all necessary and\r\nimperative if the Organization is to become effectively\r\ndemocratized and fulfil the purposes and principles for\r\nwhich it was created.\r\nNothing that the Council does or fails to do should\r\nbe hidden from the Members of the Organization, on\r\nwhose behalf, I repeat, the Council acts. Here, I am\r\nforced to note that the document that we are now\r\nconsidering does not contain a single word concerning the\r\ntenor of the Security Council’s real discussions, and that,\r\nin our view, is a virtual violation of the Charter and its\r\nprovisions setting forth the Council’s obligation to report\r\nto the General Assembly. In so doing, the Security\r\nCouncil is preventing the General Assembly from\r\ncarrying out its legitimate responsibilities, even its\r\nresponsibility to make recommendations to the Council\r\nregarding its activities or modus operandi.\r\nThere can be no doubt whatsoever that in order to\r\nallow the Assembly to fulfil those functions Member\r\nStates should ensure that it also has the means to\r\nimplement the powers conferred upon it by the Charter\r\nwith regard to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity and the peaceful settlement of disputes, powers\r\nthat are set forth, inter alia, in Articles 10, 11 and 14 of\r\nthe Charter itself.\r\nIn light of this, my delegation would like to express\r\nits complete endorsement of the statement on this item\r\nmade by the representative of Indonesia on behalf of the\r\nmembers of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and\r\nto emphasize most particularly the need for this item to\r\nremain open after the conclusion of the present debate, in\r\norder to allow for the holding of the consultations\r\nforeseen in paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution\r\n48/264, which, in essence, are closely linked to this\r\nsubject.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nI would prefer not to repeat the elements that, as my\r\ndelegation has pointed out over the past few years, should\r\nbe included in the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Nevertheless, it is worth recalling that\r\nthat report should not only include references to the official\r\ndocuments considered by the Council and those adopted by\r\nit, but also, and even more importantly, it should include an\r\nanalytical summary of the discussions held in the so-called\r\ninformal consultations of the whole, which the Council’s\r\npresent inadequate practice have transformed into its true\r\ndebates.\r\nIn this connection, the report should also duly reflect\r\nthe frequent oral reports to the Council by high Secretariat\r\nofficials and the letters exchanged between the President of\r\nthe Security Council and the Secretary-General, when those\r\nare not published as official documents of the United\r\nNations, and it should include a report on the activities of\r\nthe subsidiary organs of the Council, which are also of the\r\nutmost interest to the Members of the Organization.\r\nAt the same time the report’s structure should be made\r\nmore functional and be adapted to the new analytical\r\ncontent we are advocating. This would be our only means\r\nof determining what the real activities of the Council have\r\nbeen during the year or of being able evaluate, albeit in a\r\nsummary manner, the results of those activities in political\r\nterms.\r\nWe urge the Members of the Organization to consider\r\nthis issue seriously as a first step towards the pressing and\r\nnecessary reform of the Security Council, along with the\r\nrestoration of equitable geographical distribution in the\r\nCouncil’s membership and an increase in its numbers.\r\nFailure to do so would be tantamount to ignoring our\r\nresponsibilities as Members of the United Nations. If the\r\nCouncil cannot by itself modify substantially the manner in\r\nwhich it reports to the General Assembly so as to meet the\r\nwishes of the Organization’s membership as a whole, the\r\nGeneral Assembly should be prepared, sooner rather than\r\nlater, to make the necessary recommendations to that effect.\r\nMr. Biegman (Netherlands): I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Security Council for his presentation of the\r\nannual report of the Council to the General Assembly.\r\nThe report is testimony to the dramatically increased\r\nactivities of the Council in recent years. It gives a clear\r\nindication of its heavy and ever-increasing workload, and\r\nmy delegation wishes to take this opportunity to express its\r\nappreciation for the dedication and hard work of the\r\nmembers of the Council.\r\nOnce again, the report is purely enumerative and\r\ndescriptive in nature. The question arises of whether this\r\nis still the appropriate format for the annual report of a\r\nbody that is at present fulfilling such a pivotal role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIt should not be forgotten — and many speakers\r\nhave said this already — that the Council is fulfilling this\r\nrole on behalf of the entire membership of the\r\nOrganization, as provided in Article 24 of the Charter. It\r\nis here that the legitimacy of the Council’s actions is\r\nanchored. But from that Article of the Charter it also\r\nflows that the general membership is entitled to be\r\ninformed about the way in which the Council is fulfilling\r\nits responsibilities. My delegation holds the view that,\r\nagainst the background of the Council’s increased\r\nresponsibilities, the general membership is entitled to\r\nreceive a different kind of report than the one we now\r\nhave before us.\r\nI fully realize the difficulties involved in producing\r\na report that is of a more analytical character. I am not\r\nadvocating that an extensive account should be given of\r\nall the aspects of the negotiations in the informal\r\nconsultations in the Security Council. Informal\r\nconsultations are useful, necessary and indispensable for\r\nthe effectiveness of the work of the Council.\r\nAt the same time, it is necessary to enhance the\r\ntransparency of the work of the Council. More than ever\r\nbefore, the Member States are actively involved in peace-\r\nkeeping operations around the world mandated by the\r\nSecurity Council. It is therefore logical that, more than\r\never before, Member States feel the need to be involved\r\nin the Council’s decision-making process.\r\nThe flow of information between the Council and\r\nthe membership at large has to be improved. The annual\r\nreport is one of the channels that can be used for this\r\npurpose. In this light, the present format of the annual\r\nreport does not seem appropriate any more.\r\nThe United Nations finds itself at present in a\r\ntransitional phase, seeking a new identity in a new and\r\ncomplex international context. The Organization is trying\r\nto redefine its role in responding to the many challenges\r\nit is facing. Especially in the field of peace-keeping, the\r\nUnited Nations has learned important lessons in the recent\r\npast.\r\nHowever, in the report of the Council, which is the\r\nonly body competent to authorize such operations, no\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nmention is made of positive or negative experiences on the\r\nbasis of the activities of the past year. I cannot imagine that\r\nthe Council has not drawn some conclusions from what has\r\nhappened in Somalia, Bosnia and Rwanda. Why, then, are\r\nthe benefits of that experience not shared with the\r\nnon-members of the Council? It seems hardly necessary to\r\nmention in this regard the special interest of countries that\r\nare providing troops to peace-keeping operations. I noted\r\nwith great interest that the President of the Security Council\r\nannounced yesterday that the Council had made some\r\nheadway with respect to the proposal made by Argentina\r\nand New Zealand, and I am very much looking forward to\r\nseeing the result.\r\nAt any rate, it seems to me that a special chapter in\r\nthe report dedicated to an evaluation of the experiences of\r\nthe past year would be a welcome enrichment of the\r\npresent format, a sort of chapter on lessons learned. If the\r\nOrganization wants to be responsible, credible and\r\nsuccessful, it is of paramount importance that we try to\r\nlearn as much from our failures as from our successes. It is\r\nnot acceptable that a body which is given such tremendous\r\npower and responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security should render account by\r\nway of a simple list of its activities during the past year.\r\nNo organization in which powers of this magnitude are\r\ndelegated to a select body would be content with a purely\r\nfactual annual report.\r\nBefore closing, let me assure the Assembly that my\r\ncritical remarks made here today about the report are in no\r\nway meant to infringe the competence and prerogatives of\r\nthe Security Council. My suggestions and comments should\r\nbe seen as an effort to contribute to an enhancement of the\r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness of the decisions of the Council,\r\nin whose important role we continue to believe.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): The Security Council has once again\r\nproduced for the General Assembly a report with a long\r\nand detailed list of its activities between June 1993 and\r\nJune 1994. From the report, the volume of the Council’s\r\nwork in the interest of the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security appears particularly impressive.\r\nHowever, in terms of quality, I am afraid I must note\r\nonce again, as in previous years, the purely descriptive\r\nnature of the document. One should not forget that this\r\nreport constitutes the main formal link between two bodies\r\nof vital importance to the United Nations system. The need\r\nto redefine and invigorate relations between the Council and\r\nthe General Assembly, which is the embodiment of the\r\nUnited Nations general membership, has been repeatedly\r\nemphasized by my country and by almost all others\r\nduring the exercise currently under way for the reform of\r\nthe Security Council. Indeed, greater democratization of\r\nthe United Nations is widely considered both necessary\r\nand urgent.\r\nOne of the various proposals for reform is to infuse\r\nnew life into this type of annual report by eliminating\r\nsome of its ritual, bureaucratic verbiage and enriching it\r\ninstead with an assessment of the substantial problems\r\nthat the Security Council must face. My delegation fully\r\nsupports this proposal. Only in this way can the General\r\nAssembly, which elects two thirds of the Security\r\nCouncil’s members, gain a more concrete and accurate\r\nidea of the Council’s activities.\r\nWe would also like this report to be accompanied by\r\nother instruments and mechanisms that would make\r\nrelations between the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil closer and more organic. Various proposals to\r\nthis end have been advanced during the debate on the\r\nreform of the Security Council. Examples include the\r\nestablishment of periodic meetings between the Presidents\r\nof the two bodies or the creation of a shared subsidiary\r\nbody. We believe that these proposals should be examined\r\nin depth since a more efficient and fruitful collaboration\r\nbetween the two bodies would provide the fundamental\r\npremise for guaranteeing the entire United Nations\r\nmembership a greater sense of participation in the work\r\nof the Council.\r\nWe feel that one step in the right direction was taken\r\nby last month’s President of the Security Council, Sir\r\nDavid Hannay, when he held a briefing on October 27 for\r\nall the Missions not represented on the Security Council.\r\nThe response was warm, and 70 or so countries showed\r\nup. We applaud this initiative and look forward to\r\nbriefings by future Presidents. This should become\r\nestablished practice. The participation of the greatest\r\npossible number of Member States should be encouraged.\r\nTo this end, we take the liberty of suggesting that\r\nsuch briefings by the President of the Security Council be\r\nheld regularly on a certain day of the week — possibly at\r\nthe same time and place — and that they be announced\r\nin the United Nations Journal. We should not forget that\r\nmany of the improvements in the Organization have come\r\nabout not through Charter revisions but through changes\r\nin practice. This is the road we should continue to follow.\r\nFinally, I want, like other representatives who have\r\nspoken, to underline another step that might be taken.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nThis was illustrated just a few minutes ago by our\r\ncolleague the representative of New Zealand. I refer to the\r\nestablishment of a mechanism for the Council to hold\r\nregular and thorough consultations with countries\r\ncontributing troops to peace-keeping operations. In this\r\nlight, we very much welcome the joint proposal by\r\nArgentina and New Zealand. This has already received the\r\nopen support of many Member States, and it deserves an\r\nin-depth examination and a concrete follow-up by the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Bivero (Venezuela) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe report of the Security Council is one of the most\r\nimportant documents that the General Assembly has before\r\nit. As the Secretary-General points out in his report,\r\n“The vastly enhanced activities of the Security\r\nCouncil have generated a justifiable interest ... among\r\nthe Member States ... and the international\r\ncommunity”,\r\nwho are demanding\r\n“more transparency in the working methods”. (A/49/1,\r\npara. 30)\r\nNotwithstanding this acknowledgement, one can only\r\nconclude that over the past year only marginal progress has\r\nbeen made in the relationship between the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly or between the Council and\r\nMember States with regard to procedures governing\r\ninformation, consultation, transparency and predictability.\r\nAs a reference document the report is invaluable to\r\nMember States, but it is of lesser usefulness for the purpose\r\nof assessing the conflicts dealt with by the Council, the\r\ninterests at stake in those conflicts and the merit of\r\nmeasures adopted by the Council to resolve them. Anyone\r\nwanting an overall picture of a given crisis and of the\r\nstrategy adopted to resolve it would have to consult the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on a case-by-case basis.\r\nAn overall analysis of the activities of the\r\nOrganization through its various bodies continues to be\r\nnecessary. The present approach is piecemeal; it has not yet\r\nbeen structured. The report that we are considering today is\r\nbut one piece — indeed, an unrelated piece — of the\r\nwhole.\r\nThe importance of the process and the methodology of\r\ninformation is relevant not only because of the very nature\r\nof the items concerning the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Given the exponential growth in\r\nexpenditures on peace-keeping operations, each\r\nGovernment must have a thorough knowledge of the\r\norigin of and the justification for the commitments\r\nimposed on it by the Council and must be in a position to\r\nmake a better assessment of its possible contribution to\r\nthe collective efforts that are advocated. This applies in\r\nparticular to countries that are troop-contributors.\r\nVenezuela considers it necessary to continue to\r\nexplore options to improve the situation. We are in favour\r\nof achieving greater and better interaction between all the\r\ncompetent organs in the area of international peace and\r\nsecurity by parallel and mutually complementary means.\r\nFirst, there must be an increase in the number of\r\nmembers of the Security Council. Secondly, the\r\nprocedures governing information and consultations must\r\nbe improved. Our objective is to encourage a working\r\nrelationship that produces better communication and\r\ncoordination between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council and ensures that each body fully respects\r\nthe jurisdiction of the other.\r\nIn this context, we have welcomed the progress that\r\nhas been made in the sphere of the Council’s\r\ndocumentation and related issues; this is dealt with in\r\nchapter 28 of the report. At the same time, we should like\r\nto see similar progress in any direction that would\r\nfacilitate the tasks of the General Assembly, whose\r\npowers under Articles 10, 15 and 24 of the Charter do not\r\nrequire confirmation in respect of either matters of\r\nsubstance or matters of procedure. Ultimately, however,\r\nsuch progress depends on the Council’s authorizing the\r\nSecretary-General to provide information more frequently\r\nto the Council, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article\r\n12 of the Charter.\r\nVenezuela favours greater use of special reports,\r\nwhich are particularly justifiable in the case of matters\r\nconsidered under Chapter VII of the Charter, and the\r\nproduction of ordinary reports at intervals that are more\r\nin tune with the dynamics of the Council’s activities.\r\nMr. Mwaungulu (Malawi), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe annual report could be subdivided into semester\r\nsections. Thus it would be closer to the activities being\r\nreported upon. In addition, its contents should be more\r\nanalytical, as has been said repeatedly in this Hall. Closer\r\nfollow-up to the activities of the Council, to reports by\r\nthe Secretary-General, to consultations and plenary\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nmeetings, to resolut ions adopted and to\r\ncommunications exchanged would certainly lead to a fuller\r\nunderstanding of the Security Council’s work and of how\r\nit is discharging its obligations. However, all that we have\r\nat present is not an institutional perception but the\r\nsubjective assessment of each Member State that has been\r\nbent on following up. We also see with increasing\r\nfrequency the political complexities of a given situation\r\nfalling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Council and\r\nbeing dealt with only in a supplementary way by the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its subsidiary bodies. All Member\r\nStates must take a position and must contribute to solutions.\r\nFor both reasons, we consider that the work of the Council\r\nand of the General Assembly would be facilitated by more\r\ncomprehensive and analytical documentation and by more\r\nflexible consultation procedures. Resolution 48/264 might\r\nbe the basis for work in both these directions.\r\nThe report that is being considered by the General\r\nAssembly covers part of the period during which Venezuela\r\nhad the responsibility of being a member of the Security\r\nCouncil. My delegation has no comment to make on the\r\nreport’s content in respect of matters in the consideration of\r\nwhich we participated. However, we should like to repeat\r\nthat consideration of these matters would have been more\r\nuseful if it had taken place a year ago, and our work in the\r\nCouncil would have been enriched by more dynamic\r\nrelations between the Council and the General Assembly.\r\nDuring the period of our membership we advocated\r\nregular consultations and exchanges of views with regional\r\ngroups and States concerned. From our own experience we\r\ncan say that the Council’s work would have benefited\r\nsubstantively and operationally. For this reason we are\r\nconvinced of the virtue of transparency and of constructive\r\ninteraction. We are confident that the methods of work and\r\nprocedures of, and the submission of reports by, the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly will develop in\r\nthe direction of achieving these goals.\r\nMr. Pashovski (Bulgaria): I should like, at the outset,\r\nto thank Sir David Hannay, who occupied the presidency of\r\nthe Security Council during the month of October, for his\r\nvery helpful presentation of this report to the General\r\nAssembly. We appreciate his efforts to contribute to the\r\nrecent commendable trend, in the functioning of the\r\nCouncil, towards greater transparency and concern for the\r\ninterests of States that are not members of the Council.\r\nMy country would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress its high esteem for the delegations of all the\r\nStates — both permanent and non-permanent members —\r\nthat have served on the Security Council in the past year\r\nfor their commitment and dedication. Our thanks go also\r\nto the Chairmen of the sanctions Committees, who have\r\nworked diligently and assiduously, often under great\r\npressure and in extraordinary circumstances.\r\nThe views of my country on the work of the\r\nSecurity Council and on issues of special interest to us\r\nhave been expressed on a number of occasions, most\r\nrecently in the general debate and in discussions that have\r\nbegun both in plenary and in the Committees. It is\r\ntherefore my intention to try to make this statement as\r\nconcise as possible. Allow me therefore to focus on some\r\nideas and specific proposals pertinent to the functioning\r\nof the Council which, we believe, would improve its\r\nefficiency and the transparency of its work.\r\nIn the effort to achieve greater openness and\r\ntransparency in the work of the Council we welcome the\r\nsteps undertaken over the past year to provide information\r\nto non-member States on a regular basis. Let me note, in\r\nthis connection, the decision by the Council to make\r\navailable the tentative forecast of its monthly programme\r\nof work as well as draft resolutions in their provisional\r\nform. We also welcome the practice, recently introduced\r\nby the Presidency, of holding periodic informal briefings\r\non the current work of the Security Council.\r\nIn our opinion, further measures in this direction\r\ncould include regular and/or ad hoc operative briefings on\r\nthe deliberations at meetings of the sanctions committees;\r\nthe introduction of the practice of open meetings of the\r\nCouncil’s sanctions committees or participation in\r\nmeetings of these committees by States concerned, as\r\nobservers, whenever such participation is warranted by\r\nthe discussion of issues of vital importance for them; and\r\nmeasures to provide improved and more timely access of\r\ninterested States to documents of the sanctions\r\ncommittees, as appropriate.\r\nThe need for consultations with States that are not\r\nmembers of the Council but that are directly concerned is\r\nmost strongly felt when economic sanctions and other\r\nsimilar preventive and enforcement measures are\r\nconsidered. We note steps taken in this direction during\r\nthe past year, in particular concerning applications made\r\nunder Article 50 of the Charter, as a consequence of the\r\nimplementation of the sanctions imposed against the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, which are listed under chapter 2 B of\r\npart I of the report.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nWe think that, in addition, this process should include\r\nadvance complex evaluations of any negative effects on the\r\neconomies of neighbouring countries and the definition of\r\nways and means of dealing with such unfavourable effects;\r\nand devising an institutionalized mechanism for assisting\r\nthose countries in their difficult situation. Regular\r\nconsultations with troop contributors and other States\r\nconcerned should also be institutionalized as a component\r\nof the decision-making process on peace-keeping\r\noperations, especially when the Council considers changes\r\nin their mandates and composition. We think also that the\r\ntrend towards a more active contribution by regional\r\norganizations should be further expanded through\r\nappropriate consultative arrangements.\r\nIn conclusion, let me express my hope that the\r\nsuggestions I have made will prove useful in our common\r\nendeavour to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of\r\nthe Security Council in the fulfilment of its highly\r\nimportant mission with regard to the complex problems\r\nfacing the world today.\r\nMr. Gambari (Nigeria): Let me begin by associating\r\nmy delegation with the statement made by the President of\r\nthe Security Council, the Permanent Representative of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Sir David Hannay, in introducing the\r\nannual report of the Security Council for the period 16 June\r\n1993 to 15 June 1994, contained in document A/49/2.\r\nNigeria welcomes the improvement, not only in the\r\nformat of the report, but also in its presentation. We note\r\nalso, in the context of the report, indications as to changes\r\nthat need to take place in the working methods and\r\nprocedures of the Council in order to provide for enhanced\r\ninteraction and consultation between members of the\r\nSecurity Council and States Members of the Organization.\r\nMy delegation had welcomed the establishment by the\r\nCouncil, in June 1993, of an informal working group on\r\ndocumentation and other procedural matters. That group\r\nmet regularly in the course of the year covered in the report\r\nto consider ways of improving the Council’s working\r\nprocedures. The measures which resulted from those such\r\nendeavours have been useful, although there is room for\r\nsubstantive improvement. For example, the initiative\r\ncurrently under discussion as to how best to brief Member\r\nStates on the progress or outcome of the Council’s informal\r\nconsultations is a welcome development and one which my\r\ndelegation fully supports. We hope that other members of\r\nthe Council will continue to support it.\r\nDuring my delegation’s statement in the general\r\ndebate on the question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters, we indicated that the restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council should be undertaken in a holistic\r\nmanner rather than piecemeal. We stressed that these\r\nreforms must take due account of the Council’s working\r\nmethods, including especially the issue of transparency. In\r\nthis regard, the recent initiative of the delegations of\r\nArgentina and New Zealand with a view to creating a\r\nmore effective system of consultation between Security\r\nCouncil members on the one hand and troop-contributing\r\ncountries on the other provides a useful contribution\r\nagainst the backdrop of the increasing complexities and\r\ndemands of United Nations peace-keeping operations. As\r\na major troop-contributing country, Nigeria takes the view\r\nthat consultations between troop contributors and the\r\nSecurity Council are not only desirable but necessary for\r\nthe full discharge of the obligations under the Charter. It\r\nis important however that the mechanism for such\r\nconsultations be fashioned in a manner which enhances\r\nrather than blurs the respective roles of the existing\r\norgans of the United Nations system involved in peace-\r\nkeeping operations.\r\nThe decision to make available to all Member States\r\nthe tentative forecasts of the programme of work of the\r\nSecurity Council each month, with annexes of reports by\r\nthe Secretary-General has considerably enhanced the\r\nCouncil’s efforts to achieve greater transparency. Further\r\nimprovements in this direction would be very welcome.\r\nMy delegation is impressed by the volume and scope\r\nof work, evident from the report, which the Council had\r\nundertaken in the past year in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, which is its primary\r\nresponsibility. It is significant to note, for instance, that\r\nthe Council adopted 87 resolutions and issued 68\r\nstatements by the President covering conflict areas and\r\nrelated issues. No doubt, the scope of this work reflects\r\nthe changed circumstances of the international post-cold-\r\nwar situation, which has enabled our Organization to\r\nbegin to play the role and to fulfil the expectations\r\nenvisaged for it by the founding fathers.\r\nPeace-keeping has become the critical concern of our\r\ntime, and rightly so. Out of the several peace-keeping\r\noperations currently being undertaken by the Security\r\nCouncil, unfortunately a preponderant number of them\r\nhappen to be located in our continent, Africa. The sober\r\nreality of the increase in the number of conflicts and their\r\nlocation reflects the depth of the political problems facing\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nthe affected regions and the level of the prevailing\r\ndevelopmental crisis. They underline the intrinsic linkages\r\nbetween peace and development and remind all of us that\r\na renewed global commitment to both is the best way\r\nforward.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to reiterate its\r\nfirm belief that the Security Council can only maintain and\r\nenhance its credibility, its legitimacy and its effectiveness\r\nif it adopts processes that are both democratic and\r\ntransparent. We therefore urge the Security Council to\r\nintensify efforts in this direction.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform delegations\r\nthat, as announced yesterday, the Assembly will consider\r\nagenda item 39, “The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina”,\r\non Thursday, 3 November 1994 in the morning instead of\r\non Wednesday, 2 November 1994 as previously scheduled.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/49/2)\r\nMr. Ould Ely (Mauritania) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The presentation and consideration of the report of\r\nthe Security Council has in recent years become one of the\r\nhigh points in our work. The renewed interest in this report\r\nis merely the reflection of the profound changes that have\r\noccurred in international affairs which have led to the\r\nexpansion of the activities of this central body of the United\r\nNations system, and thus to more frequent decisions on\r\nsubjects of major concern.\r\nThe overriding role played by the Security Council in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security has,\r\nquite rightly, made it a body in the activities of which all\r\nStates are rightly interested, hence the importance they\r\nattach to its work, functioning and working methods. It is\r\nalso why the annual reports of this body submitted pursuant\r\nto paragraph 3 of Article 24 of the Charter are of great\r\ninterest for all States, in particular for those that do not\r\nhave sufficient human or material resources systematically\r\nto follow all the subjects dealt with by the Council.\r\nThe delegation of Mauritania fully agrees with the\r\nviews expressed by the Ambassador of Indonesia speaking\r\nas current Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nOur previous debates on this question stressed the\r\nneed to change the present descriptive style of the report\r\nand to make it a document containing analysis and\r\nevaluation where all Member States could find\r\ninformation that would enable them better to understand\r\nthe fine details of decisions that they are required to\r\nimplement.\r\nActing on this request is particularly crucial since\r\nwith the increase in the items dealt with it is essential to\r\ngive States the means to make a positive contribution to\r\nthe decision-making process and to participate in all the\r\npreparatory stages. That is why my country supports\r\nefforts to expand the membership of the Security Council\r\nto make it reflect the current realities of our world as well\r\nas the prevailing sensitivities we find in it. That is also\r\nwhy we would like to see the flow of information\r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly become\r\nan ongoing process and we think that the Charter\r\nprovisions here should be applied more systematically.\r\nThe crucial role of the Security Council in the\r\npreservation of international peace and security makes it\r\na body whose decisions have important ramifications in\r\nvarious areas of activity. That is why the way it functions\r\nand acts is a matter of great importance. Here we\r\nwelcome the new unity of action we have witnessed in\r\nthe Council in recent years, just as we welcome recent\r\nefforts to submit reports within agreed deadlines.\r\nFinally, we hope that the current negotiations\r\nseeking to bring about the changes we wish to see, with\r\nregard to the composition of the Council and its working\r\nmethods, will continue. The commemoration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary should encourage us to redouble our\r\nefforts so that we can face the future with an instrument\r\nthat is capable of meeting the challenges and\r\nopportunities ahead.\r\nMr. Owada (Japan): At the outset I wish to express\r\nthe gratitude of the delegation of Japan to the Secretariat\r\nfor preparing this report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the period from 16 June 1993 to 15\r\nJune 1994. Japan was a member of the Council during the\r\nfirst half of that period. The report is a useful document\r\nconsisting in large part of a compilation of the relevant\r\ndocuments and materials on all subjects that the Council\r\naddressed in the course of the year. My delegation notes\r\nin particular that during that time, the Council held\r\n153 formal meetings, adopted 187 resolutions, and issued\r\n68 presidential statements. We note with great interest\r\nthat this level of activity is a clear reflection of the\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nimportant role the Security Council is playing in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. As the\r\nworld is moving into a new era after the demise of the cold\r\nwar, there is no question that the Security Council is\r\nexpected to play a central role in consolidating the\r\ninternational order in this new international environment. It\r\nis precisely from this perspective that Japan has been\r\nstressing the importance of enhancing the legitimacy and\r\ncredibility of the Council by improving its functioning.\r\nJapan will continue to contribute to the work of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nAs my delegation emphasized during the debate on the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, the need to reform the\r\norganization of the Council and the need to reform its\r\nfunctioning are the two issues which together form the\r\nbasis of an overall plan to reform the Security Council.\r\nThey should therefore be examined concurrently. It is\r\nhoped that agreement will be reached on both of them as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nIn the context of the present agenda item, Japan\r\nstrongly supports measures to achieve greater transparency\r\nin the work of the Security Council. As a member of the\r\nCouncil, Japan worked actively towards this end,\r\nparticularly through the working group on procedural\r\nmatters. In addition, when Japan served as President of the\r\nCouncil in 1993 it engaged in more than 60 bilateral\r\nconsultations in an effort to expand communication between\r\nmembers of the Council and non-members.\r\nOn this score, a number of proposals have been\r\nsubmitted, including a few by my own delegation, to make\r\ninformation on Security Council activities, particularly on\r\nthe progress of its informal consultations, more readily\r\navailable to United Nations Member States.\r\nWe are gratified to note that the Council itself has\r\nbeen making efforts and taking appropriate action in this\r\ndirection. As described in the report, in July 1993 the\r\nCouncil decided to make available to all United Nations\r\nMember States a tentative forecast of the programme of its\r\nwork for each month. Also, in March 1994 it decided that\r\nthe draft resolutions in their provisional form would be\r\nmade available to States which are not members of the\r\nCouncil. These new measures have surely been helpful in\r\nimproving the transparency of the Council’s work.\r\nMoreover, we understand that the Council has recently\r\nintroduced a new system of periodic briefings to be made\r\nby the delegation which holds the presidency on the\r\ndiscussions conducted in the consultations of the whole.\r\nThis new initiative is consonant with a suggestion that my\r\ndelegation put forward, and one that we heartily welcome.\r\nIn order to enhance the legitimacy and credibility of\r\nthe Council, it is important that the two-way flow of\r\ninformation between the Council and United Nations\r\nMember States be improved. This, in turn, will contribute\r\nto a more effective functioning of the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation has joined others in suggesting that a\r\nmechanism should be established for consultations on\r\npeace-keeping operations between the Security Council\r\nand the countries concerned, including those that make\r\nmajor contributions of funding and troops, as well as\r\nother interested countries. We note that some\r\nimprovement has been made in this regard by ensuring\r\ninteraction on major peace-keeping operations through\r\nmeetings between the Council and troop-contributing\r\ncountries, enabling both sides to better understand the\r\nviews and concerns of the other.\r\nWe also stress the importance of improving relations\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly,\r\nand of ensuring that the views of the latter body are\r\nreflected in the deliberations of the Council.\r\nIn closing, let me once again express my\r\ndelegation’s gratitude to the Security Council for its\r\nefforts to enhance the transparency of its activities. We\r\nhope the Council will continue those efforts while paying\r\ndue regard to the need to maintain efficiency in its work.\r\nMr. Cardenas (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Today, once again, we are speaking in a debate\r\nin the General Assembly on the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly. The report this time\r\ncovers the period from June 1993 to June 1994. This is a\r\ncontinuation of a welcome practice, which was begun in\r\n1990 by the delegations of Colombia, Cuba and Malaysia.\r\nThis practice has made possible a beneficial dialogue\r\nbetween two United Nations organs, the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, in accordance with\r\nthe express provisions of Article 24, paragraph 3, of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nIn this context, we would like to give special thanks\r\nto the delegation of the United Kingdom for introducing\r\nthis report to the Assembly and for continuing the\r\napproach taken by the delegation of Brazil last year, that\r\nis, adopting the report in a formal meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nThe delegation of Argentina has once again had the\r\nresponsibility of being a member of the Security Council\r\nsince the beginning of this year, and has been and is most\r\nactively interested in all matters pertaining to international\r\npeace and security. That is because the question of\r\ninternational peace and security is of such magnitude that\r\ncomplacency in this matter is out of the question.\r\nArgentina’s commitment to these activities is as clear\r\nas it is concrete, as we assume what we consider to be one\r\nof the most serious responsibilities for Member States that\r\nderives from the Charter.\r\nArgentina’s interest in these problems has been shown\r\nnot only in our ongoing participation in the debates in the\r\nvarious United Nations forums, but also in our having\r\ncontributed 1,600 Blue Helmets from Argentina who are\r\ncurrently engaged in nine peace-keeping operations\r\nthroughout the world. The significant contribution of\r\nArgentina is proof of Argentina’s commitment to\r\ninternational peace and security. We would add that, when\r\nit has been necessary to restore peace, Argentina has\r\ncontributed with military units to United Nations efforts in\r\nconflicts between Iraq and Kuwait and, more recently, in\r\nHaiti, to whose democracy my delegation has always been\r\ncommitted.\r\nAlso within this framework can be found the various\r\nmeasures adopted by Argentina in the field of disarmament.\r\nFor example, in a bilateral framework with Brazil, we have\r\ntaken action for the utilization of nuclear energy for\r\npeaceful purposes; regionally, we have ratified the\r\nTlatelolco Treaty and, more broadly, we have participated\r\nin a moratorium on the sale of anti-personnel land-mines\r\nthat was decided on by the Government of Argentina.\r\nThe period covered by the report before us could be\r\nconsidered to be the most active in the entire history of the\r\nSecurity Council. During this period, 87 resolutions were\r\nadopted and 68 presidential statements issued. At the same\r\ntime, the Security Council met on over 400 occasions, if we\r\ninclude both the formal meetings and the plenary\r\nconsultations, not to mention the meetings of the Council’s\r\nsubsidiary bodies, which were also active, especially the\r\nseven sanctions committees.\r\nThe Council’s work focused on 19 conflicts, some of\r\nthem extremely complex and far-reaching. Eight of these\r\nwere located in Africa, four in Asia, four in Europe and\r\ntwo in the Americas. During the same period, the Council\r\noversaw 17 different peace-keeping operations involving\r\napproximately 75,000 personnel throughout the world. It\r\nalso addressed a number of other subjects falling within\r\nits competence, including arrangements regarding its\r\nprocedures and documentation.\r\nAs we said at the outset, this should serve as an\r\noccasion for the Members of the United Nations to\r\nengage in a dialogue with the members of the Security\r\nCouncil, whether permanent or non-permanent. In this\r\ncontext, the Argentine delegation feels that certain\r\nfundamental issues of the Council’s work during the\r\nperiod in question should be raised.\r\nAs to global matters, we would raise the following\r\nissues. It is unquestionably clear from the report that the\r\nSecurity Council and the entire United Nations machinery\r\nare today deeply involved in resolving those conflicts that\r\nthreaten peace and security. It is not yet clear, however,\r\nwhether the present balance in the international system is\r\nstable. In spite of this, we cannot very well wait for the\r\nsystem to reform itself or to adapt to whatever new\r\nbalance may emerge before we decide to act. The\r\nmagnitude of the problems, such as those in Rwanda and\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, to mention but these two, requires\r\nimmediate action by the Security Council.\r\nThe various mechanisms of the Secretariat are\r\nspeedily adapting to suit the new requirements. At the\r\nsame time, however, certain unwieldy restrictions remain,\r\narising from a lack of human and financial resources. One\r\ngets the impression, though, that resources do exist and\r\nthat what is really involved is an absence of commitment\r\nor political will on the part of some Member States, or of\r\nappropriate channels for dealing with or resolving the\r\nissues.\r\nThe Council, in turn, is making use of a series of\r\ninstruments provided for by the Charter, such as\r\neconomic sanctions. These require a thorough and\r\ninnovative analysis in terms of results and effects. In\r\nparticular, consideration must be given to the impact of\r\nthese sanctions on the weaker segments of societies upon\r\nwhich they are imposed. In certain cases, it is clear that\r\nthe sanctions can respond and be adapted to the objective\r\nsought; in others, certain doubts remain. These sanctions,\r\nthough, are an instrument without which resort to the use\r\nof force — which should be a matter of exception —\r\nwould be more frequent. That is why we need to assess\r\nthe way in which they are used without minimizing their\r\nimportance. In this context, we also believe that we must\r\ncontinue to try to implement, in a realistic but effective\r\nmanner, the provisions of Article 50 of the Charter.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nMost current conflicts addressed by the Council are\r\ninternal in nature. This is apparently at variance with the\r\nprinciple of non-intervention, but most of them, given their\r\nmilitary, humanitarian and refugee dimensions, also have\r\nserious regional repercussions. The Charter does not\r\nexplicitly address such cases. However, their consequences\r\non the humanitarian level are of such magnitude that, in\r\ntoday’s world, it is particularly difficult to justify the\r\ninternational community’s inaction.\r\nIn connection with the Security Council’s work, I\r\nshould like to point out the following. For a little more than\r\na year now, the Council has been working systematically on\r\nits procedures. To some extent, this has been in response to\r\ndemands by the general membership that have been heard\r\ntime and time again in various forums, but also in response\r\nto the Council’s own needs. Here, we would refer to the\r\nactivity of the Council’s Working Group on Documentation\r\nand Other Procedural Matters — which has suggested a\r\nwhole series of changes aimed at achieving greater\r\ntransparency in the Council’s work. An example of this\r\neffort is precisely the new format of the report before us, in\r\nwhich there remains room for improvement. Meetings are\r\nnow being announced in the Journal, which I recall was a\r\nproposal originally made by the delegation of Cuba. There\r\nhas also been a recent unofficial decision of the Council\r\nthat its President should report periodically to the general\r\nmembership on discussions held in informal consultations.\r\nI might mention the action recently taken by the United\r\nKingdom to promote this procedure.\r\nAnother demand that should be heeded is that for\r\ngreater communication between the Council and the general\r\nmembership in specific matters that call for it. This debate\r\nis a clear example of such communication, but there are\r\nother matters of equal importance. In this context, the\r\nCouncil, at the initiative of the delegation of New Zealand\r\nand my own, is at present working on the imminent\r\nimplementation of stable and predictable machinery that\r\nwill allow for a better flow of communication between\r\ntroop-contributing countries, members of the Council and\r\nthe Secretariat. We hope that significant progress will be\r\nmade on these matters in coming days; this will begin to\r\nrespond to a need frequently expressed by the Members of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nThe Council generally meets these days in informal\r\nmeetings that are not explicitly provided for in the Charter.\r\nIn spite of this, these meetings are clearly indispensable if\r\nthere is to be a fluid exchange of opinions and views\r\nenabling speedy and efficient decision-making.\r\nWe have already referred to the matter of\r\ntransparency and the relationship between the Council and\r\ntroop-contributing countries. Mention should also be made\r\nof the problem of parties to a conflict that are not\r\nmembers of the Council in making their voices heard or\r\nstating their positions clearly throughout the exchange of\r\ninformation and the decision-making process. These\r\ndifficulties can become particularly acute when one of the\r\nparties is a member of the Council. The Council must\r\naddress this issue explicitly in the future.\r\nHaving mentioned these specific problems, we\r\nshould like, lastly, to raise a more general issue, albeit\r\none which is related to what we have already discussed.\r\nI am referring to the differing perceptions that sometimes\r\narise between permanent and non-permanent members of\r\nthe Council regarding certain procedural matters. My\r\ndelegation believes that it would make the Council’s work\r\nmuch more efficient if each side made a genuine effort to\r\nunderstand the other’s point of view, within the context\r\nof paragraph 1 of Article 24 of the Charter.\r\nWe said at the outset that the work of the Council is\r\nextremely complex. We have therefore referred only to\r\nsome aspects of it which we feel require a greater\r\nexchange of opinion between the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council. This is a joint undertaking. The\r\nappropriate forums are already available, and it is possible\r\nto create any new channels of communication that may be\r\nconsidered necessary.\r\nIn this context, the Argentine delegation is working\r\nactively in the organization of the Summit meeting of the\r\nSecurity Council, proposed by the Secretary-General, over\r\nwhich we will preside in January 1995. We are sure that\r\nthis meeting will be an appropriate forum for discussing\r\nthe matters that we are reviewing today.\r\nFinally, what we are discussing here is of great\r\nsignificance. If we do not want any one country to have\r\nto take on the task of guaranteeing peace beyond its\r\nborders, we must perfect the collective machinery, letting\r\nit evolve in the light of experience and strengthening it on\r\nthe basis of cooperation.\r\nMr. Valencia Rodriguez (Ecuador) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): After decades of paralysis caused by the\r\nideological bloc confrontation, the increasing dynamism\r\nof the Security Council today and its decisive action in\r\ncertain conflicts over the past three years suggest that the\r\nprospects are better for the smooth functioning of the\r\ncollective security system established by the Charter. The\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nreport presented to us today, in compliance with Articles 15\r\nand 24 of the Charter, has special significance.\r\nMy comments, which complement those made by the\r\nChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which Ecuador\r\nis a member, will be preliminary, as my Government has\r\nnot had time in the few days since this report was\r\npublished to carry out an exhaustive analysis of such a\r\nvoluminous text. My delegation therefore supports the\r\nproposal by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nthat this matter be kept open on the agenda.\r\nThe basic objective of the presentation of the\r\nCouncil’s report is to enable the Members of the\r\nOrganization to assess the work done by the Council,\r\nrepresenting the entire membership, and to express their\r\nviews on how the mandate has been discharged.\r\nRegrettably, the text that we have been given does not\r\nmake it possible for us to carry out this important task.\r\nAs other delegations have said, both at this session\r\nand in past years, a mere compilation of resolutions and\r\npresidential declarations in the Council and a list of\r\ndocuments on various issues does not give enough\r\ninformation for the complete analysis that we need to carry\r\nout. The international community needs to know clearly\r\nwhat criteria were used to guide the Council during\r\nparticularly difficult times. The report, despite recent\r\nrequests, lacks the information that would enable us to\r\nunderstand the political and legal foundations for the\r\nCouncil’s taking a certain course.\r\nWe are living at a time when concepts are being\r\nredefined. Sovereignty, self-determination, security and\r\nsustainable human development are terms that are discussed\r\ntime and time again in various bodies in this Organization\r\nin attempts to clarify their significance and adapt our\r\nactions to changing realities. For that reason, while the\r\nbasic documents and principles of the United Nations\r\nremain in force, the international community must know the\r\nexact criteria followed by the body with primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, on behalf of the entire membership, when it takes\r\ndecisions.\r\nThe increased financial cost for States resulting from\r\nthe growing activities of the Security Council has become\r\nwell known over the past two years. Our peoples and\r\nGovernments have a right to know the exact reasons for\r\nthese new demands.\r\nEffective implementation of the collective security\r\nsystem should be based on the principles of universality\r\nand universal applicability. In order for the Security\r\nCouncil’s actions to be legitimate and credible, supported\r\nby the entire international community, it must be clear\r\nthat there is no selectivity in its actions. That clarity\r\ncannot be achieved by the kind of report that we have\r\nbefore us.\r\nThere has been criticism of lax interpretation of legal\r\nnorms. The Council has a tendency to use Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter frequently. There is a lack of clarity over\r\nwhat matters lead the Council to determine that there is\r\nor is not a threat to international peace and security.\r\nThere is a perception that the Council involves itself in\r\nmatters within the jurisdiction of the General Assembly\r\nand the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). For\r\nthese and other reasons, various delegations, including the\r\ndelegation of Ecuador, have suggested at various times\r\nthat we should consider establishing a mechanism of\r\nconstitutional control over this organ. This option, whose\r\npossible negative implications my Government is well\r\naware of, will acquire special relevance if the Security\r\nCouncil continues to present reports lacking any analysis\r\nof its actions or of the criteria used in its deliberations,\r\nespecially in informal meetings.\r\nThe serious challenges that face the international\r\ncommunity must be tackled with clear norms and a\r\nconsistent, responsible practice by all United Nations\r\nbodies. Many of the ideas expressed in this debate and in\r\nthe debates on equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council point in this\r\ndirection. Ecuador hopes that the members of the Council\r\nwill give due consideration to these questions so that the\r\nnext report makes it possible for us to view the work of\r\nour Organization with renewed optimism.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nProgramme of Work\r\nThe President: A tentative programme of work and\r\nschedule of plenary meetings for the months of November\r\nand December will be issued tomorrow morning in\r\ndocument A/INF/49/5/Add.2. This addendum supersedes\r\ndocument A/INF/49/5/Add.1. The list of speakers for the\r\nitems that were not already listed in document\r\nA/INF/49/5/Add.1 will be open tomorrow morning.\r\nI should like to point out that this schedule is being\r\nissued as early as possible in order to assist delegations in\r\nplanning their work. For its part, the Secretariat will\r\nendeavour to ensure that the relevant documentation is\r\navailable to delegations ahead of the discussion of any\r\ngiven agenda item. The scheduling of agenda items not\r\nreflected in document A/INF/49/5/Add.2 will be announced\r\nin due course. I will also keep the Assembly informed of\r\nany changes.\r\nFurther, I should like to inform members that the\r\nannouncement of voluntary contributions to the 1995\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations Relief and Works\r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East will take\r\nplace on Tuesday morning, 6 December.\r\nAs I mentioned to the Assembly earlier, I hope to\r\nfollow this schedule as closely as possible so that the\r\nAssembly can discharge its responsibilities in an orderly\r\nfashion. I therefore appeal to those representatives that wish\r\nto submit draft resolutions to do so sufficiently in advance\r\nof the date fixed for consideration of items to give\r\nmembers adequate time to examine them.\r\nI should also like to remind representatives that\r\nadditional time is needed for those draft resolutions\r\ninvolving changes in the programme of work or additional\r\nexpenditures, since these will require the preparation of a\r\nstatement of programme budget implications by the\r\nSecretary-General. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee\r\non Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth\r\nCommittee will need adequate time to review the\r\nprogramme budget implications of a draft resolution before\r\nit can be acted on by the Assembly.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/49/2)\r\nMr. Butler (Australia): Quite properly, the report of\r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly is the\r\noccasion for an important debate. As we take up that\r\ndebate this year, we all are aware that questions of\r\nexpansion of the Council, related and deeper issues, and\r\nissues shaping the future roles of the United Nations are\r\nbeing considered elsewhere, so our focus today is on the\r\nreport of the Council to the General Assembly for the\r\npast year.\r\nIt is our view that, if there is a central point to be\r\nmade from this report, we should acknowledge that in\r\nrecent years, there has been a growing and expressed\r\nconcern about the need to improve the briefing\r\nprocedures, working methods and practices of the\r\nSecurity Council. There have been many calls for\r\nimproved mechanisms for communication and\r\nconsultation between the overall membership of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council. It is right,\r\ntherefore, to ask, in the face of so many calls: What has\r\nhappened? What does this report reflect in answer to that\r\nquestion?\r\nMy delegation can say that there have been some\r\nimprovements. We see positive examples of instances in\r\nwhich the Security Council has listened to Member States\r\nand has sought to respond to calls for change.\r\nAccordingly, some initial steps have been taken by the\r\nCouncil to improve the transparency and accessibility of\r\nits deliberations. These have been constructive steps.\r\nIndeed, these efforts should be seen in the context of the\r\nunprecedented number of situations to which the Council\r\nis called upon to respond, and in the context of the\r\nincreasing frequency - indeed, the virtually continuous\r\nnature - of its deliberations.\r\nIn our view, it is simply courteous, as a consequence\r\nof these facts, to give recognition to the progress that has\r\nbeen made over the last year by the Council in adopting\r\nsome changes to its working methods. In that sense, the\r\nold principle that credit should be given where credit is\r\ndue should be applied on this occasion.\r\nWe hope that this positive experience will lend\r\nsupport to further and continuing efforts to reform the\r\npractices of the Council and to foster further improved\r\nmechanisms of communication between the Council,\r\nMember States and the General Assembly. Many\r\ndelegations have made the point that more is needed in\r\nthis respect.\r\nOne obvious example of where progress has\r\noccurred is in the availability and the substance of this\r\nyear’s report of the Security Council to the General\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nAssembly. To put it simply: last year’s report was\r\nextremely late; this year’s report is more timely.\r\nNow what can be said more specifically of this year’s\r\nreport? In its present form, it provides a useful and\r\ncomprehensive compendium of documents relevant to the\r\nSecurity Council deliberations and of action then taken by\r\nthe Council. As others have pointed out, this is certainly\r\nuseful and of academic interest. But it could be made more\r\nthan that, and there are many calls for it to contain a\r\ngreater degree of analysis, for it to move beyond being a\r\ndocument of record, no matter how precise or how full.\r\nThose calls should be addressed.\r\nIn addition, a new and significant chapter has been\r\nadded to part II of the report, entitled “Other matters\r\nconsidered by the Security Council”. Chapter 28 of the\r\nreport, entitled “Documentation of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters”, is clear and further evidence that the\r\nSecurity Council has given consideration, over the past\r\nyear, to how to improve some aspects of its working\r\nmethods and mechanisms for communicating its\r\ndeliberations to the General Assembly. My delegation\r\nwelcomes these developments, and we would strongly\r\nencourage further action in the same direction.\r\nBy comparison, however, we would call attention to\r\npart III of the report, dealing with the work of the Military\r\nStaff Committee. Last year’s report contained the following\r\nexplanation of the activities of the Military Staff\r\nCommittee:\r\n“The Military Staff Committee, established pursuant\r\nto Article 47 of the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nfunctioned continually under its draft rules of\r\nprocedure during the period under review. It held a\r\ntotal of 26 meetings and remained prepared to carry\r\nout the functions assigned to it under the terms of\r\nArticle 47”. (A/48/2, p. 421)\r\nThat is, at best, hardly a revealing statement. But what\r\nis truly fascinating about this year’s report is that precisely\r\nthe same statement is repeated under the heading, “Military\r\nStaff Committee”.\r\nIf all the report can tell Member States about the\r\nMilitary Staff Committee’s activities is that the Committee\r\nis prepared to carry out its functions, then we cannot be\r\nchastised for being too demanding when we ask ourselves\r\nhow to improve the functioning of the Military Staff\r\nCommittee and its relationship to the Council and to the\r\nwider purposes of the Charter.\r\nWe need to continue to address ongoing\r\nimprovements to the working methods of the Council. We\r\nshould look seriously at the proposals and suggestions\r\nalready offered by a number of Member States. An\r\noutstanding example is the proposal put to the Council by\r\nthe Permanent Representatives of New Zealand and\r\nArgentina, to be found in document S/1994/1063, which\r\ndeals with the need for consultations with interested\r\nStates, especially troop-contributing countries. Early and\r\npositive action should be taken on that proposal.\r\nIn our review of the report of the Council, this very\r\nimportant area of the life of our United Nations, it must\r\nbe remembered that, according to Article 24 of the\r\nCharter, the Security Council acts on behalf of Member\r\nStates — all of us. It therefore makes good sense for the\r\nCouncil to be responsive to the views of Member States\r\non its operations.\r\nLet it be clear: Article 24 clearly implies a two-way\r\nflow of information. More information should flow out of\r\nthe Security Council to the wider membership on all\r\naspects of the Council’s work, but there must also be a\r\nflow into the Council from the whole community it\r\nserves. The Council should be prepared to listen to,\r\nreceive and act upon such information, because its role as\r\nan effective body representative of us all demands no\r\nless.\r\nA key example of a procedural form that would be\r\neffective is the establishment of an early-warning system\r\nto draw the Council’s attention to emerging global crises\r\nand threats, military or non-military. It should be possible\r\nfor the Council to meet periodically to consider situations,\r\nin the words of Article 34 of the Charter,\r\n“which might lead to international friction or give\r\nrise to a dispute”.\r\nUnder such a reform, the Council could then look at\r\npotential problems not covered by the existing Council\r\nagenda. Matters for consideration could be determined by\r\nrelying on Articles 11, 12, 14, 52 and 99 of the Charter,\r\nas well as on the proposals of the Council and of Member\r\nStates. An early-warning procedure of this sort, on this or\r\nsimilar lines, would enable the Council to take action to\r\nassist the peaceful settlement of disputes before problems\r\nescalate into armed conflict or a complete breakdown of\r\nlaw and order. A truly modern Security Council would\r\nthen, in this sense, become much more involved in\r\npreventive diplomacy than ever before.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nI began by recalling that this is an important debate,\r\nnot merely the formal receipt of a report. Some 40 Member\r\nStates will have taken part in the debate before it has\r\nconcluded. Our earnest hope for the future health of the\r\nOrganization is that this debate is being heard.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): My delegation welcomes the\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly,\r\ncontained in document A/49/2. The report provides a\r\ncompendium of the Security Council’s activities during the\r\nlast reporting period, and also describes its tasks in the\r\ncontext of increasing new responsibilities. We also\r\nappreciate the response of the Council in implementing\r\nproposals relating to its working methods and procedures,\r\nincluding the inclusion of its provisional agenda in the\r\nJournal. It is my delegation’s view, however, that these\r\nmeasures do not go far enough in providing analytical\r\ninsight into the Council’s work, as the general membership\r\nof the United Nations would have liked to see. In this\r\nrespect, my delegation fully supports the views expressed\r\nearlier by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nUnder Article 24 of the Charter, Member States have\r\nconferred on the Security Council primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. This\r\nprovision is based on the understanding that in carrying out\r\nits tasks the Council acts on behalf of the membership as\r\na whole. Hence, the Council is called upon to act in a\r\nrepresentative manner. An appropriate mechanism for\r\nnon-members of the Council to contribute their views and\r\nshare information on the Council’s work would only foster\r\nthe democratic character of the Council and at the same\r\ntime enhance its effectiveness.\r\nWe believe that formal and informal meetings as well\r\nas informal consultations should take place to facilitate\r\nwider participation of Member States before the Security\r\nCouncil takes decisions. Troop-contributing countries\r\nnaturally have a vital interest in the assessment and analysis\r\nof a situation involving the establishment of peace-keeping\r\noperation and its extension or changes of its mandate.\r\nAs one of the significant troop-contributing countries,\r\nNepal is concerned about a clear mandate, a realistic time-\r\nframe and a correct assessment of the situation in peace-\r\nkeeping operations. The safety and security of personnel\r\ninvolved is an equally important concern for us. The report\r\nof the Council should therefore be able to present a clear\r\npicture to help the troop-contributors make their\r\ncommitments in an informed manner. Such information\r\nwould be useful to all Member States, but more so to those\r\nthat do not have the resources to make their own\r\nassessments on the ground or that cannot participate in\r\nthe deliberations of the Council.\r\nNepal welcomes the concept of arrangements for a\r\nUnited Nations stand-by force to meet the increasing\r\ndemands of peace-keeping operations. A more transparent\r\nmanner of operation in the Security Council would help\r\nensure further cooperation from Member States and elicit\r\na spontaneous response from them in this matter.\r\nMember States would also like to see the extent of\r\nthe involvement of regional organizations in peace-related\r\nactivities at the instance of the Security Council and their\r\nimpact in various parts of the globe. A periodic\r\ncomprehensive report presenting the achievements and\r\nproblems of peace-keeping operations would also be a\r\nwelcome development.\r\nThe prevailing collegial spirit in the Security Council\r\nis a welcome phenomenon. That spirit has enabled the\r\nCouncil to act rapidly and decisively on some issues in\r\nrecent years. There are important proposals, including\r\nthose in “An Agenda for Peace”, to enhance the mandate\r\nof the Council further, to enable it to meet new\r\nchallenges to international peace and security.\r\nTransparency in function and representativeness in\r\ncomposition are important if the Council is to fulfil our\r\nheightened expectations.\r\nWe are confident that further concrete measures by\r\nthe Security Council to address the concerns of Member\r\nStates will only strengthen its role in the maintenance of\r\npeace and security.\r\nMr. Talpur (Pakistan): I am pleased to have the\r\nopportunity to speak to the General Assembly on the\r\nreport (A/49/2) of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly covering the period from 16 June 1993 to 15\r\nJune 1994.\r\nAllow me first of all to welcome the timely\r\nsubmission of the report, which permits the General\r\nAssembly to consider it during the first part of its regular\r\nsession. My delegation would like to thank members of\r\nthe Secretariat for the hard work they put into preparing\r\nthe report.\r\nThe consideration of the Security Council’s report by\r\nthe General Assembly provides an important and\r\nprivileged occasion for the necessary interaction between\r\nthese two principal organs of the United Nations. This\r\nopportunity becomes all the more important in the light of\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nthe Security Council’s ever-increasing role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and the fact\r\nthat it is taking upon itself an increasing number of\r\nfunctions, some in hitherto-uncharted territories.\r\nWe are encouraged by the many improvements in the\r\nform and content of the present report, which takes into\r\naccount many constructive suggestions made in the past by\r\nseveral Member States. Indeed, the report reflects the work\r\ndone by the Council in responding to the problems related\r\nto the international peace and security. The voluminous\r\ncontent of the report is indicative of the need for continued\r\nattention and action by the United Nations to face the\r\nnumerous challenges persisting or emerging on the post-\r\ncold-war international scene, challenges which pose serious\r\nthreats to international peace and security.\r\nDespite several improvements, the content of the\r\nannual report of the Security Council needs to be improved\r\neven further. It remains basically a compilation of the\r\nvarious communications addressed to the Security Council\r\nand the decisions adopted by it. We would like to\r\nemphasize that the General Assembly, which is the body\r\nwith universal representation, must be thoroughly informed\r\nof the essence of the Security Council’s focus. Article 24\r\nof the Charter provides that Security Council acts on behalf\r\nof the Member States of the United Nations. The\r\nrepresentative character of the Security Council gives\r\nlegitimacy to its acts. The interaction between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly must, therefore, be\r\nstrengthened. The Security Council should also consider\r\npresenting the special reports provided for in Article 24 of\r\nthe Charter, owing to the Council’s ever-increasing\r\ninvolvement in diverse international situations.\r\nMy delegation is pleased that since its creation the\r\ninformal working group of the Security Council to consider\r\nsuggestions concerning documentation, including theannual\r\nreport and related matters, has achieved considerable\r\nresults. In this connection, one of the most useful results is\r\nthe availability to all Members of the United Nations of the\r\ntentative forecast of the Council’s programme of work for\r\neach month.\r\nWe are encouraged to note that the Council’s informal\r\nWorking Group is currently considering new ways to\r\nimprove the flow of information to non-members of the\r\nCouncil — a subject to which we attach a great deal of\r\nimportance. My delegation believes that there is an\r\nimperative need, not only to improve transparency in the\r\nmethods and procedures of the Security Council, but also\r\ntransparency in the relations between the Security Council\r\nand the rest of the membership of the General Assembly.\r\nThis would provide greater legitimacy to the Security\r\nCouncil’s actions and would strengthen the confidence of\r\nMember States in the actions of the Council.\r\nThe Security Council must be encouraged to discuss\r\nsubstantive issues in public meetings. Formal public\r\nmeetings should not be used merely to formalize\r\ndecisions previously made in informal consultations\r\nbehind closed doors. We would hope that the present\r\nemphasis on reform would lead to greater openness in the\r\nCouncil’s procedures. All reform efforts must be based on\r\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of all States,\r\nenhancing transparency and respect for democratic\r\nprinciples.\r\nMr. Tsepkala (Belarus)(interpretation from\r\nRussian): I should like first, on behalf of the delegation\r\nof the Republic of Belarus, to express our gratitude to the\r\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the\r\nUnited Nations, Ambassador David Hannay, for his\r\nintroduction of the report of the Security Council. Thanks\r\nto his statement, various aspects of the Council’s work,\r\nincluding the scope and complexity of its activities and its\r\nmodus operandi, have been clarified and highlighted, at\r\nleast in the view of my delegation.\r\nThere is no doubt that over the past year the\r\nSecurity Council has done an enormous amount of work.\r\nProof of that is the number of meetings and consultations\r\nthe Council has held, as well as the announcements made\r\nin the Journal. The Council has met on virtually a\r\npermanent basis because of the need to react to quickly\r\nchanging situations and to review various peace-keeping\r\noperations. Accordingly, a large amount of work has also\r\nfallen to the Secretariat offices that service the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe delegation of Belarus notes with satisfaction that\r\nthe working methods of the Security Council have\r\nrecently seen many changes for the better. In keeping\r\nwith the wishes of delegations to enhance transparency in\r\nthe Council’s work as expressed at past sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Journal regularly publishes a\r\ndetailed agenda of Council meetings. The Council’s draft\r\nreport is discussed and adopted by the Council in open\r\nsession. Through the publication of documents and the\r\nparticipation of Security Council members in press\r\nbriefings, as well as through consultations with the\r\nchairmen of regional groups, Member States receive more\r\ninformation about plans for the Council’s work as well as\r\nits actual activities.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nWe believe, nevertheless, that this information is\r\nsometimes insufficient with regard to certain questions,\r\nwhich again highlights the need to reform the Security\r\nCouncil. In our discussion of agenda item 33 my delegation\r\nstated its views on reforming that body. We would now like\r\nto stress the fact that the Security Council, pursuant to\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter, acts on behalf of all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations. That is precisely why it is\r\nassumed that decisions taken by the Council, whenever they\r\nrelate to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, are in consonance with the wishes and desires of\r\nall Member States, including those that are not members of\r\nthe Security Council. That is the very basis of Article 25 of\r\nthe Charter, pursuant to which\r\n“The Members of the United Nations agree to\r\naccept and carry out the decisions of the Security\r\nCouncil”.\r\nWe believe that situations about which decisions are\r\ntaken involving financial implications that run into many\r\nmillions of dollars and about which States find out after the\r\nfact should be completely eliminated from the Security\r\nCouncil’s current practice in the decision-making process.\r\nIt is precisely in such instances that consultations with\r\nStates that are not members of the Council could play a\r\nvery important role, perhaps through the Chairmen of the\r\nregional groups. As a result, the members of the Security\r\nCouncil would have absolute confidence that all aspects of\r\nresolving a given problem were agreed to by the\r\ninternational community and that the decision taken and its\r\nconsequences, including financial implications, would be\r\nsupported by, and would elicit a favourable response from,\r\nall States Members of the United Nations.\r\nThe delegation of Belarus would like to make a few\r\npoints about the format of the report before us. The\r\nintroduction to the Council’s report says it is a description\r\nof the work of the Security Council for the period under\r\nreview. In this connection, our delegation would like to\r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to the fact that, pursuant to\r\nArticle 15 of the Charter, reports of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly\r\n“shall include an account of the measures that the\r\nSecurity Council has decided upon or taken to\r\nmaintain international peace and security”.\r\nAs we understand it, the words “description” and “account”\r\nare not at all synonymous. We feel that a report should not\r\nbe restricted to a mere description of the facts. It should\r\ninclude an analysis of events described, conclusions should\r\nbe drawn and recommendations should be provided. In\r\nfact, this is something we see in practically all cases in\r\nwhich reports are submitted to the General Assembly by\r\norgans of the United Nations.\r\nThe desire of Member States to have an analytical\r\npart included in the text of the reports of the Security\r\nCouncil was repeatedly expressed at the last session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Unfortunately, that wish has gone\r\nunheeded so far. As we see it, the Security Council,\r\nacting on behalf of all States Members of the United\r\nNations, must give an account of itself to the General\r\nAssembly, and not just give it a description of its work.\r\nThat is the basis of the close relationship between the two\r\nprincipal bodies of the United Nations and may also be a\r\nguarantee that the Security Council will act in the interest\r\nof all States Members of the Organization.\r\nIn its present format, the report of the Council is a\r\nreasonably good reference document on the Council’s\r\nwork, though this comment does not apply to all parts of\r\nthe report. For example, Part III of the report, on the\r\nwork of the Military Staff Committee — which is, I\r\nbelieve, the briefest one — consists in the Russian\r\nversion of literally four and a half lines, and the\r\ninformation about the work of the Committee is limited\r\nto indicating that it functioned continually during the\r\nperiod under review and held a total of 26 meetings.\r\nIn our view, the next report of the Security Council,\r\nas an experiment, could be drawn up in a new format.\r\nThe report could consist of several interconnected parts,\r\nincluding a descriptive part, a section giving an analytical\r\naccount and a section on conclusions and\r\nrecommendations.\r\nMoreover, this year we were not entirely satisfied\r\nwith the timing of the reports’s publication. This 552-page\r\ndocument came out literally a day before the date initially\r\nplanned for its discussion in plenary. The deferral of the\r\ndiscussion of the question of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil from 26 October to 31 October took place for\r\ngood reason. We are grateful that delegations got more\r\ntime to study it, because it cannot be read in just one day,\r\nparticularly taking into account its length. While\r\nunderstanding that the preparation of the report in a new,\r\namended form and its timely publication could cause\r\nquite a few difficulties, we believe none the less that the\r\ndesires of Member States should be taken into account\r\nand heeded.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 1 November 1994\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in the\r\ndebate on this item.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of the\r\nreport of the Security Council contained in document\r\nA/49/2?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We have thus concluded this stage\r\nof our consideration of agenda item 11.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n20\r\n"
