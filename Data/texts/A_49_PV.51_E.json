(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Blandino Canto\r\n(Dominican Republic), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 112 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): In a\r\nletter contained in document A/49/400/Add.4 the Secretary-\r\nGeneral informs me that, since the issuance of his\r\ncommunications dated 20 and 26 September and 5 and 14\r\nOctober 1994, the Comoros has made the necessary\r\npayment to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in\r\nArticle 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 39 (continued)\r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina: draft\r\nresolution (A/49/L.14/Rev.1)\r\nMr. Eltinay (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic): The\r\nso-called new international order has spawned an assault\r\nthat targeted the cultural diversity of many States under the\r\nname of defending human rights. In the wake of the cold\r\nwar, as the international arena became empty of\r\nideological conflicts, certain countries, which have\r\nmonopolized world leadership filled that vacuum with\r\ndiscriminatory policies which they pursued through the\r\napplication of double standards and a marked reluctance\r\nto take the side of right and justice in areas where some\r\nwould clamour that human rights are being violated.\r\nIt has been the misfortune of the Bosnian Muslim\r\npeople that some have chosen to consider its existence\r\nthrough those double standards and through the absence\r\nof justice. As if this was not enough, the very existence\r\nof that people in a certain geographic context added to its\r\ndemerit in the eyes of those parties and, thereby, added to\r\nits misery. Thus the Bosnian people fell victim to cultural\r\nintolerance and became fair game to all kinds of\r\noppression and inhuman crimes such as “ethnic\r\ncleansing”, mass killing, rape and siege. At the same\r\ntime, it fell victim to the collusion and silence of those\r\nwho considered its continued existence an obstacle in the\r\nway of their grand design.\r\nPeople of good conscience who belong to the region\r\nthat applies those double standards have testified to the\r\ncollusion they have witnessed in the perpetration of those\r\ncrimes by describing the limited and hesitant intervention\r\nof the United Nations in Bosnia as too little too late\r\nqualifying it as an action that rewards the aggressor in the\r\nname of neutrality, while such neutrality has never been\r\nthe norm in any area where the conflicting parties\r\nbelonged to a different culture.\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nAlthough the resolutions adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil in condemning the Serbs and establishing “safe\r\nareas” and exclusion zones have been numerous indeed,\r\nsuch resolutions have lacked the necessary ingredient,\r\nnamely the political will of the major Powers and have\r\nfallen victim to the policy of double standards when it came\r\nto enforcing them. Even the establishment of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia has come up against the hurdle of\r\nfinancial difficulties. The recommendations of international\r\nmediation have tended to reward the aggressor with the\r\nterritories acquired through the use of force, regardless of\r\nthe fact that this runs counter to the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, the norms of international law and the\r\nresolutions of the United Nations.\r\nRegardless of the courageous decision by the Bosnian\r\nGovernment to accept the Contact Group’s plan of 30 July\r\n1994, the Serb aggressors have defied even their closest\r\nfriends and rejected the plan because of their awareness of\r\nthe impotence or collusion that makes them immune to the\r\nimposition of any such plan upon them. Even those who\r\nhave threatened to punish the Serb aggressors have been\r\npersuaded by their allies to turn a blind eye to the situation\r\nand to abandon any plans they might have had to deter the\r\naggressor by military means.\r\nThe credibility of the United Nations, and the Security\r\nCouncil in particular, has been laid bare by the Bosnian\r\nquestion. Security Council resolution 943 (1994) by\r\nproviding for a partial lifting of sanctions against Serbia\r\nand Montenegro has exposed the true intentions of those\r\nwhose voices are loudest in opposition whenever it is\r\nsuggested that the arms embargo against Bosnia might be\r\nlifted, regardless of the fact that imposing such an embargo\r\non Bosnia contravenes Article 51 of the Charter and the\r\nright to self-defence enshrined in that Article. The pretext\r\nof those who oppose the lifting of that embargo has\r\ncontinued to be the contention that the lifting would lead to\r\nescalating of the conflict, closing the door to any peaceful\r\nsettlement in addition to threatening the lives of the\r\ninternational peace-keeping personnel.\r\nThe war in Bosnia is not a civil war in the full sense\r\nof the word. There is an external party that helps the\r\naggressor. Serbia and Montenegro, an arms-producing State,\r\nhas been providing an unending flow of weapons and\r\nlogistical support to the Serbs. The deployment of 100\r\nUnited Nations observers on the borders of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina with Serbia and Montenegro does not, in any\r\nway, guarantee the stemming of that flow of arms to the\r\nSerbs across the borders. Therefore, lifting the arms\r\nembargo against Bosnia would give an impetus to the\r\npeace process by restoring some of the balance between\r\nthe aggressor and the victim, as highlighted by the recent\r\ndevelopments in Bosnia which demonstrate that the\r\nBosnian people is quite capable of repulsing aggression.\r\nIn order for the Bosnian people to repel the aggressor,\r\nthere must be an end to the collusion that enables the\r\nSerbs to carry out their designs which aim at\r\nexterminating the Bosnians and at physically removing\r\ntheir State from the map of Europe, even though it is a\r\nState Member of the United Nations whose sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity must be respected.\r\nThe international community represented in the\r\nGeneral Assembly should clearly and strongly condemn\r\nthe crimes of the Bosnian Serbs — their mass murders,\r\n“ethnic cleansing”, attacks against the “safe areas” and\r\nexclusion zones established by the United Nations,\r\nincluding Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Bijelina and other areas,\r\nas well as attacks on United Nations personnel. The\r\ninternational community should also stress its\r\ncommitment to stand by the behests of international\r\nlegality and not to side with the aggressor against the\r\nvictim.\r\nWhile we appreciate the significant efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations Protection Force and are anxious to ensure\r\nthe safety of its personnel, we believe that it should be\r\nstrengthened and empowered with the necessary\r\ncompetence in order for it to become a deterrent force\r\nthat would repel aggression rather than continuing to be\r\nsaddled with the neutral posture imposed on it by the\r\nSecurity Council. UNPROFOR should make greater\r\nefforts to protect the “safe areas” and exclusion zones\r\ndesignated by Security Council resolutions, as protection\r\nof those areas and enforcement of those zones lie within\r\nthe mandate of the Force, with full consideration for the\r\nright of the Bosnian people to repel aggression and to free\r\nits territories from the occupiers. The Bosnian people has\r\nin fact demonstrated its ability to do just that, with a great\r\ndeal of courage.\r\nWe call upon the Security Council to exercise its\r\ncompetence under Article 24 of the Charter. In so doing,\r\nthe Council should not be influenced by the strategies of\r\nsome of its members and should aim at achieving a just\r\nand lasting solution to the problem that does reward the\r\naggressor. This the Council should do through the\r\nimplementation of the principle of non-admissibility of\r\nthe annexation of territories by force and the principle of\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nthe right of refugees to return to their homes. We must\r\nmake it clear that failure to enforce the Security Council’s\r\nresolution, including that relating to the opening of Tuzla\r\nairport, would pose a definite threat to the lives of the\r\npopulation which are already threatened by lack of\r\nmedicine and food as a result of the Serb siege and their\r\nprevention of distribution of humanitarian assistance to\r\nSarajevo, Tuzla and other “safe areas” designated by the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe application of paragraph 6 of Security Council\r\nresolution 713 (1991) to Bosnia has no basis in legality.\r\nSuch action puts the victim and the aggressor on the same\r\nfooting and thereby deprives a United Nations Member\r\nState of the means of exercising its legitimate right to self-\r\ndefence, a fundamental right enshrined in the Charter. We\r\ntherefore call on the Security Council once again to lift the\r\narms embargo imposed against Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe also pay tribute to Bosnia’s positive response that\r\nshould eliminate the obstacles in the way of lifting that\r\nembargo.\r\nWe fully understand the circumstances under which\r\nBosnia is trying to deal with the situation in a manner that\r\nwould put an end to the suffering of its people who have\r\nfallen victim to very complex regional and international\r\ncross-currents. We call upon the Security Council to heed\r\nthe urgent humanitarian needs and suffering of the Bosnian\r\npeople and to respond by speedily lifting the embargo in\r\norder for Bosnia to defend its sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity. We also call on the international community to\r\nlive up to its commitment under Article 51 of Chapter VIII\r\nof the Charter by enabling Bosnia to defend itself. This is\r\na collective responsibility imposed by the Charter, to which\r\nall peoples of the planet subscribe. The ploys of certain\r\ngroups should not prevent us from standing by what is just\r\nand right.\r\nProceeding from this, our delegation is a sponsor of\r\ndraft resolution A/49/L.14/Rev.1, which we hope will be\r\nadopted unanimously by the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is rightly of\r\nconcern to the international community. It shakes our\r\nfundamental values and sorely tests our declared ability to\r\npromote peace with justice and respect for the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. For over two\r\nyears, one State Member of our Organization has seen its\r\nterritorial integrity and its very existence threatened, while\r\nits people — in particular the Muslim component of that\r\npeople — has been relentlessly exposed to armed\r\naggression, “ethnic cleansing” and every sort of\r\ndeprivation.\r\nThe determination of the international community,\r\nexpressed in professions of faith, statements of intent and\r\neven demands, has rarely been translated into action in\r\nsufficient time, or on an adequate scale, to discourage and\r\ndefeat outbursts of aggression, even though the United\r\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has sought,\r\ncommendably, to carry out its difficult mission, within the\r\nlimits of its resources and its mandate, suffering insults\r\nand injuries which undermine the authority of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe painstaking search for a negotiated political\r\nsolution, which has mobilized the energy of so many\r\npeople of good will, has always encountered intransigence\r\nfrom the leaders of the irredentist Serb minority, which\r\nseeks to impose a dangerous logic of exclusion and\r\nfait accompli. When the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina accepted the peace plan of 6 July 1994, not\r\nwithout sacrifice, it saw its hopes dashed by those\r\ngambling on the international community’s appeasement,\r\nor even the abandonment of its effort, in the face of their\r\nclaims.\r\nThe Permanent Representative of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina made clear to our Assembly this\r\nmorning the harsh reality of the situation in his country.\r\nHe showed beyond all doubt how the maintenance of the\r\nstatus quo is neither possible nor acceptable, at three\r\nlevels: humanitarian, military and political. He also\r\nresoundingly expressed the determination of his people to\r\ndefend their sovereignty and territorial integrity, a\r\ndetermination equalled only by their legitimate\r\nexpectation that the international community will fully\r\nassume its responsibilities. In particular, he defined the\r\ncontext in which lifting the arms embargo is a necessary\r\nfactor in finding a just and lasting solution to the crisis\r\nwhich his country is suffering, whereas extending the\r\napplicability of Security Council resolution 713 (1991) to\r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has the\r\nunjustified effect of stripping that State of its natural right\r\nto self-defence.\r\nWith the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nmarked by a rise in tension and an upsurge in armed\r\nviolence, and with the siege of Sarajevo and other cities\r\nbeing tightened, this debate comes at just the right\r\nmoment to awaken our consciences and alert us all to our\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nAlgeria, motivated entirely by a concern for the\r\nrestoration of peace, security and stability in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the region as a whole, naturally supports\r\nthe resistance of the Bosnian people and its Government, to\r\nwhich my country has always shown its brotherly concern.\r\nIt was just as natural for my delegation to become a\r\nsponsor of the draft resolution, in which the General\r\nAssembly will send a message of hope to the victims and\r\na message of resolve to those doggedly seeking to keep\r\npeace at bay.\r\nMr. Türk (Slovenia): The General Assembly is\r\ndiscussing the tragic situation in the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, while the war in that country is threatening to\r\ncontinue into its third winter. Words spoken at diplomatic\r\nconferences can no longer convincingly address the tragedy,\r\nand humanitarian efforts continue without the hope that\r\npeace can be established soon.\r\nThe international community and its institutions,\r\nincluding the United Nations, have so far been unable to\r\naddress the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina effectively\r\nor to stop the war. One of the reasons for this is the lack of\r\nwill to characterize the conflict as what it actually is. Only\r\na realistic assessment of the situation can give the necessary\r\nbasis for defining adequate remedies. The war in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina is not a religious or ethnic conflict, nor is\r\nit a civil war. The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina began as\r\na war of aggression against a United Nations Member State\r\nand has since remained a war for territorial expansion.\r\nThat this is the nature of the war is clearly manifested\r\nin one of its most heinous characteristics: the practice of\r\n“ethnic cleansing”, which has reached genocidal proportions\r\nagainst the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. “Ethnic\r\ncleansing” was devised as a tool for territorial conquest,\r\naimed at the eventual creation of “greater Serbia”. “Ethnic\r\ncleansing” is not an accidental consequence, but, rather, a\r\npremeditated instrument, of the war. While it is true that\r\nthe war has become increasingly complex and that atrocities\r\nhave been committed by all sides, its original characteristic,\r\nas a war of aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, remains essential.\r\nA comprehensive assessment of the situation in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina should also take into account other lessons\r\nlearned so far. One is that diplomacy without determination\r\nor readiness to use force is fruitless when confronted with\r\nforces of aggression. The international diplomatic action\r\nconcerning Bosnia and Herzegovina has, unfortunately,\r\nlacked this determination. The peace efforts have been not\r\nonly unsuccessful, but, on some occasions, even ridiculed.\r\nThis, after more than two years of unsuccessful\r\nengagement, has contributed to the fact that the image of\r\nthe United Nations remains negatively affected and its\r\ncredibility is eroded.\r\nIt is true that without the involvement of the forces\r\nof the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR),\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) and numerous other humanitarian\r\norganizations the tragedy of Bosnia would have been even\r\nworse. The ongoing efforts to guarantee delivery of\r\nhumanitarian aid deserve our deep appreciation and active\r\nsupport. However, humanitarian assistance cannot be a\r\nsubstitute for effective policies. Further efforts are needed\r\nfor an effective cessation of hostilities and for the creation\r\nof political conditions for peace.\r\nThe United Nations has launched a number of\r\nactivities which could contribute to a comprehensive\r\npeace — if the basic political and other conditions for\r\npeace were created. In this context, we wish to emphasize\r\nthe importance of the work of the Special Rapporteur of\r\nthe Commission on Human Rights, Mr. Tadeusz\r\nMazowiecki, and that of the Commission of Experts\r\nestablished pursuant to Security Council resolution 780\r\n(1992). No substantial progress towards durable peace can\r\nbe achieved without addressing thoroughly the issue of\r\nhuman rights. The perpetrators of gross human rights\r\nviolations must be punished and appropriate measures\r\nhave to be taken to secure the protection of human rights\r\nin the future. For this reason Slovenia welcomed the\r\ncreation of the international war crimes Tribunal and\r\nnotes with appreciation that, according to the report of the\r\nTribunal (A/49/342), the first indictments are expected to\r\nbe ready for presentation before the end of this year.\r\nIt is our view that an efficient and effective\r\ninternational war crimes Tribunal could contribute\r\nsubstantially to the just settlement of the conflict.\r\nHowever, the goal of a final comprehensive political\r\nsolution to the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina will\r\nremain distant as long as the international community\r\nremains unable to devise the effective policies needed to\r\nrestore peace and security as well as the territorial\r\nintegrity and political independence of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nLet me now return to the question of the essential\r\nconditions for a cessation of hostilities and for the\r\nestablishment of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The\r\nWashington Agreements concluded several months ago\r\nand the resulting cooperation between the Bosnian\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nMuslims and Croats restored hope that appropriate\r\ninternational assistance could meaningfully influence the\r\npolitical aspects of the armed conflict. Such political\r\ninfluence is essential in the efforts to change the military\r\nreality on the ground and to open a path towards solutions.\r\nWe therefore have some reason to hope that efforts of the\r\nContact Group will contribute to ending the armed conflict\r\nand to establishing conditions for a political solution with\r\nat least the basic elements of justice. The most essential\r\nelements of a just and durable solution are the preservation\r\nof the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the establishment of a safe environment for\r\nthe voluntary return of refugees, and the restoration of land\r\nand other property seized through “ethnic cleansing” and\r\nthe use of force. It should be stressed again that without a\r\nthorough reversal of the consequences of “ethnic cleansing”\r\nand the use of force it is not likely that peace arrangements\r\nwill endure. Furthermore, failure to achieve such a reversal\r\ncould send a very clear message to other potential\r\naggressors that their acts of aggression might not only go\r\nunpunished but perhaps even be rewarded.\r\nThe question before the General Assembly today\r\nconcerns the immediate steps to be taken with a view to\r\nstrengthening the possibilities for peace. What measures\r\nshould the General Assembly recommend to the Contact\r\nGroup and to the Security Council?\r\nOver the past two years we have witnessed numerous\r\nattempts to bring an end to the armed conflict in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina. The latest proposal introduced by the\r\nContact Group is one of these attempts; it has the potential\r\nto become the point of reference for a peace settlement.\r\nHowever, there is still no sign from the Bosnian Serbs that\r\nthey are ready to submit to the concerted pressure of the\r\nentire international community. This calls for further\r\nmeasures by the United Nations, which should be taken in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nIn that connection, Slovenia supports the draft\r\nresolution before the General Assembly concerning the\r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including its\r\nprovisions regarding the inapplicability of the arms\r\nembargo. It is important to recognize that the embargo was\r\nimposed on the former Yugoslavia back in 1991 when it\r\nstill existed and that the embargo was extended to the\r\nsuccessor States in a specific situation in 1992. Since then,\r\nalmost everything has changed. A decision that would take\r\ninto account the new realities and different situations of\r\neach of the successor States is long overdue.\r\nThere are of course many reasons for keeping the\r\narms embargo as a part of the sanctions imposed under\r\nSecurity Council resolution 757 (1992) until the\r\nconditions for lifting those sanctions are met. On the\r\nother hand, there is a need to recognize the inapplicability\r\nof the arms embargo to those engaged in self-defence,\r\nthat is in the exercise of an inherent right of all United\r\nNations Member States under Article 51 of the Charter.\r\nFinally, in the case of Slovenia, there is no\r\njustification for the continuing applicability of the arms\r\nembargo with respect to my country, which is not\r\ninvolved in any armed conflict that prompted imposition\r\nof that arms embargo years ago against the former\r\nYugoslavia, a State which has since then ceased to exist.\r\nIt is in that context that we view the formulation of\r\nthe eighth preambular paragraph and of operative\r\nparagraph 22 of draft resolution A/49/L.14/Rev.1,\r\nconcerning the inapplicability of the arms embargo\r\nimposed by Security Council resolution 713 (1991), and\r\nit is in that light that we support the relevant paragraphs\r\nof the draft resolution submitted to the General Assembly\r\nfor action today.\r\nThe responsibility of the General Assembly to\r\nrecommend realistic and effective policies on matters\r\nconcerning international peace and security is among the\r\nmost important responsibilities of this United Nations\r\norgan. The draft resolution before us represents an effort\r\nto act in accordance with that responsibility, and we hope\r\nthat it will be adopted by an overwhelming majority.\r\nMrs. Albright (United States of America): The\r\ncurrent situation in the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina engages deeply the interests of my country\r\nand bears directly on the purposes and credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMy Government is pleased to endorse the draft\r\nresolution before the Assembly today. We join in\r\nthanking the courageous personnel of the United Nations\r\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR) and the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR) who are in Bosnia. We, too, demand that all\r\nparties refrain from attacks on them and that all cooperate\r\nin allowing them to perform their vital humanitarian and\r\npeace-keeping missions. We reiterate our condemnation\r\nof the massive violations of international humanitarian\r\nlaw that have occurred, and are occurring, in Bosnia.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nWe reaffirm also our support for the work of the war\r\ncrimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Culpability for\r\nthe outrages committed in that region rests not with the\r\nSerbs or Croats or Muslims as peoples: it rests with the\r\npeople — the individuals — who ordered and committed\r\nthose crimes. The scars of this war will heal much faster if\r\nthe perception of collective guilt for atrocities is erased and\r\nindividual responsibility is assigned.\r\nBut the healing process in Bosnia will not begin in\r\nearnest until the war ends. My Government believes that\r\nstrong new measures are required to settle the war.\r\nAccordingly, we urge members of the Assembly to support,\r\nand make known that support, the Bosnian Government’s\r\nrequest that the Security Council lift the arms embargo\r\nagainst Bosnia now, with implementation in six months if\r\nthe Bosnian Serbs do not agree to a settlement by that time.\r\nIf this conflict is to end, the Bosnian Serbs must\r\nchoose to end it. Although they are not the only party to\r\nthe conflict to which blame may fairly be attached, they are\r\nthe only party prolonging the war. Last July, the Contact\r\nGroup proposed a territorial arrangement that was more\r\nthan fair to the Bosnian Serbs, and made it clear that if one\r\nparty rejected those arrangements and the others accepted,\r\nthat party would face grave consequences. Today, the\r\nBosnian Serbs are the lone holdout against peace. They\r\nalone have said “no” to ending this barbarous war.\r\nUnfortunately, the consequences for them of their rejection\r\nhave not been sufficiently grave.\r\nClearly, the mix of incentives and disincentives now\r\nin place is not sufficient. Economic sanctions have not been\r\ntight enough; enforcement of safe havens and exclusion\r\nzones has not been robust enough; and diplomatic pressures\r\nhave not been united or consistent enough to bring the\r\nBosnian Serbs to a new level of insight.\r\nWe must do more now to make them understand that\r\nsettlement is their best, indeed their only, option. We need\r\nto build on the progress made in persuading the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia to cooperate in isolating the\r\nBosnian Serbs; we should encourage a steady strengthening\r\nof the federation between the Bosnian Government and the\r\nCroats; we should provide for a more rapid and forceful\r\nresponse to violations of safe havens and exclusion zones;\r\nwe must tighten enforcement of sanctions; and we should\r\nlift the arms embargo against Bosnia.\r\nMy Government recognizes that lifting the arms\r\nembargo, even in six months, has risks. But inaction has\r\ngreater risks. The status quo allows the Bosnian Serbs\r\nessentially to dictate the outcome of a conflict that they\r\nbegan and then pursued ruthlessly and in violation of\r\ninternational humanitarian law. Inaction means that United\r\nNations forces in Bosnia will remain vulnerable and\r\nconstrained in their operations. Inaction means that with\r\neach passing day the credibility of the Contact Group’s\r\neffort to settle this war erodes and begins to slip away.\r\nInaction means that the Bosnian people, Serb, Croat and\r\nMuslim, will continue to suffer and to live in fear, and\r\nthat the number of orphans and displaced will continue to\r\ngrow. Inaction pushes further into the future the process\r\nof recovery, reconstruction and reconciliation. And\r\ninaction denies the Bosnian Government, for no cause of\r\nlaw or justice, its inherent right of self-defence.\r\nBosnia has done nothing that would warrant the\r\nimposition of international sanctions. It has not invaded\r\nits neighbours or committed other major transgressions. It\r\nis said that children sometimes inherit the sins of their\r\nparents; in this case, Bosnia simply inherited the sanctions\r\nimposed against its predecessor State.\r\nOne premise for maintaining the arms embargo\r\nagainst Bosnia has always been that lifting it would harm\r\nBosnia’s own interests by precipitating pre-emptive\r\nviolence against Bosnian citizens. That premise had\r\nvalidity only as long as one could argue that keeping the\r\nembargo would lead to an acceptable territorial settlement\r\nand an end to hostilities. Bosnian Serb intransigence has\r\nrobbed that argument of its force.\r\nThe second premise for the embargo has been the\r\nfear that if the embargo is lifted the Bosnian Serbs will\r\nretaliate against United Nations personnel. My\r\nGovernment does not question the basis for that fear, but\r\nwe cannot allow the Bosnian Serbs to hold this world\r\nOrganization hostage; nor can we allow them to blackmail\r\nus into depriving the Bosnian Government of its rights.\r\nBosnia is a sovereign State and a Member of the United\r\nNations. It is independent, it respects international law, it\r\nrespects its own people, and it should not need anyone’s\r\npermission to arm and defend itself.\r\nFifty-eight years ago, the head of a beleaguered,\r\ninvaded, sovereign State appeared before the Assembly of\r\nthis Organization’s predecessor, the League of Nations.\r\nLike President Izetbegović today, Emperor Haile Selassie\r\ndid not ask for international intervention; he asked simply\r\nfor the right to defend his country. He said,\r\n“The Ethiopian Government never expected\r\nother Governments to shed their soldiers’ blood...\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nEthiopian warriors asked only for means to defend\r\nthemselves.” (Records of the Sixteenth Ordinary\r\nSession of the Assembly of the League of Nations,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 18th meeting, p. 24)\r\nEmperor Selassie continued,\r\n“...the issue before the Assembly to-day... is not\r\nmerely a question of [settling one case of] aggression.\r\nIt is a question of collective security;... of the trust\r\nplaced by States in international treaties; of the value\r\nof promises made to small States that their integrity\r\nand their independence shall be respected and assured.\r\nIt is a choice between the principle of the equality of\r\nStates and the imposition upon small Powers of the\r\nbonds of vassalage.” (ibid., p. 25)\r\nTo its shame and ultimate sorrow, the League of\r\nNations did not listen to Haile Selassie, thus allowing the\r\nmomentum towards broader conflict to build. A decade\r\nlater the United Nations was designed to prevent a\r\nrecurrence of that kind of failure of vision and will. It was\r\nestablished to safeguard the rights of every nation. Its\r\nfounders rejected explicitly the doctrine that the strong\r\nshould have the right, by virtue of their strength, to\r\ndominate the weak. The United Nations Charter recognizes\r\nexplicitly the inherent right of individual and collective\r\nself-defence.\r\nYes, there is a need for the United Nations to be\r\nimpartial in Bosnia. But impartiality means fairness, not\r\nfecklessness. There is nothing impartial about treating\r\naggressor and victim the same. There is nothing fair about\r\ndenying to both sides the weaponry that one side already\r\nhas. There has been nothing even-handed about the\r\nconsequences of the arms embargo against Bosnia.\r\nIt is a human tendency spanning all eras and cultures\r\nto believe that because we have said something we have\r\ndone something. The stakes in Bosnia are too great — in\r\nterms of law, principle, precedent and humanity — for us\r\nto indulge that tendency now. It is the essence of leadership\r\nto choose. We can adopt yet another resolution that says all\r\nthe right things but leaves the situation in Bosnia, which is\r\nprofoundly wrong, untouched. Or we can choose a bolder\r\ncourse, conscious of the risks, but determined to surmount\r\nthem.\r\nExperience tells us that if the Bosnian Serbs are ever\r\ngoing to agree to a settlement, it will be in response to a\r\ndemonstration of serious international will. The opportunity\r\nis at hand to demonstrate that will. Let us make good on\r\npast commitments. Let us present the options clearly so\r\nthat the Bosnian Serbs cannot misunderstand. Let us\r\nallow time for a stronger mix of incentives and\r\ndisincentives to have their effect. Let us plan together for\r\na changed diplomatic and military situation in Bosnia. Let\r\nus maintain our own unity, and let us restore to Bosnia\r\nthe rights it deserves.\r\nMr. Nobilo (Croatia): Two years have passed since\r\nthe pictures of emaciated prisoners from the Serb-run\r\nconcentration camp in Omarska shocked the conscience\r\nof the world. The international community has since taken\r\nnumerous measures, mostly of limited scope, hoping that\r\ninternational law and accepted norms of international\r\nbehaviour would offset the overwhelming balance of\r\npower and the systematic designs of evil on the part of\r\nthe Belgrade-controlled Yugoslav Army and its proxies in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.\r\nThis policy of good intentions, despite its obvious\r\nshortcomings, has had some positive elements which\r\ncannot be overlooked. The international community has\r\nappropriated vast resources to lessen the pain and\r\nsuffering of hundreds of thousands of displaced persons\r\nand refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am pleased\r\nto say that my country, despite its own dire\r\ncircumstances, has been at the forefront of this effort.\r\nCroatia’s early and ongoing efforts have saved and\r\ncared for some 800,000 victims of Belgrade’s aggression\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia contributed some\r\n$832 million for the care of Bosnian refugees through\r\n1993 and will continue to do whatever is reasonably\r\npossible in this regard and in other ways.\r\nThe international community has also taken positive\r\nlegal decisions and established institutions to remedy\r\nsome of the horrific consequences of the Serbian\r\naggression in the region. Despite the immediate\r\ndeficiencies of the international community’s policy, some\r\ninternationally binding decisions — such as guarantees\r\ncontained in Security Council resolutions for the territorial\r\nintegrity of violated Member States — and the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the punishment of war crimes\r\ngive us hope that Omarska and many other such\r\ntestimonies to genocide will not be forgotten or erased by\r\nhasty and easy political manoeuvres.\r\nThe debate today and the draft resolution before us\r\nshould serve, not as a forum to lay blame for\r\nopportunities forgone and responsibilities bypassed but,\r\nrather, as a forum to remember and reaffirm our legal\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nresponsibilities towards Member States and our solemn\r\nresponsibility to humanity: to stand up and defend the\r\ninnocent from archaic ideologies, barbarism and\r\nState-sponsored mass murder. The role of the Belgrade\r\nleadership in this cannot and should not be minimized or\r\ntraded away.\r\nTherefore, the judgements of the Committee on the\r\nElimination of Racial Discrimination, recalled in the twelfth\r\npreambular paragraph of draft resolution A/49/L.14/Rev.1,\r\nand of the International Court of Justice, referred to in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth preambular paragraphs, about\r\nthe role and responsibility of the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in respect of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina and Croatia cannot and should not be\r\ntrivialized by short-sighted attempts to outsmart or cajole\r\nthe leadership of that entity.\r\nIn this regard, the Assembly must remain cognizant of\r\nits decisions to reject all attempts by thenew entity called\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and\r\nMontenegro) to enjoy the exclusive successor rights and\r\nprivileges of the former Socialist Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, which has ceased to exist. The Assembly’s\r\nprevious resolutions have clearly established that the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)\r\ncan assume neither sole nor automatic succession of the\r\nformer Member State and that it can join the Assembly\r\nonly when it has implemented all relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions in respect of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\r\nCroatia and has applied for membership. This issue will be\r\na test of the Assembly’s continued dignity.\r\nI have noted three important positive elements of the\r\ninternational community’s policy in respect of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina: humanitarian assistance, legal protection for\r\npre-war borders and the International Tribunal. Another\r\nvery positive element of that policy is outlined in the fifth\r\npreambular paragraph and in operative paragraph 16 of the\r\ndraft resolution. The Washington Agreements have\r\nestablished a solid model for a political solution of the\r\ncrisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina. My Government has\r\ngiven this model its unqualified support, and it welcomes\r\nall efforts intended to promote the timely implementation of\r\nthese Agreements.\r\nIn this regard, one element that is especially\r\nworrisome for my Government is the fact that since the\r\nWashington Agreements were signed some 40,000 Bosnian\r\nCroats have nevertheless departed from some areas under\r\nthe control of the Federation. We are also concerned by\r\nreports about the expulsion of Bosniac Muslims from\r\nMostar.\r\nOperative paragraph 14 of the draft resolution, which\r\ncalls for mutual recognition between the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), also refers to an\r\nimportant mechanism for finding a lasting solution to the\r\nproblems in the region. There are numerous proven\r\ninternational models for the solution of disputes between\r\nStates through mutual recognition — for example, the\r\nprotection of minorities outside national borders. We\r\nwould welcome a strong call from the Assembly for\r\nBelgrade’s recognition of all States successors of the\r\nformer Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia within\r\ntheir internationally recognized borders.\r\nOperative paragraphs 5 and 19 of the draft resolution\r\nattest to the close connection between the situation in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and the situation in the occupied\r\nterritories of Croatia. We have on numerous occasions\r\nbrought to the attention of the international community\r\nthe fact that the Bosnian Serb authorities are cooperating\r\nwith the self-proclaimed Serb authorities from the\r\noccupied territories in Croatia in many ways, especially\r\nmilitarily, not only against Croatia but also against Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina.\r\nThis cooperation, which has proved costly to both\r\nStates, could be curtailed by various means, such as strict\r\nenforcement of paragraph 12 of Security Council\r\nresolution 820 (1993), which prohibits transshipments\r\nthrough the Bosnian Serb-controlled territory without the\r\nprior approval of the Government of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. This is why my Government has\r\ncalled on the border monitoring mission of the\r\nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia to\r\nundertake measures consistent with the resolution.\r\nMy Foreign Minister, in a letter to the\r\nSecretary-General today, notes the risks to stability in the\r\nregion associated with the coordinated activities of the\r\nBosnian Serb paramilitary units and the Serb paramilitary\r\nunits from the occupied territories of Croatia. He advises:\r\n“Croatia reserves the right to act with all\r\nappropriate means against any military involvement\r\nfrom its sovereign territory against the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\"\r\nFurther in regard to the border monitoring mission\r\nof the International Conference on the Former\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nYugoslavia, which has become a critical policy instrument\r\nin the region, my delegation has pointed out that it is\r\npossible that the Serbia-Bosnia blockade regime is being\r\nviolated by air — this idea is based on the no-fly zone\r\nviolation reports from the Secretary-General — and that the\r\nmonitoring mission should account for hundreds of\r\nunauthorized flights in the border areas. The latest report of\r\nthe Secretary-General (S/1994/5/Add.77), which is dated\r\n31 October, indicates that 61 flights of fixed-wing or\r\nrotary-wing aircraft were recorded in a three-day period\r\nbetween 25 and 27 October.\r\nThe situations of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of\r\nCroatia are indeed linked in many ways. In the past,\r\nCroatia has suffered only the negative consequences of this\r\nlinkage. Coming on top of the high expenditures in respect\r\nof Bosnian refugees, Croatia’s problems with regard to\r\noccupied territories were swept under the rug. This is not\r\nworkable, and Croatia must insist on positive consideration\r\nin this regard. The positive linkage must come not only\r\nthrough diplomatic initiatives but also through the use of\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization resources and the\r\neventual lifting of the arms embargo. The necessary balance\r\nin Bosnia cannot be achieved by taking a detour around\r\nCroatia.\r\nOnce again we wish to emphasize the positive\r\nelements of the international community’s policy regarding\r\nBosnia and, similarly, emphasize that these positive\r\nelements should not be minimized or squandered. At times\r\nit becomes worrisome that Bosnia and Herzegovina — a\r\ncountry in the northern hemisphere — finds consistent\r\nsupport in this regard mostly amongst countries of the\r\nsouth. This debate should therefore remind the whole\r\nAssembly of the source of the carnage in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, and the draft resolution before us should serve\r\nto protect the remedies that should and could bring some\r\njustice and hope to this terribly wronged country and its\r\npeople.\r\nMr. Farhadi (Afghanistan) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): One year after the General Assembly’s last debate\r\non this question, we find ourselves discussing the same\r\nproblem. It is a problem of extreme seriousness for the\r\nworld. If one were to compare what is happening this year\r\nto what happened last year, one might say that the situation\r\nhas not improved.\r\nThe aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina goes on, and it continues to threaten\r\ninternational peace and security. It constitutes a very clear\r\nthreat in the region in which Bosnia and Herzegovina is\r\nsituated. Might it not be the beginning of a more\r\nwidespread conflict, a conflict throughout the whole\r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia? The elements — in\r\nparticular, Serbian hegemonistic nationalism — for such\r\na conflagration are there. “Ethnic cleansing” — a crime\r\nagainst mankind — has not ceased.\r\nMr. Biegman (Netherlands), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe situation in Kosovo also continues to deteriorate.\r\nThere is ongoing repression — based on national,\r\nreligious and ethnic extremism on the part of the Serbs —\r\nagainst 2 million people of Albanian descent, and\r\nassurances from the Belgrade regime are deceptive.\r\nOnce again we appeal to the Organization to take up\r\nthe more general issue of the situation of minorities in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, including Sandzak and Vojvodina, by\r\nestablishing an international presence with a view to the\r\npreparation of a report on the matter.\r\nAn important event this year was the establishment\r\nof the Contact Group, whose peace plan the Assembly\r\nshould now support. This is to be found in the Foreign\r\nMinisters’ communiqué. Issued in late July 1994, the\r\ncommuniqué includes Contact Group decisions on\r\nmeasures to be taken in the event of the rejection of the\r\nproposed peace plan.\r\nWe are all well aware that the Government of the\r\nRepublic and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina took\r\nthe decision to accept the peace plan, but that the Bosnian\r\nSerbs, who indeed had not implemented the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, brutally rejected the peace\r\nplan proposed by the Contact Group.\r\nHence, the draft resolution must unambiguously\r\ncondemn the Bosnian Serbs for their refusal to accept the\r\nproposed territorial settlement and must demand that they\r\nimmediately accept this settlement in full and, of course,\r\nunconditionally.\r\nAt this morning’s meeting, the representative of\r\nUkraine stated that it was necessary and appropriate to\r\nimpose restrictions on the role of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation is certain that the General Assembly has\r\nevery right to encourage, indeed strongly request, the\r\nSecurity Council to give serious consideration to lifting\r\nthe embargo on deliveries of weapons and military\r\nequipment to the Republic and Federation of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina that was imposed by the Security Council\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nthree years ago in resolution 713 (1991), of 25 September\r\n1991. That is further outlined in the eighth preambular\r\nparagraph of the draft resolution which we have joined in\r\nsponsoring.\r\nThere is also the principle of individual responsibility\r\nfor crimes against humanity and other serious violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law, in this case perpetrated in\r\nthe territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The International\r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since\r\n1991 has now begun its work and we trust that justice will\r\nbe done.\r\nTurning again to the question of the embargo, I would\r\nrecall that in this very Hall last year, and on several\r\noccasions in the Security Council, my delegation has stated\r\nits view quite clearly that if the embargo imposed on\r\nYugoslavia were applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina it\r\nwould be completely illegal. Indeed, this is a point of law\r\nthat has been made several times by international bodies.\r\nThe representative of the United States, whose\r\neloquence we very much appreciated, rightly recalled that\r\nBosnia has inherited an unjustified punishment from the\r\npredecessor State, Yugoslavia, and she used some words\r\nthat I think, and hope, will go down in history in regard to\r\nthis case:\r\n“There is nothing impartial about treating aggressor\r\nand victim the same”. (supra, p. 7)\r\nWhen the representative of Germany addressed the\r\nAssembly on behalf of the European Union, he made some\r\nvery important points, for which we are grateful. But we do\r\nnot agree with him that a political settlement should be\r\nsought until all means have been exhausted and that the\r\nembargo should be lifted only as a last resort. We feel that\r\nthe time has come to apply this last resort.\r\nEnough blood has been shed. To continue to tie the\r\nhands of the victims would mean encouraging and\r\nemboldening the aggressor, who is already armed to the\r\nteeth, having inherited the terrifying arsenal of the former\r\nYugoslavia’s army.\r\nWe wish to pay tribute to President Alija Izetbegović\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, who made a very wise and fair\r\nproposal for a de jure lifting of the illegal embargo against\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, to be followed in six months by\r\nthe actual lifting of the embargo if the Bosnian Serbs\r\ncontinued to reject the peace plan of the Contact Group.\r\nWell, the Bosnian Serbs are still rejecting that peace plan.\r\nWe thank Ambassador Batu of Turkey for rightly\r\nreminding us this morning that the five members of the\r\nContact Group had indeed been in agreement that the\r\nSecurity Council could study the question of lifting the\r\nembargo if the Bosnian Serb side continued to reject the\r\nContact Group’s peace plan.\r\nMr. Osvald (Sweden): I am pleased to make this\r\nstatement on behalf of the five Nordic countries —\r\nDenmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.\r\nThe Nordic countries share the views expressed in\r\nthe statement made by the German presidency on behalf\r\nof the European Union.\r\nThe Nordic countries start from the premise of the\r\nindisputable territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina and the legitimacy of its Government.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina must be allowed to function once\r\nagain as the multi-cultural society it was only a few years\r\nago. We need a process of healing, reconciliation and\r\nreintegration across religious and ethnic lines.\r\nThe Nordic countries support the process of\r\nnegotiations with a view to finding a comprehensive\r\npolitical settlement of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nWe are encouraged by the renewed contacts on a high\r\npolitical level between Belgrade and Zagreb. The\r\nrelentless efforts and the concrete proposals worked out\r\nby the international community, including the Contact\r\nGroup and the International Conference on the Former\r\nYugoslavia, have our strong support. The search for a\r\nsolution is currently in a dynamic phase.\r\nWe are very concerned at renewed escalation of\r\nfighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The situation around\r\nSarajevo is deteriorating. Once again the civilians are\r\nvictimized in the capital and other enclaves. The Nordic\r\ncountries strongly appeal to the parties to immediately\r\ncease all hostilities, and urge the Bosnian Serbs to\r\nunconditionally accept the Contact Group plan.\r\nThe sanctions regime is an important element in the\r\nsearch for a solution. The Nordic countries support the\r\nSecurity Council’s recent decision to tighten the sanctions\r\nagainst the Bosnian-Serb side for its refusal to accept a\r\nterritorial settlement for Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the\r\nsame time, the Security Council decided to suspend some\r\nof the sanctions against the Federal Republic of\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nYugoslavia. Further easing of sanctions will be contingent\r\non additional significant and well-defined steps taken by\r\nBelgrade.\r\nThe timely and constructive efforts of the International\r\nConference on the Former Yugoslavia to establish a\r\nmission on the border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia contribute to the\r\nisolation of the Bosnian Serbs. The Nordic countries, being\r\nso far the main contributors to the mission, urge other\r\ncountries to join in supporting it financially and with\r\npersonnel.\r\nThe Nordic countries are among the largest\r\ncontributors to the peace process, participating in\r\nhumanitarian operations — where the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) plays\r\nthe leading role — and the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR), as well as in other efforts.\r\nThe presence of UNPROFOR will continue to be vital\r\nfor the maintenance of supply routes of humanitarian aid\r\ninto Bosnia and Herzegovina, for the safe areas and as an\r\noverall element of stability in a volatile situation. The\r\nagreed close coordination of UNPROFOR and the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an important\r\nelement in this regard. Despite limitations in manpower and\r\nother resources, constant infringements on its freedom of\r\nmovement and allegations of ineffectiveness, UNPROFOR\r\nis doing a first-rate job.\r\nUNPROFOR must act decisively, and not fall victim\r\nto intimidation, in order to maintain respect for its mandate\r\nand its troops.\r\nWe welcome the procedure laid down in the meetings\r\nof UNPROFOR between representatives of the members of\r\nthe Security Council, the Secretary-General and the\r\ntroop-contributing countries, and call for the further\r\ndevelopment and formalization of this mechanism for other\r\nUnited Nations operations.\r\nA lifting of the arms embargo would have serious\r\nimplications for the security of UNPROFOR and the\r\nhumanitarian aid operations it has been mandated to protect.\r\nThis would in turn further victimize the beneficiaries of this\r\nvital humanitarian aid — namely, the civilian population,\r\nincluding the Muslims. Moreover, the risk of an escalated\r\nwar and a proliferation of the conflict would increase.\r\nIn the absence of a negotiated settlement, the human\r\ntragedy will continue. The Nordic countries deplore the\r\ncontinued “ethnic cleansing” taking place, particularly in\r\nareas under Bosnian Serb control. This practice must\r\ncease. We must support the work of the International\r\nTribunal with regard to the former Yugoslavia to bring\r\nthe perpetrators of breaches of international humanitarian\r\nlaw to justice, and establish a deterrent for those who\r\nmight be contemplating renewed acts of “ethnic\r\ncleansing” and other abhorrent practices. In the meantime,\r\nwe must keep up our humanitarian efforts.\r\nOnce a peace settlement has been achieved the\r\npeoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to start the\r\nlong and cumbersome path of a return to normal life. In\r\nthis process the international community will have to\r\nassume its share of responsibility for rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction and the repatriation of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons, the success of which is a crucial\r\nprecondition for a durable peace. Rehabilitation plans\r\nmust be conceived in a regional context and must aim at\r\nfostering reconciliation, respect for human rights and\r\ndemocratic principles.\r\nEfforts to achieve reconstruction have started in\r\ncertain areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, notably in\r\nSarajevo and Mostar, led by the United Nations and the\r\nEuropean Union respectively. These efforts are of the\r\nutmost importance as a way to contribute to the peace\r\nprocess at large. Every little step towards the\r\nnormalization of everyday life is also a step towards\r\npeace.\r\nMr. Al-Ni’mah (Qatar) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nHere we are once again doing what we have done time\r\nand again over the past years; discussing the tragic\r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We find ourselves,\r\nas we did in the past, with our world looking on while the\r\ntragedy unfolds. Once again we find this Assembly\r\nhaunted, as in past years, by the ghosts of those martyrs,\r\ntheir wounds dripping blood and their mouths and tongues\r\nuttering words of anguish that should set the conscience\r\nalight, calling for help, bemoaning the many Muslim\r\nvictims butchered by those unjust extremist people, the\r\nSerbs, asking for international succour that is not\r\nforthcoming, that is hoped for but turns out to be a\r\ndeceptive mirage, that is aspired after but, when reveals\r\nitself, it turns out to be a toothless champion, a rainless\r\ncloud and a gourd that contains nothing but injustice and\r\nharm.\r\nWhat are we to do with promises that are made to\r\ntaste like honey, with beautiful words that come at us\r\nfrom the halls of the Security Council and that ramble in\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nthe statements read before this Assembly? It behoves us to\r\ncall on those that are hesitant to stop being hesitant and to\r\nspare no effort in trying to save those whose blood is being\r\nshed. Do not those who are hesitant know that the Serb\r\nextremists have perpetrated many unspeakable acts and\r\ncommitted many atrocious crimes and do not they realize\r\nthat this forum should take the necessary action, provide the\r\nnecessary treatment and become the physician and healer\r\nwhen there is no other remedy?\r\nWhen one bears responsibility before history for taking\r\nhumanitarian action, one should not ignore the fact that the\r\nwounds of Bosnia and Herzegovina still bleed, and that\r\nbloodshed is on the increase. The Bosnian victims are\r\nreminding all those who would not strive for peace that the\r\ncitizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina have no option but to\r\nfight for their lives and their livelihood. The only\r\nalternative is the grave, since life is not worth the\r\nhumiliation.\r\nWhat kind of life is this for those who are deprived of\r\ndignity and respect in their own homeland? The people of\r\nBosnia have been ignored by the United Nations. That is\r\nwhy they have been suffering all this. History and the\r\nwhole world have denied them their rights, and they have\r\nsuffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.\r\nIt is the Bosnian people who are living on the absolute\r\nminimum needed for survival, and the price they pay is\r\ntheir own blood and suffering. The Assembly must be\r\naware of all this, and if it is not, we must provide the\r\ninformation: the victims in Bosnia and Herzegovina have\r\nbeen victimized by mass killings and by the injustice of the\r\nSerbs. They are at a dead end, and there is no light at the\r\nend of the tunnel. They wonder, as we do at this late stage,\r\nif this is not the time for this international forum to feel the\r\nspirit of humanity and conscientiousness, and if this is not\r\nthe time for the international community to consider rising\r\nup to its responsibilities instead of just extending\r\ncondolences to the victims of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWords and statements mean nothing. The martyrs are\r\nbleeding and praying to Allah to have mercy on them. They\r\nappeal to this forum to be a place where the word of truth\r\nis uttered, to resurrect its dead conscience, to defend them\r\nfrom cruelty and to let its conscience be newly inspired by\r\nthe martyrs and the victims of Serb criminal acts.\r\nOtherwise, no matter how long we live, this forum will\r\ncontinue to witness the hatred in that part of the world and\r\nto watch Serb hatred manifested in ethnic cleansing.\r\nBloodshed will demand new blood, and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina will become an endless fire that spares no one.\r\nWith regard to the question of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the State of Qatar believes that there are\r\nself-evident facts and principles that should not be\r\nignored or abandoned. These are facts that are contained\r\nin all the resolutions of the Assembly and of the Security\r\nCouncil, and in the statements made in international\r\nforums, foremost among which are the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference, the Non-Aligned Movement and\r\nthe League of Arab States. The facts we refer to are the\r\nfollowing:\r\nFirst: the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nis a sovereign, independent State Member of the\r\nUnited Nations that enjoys all the rights provided for\r\nin the Charter, including the right to self-defence in\r\nkeeping with Article 51.\r\nSecond: the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina should be enabled to preserve its\r\nindependence, its unity and territorial integrity, and\r\nit is necessary to underscore the responsibility of the\r\nSecurity Council in this respect under Article 24 of\r\nthe Charter.\r\nThird: as the odious policy of ethnic cleansing,\r\nand its results, are unacceptable to the international\r\ncommunity, and as the acquisition of other people’s\r\nterritories by means of ethnic cleansing and by force\r\nis illegal under international law, those who have\r\nacquired such territories should be made to give up\r\nthose lands.\r\nFourth, perpetrators of acts of genocide and of\r\ncrimes against humanity should be brought to trial\r\nand punished. This calls for the exercise by the\r\nInternational Tribunal of its mandate without delay,\r\nand it should be enabled to do so.\r\nFifth, the right of all refugees and displaced\r\npersons to return voluntarily to their homeland in\r\npeace and dignity must be upheld.\r\nSixth, the city of Sarajevo should be preserved\r\nas it is an ancient and historic city with a special\r\ncultural character, and the hometown of a multi-\r\nethnic and multi-religious community.\r\nSeventh, all proposals to settle the conflict\r\nshould be in keeping with the United Nations\r\nCharter and the principles of international law. They\r\nshould be just and equitable in order for the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nsettlement to guarantee the establishment of durable\r\npeace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe tragedy of Bosnia, whose chapters we have\r\nwitnessed from the very beginning, and the attendant\r\ntragedies and suffering that daily befall this Muslim people,\r\nwho are thus subjected to atrocities, killing and\r\ndisplacement, bespeaks the inability of the international\r\ncommunity as represented in this General Assembly to\r\ndeter the aggressor, or to put an end to aggression.\r\nThis aggression is directed at the Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, a Member State of the United Nations. In\r\nthat State the aggressors, the Serb extremists, have practised\r\nthe odious policy of ethnic cleansing and all sorts of\r\nbarbaric acts including mass killings and murder, rape,\r\ndisplacement of populations and serious violations of\r\nhuman rights. All appeals to these aggressors have fallen on\r\ndeaf ears. This makes it imperative for the United Nations\r\nto shoulder the responsibility it has so far failed to\r\ndischarge as the major Powers have failed to rise to their\r\nresponsibilities by imposing an adequate solution that would\r\nput an end to this tragic situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nThis has added a new and sad chapter to the history of\r\nmankind, a chapter recounting the United Nations inability\r\nto act, the collapse of all the moral standards, enshrined in\r\nits Charter to which we should all be committed, the\r\ncollapse of the mainstays of peace and security in today’s\r\nworld. My delegation therefore calls upon every member of\r\nthe international community to take a firm decision and\r\nimpose decisive steps and measures that would eliminate\r\nthe effects of the aggression against Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, restore what has been usurped, return what\r\nhas been plundered and thereby return to the people of that\r\nland their rights. By so doing, the international community\r\nwould reinstate a spirit of commitment to the United\r\nNations Charter, a spirit of adherence to international law\r\nand the authority of the law, deter those who would violate\r\nit and lay the foundations of cooperation and understanding\r\namongst peoples in a world in which, we hope, justice and\r\npeace may prevail and foster tolerance, benevolence and a\r\nspirit of mutual trust; a world in which benefits are mutual\r\nand common interests are respected. Steps must be taken to\r\nmake the planet a happy place, a place where human well-\r\nbeing can be achieved and in which all people enjoy\r\nprosperity.\r\nThe people and Government of the State of Qatar at\r\nevery level have clearly demonstrated their position in\r\nsupport of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have\r\nsought with all our power to extend a supporting hand to\r\nthat people and to help them face the tragedies and\r\nafflictions that beset them. We have contributed to\r\nmeasures designed to enable that people to regain their\r\nrights, preserve their national identity and independence\r\nand achieve their legitimate ambitions, which are\r\nguaranteed and protected by the United Nations Charter.\r\nProceeding from this, the delegation of Qatar is a\r\nsponsor of draft resolution A/49/L.14/Rev.1 now before\r\nus, which embodies all the principles I have just\r\nenunciated and which sets forth the minimum that must\r\nbe accomplished by the international community if there\r\nis to be a just and lasting peace settlement in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina that would guarantee the rights of the\r\nBosnian Moslems within the borders of an independent\r\nState.\r\nMr. Chung-Ha Yoo (Republic of Korea): One year\r\nago in this very forum we were deploring the tragedy of\r\nthe conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nToday, despite numerous appeals and efforts by the\r\ninternational community, the scene remains largely\r\nunchanged. The bitter hostilities in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina continue to pose a serious threat to\r\ninternational peace and security, and acts of genocide and\r\n“ethnic cleansing” have not ceased. Even as we speak, the\r\npeople of Bosnia continue to suffer from senseless\r\nbrutality.\r\nWhile appreciating the efforts undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations and its Member States — including the\r\nUnited States, the Russian Federation and the countries of\r\nthe European Union — to bring about a negotiated\r\nsettlement, the Republic of Korea believes that the\r\ninternational community as a whole needs to take further\r\nsteps to end the atrocities being committed in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nThe year 1994 began with relatively hopeful signs\r\nfor peace in Bosnia. In March, the Washington\r\nAgreements laid down a foundation for a just and viable\r\npeace in Bosnia and Herzegovina by defining the\r\nframework of a federation which would preserve the\r\nterritorial integrity and unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nas a multicultural, multireligious and multi-ethnic State.\r\nHowever, the momentum for a comprehensive peace soon\r\ndissipated, when the Bosnian Serb forces refused to join\r\nthe federation. In July the Bosnian Serb forces rejected\r\nyet another plan presented by the Contact Group.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nIn this regard, the decision of the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia last August to break off its political and\r\neconomic ties with the Bosnian Serbs and close its borders\r\nwith the Serb-held areas was noteworthy. The Republic of\r\nKorea hopes that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will\r\nsincerely adhere to its commitment.\r\nHowever, monitoring the compliance of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia with its commitment is a substantial\r\ntask which the United Nations cannot neglect. We hope that\r\nthe Security Council will devise an effective mechanism to\r\nverify such compliance.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has been following with grave\r\nconcern the massive and systematic violation of human\r\nrights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in those areas\r\nunder the control of the Bosnian Serb forces. In the cities\r\nof Bosnia where Serbs, Croats and Muslims once lived side\r\nby side, “ethnic cleansing”, genocide, abuse of women,\r\ntorture and arbitrary executions have now become a\r\ncommon practice. The Republic of Korea strongly demands\r\nthat all forms of inhuman acts of “ethnic cleansing”,\r\nwherever they occur and by whomever they are committed,\r\ncease immediately. If “ethnic cleansing” and the\r\nstrangulation of Sarajevo and other “safe areas” continue,\r\nthe international community should take concrete steps as\r\nproposed by the Contact Group, including the strengthening\r\nof sanctions against the offending party.\r\nGiven the importance to international peace and\r\nsecurity of the protection of fundamental human rights, the\r\nestablishment of the International Tribunal to prosecute\r\nthose who have violated international humanitarian law in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia was an important initial step. My\r\nGovernment pledges its full support for the work of the\r\nTribunal.\r\nA lasting peace can be achieved only through political\r\nmeans, not military force. All parties to the conflict must\r\nunderstand that use of arms cannot open the door to peace.\r\nAt the same time, my delegation fully understands and\r\nshares the apprehensions of troop-contributing countries that\r\nlifting the arms embargo will aggravate the situation and\r\nalso seriously affect the safety of peace-keepers deployed\r\nin the area. However, having thus far failed to secure peace\r\nin the region, the international community has a moral and\r\npolitical obligation to respond to the Bosnian people’s\r\nlegitimate concern about their very existence.\r\nIn this regard my delegation notes that President Alija\r\nIzetbegović of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nannounced on 27 September that he would limit the demand\r\nfor lifting the arms embargo to the adoption of a formal\r\nresolution and accept a deferment of the actual\r\nimplementation of the resolution for up to six months.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Korea wishes to\r\ncommend his announcement as an appropriate and\r\njudicious step. We earnestly hope that the situation in\r\nBosnia will improve so that the Bosnian people will not\r\nhave to face the same difficult question when the\r\nsix-month period has expired.\r\nHistory teaches us that political advantage wrested\r\nby crude military force cannot be sustained. The Bosnian\r\nSerb leadership must realize that it can join the\r\ninternational community only by accepting a negotiated\r\nsettlement. The Republic of Korea urges it to accept the\r\nContact Group peace plan unconditionally and in full and\r\nto respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political\r\nindependence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian\r\nSerb forces should also allow the United Nations\r\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR) complete freedom of\r\nmovement and access to problem areas.\r\nIt is crucial that the international community actively\r\nengage in alleviating the suffering of the Bosnian people\r\nand facilitating a negotiated settlement based on the\r\nprinciple of cooperation and genuine partnership. As a\r\nMember State that is firmly committed to maintaining\r\ninternational peace and protecting the welfare of the\r\nglobal citizenry, the Republic of Korea will continue to\r\nparticipate in international efforts to restore peace and\r\njustice to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nMy delegation believes that the draft resolution\r\nbefore us generally reflects the position of my\r\nGovernment, and we will vote in favour of it. We hope\r\nthat today’s resolution will be another significant step in\r\nour efforts for peace in Bosnia.\r\nIn closing, the delegation of the Republic of Korea\r\nwould like to express its deep appreciation and pay tribute\r\nto the personnel of UNPROFOR, the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and\r\nother humanitarian organizations. In light of the\r\ndangerous situations in which they carry out their duties,\r\nmy delegation would like to emphasize the primary\r\nimportance of ensuring the safety of the brave men and\r\nwomen who are risking their lives to bring peace and\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the people of Bosnia on behalf\r\nof the international community.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria): War, aggression, human\r\nsuffering and grave violations of human rights continue to\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nrage in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the same time,\r\ninternational efforts aimed at putting an end to the ongoing\r\nfighting and the resulting human tragedies have entered a\r\ncritical phase.\r\nNumerous earlier attempts to bring about an effective\r\ncease-fire and to alleviate the intolerable humanitarian\r\nsituation have again and again raised high hopes among the\r\nsuffering people in Bosnia and Herzegovina; all of them\r\nhave fallen short of meeting these expectations. Hopes are\r\nonce again pinned upon the most recent proposal: the plan\r\nfor a territorial settlement worked out and presented to the\r\nparties by the Contact Group.\r\nIn order to be viable, any solution will have to be\r\nachieved in accordance with all relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, with the principles adopted by the London\r\nConference on the Former Yugoslavia in August 1992 and\r\nwith the norms established within the framework of the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\r\nOn this basis, the Contact Group plan offers a sound\r\nfoundation for a cessation of hostilities as the essential\r\nprerequisite for further efforts towards a lasting political\r\nsolution to the conflict. This process, long and strenuous as\r\nit might be, should and must finally lead to peace, mutual\r\nrespect and mutual understanding in a multi-ethnic\r\ncommunity. The logic of peace must finally overcome the\r\nlogic of war.\r\nWe therefore join the previous speakers, especially the\r\nrepresentative of Germany speaking on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, in welcoming the acceptance of the\r\nproposed territorial settlement plan in full by the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe also join in condemning the continued rejection of the\r\nplan by the Pale leadership of the Bosnian Serbs. This\r\nrejection stands in clear opposition to the expectations of\r\nthe international community as expressed in Security\r\nCouncil resolution 942 (1994), which clearly demands that\r\nthe Bosnian Serb party accept this settlement. Once again,\r\nthe credibility of the Security Council and hence of the\r\nglobal system of collective security is at stake.\r\nAll international efforts must therefore now be united\r\nto exercise the strongest possible pressure on the Bosnian\r\nSerb leadership. Through the maintenance of political and\r\neconomic isolation two unequivocal messages must be\r\ndelivered to that leadership: first, a message of our absolute\r\ncondemnation of its continued policy of aggression and\r\nobstruction, its rejection of the settlement plan and its lack\r\nof cooperation even in the field of humanitarian assistance;\r\nand, secondly, a message of our absolute condemnation of\r\nits continued policy of “ethnic cleansing”, its systematic\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law and its\r\nsystematic campaign of terror. For all these acts, those\r\nresponsible must be held personally accountable. We\r\ntherefore urge the speedy initiation of the judiciary\r\nprocess by the International Tribunal set up for the\r\npunishment of all war crimes in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nwithout any infringement of a political nature.\r\nIn view of the existing limitations upon international\r\naction in the former Yugoslavia, sanctions and their\r\nproper application in order to provide incentives and\r\ndisincentives have gained the highest importance as a\r\nmeans of pressure for gaining cooperation. The\r\ninternational community has proved its willingness to act\r\naccordingly, on the one hand in tightening the sanctions\r\nregime against the Bosnian Serbs and their leadership to\r\nachieve compliance with the settlement plan, and on the\r\nother in honouring the decision of the authorities in\r\nBelgrade, whose main responsibility for the tragic events\r\nin former Yugoslavia has been generally recognized, to\r\nclose the border between the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and Bosnia. We\r\nsupport the establishment of the mission of the\r\nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. We\r\nsincerely hope that Belgrade, after this first step in the\r\nright direction, will follow this path without further\r\nhesitation and contribute constructively to the process of\r\nfinding a peaceful solution.\r\nTo maintain this momentum, Austria supports\r\nrelevant proposals that are being advanced on the best\r\npossible utilization of the incentives-disincentives\r\nmechanism. In this context, the recognition by the former\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and of Croatia within their present borders\r\nmust be considered as the minimum condition for any\r\nfurther move on the question of sanctions. Furthermore,\r\nthe continuous violations of human rights in Kosovo,\r\nSandjak and Vojvodina will have to be taken into\r\naccount.\r\nIn view of the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina is\r\nstill denied adequate protection within the framework of\r\nthe system of collective security, we must regard as\r\nlegitimate the demands of the Government of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina for the lifting of the arms embargo enacted\r\nby Security Council resolution 713 (1991). The exercise\r\nby the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of its right of\r\nself-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of this\r\nOrganization must not be impeded. At the same time, we\r\nare aware of the dilemma that might be created by the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nlifting of the embargo, as well as of the difficulties inherent\r\nin such a decision, which could entail far-reaching\r\nconsequences. In our view, therefore, all factors must be\r\ncarefully considered, including the necessary flexibility\r\nconcerning the timing of the decision and the actual lifting\r\nof the arms embargo. We understand that operative\r\nparagraph 22 of the draft resolution before us, in\r\nconjunction with the eighth preambular paragraph, provides\r\nroom for such careful consideration and flexibility. In this\r\ncontext we have taken note of the statement made this\r\nmorning by the Permanent Representative of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, in which he referred to the need to coordinate\r\nall efforts, including those of the Contact Group, the\r\nSecurity Council and the UNPROFOR troop contributors,\r\nin the search for peace and in order to minimize any\r\npotential negative effect on their endeavours.\r\nWe therefore hope and trust that further action on this\r\nissue will be based on a thorough examination and analysis\r\nof all relevant aspects. We would have preferred clearer\r\nlanguage to this effect in the draft resolution before us.\r\nFinally, we wish to pay sincere tribute to all those at\r\nthe negotiation table and to those on the ground who,\r\ndespite many setbacks, have not ceased their efforts and\r\nhave not given up their belief in the possibility of a lasting\r\npolitical settlement. In particular, we express our deepest\r\nappreciation for the tireless endeavours, exerted under the\r\nmost difficult and dangerous conditions, of the personnel of\r\nthe United Nations Protection Force, the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and all other\r\nhumanitarian organizations.\r\nMr. Rabbani (Pakistan): During the past 32 months,\r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been engulfed\r\nin a long twilight struggle against repression and terror in\r\nwhat history will record as the gravest tragedy, while the\r\nworld looked on as bystanders, as if paralysed. The\r\nGovernment and the people of this State have been\r\nsubjected to the most blatant aggression and genocide\r\nwitnessed in modern history. The people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina are not only the victims of aggression but are\r\nalso subjected to double standards and to cynical\r\nabandonment. The international community has, by and\r\nlarge, remained helpless and unwilling to defend a Member\r\nof the United Nations faced with extinction through\r\naggression and genocide.\r\nWe are discussing the situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina at a critical moment. The Government of\r\nBosnia has displayed a sense of responsibility by accepting\r\nthe peace proposal of the five-nation Contact Group,\r\nwhich has recently been endorsed by the Security\r\nCouncil. This peace proposal does not respond fully to the\r\nrequirements of justice and equity. It will not fully\r\nreverse the consequences of Serbian aggression in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, nor will it fully remove the\r\nconsequences of “ethnic cleansing”.\r\nOn the other hand, the Bosnian Serb party continues\r\nto defiantly reject the peace plan, and its wanton\r\naggression against the civilian population in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina continues unabated. As a result of this\r\naggression, 70 per cent of the territory of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina remains under Serbian\r\noccupation, 200,000 civilians have been killed, and over\r\n1 million inhabitants of Bosnia have been expelled from\r\ntheir homes. As if this were not enough, hundreds of\r\ncities and villages have been destroyed - burned and razed\r\nto the ground. The magnitude of the tragedy in Bosnia is\r\nan ugly scar on the conscience of the civilized world as\r\nto its ability to act in order to preserve the ideals that it\r\ncherishes.\r\nIn total defiance of the will of the international\r\ncommunity as articulated in the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference (OIC), the Bosnian Serb party\r\ncontinues its campaign of “ethnic cleansing”, genocide\r\nand terror against the non-Serbian population, particularly\r\nthe Muslims, while consolidating its hold on territories\r\nseized through the use of force. Bosnian Serb forces\r\ncontinue to violate “safe areas”, the exclusion zones and\r\nthe no-fly zone in Bosnia and Herzegovina with impunity.\r\nThe international community, in particular the\r\nSecurity Council and the States members of the European\r\nContact Group, have failed to effectively respond to this\r\nsituation by undertaking strong enforcement measures,\r\nparticularly the use of force and air strikes, already\r\nauthorized by the relevant Security Council resolutions. In\r\nthe recent past, the Bosnian Serbs blatantly violated the\r\nno-fly zone by conducting hundreds of helicopter flights\r\nbetween the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the\r\nSerb-held areas in Bosnia and ferried large quantities of\r\narms and ammunition from the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nWhile the Serbs have demonstrated utter contempt\r\nfor the mandatory Chapter VII resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil, the international community has stood by\r\nsilently. It has, in fact, allowed Serbia and Montenegro to\r\nact in any manner it wants. Ironically, on 23 September\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\n1994, the Security Council adopted resolution 943 (1994),\r\nwhich partially eased sanctions on the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia in return for its willingness to place a limited\r\nnumber of international monitors along its borders with the\r\nSerb-held areas of Bosnia. This move by the Security\r\nCouncil is nothing less than appeasing and rewarding the\r\naggressor and sacrificing the principles of justice and equity\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. This has sent\r\nentirely the wrong message to Belgrade. It is likely to\r\nharden the Serbian position with regard not only to the\r\noverall settlement of the Bosnian conflict but also to the\r\nproblems of the Balkan region in general. Effective\r\nmonitoring of the borders between Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand Serbia and Montenegro to prevent arms supplies\r\nflowing to the Bosnian Serbs is likely to prove difficult.\r\nPakistan voted against that resolution.\r\nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference has all\r\nalong been seized with the tragic situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and has made a significant contribution to\r\nupholding the legitimate rights of the Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina and its people. The solidarity and support\r\nextended by the entire Islamic World to the brave Bosnian\r\npeople has helped them to resist the Serbian aggressors.\r\nOur endeavours have mobilized the world community to\r\nwake from its slumber and face the realities of the brutality\r\nand slaughter imposed on the Bosnian people. Pakistan is\r\nproud to be Chairman of the twenty-first Islamic\r\nConference of Foreign Ministers, and in that capacity to\r\nchair the OIC Contact Group on Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nDuring the Seventh Extraordinary Session of the\r\nForeign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic\r\nConference, held in Islamabad from 7 to 9 September 1994,\r\na declaration and a comprehensive resolution were adopted\r\nthat strongly urge all concerned to take a series of measures\r\nto strengthen the peace process and to reverse the\r\nconsequences of aggression against Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. An extraordinary meeting of the OIC Contact\r\nGroup at the Ministerial level took place in New York on\r\n29 September 1994 and renewed its full and unqualified\r\nsupport for our Bosnian brothers and sisters.\r\nPakistan is of the view that the continuing inhuman\r\natrocities committed by Serbia on the non-Serb population\r\nof Bosnia and the inexplicable inability of the international\r\ncommunity to effectively respond to it make it ever more\r\nimperative that the Security Council end the de facto arms\r\nembargo on Bosnia and permit the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to exercise their basic right of self-defence\r\nunder Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. In this\r\ncontext, we welcome the recent initiative of the United\r\nStates in the Security Council. We extend our full support\r\nto the early adoption of a resolution that seeks to lift the\r\narms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nAt the same time, the Security Council should take\r\nappropriate measures to relieve the prevailing\r\nhumanitarian catastrophe in Sarajevo. It should\r\nmeaningfully and forcefully respond to any further\r\nviolations of its resolutions, including resolutions\r\n824 (1993), 836 (1993) and 900 (1994). Further measures\r\nshould be adopted by the Security Council to declare the\r\nentire 51 per cent territory allocated to the Muslim-Croat\r\nFederation as a “safe area”.\r\nPakistan urges the International Tribunal to take\r\nimmediate measures for the prosecution and punishment\r\nof war criminals. In this regard, we urge the international\r\ncommunity to come forward with material and financial\r\nassistance to ensure the effective functioning of the\r\nTribunal, especially relating to the recording of evidence\r\nof female witnesses. The Tribunal must also establish a\r\nliaison office in Sarajevo in order to coordinate its work\r\nwith the authorities of Bosnia.\r\nI take this opportunity to reiterate that the\r\nGovernment and the people of Pakistan deeply appreciate\r\nand fully support the principled, courageous and\r\nconciliatory position taken by the Bosnian Government,\r\nespecially in accepting the five-nation European Contact\r\nGroup’s peace plan, which imposes a difficult burden of\r\ninternal border delimitations. Pakistan fully backs the\r\ndemand made by the President of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly in his address in a plenary of the General\r\nAssembly last month.\r\nIn conclusion, from the rostrum of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations, let the word go forth\r\nthat no sacrifice will be too great, no difficulty\r\ninsurmountable for the Bosnian people to achieve final\r\nvictory in their struggle. While a civilized or so-called\r\ncivilized world looks helpless in its inactivity, Pakistan\r\nexpresses its solidarity with the just, righteous and\r\nprincipled struggle of the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and recognizes the courage, steadfastness\r\nand commitment to principles of the people and\r\nleadership of this State. It is of the firm belief that, as\r\nhistory comes full circle, there will be light at the end of\r\nthe tunnel.\r\nMr. Abu Odeh (Jordan) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): Once again, the General Assembly discusses the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Once again, the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the body that represents the international\r\nwill, tries to muster the necessary will to adopt a new\r\nresolution in the hope that the adoption of such a resolution\r\nwill put an end to the tragedy of that Republic, which, since\r\nits emergence, has been the target of a systematic Serbian\r\naggression, whose tragic consequences and horrific\r\nmanifestations, which are well-known to the international\r\ncommunity, testify to the Organization’s inability to end\r\ninjustice and to uphold what is right.\r\nWhen we speak of the tragedy of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, we speak of a tragedy that has two facets, one\r\nof which is humanitarian while the other is political. On the\r\nhumanitarian level, the reports we continue to receive\r\ndescribe the atrocious human suffering of the Bosnian\r\npeople, especially at the hands of the Serb militias which\r\nwage terroristic campaigns in such places as Banja Luka\r\nand Bijeljina and through the “ethnic cleansing” that takes\r\nplace in the territories under Serb control. The report of the\r\nCommittee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in\r\ndocument A/48/18 and the report of the Special Rapporteur\r\nof the Commission on Human Rights situation in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia highlight the systematic and extensive\r\nviolations by the Serb militias of human rights and\r\ninternational humanitarian law, including the Geneva\r\nConventions and their Protocols. There is no doubt that the\r\ncontinuance of such crimes and human tragedies — even if\r\nit has not sufficed so far to awaken the conscience of\r\nEurope, or to alert us to the fact that such crimes put into\r\nquestion the very principle of collective security and\r\nundermine the credibility of the United Nations as the\r\nguardian of human rights — should suffice to alert us to\r\nthe very grave threat such unchecked criminality poses to\r\nall peace efforts.\r\nFrom the humanitarian point of view, my delegation\r\nwishes to make the following comments:\r\nFirst: there is a need for the international\r\ncommunity to commit itself to the intensification of its\r\nhumanitarian assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nespecially before the onset of winter. This requires the\r\nreopening of Tuzla airport because of its vital\r\nimportance with regard to the distribution of\r\nhumanitarian assistance in conformity with Security\r\nCouncil resolution 770 (1992). Here, we should like to\r\ncommend the sincere efforts of the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations and the\r\nUnited Nations Protection Force.\r\nSecond: there is an absolute need to force the\r\nSerb side to raise its siege of Sarajevo and other\r\ncities, as such siege constitutes a main source of\r\nhuman suffering and a main obstacle that impedes\r\nall peace efforts.\r\nThird: quick and effective action must be taken\r\nto put an end to the policy of “ethnic cleansing”, to\r\nbring the perpetrators of the crimes arising from that\r\npolicy before the international war crimes Tribunal,\r\nto nullify all the results on the ground of that policy,\r\nto affirm the right of all refugees and displaced\r\npersons of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to\r\nreturn to their homes, and to shut down all\r\nconcentration camps.\r\nFourth: the international war crimes Tribunal\r\nshould be strengthened, its members protected and\r\nall the parties concerned, especially the Serb side,\r\nshould be forced to facilitate its work and to\r\ncooperate with it.\r\nAs to the second facet of the tragedy, namely the\r\npolitical one, most of the General Assembly and Security\r\nCouncil resolutions have not been implemented and, to\r\ndate, have yielded no positive results in the search for a\r\npeaceful settlement to the issue, for the sole reason that\r\nthe Serb party has continued to enjoy military superiority\r\nover the Bosnian army. This is precisely why the Serbs\r\nhave continued to refuse to deal seriously with any of the\r\npeace efforts deployed by the international community\r\nwithin the framework of the International Conference on\r\nthe Former Yugoslavia and to reject every peace plan\r\nwhile all such plans have been accepted by the\r\nGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina although they\r\ninvariably reflected a tendency to appease the Serb\r\naggressors or even to bow to the fait accompli situation\r\nthe Serbs have continued to impose on the ground\r\nthrough their military superiority.\r\nThe most recent of those peace plans, the plan\r\nproposed by the Contact Group last July, did not diverge\r\nfrom that tendency: it gave the Serb aggressors\r\n49 per cent of the overall territory of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. Notwithstanding, the Bosnian Government\r\naccepted the plan while the Serbs rejected it. The only\r\nnew and rather encouraging element this time has been\r\nthe insistence of the Contact Group on forcing the Serbian\r\nparty to accept the plan, to the extent of hinting at certain\r\nmeasures to bring about such acceptance. Although the\r\nmeasures the countries, or some of the countries, of the\r\nContact Group seem to threaten the Serbs with do not\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\ninclude any collective security measures or any application\r\nof the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter and are no\r\nmore than a threat to the aggressor that the victim may\r\nactually be allowed to defend itself, we believe that it is a\r\nstep in the right direction on the part of the countries\r\ndealing with the problem.\r\nAt this level, we should like to make the following\r\ncomments:\r\nFirst: the ambitions and greed of the Serb\r\naggressors should be thwarted with firmness. They\r\nshould not be allowed this time to succeed in rejecting\r\nthe peace plan, as their aim is to continue to blackmail\r\nthe international community and thereby to obtain new\r\nconcessions at the expense of the principles of the\r\nCharter and of international law and the rights of the\r\npeople and Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe resolute stand we need in this respect is for the\r\nWestern Contact Group to honour its promise to take\r\nthe necessary measures to force the Serb party to\r\naccept the peace plan.\r\nSecond: the Contact Group, which acts on behalf\r\nof the international community in trying to arrive at a\r\npeaceful settlement to this crisis, must secure, in any\r\npeace plan, the legitimate rights of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina in accordance with the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and in particular its right to\r\nsovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.\r\nThird: the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina undermines the right of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to self-defence and breaches Article 51\r\nof the Charter which guarantees that right to all\r\nMember States. Here we wish to recall that resolution\r\n713 (1991) which imposed the arms embargo was\r\nacceptable in the context of the expectation that the\r\ninternational community would take upon itself the\r\ntask of defending the weaker party, an expectation\r\nwhich did not materialize regardless of the stipulation\r\nin Article 103 of the Charter that it is the obligation of\r\nthe Members of the United Nations under the Charter\r\nthat should prevail above all else. In the light of this,\r\nthe international community is called upon to shoulder\r\nits responsibilities under Article 24 of the Charter and\r\nprovide the necessary protection to and secure the\r\nlegitimate rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a State\r\nMember of the United Nations.\r\nFourth: it is the duty of the international\r\ncommunity to support the compromise solution\r\nproposed by the Government of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina namely the de jure lifting by the\r\nSecurity Council of the arms embargo, and the\r\ndeferment of the coming into effect of that lifting of\r\nthe embargo for six months in order to give the Serb\r\nside a chance to accept the peace plan. This proposal\r\nproves that the Government of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina prefers the political to the military\r\nsolution. Otherwise, that Government would not\r\nhave given such priority to persuading the Serbs to\r\naccept the peace plan.\r\nFifth: if it is agreed to lift the arms embargo,\r\nthe mandate of the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) should be amended, on the one hand,\r\nand, on the other, the areas wherein it is deployed\r\nshould be changed accordingly, in order to ensure its\r\nneutrality and stave off any possible danger that may\r\nthreaten its personnel.\r\nSixth: the mission of the International\r\nConference on the Former Yugoslavia in charge of\r\nmonitoring the borders between the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Serbia\r\nand Montenegro should ensure that resolution 943\r\n(1994) is respected and should immediately halt the\r\nimplementation of the Security Council resolution\r\nrelaxing the sanctions if Serbia and Montenegro do\r\nnot adhere to their own decision to hermetically\r\nclose their borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe draft resolution before us today\r\n(A/49/L.14/Rev.1) is yet another attempt to urge the\r\ninternational community to move towards the resolution\r\nin a balanced and equitable manner of this tragic\r\nsituation. We are among the sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution and we hope that all Member States will stand\r\nby the draft resolution and adopt it without a vote — in\r\norder to express the determination of the international\r\ncommunity to put an end to aggression against a Member\r\nState of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Al-Sameen (Oman) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): At the outset allow me, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Oman, to extend heartfelt thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Dr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali for his report on the situation in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina relating to agenda item 39, which is\r\nunder discussion today.\r\nAt a time when the United Nations is preparing to\r\ncelebrate its fiftieth anniversary, we still see parts of our\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nworld exposed to the most horrible forms of suffering, war\r\nand destruction. The ongoing onslaught on the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina today by the Serbs is an\r\naggression that targets that Republic’s sovereignty, its\r\nterritorial integrity, and the culture of its people in defiance\r\nof the numerous international resolutions adopted to this\r\ndate. The fact that this could take place leads us to say that\r\nalthough we are happy to see our Organization moving\r\nforward towards its fiftieth anniversary, we are extremely\r\nconcerned that the Bosnian Serbs should be able to continue\r\nto defy international resolutions and violate international\r\nhumanitarian law with impunity. Such barefaced violation\r\nand defiance throw into doubt the credibility of the United\r\nNations system. That such acts go unpunished while there\r\nare more than 60 United Nations resolutions on the\r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a regrettable\r\nsituation indeed.\r\nWhen we watch the suffering of the maimed, of\r\ndispersed families, of displaced persons, of detainees in\r\nSerbian horror camps and of the victims of collective rape;\r\nwhen we witness the use of ethnic cleansing as a weapon\r\nof war, when we hear of all the blatant violations of human\r\nrights perpetrated against specific segments of the\r\npopulation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Bihac, Gorazde\r\nand Tuzla, we should be encouraged to think again and take\r\na common stand that rejects such practices which run\r\ncounter to the most basic values of humanity. We should\r\ncall, once again, on the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs to\r\nrespond to the resolutions adopted by the international\r\ncommunity and to opt for peace through the unconditional\r\nacceptance of the peace plan proposed by the international\r\nContact Group which we consider to be a sound basis for\r\nsolving the problem while taking into account the interests\r\nof all parties and leading to the restoration of peace and\r\nstability to that part of Europe.\r\nMy delegation, through participation in the\r\ndeliberations of the Security Council, has time and again\r\nexpressed its full support for all peaceful efforts that would\r\nrestore peace and stability to the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. While we commend the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General, the Member States, the international\r\nContact Group, and the Contact Group of the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference, as well as the important role\r\nplayed by UNPROFOR, United Nations personnel and the\r\npersonnel of other humanitarian organizations who work\r\nunder extremely difficult conditions in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, we must renew our call to the United Nations\r\nto focus on implementing its resolutions and urgently to\r\nadopt a resolution exempting the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina from the arms embargo imposed by Security\r\nCouncil resolution 713 (1991).\r\nWhile we question the validity of maintaining the\r\nembargo against a sovereign State Member of the United\r\nNations, we wish to reiterate that it is the legitimate right\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina to defend itself in accordance\r\nwith Article 51 of the Charter. The right to self-defence\r\nis a legitimate, inalienable right. The delegation of Oman\r\nbelieves that it is the authority of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations that should prevail and must prevail, and\r\nthat any contradiction with any of its provisions should\r\nnullify any resolution or decision that runs counter to\r\nthose provisions regardless of the source of such\r\nresolution or decision. We take this position out of\r\nconcern for the credibility of the Organization, and\r\nbecause we do not wish to see any specific resolutions\r\ncreate grave precedents that could undermine that\r\ncredibility.\r\nIn view of the continuing Serb aggression against the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the continuing\r\nBosnian Serb rejection of all peace proposals, and\r\nbecause Security Council resolution 713 (1991) which\r\nimposed the arms embargo did not lead to the peaceful\r\nsettlement and the desired stability that were the raison\r\nd’être of its adoption, my delegation finds itself now,\r\nmore than at any other time in the past, supportive of the\r\ncall for the lifting of the arms embargo. My delegation,\r\ntherefore, supports the draft resolution recently put\r\nforward by the United States which is now under\r\ndiscussion in the Security Council, and which calls inter\r\nalia for the lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina. We believe that that draft resolution is\r\nmoderate and well-balanced, particularly as it responds to\r\nthe wise call by the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nearlier this session, to find a peaceful solution to the\r\ncrisis.\r\nWhile we recognize the services and the outstanding\r\nefforts of the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia and, in\r\nparticular, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we note that the\r\nconcept of protection and the very mandate of the Force\r\nare based upon Security Council resolutions, especially\r\nresolutions 824 (1993) and 836 (1993), which define the\r\nconcept and nature of protection, that is to say protection\r\nfor all the areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina and not just\r\nfor specific areas.\r\nWhile my delegation shares the concerns expressed\r\nby several countries regarding the revised concept of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\n“safe areas”, as that new definition could impinge upon the\r\nneed to protect other areas, we wish to highlight a more\r\nserious concern. That concern has to do with what is now\r\ncalled “the protected areas”. This could give rise to\r\nscattered protected pockets and thereby impinge on the\r\nlegitimacy and sovereignty of the Government of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina.\r\nWe therefore join others in calling for blanket\r\nprotection of the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand for expanding the mandate of UNPROFOR beyond the\r\nlimits of mere self-defence. The mandate should include the\r\nprovision of needed assistance to the Government of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina to enable it to protect its own people and\r\nto effectively stand up to any attacks or crimes perpetrated\r\nby the aggressor.\r\nAs regards the situation relating to UNPROFOR,\r\nshould the Security Council decide to exempt the Republic\r\nand Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the arms\r\nembargo imposed by resolution 713 (1991), my delegation’s\r\nview is that UNPROFOR’s presence should continue and,\r\nindeed, should be increased, for this would improve the\r\nchances of finding a peaceful settlement to the conflict in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Should any troop-contributing\r\ncountry decide to withdraw troops from UNPROFOR, it\r\nwould be sending the wrong signal to the parties and would\r\nbe weakening the concerted international stand that aims at\r\nfinding a peaceful solution.\r\nBy its resolution 827 (1993), the Security Council\r\nestablished the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of\r\nPersons Responsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991. Even though the work of\r\nthe Tribunal has been rather slow, yet my delegation\r\nsupports its activities and hopes that those activities will\r\ndemonstrate to the international community that those who\r\nwould commit horrific crimes against humanity and defy\r\ninternational laws, conventions and norms will not go\r\nunpunished wherever they may be. My delegation supports\r\nthe Tribunal and the Council’s decision to name Judge\r\nGoldstone as prosecutor. Indeed, the mere existence of the\r\nTribunal should serve as a deterrent to any who would\r\nthink that such crimes could be perpetrated with impunity.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation, proceeding from its\r\nsupport for the stand of the international community and the\r\nlegitimate rights of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nhas, for the second time, sponsored a draft resolution that\r\nis now before the Assembly, and that, in our view, contains\r\npositive elements.\r\nMr. Jerandi (Tunisia) (interpretation from French):\r\nAllow me to congratulate the President yet again on the\r\nexemplary manner in which he is conducting the work of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nSince the General Assembly has been seized of the\r\ntragedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, many delegations,\r\nincluding my own, have come to this rostrum or gone to\r\nthe Security Council or to various other international and\r\nregional forums to add their voices to the appeals to the\r\ninternational community to take resolute and vigorous\r\naction in response to the aggression against a State\r\nMember of our Organization. Appeal followed appeal,\r\nresolution followed resolution, and now ultimatums have\r\nlost their meaning and effectiveness, and the credibility of\r\nour Organization and its capacity to respond to aggression\r\nby appropriate means have been trampled underfoot by\r\nthe Serbs — that is the situation today, after three years\r\nof systematic aggression.\r\nPressure, condemnations, warnings, sanctions and\r\nisolation have not succeeded in convincing the Serbs to\r\nput an end to their murderous campaign and their constant\r\nbreaking of promises.\r\nOn several occasions my delegation has alerted our\r\nOrganization on the serious repercussions and\r\nconsequences of the lack of will and decisive measures to\r\ncurb the deterioration of the situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. Each time we have emphasized that half\r\nmeasures send no message to the Serbs, who have chosen\r\nthe abominable road of “ethnic cleansing” to bring about\r\nthe disappearance of a civilization, an entire people and\r\na State Member of our Organization.\r\nHence, we called for the adoption of emergency\r\nmeasures to guarantee the full implementation of\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly and of the Security\r\nCouncil, many of which fall under Chapter VII, including,\r\ninter alia, Security Council resolutions 824 (1993) and\r\n836 (1993), which call for the use of all necessary means,\r\nincluding military means, to protect the “safe areas”.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations and the principles\r\nof international law offer the international community a\r\nbasis for the use of all means available to it to face up to\r\nthis blatant aggression against a Member of our\r\nOrganization, to ensure respect for the norms of\r\ninternational conduct, to see that justice is done for the\r\nvictims and to restore to their rightful owners the lands\r\nthat have been taken by force.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nNothing has really been done. What is more, we can\r\nsee, unfortunately, that our Organization is caught in the\r\ntrap of its own silence. As a result, if we are not careful,\r\naggression will become commonplace and we shall simply\r\nlook on, impassive and resigned, as a series of horrors\r\ncontinues ruthlessly to ravage that multi-ethnic, multiracial\r\nand multireligious land.\r\nThe Serbian war machine continues implacably along\r\nits route of death and devastation. Massacres and “ethnic\r\ncleansing” are increasing in ferocity. The “safe areas” are\r\nconstantly violated. The personnel of the United Nations\r\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR) is attacked. Humanitarian\r\nconvoys are blocked. And, finally, the whole effort agreed\r\nupon by the international community to seek an acceptable\r\nsolution through the Contact Group’s plan is simply\r\ndoomed to failure because, quite obviously, of the constant\r\ndefiance and obstinacy of the Serbs.\r\nWe continue to believe that these acts of madness\r\ncould have been prevented had the international community,\r\nthe Security Council, the regional institutions and individual\r\nGovernments had acted in time with the necessary resolve\r\nand commitment.\r\nAlthough my delegation respects and appreciates the\r\nreal value of the frequent initiatives of our Organization and\r\nof certain Member States to promote the search for a\r\npeaceful solution to this tragedy, it feels that the virtue of\r\npatience — which has been shown to excess vis-à-vis this\r\ntragedy — should not excuse our Organization, most\r\nespecially the Security Council, from its primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance and protection of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAssistance operations and the provision of\r\nhumanitarian aid should not be, in our view, a source of\r\npride for our Organization unless they are accompanied by\r\nserious and effective measures that can alter the\r\nexpansionist designs of the Serbs and guarantee the survival\r\nand safety of a State Member of our Organization and\r\npreserve its territorial integrity.\r\nMr. Idris (Sudan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe time has come to enable Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nto exercise fully its right, under Article 51 of the Charter,\r\nto take matters into its own hands and fight for its own\r\nsurvival. How long can we continue to deny the Bosniacs\r\naccess to the means of protecting themselves as a nation\r\nand a sovereign people? It is unacceptable and morally\r\nreprehensible for a people to be at once disarmed and\r\nunprotected because of international inaction.\r\nIn this context, we support the United States\r\ninitiative to bring this matter before the Security Council,\r\nwhich is the only way resolution 713 (1991) can be\r\nreviewed in relation to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s right to\r\nself-defence, now that it seems not to have been possible\r\nto contain the Serbs and to have them live up to their\r\ncommitments. We trust that this time firmness will prevail\r\nand that all members of the international community will\r\nbe unanimous in their approach so that the aggression can\r\nbe stopped and legitimacy can be restored. The credibility\r\nof our Organization and our ability to ensure respect for\r\nits Charter are at stake.\r\nMr. Seydou (Niger) (interpretation from French): In\r\nits 11 October statement before the General Assembly\r\nduring the general debate, the delegation of Niger\r\nexpressed its deep concern over the situation in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina. Today’s debate on agenda item 39 gives\r\nus an opportunity to reaffirm Niger’s position on the\r\naggression against a victim that is a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations — the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina — and to state again that the efforts\r\nundertaken thus far by the international community have\r\nnot, unfortunately, been able to halt that aggression.\r\nNiger attaches great importance to respect for the\r\nideals and principles enshrined in the Charter of our\r\nOrganization, particularly those concerning respect for the\r\ndignity of the human person and respect for the\r\nindependence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of\r\nStates. This is why my country cannot countenance the\r\nSerbs’ violation of these fundamental principles with\r\nimpunity since they took up their war of hegemony\r\nagainst Bosnia and Herzegovina, using in their strategy of\r\noccupation and “ethnic cleansing” all methods condemned\r\nby the international community, methods that the world\r\nthought had been relegated to the dustbin of history.\r\nNiger is concerned that on the eve of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of our Organization a people can be\r\nmassacred and stripped of its rights, that it can be given\r\nno appropriate international protection and that, in view\r\nof this regrettable failing, it is not given an opportunity to\r\nexercise its inherent right to self-defence, although that\r\nright is enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\r\nLast year, in resolution 48/88, the General Assembly\r\nurged, inter alia, that the Security Council, in keeping\r\nwith Article 24 of the Charter, ensure the restoration of\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nthe political independence and territorial integrity and unity\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nBut the truth is that so far neither the resolutions of\r\nthe Council nor the many initiatives of the Contact Group\r\nhave been able to halt the massacre of civilians by Serbs or\r\nthe siege of Sarajevo or to ensure respect for the so-called\r\nsafe areas, although these were created by the Security\r\nCouncil itself. Instead, as if to reward the Serbs for their\r\nintransigence, the Security Council, in resolution 943\r\n(1994), decided to ease the sanctions against the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).\r\nIn my delegation’s opinion, that decision, which was\r\ntaken in haste — haste which the situation at that time did\r\nnot in any way justify — will not help to lay the\r\nfoundations of a just and lasting peace in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. We believe that such a decision would have\r\nhad merit only if the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had\r\naccepted the internationally recognized borders of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, Croatia and all the other States in the\r\nregion.\r\nMy country welcomes the position taken up by the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America, which\r\nconstitutes a clear and firm message to the Serb side. Niger\r\nonce again welcomes the political courage and far-\r\nsightedness that has always been displayed by President\r\nAlija Izetbegović and supports his proposal — made right\r\nhere on 29 September last — that there be a de jure lifting\r\nof the arms embargo imposed against the Government of\r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Security\r\nCouncil resolution 713 (1991). That course decided upon by\r\nthe Bosnian Government, far from having been chosen out\r\nof desperation, would be a fair compromise aimed at\r\nsecuring, at last, recognition of the victim’s legitimate right\r\nto preserve its territorial integrity and sovereignty.\r\nAccordingly, it should be supported by us all.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to say, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Niger, that for countries such as mine, which\r\ncan ensure their security only on the basis of respect for the\r\nprinciples of international law and the effective\r\nimplementation of the resolutions of the United Nations —\r\nin particular, those adopted under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter — the tragic experience of Bosnia is a disturbing\r\nand worrying precedent.\r\nThis precedent, which seems to put the stamp of\r\napproval on the rule of might over right, can no longer be\r\ntolerated. It is my delegation’s hope that the Assembly, by\r\nproviding massive support for the draft resolution before us,\r\nwill clearly demonstrate its determination to fulfil the\r\nresponsibility entrusted to it under the Charter in the field\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nMr. Snoussi (Morocco) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): We meet to consider yet again the tragic\r\nsituation that the Muslim people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina are still experiencing. Since the outbreak of\r\narmed conflict in Bosnia the situation has only worsened,\r\nand the human suffering and losses have increased despite\r\nall the efforts of the international community and despite\r\nthe many and varied measures taken by the Security\r\nCouncil, the principal United Nations organ responsible\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe impressive number of Security Council\r\nresolutions — some of them adopted under Chapter VII\r\nof the Charter — and the many presidential statements\r\nconcerning the tragic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nhave not succeeded either in dissuading the Serbs from\r\nmassacring Bosnian civilians or in persuading them to\r\nlisten to the voice of reason and wisdom.\r\nAll the international community’s efforts to preserve\r\nthe territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina have led nowhere because of the\r\nintransigence of the Serbs and their persistence in\r\npursuing aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nwhich clearly constitutes a grave threat to international\r\npeace and security and a flagrant violation of the\r\nfundamental principles of international law. Indeed, the\r\nSerbs, flouting all the resolutions and decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council and defying the entire international\r\ncommunity, have coldly and cruelly pursued their policy\r\nof occupation, “ethnic cleansing” and expulsion of\r\nMuslims. Television and the press give us day after day\r\ngood reasons to have a guilty conscience, with often vivid\r\nreporting of the continual massacres of these courageous\r\npeople.\r\nSince the beginning of this tragedy my country has\r\nunceasingly called, in every United Nations body, for full\r\nrecognition of the need to enable this unarmed people to\r\nhave at its disposal the necessary means to ensure self-\r\ndefence and the restoration of its territorial integrity and\r\nsovereignty. To demonstrate its solidarity with the kindred\r\nBosnian people, Morocco has always advocated the lifting\r\nof the embargo imposed on that State, which, it should be\r\nremembered, is a full Member of our Organization.\r\nThe various resolutions of the Security Council have,\r\nindeed, recognized that Bosnia and Herzegovina is a\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nvictim of Serbian aggression — aggression that it has not\r\nbeen possible to halt, even through the many measures\r\ntaken by the Security Council. Hence the need to\r\nsupplement these measures by authorizing that country to\r\nacquire the means to ensure its self-defence and to exclude\r\nit from the scope of resolution 713 (1991), which provides\r\nfor an arms embargo against the whole of the former\r\nYugoslavia with a view to avoiding any perverse\r\nimpression.\r\nThe lifting of the arms embargo should be envisaged\r\nas complementary to the measures already adopted by the\r\nSecurity Council and the very effective and courageous\r\naction of the United Nations Protection Force. This could\r\nbe the means of restoring the balance that is necessary to\r\nthe success of the negotiations aimed at securing a just and\r\nlasting solution that would safeguard the territorial integrity,\r\nindependence and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe international community cannot allow aggression\r\nto be rewarded and a fait accompli to be legitimized. In this\r\nconnection, Security Council resolution 943 (1994) —\r\nadopted on 23 September under Chapter VII of the United\r\nNations Charter — which suspends, for an initial period of\r\n100 days, some of the sanctions imposed on the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), was not\r\nwelcomed with relief by everyone, as many people consider\r\nit a hasty reward for the aggressor. It would have been\r\nbetter to wait for real progress in the peace process before\r\neasing the sanctions imposed on the Serbs.\r\nThe Bosnian Government, for its part, cannot\r\nindefinitely be prevented from acquiring the necessary\r\nmeans of maintaining its territorial integrity and of ensuring\r\nrespect for its independence, or even seeking the aid that it\r\nneeds for this purpose. The international community has not\r\nsucceeded in helping the Bosnian Government to achieve\r\nthis objective, despite the cooperation and flexibility shown\r\nthroughout the conflict by that Government. In these\r\ncircumstances, it remains only for the international\r\ncommunity to authorize the Bosnian Government to acquire\r\nthe means of ensuring the safety of its civilians and the\r\nrecovery of its territory.\r\nMorocco firmly supports the draft resolution before us\r\non the lifting of the embargo. For two and a half years we\r\nhave been calling for this measure to be taken by the\r\ninternational community. We hope that flexibility on the\r\npart of the countries still hesitating will enable us to put an\r\nend to this injustice imposed on the Bosnian Government.\r\nWithout any doubt, this would help to deter the Serbs and\r\nto make them see reason and accept the plan that was\r\npresented by the Contact Group and has already been\r\naccepted by the Bosnian Government.\r\nMoreover, the right to self-defence is enshrined in\r\nArticle 51 of the Charter, which states:\r\n“Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the\r\ninherent right of individual or collective self-defence\r\nif an armed attack occurs against a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations”.\r\nMy delegation wishes to express its appreciation for\r\nthe tireless efforts made by the Secretary-General, by the\r\ntwo Co-Chairmen of the International Conference and by\r\nthe Contact Group. We also wish to pay a heartfelt tribute\r\nto the courageous men and women of the United Nations\r\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR) and the personnel of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) and of the other humanitarian\r\norganizations which have been helping to cope with this\r\ndisaster.\r\nMr. Kulla (Albania) (interpretation from French):\r\nI would first like to emphasize that the international\r\ncommunity has never had any doubt regarding the origin\r\nof the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina or that we must\r\nspeed up our joint efforts to find a solution. The conflict\r\ninvolves questions of the application — or\r\nnon-application — of basic norms and principles, which\r\nhave an impact on all the other elements of the crisis in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia.\r\nHowever, our biggest concern, along with the\r\nsuffering caused by great human losses and incalculable\r\nmaterial damage is the fact that this conflict involves\r\nviolations of the basic principles underlying contemporary\r\ninternational relations, principles that are the basis of the\r\nCharter and the Helsinki Final Act. If, through lack of\r\nresolve or ineptitude, we allow this reality to become an\r\nestablished fact, we shall clearly have established a\r\nprecedent that is very dangerous for the Balkans and\r\nbeyond and thus have allowed events to take a wrong\r\nturning.\r\nIn spite of all the talk, the many decisions,\r\ndeclarations and resolutions, and the various peace plans\r\nthat have been drafted but never implemented, the\r\ninternational community is again faced with failure, as\r\nrecent events show.\r\nThe situation has certainly been influenced by the\r\nlack of political will behind efforts to find solutions, by\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\ndiffering points of view and by the absence of prompt and\r\nfirm action to enforce implementation of measures decided\r\nupon, and these factors have encouraged aggressive Serbian\r\nnationalism. It is also clear to everybody that the attitude\r\ntowards the arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia\r\nwas detrimental only to the victims of the conflict — the\r\nBosnians. We welcome the initiative of the United States in\r\nputting before the Security Council a draft resolution on\r\nlifting the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nand we urge the Council to give serious consideration to\r\nthis matter.\r\nThe Serbian side’s refusal to cooperate with the\r\ninternational community, its intransigence and its rejection\r\nof every peace plan and all decisions and resolutions led the\r\ninternational community some time ago to consider\r\nrecourse to appropriate measures under the Charter. There\r\nhave been many violations of the air space of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the safe areas and the exclusion zone around\r\nSarajevo — as we have seen recently. All in all, the dead-\r\nend into which they have led the international community,\r\nas well as the successive violations of all the norms\r\ngoverning international relations, demanded more than\r\nsporadic air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO), which in fact warned rather than\r\npunished the aggressors.\r\nSerbian rejection was also responsible for the failure\r\nof the Contact Group’s efforts to find a solution to the\r\ncrisis. It is abundantly clear that without the resolve of the\r\ninternational community, without a combination of intensive\r\ndiplomacy and other relevant means, the prospects for\r\npeace are even more remote.\r\nBut there is one fundamental thing to be done — the\r\nimplementation of measures already decided upon. That is\r\nthe only way in which we should be communicating with\r\nthose who deny the fundamental principles of international\r\nlaw and who arbitrarily arrogate to themselves the right to\r\ndetermine the fate of others. This must be the message to\r\nthe aggressor; it is the only way to do justice and achieve\r\nthe desired solution.\r\nAlbania unreservedly supported the establishment of\r\nthe International Tribunal to prosecute those responsible for\r\nwar crimes in the former Yugoslavia, and calls for its\r\nmandate to be speedily implemented. It is absolutely\r\nimperative that those responsible for “ethnic cleansing” and\r\nother abominable crimes in the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia be individually brought to justice and punished\r\nappropriately. This would confirm international resolve not\r\nto tolerate “ethnic cleansing” or other crimes against\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe adoption of Security Council resolution 943\r\n(1994) on easing the sanctions against Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, when it had not met the basic conditions for\r\neven discussing the lifting of the embargo, was a\r\nconcession to the Milosevic regime, casting doubt on the\r\npossibility of any resolution of the Yugoslav crisis and\r\nthe establishment of lasting peace throughout the region.\r\nWe hope that that action was not premature and that it\r\nwill bring the desired result. But it is perfectly clear to\r\nthe Belgrade regime, as the party solely responsible for\r\nthe aggression, as its sole inspiration and promoter, what\r\nmeasures it must take to bring its people prosperity and\r\na return to the family of nations. It is clear that unless it\r\nrenounces implementation of the memorandum of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences of Serbia, recognizes the former\r\nYugoslav Republics within internationally recognized\r\nborders and respects the will of the Albanian people of\r\nKosovo we should not consider lifting the sanctions\r\nregime or bringing Serbia and Montenegro back into the\r\nfamily of nations.\r\nIt is widely known and generally accepted that\r\nprevention is better than cure. Prevention is also easier\r\nand — this has a bearing on one of the most burning\r\nproblems facing the Organization — less expensive.\r\nIn this context I should like to recall that Kosovo,\r\nwhere more than 2 million people of Albanian stock live,\r\nis increasingly threatened by an outbreak of conflict. It is\r\nessential to take measures to establish an appropriate\r\ninternational presence there in order to prevent an even\r\ngreater tragedy. It must be acknowledged that since the\r\nexpulsion of the mission of the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) nothing has been\r\ndone to bring about its return, something that the\r\ninternational community has always favoured, and no\r\nprogress has been made in improving the situation in\r\nKosovo. On the contrary, according to reports from the\r\nCSCE troika following visits to Kosovo, the situation\r\nthere is alarming, Serbian violence and repression having\r\nintensified since August 1993.\r\nWe firmly believe that the United Nations has the\r\ncapacity to take preventive measures in Kosovo to avert\r\na conflict. Action that it has not been possible to take in\r\nother parts of the former Yugoslavia must be taken\r\nswiftly in Kosovo and be effective.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nFinally, I would like to express my delegation’s full\r\nsupport for the draft resolution, which we hope will be\r\nadopted by an overwhelming majority.\r\nMr. Andreev (Bulgaria): The war in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is one of the most serious conflicts of the\r\npresent day and as such it represents a challenge to the\r\nUnited Nations at the end of the twentieth century. It is of\r\nvital importance for my country, a neighbouring State of\r\nthis troubled area, that a speedy, lasting and just solution be\r\nfound on the basis of a mutually acceptable agreement,\r\nwithout any negative consequences for the future of the\r\nregion.\r\nIt is obvious that in order to achieve this goal a\r\ndecisive step has to be taken to put an immediate end to the\r\nwar. All parties to the conflict should make the necessary\r\ncompromises to this end. The cessation of hostilities should\r\nbe effected without delay, for it is hardly possible to\r\nimagine any fruitful political decision being implemented in\r\nthe absence of this precondition. Bulgaria will continue to\r\nsupport the endeavours of the international community in\r\nthis direction.\r\nThe war in Bosnia and Herzegovina has revealed\r\nmany important and complex problems the solution of\r\nwhich will, in our opinion, influence the approach of the\r\nUnited Nations to similar situations that may arise —\r\nalthough this is not to be desired — in the future.\r\nFirst, we have been witnessing the abhorrent practice\r\nof “ethnic cleansing” in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bulgaria\r\nregards this practice as unacceptable and is of the view that\r\nit will constitute a precedent with unforeseeable\r\nconsequences, not only for the new States which have\r\nemerged on the territory of former Yugoslavia but for the\r\nBalkans as a whole. If this process were left without any\r\nreaction from the international community, it would amount\r\nto silent acceptance of the policy of fait accompli. It would\r\nalso mean condoning the acquisition of new territories by\r\nmilitary force. Bulgaria could hardly champion that.\r\nSecondly, we believe that the conduct of all countries\r\nneighbouring the zone of conflict should be conducive to its\r\nsettlement. With the benefit of our historical experience, we\r\nhave called upon all Balkan countries not to participate with\r\nmilitary force in any hostilities in former Yugoslavia. For\r\nour part, we went even further by declaring that we would\r\nnot be involved in any military activities on the territory of\r\nformer Yugoslavia, either directly or indirectly, or even\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. Let me assure the\r\nAssembly that this is not because of a lack of support for\r\nthe efforts of the Organization. It is our knowledge of the\r\nhistory of the region and our desire to contribute to the\r\npeace process that determines the position I have just set\r\nforth. For this reason, we have also stated that we are\r\nagainst the formation of any kind of axis in the region,\r\nwhich we regard as a practice of the past.\r\nThirdly, we are concerned at the possibility of a\r\nspillover of the conflict to other areas or countries in the\r\nregion, especially to the south-east. Peace is quite fragile\r\nthere, and for this reason we support full recourse to the\r\ninstruments of preventive diplomacy. Therefore we view\r\nthe presence of the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) in Macedonia as a good example, for it\r\nserves as a stabilizing factor that helps to localize the\r\nconflict and prevent its possible spillover.\r\nBearing in mind my country’s position of principle\r\nof supporting all international efforts aimed at finding a\r\nsolution to the conflict, Bulgaria has welcomed the\r\ncooperation of this Organization, the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, the\r\nUnited States of America and the Russian Federation to\r\nthis end. Even more important, it is a clear signal that\r\nwhen the international community takes active and\r\ncoordinated steps, mutually acceptable solutions can be\r\nfound.\r\nThe signing of the Washington Agreements was an\r\nimportant act in the positive process of resolving the\r\nconflict. We hope that the process will be completed\r\ndespite the difficulties.\r\nOn these lines, we endorse the important role of the\r\npeace-keeping forces under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. At the same time, in deciding on the problem of\r\nthe composition of UNPROFOR we should take into\r\nconsideration the need to increase its personnel, in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 900 (1994),\r\nas well as the prospects for future stability in the region;\r\nwe must avoid fostering an environment conducive to\r\nincreasing suspicions and mutual claims, which would\r\ngive rise to new “cold” or to “hot” conflicts.\r\nBulgaria declared its support for the peace plan of\r\nthe Contact Group. We consider it a good basis for\r\ncompromise in the search for a peaceful solution to the\r\nconflict. The refusal of the Bosnian Serbs to accept the\r\nplan may turn out to be the obstacle on the way to\r\nachieving peace in the region, and we think that their\r\nleaders must bear an enormous responsibility in that\r\nrespect. Once again we call upon them to accept the\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nproposals of the Contact Group, which will open prospects\r\nfor reviving cooperation in the region and will help the\r\nBalkan States to be gradually integrated into the European\r\nprocesses and structures.\r\nAt the same time, Bulgaria continues to express the\r\nhope that the members of the Contact Group, and especially\r\nthe permanent members of the Security Council, will\r\ncarefully weigh the pros and cons of lifting the arms\r\nembargo vis-à-vis the Government of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The influx of new weapons may\r\nlead to an escalation of the hostilities in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and to their possible spread to other,\r\nneighbouring territories.\r\nAs a result of the good cooperation between the\r\nmembers of the Contact Group, we have recently noted\r\nsome encouraging elements in the position of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) regarding\r\nthe conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The deployment of\r\ninternational observers along the border of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and the territory of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina under the control of the Bosnian Serbs made\r\nit possible to suspend the sanctions partially. This is\r\nconsidered to be a positive step on the way to the complete\r\nlifting of the sanctions, which are placing such a heavy\r\nburden on the economy of my country.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like once again to state that\r\nBulgaria is ready to contribute to the efforts of the\r\ninternational community in the process of finding a lasting\r\nand peaceful solution to the conflict in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nMr. Kovanda (Czech Republic): The developments in\r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina have caused\r\nanguish in the Czech Republic from the very beginning of\r\nthe war. The feelings of the Czech people have been\r\nrepeatedly expressed in numerous statements by\r\nPresident Vaclav Havel and Foreign Minister Josef\r\nZieleniec, and in this very Hall as well as in the Security\r\nCouncil. They have also been expressed in the Czech\r\nRepublic’s contribution of almost 1,000 men to the United\r\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), and in its\r\nlong-standing readiness to have a Unit transferred to the\r\nBosnian theatre. Even more telling perhaps are private\r\nefforts of Czech citizens who have sent truckload after\r\ntruckload of relief to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nNobody can therefore doubt the motives that inform\r\nthe policies of the Czech Republic. We have steadfastly\r\nsupported the unity and territorial integrity of the Republic.\r\nWe have welcomed the creation of the Federation. We\r\nhave cried out against “ethnic cleansing”. Czech\r\nauthorities have throughout maintained high-level contacts\r\nwith the leadership of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nWe are encouraged by a number of positive\r\ndevelopments that have taken place in the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina since we spoke in this forum a\r\nyear ago. The creation and step-by-step consolidation of\r\nthe Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, between the\r\nBosniac and the Croat areas of the country, has\r\nfar-reaching consequences. On the military side, it has led\r\nto the end of fratricidal fighting. On the humanitarian\r\nside, it has improved the situation of thousands who a\r\nyear ago had been trapped in the despair of Mostar and\r\nother places. On the political side, it has demonstrated\r\nthat the principle of coexistence of differing ethnic groups\r\nis not dead even in these most cruelly trying\r\ncircumstances.\r\nThe Federation remains open to Serb-controlled\r\nareas of the Republic, but has had the effect of a greater\r\nisolation of these areas. Their self-proclaimed leaders can\r\nno longer exploit differences between Bosniacs and\r\nCroats.\r\nThe isolation of the Bosnian Serbs was, however,\r\ndeepened even further when the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) accepted the Contact\r\nGroup’s plan and closed off its borders with the Republic\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is precisely in continuing\r\nand strengthening the isolation of the Bosnian Serbs that\r\nwe now see the best way out. That is why this past\r\nSeptember the Czech Republic supported not only\r\nSecurity Council resolution 941 (1994), which yet again\r\ncondemned “ethnic cleansing” and related phenomena in\r\nmuch the same language as today’s draft resolution does,\r\nbut also co-sponsored Security Council resolution 942\r\n(1994), which tightened the sanctions on the Bosnian\r\nSerbs. In a day or two, the Security Council will receive\r\nanother certification from the Co-Chairmen of the\r\nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia\r\n(ICFY) about the results of the border-monitoring process.\r\nSo far, we have heard nothing substantive that would cast\r\ndoubts on the seriousness with which the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia is keeping the border closed. But\r\nlet me reiterate that the isolation of the Bosnian Serbs is\r\nnot an end in itself. Rather, it is an exercise directed at\r\nforcing them to accept the Contact Group territorial\r\narrangement for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nSix weeks ago, during the discussion of the resolutions\r\nwe have mentioned, we made a point that my Foreign\r\nMinister also reiterated during this year’s general debate:\r\none of the most useful next steps for settling the situation\r\nin the former Yugoslavia would be the mutual recognition\r\nof the several States in the area, within their internationally\r\nrecognized borders. And one side effect of the sealing of its\r\nborder with the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia is that it amounts to a de\r\nfacto recognition of at least the border that those two States\r\nshare. Surely de jure recognition should follow without\r\nfurther delay.\r\nThe points I have made so far indicate the great\r\nsympathy that my delegation has for the issues dealt with\r\nin the draft resolution before us. Nevertheless, even if we\r\nagreed with every single one of its other numerous\r\nparagraphs, we would still have difficulties with operative\r\nparagraph 22. They are procedural, technical and\r\nsubstantive.\r\nFirst, with regard to the procedural difficulty, the\r\nSecurity Council, too, is about to discuss a draft resolution\r\nconcerning lifting the arms embargo against the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The discussion will be a very\r\nearnest one, and I would not want to anticipate its outcome.\r\nNevertheless, as a member of the Security Council, the\r\nCzech Republic does not wish to bind itself in advance of\r\nthat discussion, even if only morally, by voting in favour of\r\na draft resolution in the General Assembly calling on the\r\nSecurity Council to reach a specific outcome.\r\nSecondly, there is a technical difficulty. The Czech\r\nRepublic does not believe it helpful for the Security\r\nCouncil to take a binding decision to apply a particular\r\nmeasure at a specific time in the future. Recently we made\r\nthis point when debating the continuation of sanctions\r\nimposed on Iraq. At that time, too, we did not think it wise\r\nfor the Council to take a binding decision, with whatever\r\nconditionalities might be attached, on a specific course of\r\naction to be taken six months later. We did not think it\r\nwise then, we do not think it wise now.\r\nThirdly, with regard to the substantive difficulty —\r\nwhich we consider most important — my Government does\r\nnot believe that lifting the arms embargo would improve the\r\noverall situation. This situation in the Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina cannot be viewed in isolation. And it is\r\nour opinion that the situation in the region as a whole\r\nwould deteriorate. We fear that fighting would escalate\r\nthroughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that it\r\nwould engulf many United Nations protected areas in\r\nCroatia, that it would jeopardize the United Nations\r\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR) and interrupt\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nFor all those reasons, my delegation will abstain in\r\nthe vote on the draft resolution.\r\nMr. Taher (Bangladesh): Bangladesh’s position on\r\nthe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been\r\nconsistent and categorical. We are deeply committed to\r\nstrengthening all efforts towards a negotiated settlement\r\naimed at restoring peace to the entire territory of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina and preserving its territorial unity and\r\nintegrity within its internationally recognized borders,\r\nincluding all occupied areas.\r\nWe cannot but strongly underscore that what is at\r\nstake is the fate of not only Bosnia and Herzegovina but\r\nalso all weaker and smaller States Members of this great\r\nOrganization. At issue here is the very credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations, and particularly that of the Security\r\nCouncil, in upholding the immutable principles of the\r\nCharter — in this case, the sovereignty, political\r\nindependence and territorial integrity of a sovereign\r\nMember of the United Nations, and particularly that of\r\nthe inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory through\r\nthe use of force. Respect for human rights and the\r\nsanctity of borders are also integral elements in these\r\nprinciples and in the search for any lasting political\r\nsolution. It goes without saying that Bangladesh fully\r\nreaffirms the rights provided in the United Nations\r\nCharter and, particularly applicable in the present case of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the inherent right of self-defence\r\nunder Article 51 of the Charter.\r\nThe current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nremains one of deep concern, especially in the wake of its\r\npast history and the continuing prevalence of unprovoked\r\narmed hostilities, indiscriminate acts of bombing and the\r\nuse of poisonous gases, the strangulation by siege of\r\nmajor cities, safe areas and exclusion zones and violations\r\nof international humanitarian law tantamount to genocide.\r\nNo one can doubt that the objective was nothing less than\r\nthe systematic dismemberment of a country which is a\r\nsovereign, independent Member of the United Nations.\r\nWe have welcomed efforts by the Security Council\r\nand the Contact Group to create the groundwork for a\r\npeaceful settlement in difficult circumstances, including\r\ncease-fire arrangements and deterrent measures. We\r\ncannot but be conscious, however, that the responses to\r\nthe evolving situation have often been too little and too\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nlate. They have been characterized by hesitation, ex post\r\nfacto rationalization, piecemeal and ad hoc responses, lack\r\nof anticipation and lack of political will to implement\r\ndecisions taken. Such an approach has in no way deterred,\r\nbut indeed encouraged, the Serbs in their continued\r\nencroachment on territory, calculated duplicity and\r\nbypassing of agreements. Violations of the cease-fire,\r\nunprovoked attacks on United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) personnel and the tightening of the siege of\r\nSarajevo continue. The aim of enforcing the comprehensive\r\ncessation of the hostilities and of extending safe havens all\r\nover Bosnia and Herzegovina is far from being realized.\r\nHuman misery and suffering continue on an unprecedented\r\nscale, with thousands of refugees and displaced persons.\r\nThrough its resolutions the General Assembly has\r\nsought to serve as the conscience of humanity in\r\napproaching remedial solutions. There continues to be a\r\nlarge variance between the gauge established by the\r\nAssembly and actions taken by the Council. It is vitally\r\nimportant for the Security Council to take purposeful\r\nremedial action on all fronts in a concerted and coordinated\r\nmanner, be the measures political, military, legal, economic\r\nor humanitarian.\r\nIt is in this context that Bangladesh would like to\r\nhighlight what it considers to be the indispensable elements\r\nfor moving towards a resolution of the problem.\r\nFirst and foremost, we have all repeatedly reaffirmed\r\nthe need to preserve and protect the territorial integrity and\r\npolitical independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All\r\nSerbian-controlled parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be\r\nreintegrated into the rest of the country. Efforts to integrate\r\noccupied areas under any form of control or administrative\r\nsystem of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia contributing\r\nto de facto occupation must be rejected as illegal. Similarly,\r\nall actions and declarations made under duress are null and\r\nvoid, especially with regard to property and land ownership.\r\nSecondly, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must\r\nactively demonstrate its bona fides by overt acts of\r\nrestitution. Its declared support for the Contact Group peace\r\nproposal must be substantiated by its readiness to mutually\r\nrecognize Bosnia and Herzegovina; to comply with relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council, including cessation of\r\nany military or logistic support to the Bosnian Serbs; to\r\nrespect the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\r\nand to stop and reverse the efforts to integrate occupied\r\nareas into the fold of its own authority. Failure to conform\r\nto these fundamental measures must immediately lead to\r\nthe termination of the partial suspension of sanctions\r\nagainst the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\r\nThirdly, Bangladesh has always strongly supported\r\nthe lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, consistent with guarantees laid down for all\r\nStates in Article 51 of the Charter. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the compromise offer of the Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina to seek de jure lifting of the arms\r\nembargo, with effective application deferred up to six\r\nmonths. It is our considered opinion that in the absence\r\nof sustained pressure on both the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia and the Bosnian Serbs progress towards a\r\npeaceful settlement will remain a pious wish.\r\nFourthly, we strongly support the safeguarding and\r\nextension of the exclusion zones so that the whole of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina can be declared a safe haven.\r\nFifthly, we believe that it is important that\r\nUNPROFOR be strengthened, not only in numbers, but\r\nalso in terms of its specific mandate to deter aggression,\r\nprotect exclusion zones and check unlawful access of\r\ngoods and contraband materials along the border with the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. Unimpeded access of\r\nUnited Nations and UNPROFOR personnel must be\r\naccorded in all areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nespecially to check and stop “ethnic cleansing” and the\r\npersistent campaign of terror that is continuing.\r\nSixthly, on the humanitarian front all efforts must be\r\nundertaken to facilitate the unhindered flow of\r\nhumanitarian assistance, particularly in the safe areas, and\r\nmeasures for the restoration, rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Immediate\r\nsteps must be taken to open Tuzla airport. Detention and\r\nconcentration camps established by the Serbs must be\r\ndismantled and free access be given to the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross and humanitarian institutions\r\nto check the welfare of all persons imprisoned in such\r\ncamps. All refugees and displaced persons must be\r\nassured the right to return to their homes voluntarily in\r\nsafety and dignity.\r\nFinally, Bangladesh welcomes the establishment of\r\nthe International Tribunal for the prosecution of war\r\ncrimes committed in the territories of former Yugoslavia.\r\nWe also fully support the call on the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, in the wake of the Order of the International\r\nCourt of Justice, to take all measures within its power to\r\nprevent the commission of the crime of genocide.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nThe international community’s prime objective is to\r\nassist the parties to reach a negotiated settlement acceptable\r\nto all sides. In view of the long history of duplicity and\r\nback-tracking by the Bosnian Serbs and by the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, we believe that pressure must be\r\nmaintained and intensified. Failure to move forward must\r\nbe accompanied by steps to reinforce sanctions, to enhance\r\nand expand exclusion zones and to lift the arms embargo.\r\nBangladesh fully supports draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.14/Rev.l and is happy to be a sponsor.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in the\r\ndebate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.14/Rev.1.\r\nI should like to announce that the following countries\r\nhave become sponsors of the draft resolution: Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Mali and Yemen.\r\nSeveral representatives wish to make statements in\r\nexplanation of vote before the vote. May I remind\r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10\r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Sidorov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): The delegation of the Russian Federation cannot\r\nsupport draft resolution A/49/L.14/Rev.1 on the situation in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, owing to the document’s one-\r\nsided and unbalanced character and its failure sufficiently\r\nto reflect the complexity of the situation.\r\nOur debate on the draft resolution has been held\r\nagainst the background of a renewal of the dangerous\r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and intensified large-\r\nscale violence on the part of the Government forces. It\r\nshould be noted that the crimes perpetrated by those forces\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina in the area of Bihac is an open\r\nchallenge to the decisions of the Security Council in\r\nresolution 913 (1994), which, in paragraph 4, called for\r\n“an end to any provocative action by whomsoever\r\ncommitted in and around the safe areas”.\r\nWe cannot but express concern at the mass exodus of\r\nthe civilian population in the region, nor can we ignore the\r\nworsening situation in and around Sarajevo as a result of\r\nthe constant violations of the demilitarized-zone regime by\r\nthe Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is\r\nevery reason to fear that if this dangerous trend is not\r\nstopped, there will inevitably be a flare-up of large-scale\r\ncivil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina that will destroy all\r\nhope for a peaceful settlement.\r\nBecause there is such a threat, the draft resolution\r\nshould contain a demand that all the parties in Bosnia\r\ncease any military activity; it is precisely the lack of this\r\nprovision — which was included in last year’s\r\nresolution — that prompts reflection.\r\nInstead of including such a provision, the whole\r\nblame for the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is put,\r\nas usual, on the Bosnian Serbs. Of course, we are not\r\nminimizing the responsibility of the Bosnian Serb party\r\nfor the dangerous developments of events in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, as well as their refusal to adopt the map of\r\nterritorial settlement contained in the Contact Group’s\r\nproposal. But neither can we close our eyes to the fact\r\nthat there are good reasons to bring serious complaints\r\nagainst the other Bosnian parties not only for the\r\nprovocative and aggressive actions I have already\r\nmentioned but also for the flagrant violations of human\r\nrights and harassment of minorities which are very\r\nreminiscent of the practice of “ethnic cleansing”\r\ncondemned by the international community.\r\nThe fact that the draft resolution ignores the new\r\nrealities of the situation in the Yugoslav settlement\r\nprocess, which have gained international recognition —\r\nfirst and foremost in the Security Council’s decisions —\r\nis startling. We are thinking, of course, of the closing by\r\nBelgrade of the frontier with Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nIncidentally, in the context of an effective and\r\ncontrollable implementation of this draft resolution, we\r\ncannot but be surprised at the contents of paragraph 15 of\r\nthe draft resolution, concerning the so-called activities\r\ntaking place “to achieve integration of the occupied\r\nterritories” into the administrative and other systems of\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\r\nA number of the provisions in the draft resolution in\r\ngeneral have nothing to do with the subject of this\r\nparticular agenda item. For example, paragraph 12 raises\r\nquestions that come under the internal jurisdiction of\r\nanother State and are unsuitable for consideration at the\r\nUnited Nations. Something else that is puzzling is the\r\nwording used to describe the situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina as “aggression” and the areas under Bosnian-\r\nSerb control as “occupied territories”.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nAs to the requests to raise the embargo on arms\r\nsupplies to Bosnia and Herzegovina, I would like to\r\nemphasize that Russia, in complete accordance with the\r\nGeneva Communiqué from the Ministers of Foreign Affairs\r\nin the Contact Group, 30 July 1994, sees this step as\r\nextremely undesirable. Its implementation at this point\r\nwould have extremely negative consequences for a political\r\nsettlement, for the United Nations peace-keeping operations\r\nand for a continuation of the provision of humanitarian aid\r\nto the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nIn accordance with what I have said, the Russian\r\ndelegation will refrain from voting on the draft resolution\r\nas a whole; if several paragraphs in the draft, particularly\r\nparagraphs 12, 15, 22 and 23, were to be put to a separate\r\nvote, our delegation would vote against them all.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to recall that, from the\r\nbeginning of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, Russia has\r\nplayed an active role in the international community’s\r\nefforts to promote a political settlement to the Bosnian\r\nconflict. Our premise continues to be that the United\r\nNations steps must be directed towards supporting the\r\npeaceful efforts of the Contact Group to bring the parties to\r\naccept the Group’s proposals. We continue to be convinced\r\nthat these proposals, together with the relevant resolutions\r\nof the Security Council, are a realistic basis for a stable,\r\npeaceful settlement based on the principles of justice,\r\nimpartiality and equal rights for all parties.\r\nMr. Mongbe (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nBenin and its delegation unreservedly condemn any act of\r\nbarbarity and any violation of human rights anywhere in the\r\nworld; such acts and violations have been visited upon the\r\nBosnian people every day for the last three years. “Ethnic\r\ncleansing” is an odious practice that cannot be tolerated by\r\nany responsible Government. Benin is for an immediate and\r\nlasting peace but not a peace built on cemeteries.\r\nThat is why we welcome the peace plan produced by\r\nthe Contact Group and supported by all of the international\r\ncommunity. My delegation welcomes the noble and\r\ncourageous decision of the Government of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to accept this plan, which is a serious basis for\r\nrestoring peace and security not only in this martyred\r\ncountry but also in the Balkan region as a whole. My\r\ndelegation finds it difficult to understand the rejection of\r\nthe peace plan by the Bosnian Serbs and condemns this\r\nattitude, which is, to say the least, dangerous. How will the\r\nBosnian Serbs be able to carry out political negotiations\r\nwith the other interested parties, if they maintain such\r\nirascible obstinacy? Benin is relieved to hear of the decision\r\nby the Belgrade authorities to accept the peace plan and\r\nto close the frontiers of their country with a view to\r\nrespecting the arms embargo decided upon by the\r\nSecurity Council in its resolution 713 (1991).\r\nThe task of the United Nations under the Charter is\r\nto promote peace, not to bring together all the ingredients\r\nto encourage war. This is why, while we subscribe in\r\ngeneral to the provisions in draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.14/Rev.1, our delegation cannot support the idea\r\ncontained in paragraph 22, encouraging\r\n“the Security Council to give all due consideration\r\nand exempt the Governments of the Republic and\r\nFederation of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the\r\nembargo on deliveries of weapons and military\r\nequipment”.\r\nMy delegation urges the sponsors to measure all the\r\nconsequences of this paragraph. Its implementation would\r\nlead to an increase in the perilous flow of arms and\r\nwould make of the Balkans, alas, an infernal powder-keg\r\nonce again. And what about the fate of the personnel of\r\nthe United Nations Protection Force in the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina if weapons were to enter as\r\nfreely as the paragraph I have just referred to implies?\r\nThe situation remains explosive in that country.\r\nNothing has really changed since the Security Council’s\r\nadoption of resolution 713 (1991). The peoples of these\r\nnew States are suffering and will go on suffering even\r\nmore if our Assembly, which has not yet regained its full\r\ncredibility, goes ahead and raises the arms embargo as\r\nspecified in the draft resolution. Let us not be blinded.\r\nLet us not get carried away by any considerations other\r\nthan those that are likely to help free the populations of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina from the torments of war, from\r\nhorror, and from crimes of every sort.\r\nBenin reiterates its position, already expressed in this\r\nHall by its Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation\r\non 30 September last, that, faced with the intransigence of\r\nthe Bosnian Serbs, the international community must\r\nensure the protection and defence of the sovereignty and\r\nthe territorial integrity of Bosnia. That certainly will not\r\nbe accomplished by escalating hostilities or authorizing\r\nrearmament.\r\nBenin states again its support for the establishment\r\nof an international tribunal to bring to trial those who\r\nhave committed crimes related to the practice of “ethnic\r\ncleansing” and other massive human-rights violations.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nIn a word, my country is in favour of a peaceful\r\nsolution to this conflict, which has gone on for too long. It\r\nshould therefore be easy to understand that the delegation\r\nof Benin cannot but abstain in the voting on draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.14/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Karsgaard (Canada): Canada’s deep concern for\r\nthe plight of the Bosnian people and our commitment to a\r\npeaceful solution to the conflict are well known. While we\r\nsupport most of the views expressed in the draft resolution,\r\nCanada is not in a position to vote for a draft resolution\r\nthat calls for a lifting of the arms embargo on the\r\nGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We, like Bosnia,\r\ndesire a speedy resolution to the conflict, but we must point\r\nout that the best hope for a durable and peaceful end to the\r\nconflict remains the Contact Group’s peace plan. The status\r\nquo is not an acceptable solution.\r\nWe are encouraged by recent positive steps, including\r\nthe decision by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia\r\nand Montenegro) to close its border with the Bosnian Serbs\r\nand to allow monitoring of this decision. We must allow\r\nmore time for sanctions and other non-violent measures to\r\nconvince the Bosnian Serbs that accepting the Contact\r\nGroup plan is in their best interest.\r\nThe Security Council decided to impose an arms\r\nembargo on all of the former Yugoslavia in 1991 because\r\nit believed that reducing the arms supply would help lower\r\nthe level of hostilities and enable avenues for a peaceful\r\nsettlement to be pursued. This analysis remains as valid\r\ntoday as it was then. Allowing more and heavier weapons\r\nto come into Bosnia would lead to a greater loss of life. It\r\nwould make it impossible for the United Nations Protection\r\nForce (UNPROFOR) to deliver humanitarian assistance to\r\nthe desperate people in Bosnia and would force countries\r\nsuch as Canada to withdraw their troops.\r\nCanada remains firmly committed to helping the\r\npeople of Bosnia come to a peaceful solution to the\r\nconflict, but we cannot endorse any draft resolution that\r\nwould lead to an increase in fighting and loss of life. For\r\nthese reasons, Canada cannot support the draft resolution\r\nand will abstain in the voting.\r\nMr. Laptsenok (Belarus) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): The Republic of Belarus is extremely concerned\r\nat the recent complications in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nHowever, we start from the premise that military measures\r\nwill not help stabilize the situation in the Balkans and could\r\nhave unforeseeable consequences.\r\nIn this connection, we cannot support the proposal to\r\nlift the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, since\r\nsuch a step would lead to a further escalation of\r\nhostilities, threaten the whole negotiating process and give\r\nrise to conditions that could spread the conflict beyond\r\nthe frontiers of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We would like,\r\nif possible, to achieve a political settlement of the\r\nconflict.\r\nBearing all that in mind, my delegation will abstain\r\nin the voting.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now begin the\r\nvoting process.\r\nI put to the vote draft resolution A/49/L.14/Rev.1.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua\r\nand Barbuda, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain,\r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam,\r\nBurkina Faso, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia,\r\nComoros, Costa Rica, Croatia, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt,\r\nEl Salvador, Eritrea, Fiji, Gabon, Guatemala, Guyana,\r\nHaiti, Honduras, Hungary, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic\r\nRepublic of), Iraq, Israel, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan,\r\nKuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya, Lithuania, Madagascar, Malaysia,\r\nMaldives, Mali, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mauritius,\r\nMicronesia (Federated States of), Mongolia, Morocco,\r\nMozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Oman,\r\nPakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru,\r\nPhilippines, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of\r\nMoldova, Rwanda, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Senegal,\r\nSingapore, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Sudan,\r\nSuriname, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, The Former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nTunisia, Turkey, Uganda, United Arab Emirates,\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, United States of America,\r\nUruguay, Vanuatu, Yemen\r\nAgainst: None\r\nAbstaining: Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Armenia,\r\nAustralia, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Brazil,\r\nBulgaria, Burundi, Cameroon, Canada, China,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,\r\nEstonia, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany,\r\nGreece, Grenada, Iceland, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan,\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nKenya, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malta, Mexico,\r\nMonaco, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria,\r\nNorway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation,\r\nSan Marino, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland,\r\nSweden, Togo, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Zambia,\r\nZimbabwe\r\nDraft resolution A/49/L.14/Rev.1 was adopted by 97\r\nvotes to none, with 61 abstentions (resolution 49/10).\r\nThe President: We shall now hear those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to explain their vote on the draft\r\nresolution just adopted.\r\nMay I remind delegations that statements in\r\nexplanation of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Albin (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has caused great\r\nconcern in the international community. The General\r\nAssembly has tackled the question on three occasions, but\r\nunfortunately no solution to this difficult and complex\r\nconflict has been found. We regret that the sad fate of this\r\nMember State of the United Nations has not been relieved.\r\nIndeed, there have been new outbreaks of armed violence.\r\nFor the Government of Mexico, the persistence of\r\nhuman-rights violations, “ethnic-cleansing” policies and acts\r\nof aggression designed to acquire territory by the use of\r\nforce undermine the very basis of civilized relations\r\nbetween nations and cause a worsening in relations between\r\npeoples. Mexico also would reject any action that would\r\nlimit the political independence, territorial integrity, self-\r\ndetermination, indeed the very sovereignty, of the Republic\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe join in strongly appealing to all the parties directly\r\nor indirectly related to the situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to seek a solution to the conflict in good faith.\r\nThe aggression and violence, which have made the\r\nliving conditions of millions of human beings intolerable,\r\nmust come to an end. Political dialogue and understanding,\r\nthe best way to achieve peace, must prevail over the horrors\r\nof war. We therefore support all political and diplomatic\r\nefforts to achieve a definitive solution to the problems of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe resolution the General Assembly has adopted\r\ntoday has numerous elements that we support and fully\r\nendorse. My delegation abstained in the voting, however,\r\nbecause we believe that the text also contains provisions\r\nthat are at variance with the letter and spirit of the United\r\nNations Charter. Mexico’s abstention on this resolution is\r\na statement in favour of a solution based not on\r\nconsiderations of expedience, but on the principles of the\r\nCharter thus guaranteeing a secure, permanent peace in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nMr. Francis (Australia): Australia is appalled that\r\nfighting continues in Bosnia and Herzegovina, adding\r\nfurther to the suffering of innocent civilian populations\r\nthere. We support the calls contained in this resolution for\r\nan end to this violence and to the violations of human\r\nrights, including the practice of “ethnic cleansing”,\r\nwhoever the perpetrator might be, and for the restoration\r\nof peace and stability to the country and to the region as\r\na whole.\r\nFor these reasons, we should have liked to vote in\r\nfavour of the resolution, as we did at the forty-seventh\r\nand forty-eighth sessions of the General Assembly.\r\nHowever, Australia has reservations about the wisdom at\r\nthis time of lifting the arms embargo as it affects the\r\nGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the\r\nFederation. The Contact Group has acknowledged that\r\nsuch a lifting may be unavoidable, but as a last resort. We\r\ndo not believe that that time is yet upon us. Other\r\navenues to end the conflict are still being explored by the\r\nContact Group. In addition, new pressure now being\r\napplied on the Bosnian Serbs, which we hope will be\r\nmaintained, should be given time to have its effect.\r\nWe recognize, as do many others here today, that a\r\ndecision to lift the arms embargo would very likely bring\r\nto an end the current initiatives aimed at facilitating a\r\npeaceful settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. Lifting the arms embargo would, in\r\nparticular, have very serious implications for an\r\nintensification of hostilities, for the continued presence of\r\nthe United Nations Protection Force and for the\r\nhumanitarian relief effort in the country.\r\nWe strongly support the actions taken today by the\r\ninternational community and the Security Council to bring\r\nto an end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\r\nstrongly urge that those efforts be continued. Above all,\r\nAustralia wishes to see a peaceful, negotiated solution to\r\nthis tragic conflict. For these reasons, we were compelled\r\nto abstain in the voting on this resolution.\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nMr. Cárdenas (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I should like to explain the position of the\r\nArgentine Republic in the voting on the resolution,\r\ncontained in document A/49/L.14/Rev.1, which the General\r\nAssembly has just adopted.\r\nMy country generally supports all the initiatives of our\r\nOrganization aimed at reaffirming the sovereignty,\r\nindependence and territorial integrity of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, which we are determined to see\r\nrespected.\r\nThe current diplomatic position, undermined by the\r\nBosnian Serbs’ regrettable rejection of the Contact Group’s\r\npeace plan, has made it necessary for the international\r\ncommunity to reaffirm its determination to contribute to a\r\npeaceful settlement to the conflict.\r\nToday we are faced with a situation in which one\r\nside — that of the Bosnian Serbs — is continuing to\r\npromote an ethnic, fratricidal war rather than devote itself\r\nto achieving a settlement with the international guarantees\r\nwhich our Organization could offer. We therefore urge that\r\nside once again to reconsider the matter and work with the\r\ninternational community to put an end to aggression. The\r\ngrave violations of human rights and international\r\nhumanitarian law in Bosnia and Herzegovina have\r\ndisturbed, and continue to disturb, international public\r\nopinion. To deal with them, the International Tribunal on\r\nthe matter will soon become a cornerstone of the effort to\r\nrestore justice. In the present delicate security situation, we\r\nwould once again appeal for respect for the cease-fire and\r\nthe safe areas.\r\nNot all the indications are negative, however. I refer\r\nin particular to the measures recently adopted in connection\r\nwith the partial closing of the border between the Republic\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). We believe that these\r\nmeasures, if pursued, will contribute to the gradual\r\nachievement of peace in the region.\r\nThe Argentine Republic supports the basic principles\r\ncontained in the resolution just adopted on the situation in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and considers them to be fair.\r\nNevertheless, we regret that we were unable to support the\r\nresolution, in part because of the specific recommendation\r\nin operative paragraph 22. After a thorough consideration\r\nand assessment of the various options proposed for\r\nachieving the desired objectives, we believe the measure\r\nwould not contribute to a settlement of the conflict. We\r\nbelieve that the partial lifting of the arms embargo imposed\r\nby Security Council resolution 713 (1991) on the whole\r\nof the former Yugoslavia would not help to achieve peace\r\nand security in the region.\r\nWe also believe that this measure would to a certain\r\nextent imply an assessment that diplomatic efforts had\r\nproved to be in vain. Moreover, the risks of an escalation\r\nof the conflict cast a shadow not only over the future of\r\nthe long-suffering population of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nbut also over the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) as it strives to fulfil its mandate.\r\nI would point out here that, as in all other peace-\r\nkeeping operations, the principle of neutrality is one of\r\nthe fundamental guidelines for troop-contributing\r\ncountries. On that understanding, States that provide\r\ntroops to UNPROFOR have done so, and will continue to\r\ndo so, with the clear intention of contributing to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security in the region,\r\ngenerously and with no desire to take sides in the conflict.\r\nThe mandate and composition of UNPROFOR are,\r\nmoreover, the result of a very delicate balance, which\r\ncircumstances suggest should be maintained. It is a\r\nquestion of recognizing and duly assessing the positive\r\neffects of the peace-keeping effort there, which cannot be\r\nminimized.\r\nWe basically agree with the Secretary-General’s\r\njudgement, contained in document S/1994/1067 — a\r\nreport produced in the context of the most recent renewal\r\nof UNPROFOR’S mandate — that a measure such as that\r\nrecommended in paragraph 22 of the resolution would\r\nchange — in our opinion substantially — the nature of\r\nthe United Nations presence in the area and imply\r\nunacceptable risks to the Force.\r\nMr. Chirila (Romania) (interpretation from French):\r\nMy delegation abstained in the voting on draft resolution\r\nA/49/L.14/Rev.1, because of similar and even identical\r\nconcerns to those already mentioned, particularly by the\r\nrepresentative of Germany, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nI am referring in particular to paragraph 22 on lifting\r\nthe embargo on deliveries of weapons. Romania is a\r\nneighbour of the former Yugoslavia, and has always, in\r\nits capacity as member of the Security Council until 1992,\r\nand elsewhere, advocated a political settlement to the\r\nconflict in the former Yugoslavia in general and Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina in particular. The economic sacrifices\r\nmy country faithfully agreed to make, under the sanctions\r\nimposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\n(Serbia and Montenegro), are well known. We are doing\r\nour very best to use our good relations with all the States\r\nof the former Yugoslavia to encourage and establish a\r\nlasting political settlement on the basis of the participation\r\nof all parties involved and the parallel contribution of all\r\nthose who have committed themselves to facilitating the\r\nprocess.\r\nThis is a particularly critical time. In our view, there\r\nare two alternatives: either a speedy end to the stalemate in\r\nthe search for a political settlement or playing for time and\r\naccept responsibility for any potential rise in tension and\r\nconfrontation. The extension of the mandate of the United\r\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) until 31 March\r\n1995 should not be seen as a breathing space. Every effort\r\nmust be made by the parties directly concerned, and by\r\nthose who are called upon to contribute to the search for a\r\npeaceful settlement, to define and implement an overall\r\napproach acceptable to all sides in order to ensure that the\r\nBosnian Serbs agree to the territorial settlement proposed\r\nby the Contact Group and to bring the three parties to the\r\nnegotiating table.\r\nIn this context, the parallel process initiated by\r\nSecurity Council resolution 943 (1994) for the gradual\r\nlifting of the economic sanctions on the Federal Republic\r\nof Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should be\r\ncontinued, while keeping the latter’s conduct very much in\r\nmind.\r\nMore than ever before, the elements that can bring the\r\nparties closer together should be emphasized; this should\r\nencourage those who are showing the true political will to\r\nensure that peace and a political settlement among the\r\nparties in Bosnia and Herzegovina will prevail.\r\nMr. Keating (New Zealand): Since the Assembly last\r\naddressed the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a\r\nnumber of important developments have taken place. The\r\nBosniac and Croat communities in the Republic have\r\nresolved their political differences and have formed a\r\nFederation. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) air power, authorized by the United Nations, has\r\nstopped the worst of the bombardment of Sarajevo and\r\nattacks on the other safe areas. The member nations of the\r\nContact Group have devised a peace plan for Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina which has been accepted by all parties except\r\nthe Bosnian Serbs. The authorities of the Federal Republic\r\nof Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) have closed their\r\nborder with Bosnia so as to isolate the recalcitrant Bosnian\r\nSerbs, and as a result, some of the measures imposed on\r\nBelgrade have been suspended. The Yugoslavia war\r\ncrimes Tribunal is now established.\r\nThese changes have come about because of the\r\ndetermination and commitment of the international\r\ncommunity. They constitute a significant improvement in\r\nboth the material and the political situation of the\r\nbeleaguered citizens of Bosnia. But they fall far short of\r\nwhat we would have hoped to see 12 months ago. The\r\nresolution on which we have just taken action, in its\r\nreiteration of provisions from last year, reminds us just\r\nhow much still has to be achieved: firstly, the restoration\r\nand reconstruction of Sarajevo; secondly, the opening of\r\nTuzla airport; thirdly, full implementation of the safe\r\nareas; fourthly, redress of the consequences of “ethnic\r\ncleansing”; and, fifthly, the return of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons.\r\nMore fundamentally, the resolution records and\r\nrightly condemns the refusal of the Bosnian Serbs to\r\nnegotiate within a framework which takes as its starting-\r\npoint the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nIt is at this level that we are no further ahead this year\r\nthan last. By clinging to outmoded and repugnant\r\nconcepts of ethnic purity, the Bosnian Serbs are\r\ncondemning themselves to a state of banishment. There is\r\nindeed a depressing familiarity about their continued\r\nrefusal to acknowledge that their political future cannot be\r\ndetermined in isolation from that of the other\r\ncommunities in Bosnia. The Bosniacs and the Croats have\r\nacknowledged this through the establishment of a\r\nFederation and their endorsement of the peace plan put on\r\nthe table by the Contact Group. The Bosnian Serbs must\r\ndo likewise.\r\nThe means to ensure that the Bosnian Serbs do turn\r\nround is the nub of the challenge the United Nations\r\nfaces. The international community now has a range of\r\nmeasures at its disposal, diplomatic, economic and\r\nmilitary. These measures have two characteristics in\r\ncommon: first, they are collective, and second, they are\r\nsanctioned by the United Nations. That means that they\r\ncarry the full weight of the international community.\r\nThis cannot be said of the provision in the resolution\r\nthat encourages the Security Council to exempt the\r\nGovernments of the Republic and Federation of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina from the arms embargo imposed on the\r\nformer Yugoslavia in 1991. For the Council to take such\r\na step would be to move away from collective action.\r\nThere may come a time when there is no alternative to\r\nsuch a step. When that time comes, it would mean that\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\nthe United Nations as such, in terms of the collective\r\nsecurity provisions of the Charter, no longer had a role.\r\nNew Zealand does not believe that that time has come,\r\nnor will it be welcome if it does, because it will mean an\r\nabandonment of peacemaking and a recourse to the verdict\r\nof war. Now is the time to redouble efforts in the search\r\nfor a political settlement, not to signal a return to general\r\nwarfare. For this reason, New Zealand abstained in the vote\r\non the draft resolution.\r\nMr. Ponce (Ecuador) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe solidarity of the people and the Government of\r\nEcuador with the long-suffering people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the need to preserve the territorial\r\nintegrity of States has prompted my delegation today to\r\nvote in favour of the resolution that has just been adopted.\r\nHowever, we would like to point out that the\r\ncomplicated peace process has in the past few months made\r\nconsiderable progress, which the international community\r\nmust acknowledge. This progress has been made possible\r\nthanks to the flexibility of all the Governments that are\r\nparties to the conflict. Hence, Ecuador has doubts about the\r\ndesirability of adopting decisions, such as the lifting of the\r\narms embargo, which might reignite the conflict and make\r\na final settlement even more remote.\r\nWith this conviction, had paragraph 22 been put to a\r\nseparate vote my delegation would have abstained.\r\nThe President: One representative has requested to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind\r\nmembers that statements in exercise of the right of reply\r\nare limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina): After the\r\nlengthy day all of us have had, and with my sincere thanks\r\nto all my colleagues, I shall certainly refrain from\r\nexceeding the imposed time-limit.\r\nThe statement made in this debate on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, while once again repeating the Union’s\r\nopposition to the lifting of the arms embargo, endorses a\r\nnew set of guidelines as an alternative not only to the\r\nlifting of the arms embargo but also, effectively, to the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, the principles of the London\r\nConference and even the Contact Group peace plan. The\r\nEuropean Union proposes, in particular\r\n“balanced treatment for the Bosniac Croat and\r\nBosnian Serb entities, including the establishment of\r\nparallel special relationships with neighbouring\r\ncountries, provided that this would not be\r\ninconsistent with the integrity of the Union of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina”. (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 50th meeting, p. 18)\r\nI regret to say that, whether by oversight or\r\notherwise, that proposal is morally and legally flawed,\r\nand disregards the relevant principles — and, in fact, the\r\nUnited Nations Charter — for the following reasons:\r\nFirst, how can we speak of a “parallel special\r\nrelationship” that is designed to promote the same\r\nconsequences for the aggressor and the victim?\r\nSecondly, the proposal is especially troubling in\r\nview of the fact that the war — the aggression — was\r\nstarted by the Serbian-Montenegrans in conjunction with\r\nthe so-called Bosnian Serbs in order, in fact, to achieve\r\nthe very goal of an ethnically homogeneous “greater\r\nSerbia” at the expense of its neighbours. This aspect of\r\nthe European Union plan proposes now, in effect, the\r\ncreation of this “greater Serbia” as part of the settlement\r\nof this war.\r\nThirdly, there is not and cannot be any parallel\r\nbetween the Bosniac and Croat Federation on the one\r\nhand and the so-called Bosnian Serb entity on the other.\r\nThe Bosniac and Croat Federation and the proposed\r\ncloser relationship between the Republic and Federation\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia\r\nis born out of a desire to reintensify the support for\r\nmulticulturalism and coexistence in the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina for all, including Croats, Serbs,\r\nJews, Muslims and others, while a “greater Serbia”, to the\r\ncontrary, promotes ethnic “purity” at the expense of\r\nmulticulturalism. Unfortunately, this aspect of the\r\nEuropean Union proposal, unintentionally or not, can only\r\ngive new hope and vigour to those who seek the creation\r\nof unprecedented and ethnically “pure” States.\r\nFinally, and most unfortunately, this aspect of the\r\nEuropean Union statement reflects a lack of consciousness\r\nwith respect to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina are not mentioned, while the statement says\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 3 November 1994\r\n“provided that this would not be inconsistent with the\r\nintegrity of the Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina”.\r\n(ibid.)\r\nThere is no Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Union\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina may be a concept promoted by\r\nsome — maybe even by some members of the European\r\nUnion — as a weaker substitute for the Republic, designed\r\nto induce the Serbians to accept the peace plan. However,\r\nthe Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot now become\r\na substitute for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina or\r\na mechanism to substitute for, and effectively undermine,\r\nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and legitimacy of the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Any proposed\r\nsettlement must respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity\r\nand legitimacy of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nfirst, and cannot circumvent these principles by\r\nemphasizing a proposed union. Maybe some members of\r\nthe European Union had a different reading in mind when\r\nthis statement was drafted, but we cannot afford to be\r\neither casual or lacking in vigilance.\r\nUnfortunately, the statement also reflected the\r\nerosion of the Contact Group peace plan from some\r\nsectors within, owing to a lack of commitment and will\r\nto confront those who oppose the Contact Group peace\r\nplan from without — that is, the Bosnian Serbs. I am\r\nafraid that this also reflects once again a growing\r\ntendency towards expediency. It is also more evidence of\r\nwhy the choice for all of us here was not purely the issue\r\nof lifting the arms embargo: it was a choice between the\r\nmarginalization and even abandonment of international\r\nlaw and the United Nations Charter in favour of\r\nexpediency, versus demanding options to soundly support\r\nour common principles.\r\nNo one can afford to be neutral, to abstain, on this\r\ncommunal route of legality. The future of the United\r\nNations as a whole cannot lie in selective application of\r\nlegality. It must be based on the united and objective\r\ncommitment to shared principles, in particular to the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nIn response to the comments of the representative of\r\nthe Russian Federation, we would like once again to\r\nemphasize unequivocally our acceptance of the Contact\r\nGroup peace plan and our commitment to exercising our\r\nright to self-defence. However, we cannot be expected to\r\nabandon our right to self-defence and to acquiesce in the\r\ncontinuing rejection of the peace plan by the so-called\r\nBosnian Serbs. Simply, when the Serbians are ready to\r\naccept and implement the Contact Group peace plan, give\r\nup occupation of most of our country and stop the “ethnic\r\ncleansing” and sieges of our cities, then we will also be\r\nprepared to restrain our right to acquire defensive\r\nweapons.\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded\r\nthe present stage of its consideration of agenda item 39.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.\r\n37\r\n"
