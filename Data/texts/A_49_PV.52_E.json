(Côte D’Ivoire)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Píriz Ballón\r\n(Uruguay), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nFloods in Egypt\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I wish\r\nto express, on behalf of all the members of the General\r\nAssembly, our deepest sympathy and condolences to the\r\nGovernment and people of Egypt at the loss of life and\r\nextensive material damage that have resulted from the\r\nfloods which have recently occurred in that country.\r\nMay I also express the hope that the international\r\ncommunity will respond promptly and generously to\r\nrequests for aid to deal with the effects of this disaster.\r\nI now call on the Permanent Representative of Egypt\r\nto the United Nations.\r\nMr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThank you, Mr. President. The delegation of Egypt wishes\r\nto convey to you its sincerest thanks for the condolences\r\nthat you extended on the occasion of the disasters that\r\nafflicted my country since 3 November 1994. The\r\ndelegation of Egypt also wishes to express its appreciation\r\nfor the expressions of sympathy and the condolences\r\nextended by the members of the international community.\r\nEgypt has suffered sudden flooding from torrential\r\nrains following abrupt climatic changes. This has resulted\r\nin great loss of life and extensive material damage in the\r\nsouth of Egypt. The flooding caused damage to oil tanks,\r\nwhich caught fire and increased the number of victims. A\r\nstate of emergency was declared in the country to rescue\r\nthe victims and to provide assistance to the flooded areas\r\nin upper Egypt. The preliminary reports put the number\r\nof victims at more than 500 people. A plan has been\r\nprepared to set up special camps for those who have lost\r\ntheir homes through flooding or fire, and a health and\r\nmedical plan has been put in place. This included the\r\nprovision of means of transportation to hospitals and\r\nmedical centres.\r\nThe competent authorities are continuing to estimate\r\nthe number of victims and to assess the extent of material\r\ndamage in order to provide the necessary compensation to\r\nthe victims.\r\nThe Egyptian delegation would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express its appreciation to all the States,\r\ndelegations and international agencies that have provided\r\nemergency assistance. This clearly reflects their solidarity\r\nwith the people of Egypt and encourages us to continue\r\nto struggle to rebuild the flooded areas.\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nAgenda item 89 (continued)\r\nEnvironment and sustainable development\r\n(e) Global Conference on the Sustainable Development\r\nof Small Island Developing States\r\nReport of the Conference (A/CONF.167/9 and\r\nCorr.1 and Corr.2)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/49/425 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nNotes by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreports of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (A/49/414 and A/49/459)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMembers will recall that at its 30th plenary meeting, held\r\non 13 October 1994, the General Assembly decided to hold\r\nthe debate on sub-item (e) of item 89 directly in plenary\r\nmeeting, on the understanding that action on the sub-item\r\nwould be taken in the Second Committee.\r\nIn connection with this sub-item, the Assembly has\r\nbefore it the report of the Conference (A/CONF.167/9), the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on action taken to\r\nimplement the Programme of Action adopted by the\r\nConference (A/49/425 and Add.1), and two notes by the\r\nSecretary-General: one transmitting the feasibility study by\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on a\r\nsmall island developing States network (A/49/414), and the\r\nother transmitting the feasibility study, also by UNDP, on\r\na small island developing States technical assistance\r\nprogramme (A/49/459).\r\nI should like to propose that, if there is no objection,\r\nthe list of speakers in the debate on this sub-item be closed\r\ntoday at 11 a.m.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\ntherefore request those representatives wishing to participate\r\nin the debate to inscribe their names on the list of speakers\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (interpretation from French):\r\nIt is with great emotion, Mr. President, that I associate\r\nmyself and the Algerian delegation with the condolences\r\nyou expressed to the delegation of Egypt on the terrible,\r\ncruel losses that the brotherly Egyptian people have\r\nsuffered as a result of the flooding that occurred on\r\n3 November last. As soon as news of the catastrophe\r\nreached me, the Algerian Government took measures to\r\nsend emergency assistance to Egypt immediately to help\r\nalleviate the suffering of the victims. The delegations of\r\nthe countries that are members of the Group of 77 and the\r\ndelegation of China, on whose behalf I am speaking, pay\r\ntribute to the memory of the victims and express their\r\nheartfelt sympathy to the bereaved families and to the\r\npeople and Government of Egypt.\r\nSix months after the adoption of the Programme of\r\nAction by the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, which\r\nmet from 25 April to 6 May 1994 in Bridgetown on the\r\nbasis of proposals presented by the Group of 77, the\r\nGeneral Assembly today has before it results that\r\nrepresent the sum total of the efforts exerted during three\r\npreparatory meetings and the intensive and constructive\r\nnegotiations held in Barbados.\r\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States had its\r\norigins in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 and was convened in\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 47/189. It\r\nwas the first conference of its type in the area of\r\nsustainable development and therefore was an important\r\nstep in the follow-up to and implementation of the\r\ndecisions of the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED).\r\nThe specific commitment of the international\r\ncommunity to the development of small island States\r\nemerged from the awareness that these States represent a\r\nspecific case from the point of view both of the\r\nenvironment and development and of their specific\r\ncharacteristics, which include the fragility of their\r\necosystems, their small size, their limited resources, their\r\ngeographical dispersion and their distance from world\r\nmarkets. These are handicaps that, inter alia, limit these\r\nStates’ opportunities for the kind of economic and social\r\ndevelopment that would be in keeping with the particular\r\ncharacteristics of their natural and environmental\r\nsurroundings.\r\nThe Barbados Declaration and the Programme of\r\nAction adopted by the Conference, by formally ratifying\r\nthe international community’s recognition of the specific\r\nneeds of the small island developing States, constitute\r\nindispensable instruments that set forward the objectives\r\nto be fulfilled and the practical measures to be\r\nimplemented in order to achieve sustainable development\r\nin those countries. These two documents lay the\r\ngroundwork for the systematic follow-up to UNCED, and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nin particular of section G of chapter 17 of Agenda 21,\r\nwhich deals with the development of small island States.\r\nThe Barbados Programme of Action thus defines 14\r\npriority areas and recommends a logical set of measures\r\nto be taken and policies to be formulated in the short,\r\nmedium and long term by the small island States\r\nthemselves, with the consistent support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn this context, it is clear that the specific\r\ncommitment of the small island States to the\r\nimplementation of the objectives of the Programme of\r\nAction will be a decisive element in the implementation\r\nof and follow-up to the Barbados Conference.\r\nDuring the second summit meeting of the Alliance\r\nof Small Island States, held on 4 May 1994 concurrently\r\nwith the Bridgetown Conference, political leaders at the\r\nhighest level reaffirmed\r\n“their commitment to the decisions of the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment and their determination to pursue and\r\nto formulate policies to promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment”.\r\nThey also expressed\r\n“their firm commitment to taking the necessary\r\naction on the national, regional and international\r\nlevels to ensure the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action”.\r\nBut while it is clear that the specific implementation\r\nof the Programme of Action is the primary responsibility\r\nof the small island States, it goes without saying that the\r\nefforts of these countries cannot in and of themselves lead\r\nto the fulfilment of the tasks identified in the 14 priority\r\nareas. The support of the international community as a\r\nwhole, including the United Nations system, is critical to\r\nthis. The international community’s areas and means of\r\nintervention, as defined by the Conference’s Programme\r\nof Action, are contingent on the mobilization of adequate\r\nnew and additional resources, the transfer of and access\r\nto technologies adapted to specific local conditions, and\r\nthe establishment of appropriate institutional follow-up\r\nmachinery, particularly at the international level.\r\nIn that context, the delegations on whose behalf I\r\nhave the honour to speak are particularly interested in\r\nparagraph 123 of the Programme of Action, relating to\r\nthe follow-up to the Conference by the United Nations\r\nSecretariat and, more specifically, the establishment\r\nwithin the Department for Policy Coordination and\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nSustainable Development of a “clearly identifiable, qualified\r\nand competent entity” (A/49/425, para.139) that would be\r\nput in place to provide secretariat support for both\r\nintergovernmental and inter-agency coordination\r\nmechanisms.\r\nIn the same spirit, I am pleased to express our\r\nappreciation to the United Nations Development Programme\r\nfor the professionalism and speed with which it responded,\r\nin the agreed time limit, to the invitation extended to it\r\nunder paragraphs 105 and 106 of the Programme of Action\r\nto carry out two feasibility studies dealing, respectively,\r\nwith the establishment of an information network of small\r\nisland developing States and with a technical assistance\r\nprogramme designed to promote intra- and inter-regional\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe motto of the Barbados Conference was “Small\r\nStates, Large Questions”. It achieved significant results and\r\nthereby inspired great hopes. While the stakes of the States\r\ninvolved are high, their partners in action have to make\r\nonly relatively modest efforts. The international community\r\nas a whole must reaffirm the vitality and viability of the\r\ncommitments made in Rio and effectively implement\r\nAgenda 21.\r\nFor all those reasons, the delegations of the States\r\nmembers of the Group of 77 and the delegation of China\r\nstrongly recommend that the General Assembly endorse the\r\nBarbados Declaration and Programme of Action.\r\nMr. Henze (Germany): I have the honour of speaking\r\non behalf of the European Union and Austria.\r\nFirst of all, I should like to join the President in\r\nexpressing our condolences on the heavy loss of life which\r\nEgypt has suffered as a result of the flooding there. We are\r\nall fully aware that this disaster will be a serious setback\r\nfor the development efforts of the Egyptian Government.\r\nPushing ahead with the programme of global\r\npartnership for environment and development initiated at\r\nRio more than two years ago represents one of the major\r\nchallenges the international community will be facing in the\r\nfuture in order to secure and maintain global peace and\r\nstability. In the framework of this long-term process, which,\r\ninter alia, involves a totally new quality of cooperation\r\nbetween industrialized and developing countries, quite a lot\r\nhas already been achieved. In fact, in adopting the\r\nDeclaration of Barbados and the Programme of Action for\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates within the framework of the Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, which was successfully concluded in May of this\r\nyear, the international community has taken an important\r\nstep towards the implementation of the commitments of\r\nRio and the principles of Agenda 21.\r\nA coherent strategy providing a framework of action\r\nfor the different players involved at the national, regional\r\nand international levels has been agreed upon. It takes\r\ninto account the main development constraints of the\r\nsmall island developing States and addresses the key\r\nissues in 14 cross-sectoral and sectoral priority areas\r\nrelated to the countries’ future development. In the view\r\nof the European Union, there is a realistic hope that the\r\nProgramme of Action as agreed at the Barbados\r\nConference will assist the small island developing States\r\non the path of sustainable development by, inter alia,\r\nenhancing their international competitiveness and reducing\r\ntheir economic instability and ecological fragility.\r\nThis optimism is based primarily on the fact that the\r\nProgramme that has been agreed upon is based on a\r\nconceptually sound approach that takes account of the\r\nprinciples of self-reliance and subsidiarity and recognizes\r\nboth the importance of capacity-building and regional\r\ncooperation and the role of the private sector and\r\nnon-governmental organizations in the implementation of\r\nthe Programme.\r\nCautious optimism also seems to be justified in\r\nregard to the implementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nAlthough at the present stage a definitive evaluation is not\r\npossible, owing to the short time that has elapsed since\r\nthe Barbados Conference, the Secretary-General’s report\r\non action taken to implement the Programme of Action\r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States clearly indicates that the United\r\nNations organizations and agencies are in the process of\r\nreorienting their development plans and programmes and\r\nof setting up adequate institutional arrangements in order\r\nto implement the strategy.\r\nIn this context, I should also like to mention the\r\ninitiative of the Alliance of Small Island States aimed at\r\nreducing greenhouse emissions until the year 2005 to the\r\nlevel of 1990 — an initiative which will be considered\r\nwithin the Framework Convention on Climate Change.\r\nThe European Union has given particular attention\r\nto the development needs and efforts of the small island\r\ndeveloping States and strongly supported the negotiation\r\nprocess leading to the Barbados Conference. Substantial\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nfinancial and technical support is being provided both\r\nwithin the framework of the European Union and by its\r\nmember States. The European Union’s multilateral\r\nassistance is managed by the European Commission and\r\nchannelled mainly through the Lomé Convention, which\r\nstates in its articles 335 to 337 that the African, Caribbean\r\nand Pacific island developing States are in special need of\r\ncooperation. Lomé IV allocates an amount of nearly 620\r\nmillion ECUs to this group of States in the 1990 to 1995\r\nperiod — the equivalent of approximately $775 million.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to express once\r\nagain the European Union’s and its member States’ firm\r\ncommitment to the effective implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States agreed in Barbados.\r\nBased on this framework, in the years to come our\r\nactions will — even more than in the past — take into\r\naccount the small island developing States’ specific\r\ndevelopment constraints; our assistance will be\r\nenvironmentally as well as poverty oriented with a special\r\nfocus on the group of the least developed countries. Special\r\nemphasis will also be placed on strengthening regional\r\ncooperation and integration with the aim of improving the\r\nsmall island developing States’ external sector performance,\r\nreducing development constraints in the transport and\r\ncommunications sectors and enhancing common actions to\r\nprotect the countries from disasters and global hazards.\r\nIn fact, a reliable and lasting commitment on the part\r\nof all the parties involved is an indispensable prerequisite\r\nfor maintaining the dynamics of the process upon which the\r\ninternational community has embarked.\r\nMoreover, the success of the Barbados Conference\r\nwill in the long run largely depend on the extent to which\r\nthe impact and the benefit of the available resources can be\r\nmaximized by improved regional cooperation and donor\r\ncoordination; we believe that there is considerable room for\r\nthis.\r\nFinally, with regard to the effective implementation of\r\nthe Programme of Action we are confident that the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development will play a\r\npositive role in monitoring and reviewing the steps taken\r\nand the progress achieved in implementing the Programme\r\nof Action on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States.\r\nMr. Cheltenham (Barbados): The delegations of\r\nCARICOM wish to join the Chairman of the Group of 77\r\nin expressing sympathy to the people of Egypt following\r\nthe tragic losses suffered in the recent disaster.\r\nI have the honour to address this Assembly on\r\nbehalf of the 12 States Members of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) that are members of the United\r\nNations, namely: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas,\r\nBelize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, and my own country, Barbados, on\r\nagenda item 89 (e), entitled Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates.\r\nIn April this year, Barbados was privileged to host\r\nthe first ever United Nations Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates. The occasion brought to our shores high-level\r\ndelegations from some 116 countries and 150\r\nnon-governmental organizations, as well as representatives\r\nfrom the development sectors and operational agencies of\r\nthe United Nations system. The Conference was\r\nsignificant in two important ways. It was the first\r\ncomprehensive follow-up process to the Rio Summit to\r\nfulfil its mandate, and it marked the first time that a fully\r\nfledged United Nations Conference had been held in such\r\na small Member State.\r\nNeedless to say, the event represented an\r\nunprecedented financial and logistical challenge to the\r\nhost country. In this regard, Barbados is grateful to its\r\nCARICOM partners, and to the wider community of\r\nisland nations, for their assistance and solidarity, and to\r\nthe members of the international community for their\r\nencouragement and support. We wish also to pay special\r\ntribute to the dedicated team of United Nations and\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\npersonnel whose professional expertise and guidance\r\ncontributed significantly to a successful outcome.\r\nThe CARICOM Member States wish to associate\r\nthemselves fully with the remarks made earlier by the\r\ndelegation of Algeria, speaking on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77. The Rio process represented the international\r\ncommunity’s clear recognition of the urgent need to\r\nachieve a balanced and integrated approach to\r\nenvironment and development, in order to forge a global\r\npartnership for sustainable development. The process\r\nwhich began in Barbados represents the efforts of a\r\nspecific group of countries — small island developing\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nStates — with a commonality of characteristics, interests\r\nand vulnerabilities, to translate the Rio ethic into reality in\r\nresponse to their special circumstances. It demonstrates\r\ntheir solemn commitment to work together in a self-reliant\r\nand cooperative manner towards the goal of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, and their hopes for a supportive international\r\nenvironment to enable them to achieve that goal.\r\nThe two main outcomes of the Global Conference —\r\nthe Declaration of Barbados and the Programme of Action\r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States — have been brought before the General\r\nAssembly for its approval in document A/CONF.167/9. The\r\nStates Members of CARICOM urge the international\r\ncommunity to give them its full endorsement, and to set\r\nclear targets for the implementation of the important\r\nactivities detailed in the 14 substantive chapters of the\r\nProgramme of Action. That document provides us with a\r\nunique opportunity to create an effective model for system-\r\nwide United Nations coordination to achieve a concrete set\r\nof actions. For this to be possible, however, it is vital that\r\nthe United Nations Secretariat, through its Department for\r\nPolicy Coordination and Sustainable Development, be\r\nequipped to fulfil the monitoring and coordination mandate\r\nassigned to it in detail in paragraph 123 of the Programme\r\nof Action.\r\nThe provision of a well-staffed Secretariat support\r\nstructure dedicated to the follow-up of the outcomes of the\r\nConference is an indispensable component of the\r\nimplementation strategy. It is of crucial importance that this\r\npoint be carefully and comprehensively addressed by the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly. While we\r\nreiterate our disappointment at the inconclusive and\r\ninadequate proposals presented to the Conference on this\r\nsubject, we are heartened by the intention of the Secretariat,\r\nas indicated at paragraph 140 of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport, to reconsider its preliminary response in the light of\r\nthe concerns expressed in Barbados. We look forward to\r\nanalysing its new proposal in the near future. We\r\nconfidently expect that proposal to take into account the\r\ndemonstrated institutional requirements at Headquarters, and\r\nin the field through the sub-regional offices of the regional\r\nEconomic Commissions. It should also respond to\r\nparagraph 127, regarding the strengthening of the analytical\r\nand research capacity of the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD) to carry out its\r\npreliminary mandate in the context of the implementation\r\nof the Programme of Action.\r\nIn order for effective implementation of the outcomes\r\nof the Conference to be possible, the institutional structure\r\nenvisaged within the Secretariat must of necessity be\r\naccompanied by a complementary response capacity\r\nwithin the relevant operational organizations and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system. The\r\nCARICOM Member States welcome the information\r\nprovided by the Report of the Secretary General\r\n(A/49/425 and Add.1). In this regard we commend the\r\nprompt action taken by many of the development agencies\r\nto integrate the relevant elements of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action into their broader programmes, as\r\nwell as to begin the process of developing specific plans\r\nand programmes to implement several aspects of the\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nWe note also the positive response by several of the\r\nagencies to the proposal made in the Programme of\r\nAction for the establishment of focal points to coordinate\r\nthe implementation effort. We look forward to receiving\r\ndetails on the identity and location of the various focal\r\npoints and to developing a close working relationship\r\nwith them in pursuit of our common objective.\r\nIn the Caribbean, regional arrangements and\r\ninstitutions have long played an important role in our\r\ndevelopment effort. The emphasis given to regional\r\ninvolvement in the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction is therefore, in our view, well placed. We\r\nanticipate the active participation of the relevant United\r\nNations and intergovernmental regional and subregional\r\norganizations in this effort.\r\nThe Programme of Action assigns a central role to\r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development in the\r\nintergovernmental monitoring and follow-up of the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the Conference. For\r\nreasons of timing, the question could be treated only in an\r\nad hoc manner at this year’s session of the Commission\r\non Sustainable Development. We fully expect, however,\r\nthat by the third session adequate arrangements will be in\r\nplace for monitoring and reviewing, in a distinct and\r\nidentifiable manner, relevant progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.\r\nThe Commission will no doubt have a deep interest in\r\nreviewing the national, regional and international attempts\r\nto give practical application to the decisions of Rio in an\r\nislands context, where an accurate ongoing assessment of\r\nprogress is relatively simple to achieve.\r\nCARICOM Governments are well aware that an\r\neffective United Nations response to the Conference\r\nmandates can be achieved only through close inter-agency\r\ncollaboration. We are confident that the mechanism of the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nInter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development will\r\nbe fully exploited to ensure well coordinated\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action throughout the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nThe Assembly has before it for consideration two\r\nfurther reports (A/49/414 and A/49/459), both prepared by\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in\r\nresponse to a specific mandate from the Conference. We\r\nare greatly encouraged by the prompt and enthusiastic\r\nresponse of UNDP to the mandate entrusted to it, and look\r\nforward to working closely with UNDP and our partners in\r\nthe international community to translate the useful elements\r\nof the two feasibility studies into viable activities in support\r\nof the wider implementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nAs envisaged in that Programme, the Small Island\r\nDeveloping States Information Network (SIDS/NET) and\r\nthe Small Island Developing States Technical Assistance\r\nProgramme (SIDS/TAP) are complementary activities\r\nintended to encourage the exchange of experience and\r\npromote interregional and intraregional cooperation on\r\nsustainable development among small island developing\r\nStates. They should be viewed not as an end in themselves,\r\nbut rather as important facilitators which, if carefully\r\ndeveloped, could equip the islands with the capacity to\r\nrespond to the substantive priorities so clearly enumerated\r\nin the Programme of Action.\r\nThe States members of CARICOM participated at the\r\nexpert level in one of the two regional workshops held to\r\nconsult on the design and scope of SIDS/TAP. Our\r\nGovernments believe that the use of the modality of\r\ntechnical cooperation among developing countries is\r\nappropriate in this regard, and are supportive of the view\r\narticulated in the study that SIDS/TAP must be viewed as\r\na complement to, and not as a substitute for, existing\r\ntechnical-assistance programmes. We see the development\r\nof a comprehensive directory of capacities and expertise in\r\nthe sustainable development of small island developing\r\nStates as a crucial prerequisite in any attempt to make\r\nSIDS/TAP operational. We are heartened by the willingness\r\nof UNDP to take immediate steps to attend to this need\r\nwithin its information referral system (INRES) programme.\r\nSIDS/NET is an exciting and innovative concept\r\nwhich has the potential, through the promotion of\r\nexchanges of data, information and experiences among\r\nsmall island developing States, to counter the disadvantages\r\nof size and remoteness. Likewise, it can serve as an\r\nimportant catalyst for forging closer inter-island\r\ncollaboration among all stakeholders in island societies, on\r\na variety of priority issues and shared concerns relating to\r\ntheir sustainable development. SIDS/NET, in conjunction\r\nwith SIDS/TAP, is an invaluable tool for addressing the\r\nsubstantive actions proposed in the Programme of Action.\r\nWe hope that ongoing consultations among all\r\ninterested parties on the UNDP feasibility study will\r\nproduce early agreement on the final scope, modalities\r\nand funding for this important project. In this context,\r\nCARICOM countries wish to stress that, beyond the goal\r\nof providing connectivity to enable small island\r\ndeveloping States to access existing global networks and\r\ndatabases, the single most important component of\r\nSIDS/NET remains the development of capacity within\r\nthe islands themselves to be the primary generators of\r\ninformation for the network. While it is clearly important\r\nfor small island developing States to be able to benefit\r\nfrom access to up-to-date global sources of knowledge,\r\nthe full potential of SIDS/NET would not be realized if\r\nthis were to be the only result. The information\r\ncomponent of SIDS/NET must be predominantly driven\r\nby small island developing States if the vast indigenous\r\nknowledge base of these States is to be effectively\r\nharnessed to their common benefit. We are confident that\r\nthere is scope to address this critical element in a\r\ncost-effective manner within the training, staffing and\r\nmarketing components of the project and through the\r\ncareful design of the menus of the eventual SIDS/NET.\r\nTo this end, a comprehensive consultation should be held\r\nin the start-up phase of the project. This consultation\r\nshould involve the relevant expertise from small island\r\ndeveloping States, and should aim at establishing\r\npriorities and modalities for the systematic compilation,\r\ngeneration and dissemination, by and among small island\r\ndeveloping States themselves, of material relevant to their\r\nsustainable-development goals.\r\nA welcome feature of the Global Conference was the\r\neffective advocacy and support role played by a\r\nsignificant number of non-governmental organizations.\r\nThe Conference process served as an important catalyst\r\nin forging alliances between island non-governmental\r\norganizations from different regions, which had not\r\npreviously had the opportunity for interaction. It also\r\nprovided fertile ground for the development of a valuable\r\npartnership between northern and southern non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in addressing sustainable-\r\ndevelopment issues in an islands context. Through this\r\ninteraction, many useful proposals were produced which\r\nwe are confident will now be further developed for\r\nimplementation. The CARICOM delegations look forward\r\nto the continued cooperation and support of the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\ncommunity of non-governmental organizations in the\r\nimplementation of the Conference outcomes.\r\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States was\r\nmodest in design, practical in arrangements and focused in\r\nobjectives. While it may not have captured international\r\nheadlines, the Conference quietly and painstakingly laid the\r\ngroundwork for an irreversible process of national, regional,\r\nintra-regional and international cooperation in support of the\r\nsustainable-development efforts of small island developing\r\nStates. The CARICOM Governments are greatly\r\nencouraged by the level of understanding the process has\r\ngenerated for the special circumstances and economic and\r\necological vulnerabilities of small island developing States.\r\nThe Programme of Action provides a practical means of\r\ntranslating that understanding into a collective response. For\r\nthe members of the Caribbean Community, and of the\r\ncommunity of islands everywhere, the process has served\r\nto deepen the bonds which islanders intuitively share, and\r\nhas strengthened our resolve to work together in pursuit of\r\nour shared development aspirations. We are confident that\r\nour efforts will be matched by a significant demonstration\r\nof commitment by the international community as we\r\nfinalize our strategy for the implementation of the important\r\noutcomes of the Barbados Conference.\r\nMr. Palsson (Iceland): Let me at the outset associate\r\nmyself with the condolences that have been expressed to\r\nthe victims of the disastrous floods, tragic events, in Egypt\r\nlast week.\r\nSpeaking on behalf of the Nordic countries, I wish to\r\nsay that the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held in\r\nBarbados earlier this year, represented an important step in\r\nthe implementation of the results of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development.\r\nThe main accomplishment of the Barbados Conference\r\nwas the adoption of a Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates. The Programme is both ambitious and\r\ncomprehensive, and focuses on practical steps at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels to address crucial\r\nenvironmental and development concerns of small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nThe Conference also adopted an important\r\nDeclaration — the Barbados Declaration. It spells out the\r\nrespective political commitments of small island developing\r\nStates and of the world community, and highlights the\r\nimportance of public and private partnership as well as of\r\nregional and international co-operation for the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island developing States.\r\nThe Programme of Action identifies realistic means\r\nand measures for increasing the capacity of small island\r\ndeveloping States to cope effectively with their\r\nenvironment and development problems. It underscores\r\nthe role and importance of major groups,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector in\r\nthe promotion of sustainable development. Moreover, it\r\nidentifies important global objectives and measures to\r\nensure that the global environment and economic\r\ncircumstances will in the future be conducive to the\r\nsustainable development of small island developing States.\r\nThe Programme of Action offers the States\r\nconcerned a tangible instrument for pursuing sustainable\r\ndevelopment at the national and regional levels. It also\r\nprovides donors and relevant organizations with a\r\nframework to assist them in ensuring that their\r\ncontributions contribute to strengthening the capability of\r\nsmall island developing States to deal effectively with\r\ntheir environmental and development challenges.\r\nEffective implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction at all levels — national, regional and\r\ninternational — is not only important for the small island\r\ndeveloping States, but also imperative for the global\r\ncommunity. Let us bear in mind that it is not the size of\r\na country or its wealth which determines its contribution\r\nto the conservation of our global environment. With the\r\nentry into force of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, small island developing States bear\r\nresponsibility for a large part of the world’s oceans, and\r\nthus will play a pivotal role in the conservation of the\r\nEarth’s biological diversity.\r\nMr. Yadav (India): I am happy to address the\r\nAssembly today, when we have to some extent achieved\r\none of the objectives that we set for ourselves at Rio.\r\nAlong with the establishment of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development and the successful conclusion of\r\nthe negotiations on the elaboration of a Convention to\r\nCombat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing\r\nSerious Drought and/or Desertification, the agreement on\r\nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States is a\r\nmatter of satisfaction.\r\nIndia was among the countries that participated\r\nactively in the process leading up to the elaboration of the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nProgramme of Action and in a very successful meeting that\r\ntook place in the serene environment of the beautiful island\r\nof Barbados. The Indian delegation to the Conference was\r\nled by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Andaman and\r\nNicobar Islands, an island territory of my country. This\r\nisland chain comprises almost 300 islands, with a\r\npopulation of about 300,000 people. It embodies some of\r\nthe experiences relevant to the problems of ecological\r\nfragility and economic difficulties being faced by the small\r\nisland developing States.\r\nThe Programme of Action adopted at Barbados\r\nappropriately recognized that small island developing States\r\nand also islands supporting small communities would\r\nrequire special programmes and approaches appropriate to\r\ntheir special situations, problems and needs if we are to\r\neffectively tackle the question of their environment and\r\ndevelopment. They embody a unique and peculiar\r\ncombination of vulnerability to ecological fragility, natural\r\ndisasters and the vagaries of the international economic\r\nsituation. The small size of their populations, resource base\r\nand market, their relative geographic isolation and wide\r\ndifferences in ecological and geographical characteristics\r\nhinder their ability to embark on self-sustaining\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAlthough my own country is a large, subcontinental\r\nland mass, we ourselves have some experience of the\r\nproblems faced by small islands supporting small and\r\nisolated communities. Some of these islands are\r\ngeographically distant from the mainland. To tackle their\r\nspecial problems, the Government of India has in fact set\r\nup an Island Development Authority, under the\r\nchairmanship of the Prime Minister himself. This is ample\r\nproof of the importance that we attach to the particular\r\nproblems of small islands. The Authority has been\r\nmandated with the task of formulating policies and\r\nprogrammes for the ecologically sound, suitable and\r\nintegrated development of the relatively remote islands\r\nsustaining small communities.\r\nOur approach to the sustainable development of these\r\nislands, inter alia, involved programmes for maintenance,\r\nregeneration and restoration of the ecosystem. We have\r\npursued this in the belief that degradation of the ecosystem\r\nnot only further impoverishes the poor, but also affects the\r\nability of the environment to remain productive.\r\nProgrammes for regeneration, on the other hand, aside from\r\nrestoring productive potential, also provide employment to\r\nlarge sections of the rural people and local communities. In\r\nour own experience, we have found that the creation of jobs\r\nfor ecological restoration often has relatively few\r\nrequirements, and the investment can often be marginal,\r\nwith significant returns.\r\nWe have also found in our experience that, in\r\nregeneration and ensuring sustainable use of natural\r\nresources, decentralization and involvement of local\r\ncommunities have been a more effective way of managing\r\nthe process. This, in turn, has required the creation of\r\nappropriate local bodies and institutional structures. These\r\nlocal bodies and communities also need to have access to\r\ninformation and professional knowledge so as to be able\r\nto call upon technical bodies, when required, for\r\nappropriate advice and support. In this context, human-\r\nresource development and administrative capacity-building\r\nbecome significant.\r\nThe development of relevant and effective science\r\nand technology and their application to the sustainable use\r\nand development of the ecosystem require an interactive\r\nprocess between the scientific community and the final\r\nuser. Often, advances in the scientific understanding of\r\nnature and natural processes have not been shared or\r\ngenerated in partnership with the people, especially the\r\nrural, tribal or isolated communities. It is now widely\r\nrecognized and appreciated that most of these\r\ncommunities have their own traditional wisdom and\r\npractices on these matters. There is an imperative need\r\nfor the enrichment that would follow from the synthesis\r\nof these two streams of knowledge.\r\nIt will be quite clear from the broad outline that I\r\nhave just delineated regarding our approach to and\r\nexperience with the problems of small island communities\r\nthat in the case of small island developing States the\r\nquestion of mitigating and reducing the impact of natural\r\nand environmental disasters, the management of wastes,\r\ncoastal and marine resources, freshwater resources, land\r\nand energy resources and so on would all need to be\r\npursued in an integrated manner. These efforts, in turn,\r\nwould have to be supported through the development of\r\nenabling national institutions and administrative capacity,\r\nhuman-resource development, science and technology and\r\ntechnical cooperation, as well as a clear and manifest\r\ninternational recognition of the obligation of partnership\r\nfor global sustainable and sustained development. In\r\nparticular, we feel that the questions of science and\r\ntechnology and finance need to be tackled on a priority\r\nbasis.\r\nThere is a clear need for investment in the\r\ndevelopment of technologies that can be applied on a\r\nsmall scale. These could be used for the development and\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nutilization of renewable energy sources, the tapping of fresh\r\nwater, and the provision of building materials and other\r\nresources. The developed countries and the transnational\r\ncorporations have invested considerable amounts in science\r\nand technology. However, not enough attention has been\r\npaid to technology that would sustain small or not-so-rich\r\ncommunities, even though it may not have significant\r\nimmediate spin-offs in terms of market-determined profits.\r\nIt may be well worth our while to consider in what manner\r\nincentives can be given to those who have the capability of\r\nengaging their efforts in the development of appropriate\r\ntechnology.\r\nTechnical and economic cooperation among\r\ndeveloping countries (TCDC and ECDC) will also be an\r\nimportant mechanism for the transfer and development of\r\nappropriate technology and the exchange of experience.\r\nOften, this has suffered in the past owing to a lack of\r\nadequate funds. The international community must also\r\nconsider in what way it can facilitate ECDC and TCDC,\r\nkeeping in mind the requirements of the small island\r\ndeveloping States, as well as the experience of other\r\ncountries in tackling the problems of islands supporting\r\nsmall communities. India, through its International\r\nTechnical and Economic Cooperation Programmes, has\r\nbeen sharing its experience and technical know-how with\r\nother developing countries.\r\nWe also feel that small island developing States\r\nrequire not just periodic infusions of assistance or\r\ntechnology, but their integration into a system which\r\nensures self-sustaining interactions for technological\r\nadvancement, economic growth, trade earnings and a\r\nreduced vulnerability to natural and economic uncertainties.\r\nSome steps will therefore have to be taken to ensure that\r\nthese States’ terms of trade do not decline, market access\r\nfor their products is assured, service industries are well\r\ndeveloped, and appropriate insurance schemes are made\r\navailable. Their integration into the global economic\r\nsystem, while ensuring self-sustaining development, is the\r\nreal challenge before us.\r\nMrs. des Iles (Trinidad and Tobago): I have the\r\nhonour of addressing the General Assembly on behalf of\r\nthe Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). In doing so,\r\nI should like to join the President and earlier speakers in\r\nconveying the condolences and sympathy of the members\r\nof the Alliance of Small Island States to the Government\r\nand people of Egypt on the loss of life and the destruction\r\ncaused by the recent floods.\r\nI should like to associate myself with the statement\r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Algeria,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Group of 77, and I would also\r\nat the outset express, on behalf of AOSIS, our deep\r\ngratitude and appreciation for thesupport and solidarity we\r\nhave received from the Group of 77.\r\nThe first Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States was\r\nsuccessfully concluded in Barbados on 6 May 1994. We\r\nare greatly indebted to the Government and people of\r\nBarbados for the effective support and facilities provided\r\nfor the Conference. I also wish to pay a special tribute to\r\nMs. Penelope Wensley of Australia for successfully\r\nguiding the work of the Preparatory Committee and the\r\nMain Committee, which proposed the Programme of\r\nAction for final adoption.\r\nThe fragility of island ecosystems and the\r\nvulnerability of our small economies to natural disasters\r\nand external factors were recognized by the international\r\ncommunity at the highest level during the 1992\r\nConference on Environment and Development. Chapter\r\n17, section G of Agenda 21 and the subsequent enabling\r\nresolution of the General Assembly represented the first\r\nsteps in giving effect to the determination to address\r\nthe sustainable development needs of small islands. We\r\nnow welcome the report of the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, (A/CONF.167/9 and Corrs. 1 and 2) and the report\r\nof the Secretary-General on “Action taken by the organs,\r\norganizations and bodies of the United Nations system to\r\nimplement the Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States”\r\n(A/49/425). The Alliance of Small Island States also\r\nwishes to express its appreciation to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for the prompt and\r\ntimely submission of the two studies which were\r\nrequested in the Programme of Action. However, we\r\nwould be less than honest if we did not at the same time\r\nexpress our disappointment that the United Nations\r\nSecretariat did not find it possible to act with similar\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\ndispatch in the processing and circulation of the UNDP\r\nstudies.\r\nThe Barbados Conference was an opportunity for\r\nStates to recommit themselves to the full implementation of\r\nthe Rio Agreements while focusing on a sustainable-\r\ndevelopment strategy for small islands within the\r\nframework of Agenda 21. The momentum gained in\r\naddressing the priority areas identified by the Conference\r\nwill only be sustained if the commitments made by all\r\nparties are kept so that the Programme of Action can be\r\ntransformed into concrete action through partnership\r\nbetween small island developing States and other members\r\nof the international community.\r\nSmall island developing States will continue to have\r\nthe main responsibility for their own development and for\r\nbringing that development onto a sustainable path. In this\r\ncontext most of the resources for the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action are expected to originate in small\r\nislands. This represents an immense challenge for\r\ndevelopment planning within our islands. An early\r\nassurance has been given by small island developing States\r\nat the highest levels that they are prepared to meet this new\r\ndevelopment challenge. Heads of State or Government of\r\nthe Alliance of Small Island Developing States (AOSIS)\r\nwho met in Barbados on 4 May 1994, re-emphasized the\r\nhigh priority that small island developing States place on\r\nsustainable development, particularly in light of their\r\nvulnerability to external security threats and natural\r\ndisasters, their limited land mass, fragile marine and\r\nterrestrial ecosystems and economic and trade imbalances\r\nwith developed countries. They also reconfirmed their\r\ncommitment to the decisions of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED)\r\nand their determination to pursue policies for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Against this background the Heads of State\r\nor Government of AOSIS expressed their strong\r\ncommitment to taking the necessary steps at the national,\r\nregional and international levels to ensure the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the Barbados\r\nConference.\r\nIt has been recognized that the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action must be pursued at three levels. At\r\nthe national level the collective efforts of Governments and\r\nall citizens and groups in society, in particular women,\r\nyouth and non-governmental organizations, must be\r\nharnessed to ensure that the goals of the Programme are\r\nmet. In this regard AOSIS was pleased with the level of\r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations from small\r\nisland developing States in the Conference. Special note has\r\nbeen taken of their expressed commitment to play an\r\nactive part as we move from Barbados to the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. Other\r\nnon-governmental organizations that participated actively\r\nduring the Barbados Conference also have an important\r\nrole in the implementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nMechanisms for the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction must therefore facilitate the continued engagement\r\nof non-governmental organizations internationally.\r\nThe role of regional initiatives in the quest for\r\nsustainable development is also fully recognized by the\r\ninternational community. For small islands the regional\r\napproach proposed in the Programme of Action will assist\r\nin overcoming some of the constraints of small size.\r\nRegional initiatives will also strengthen cooperation\r\namong small island developing States both within and\r\namong regions.\r\nMembers of AOSIS have already taken some\r\ninitiatives in the priority areas identified in the\r\nProgramme of Action. However, actions taken by small\r\nislands and their strong commitment to implement the\r\nProgramme of Action as a whole will not guarantee the\r\nattainment of the objectives of sustainable development in\r\nthe absence of a supportive international environment. As\r\na prerequisite for the empowerment of citizens of small\r\nislands to achieve their full potential in a suitable manner,\r\nthe problems of trade, debt, transfer of technology and the\r\noutward flow of financial resources must be addressed. At\r\nthe international level there is also a need for a tripartite\r\napproach involving small islands, the United Nations\r\nsystem and other members of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn this context members of AOSIS urge the\r\ninternational community to heed the call made by the\r\nGroup of Eminent Persons who met in Barbados prior to\r\nthe Conference to fulfil the commitments made at Rio\r\nduring the International Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment and to manifest a more determined attitude\r\nand approach in the process of implementing the\r\nProgramme of Action. The commitments made by the\r\ninternational community at Rio and in Barbados constitute\r\nthe foundation on which the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action is based. Failure to honour those\r\ncommitments would therefore compromise the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nMembers of AOSIS are pleased to note the contents\r\nof the report of the Secretary-General outlining the action\r\ntaken by organs, organizations and bodies of the United\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nNations system in the six months following the Barbados\r\nConference. We are encouraged by the action taken by the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in\r\naccordance with its mandate as the lead agency in\r\norganizing United Nations-system efforts towards capacity-\r\nbuilding at the local, national and regional levels and in\r\nfostering the collective effort of the United Nations in\r\nsupporting the implementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nThe feasibility study on a Small Island Developing States\r\nTechnical Assistance Programme (SIDS/TAP), when\r\nimplemented, will put in place an important instrument for\r\nfacilitating the implementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nWe are gratified that in the limited time available a\r\npractical modality was found, through the seminars\r\nconvened in Fiji and Barbados, to take into account the\r\nviews of small island developing States as requested in the\r\nProgramme of Action. With the full implementation of\r\nSIDS/TAP, each small island developing State will be in a\r\nposition to benefit from the experience and expertise of\r\nother small islands in devising strategies for addressing\r\ncommon problems. SIDS/TAP will not only enhance\r\ntechnical cooperation among small island developing States\r\nbut should also promote cooperation between small island\r\ndeveloping States and other developing countries. In\r\naddition, SIDS/TAP would allow interested parties to obtain\r\na global picture of available expertise on matters specific to\r\nsmall island developing States.\r\nThe feasibility study on the Small Island Developing\r\nStates Information Network (SIDS/NET) has successfully\r\ntranslated the concept of an information-exchange network\r\ninto a concrete and practical programme to facilitate the\r\nexchange of information among small island developing\r\nStates and to allow those States to obtain access to\r\ninformation at the international level. Members of AOSIS\r\nare of the view that the two studies should move to the\r\nimplementation stage as early as possible, given the fact\r\nthat both SIDS/TAP and SIDS/NET are important basic\r\ninstruments for facilitating the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action as a whole. Members of the Group\r\nare convinced that with some refinements, through technical\r\nconsultations between UNDP, small island developing\r\nStates and other interested members of the international\r\ncommunity, implementation of both SIDS/TAP and\r\nSIDS/NET could commence before we celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nWe welcome the steps taken by organs, organizations\r\nand bodies of the United Nations system to implement the\r\nProgramme of Action. We are pleased to note that some\r\norganizations have responded positively to the\r\nrecommendation in the Programme of Action to establish\r\nfocal points. The task forces established by others should\r\nassist in bringing a greater focus to the implementation of\r\nthe Programme of Action. In the case of the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),\r\nwhich has taken the decision to establish two regional\r\nsub-offices in the Caribbean and the Pacific, we agree\r\nthat closer proximity at the field level should result in an\r\nimproved response to the needs of the small island States\r\nserved by the offices.\r\nThe Programme of Action anticipated an important\r\nrole for the Regional Commissions in the follow-up to\r\nBarbados. We have therefore taken careful note of\r\nongoing projects which address some elements in the\r\nProgramme of Action. The four Regional Commissions\r\nare urged to speed up their review processes so that they\r\ncan concretize their support in the follow-up process. We\r\ncontinue to be of the view that the Regional Commissions\r\nshould be provided with the resources necessary to\r\nundertake the activities requested in the Programme of\r\nAction. In this regard we continue to support the\r\nstrengthening of the Economic Commission for Africa,\r\nthe Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific (ESCAP) Pacific Operations Centre and the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC) Subregional Headquarters for the\r\nCaribbean.\r\nOne of the areas which received intense scrutiny\r\nduring the Conference was the Secretariat support\r\nstructure which must be put in place to facilitate the\r\neffective follow-up to the Conference. By the end of the\r\nConference it was agreed that a clearly identifiable,\r\nqualified and competent entity within the Department for\r\nPolicy Coordination and Sustainable Development should\r\nbe put in place to provide Secretariat support for both\r\nintergovernmental and inter-agency coordination\r\nmechanisms.\r\nThere was also clear agreement on the broad\r\nfunctions of the Secretariat support structure. It must\r\nprovide substantive Secretariat support to\r\nintergovernmental and inter-agency processes relating to\r\nthe monitoring, review and coordination of the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action; it must act\r\nas a liaison and focal point for Governments, organs,\r\nprogrammes and agencies of the United Nations system,\r\nas well as for other relevant intergovernmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, on matters related to the\r\nfollow-up to the Conference and the implementation of\r\nthe Programme of Action; it must prepare reports to be\r\nsubmitted to the Commission on Sustainable Development\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nand other relevant bodies on the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action, drawing on input from all\r\nappropriate sources; and it must provide support, as\r\nappropriate, to other activities emanating from the\r\nProgramme of Action. Decisive action must now be taken\r\nto provide adequate resources to carry out these important\r\nfunctions.\r\nThe support of the United Nations Secretariat is\r\ncritical to the overall implementation of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action. Consequently, any deviation from\r\nthe consensus arrived at in Barbados would, in our view,\r\ncompromise the effective follow-up to Barbados. While the\r\ntasks of the entity will be many and demanding, and will\r\ninclude the promotion of the Programme of Action while at\r\nthe same time reaching out to small island developing\r\nStates, no elaborate structure has been requested. Rather,\r\nwe anticipate a limited number of professionals whose\r\ncollegiality, excellence and professionalism will match the\r\nchallenge. It is also anticipated that while the entity should\r\nbe identifiable, it will not operate in isolation: there should\r\nbe an ongoing process of mutual reinforcement of\r\ninformation and expertise between the small islands entity\r\nand the rest of the Department for Policy Coordination and\r\nSustainable Development in the overall work of the\r\nDepartment.\r\nThe Programme of Action represents the first\r\ncomprehensive strategy for sustainable development in the\r\nprocess of putting Agenda 21 into effect. Given its\r\ncomprehensive approach, its implementation represents a\r\nlitmus test of the challenges and opportunities associated\r\nwith such a strategy. The benefits should therefore be\r\nglobal, while the relative cost to the international\r\ncommunity is modest. Member States must reaffirm the\r\nagreements arrived at in Barbados and fulfil the\r\ncommitments made. This debate in the General Assembly\r\npresents the opportunity to take these steps. We look\r\nforward to the support of Member States for the draft\r\nresolution which will be submitted by the Group of 77 on\r\nthe follow-up to the Conference.\r\nMr. Wang Xue Xian (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): The Chinese delegation wishes to express its deep\r\nsympathy and condolences to the people and the\r\nGovernment of Egypt on the losses suffered as a result of\r\nthe floods in that country. We hope that, through the\r\nactivities of the Egyptian Government and with the support\r\nof the international community, the victims of the floods\r\nwill soon be able to reconstruct their homeland.\r\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held in\r\nBarbados in late April and early May this year, was an\r\nimportant follow-up to the Rio Conference. The\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action adopted by the\r\nConference recognize the unique features and needs of\r\nsmall island developing countries in respect of their\r\neconomic development and environmental protection.\r\nThose two instruments also call on the international\r\ncommunity, especially developed countries and relevant\r\ninternational agencies, to provide necessary financial\r\nresources and technologies in such areas as reduction of\r\nnatural disasters, coastal management, energy, and\r\nbiological diversity, with a view to helping small island\r\ndeveloping countries overcome difficulties and achieve\r\nsustainable development. We believe the actual\r\nimplementation of these instruments will play an\r\nimportant role in promoting the sustainable development\r\nof small island developing countries.\r\nSmall in size and geographically dispersed, small\r\nisland developing countries are confronted with such\r\ncommon problems as a paucity of natural resources,\r\ninconvenience in transportation, lack of economic\r\ndiversity and a high degree of dependence on foreign\r\ncapital and trade. A large number of them are among the\r\nleast developed countries. To make matters worse, they\r\nare also faced with such environmental problems as\r\necological fragility, global warming, rising sea level, and\r\nmarine and coastal pollution and are vulnerable to the\r\neffects of natural disasters. All these factors have\r\nseriously constrained their efforts to sustain their\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe sustainable development of small island\r\ncountries is inseparable from that of developing countries\r\nand the world at large. It is worth emphasizing that the\r\nsalient features of the historical background, geographical\r\nlocation, economic development and biological\r\nenvironment of small island countries show that many\r\nproblems they have to face in their economic\r\ndevelopment and environmental protection are not of their\r\nown making. Nor can they be solved by these countries\r\nalone. Therefore, while their own efforts are required in\r\nachieving sustainable development, international support\r\nis also indispensable. The international community should\r\nattach importance to the issue of the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island developing countries, and\r\ndeveloped countries in particular have unshirkable\r\nresponsibilities in this respect.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nThe sustainable development of small island\r\ndeveloping countries requires a stable and favourable\r\nexternal environment. However, owing to the fact that\r\ndeveloped countries have so far failed to fulfil the\r\ncommitments they undertook at the Rio Conference in\r\nterms of provision of capital and transfer of technology and\r\nof furnishing the financial resources for implementing the\r\nProgramme of Action, the small island developing countries\r\nstill face difficulties in their pursuit of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We are of the view that the primary task now\r\nis to implement the relevant resolutions and fulfil the\r\ncommitments already undertaken.\r\nThe international community, and especially the\r\ndeveloped countries, should take the specific action of\r\nproviding new and additional financial resources and\r\ntransferring environmentally sound technologies. This is the\r\nprecondition for international cooperation in environment\r\nand development, as well as a key factor in the pursuit of\r\nsustainable development in small island developing\r\ncountries.\r\nWe welcome the successful conclusion and the\r\nachievements of the Barbados Conference. The Chinese\r\nGovernment and people sympathize with the small island\r\ndeveloping countries, understanding their unique conditions\r\nand difficulties. We support their tireless efforts to enhance\r\ninternational cooperation and to find solutions to their\r\nproblems. China, for its part, will actively explore various\r\neffective ways of cooperating with small island developing\r\ncountries and in this way make its own contribution to the\r\nrealization of their sustainable development.\r\nMr. Cho (Republic of Korea): My delegation would\r\nlike to join you, Mr. President, and other representatives in\r\nexpressing sympathy and condolences to the people and\r\nGovernment of Egypt on the disastrous losses caused by the\r\nrecent flooding.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Declaration and the\r\nProgramme of Action adopted in Barbados last May. We\r\nappreciate the efforts of the United Nations system and of\r\nregional organizations towards the sustainable development\r\nof small island developing States, as well as those of\r\nGovernments providing bilateral and multilateral assistance\r\nto such States.\r\nSmall island States have a unique ecosystem, with\r\nmany rare and precious resources. Resource preservation in\r\nthese ecosystems not only helps to provide a solid basis of\r\nincome generation for the inhabitants, but also safeguards\r\nthe biodiversity of the world ecosystem. This is a critical\r\nconsideration, given that the destruction of the ecosystems\r\nof small island States has an irrevocably detrimental\r\nimpact on the Earth’s overall ecosystem.\r\nMy delegation believes that the two major threats to\r\nthe ecosystems of small island States are their own\r\ninternal development activities and the environmentally\r\nunsound production and consumption activities of the\r\noutside world.\r\nThe internal factors that contribute to the destruction\r\nof the natural environment of the small island States are\r\nthe overuse of natural resources needed for the basic\r\nsubsistence of the people and the inadequate disposal of\r\ninternally produced wastes, waste water and other\r\nhazardous materials. Even more detrimental to the\r\nenvironment of small island States are external, man-\r\nmade factors, such as climate change. My delegation is of\r\nthe view that concerted action should be taken\r\nimmediately and vigorously strengthened by the\r\ninternational community, as well as by small island\r\nStates, to prevent any possibility of future disasters. The\r\nfact that man-made damage to the environment can\r\nincrease the frequency and severity of natural disasters\r\nshould also be borne in mind.\r\nBecause of the scarcity of natural resources, limited\r\nland area, fragile ecosystems and other unfavourable\r\neconomic and environmental conditions that characterize\r\nsmall island States, these countries have encountered\r\ndifficulties in their efforts to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Given these limitations, special assistance\r\nfrom the international community is needed to address the\r\ndistinctive sustainable development problems of small\r\nisland developing States. My delegation would like to\r\npoint out that in the course of the negotiations that\r\nresulted in the Programme of Action there was\r\nconsiderable discussion on the section entitled\r\n“Implementation, Monitoring and Review”. My delegation\r\nbelieves that for the effective implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action human resources development\r\nshould be given the highest priority.\r\nHuman resources development can enhance the\r\nutility of limited natural resources — a fact that has been\r\nsubstantiated in many industrialized countries possessing\r\nneither a significant quantity nor a significant variety of\r\nnatural resources to support their current production and\r\nconsumption levels. Human resources development in the\r\nsmall island States can contribute to the effective and\r\ndiversified use of those States’ own natural resources in\r\na sustainable manner, leading to the achievement of a\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\ndiversified production structure and sound management of\r\nthe environment through reduced production of waste. My\r\ndelegation believes that the principal reason for\r\nemphasizing the importance of human resource\r\ndevelopment is that achieving the long-term, sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the small island States depends ultimately\r\nupon the residents of those States themselves.\r\nThe Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States is the first\r\nwork plan to be elaborated in order to implement the\r\nrelevant section of Agenda 21. We hope that the\r\ncommitments made at Barbados will be carried out\r\nfaithfully thus giving renewed momentum for the\r\nimplementation of other programme areas of Agenda 21.\r\nMr. Butler (Australia): I should like to begin by\r\nexpressing to the delegation of Egypt my own delegation’s\r\nprofound sympathy following the heavy losses suffered by\r\nthe Egyptian people as a result of the recent heavy\r\nflooding.\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the nine States\r\nmembers of the South Pacific Forum that are also Members\r\nof the United Nations: Fiji, Marshall Islands, Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,\r\nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and my own country,\r\nAustralia.\r\nThe outcomes of the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing States\r\nare an important achievement. Securing agreement on the\r\nDeclaration of Barbados and the Programme of Action for\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates was a significant achievement. But it also has a\r\ndeeper meaning. It would not have been possible without\r\nthe commitment of the small island developing countries to\r\nensuring that sustainable development would be a\r\ncornerstone of their future.\r\nWe express our gratitude and congratulations to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Barbados for the excellent\r\narrangements made for the Conference and for their\r\nsignificant contribution to its outcomes. We would also like\r\nto congratulate Australia’s Ambassador for the\r\nEnvironment, Penny Wensley, for her role as Chairperson\r\nof the Preparatory and Main Committees and for her skill\r\nand persistence in achieving constructive outcomes from the\r\nConference.\r\nImportant initial steps were taken at the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\r\n(UNCED) to make the cogent case that small island\r\ndeveloping States are a special case with particular needs\r\nwith regard to both environment and development.\r\nChapter 17, section G, of Agenda 21 represents those first\r\nsteps in recognizing the priorities of small island\r\ndeveloping States. The Declaration of Barbados and the\r\nProgramme of Action identify the next steps in putting in\r\nplace the necessary fabric to secure the future\r\nsustainability of small island developing States. For the\r\nisland countries of the South Pacific region, climate\r\nchange and sea-level rise, natural and environmental\r\ndisasters, coastal and marine management, biodiversity,\r\nfreshwater, waste management, land, energy and human\r\nresource development are keys to their future survival.\r\nA partnership is necessary at all levels —\r\ninternational, regional and national, as well as\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental — to preserve the\r\nmost important resources of small island developing\r\nStates: the human, cultural and natural resources. A\r\npartnership is necessary to address the ecological fragility\r\nand economic vulnerability of small island developing\r\nStates.\r\nIn our view, when the General Assembly adopts the\r\nProgramme of Action and the accompanying Barbados\r\nDeclaration, it will still be premature to congratulate\r\nourselves on our achievement. The time for\r\ncongratulations will come when we have followed\r\nthrough, when we have all made sure that these proposals\r\nare converted into effective action. The outcomes of the\r\nConference represent a major step forward, but more\r\nsteps are necessary in the all-important process of\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. The\r\ninternational community now needs to take these next\r\nsteps, and we view those steps as the test of the\r\ninternational community’s commitment to meeting the\r\ngoal of sustainable development of small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nI turn now to actions by South Pacific countries. The\r\nisland countries of the South Pacific region have not\r\ncome with empty hands to this partnership of which I\r\nspoke a few moments ago. Our forests, our atmospheres,\r\nour marine ecosystems and our human resources make an\r\nessential contribution to the sustenance and indeed the\r\nimprovement of the balance of life on our planet.\r\nMr. Ntakibirora (Burundi), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nMuch has already been done in the South Pacific\r\nregion to put into effect the commitments undertaken in the\r\nProgramme of Action. At a national level, a number of\r\ninitiatives have been taken in order to meet our\r\ncommitments. These include developing national\r\nenvironmental legislation and national environmental\r\nmanagement strategies. At a regional level, the South\r\nPacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) plays\r\nan invaluable role in coordinating regional action and\r\nproviding technical and policy advice to the countries of the\r\nregion. One example of this is the coordination provided by\r\nSPREP in the implementation of a regional biodiversity\r\nprogramme funded in part by the pilot phase of the Global\r\nEnvironment Fund.\r\nThis level of commitment to the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the natural resources of the region was\r\nreaffirmed by Heads of Government at the twenty-fifth\r\nSouth Pacific Forum meeting held in Brisbane, Australia,\r\nin August of this year. Heads of Government endorsed the\r\nProgramme of Action emanating from the Conference. They\r\nalso stressed the importance of effective implementation of\r\nthe recommendation in the Programme of Action for\r\nachieving sustainable development in the region.\r\nA regional mechanism to coordinate and facilitate\r\nimplementation of the Conference’s outcomes, as\r\nrecommended in paragraph 132 of the Programme of\r\nAction, has now been established with the convening of an\r\nadvisory committee of senior officials and through\r\ncoordination arrangements between SPREP and the Pacific\r\nOperations Centre of the Economic and Social Commission\r\nfor Asia and the Pacific.\r\nResponding to the urgent need to address resource\r\nmanagement issues in the region, an unprecedented range\r\nof measures was adopted by the Heads of Government at\r\nthe South Pacific Forum. These include measures to\r\npromote sustainable development and environmental\r\nprotection, including in the areas of climate change and sea-\r\nlevel rise, sustainable management of fisheries and forestry\r\nresources, coastal zone management — including coral\r\nreefs — biodiversity conservation and management of\r\nhazardous and radioactive wastes.\r\nThe countries of the South Pacific region consider the\r\nProgramme of Action to be more than an academic exercise\r\nfor the region. Rapid and effective responses to achieve\r\nsustainable development of the resources are fundamental\r\nto the survival of the island countries.\r\nWhat of actions by the international community? For\r\nthe reasons already mentioned, it is more important than\r\never that the international community, the United Nations\r\nsystem and other intergovernmental organizations fully\r\nimplement and integrate the Programme of Action into\r\nthe formulation of their priorities, programmes and\r\nactivities.\r\nIt will be critical for the United Nations system and\r\nother intergovernmental organizations to coordinate and\r\nto cooperate with the small island developing countries,\r\nregional bodies and bilateral donors for access to and\r\noptimum use of resources.\r\nAn important example of cooperative efforts to\r\nfurther the Programme of Action is in the preparation of\r\ntwo feasibility studies undertaken by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme on a small island developing\r\nStates technical assistance programme (SIDS/TAP) and a\r\nsmall island developing States information network\r\n(SIDS/NET). These feasibility studies are a valuable\r\ncontribution to our deliberations on how further to\r\nimplement the objectives and outcomes of the\r\nConference. Over the coming weeks, careful consideration\r\nmust be given to finding a means to further the work\r\ncontained in the reports and to put those reports into\r\naction as soon as possible. It is thus unfortunate that these\r\nreports have not been translated and circulated more\r\nexpeditiously.\r\nThere are a number of other practical measures\r\nwhich should be adopted by financial and development\r\ninstitutional agencies, such as the World Bank, the Global\r\nEnvironment Facility and regional development banks,\r\nand which will contribute to meeting the commitments\r\nand objectives of the Programme of Action. For example,\r\nstrategies must be developed to assist capacity-building in\r\nsmall island developing States. There would be\r\nconsiderable value in improving the accessibility of the\r\ntypes of assistance available from various institutions and\r\nagencies, including through circulating to Governments of\r\nsmall island developing countries and regional\r\norganizations clear, detailed and user-friendly guidelines\r\non how funding can be accessed and the purposes to\r\nwhich funding can be applied.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the restructuring and\r\nreplenishment of the Global Environment Facility and its\r\ncontribution to sustainable development in the South\r\nPacific region. We would welcome the Facility’s future\r\nefforts to facilitate access to technical and financial\r\nresources in support of sustainable development of the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nSouth Pacific island countries and to support projects that\r\ncover more than one of the four areas of the Facility.\r\nThe international community is obliged to pay close\r\nattention to monitoring progress on the implementation of\r\nthe Programme of Action. The outcomes of the Conference,\r\nand their implementation, must become fully integrated into\r\nthe work programme of the United Nations Commission on\r\nSustainable Development. In accordance with the\r\nConference recommendations, the Commission needs to\r\ntake a central role in monitoring and reviewing\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. We are\r\nconfident that appropriate steps will be taken by the\r\nSecretariat and the Commission to integrate this new\r\nresponsibility, in a distinct and identifiable manner, in its\r\nfuture work programme.\r\nTo this end, in keeping with the commitments in the\r\nProgramme of Action, appropriate levels of staffing\r\nresources must be focused in the United Nations\r\nDepartment for Policy Coordination and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and dedicated to effectively carrying out the\r\nfunctions and objectives envisaged under the Programme of\r\nAction. In our view, these functions can be undertaken\r\neffectively only through additional resources, which are to\r\nform part of the entity envisaged under the Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nWe also emphasize paragraph 134 of the Programme\r\nof Action, which states that United Nations regional\r\ncommissions shall implement the Programme of Action at\r\nthe regional level, providing autonomy and adequate\r\nresources to subregional offices and operational centres. In\r\nthe case of the South Pacific region, the overwhelming need\r\nfor on-the-ground accessibility to United Nations\r\ncommissions by small island developing countries is at the\r\nsub-regional level.\r\nThis statement has made three main points, and I\r\nshould like to end by emphasizing that they are important\r\nand form an integral whole. First, the outcomes from the\r\nBarbados Conference are vital in the overall framework for\r\nsecuring sustainable development of small island countries.\r\nSecondly, implementation of the Programme of Action is\r\nthe yardstick against which future actions will be measured.\r\nAnd finally, we urge the international community to meet\r\ntheir commitments under the Programme of Action in order\r\nto contribute to the future sustainability of the island\r\ncountries of the South Pacific region.\r\nMr. Keating (New Zealand): I too should like to\r\nbegin by joining my delegation’s condolences to those of\r\nmy colleagues who spoke earlier to the Government and\r\npeople of Egypt at the losses that they have incurred in\r\nrecent days.\r\nFor the South Pacific, one of the most important\r\ninternational events of 1994 was the Global Conference\r\non the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States. New Zealand has a particular interest\r\nin this subject, and we are delighted that the Conference\r\nwas hosted by one of the members of the Alliance of\r\nSmall Island States (AOSIS). We should like to express\r\nour thanks and appreciation to the Government and\r\npeople of Barbados for their generosity in hosting the\r\nConference and in providing such good conference\r\nfacilities. This proved to be a most appropriate setting for\r\nthe coming of age of the global community of small\r\nisland States.\r\nThe Barbados Conference was widely viewed as a\r\ntest of the acceptance, in the wake of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, of global\r\nresponsibility for sustainable development, recognizing in\r\nparticular that small islands are grappling with a set of\r\nenvironmental and development challenges that are not\r\nnecessarily of their own making. Global problems such as\r\nmarine pollution, climate change and ozone depletion\r\nrecognize no national boundaries. Nor can the rest of the\r\nworld ignore the unique contribution of small island\r\ndeveloping States to global sustainability, through their\r\nrich biodiversity, their vast areas of marine resources and\r\ntheir coral reef ecosystems.\r\nAgainst that background, the successful conclusion\r\nat the Conference of a comprehensive Programme of\r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small Islands\r\nrepresents an enormous achievement. We moved, in the\r\ncourse of a single year, from what was essentially a\r\nconsciousness-raising exercise to conclude, in Barbados\r\nin May 1994, a policy blueprint that specified measures\r\nat national, subregional, regional and international levels\r\nto support the sustainable development of small islands\r\ninto the twenty-first century.\r\nAgreement on the Programme of Action has brought\r\nus now to a critical stage. We need to ensure that the\r\nenormous effort the international community put into the\r\nBarbados Conference is carried forward and what we\r\nhave achieved is not lost. In this statement, I propose to\r\nmake a few comments about how we, the international\r\ncommunity, should now proceed to implement the\r\nProgramme of Action. Secondly, I wish to touch on\r\nspecific issues relating to the follow-up to the Barbados\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nConference that we need to address at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nPrimary responsibility for implementation of the\r\nProgramme rests with the small islands themselves. But,\r\nequally, the Programme of Action recognizes that islands\r\ncannot make it happen alone. Regional and international\r\nefforts in support of small islands are necessary.\r\nThe central message is that donor countries and\r\nagencies have to recognize in their programmes the\r\npriorities of small island developing States. Development\r\nassistance should be managed in partnership with recipient\r\nGovernments and coordinated with other donors, with the\r\nGlobal Conference’s Programme of Action always in mind.\r\nThis partnership is necessary, among other things, to ensure\r\nthat programmes have the full support of recipient\r\nGovernments and that they do not place an undue\r\nadministrative burden on small islands.\r\nAs far as New Zealand is concerned, over two-thirds\r\nof its development assistance is spent in the small islands\r\nof the South Pacific. We are in the process of measuring\r\nour objectives and activities against those articulated in the\r\nProgramme of Action, which will remain an essential\r\nprogramming tool for New Zealand in the coming years.\r\nAs recognized in the Programme of Action, strong\r\nregional cooperation and robust regional institutions are\r\nessential, given the small size of the small islands and the\r\nlimited financial and human resources available to them. In\r\nthis regard, in our region crucial roles are played by the\r\nSouth Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)\r\nand by the South Pacific Forum, which brings together each\r\nyear the 15 Heads of Government of the South Pacific.\r\nAs mentioned in the South Pacific Forum statement\r\ndelivered by the representative of Australia on behalf of the\r\nForum, the countries of the South Pacific agreed last month\r\nto establish a specific regional consultative mechanism to\r\ncoordinate and facilitate implementation of the Barbados\r\noutcomes in our region. The Advisory Committee will be\r\nmade up of SPREP members. These comprise 22 Pacific\r\nisland States and territories, the two developed countries of\r\nthe Pacific — Australia and New Zealand, and the three\r\nmetropolitan Powers with responsibilities in the region:\r\nFrance, the United States and the United Kingdom. Other\r\ndonor countries, the United Nations and intergovernmental\r\nagencies that are active in the Pacific, and the community\r\nof non-governmental organizations will be invited to\r\nparticipate in the work of the Advisory Committee. This\r\nwill provide a wide-ranging participatory process that will\r\nact in effect as a sustainable development Commission for\r\nthe South Pacific. This proposal has our full support. New\r\nZealand strongly believes that the follow-up to the\r\nConference must be a transparent and inclusive process if\r\nit is to be effective.\r\nI now turn to the particular responsibilities we have\r\nat this session of the General Assembly. First, we need to\r\ndirect the various components of the United Nations\r\nsystem to implement the Programme of Action. The\r\nreport prepared by the Secretariat suggests that many of\r\nthe key United Nations actors involved in follow-up are\r\nstill in the process of developing implementation\r\nstrategies. We urge the United Nations organizations —\r\nparticularly the United Nations Development Programme,\r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme and the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development,\r\nwhich are singled out for particular attention in the\r\nProgramme of Action — to give higher priority to this\r\ntask.\r\nIt will be the responsibility of the Inter-Agency\r\nCommittee on Sustainable Development to ensure that\r\nUnited Nations agencies play their part. The Inter-Agency\r\nCommittee should be transparent in its reporting,\r\nidentifying clearly where any problems lie, so that\r\nappropriate follow-up action can be taken by Member\r\nStates. As outlined in the Programme of Action,\r\nintergovernmental monitoring of its implementation will\r\nbe primarily through the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nSecondly, we need to agree on United Nations\r\nSecretariat support arrangements appropriate to the\r\ncombined tasks of ensuring effective follow-up to the\r\nProgramme of Action and serving as liaison and an\r\ninformation point for small islands on issues relevant to\r\nsmall islands under discussion in the United Nations,\r\nincluding climate change.\r\nNew Zealand favours a dedicated unit within the\r\nDepartment for Policy Coordination and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. This concept is already implicit, we\r\nbelieve, in the provision made in the Programme of\r\nAction for a separate and identifiable entity. If resources\r\nare dispersed throughout the Department, we fear that\r\nsmall islands will lose access and the system will lose\r\naccountability.\r\nNew Zealand also believes that staffing levels must\r\nbe realistic in terms of the broad range of tasks identified\r\nin the Programme. We strongly support the view of the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nAssociation of Small Island States (AOSIS) that\r\nappointments to the regional commissions of the Economic\r\nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)\r\nand the Economic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC) must be made at the subregional level\r\nif we are to maximize the responsiveness of these\r\nCommissions to local and subregional concerns. I should\r\nlike to stress this point in particular in relation to the South\r\nPacific region. There is already a subregional body located\r\nin the area, the ESCAP Pacific Operations Centre in\r\nVanuatu. This is obviously the appropriate body to act as\r\nthe coordinating point for the United Nations in the South\r\nPacific. New Zealand envisages that with a modest boost in\r\nstaff resources that regional Centre will be able to work\r\nwith SPREP in fulfilling the mandate of the Barbados\r\nConference.\r\nAt this session of the General Assembly, we should\r\nalso give initial consideration to feasibility studies that have\r\nbeen prepared by the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) on a small island developing States\r\ninformation network (SIDS/NET) and a small island\r\ndeveloping States technical assistance programme\r\n(SIDS/TAP). These two proposals were called for in the\r\nProgramme of Action and relate to the development of an\r\ninformation network and a directory of institutions and\r\nscholars with expertise in the sustainable development of\r\nsmall islands. The two proposals are linked and should be\r\nconsidered together.\r\nWe should like to congratulate the UNDP for its\r\nprompt completion of comprehensive feasibility studies on\r\nSIDS/TAP and SIDS/NET. The studies canvas a number of\r\noptions for carrying forward the two proposals. These will\r\nnow need to be considered in detail. We endorse the initial\r\npremise of the feasibility studies — namely, that\r\nprogrammes should be non-duplicative and build on\r\nexisting technical assistance programmes and information\r\nnetworks. In addition, as recognized in the studies, the\r\nprogrammes will be managed and sustained by small\r\nislands themselves once we get beyond the initial start-up\r\nphase.\r\nAgainst this background, there is scope for further\r\nrefinement of the SIDS/NET proposal in particular. The\r\nquestion of costs and of necessary resource reallocation is\r\nobviously important, both for small islands and for donors.\r\nThe study notes that local needs and circumstances may\r\naffect cost projections and recommends that individual or\r\npossibly subregional feasibility studies now be done to\r\ndetermine specific solutions.\r\nThese stage-two feasibility studies may provide an\r\nopportunity for necessary refinements. In particular, we\r\nwould support a greater emphasis on training and\r\neducation and the possible extension of the\r\nimplementation timetable, taking into account services\r\nwhich may already be available to some individual small\r\nislands.\r\nFinally, we believe that the Barbados Conference\r\nsuccessfully completed its work. The international\r\ncommunity now has a comprehensive Programme of\r\nAction laid out before it. The test for all of us is whether\r\nwe will live up to the commitments we have made. The\r\npresence of large numbers of small island States in the\r\nUnited Nations is an important guarantee of this. But all\r\nother Members of this Organization must pledge their\r\nsupport, mindful that our Charter commits us to\r\ncooperation in dealing with the economic and social\r\nproblems which confront the global community. The\r\nconsensus achieved at the Barbados Conference shows\r\nthat this partnership does work.\r\nMrs. Fréchette (Canada): First of all, my delegation\r\nwould like to join other speakers in extending its\r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of Egypt\r\non their tragic losses in the recent flooding.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nMy delegation welcomes the successful conclusion\r\nof the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development\r\nof Small Island Developing States. The Conference is the\r\nfirst effort to apply the lessons of Rio to specific\r\ncountries. It is a model of how we can make Agenda 21\r\noperational and adapt it to a particular set of\r\ncircumstances.\r\nIt has often been said that small island States —\r\nbecause of their richness and isolation — are a\r\nmicrocosm of the world. What was certainly highlighted\r\nduring the Conference in Barbados is that small island\r\ndeveloping States face a unique environmental and\r\ndevelopmental situation: ecological wealth and fragility;\r\nclose interdependence of ecology and the economy;\r\nvulnerability in the event of natural disasters, climate\r\nchange and rising sea-levels; an absence of economies of\r\nscale; geographic isolation; population pressures; limited\r\nresources; and isolation from international markets.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nCanada is proud to have played a constructive and\r\nenergetic role in the Conference, contributing in excess of\r\n$300,000 to the Conference and its related activities.\r\nThroughout the negotiations, we were optimistic that we\r\nwould reach agreement and we share the satisfaction of the\r\ninternational community on the results. My delegation\r\nwould like to thank the other countries involved, especially\r\nBarbados, for the time and effort taken to bring about a\r\nsuccessful conclusion and for being such a gracious host.\r\nCanada would also like to thank the members of the\r\nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) for the leadership\r\nthey displayed in the organization of the Conference,\r\nalerting the world to the dangers of inaction and in bringing\r\nto the international community an enhanced understanding\r\nof the challenges they face.\r\nThe Programme of Action and Declaration give us\r\nroad maps for securing the future of small island\r\ndeveloping States. To get there, however, we will need to\r\nfollow through and carry out the actions envisaged. Canada\r\nis committed to doing so and has a long history of\r\ncooperative ties with small island States, particularly in the\r\nCaribbean. In 1995, Canada will contribute between $30\r\nmillion and $40 million to developing island States in the\r\nCaribbean to assist in efforts aimed at environment\r\nmanagement and protection and to help build capacity in\r\nenhancing economic competition.\r\nWe look forward to cooperating with our island\r\npartners on the implementation of the important outcomes\r\nof this Conference.\r\nMr. Slade (Samoa): I would like to start with an\r\nexpression to the delegation of Egypt of the warm feelings\r\nand sympathy of my delegation on the loss of life and the\r\ndestruction caused by floods in their country.\r\nSamoa welcomes most warmly the successful\r\nconclusion of the Global Conference held in Barbados\r\nearlier this year; and we want to take advantage of this\r\nfurther opportunity to thank and to congratulate all who\r\nworked hard in producing the Declaration of Barbados and\r\nthe Programme of Action that were adopted.\r\nOur own perspective on this subject centres on the\r\nhistoric work of the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED), for the case for\r\na global conference to concentrate on the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island developing States was\r\nestablished in Rio. There was a need to make that case\r\nbecause of the known vulnerabilities of small island\r\ndeveloping States and because by any global measure\r\nthey are a special priority for international action.\r\nThe particular importance of Barbados was that, for\r\nthe first time, small States engaged the international\r\ncommunity in an informed dialogue to map out the scope\r\nand priorities of the development of their islands and\r\nenvironment. What we now have in the Programme of\r\nAction is a comprehensive path to sustainable\r\ndevelopment. It contains the perspective not of one, but\r\nof many; not of a region, but of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nTruly, it is a blueprint for a global effort,\r\nincorporating the very realistic and very practical tripartite\r\napproach of national, regional and international actions. It\r\nis a call to arms, above all, to national Governments on\r\nthe basis of domestic initiative and self-reliance\r\npredicated on the need for international assistance and\r\ncooperation. It defines not merely the agreed priority\r\nareas for environmental and development planning but is,\r\nassuredly, a Programme of Action. It provides an\r\nopportunity for the international community to\r\ndemonstrate its commitment to the means of\r\nimplementation adopted in Agenda 21.\r\nEffective implementation, monitoring and review of\r\nthe Programme of Action is absolutely essential for the\r\nsustainable development of small island developing States.\r\nIt is the true test of commitment. Otherwise, we put at\r\nrisk the very considerable effort and input we have all\r\ninvested in the Barbados Global Conference and in the\r\npreparatory process that went before it. And we would\r\necho what the Secretary-General said in this Hall, in\r\nanother but similar context, that the failure of\r\nimplementation would render meaningless the historic\r\naccords and programmes of action so diligently and\r\nexpertly produced.\r\nFor our part, Samoa, in consultation with donor\r\npartners and appropriate United Nations agencies, is\r\nprogressing towards finalizing national proposals to build\r\non the Programme of Action and to guide donor activities\r\nand resources. A national Environment Management Plan\r\nis already in place to complement regional and\r\ninternational strategies.\r\nLike many other small island States, our\r\nGovernment and non-governmental groups are\r\nconsciously devoting extensive time and resources to our\r\nefforts to contribute to the current United Nations\r\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, as well as to the ongoing\r\nnegotiations on implementation of the law of the sea,\r\nbiodiversity and climate change Conventions. We were\r\nsimilarly involved in the Conferences held in Rio, Barbados\r\nand Cairo.\r\nWhile we recognize the need to sustain our efforts, we\r\nmust warn of the severe blow to the post-Rio optimism that\r\nwe fear will be induced by the absence of concrete\r\ncommitment on the part of the international community.\r\nIn negotiations on the Programme of Action, and since\r\nthen, we have been told to explore existing financial\r\nresources within the United Nations system to implement it.\r\nAnd this comes at a time when our Organization is facing\r\nserious resource constraints impacting on the abilities of\r\nGovernments to carry out programme activities. It is a\r\nresponse that does not readily generate confidence among\r\nthe small island States. From our perspective, what existing\r\nfinancial resources are in fact there? And how should small\r\nisland developing States effectively and realistically tap into\r\nthese existing financial resources? How, indeed, in the\r\ncontext of the Programme of Action we are now discussing,\r\nshould the United Nations address the question of\r\ndevelopment resources management and effective\r\nprogramme delivery and implementation?\r\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General for his report\r\nin document A/49/425 and Add.1, setting out the action\r\ntaken by the organs, organizations and bodies of the United\r\nNations system to implement the Programme of Action. My\r\nown delegation believes that a number of essential and\r\npractical measures would need to be taken — some of\r\nwhich could be taken now — if the objectives and\r\noutcomes of the Barbados Conference are to be realized.\r\nThese include the need to streamline United Nations\r\noperations to ensure that scarce resources are put to their\r\nbest use. We also think that administrative costs should be\r\nminimized, with priority given to programme activities.\r\nEqually, we think that the United Nations should take the\r\ninitiative and work more closely with its specialized bodies,\r\nregional organizations and other non-United-Nations\r\norganizations to minimize duplication of development\r\nactivities.\r\nAlso, a more focused and effective Commission on\r\nSustainable Development is, of course, vital in the\r\nmonitoring of all post-Rio outcomes, including the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action, which must be fully\r\nintegrated into the work of the Commission. At the\r\nforthcoming session of the Commission, the particular\r\nconcerns of small island developing States in forestry and\r\nin sustainable agriculture should be given close attention.\r\nWe are in no doubt that less bureaucratic, and more\r\neffective global funding mechanisms, such as the Global\r\nEnvironmental Facility, are essential. Furthermore,\r\nadditional resources would be needed in the event that the\r\nFacility becomes the sole global financial mechanism for\r\nthe environment and for the Conventions on biodiversity,\r\nclimate change and desertification.\r\nWe agree with the representative of India, who said\r\nthis morning that appropriate arrangements must be made\r\nat the international level to assist and improve trade\r\narrangements for small island developing countries in\r\nredressing adverse effects on their export capacities and\r\nearnings.\r\nIn the long term, more United Nations resources\r\nshould gradually be diverted from peace-keeping to\r\ndevelopment activities. At the same time, national military\r\nbudgets, which normally are large components of foreign\r\naid assistance, would need to be reduced.\r\nBut let me say it again — as much to my own\r\ncountry as for others: a key ingredient of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action is the need to match donor\r\nassistance with sound and responsible domestic policies.\r\nThe management of resources is a theme to which Samoa\r\nand its regional neighbours in the Pacific have committed\r\nthemselves in order to protect and to preserve what few\r\nresources we have.\r\nMy delegation greatly appreciates the two studies\r\nundertaken by the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) pursuant to paragraphs 105 and 106\r\nof the Programme of Action, namely the study for the\r\nimplementation of a Small Island Developing States\r\nInformation Network (SIDS/NET), and the study on a\r\nSmall Island Developing States Technical Assistance\r\nProgramme (SIDS/TAP) to promote interregional and\r\nintra-regional cooperation on sustainable development. We\r\ncongratulate UNDP particularly for the prompt and expert\r\naction taken, but more so for the manner of its\r\nundertaking: the full consultation; the utilization of\r\ne x i s t i n g s t r u c t u r e s ; t h e e m p h a s i s o n\r\ncapacity-improvement; and the attention given to the\r\nrequirements for suitability, efficiency and self-reliance.\r\nThis is a modus operandi, or the ingredients of one, for\r\neffective implementation, and we would commend it for\r\nthe general implementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nI should acknowledge that there are features of the studies\r\nthat may require further discussion. My own delegation\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nwould wish to participate in any consultations for that\r\npurpose.\r\nI also thank UNDP for the “Capacity 21” initiative and\r\nfor the Pacific Human Resource Programme being\r\nundertaken in our region. Our hope, of course, is that these\r\nprogrammes will fully take into account our circumstances\r\nand assist with the implementation of our national\r\nenvironmental management strategies.\r\nSamoa notes with appreciation from the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/49/425 and Add.1) the work\r\nbeing undertaken by various United Nations bodies to help\r\nsmall island States cope with the threats of climate change\r\nand of sea-level rise. This is a subject of the gravest\r\nconcern to my country and to all small islands. A whole\r\nchapter of the Programme of Action, significantly the first\r\nchapter, is devoted to it. Our concerns are manifold, serious\r\nand urgent; they have been expressed many times before,\r\nhere and elsewhere. Small islands are now experiencing\r\nincreasingly frequent immediate impacts from cyclones,\r\nstorms and hurricanes associated with changing weather\r\npatterns, their effects causing major setbacks to economic\r\ndevelopment. The fear of climate change and sea-level rise\r\nis real.\r\nBut we are also concerned about the commitments\r\nmade in Rio, more particularly the obligation undertaken by\r\nthe Annex I parties to the Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas\r\nemissions. My own Government, together with other island\r\nStates of our region, and as a member of the Alliance of\r\nSmall Island States (AOSIS), has consistently called for\r\nfurther and significant steps to be taken by the Annex I\r\ncountries to reduce their emission of carbon dioxide and\r\nother greenhouse gases. For reasons that we all know, the\r\nresponsibility for aversion and for containment in this\r\nmatter lies very largely with the industrialized countries.\r\nThat is why we, the small island developing States,\r\nhave sought to address this concern through the draft\r\nprotocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change on greenhouse gas emissions reduction.\r\nThe purpose and core provision of the draft protocol is to\r\nsecure new commitments on the part of the industrialized\r\ncountries to decrease their emissions of greenhouse gases\r\nby at least 20 per cent by the year 2005. Small islands are\r\nseeking to do this on the basis of available scientific\r\nevidence. It is acknowledged that the scientific evidence is\r\nnot clear cut. However, as related by the Secretary-General\r\nin his report on agenda item 89 (b) (A/49/485), it was\r\nstressed by the Chairman of the Intergovernmental\r\nNegotiating Committee for Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change at the Committee’s tenth session that the\r\nslow response of the climate system to measures to\r\naddress climate change argues not for delay but for action\r\nnow, despite the scientific uncertainty that may exist.\r\nMy own delegation would stress that the draft\r\nprotocol submitted is not a distraction, but is a serious\r\neffort on the part of the small island States, in line with\r\nthe outcomes of the Barbados Conference, to strengthen\r\ncommitments under the climate change Convention and to\r\ndemand of the industrialized countries the action that is\r\nneeded now and which they alone can meaningfully take.\r\nThe Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States has the\r\npotential to guide, in a sustainable development approach,\r\nour national development plans for the next two decades\r\nand beyond. To achieve success, and for its global\r\napplication, the Programme must itself be sustainable. It\r\nneeds the cooperation and the support of all of us to\r\nensure this.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines): The Philippine\r\ndelegation associates itself with the expressions of\r\nsympathy to Egypt offered by the President, by the\r\nChairman of the Group of 77 and by other speakers. The\r\nPhilippines is itself prone to natural disasters, so we\r\nunderstand fully the plight of the affected people of\r\nEgypt.\r\nThe Philippines associates itself with the statement\r\nof the Chairman of the Group of 77 on the matter the\r\nAssembly is discussing this morning.\r\nIt is difficult to think of the great work of the\r\nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and of the\r\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island States without feeling a sense of gratitude to\r\na diplomat and gentleman who did so much for AOSIS\r\nand the Barbados process — the former Ambassador of\r\nVanuatu, Robert Van Lierop.\r\nThe Philippines also congratulates Ambassador\r\nPenelope Wensley of Australia for her masterly guidance\r\nof the preparations for the Global Conference. We thank\r\nthe Government and people of Barbados for their\r\nhospitality and their excellent organization of the historic\r\nevent.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nThe Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,100\r\nsmall islands, understands the problems of small island\r\nStates and shares many of their concerns.\r\nThe commercialized image of the small island as\r\nparadise is often misleading. The truth is that many of the\r\nsmall island States are no longer self-sufficient hideaways\r\nfrom the active world. According to John Donne:\r\n“No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a\r\npart of the main”.\r\nToday, we could say: no island is an island complete in\r\nitself; every island forms part of the world.\r\nThe islands of the world have been invaded by ideas\r\nand images from the outside world — by artifacts and\r\nartifices, techniques and technologies, longings and desires\r\nwhich once were alien to them. The islands have\r\nthemselves ventured beyond their coastlines, and they have\r\nhad to face a highly competitive milieu.\r\nThis has been difficult. Most of them must cram to\r\nmaster ways — developed over generations — of technical\r\ndiscovery, innovation, refinement and usage. Though no\r\nlonger isolated, many of them remain remote from\r\ninternational ship lanes. When their populations exceed\r\ncomfortable density ratios, their resources are severely\r\ntaxed. But when, on the contrary, their people are too few,\r\ntheir production capabilities cannot benefit from economies\r\nof scale. Much too often, their imports far exceed their\r\nexports and their core export commodities are vulnerable to\r\nprice fluctuations beyond their control.\r\nConstrained in manufacturing and trading, they invite\r\ntourists to share in the beauty of their land and waters. But\r\nmore often than not, foreign visitors have spoiled their\r\nbeaches, shorn their forests, polluted their waters — and for\r\nso little, since wholesale tour operators, foreign carriers and\r\nsuppliers have amassed fortunes at their expense.\r\nThe small developing islands, fragile and vulnerable,\r\nare caught in a dilemma born of paradox. They are\r\nvulnerable to the onslaughts of the same nature which has\r\nmade them bountiful in flora and fauna. Storms and\r\ntyphoons, hurricanes and cyclones devastate them. Volcanic\r\neruptions — which had once made them emerge from the\r\nbowels of the earth — terrorize them; earthquakes and tidal\r\nwaves overwhelm them.\r\nBut it is not only to the vagaries of nature that the\r\nislands are vulnerable. They are also victims of the\r\ncarelessness and indifference of man. The warming of the\r\nglobe, which inexorably raises sealevels, threatening to\r\nsubmerge the Marshalls, the Maldives and many other\r\nplaces, can be traced to man’s injudicious use of elements\r\nwhich emit greenhouse gases. The pollution which\r\ndestroys coral reefs and depletes marine life can be traced\r\nto man’s carelessness in waste disposal, in handling toxic\r\nor hazardous substances.\r\nThe small islands are also vulnerable to the political\r\nand economic contests of bigger nations. How many of\r\nthem have been the staging areas for nuclear experiments\r\nor for the storage of radioactive substances? How many\r\nof the islands have received their just share from the\r\ncommercial exploitation of their diverse plant and animal\r\nlife used by biogenetic experts and bioengineers to\r\nproduce new life forms or products commanding high\r\nprices?\r\nThe task we face is how to make these islands less\r\nvulnerable. We may not be able to hold back the wrath of\r\nnature. But we may learn to forecast its changes of\r\ntemper, take appropriate preventive measures and thus\r\nminimize the adverse impact on life and property.\r\nRegional and subregional networking of early-warming\r\nsystems and relief mechanisms could be bolstered with\r\ninternational support. Regional and sub-regional\r\narrangements, with international assistance, could be made\r\nto obtain more comprehensive and cost-effective\r\ninsurance packages.\r\nMore important, we must manifest our collective\r\nresolve to control our own injudiciousness and\r\nimprudence in the use of substances which lead to global\r\nwarming, in the handling of hazardous materials, in\r\nmaking use of the islands and their seas as nuclear\r\nlaboratories.\r\nThe problems of the small islands also challenge\r\nother developing countries. Natural disasters, pollution of\r\nair and water, vanishing forests, drought, land erosion and\r\ndesertification, and depletion of coastal and marine\r\nresources also afflict other developing countries. Market\r\nbarriers, onerous terms of trade and external debt,\r\nshortage of financial resources and inequitable distribution\r\nof income: all these have often troubled other developing\r\ncountries.\r\nBut among developing countries in general, as\r\namong the small island States in particular, some are\r\nmore vulnerable — either to specific environmental and\r\neconomic problems or, by some quirk of fortune, to all\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nproblems. There are, therefore, many good reasons for the\r\nformulation of vulnerability indices for nations.\r\nWe believe that the Conference achieved at least two\r\nthings: first, a more profound respect for the positive\r\ncultural values and traditional strengths of the islands,\r\nproceeding from a symbiotic relationship with nature as\r\nwell as a realization of the fortifying role of families and\r\nsmall communities, of elders, of women, of youth and of\r\nchildren in island societies; and, secondly, a marshalling of\r\ninternational support to develop the national capacities of\r\nthe islands — those capacities which proceed not only from\r\ntheir indigenous and traditional cultures but also, and more\r\nparticularly, from what they have learned and obtained from\r\nother cultures and traditions, in order that they may be able\r\nto formulate policies and implement them more effectively\r\nin their pursuit of economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOur expectations of the Barbados Conference, in line\r\nwith key points of Rio, were: deeper appreciation of the\r\nright to development; provision of adequate financing; and\r\nfacilitation of technology transfer.\r\nOur expectations and the Conference’s achievements\r\nare linked to the most important resource of the islands —\r\nand, indeed, of all nations: the human resource, the person,\r\nwho is at the centre of all development effort. No matter\r\nhow exquisite nature has made the islands, it is the person\r\nwho remains the source of all wonder. He remains the\r\nprime agent as well as the principal beneficiary of his\r\nisland’s destiny.\r\nThe developing world watched to see how willing the\r\ninternational community — particularly the more affluent\r\ncountries and the multilateral financial institutions — was\r\nto assist the small islands. For the islands were a test case,\r\nas it were, to confirm the commitments of Rio, particularly\r\nin the Rio Declaration and in Agenda 21. What would be\r\ndone for the small developing islands by the world\r\ncommunity — apart from reminding them of what they\r\nthemselves could do and should do — would prefigure\r\nwhat could be done for other developing countries.\r\nWe were aware of the fact that financial resources are\r\nnot infinite, that developing countries cannot perpetually\r\nrely on external aid flows; but we sought an intelligent\r\nunderstanding of the specific vulnerabilities of certain\r\ngroups of developing countries, so that these could be\r\naddressed not only with goodwill but also with an\r\nintelligent allocation of resources where they were most\r\nneeded. For what benefits a group of nations, in terms of\r\nenvironmental protection and sustainable development,\r\nalso benefits the world. There is an intimate linkage\r\nbetween sustainable development and the continued health\r\nof our planet.\r\nNegotiations on the Barbados Declaration and on the\r\nProgramme of Action — particularly on provisions related\r\nto the international implementation aspects of finance, to\r\ntrade, to the transfer of environmentally sound\r\ntechnologies and to institutional arrangements — were\r\nintense. Both documents testify to the world enthusiasm\r\nthat was evident in Barbados.\r\nThere will be need for effective, action-oriented\r\nfollow-up and follow-through of our agreements and\r\ndeclarations. Only in this way may future generations be\r\nable to say that we did not work in vain; only in this way\r\ncan we keep the spirit of Barbados a vibrant paradigm of\r\nthat cooperation which will maintain the Earth as a\r\nfruitful haven for future generations.\r\nMr. Leung (Fiji): On behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Fiji, I should like to join previous\r\nspeakers in expressing my deep sympathy to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Egypt on the sad loss of\r\nlife that resulted from the recent floods.\r\nI am honoured to be able to intervene at this time to\r\nspeak on an issue of great relevance and interest to Fiji\r\nand to my region, the South Pacific.\r\nAs a small island developing State, Fiji was pleased,\r\nalong with other countries, to have participated in the\r\nUnited Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States recently\r\nheld in Barbados. We would happily associate ourselves\r\nwith those delegations which have already offered their\r\ncongratulations to the people and the Government of\r\nBarbados for their organizational skills and hospitality\r\nduring the Conference.\r\nThe discussion of this item in the Assembly now is\r\na good time to take stock. Looking back at the\r\nConference, it is appropriate to ask what it achieved and\r\nwhether it opened up any new opportunities for small\r\nisland States. While there was general agreement among\r\nmany small States on the need to assist each other with\r\nadvice and expertise, there is a real sense that when all\r\nthe rhetoric is analysed, little in the way of new financial\r\nresources and help has been promised to the small island\r\ndeveloping countries as a result of the Conference.\r\nRecalling the compact at Rio only two and half years ago\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nbetween the world’s rich and poor countries, the sincerity\r\nregarding the early attainment of some of the commitments\r\nthat were made at the Earth Summit is now increasingly\r\nbeing called into question. One is tempted to ask, in light\r\nof the apparent inertia of some developed States in\r\nproviding greater evidence of their commitments, whether\r\nthey are serious about the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment goals by smaller island countries, including\r\ndeveloping ones. History will not judge the success of the\r\nBarbados Conference on the number of statements that\r\nwere made or the number of delegations that attended. It\r\nwill look to examine what in the way of meaningful\r\ncommitments and practical outcomes have been achieved as\r\na result of it. In all frankness, I think we must acknowledge\r\nthat a significant view has emerged that overall, the\r\nConference was not the success it could have been.\r\nWhile we welcome the continued recognition that the\r\nunique economic and geographical characteristics of small\r\nisland developing States accord them a status deserving of\r\nspecial attention, recognition of itself will not solve the\r\nunderlying problems. This is not an attention that we have\r\nvoluntarily sought. Rather, it has been foisted upon us by\r\nan accident of nature, by the vagaries of the world climate\r\nsystem and by the past industrial and technological\r\nproduction processes of some developed States which\r\nignored fundamental principles related to the sustainability\r\nof the environment. It is a historical truism that island\r\ndeveloping States, while not responsible for this state of\r\naffairs, are nevertheless, because of their smallness,\r\ncontinued environmental victims of these past excesses.\r\nBut the Barbados Conference did have valuable and\r\nconstructive outcomes, and we would readily recognize\r\nthem. We welcome the initiatives that have been taken by\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on\r\nthe Small Island Developing States Technical Assistance\r\nProgramme (SIDS/TAP) and the information network\r\nSIDS/NET, and we join other countries in congratulating\r\nUNDP on the expeditious completion of these studies.\r\nThere is much potential benefit for small island developing\r\nStates in these initiatives, and we look forward to their\r\nearly fruition.\r\nWe also believe, for example, that the Declaration of\r\nBarbados and the accompanying Programme of Action are\r\nsignificant achievements in themselves. Taken together,\r\nthey can serve as a blueprint for enabling small island\r\ndeveloping States, when appropriately assisted, to realize\r\nthe goals of sustainable development. They also serve as a\r\ntimely reminder to the international community that the\r\nenvironmental challenges and problems of small island\r\ndeveloping States must continue to remain high on the\r\ninternational agenda. They will not and must not\r\ndisappear.\r\nWe must now continue to ensure that greater effort\r\nis made to implement the Programme of Action. In this\r\nregard, it will be a test of the political will and resolve of\r\nthe richer industrialized countries to the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island developing States to respond\r\nto the invitation before them to facilitate the early\r\ndelivery of assistance that would lend meaning to the\r\nhopes kindled at Rio and energized in Barbados.\r\nFiji shares the concerns and frustrations of an\r\nincreasing number of developing countries, including\r\nsmall island States, that although significant progress has\r\nbeen made in a number of areas, much more remains to\r\nbe done in the area of sustainable development. In\r\nparticular, it is the view of my delegation that universal\r\nagreement on the transfer of environmentally sound\r\ntechnology, endogenous capacity-building and human\r\nresource development and the establishment of additional\r\nfunding mechanisms are just some of the areas in which\r\ndeveloped countries could usefully assist island countries\r\nto better achieve the goals contained in the Declaration,\r\nas well as the Programme of Action. At the national level,\r\nFiji has established a National Environment Strategy\r\nwhich encompasses a number of projects. These include\r\nthe development of environmental impact assessment\r\nlegislation and the establishment of a spatially referenced\r\nnational environmental database to integrate the results of\r\nboth terrestrial and marine resource surveys. All in all, 14\r\nprojects have been identified under this Strategy. We\r\nthink that these are areas which could benefit from the\r\nkind of partnerships envisaged under Agenda 21.\r\nWe believe that the identification of a number of\r\nagreed priority areas in the Programme of Action as a\r\nbasis for future action is useful. We should now continue\r\nto ensure that discussions on this remain action-oriented.\r\nMany small island developing countries are separated by\r\nlong distances from the forums where environmental\r\nissues affecting them are discussed. They often cannot\r\nafford the expense associated with participation in these\r\nprocesses. In this connection, therefore, my delegation\r\napplauds initiatives such as voluntary funds, established\r\nfor example, in relation to the United Nations Conference\r\non Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks. We appreciate the contributions made by a\r\nnumber of countries to the fund, and thank them for their\r\ngenerosity in this regard. We believe that the concept of\r\nthe fund could be applied with equal success to other\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nenvironmental conferences and processes. However, there\r\nis a need to ensure the effective participation in and\r\nefficient convening of meetings affecting small island\r\nStates.\r\nWe sometimes feel that our concerns and aspirations\r\nare often overlooked because of our smallness and lack of\r\npolitical visibility. We therefore welcome the positive\r\nassurances by the United States, the European Union and\r\nothers, of support for the implementation of the Programme\r\nof Action. I would also refer to the comments made this\r\nmorning by the representative who spoke on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union concerning the setting aside of a\r\nsignificant amount of money for a period ending next year\r\nto assist the sustainable development efforts of small States\r\nand would encourage and thank the members of the\r\nEuropean Union in this regard.\r\nMy delegation supports the suggestion that the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development might play a\r\nvaluable and supportive role in the entire small-island-\r\ndeveloping-States process. We believe that the Commission\r\nmight be the right vehicle for engaging developed and small\r\nisland developing States to establish the kind of coalition\r\nthat could explore specific modalities to implement the\r\nProgramme of Action. On a related note, we also support\r\nrecent sentiments that the multitude of international\r\nprocesses related to the environment and sustainable-\r\ndevelopment efforts will need to be rationalized to eliminate\r\nduplication. We look forward, as a small island State, to the\r\nfinalization of the policy options and financial instruments\r\nand mechanisms under consideration by the Commission\r\nfor Sustainable Development and other United Nations\r\nbodies. Greater transparency in the deliberations and\r\nprocesses of the Commission would enable the views and\r\ninterests of small island developing States to be taken into\r\nconsideration during those processes.\r\nWhile there has been some progress following Rio and\r\nconsolidation of ground at Barbados, much more still needs\r\nto be achieved. However, we would like to thank our\r\nfriends in the international community who continue to help\r\nus towards the attainment of sustainable development goals.\r\nWe look forward to the opportunity to engage in a dialogue\r\non the forms of any possible future assistance with those\r\ndeveloped States that have come to our help in the past. I\r\nhave already identified a number of areas which would be\r\nripe for partnership in this regard.\r\nIn conclusion, our special plea is that small island\r\ndeveloping States have special vulnerabilities and deserve\r\nan equally urgent attention. This should not be forgotten.\r\nWe recognize that the post-cold-war international order\r\nhas necessarily brought about a shift in emphasis for\r\nsome of the larger developed States, resulting in a\r\nreordering of spending priorities in favour of economies\r\nin transition. We have no quarrels with that. Indeed, we\r\nare entirely supportive of those efforts. However, as a\r\nsmall island developing State our commitment to\r\nsustainable development goals will remain undiminished.\r\nWe will of course continue to carry a major responsibility\r\nfor the achievement of national objectives in the areas of\r\nenvironment and sustainable development efforts. We will\r\ncontinue to marshal available resources towards those\r\nobjectives, but we cannot do this alone and unaided. We\r\ntherefore look to our global partners in national\r\ndevelopment to join us in a cooperative effort as we strive\r\nto achieve these objectives. We are in this compact\r\ntogether, and worldwide sustainability will be threatened\r\nif we do not assist poorer island developing countries\r\nattain a level of development that takes into account their\r\nenvironmental concerns.\r\nIn the final analysis, although the Barbados\r\nConference was a qualified success, the international\r\ncommunity must now rededicate itself to the goals that\r\nled to that Conference, and for the world’s richer\r\ncountries to honour the promises they have made to help\r\nsmaller and ecologically fragile ones. Many of us have\r\nhad dreams since Rio. Many of us had our hopes and\r\nexpectations raised at that Summit. We now owe it to the\r\nfuture generations of mankind to ensure the realization\r\nthose dreams.\r\nMr. Chew (Singapore): I should first like to express\r\nmy delegation’s condolences to the delegation of Egypt\r\non the loss of life in that country as a result of the recent\r\nfloods and fire.\r\nThe Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and the\r\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States in Barbados this year\r\nunderscored how critical development and protection of\r\nthe environment are for developing countries, particularly\r\nthe small island developing States. At those Conferences\r\nthe international community recognized the problems\r\npeculiar to small island developing States. While such\r\nStates suffer from the same constraints in their\r\ndevelopmental process as all other developing countries,\r\nthey are further disadvantaged by special vulnerability\r\nfactors.\r\nIt is worth our while to take a few minutes to\r\nremind ourselves of the special vulnerability factors that\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nconfront small island developing States. First, they are,\r\nmore likely than not, inaccessibly located in the middle of\r\nlarge oceans. Isolation, with poor communications and\r\ntransportation links to the rest of the world, exacerbates the\r\nproblems of economic development for small island\r\ndeveloping States. In his book, Meditations of a Parish\r\nPriest, Joseph Roux correctly summed it up in 1886 when\r\nhe wrote that “solitude vivifies, isolation kills”.\r\nSecondly, small island developing States often\r\ncomprise more than one island. These components parts are\r\nthemselves often separated by vast stretches of sea, making\r\nadministration and control extremely difficult. To\r\ncomprehend this problem of separation, let me refer to\r\nRobert Louis Stevenson, who wandered around the Pacific\r\nin the late nineteenth century. He said that the sea “is a\r\nhorrible place” and that sailing the seas was “stupefying to\r\nthe mind and poisonous to the temper”.\r\nThirdly, small island developing countries often have\r\nvery small populations, which inhibits economic growth\r\nsince they lack economies of scale. Fourthly, the lack of\r\nnatural resources makes development even more daunting\r\nfor small island developing States.\r\nFifthly, tourism tends to be the only economically\r\nviable industry. Isolated islands have long been celebrated\r\nfor their beauty in novels by writers such as Melville,\r\nSomerset Maugham, Mark Twain, Stevenson and Michener,\r\nand by painters like Gauguin. However, tourism, if not\r\ncarefully managed, will eventually destroy the beauty and\r\nfine ecological balance of small island developing States.\r\nIn Barbados earlier this year the international\r\ncommunity adopted the Barbados Declaration and the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States. It is crucial for the\r\ninternational community to follow through with the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. Unless this is\r\ndone, the plight of these island developing States will\r\nworsen and their chances of survival decrease significantly.\r\nWhile we are all aware of the economic difficulties in the\r\nindustrialized world, those problems pale when seen in the\r\nlight of the problems in the developing countries. The\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, and in particular of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action, will reflect the political\r\nwill and commitment by the industrialized States to achieve\r\nsustainable development.\r\nAt Barbados it also became apparent that any follow-\r\nup to the Conference and the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action would require strong United Nations\r\nSecretariat support. In his report (A/49/425 and Add.1)\r\nthe Secretary-General has indicated that consideration was\r\nbeing given the issue of making available the resources\r\nnecessary to establish the entity. We would like to\r\nemphasize the importance of a speedy establishment of\r\nthe entity and to ensure that sufficient resources are made\r\navailable. Failure to do so would lead at best to delays in\r\nthe implementation of the Programme of Action and, at\r\nworst, to consigning it to the back burner.\r\nSingapore is convinced that substantial human,\r\nfinancial and other resources can be made available from\r\nwithin the existing and future regular budgets of the\r\nUnited Nations to establish the competent entity within\r\nthe Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of the United Nations Secretariat. We note\r\nthat similar efforts are being undertaken for human rights\r\nprogrammes. The linkage between development and\r\nhuman rights is explicitly recognized by the international\r\ncommunity in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction. It is our hope that the implementation of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action will help small island\r\ndeveloping States to promote social progress and better\r\nstandards of living in larger freedom and to achieve the\r\npromotion of the economic and social advancement of\r\ntheir peoples as provided in the Preamble to the Charter.\r\nAgenda item 103\r\nProgramme of activities of the International Decade of\r\nthe World’s Indigenous People: report of the Third\r\nCommittee (A/49/613)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): If there\r\nis no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I\r\nshall take it that the General Assembly decides not to\r\ndiscuss the report of the Third Committee that is before\r\nit today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French):\r\nStatements will therefore be limited to explanations of\r\nvote.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendations of the Third Committee have been\r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the\r\nrelevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401 the General Assembly agreed that\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\n“When the same draft resolution is\r\nconsidered in a Main Committee and in plenary\r\nmeeting, a delegation should, as far as possible,\r\nexplain its vote only once, i.e., either in the\r\nCommittee or in plenary meeting unless that\r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is\r\ndifferent from its vote in the Committee.”\r\nMay I also remind delegations that, also in\r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 34/401,\r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Third\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that we\r\nare going to proceed to take a decision in the same\r\nmanner as was done in the Third Committee.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft\r\ndecision recommended by the Third Committee in\r\nparagraph 5 of its report (document A/49/613).\r\nThe draft decision, entitled “Opening of the\r\nInternational Decade of the World’s Indigenous People”,\r\nwas adopted by the Third Committee. May I consider that\r\nthe Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\nshould like to inform delegations that the General\r\nAssembly will observe the opening of the International\r\nDecade of the World’s Indigenous Peoples on Thursday,\r\n8 December 1994.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 103.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.\r\n28\r\n"
