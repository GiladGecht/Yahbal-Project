(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Pak Gil Yon\r\n(Democratic People’s Republic of Korea),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 89 (continued)\r\n(e) Global Conference on the Sustainable Development\r\nof Small Island Developing States\r\nReport of the Conference (A/CONF.167/9 and\r\nCorr.1 and Corr.2)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/49/425 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nNotes by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreports of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (A/49/414 and A/49/459)\r\nMr. Hurst (Antigua and Barbuda): When my Prime\r\nMinister, Mr. Lester Bryant Bird, addressed the General\r\nAssembly four weeks ago, he said:\r\n“while the United Nations has been a symbol of hope\r\nfor people from small countries such as mine, much\r\nremains for it to do before it can represent to them an\r\norganization which ... upholds the rights of their small\r\nnations, which promotes their social progress and\r\nbetter standards of life.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 20th meeting, p. 19)\r\nThe United Nations Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, which was held in Barbados last April and May,\r\nsurely inspired greater hope in the minds of people from\r\nsmall countries. This was the first time in history —\r\ncertainly the first time in the history of the United\r\nNations — that small island States had become the focus\r\nof the Organization’s special attention.\r\nHowever, it certainly was not the first time in history\r\nthat small islands had become the focus of international\r\nattention. Between 1492 and 1763 empires were built by\r\nthe forceful acquisition of small islands in the Caribbean.\r\nThese were jewels in the crown of many a prince. In\r\n1763, for example, two Caribbean islands — islands not\r\nmuch larger than mine — were exchanged by warring\r\nPowers, in a peace treaty, for what is today the second\r\nlargest nation on Earth. Such was the value of small\r\nislands in the days before the industrial revolution, when\r\nthe Caribbean produced great wealth for mighty nations.\r\nToday the wealth of the islands of the Caribbean is\r\nto be found in its people and their institutions, its\r\nbiodiverse flora and fauna, its tropical reefs and tropical\r\nrain forests and its incredible natural beauty. Hundreds of\r\nmillions of people, primarily from the industrialized\r\ncountries, have come to stare at our beauty, to learn a\r\nlittle of our history and to seek respite from a harried life\r\nin their maddening metropolises.\r\nCan the United Nations be more than “a symbol of\r\nhope” to people from small island nations? Can the\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nUnited Nations promote a better standard of life for people\r\nfrom small island States? Can the United Nations uphold\r\nthe right of small island nations to exist free from the threat\r\nof environmental destruction? Much remains for the United\r\nNations to do before it can claim to represent these\r\nlegitimate aspirations.\r\nWhen the Global Conference was convened in\r\nBarbados and the Programme of Action was negotiated,\r\nfive very important international implementation directives\r\nemerged. These are contained in annex II, Chapter XV, of\r\nthe report. Today my delegation will address only one of\r\nthem — to be found in section 5 of that part of the\r\nChapter.\r\nThe report mandates the formulation of a range of\r\nindicators of economic and ecological vulnerability. These\r\nare needed for the purpose of measuring sustainable\r\ndevelopment in a way that that cannot be accomplished by\r\nthe crude gross national product (GNP) per capita device.\r\nThe GNP per capita device is neither apt nor realistic for\r\nthe purpose of measuring the economic performance of\r\nsmall States. Indeed, everyone deems it, by itself, wholly\r\ninadequate for the purpose of measuring sustainable\r\ndevelopment in any State. The GNP per capita device was\r\ndeveloped by economists from large countries, with large\r\ncountries in mind, and at a time when they could not\r\nenvision the existence of a small island State, much less the\r\napplication of such a device to so recent a phenomenon.\r\nThe GNP per capita device does not reflect the fact\r\nthat our island States are too small to provide for their\r\npopulations, at a low cost, many of the services routinely\r\nafforded to citizens of large countries. As the economists\r\nwould say, we suffer from a “diseconomy of scale”. The\r\nGNP per capita device fails to reflect our inability to\r\npenetrate markets for our embryonic manufacturing\r\nindustries, whose production levels reflect small scale. It\r\ndoes not give an adequate representation of our\r\nvulnerability. A single hurricane can set our development\r\nback 10 years or more when it destroys 50 per cent of our\r\nhousing stock, completely devastates our agriculture and\r\ndamages for a long time our precious but fragile tourism\r\nindustry. A month ago Saint Lucia, which is in the eastern\r\nCaribbean, was visited by a tropical storm, which destroyed\r\nmore than 80 per cent of its banana crop. This represented\r\nmore than half of Saint Lucia’s annual gross domestic\r\nproduct. Our proneness to natural disaster cannot be\r\ndisregarded, given the frequency and inevitability of such\r\nincidents.\r\nWe join in the expressions of condolence to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Egypt following the recent\r\nnatural disaster in that country and its horrible\r\nconsequences, including the loss of life.\r\nIn our region, even man-made and unintended\r\ncircumstances can have an impact on our economic\r\nperformance in ways that large countries can avoid.\r\nDuring the gulf war, for example — 5,000 miles away\r\nfrom the Caribbean — fear of terrorism caused many\r\npeople to cancel their travel plans. The effect on our\r\npeaceful tourist destinations was devastating. The GNP\r\nper capita device does not, and cannot, reflect that\r\nvulnerability. We decry its use because it paints an\r\ninaccurate picture of our development status. It also fails\r\nto measure the environmental costs associated with\r\nproduction, consumption and disposal in any nation. The\r\nneed for a more useful set of economic-performance\r\nindicators is surely very evident in this post-Rio world.\r\nThe Conference report recommends that\r\n“Appropriate expertise should continue to be\r\nutilized in the development, compilation and\r\nupdating of the vulnerability index.” (A/CONF.167/9,\r\npara. 114)\r\nIn this regard, the University of Malta and the University\r\nof the West Indies, among others, must be congratulated\r\nfor providing the necessary intellectual resources. The\r\nemerging vulnerability index is not intended for use as a\r\nyardstick of poverty or wealth; rather, it is intended as a\r\ndevice for measuring the lack of economic resilience\r\narising from the relative inability of a country to shelter\r\nitself from forces outside its control. It is easy to\r\nconstruct; the results are not difficult to comprehend; and\r\nit lends itself to international comparisons.\r\nToday we embrace the attempt to bring novel and\r\nimproved thinking to the development process, for by\r\nsucceeding, small island States will have contributed to\r\nthe emergence of a better world. We join, in that regard,\r\nthe statements made by the Group of 77, the delegation\r\nof Barbados on behalf of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) and the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago\r\non behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States. We are\r\nthankful to the organs and agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem for the roles they have played in implementing\r\nvarious facets of the Barbados Programme of Action.\r\nMost important, my delegation applauds and thanks\r\nthe Government and the people of Barbados for having\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nsacrificed much in order to make our island voices heard.\r\nOur efforts will come to naught if the industrialized\r\ncountries do not cease and desist from engaging in harmful\r\nproduction patterns, wasteful consumption lifestyles and\r\ndeadly disposal behaviours. Global warming and sea-level\r\nrise threaten the very existence of small island States; until\r\nour skies cease to be a dump site for harmful gases, our\r\nsmall countries will remain vulnerable and threatened.\r\nOur United Nations must uphold our right to exist free\r\nof the threat of destruction. The next 50 years will be\r\ncritical. We believe that our United Nations possesses the\r\nwill and the power to harness the forces of good for\r\nsustained development and a reversal of environmental\r\ndecline. The citizens of small island developing States wish\r\nto move from seeing the United Nations as symbol to\r\nembracing it as saviour.\r\nMr. Edwards (Marshall Islands): On behalf of the\r\npeople and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands, I would like to join with the previous statements\r\nexpressing sympathy and condolences to the Government\r\nand the people of Egypt on the natural disaster that they are\r\nexperiencing.\r\nLet me also reiterate the sentiments in regards to the\r\nelection of President Essy that were expressed on behalf of\r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands by Mr. Phillip Muller,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, in his statement in the general\r\ndebate.\r\nWe have just heard a statement on behalf of the South\r\nPacific by Australia, a statement by Trinidad and Tobago\r\nas Chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States, and a\r\nstatement by the Group of 77. My delegation fully supports\r\nthose statements. On behalf of my Government, I would\r\nalso like to pay a special tribute to the Government and the\r\npeople of Barbados for the hospitality and friendship they\r\nextended to the delegation of the Marshall Islands during\r\nthe Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States.\r\nMy delegation had high hopes and aspirations when\r\nwe set out on the road that led us to the Barbados\r\nConference. All the long hours and lengthy negotiations\r\ntested our patience, and we were glad to see that the\r\nworld’s attention would finally be focused on the small\r\nisland States. We have stated many times that we feel our\r\ngroup of countries is a much-neglected group in the United\r\nNations family of nations. To show our sincere commitment\r\nto the Rio process and its follow-up, we have implemented\r\nmany projects in the Marshall Islands aimed at sustainable\r\ndevelopment, with many more in the planning stage. It\r\nwas in that spirit that we arrived in Barbados.\r\nThe Conference itself was very fruitful in\r\nstrengthening old links and forging new relations among\r\nthe leaders of the small island States. Our leaders were\r\nfull of resolve to ensure that the partnership we had\r\nstarted upon in Rio should not be lost as we moved\r\nforward from Barbados. However, I would be less than\r\nfrank if I did not mention the chagrin that was felt at the\r\nlow turnout from the developed countries. This was after\r\nall supposed to be a conference “on” and not “of” small\r\nisland developing States.\r\nLet us look closely at one of the outcomes of\r\nBarbados — the Programme of Action and its\r\nrecommendations. On the whole, the first chapters contain\r\nmost of the requirements that my Government has\r\nenvisaged in order to reach sustainable development. We\r\nwould have preferred stronger language under the\r\ninternational action sections, but we joined in the\r\nconsensus, since funding would be a separate issue\r\nconsidered as a whole. My Government stands ready to\r\nimplement those national commitments that are not yet in\r\nplace and to work jointly with our region, as outlined by\r\nAustralia. However, we cannot pursue these goals without\r\nthe assistance of the international community. In this\r\nregard, I wish to commend those countries that have\r\nstood by the Pacific Islands and that have provided\r\nurgently needed assistance. We appreciate what has been\r\nprovided, and we shall remain grateful for such\r\nassistance.\r\nTherefore, we feel that the section of the Programme\r\nconcerning funding is totally inadequate. We may, as the\r\nrelevant paragraph says, seek to ensure that appropriate\r\nattention is given to the concerns of the small island\r\nStates by the various international institutions. The danger\r\nis that such a vague sentence will undermine our efforts\r\non the implementation level. We are grateful to those\r\nfriends who continue to support us, and my Government\r\nstrongly urges the developed countries to extend some of\r\ntheir official development assistance to the small island\r\nStates. We also support the call made by the Group of 77\r\nto ensure that the 0.7 per cent target for official\r\ndevelopment assistance is reached.\r\nOn institutional follow-up, we recognize that there\r\nshould be an identifiable unit within the Department for\r\nPolicy Coordination and Sustainable Development. This\r\noffice should have sufficient staff to be able properly to\r\ncarry out its duties and mandates. This is stated very\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nclearly in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action, and\r\nI strongly believe that we are not micro-managing the\r\nSecretary-General if we voice the opinion that there should\r\nbe at least four professional staff members dedicated to\r\nimplementing the outcomes of the Barbados Conference.\r\nWe also feel that the regional strengthening of the\r\neconomic commissions should occur at the subregional\r\nlevel wherever possible. For the Pacific, this would mean\r\nthe Pacific Operations Centre of the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific, based in Port Vila,\r\nVanuatu.\r\nWe commend the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) for the work carried out on the two\r\nfeasibility studies. In particular, we are glad to see the\r\nreport on the technical assistance programme for small\r\nisland developing States (SIDS/TAP), as we have been\r\naware, ever since we became a Member of the United\r\nNations, of shortcomings in the area of technical\r\ncooperation among developing countries. In our opinion, the\r\nSIDS/TAP programme could be implemented immediately,\r\nas the international framework required is more or less\r\nalready in place.\r\nWe also welcome the study done on the small island\r\ndeveloping States information network (SIDS/NET); it is\r\nbeing studied in great detail in our capital. There are still\r\nsome unanswered questions, but we are hopeful that we can\r\nhave a period of consultations with UNDP and donor\r\ncountries to see how this programme could be implemented.\r\nFor many small island States, SIDS/NET would entail a\r\nconsiderable investment. We need to look at this in detail\r\nthrough careful examination.\r\nThese proposals are directed at capacity-building in the\r\nsmall island States, a critical element in sustainable\r\ndevelopment. But we have to realize that a certain degree\r\nof capacity-building is required before we can get to the\r\nlevel of implementing these proposals nationally. I must\r\nadd that we are disappointed that these two reports were not\r\ntranslated and distributed at an earlier date.\r\nWe were all very much aware that the Barbados\r\nConference was an ambitious undertaking. At the same\r\ntime, we were reminded that it would be the first follow-up\r\nto Rio — in essence, a test of the international will to\r\nimplement Agenda 21. We were told by experts that the\r\nislands would be useful arenas for pilot projects because of\r\ntheir small scale and relative isolation. The cost would also\r\nbe much less — or so those experts said.\r\nOur negotiating partners had different ideas as far as\r\nthe cost was concerned. A journalist from the Pacific\r\nproposed the following headline for his final report:\r\n“North to Islands: Swim.” It seemed to him that the North\r\nwas only reaffirming existing pledges and programmes,\r\nand that the islands would have to turn to each other for\r\nassistance and advice. This has even been reiterated in a\r\nwell-known journal that often circulates in this very\r\nbuilding.\r\nThe Marshall Islands, together with the other island\r\ncountries of the Pacific region, did not come to the\r\nBarbados Conference empty-handed. Our forests,\r\natmospheres, exclusive economic zones, marine\r\necosystems and coral reefs contribute a great deal to the\r\npreservation, if not the betterment, of the overall global\r\nenvironment. We would not like to come away with less.\r\nWe know what the sustainable development needs of\r\nthe Marshall Islands are. The costs envisaged to meet\r\nthose needs are minute in comparison with the costs of\r\ngiant development projects around the world. Our requests\r\nare not extravagant.\r\nI appeal to the States Members of this Organization\r\nto look closely at the commitments freely made at Rio\r\nand to reaffirm to the members of the Alliance of Small\r\nIsland States that they will fulfil those commitments.\r\nFurthermore, I would like to invite the Member States to\r\nlook favourably on the draft resolution that will be\r\nsubmitted by the Alliance of Small Island States through\r\nthe Group of 77, and to ensure its passage and\r\nimplementation.\r\nMr. George (Federated States of Micronesia): We\r\njoin you, Mr. President, and previous speakers in\r\nexpressing our sympathy to the people and Government\r\nof Egypt on the loss of life and destruction suffered as a\r\nresult of the recent flood.\r\nThe Ambassador of Australia has spoken for all the\r\nPacific Forum countries, including the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia, on this important item — the report on and\r\noutcomes of the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held in\r\nBarbados from 26 April to 6 May 1994.\r\nAt the outset, I should like, on behalf of my\r\nGovernment, to thank the Government of Barbados for\r\nthe excellent arrangements it made, for its hospitality and\r\nfor its valuable contributions to the success of the Global\r\nConference.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nI should like also to express my Government’s\r\nappreciation to Australia’s Ambassador for the\r\nEnvironment, Penelope Anne Wensley, for the invaluable\r\nrole she played as Chairperson of the Preparatory and Main\r\nCommittees of the Barbados Conference.\r\nThe Federated States of Micronesia fully supports and\r\nassociates itself with the regional statement made by\r\nAustralia in its capacity as Chairman of the South Pacific\r\nForum. I am also happy to say that my country fully\r\nsupports the statement made by the Ambassador of Trinidad\r\nand Tobago as Chairperson of our transregional common-\r\ninterest group, the Alliance of Small Island States, to which\r\nwe attach great importance. As a member of the Group of\r\n77, we are in full agreement with the statement made by\r\nthe Ambassador of Algeria in his capacity as Chairman of\r\nour Group.\r\nIn 1992, at the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED), the world\r\ncommunity adopted Agenda 21. All the nations gathered at\r\nthat historic Conference declared that Agenda 21 reflected\r\na global consensus and political commitment at the highest\r\nlevel of cooperation on development and environment. They\r\nfurther stressed that the cooperation of all States was\r\ncrucial for the fulfilment of the objectives of Agenda 21. It\r\nis in this context that we regard the issue under\r\ndiscussion — the report and outcomes of the Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States — as a subject which is crucial to the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia.\r\nFor the first time in the history of the United Nations,\r\nwe have been able to put forward an agenda for world\r\nattention concerning the sustainable development of small\r\nisland developing States. The Barbados Conference was not\r\nonly the first global conference on sustainable development,\r\nbut also the first concrete implementation of Agenda 21.\r\nOver the past two years or so, many delegations have spent\r\ntime, effort and energy in the complex preparations and\r\nnegotiations which led to the adoption of the Programme of\r\nAction in Barbados in May 1994. Given the human,\r\ntechnical, financial and political complexities of that\r\nprocess, we all know now how great a challenge sustainable\r\ndevelopment really is. While addressing that challenge has\r\nbeen a demanding exercise for all involved, we are now\r\nembarking on yet another stage, which will require much\r\ngreater effort than before. As we all know, the\r\nimplementation stage of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\nis a tremendous task, which awaits the greatest commitment\r\nof the international community.\r\nIt is exceedingly crucial to understand that, if we fail\r\nto breathe life into the Programme of Action, all of our\r\nefforts will be futile. In Rio we all joined in pursuing a\r\nnew agenda for the twenty-first century. It is even clearer\r\nto us today that partnership participation in the sustainable\r\ndevelopment movement will require the genuine\r\ncommitment and support of the international community,\r\nespecially that of the industrialized countries.\r\nMy delegation believes that the ongoing work of the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly is\r\nexceptionally important, because, as we continue to build\r\non the achievements of previous years, the international\r\nenvironment and sustainable development agenda will\r\nneed to be tightly focused, with a common objective, in\r\nthe process leading up to the full review conference on\r\nthe overall implementation of the UNCED outcomes by\r\nthe General Assembly in 1997.\r\nThe Federated States of Micronesia became deeply\r\ninvolved in the various UNCED-related activities as its\r\npriority when it joined the United Nations at the\r\nbeginning of the forty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We believe that the journey from Rio has had\r\nmany significant milestones. One of the significant\r\nachievements is the outcome of the Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates. The Programme of Action that emerged from the\r\nGlobal Conference is the first post-Rio effort to amplify\r\nthe principles of Agenda 21 in a specific context pointing\r\ntowards tangible measures for implementation. We are\r\nnow at a stage when mechanisms have been established\r\nto give impetus to the implementation of these measures.\r\nWith such mechanisms in place as the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development, the Conventions on climate\r\nchange, desertification and biodiversity, and the\r\nrestructured Global Environment Facility (GEF), the\r\ninternational community finds itself ever more obliged to\r\ngive the highest priority to the international environment\r\nagenda. All of these mechanisms offer a unique\r\ncontribution to the collective international effort towards\r\nsustainable development in significant ways.\r\nMuch has already been done in our region to put\r\ninto effect the commitments undertaken in the Programme\r\nof Action. At the regional level, the South Pacific\r\nRegional Environment Programme (SPREP) has been\r\nactive in the coordination of a number of activities in the\r\narea of sustainable development, including a regional\r\nbiodiversity programme funded by the pilot phase of the\r\nGEF. At the national level, despite many difficulties that\r\nmy country faces as a small island State, the Federated\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nStates of Micronesia has already begun to take positive\r\nsteps towards sustainable development. As a first step, and\r\nin recognition of the importance of the Global Conference\r\non the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, my Government has created a widely representative\r\nNational Sustainable Development Board to monitor the\r\nintegration of sustainable development policies into\r\ngovernment action to assist with the analysis and\r\ncoordination of projects.\r\nWe welcome the recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on actions taken by the organs, organizations and\r\nbodies of the United Nations system to implement the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States. With particular attention to\r\nparagraphs 139 and 140 of that report, under the heading\r\n“Institutional Arrangements”, we especially call for the\r\nsupport of our developed-country partners for the creation\r\nof an identifiable entity within the United Nations\r\nDepartment for Policy Coordination and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, as called for in paragraph 123 of the\r\nProgramme of Action. Resources are required in order to\r\nhave this identifiable entity established and functioning as\r\nthe focal point within the Department to provide substantive\r\nsecretariat support, follow-up, monitoring, review and\r\ncoordination of the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction. As the identifiable entity is envisaged as reporting\r\nto the Commission on Sustainable Development and other\r\nrelevant bodies on the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction, it will ensure that the outcomes of the Barbados\r\nConference are effectively integrated into the Commission’s\r\nthematic programme of work.\r\nMy country also welcomes the cooperative and prompt\r\nefforts of the United Nations Development Programme in\r\nundertaking a feasibility study, as called for in the\r\nProgramme of Action, on an information network and a\r\ntechnical assistance programme for small island developing\r\nStates. While these feasibility studies are a valuable\r\ncontribution to giving impetus to the attainment of the\r\nobjectives and outcomes of the Barbados Conference, they\r\nshould be seen as an information and technical network to\r\nmove forward and complement the 14 substantive sectoral\r\nareas in the Programme of Action yet to be implemented.\r\nI wish to point out that it was with recognition of the\r\nspecial vulnerabilities of small island developing States on\r\nglobal environmental problems, particularly with respect to\r\nclimate change, biological diversity and international\r\nwaters, that the Programme of Action specifically requested\r\nthat the restructured GEF should be seen as an important\r\nchannel of assistance in these areas, through the provision\r\nof new and additional resources. At the meeting of Heads\r\nof State of members of the South Pacific Forum, which\r\nwas held in Brisbane, Australia, the Forum welcomed the\r\nrestructuring and replenishment of the GEF and its\r\nintention to assist in the outcomes of the Barbados\r\nConference.\r\nWe are not only the inhabitants of this planet, but\r\nalso custodians of the shared resources which will be\r\nessential to the survival of future generations. It is in this\r\nlight that we call for a strong partnership, to be seen not\r\nalong lines of developed countries versus developing\r\ncountries, but, rather, as a shared goal and investment for\r\nthe benefit of the entire family of nations. As the\r\nProgramme of Action clearly sets out the actions to be\r\nimplemented at the international, regional and national\r\nlevels, my country urges all Member States to support\r\nduring the remainder of the forty-ninth session the overall\r\noutcome of the Barbados Conference, including all the\r\nenabling resolutions, which will give the specialized\r\nUnited Nations agencies and organizations the mandate to\r\nstart implementing the substance of the Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nMr. Samana (Papua New Guinea): My delegation\r\nfully endorses and associates itself with the statements\r\nmade by the Chairpersons of the Group of 77, the\r\nAlliance of Small Island States and the South Pacific\r\nForum, who have eloquently expressed and conveyed the\r\nsignificance and the importance of the Global Conference\r\non the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States.\r\nWe believe that the Barbados Conference was a\r\nmajor historical milestone which provided the impetus to\r\nthe international community to demonstrate its\r\ncommitment to the promise of Rio in 1992. It also offered\r\na positive opportunity for greater participation and\r\ninvolvement by the international community in the\r\nimportant areas and issues of common interest and\r\nconcern to mankind.\r\nPapua New Guinea maintains and shares the view\r\nthat the sustainable development of small island\r\ndeveloping States and their survival depend critically on\r\nthe cooperation of the international community for the full\r\nand immediate implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nPapua New Guinea is already in the process of\r\nintroducing appropriate policies and legislative measures\r\nto give added substance to the Programme of Action and\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nthe realization of the overall goals and objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment.\r\nIt has been realized, by many at the national and\r\ninternational levels, that the indiscriminate depletion of\r\nnatural resources, and its adverse effects on the global\r\nenvironment and subsequent effects on climate change,\r\npollution, rises in the sea- level and environmental\r\ndegradation, is becoming critical, imposing serious\r\nlimitations particularly on the development and the very\r\nexistence and sustenance of small island developing States.\r\nThe small island developing States possess within their\r\nnational and regional surroundings natural habitats that\r\nhouse unique species of flora and fauna.\r\nThe international community’s recognition of the\r\nimportant role of small island developing States as\r\ncustodians of valuable biodiversity is not only timely but\r\nindeed a positive step towards creating a greater opportunity\r\nfor the attainment of sustainable development for the\r\nbenefit of all our citizens.\r\nAt the Barbados Conference, a strong political\r\nmessage was sent to the world by the participation of our\r\nGovernor-General, Sir Wiwa Korowi who, among others,\r\nchallenged the international community to provide the\r\nnecessary resources to implement not only the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action but also the overall outcome of the\r\nRio process.\r\nPapua New Guinea is of the firm view that the success\r\nof the Barbados Conference, like all other United Nations\r\nconferences, largely depends on the willingness of the\r\ndonor countries to provide adequate technical and financial\r\nresources to ensure its full implementation.\r\nThe Programme of Action highlights a number of\r\ndevelopment strategies which are important in promoting\r\nsustainable development. More specifically, these strategies\r\ninclude, human resource development, institutional capacity-\r\nbuilding, and the promotion of international cooperation in\r\nthe transfer of technology, trade and investments.\r\nOur existing foreign and domestic policies are geared\r\ntowards achieving sustainable development, through the\r\napplication of sound management practices in the\r\nexploitation of natural resources. This is done through the\r\nestablishment, since independence, of environmental\r\nplanning and protection legislation that sets legal\r\nmechanisms for the monitoring of environmental pollutants,\r\nagainst required levels, and effectively polices the\r\nactivities of industry in terms of adherence to national\r\nenvironmental planning guidelines. This legislation sets\r\nlimits, for instance, in the case of forest resources and\r\nparameters for sustainable harvesting.\r\nThe direct involvement of the international\r\ncommunity as well as relevant United Nations specialized\r\nagencies is needed in order effectively to fulfil the various\r\nprogramme requirements and directly to support national\r\nand regional efforts and priorities. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the actions that have already been taken through\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),\r\nparticularly the Feasibility Study on a Technical\r\nAssistance Programme for Small Island Developing\r\nStates, including two subregional workshops held in Fiji\r\nand Barbados.\r\nWe are also pleased to acknowledge a joint initiative\r\nof the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements\r\n(HABITAT), UNDP and the World Bank on an urban\r\nmanagement and environmental sanitation programme in\r\na number of South Pacific island countries.\r\nAt the regional level, a number of programmes have\r\nbeen initiated, complementing the international\r\nProgramme of Action and including: the promotion of\r\ncoastal area management; the efficient use of energy\r\nresources; increased participation in global research,\r\nassessment, the monitoring and mapping of climate\r\nimpacts; the provision of technical assistance; the\r\nstrengthening of disaster preparedness and institutional\r\nmanagement; and the establishment of mechanisms to\r\nrestrict the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes;\r\nand the monitoring of marine pollution.\r\nPapua New Guinea has initiated a move towards the\r\nestablishment of a regional convention on the prevention\r\nof the transboundary movement of hazardous and toxic\r\nwastes, which is now in its final negotiating stages and is\r\nexpected to come into force in 1995. This, we believe, is\r\na major step towards the overall management and\r\nprotection of our environment.\r\nPapua New Guinea has also embarked on an\r\ninter-island transportation project and has removed trade\r\nand migration barriers, with some members of the South\r\nPacific Forum, to be consistent with the international\r\nconsensus on the promotion of equitable trade and\r\ninvestment to achieve sustained economic growth and\r\nsustainable development.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nPapua New Guinea is particularly vulnerable to\r\npotential environmental degradation, in the sense that\r\n60 per cent of its revenues come from the exportation of\r\nmining and petroleum resources, including forest and\r\nfisheries resources. Ironically, therefore, these industries\r\nrequire the greatest attention and need to be monitored\r\nclosely for any potential adverse effects and environmental\r\ndegradation.\r\nThe National Government and UNDP is creating a\r\nNational Sustainable Development Strategy which,\r\ninter alia, will oversee the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nWe therefore believe that the international community,\r\nworking through and with the regional and subregional\r\norganizational mechanisms, can effectively implement the\r\nProgramme of Action that will further strengthen and\r\nenhance international development cooperation in pursuit of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe look forward to the report of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development on the implementation of the\r\nProgramme at the next session, when we will continue to\r\nmake constructive contributions to the work of the\r\nCommission. Thus, we would encourage the various\r\nagencies, including the Inter-Agency Committee on\r\nSustainable Development, to give greater consideration to\r\nthe implementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nThe success of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\ncritically hinges on the positive support of the international\r\ncommunity in the effective implementation of national and\r\nregional programmes.\r\nPapua New Guinea looks forward, with a greater sense\r\nof confidence in our endeavour, to the realization of the\r\ngoals of sustainable development pertaining to the particular\r\nneeds and aspirations of the small island developing States\r\nas a prerequisite in developing the national and regional\r\ncapacity to contribute effectively in our global partnership\r\nto ensure a better future for our children.\r\nMr. Maruyama (Japan): At the outset, my delegation\r\nwould like to join previous speakers in expressing its\r\ndeepest sympathy to the Government and the people of\r\nEgypt on the tragic loss incurred as a result of the recent\r\nflood.\r\nMy delegation would like to congratulate the\r\nGovernment of Barbados for having successfully convened\r\nthe Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States, in response to the\r\nchallenge we set for ourselves at the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development in 1992,\r\nand to thank those who devoted so much time and effort\r\nto preparing for it. The Programme of Action and the\r\nBarbados Declaration adopted at the Conference are\r\nindeed landmarks on the road from Rio. They provide\r\nfresh impetus to the work of the international community\r\non the sustainable development of small island developing\r\nStates.\r\nIt was a historic conference, in as much as it\r\nestablished a firm basis for directing the attention of the\r\ninternational community to small island developing States\r\nand the serious problems they face in achieving\r\nsustainable development. The Programme of Action is the\r\nfirst step taken by the international community to help\r\nthem address those problems. Our next task is to ensure\r\nits implementation on the basis of the partnership created\r\nat the Conference. The Government of Japan, for its part,\r\nwill be guided by the Programme of Action and by the\r\nspirit of the Declaration of Barbados in the delivery of\r\nbilateral and multilateral development assistance to small\r\nisland developing States.\r\nThe Programme of Action emphasizes the\r\nimportance of human resource development to the\r\nsustainable development of small island developing States\r\nand pinpoints specific issues such as education, training\r\nand research and development as being of particular\r\nsignificance. It also rightly emphasizes the importance of\r\nenhancing institutional and administrative capacity. This\r\nis an orientation that is in accord with the policy of Japan\r\nwith respect to its development assistance to developing\r\ncountries, one of whose major priorities is enhancement\r\nof self-reliance. There is a synergy that is produced when\r\neffective national efforts are supported by external\r\nassistance. Japan is determined to work to enhance that\r\nsynergy.\r\nMy delegation would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on action taken by the\r\norgans, organizations and bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem to implement the Programme of Action, and also\r\nfor his notes transmitting the studies undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on the\r\nfeasibility of developing a Small Island Developing States\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\ntechnical assistance programme (SIDS/TAP) and a Small\r\nIsland Developing States information network (SIDS/NET).\r\nAs the Secretary-General rightly points out, the report\r\nshould be considered to be of an interim nature. In view of\r\nthe important role of the United Nations system, my\r\ndelegation believes that it is vital to conduct a continuing\r\nreview of plans and programmes for implementing the\r\nProgramme of Action, and it therefore looks forward to\r\nfurther reports. In that connection, it would welcome the\r\nreview of the Programme of Action by the Inter-agency\r\nCommittee on Sustainable Development suggested in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report.\r\nMy delegation particularly welcomes and supports the\r\nresults of the studies undertaken by UNDP on the\r\nSIDS/TAP technical assistance programme and the\r\nSIDS/NET information network. Cooperation is of vital\r\nimportance in enhancing self-reliance by small island\r\ndeveloping States, and both SIDS/TAP and SIDS/NET are\r\ndesigned to strengthen such cooperation. This, too, is a goal\r\nthat is in line with the policy of Japan, which attaches\r\nimportance to South-South cooperation in strengthening\r\ninternational cooperation for development.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to assure you,\r\nMr. President, that Japan will make every effort to play an\r\nactive role in implementing the decisions reached at the\r\nhistoric first Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.\r\nMr. Balzan (Malta): I join previous speakers in\r\nexpressing deepest sympathy and solidarity with the\r\nGovernment and the people of Egypt at this trying time, as\r\nthey deal with the tragic consequences of the recent floods.\r\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, which was\r\nconvened in Barbados earlier this year, marked the first\r\nconcrete measure emanating from the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, held in Rio\r\nde Janeiro in June 1992. The Barbados Conference\r\nsuccessfully accomplished its task. It specified relevant\r\npolicies within a framework of a Programme of Action\r\naimed at enabling small island developing States to achieve\r\nsustainable development.\r\nUnquestionably, credit must be given to the\r\nGovernment of Barbados for the excellent organization and\r\nto the people of Barbados for the cordial hospitality\r\nextended to delegations. Our gratitude goes also to Prime\r\nMinister Sandiford for the able and skilful manner in\r\nwhich he steered the Conference to a successful conclusion.\r\nThe delegation of Malta views the current debate on\r\nthe report of the Barbados Conference as a manifestation\r\nof the importance the international community attaches to\r\nthe well-being of small island developing States. My\r\nGovernment welcomes the report (A/49/425) of the\r\nSecretary General, on the action taken by the organs,\r\norganizations and bodies of the United Nations system to\r\nimplement the Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.\r\nWhile affirming the human and natural assets\r\npertaining to small island developing States, the\r\nDeclaration of Barbados did not fail to highlight the\r\nhurdles that need to be overcome. In aiming at the\r\nattainment of a better quality of life for present and future\r\ngenerations, the document adopts an exemplary wide-\r\nranging approach.\r\nComprehensive as it is, the Programme of Action\r\nnegotiated and agreed upon at Bridgetown addresses\r\ninnumerable issues relating to the sustainable development\r\nof small island States, issues which have been repeatedly\r\nunderscored and which have been universally recognized.\r\nIn 1992, in Rio, the international community identified\r\nthe particular problems faced by small island States as a\r\nspecial case with regard both to environment and to\r\ndevelopment. If not catered for, their size, geographic\r\nlocation and limited resources could constitute particular\r\nvulnerabilities.\r\nAt times, the size and geographic location of States\r\nin this category impose in themselves a number of\r\neconomic disadvantages. In some cases, these\r\ndisadvantages are multiplied as a consequence of natural\r\ndisasters. In fact, vulnerability to external economic\r\ninfluences and ecological fragility are major concerns for\r\nsmall island developing States.\r\nA reality at times overlooked was pointed out by the\r\nGovernor-General of Barbados, Her Excellency\r\nDame Nita Barrow, in her address to the Conference in\r\nBarbados, namely, that one sixth of the Earth’s surface,\r\nincluding a significant portion of its marine and\r\nbiodiversity resources, falls under the jurisdiction of small\r\nisland States. This element is noted, more than as a matter\r\nof pride, because one cannot ignore its inherent\r\nimplications or its impact on the world community as a\r\nwhole.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nSmall island States are fully aware of their problems,\r\nbut likewise cognizant of their responsibilities,\r\nresponsibilities that, if shared, could be better addressed and\r\nmore easily resolved. Hence the need to encourage and\r\nenhance regional and international cooperation.\r\nHistory teaches us that small island States, in their\r\neffort to survive, have always invested in their human\r\nresources. This is one investment which has never failed.\r\nOn the contrary, it has consistently yielded high dividends.\r\nMalta, itself a small island State, is living proof that\r\nthe best investment lies in the development of human\r\nresources. Innovative and traditional economic activities\r\nthat have been undertaken have given our islands the\r\nimpetus needed to put the economy on a sound platform.\r\nSmall island States, notwithstanding their diverse\r\ncharacteristics, have always played an important role in the\r\nmultilateral process. Through their experience, gained in the\r\ncourse of their long history, they can continue to contribute\r\nto enhancing international political and economic\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe Convention on the Law of the Sea, which will\r\nsoon enter into force, and the proposal to include climate\r\nchange as an item on the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly — both launched by Malta — are two examples\r\nof the manner in which a State, regardless of its size, can\r\ncontribute to the well-being of mankind.\r\nIn this context, my country welcomes the inclusion in\r\nthe Programme of Action of its proposal to set up a\r\nvulnerability index to serve as a supplementary yardstick to\r\nmeasure the degree and extent of vulnerabilities in terms\r\nboth of economic structures and of institutions.\r\nA main agenda item currently being discussed within\r\nthe Organization is the issue of development. Endless\r\ndiscussions at different levels have identified the basic\r\nelements necessary for socio-economic sustainability. The\r\nAssembly is expected shortly to debate the measures\r\nessential for the enhancement of development. The\r\nrequirements and concerns of the category of small island\r\nStates should not be sidelined.\r\nBarbados does not mark the end of an exercise; rather,\r\nit signals the commencement of an ongoing process which\r\nmonitors and ensures that the results obtained are\r\nconsolidated and augmented.\r\nTraditional wisdom teaches us that a problem shared\r\nis a problem halved.\r\nAs my delegation pointed out in Barbados, the\r\ninvolvement and assistance of the international\r\ncommunity in resolving issues which may hinder or arrest\r\nthe sustainable development of small island developing\r\nStates have to be viewed from a much wider perspective.\r\nThat wider perspective necessarily includes the inverse\r\nproportionality of the importance which small island\r\nStates have in key strategic areas of the globe. Conscious\r\nas they are of the responsibilities and hardships which\r\ntheir sensitive location has often placed on them, small\r\nisland States are in the forefront in championing dialogue\r\nas the unique tool for fostering greater harmony and\r\ncoexistence.\r\nDialogue is at the root of any approach to the\r\nresolution of problems. Dialogue helps identify problems\r\nand stimulates solutions. Dialogue re-cements what\r\nconflicts often undo. In so doing dialogue demands as its\r\nbasic element solidarity in action — solidarity which\r\nwarrants a comprehensive approach; solidarity which\r\nshould not be limited to mere words but should serve as\r\nthe means to translate words into deeds.\r\nMr. Pierre (Guyana): I wish first to extend\r\ncondolences to the Government and people of Egypt on\r\nthe recent occurrences that have resulted in the tragic loss\r\nof life and suffering in that country.\r\nMy delegation is happy to register its concurrence\r\nwith the statements delivered by the delegation of\r\nBarbados on behalf of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) and the delegation of Algeria on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77.\r\nThe Rio Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment gave the world perhaps its clearest signal\r\nyet that the problems confronting humanity are so grave\r\nand urgent that they require treatment at the highest level\r\npossible. That Summit was equally unequivocal in its\r\nemphasis on the unique nature and vulnerability of small\r\nisland States and of low-lying coastal regions.\r\nThe situation confronting small island developing\r\nStates in an increasingly competitive global economic and\r\npolitical environment is very aptly depicted in chapter 17\r\nof Agenda 21. Small island States are indeed a special\r\ncase both for environment and for development. They are\r\necologically fragile and vulnerable. Their small size,\r\nlimited resources, geographical dispersion and isolation\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nfrom markets place them at a grave disadvantage\r\neconomically and prevent the realization of any benefits of\r\neconomies of scale.\r\nIn Barbados in April this year we met and deliberated\r\nsuccessfully on the special circumstances affecting this\r\ngroup of partners. That occasion marked the first major\r\nsubstantive follow-up process to the Rio Conference and\r\nwas unique for this and for its focus on a specific and\r\nimportant concern. Our task henceforth will be to pursue\r\nwith equal vigour and enthusiasm the full and urgent\r\nimplementation of the agreements and decisions reached at\r\nthat Conference. Guyana joins in urging the full\r\nendorsement of the Barbados Declaration and the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States, contained in document\r\nA/CONF.167/9, now before the Assembly for consideration.\r\nImportant as they are, those agreements will amount\r\nto very little unless appropriate mechanisms are established\r\nfor effective monitoring and implementation of actions on\r\na system-wide basis. To this end, we believe that it is\r\nessential that this responsibility be appropriately located\r\nwithin the Department for Policy Coordination and\r\nSustainable Development, as provided for in the Programme\r\nof Action. That Department should therefore be adequately\r\nequipped for the proper fulfilment of its responsibility for\r\nmonitoring and coordination and for the provision of an\r\neffective support structure for the follow-up to the\r\nConference decisions.\r\nTwo areas of critical importance to small island States\r\nare information technology and capacity-building that would\r\nenhance the capacity of those States to better utilize and\r\nharness the assets of their rich natural habitat. In this\r\nconnection, the proposals for projects in the small islands\r\ndeveloping States information network (SIDS/NET) and the\r\nsmall islands developing States technical assistance\r\nprogramme (SIDS/TAP) set forth a full scope of work. The\r\nefficient and prompt manner in which the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) has responded to a\r\nmandate given it to prepare studies on these proposals\r\ndeserves our full commendation.\r\nThose studies are contained in additional reports also\r\nbefore us for approval. Two noteworthy features of the\r\nprojects need to be underscored: the emphasis placed on\r\nlocal capacity-building, and the utilization of indigenous\r\nknowledge. I urge the Assembly to endorse the report now\r\nbefore us and to give its full support to the action outlined\r\ntherein.\r\nThe extensive preparatory process in which we were\r\nall engaged and the exemplary deliberations in the\r\nConference itself and in its other processes, such as the\r\nmeeting of the Group of Eminent Persons and the Forum\r\nof the Non-Governmental Organization, all converged into\r\nthe highly successful outcome of which we now speak.\r\nOur highest commendations must go to the Government\r\nof Barbados and to the Alliance of Small Island States\r\n(AOSIS) for their roles and efforts in ensuring such an\r\noutcome. It now behooves us in the General Assembly to\r\ntreat the implementation and follow-up process with equal\r\nseriousness and determination, in order to give true\r\nmeaning to what has been accomplished.\r\nMr. Turnquest (Bahamas): Let me at the outset\r\nassociate myself with other speakers in expressing to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Egypt the condolences and\r\nsympathy of my delegation on the tragic loss of life and\r\ndamage resulting from the recent floods.\r\nThe Bahamas associates itself with the\r\ncommendations made by other delegations concerning the\r\nsuccessful outcome of the first-ever Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, held earlier this year in Barbados. The\r\nGovernment of Barbados is to be congratulated for the\r\nexcellent arrangements made for the Conference and for\r\nthe care taken of delegations attending the meeting.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to endorse the comments\r\nmade by the representative of Algeria on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77, and by the representative of Trinidad and\r\nTobago on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States\r\n(AOSIS) on this important item. We also fully associate\r\nourselves with the statement made on behalf of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) by the representative\r\nof Barbados.\r\nThe Assembly has before it for its consideration the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States, as well as the Barbados\r\nDeclaration. The Bahamas considers that the Programme\r\nof Action provides a blueprint for a comprehensive and\r\nintegrated approach to sustainable development by small\r\nisland developing States. It tackles the numerous issues\r\nthat we as island developing States must address in our\r\npursuit of sustainable development. The Declaration is a\r\nstatement of our collective political will. It is really the\r\nreaffirmation of the commitments which were made in\r\nRio. The international community is called upon to fully\r\nsupport and provide the effective means for the\r\nimplementation of this Programme.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nWhile we view the Programme of Action as an\r\nexcellent blueprint for focusing our efforts and\r\ncommitments towards the sustainable development of small\r\nisland developing States, it is recognized that the successful\r\nimplementation of the Programme will need the full support\r\nof the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment within the United Nations. We view the\r\nSecretariat support unit as a vital component of the\r\nimplementation strategy. In this regard, the necessary\r\nresources must be provided to the Secretariat in order that\r\nit may fulfil the functions outlined in paragraph 123 of the\r\nProgramme.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, and is indeed pleased with the initial\r\nefforts of the various development agencies of the United\r\nNations system in including the Programme of Action in\r\ntheir respective work programmes. More importantly, it is\r\nnoted that certain agencies have actually commenced\r\nactivities which fulfil various aspects of the Programme of\r\nAction. In this regard, we commend the World\r\nMeteorological Organization for its activities and\r\nprogrammes in several substantive areas of the Programme\r\nof Action, particularly its specific programmes for climate\r\nchange and sea-level rise, which represent a major concern\r\nfor island States like my own.\r\nThe Commission for Sustainable Development has a\r\nmandate to review the implementation of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action within the context of its multi-year\r\nthematic programme of work. We are aware that due to\r\ntime constraints, very little work was accomplished in the\r\nprevious session. We are, however, hopeful that there will\r\nbe an effective means for monitoring and reviewing the\r\nprogress made in the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction. We assure the Assembly that, as a newly elected\r\nmember of the Commission on Sustainable Development,\r\nwe are committed to play our role in the work of that\r\nCommission.\r\nIn this connection, I am pleased to report that the\r\nBahamas is in the process of establishing a national\r\ncommission on science, technology and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. It is expected that the commission will be\r\nheaded by an executive director and will be responsible for\r\nthe follow-up of Agenda 21, the two Conventions arising\r\nfrom the United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment and the Barbados Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action. The membership of the commission will reflect\r\na wide cross-section of the Bahamian community, including\r\nGovernment officials, academics, the church, business and\r\nindustrial interests and non-governmental organizations.\r\nMy delegation is indeed pleased and encouraged to\r\nnote the prompt response by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) to the mandates given\r\nto it at Barbados in paragraphs 105, 106 and 126 of the\r\nProgramme of Action to support capacity-building in\r\nsmall island developing States. With regard to paragraph\r\n105, the UNDP was directed to coordinate a feasibility\r\nstudy in collaboration with the small island developing\r\nStates and relevant subregional organizations for the\r\nimplementation of a small island developing States\r\ninformation network (SIDS/NET). However, while we\r\nview SIDS/NET as a means of enhancing human\r\nnetworking, which equips small island developing States\r\nwith the capacity to respond to the priorities of the\r\nProgramme of Action, it will be effective only if its\r\ninformation component is one in which we, as island\r\ndeveloping States, are the primary generators of\r\ninformation for the network.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme was\r\nalso mandated, under paragraph 106 of the Programme of\r\nAction, to coordinate a feasibility study on a technical\r\nassistance programme for small island developing States\r\n(SIDS/TAP). This directive has been ably fulfilled by\r\nUNDP, as reported by the Secretary-General in document\r\nA/49/459. My Government is currently studying this\r\nreport with great interest. We are pleased with the manner\r\nin which the study was conducted, that is, that there was\r\nclose cooperation with the AOSIS core group of States,\r\nregional institutions, non-governmental organizations and\r\nthe island States themselves. The Bahamas notes, too, the\r\ncommitment by SIDS/TAP to involve as much as possible\r\nexperts from small island developing countries.\r\nThe Bahamas wishes to raise one small concern,\r\nhowever, and that is that it be treated fully as a small\r\nisland developing State. The existence of a relatively\r\nelevated gross national product per capita ought not to\r\noperate in the Programme as a bar to equal treatment. I\r\ntake this opportunity to mention this point, as it ought to\r\nbe borne in mind that several island developing States\r\nhave now graduated from UNDP assistance as well as\r\nfrom concessional treatment by most other international\r\nfinancial institutions. We see this mechanism, therefore,\r\nas one where the excluding criteria would not be applied.\r\nSmall island developing States are noted for their\r\nspecies diversity and endemism. However, due to their\r\nsmall size, their relative isolation and the fragility of\r\nisland ecosystems, their biological diversity is among the\r\nmost threatened in the world. We take this opportunity to\r\nnote that the Barbados Programme of Action contains\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nagreement on action to formulate and implement integrated\r\nstrategies for the conservation and sustainable use of such\r\nterritorial and marine biodiversity, and in particular of\r\nendemic species.\r\nIn this regard, we commend the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) for taking the leadership\r\nwithin the United Nations system in forging a new\r\nrelationship between the United Nations agencies, a global\r\npartnership to respond to current and future needs of\r\nMember States in such areas as climate change and species\r\nprotection. We are pleased to note that UNEP will be\r\nconvening the first conference of the parties to the\r\nbiodiversity Convention in the Bahamas from 28 November\r\nto 9 December 1994. We are confident that the outcome of\r\nthat Conference will continue to focus the attention of the\r\ninternational community on small island developing States\r\nand their special needs and circumstances.\r\nAlthough it is recognized that financing for the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action must come\r\nprimarily from national public and private sources within\r\nthe small island developing States, it has also been\r\nrecognized that implementation of the Programme of Action\r\nwill require the provision of adequate, predictable, new\r\nadditional financial resources. In this connection, we take\r\nthe opportunity to urge the international community once\r\nagain to honour the financial commitments made and to\r\nreview our first full-fledged test of global partnership\r\nforged at Rio, by which the international community made\r\nfirm commitments to work collectively to guarantee\r\nsustainable development. Fulfilling pledged commitments\r\nwill certainly enable small island developing States to make\r\noperational the blueprint of the Programme of Action of the\r\nBarbados Conference.\r\nMr. Shambos (Cyprus): I should like to join you,\r\nMr. President, and previous speakers in expressing\r\nprofound condolences and sympathy to the Government and\r\npeople of Egypt for the tragic loss in human lives and\r\nproperty caused by the wrath of nature.\r\nSmall island developing States, a unique and valuable\r\ncomponent of our global environmental and developmental\r\nundertakings, have finally achieved their due recognition by\r\nattaining their rightful place on our agenda.\r\nThe culmination of this recognition was the convening\r\nof the Barbados Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held at\r\nBridgetown from 25 April to 6 May of this year. My\r\nGovernment expresses appreciation to the Government and\r\npeople of Barbados for the excellent conference\r\narrangements, which led to the successful conclusion of\r\nthat historic gathering, and for the warm hospitality\r\nextended to all participants.\r\nThe Barbados Conference itself can undoubtedly be\r\ncharacterized as a success. Its Programme of Action and\r\nthe Barbados Declaration delineate the commitments of\r\nmankind to the survival and progress of this vulnerable\r\nand vital component of our globe’s delicate and complex\r\necological and developmental balance.\r\nThe convening of the Conference is to a great extent\r\nan achievement that should be attributed to the dedication\r\nand persistent adherence of the Alliance of Small Island\r\nStates (AOSIS) to the cause of the special environmental\r\nand developmental needs of small island States.\r\nThe Republic of Cyprus, itself a member of AOSIS,\r\nembraced at an early stage the just cause of this\r\npioneering exercise and will continue to work for the\r\nrealization and furtherance of its goals.\r\nWith regard to the activities of AOSIS, special\r\nrecognition is due its current Chairman, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Trinidad and Tobago, Ambassador\r\nAnnette des Isles, and all the staff of her mission, as well\r\nas to her predecessor, the former Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Vanuatu, Robert Van Lierop, the\r\nspiritual father of AOSIS, whose personal vision and\r\nextraordinary dedication to the goals set have made\r\ntoday’s achievements an attainable reality.\r\nThe Barbados AOSIS Summit and its Communiqué,\r\nwhich was unanimously adopted, highlight the moral\r\ndimensions of this exercise and prescribe the political\r\nmessages small island States are sending to the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Barbados Conference indeed marked a milestone\r\nin our history by honouring with commitments the\r\npromises of Rio to one of the most vulnerable groups of\r\nour community of States.\r\nHowever, recognition and awareness alone will not\r\nsuffice to cure the acute problems small island developing\r\nStates are facing today. The degradation of their\r\nenvironment, their vulnerability to the adverse effects of\r\nhuman-induced climate change, the rise in sea level and\r\nsubsequent submersion of their territories, the imminent\r\nthreats to their unique ecosystems and biodiversity\r\ncontributions all emerge as urgent issues of great concern.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nTheir primarily single-product markets, their small size and\r\ntheir remoteness from commercial, trade and technological\r\ncentres, the fragility and small scale of their economies,\r\ntheir lack of adequate endogenous capacity for independent\r\nsustainable development, the vulnerability of their cultures\r\nand of their security and their exposure to pollution and\r\nnatural disasters all aggravate the overall challenges\r\nconfronting small island developing States. These and a\r\nhost of other issues are of vital significance and of\r\nuniversal dimension, and call for concerted, effective\r\naction if we aspire to succeed in the global effort to save\r\nour threatened integrated environment and to achieve\r\nsustainable development for every part of our planet.\r\nThe international community agonizes over the\r\nindifference displayed about growing, crucial environmental\r\nand developmental problems and is focusing its attention on\r\nthe implementation of the Barbados commitments and\r\ndemanding concerted global action to ensure sustainable\r\ndevelopment in small island States that would serve not\r\nonly island interests but vital global interests as well. Being\r\nat the centre of the international expectations in this regard,\r\nwe should respond to the high aspirations of our peoples\r\nwith the political determination to take concrete and\r\ncoordinated action to eliminate the ecological and economic\r\nvulnerabilities of small islands and cement their significant\r\ncontribution to the world’s fragile environmental balance.\r\nThis objective is of paramount importance and is fully\r\nsupported by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus,\r\nwhich has endorsed the principles of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the decisions taken in Barbados.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the “Action taken by the organs,\r\norganizations and bodies of the United Nations system to\r\nimplement the Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States”\r\n(A/49/425). We also welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nsubmission of the feasibility study of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) on an information-\r\nsharing network for small island States; Cyprus was used\r\nas one of the case studies in accomplishing this task. We\r\nconsider both the report and the submission of the study as\r\nsignificant steps in the right direction. The preservation and\r\nenhancement of what has been achieved so far in this vital\r\narea depend on our readiness to strictly fulfil the\r\nresponsibilities and duties emanating from the Barbados\r\ndocuments.\r\nI conclude with the plea that developing and\r\ndeveloped countries work together to fulfil our obligations\r\nto present and future generations so that this globe, our\r\ncommon home, is not only preserved but also ameliorated\r\nin order to secure the continuity of life itself. It is in this\r\njust endeavour that the small island States could and\r\nshould play a leading role. Let us all act collectively to\r\nensure the survival of humankind in an environment\r\nconducive to human dignity and prosperity all over the\r\nglobe.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil): I wish first of all to\r\nconvey to the Government and the people of Egypt\r\nBrazil’s heartfelt condolences on the tragic events in that\r\ncountry a few days ago.\r\nMy delegation would like to express its gratitude to\r\nthe people and the Government of Barbados for its\r\ngracious hospitality last April during the Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States. In particular, my delegation\r\nwould like to express its gratitude to His Excellency\r\nMr. Erskine Sandiford, former Prime Minister of\r\nBarbados, President of the Conference, and Ambassador\r\nPenelope Wensley, whose guidance of the work of the\r\nMain Committee of the Conference was fundamental to\r\nthe importance and scope of the decisions taken in\r\nBarbados.\r\nIn June 1992 Brazil had the honour to host the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment (UNCED). On that occasion, in Rio, the\r\nlinks between legitimate development goals,\r\nenvironmental concerns and the well-being of future\r\ngenerations were thoroughly established and developed.\r\nThe Global Conference on Sustainable Development\r\nof Small Island States, which emanated from the\r\ndecisions taken at UNCED, undoubtedly represented a\r\nstep ahead and a most significant milestone in the process\r\nof mobilizing international efforts towards sustainable\r\ndevelopment. It was encouraging to note that the\r\nConference in Bridgetown went beyond examining\r\ngeneral questions related to sustainable development by\r\nadding original input to specific concerns that affect small\r\nisland States.\r\nThe characteristics of small island States and their\r\nsusceptible ecosystems have made us recognize their great\r\nsignificance to our planet. Although those States are\r\nafflicted by economic difficulties and confronted by\r\ndevelopment imperatives similar to those of developing\r\ncountries in general, small island developing States have\r\ntheir own peculiar vulnerabilities and characteristics, and\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nthe difficulties they face in the pursuit of sustainable\r\ndevelopment are particularly severe and complex.\r\nBrazil is well aware of this uniqueness and considers\r\nthat small island developing States represent a special case\r\nfor sustainable development, worthy of concerted\r\ninternational attention. The potential of the small island\r\ndeveloping States has been recognized. Nevertheless, they\r\nare still faced with the challenge of ensuring that their\r\nresources are used in a sustainable way for the well-being\r\nof present and future generations.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation looks forward to the full\r\nimplementation of both Agenda 21 and the Programme of\r\nAction formulated in Barbados. We consider that the\r\nProgramme of Action represents a basis for action in the\r\nagreed priority areas and defines a number of measures and\r\npolicies related to environmental and development planning\r\nthat have to be undertaken by small island developing\r\nStates with the cooperation and assistance of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMoreover, the Programme of Action outlines the\r\ninternational community’s role in providing access to\r\nadequate, predictable and additional financial resources, in\r\noptimizing the use of existing resources and mechanisms\r\nand in adopting measures to support endogenous capacity-\r\nbuilding, specifically for the promotion of the access of\r\nsmall island developing States to environmentally sound\r\nmechanisms and technology. The Alliance of Small Island\r\nStates should be warmly congratulated on the important\r\nachievements of Bridgetown.\r\nIn establishing the basis for a new global partnership\r\nfor sustainable development, States have acknowledged\r\ntheir common but differentiated responsibilities in respect\r\nof global environmental degradation, so that the most\r\nenvironmentally vulnerable will be given priority. The\r\ninternational community therefore has to meet the\r\nobligations taken on in Barbados towards small island\r\ndeveloping States, for they are the most vulnerable among\r\nus and could very well be the first to bear the negative\r\nenvironmental impact of ill-conceived development.\r\nUnfortunately, the international community is\r\napparently still reluctant to meet its financial obligations.\r\nLess than 10 per cent of the funding for environment-\r\nrelated programmes and projects agreed on at UNCED has\r\nbeen forthcoming. The financial level at which the Global\r\nEnvironment Facility has been renegotiated is equally\r\ndiscouraging.\r\nMy delegation believes that providing small island\r\ndeveloping States with the required material support is\r\none of the most important means to enable these countries\r\nto achieve greater self-reliance in coping with\r\nenvironmental matters. It is in this context that we call\r\nupon delegations to foster financial support for projects\r\nand programmes relating to sustainable development. We\r\nunderstand that the implementation of these projects and\r\nprogrammes is a responsibility of the countries directly\r\nconcerned. Nevertheless, the support of the developed\r\ncountries, United Nations bodies and specialized\r\nintergovernmental agencies is of the utmost importance.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation welcomes the study\r\nentitled “A Feasibility Study on a Technical Assistance\r\nProgramme for Small Island Developing States”\r\n(A/49/459, Annex). This document outlines a viable\r\nfacility to support technical cooperation between small\r\nisland developing States. We are confident that similar\r\nstudies will be prepared so that effective action can be\r\ntaken with a view to implementing the decisions\r\ncontained in the Programme of Action. My delegation\r\nfully subscribes to the recommendations contained in the\r\nstudy — especially those regarding the need for the\r\nbodies of the United Nations development system to assist\r\nthe small island developing States in renewing existing\r\nactivities to ensure that they become compatible with the\r\nrequirements and aspirations enunciated in the Programme\r\nof Action as a whole.\r\nWe believe that the post-cold-war world provides us\r\nwith ample room for new partnerships in the field of\r\ngenuine cooperation between developing and developed\r\nStates to effect sustainable development. It is fundamental\r\nthat the United Nations system and the international\r\ncommunity as a whole support the efforts deployed in\r\nsuch a task and that the parameters set at the Barbados\r\nConference to promote the ideals of sustainable and\r\nenvironmentally sound development ensure that the\r\nquestion of adopting mechanisms to guarantee developing\r\nStates access to the new environmental technologies on\r\nfavourable terms continue to be addressed on a priority\r\nbasis.\r\nWe consider that the Declaration and the Programme\r\nof Action emanating from Barbados derive from Agenda\r\n21, the Rio Declaration and the Convention on Biological\r\nDiversity, which must continue to be our beacons. Let us\r\nabide by them, for we are certain that small island\r\ndeveloping States, given appropriate assistance by the\r\ninternational community, can and will implement relevant\r\nplans and programmes to support their development.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nI wish, in conclusion, to quote words used by\r\nMr. Henrique Brandão Cavalcanti, Minister for the\r\nEnvironment of Brazil, in his statement at the opening\r\nsession in Barbados:\r\n“The objective of our common effort is, of\r\ncourse, sustainable development. That is nothing but\r\na change in the present patterns of utilization of the\r\nEarth’s resources in order to achieve sound economic\r\nprogress without compromising the ability of future\r\ngenerations to do the same, and we must continue to\r\npursue the removal of all obstacles to the attainment\r\nof sustainable development.”\r\nI must, therefore, stress the great importance of the\r\nBarbados Global Conference and call upon the international\r\ncommunity to honour the commitments to a new\r\npartnership that were undertaken both in Rio and in\r\nBridgetown.\r\nMr. Bivero (Venezuela) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI should like to convey Venezuela’s condolences to the\r\npeople and the Government of Egypt following the tragic\r\nnatural disaster in their country.\r\nThe outcomes of the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, which took place in Bridgetown, Barbados, earlier\r\nthis year, are of great importance to Venezuela. The\r\nBarbados Declaration and Programme of Action flowed\r\nfrom Agenda 21 in an area that is of particular interest to\r\nVenezuela, which has an extensive continental and island\r\ncoastline on the Caribbean. We share with the small island\r\ndeveloping countries of the Caribbean geographical and\r\nenvironmental realities, as well as the obligation to promote\r\nsustainable development in our subregion. Venezuela\r\nsupports the Barbados Programme of Action and would like\r\nto reiterate that it is committed to making a contribution to\r\nachieving the aims stated therein.\r\nAlthough the self-sufficiency objective of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action is commendable, the Programme\r\nacknowledges the need for the support of the community of\r\ndonor countries. The channelling of additional funds for\r\nregional and interregional cooperation into support activities\r\nis turning out to be critical at this stage. We share the\r\nobjective of the acquisition of new and additional resources,\r\nand we are convinced that the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action will demonstrate the need for them\r\nin the medium term and in the long term.\r\nIn our opinion, capacity-building and the study on a\r\ntechnical assistance programme that was undertaken by\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme in fulfilment\r\nof the request contained in the Programme of Action are\r\nof paramount importance at the initial stage.\r\nVenezuela will consider how it might strengthen its\r\nsupport for the Programme.\r\nAs Venezuela’s Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nindicated during the high-level segment of the Barbados\r\nConference,\r\n“Venezuela adheres to the Barbados\r\nDeclaration and considers itself bound by and\r\ncommitted to the Programme of Action.”\r\nThere are many examples of the way in which\r\nglobal interdependence and shared responsibility have\r\nshed light on the problems of the small island developing\r\ncountries. Only by working together can we benefit from\r\nour experiences and try to combine our efforts to solve\r\nthese problems. To this end, the greatest assets are the\r\nhuman resources of the developing island countries\r\nthemselves and of other countries whose national\r\ndevelopment processes are similar to ours, the United\r\nNations system and the community of donor countries.\r\nWe now have a comprehensive framework within\r\nwhich to contribute towards supporting the efforts of the\r\nsmall island developing countries. The Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action will be a milestone in the process\r\nof implementing Agenda 21, both politically and\r\neconomically. We trust that the international community,\r\nbilaterally and multilaterally, will respond constructively\r\nto this challenge.\r\nMr. Razali (Malaysia): We all share the concerns of\r\nthe small island developing States regarding their unique\r\nvulnerabilities. These range from economic and ecological\r\ndifficulties to security challenges. In recognition of the\r\nurgent need to address the threats to the survival of small\r\nisland developing countries, the United Nations, together\r\nwith the Government of Barbados, hosted the Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States in Barbados in April-May 1994.\r\nMalaysia was represented at ministerial level, as we\r\nwanted to demonstrate our solidarity with and our support\r\nfor the small island developing States.\r\nThe Barbados Conference adopted a comprehensive\r\nProgramme of Action, which addresses the range of\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nissues that affect the small island developing States. The\r\nProgramme of Action, which contains 15 chapters, serves\r\nas the basis of and provides a blueprint for the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island developing States. It must be\r\nimplemented, in full and in a timely manner.\r\nThe Barbados Conference has a special meaning for\r\nall of us as, following the Rio Conference, it was the first\r\nglobal meeting, in implementation of Agenda 21, devoted\r\nto the question of sustainable development. The\r\nimplementation of the Barbados commitments would be an\r\nimportant indicator of our collective determination to pursue\r\nglobal sustainable development.\r\nMalaysia considers Chapter XV of the Programme of\r\nAction, which relates to implementation, monitoring and\r\nreview of the programme at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels, as the most important chapter. Although\r\nthe implementation of policies and programmes to achieve\r\nsustainable development is primarily the responsibility of\r\nthe countries concerned, the support of the developed\r\ncountries, United Nations bodies and the specialized\r\nintergovernmental bodies is essential. Indeed, this\r\ncommitment was underscored at the Rio Summit in June\r\n1992. In this regard, the developed countries should honour\r\ntheir commitments made at Rio by supporting the\r\nendeavours of the developing countries through the\r\nprovision of new and additional financial resources and\r\nenvironmentally sound technologies on concessional and\r\npreferential terms and through avoidance of resort to\r\nenvironmental conditionalities on trade and development.\r\nChapter 15 of the Programme of Action also\r\nrecognizes small island developing States’ dependence on\r\noverseas markets for value-added exports in areas in which\r\nthey are internationally competitive and their need to\r\ndevelop those markets. In the area of international trade, the\r\nsmall island developing States face the same problems as\r\ndo other developing countries with regard to unjustified and\r\nunilateral impediments that erode the competitive advantage\r\nof developing countries.\r\nWhile we all need to make the transition to sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the bulk of the burden of change should not\r\nbe placed on the developing countries, including the small\r\nisland States. As it is, the developed countries already\r\npossess and enjoy competitive advantages in technology,\r\naccess to markets and capital and management skills,\r\ncompared with the severe handicaps of the small island\r\ndeveloping States, such as unfavourable terms of trade and\r\nprohibitive costs of transportation, arising from their\r\ndistance and isolation from international shipping routes.\r\nOf no less importance is chapter XIV, which focuses\r\non human-resource development. In this respect, Malaysia\r\nis committed to the promotion of South-South\r\ncooperation, by which we share and exchange experiences\r\non development matters, especially human-resource\r\ndevelopment. In 1980 Malaysia launched the Malaysian\r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme (MTCP) in order to\r\nprovide technical assistance to other developing countries.\r\nThe MTCP consolidates various forms of technical\r\ncooperation in areas where Malaysia has experience and\r\nexpertise. It is based on the belief that the development of\r\na country depends on the quality of its human resources;\r\nhence its emphasis on the development of human\r\nresources through training. Malaysia’s assistance under\r\nthe MTCP is essentially in the form of training,\r\nconducted either at Malaysian universities or at training\r\ninstitutions. Other forms of assistance include study visits,\r\nservices of experts, and the provision of supplies and\r\nequipment for socio-economic projects. To date, more\r\nthan 84 countries, including small island States, have\r\nbenefited in varying degrees from the MTCP.\r\nThe small island developing countries could also\r\nbenefit from participating in the projects implemented by\r\nthe Group of 15 for the promotion of South-South\r\ncooperation. The projects involve training and exchanges\r\nin experiences in the fields of finance, trade, information,\r\nscience and technology, environment and population.\r\nMalaysia has also actively cooperated through the\r\nCommonwealth, which has played a leadership role in\r\naddressing the concerns of small island developing States.\r\nWe share the growing concern of the small island\r\ndeveloping States, as well as of other developing\r\ncountries, regarding the transboundary movement of toxic\r\nand hazardous waste and the possible damage inflicted by\r\nforeign ships carrying toxic and radioactive materials\r\nthrough their seas. Such disposal of toxic, hazardous and\r\nradioactive wastes, as well as oil spills and desludging\r\nactivities that result in the generation of hazardous waste,\r\nhas a serious effect on both marine and land resources. In\r\nthis regard, the recommendations contained in chapter III\r\nof the Programme of Action, which calls for international\r\ncooperation to ensure the strengthening of institutions to\r\nprovide assistance to Governments and industry in the\r\nadoption of clean technologies as well as in the\r\nprevention of pollution and the handling, treatment and\r\ndisposal of hazardous wastes, should be implemented on\r\na priority basis.\r\nWe recognize that small island developing States are\r\nin the front line of possible ecological disasters as a result\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nof climate change. As the small island developing States are\r\nextremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change,\r\nfinancial and technical support from the developed countries\r\nand the international community for monitoring impact\r\nassessment and adaptation is an urgent necessity.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in response to paragraph 106\r\nof the Programme of Action, has circulated document\r\nA/49/459, which contains specific recommendations for\r\ntechnical assistance. The early implementation of these\r\nrecommendations would mitigate some of the immediate\r\nconcerns. At the same time, the presence of an entity in the\r\nSecretariat to monitor the Programme of Action would\r\nensure that attention continued to be given to the threats\r\nand problems facing small island developing States.\r\nTwo weeks ago, in the Fourth Committee, we had the\r\noccasion to deliberate on the security of small States. A\r\nconsensus resolution was adopted following the debate,\r\nsignifying agreement to address the security needs —\r\nindeed, the survival needs — of small States. The\r\neconomic, ecological and security challenges confronting\r\nthe small island developing States must be effectively\r\naddressed to ensure their continued well-being. Our\r\ncommitment, through the Barbados Programme of Action,\r\nto assisting the small island developing States will without\r\nany doubt contribute to the long-term sustainable growth,\r\nsecurity and stability of small States.\r\nMr. Gallegos (United States of America): We also\r\njoin in sending condolences to the Egyptian delegation on\r\nthe tragic losses resulting from the recent devastating\r\nfloods.\r\nAs the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island States demonstrated, small\r\nisland developing States are playing an increasingly active\r\nand better-defined role in diverse world and regional\r\norganizations.\r\nThe United States seeks to cooperate with island\r\nnations in the struggle to generate sustainable economic\r\ngrowth. The Barbados Conference, which addressed this\r\nissue, established an agenda to which we are committed.\r\nThe agenda outlined steps that need to be taken globally,\r\nregionally and locally in 14 key areas. We intend to work\r\nwith the international community to follow up the\r\nConference in order to give its work real content and to\r\nactivate the Programme it adopted.\r\nThe United States was pleased to take an active role\r\nin Barbados. We are moving forward on development of a\r\ncoral-reef initiative, as explained by Under-Secretary\r\nWirth at the Conference. The United States believes that,\r\nbecause many of the world’s coral reefs are located in\r\nsmall island developing States, a practical approach to\r\ntheir protection would address key concerns raised in the\r\nConference such as biodiversity, habitat protection,\r\nnatural-disaster protection and climate change.\r\nWe are working to ensure the participation of\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, international and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, academia and the private\r\nsector in this effort. In this regard, let us bear in mind,\r\nwhile considering the issues of sustainable development\r\nin small island States, that there is no substitute for\r\nprivate-sector economic growth. Whether one considers\r\nwhat sort of governmental economic policy to put in\r\nplace, how to educate and train people so as to improve\r\ntheir lives or how to define the type of technical\r\nassistance to be sought from abroad, it is the private\r\nsector that will ultimately determine the success or failure\r\nof the policy. Good government can help, but chiefly in\r\na supportive role, such as spadework organization, start-\r\nup infrastructure, the fostering of a positive business\r\nclimate, and assistance in publicizing the opportunities\r\navailable. Inefficient government, of course, can quickly\r\ndo far more to reduce or prevent growth.\r\nIn addition to the important coral-reef initiative I\r\nhave mentioned, my Government expects to follow up on\r\nthe Barbados Conference in a number of other ways:\r\nthrough bilateral programmes, the World Bank, the\r\nregional development banks and other multilateral-\r\nassistance agencies.\r\nWe continue to advocate sustainable development\r\nmeasures, such as environmental-impact statements,\r\nenergy efficiency and integrated coastal-resource\r\nmanagement. We will work to ensure that the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development undertakes the\r\nimportant reviews that will be necessary to ensure\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nMrs. Hassan (Pakistan): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Pakistan, my delegation would\r\nlike to express our condolences to our Egyptian brothers,\r\nespecially those affected by the tragedy, on the loss of\r\nlife and property in the recent disastrous floods.\r\nMy delegation had the great honour to participate in\r\nthe preparatory process of the first Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates and in the Conference itself. My Government’s\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\ncommitment to work with the small island developing\r\ncountries in finding solutions to their difficult problems was\r\nevidenced by the presence of a special representative of\r\nPrime Minister Bhutto at the high-level segment of the\r\nBarbados Conference.\r\nToday is yet another historic moment in the history of\r\nthe United Nations, and especially of the developing\r\ncountries. With the adoption of the Programme of Action\r\nagreed at the Barbados Conference, the United Nations will\r\nbe on the way to implementing this important document,\r\nwhich is expected to directly affect the lives of many in the\r\nsmall island developing States.\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the Government\r\nof Barbados on the success of the Conference. Our deep\r\nadmiration also goes to Ambassador Annette des Iles, the\r\nPermanent Representative of Trinidad and Tobago, for her\r\nstewardship in articulating the viewpoint of the developing\r\ncountries at the Conference.\r\nPakistan is not a small island, but we share common\r\nperceptions on development issues with our friends from\r\nthe small island developing States. Our problems are similar\r\nin intensity, though they may be a shade different in nature.\r\nPakistan associates itself fully with the views and\r\naspirations of all the developing countries on issues related\r\nto the environment and development, and therefore the\r\noutcome of the Barbados Conference was extremely\r\nimportant to us. We are convinced that the implementation\r\nof the recommendations of the Conference will go a long\r\nway in determining the path to be adopted by other\r\ndeveloping countries in the pursuance of sustainable\r\ndevelopment objectives.\r\nAwareness of environmental issues has grown over the\r\npast two decades. This awareness has emerged among and\r\nwithin Governments as they have addressed environmental\r\nproblems singly, bilaterally, regionally and globally. Despite\r\nRio and the apparent shared perceptions regarding\r\nenvironmental problems and actions, environmental\r\ndegradation has continued unabated, threatening human\r\nwell-being and, in some instances, the very survival of life\r\non our planet. Environmental issues are the urgent concern\r\nof all peoples of the world. They demonstrate in a dramatic\r\nway the need for international cooperation.\r\nThe high-level segment of the Conference, entitled\r\n“Forging partnerships for sustainable development”,\r\nprovided an opportunity for statesmen and high-level\r\nrepresentatives to come together and discuss in a frank and\r\nopen manner whether the commitments made at Rio had\r\nled to the forging of a new global partnership for\r\nsustainable development. Rio started a realistic process,\r\nand the results of the Earth Summit provided a solid base\r\nfor decisive action based on this new partnership.\r\nIt was evident during the discussions in the high-\r\nlevel segment that, while Rio had laid the foundations of\r\nthis partnership, the destructive patterns of human\r\nconsumption and production were continuing unabated.\r\nLess than 20 per cent of the world’s population in the\r\ndeveloped countries continue to use 80 per cent of the\r\nworld’s resources. Their decades of unplanned\r\nindustrialization and unsustainable methods of production\r\nand the exploitation of resources without any regard for\r\nthe future have contributed to the deterioration of the\r\nenvironment, causing environmental changes that threaten\r\nthe very existence of some small islands.\r\nSmall islands are truly, in the words of\r\nDavid Herbert Lawrence,\r\n“vivid fragments of life (...) they are a celebration,\r\nin the sea”.\r\nThe beauty that surrounds us in an island is, however,\r\nthreatened by an in-built fragility and vulnerability to the\r\nforces of nature, as well as by human and environmental\r\ndegradation. The Barbados Conference achieved one of its\r\nobjectives: sensitizing the international community to the\r\nproblems of the small island developing countries as\r\n“high-risk entities”.\r\nThe gross national product of some small island\r\ndeveloping States may place a small number of them\r\namong middle-income economies. However, such criteria\r\nare certainly extremely deceptive. The sustainability of the\r\neconomic base of even the most affluent among the small\r\nislands cannot be assured, in view of their special\r\ncircumstances. The international community must\r\nrecognize this fact. The Programme of Action\r\nacknowledges that the small island developing States face\r\npeculiar environmental and development challenges.\r\nPakistan is extremely sensitive to the vulnerabilities\r\nof the small island developing States, whose small size,\r\nlimited resources, geographic dispersion and isolation\r\nfrom markets place them at a disadvantage economically.\r\nThey are vulnerable to global warming and rise in sea\r\nlevels, with certain low-lying islands facing the increasing\r\nthreat of the loss of their entire national territories. The\r\nfrequency of natural disasters has caused major setbacks\r\nto the socio-economic development of the small islands.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nPakistan was honoured to participate in the process of\r\ndesigning sustainable development plans and programmes\r\ntailored to the specific needs of the island States.\r\nPakistan is committed to making sustainable\r\ndevelopment a reality. We are fully cognizant of the fact\r\nthat there is a great need to integrate economic and\r\nenvironmental priorities at the national level. Similarly,\r\nglobal efforts are required to address environmental and\r\ndevelopment issues in an integrated manner.\r\nThe efforts of the small island developing countries to\r\nsensitize the international community to their problems\r\ndeserve our admiration. Despite their limited human\r\nresources at United Nations Headquarters, they have been\r\nable to garner the support of the international community\r\nfor a Programme of Action that could be the first concrete\r\nstep towards the implementation of the recommendations of\r\nAgenda 21 as they relate to the small islands.\r\nThe small island developing States require immediate\r\naction and attention. Even a day lost in launching the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action would exact a\r\nheavy price, especially for those small islands whose very\r\nexistence is threatened by the forces of nature. At the\r\nBarbados Conference the international community, through\r\nthe adoption of the Programme of Action, recognized that\r\nthe small island developing States face peculiar\r\nenvironmental and developmental problems.\r\nThe implementation of the Programme of Action will\r\nrequire additional financial commitments, both by national\r\nGovernments and the international community. The\r\nexpectation that such resources can be made available\r\nmerely through a re-ordering of priorities is certainly not a\r\nrealistic one. Most of the islands have small economies,\r\nwith a great degree of built-in unpredictability, whether due\r\nto natural forces or to the structure of the economy. It is\r\ndifficult to expect that such economies would be able to\r\ngenerate the extra resources without external financial\r\nassistance.\r\nThe adoption of the Programme of Action by the\r\nGeneral Assembly will be another step towards the new\r\nglobal partnership and a reaffirmation by the international\r\ncommunity of its responsibility to assist the small island\r\ndeveloping States in their own endeavours to assure a\r\nsecure and predictable lifestyle to their people.\r\nTo conclude, we hope that the Programme of Action\r\nwill allow for the development of appropriate strategies by\r\nthe small island developing States that will enable them to\r\npursue their sustainable development goals despite their\r\nnatural vulnerabilities. It also provides other developing\r\ncountries with an identifiable framework within which\r\nSouth-South activities can be carried out. While South-\r\nSouth cooperation is an important mechanism for learning\r\nfrom the experiences of the developing countries, the\r\nconcept of international responsibility as included in\r\nAgenda 21 must not be allowed to erode.\r\nThe developed countries have an important role to\r\nplay in assisting the small island developing countries in\r\nthe implementation of the Programme of Action. The\r\nfollow-up process in the Commission for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment will ensure the full participation of all\r\ncountries in the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction. We assure our friends from the small island\r\ndeveloping States of our complete and full support to\r\nachieve the objectives of the Programme of Action and\r\nthe Declaration of Barbados.\r\nMr. Isakov (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): At the outset, on behalf of the Russian\r\ndelegation, I wish to join in the expressions of sympathy\r\non the tragedy suffered by the people and the Government\r\nof Egypt in the recent flooding.\r\nThe Barbados Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States marked\r\nan important step forward in the implementation of the\r\ndecisions of the Rio de Janeiro Conference. In our view,\r\nthe Programme of Action agreed upon in Barbados has\r\npractical significance for a purposeful solution to the\r\nproblems of preserving the small islands’ unique\r\necosystems and of stimulating their economic\r\ndevelopment. The Programme of Action’s extensive\r\nmeasures in such areas as natural disaster prevention and\r\npreparedness, the safe removal of toxic and other wastes,\r\nthe preservation of marine coastal and land resources, the\r\nsustainable provision of clean drinking water, the\r\ndiversification of sources of energy production and\r\n“disciplined” tourism, as we see it, are all intended to\r\nensure a more economical and attentive attitude on the\r\npart of national Governments and the international\r\ncommunity towards the integrated problems of island\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOne important area in which the island States can\r\nexploit their own efforts, coupled with international\r\nassistance, is the development of human potential in such\r\nareas as the preservation of culture, raising educational\r\nlevels and the provision of housing and medical services.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nOf special significance is the active use of modern\r\nscientific, technical and information potential capable of\r\nensuring the expanded use of environmentally safe and\r\ninexpensive technologies, especially in the areas of\r\nagriculture, energy, public health and effective monitoring\r\nof the environment. In this connection, the Russian\r\ndelegation notes its readiness to establish and develop\r\ncooperation with the small island States in those areas. The\r\nsustainable development interests of those States would be\r\nserved by the applied use of my country’s scientific\r\nresearch and practical experience in building a “small\r\neconomy”, preserving the diversity and uniqueness of the\r\ncultures of the indigenous peoples of Russia, developing\r\ncoastal infrastructures and protecting the living resources of\r\nthe sea.\r\nI should like to express the hope that the\r\nimplementation called for at the Barbados Conference of\r\npractical approaches and joint efforts for the survival and\r\ndevelopment of islands throughout the world’s oceans and\r\nseas will be accompanied by the necessary political will and\r\nan awareness of common responsibilities for preserving the\r\nuniqueness of our planet.\r\nMr. Pursoo (Grenada): I should first like to join\r\nprevious speakers in conveying condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Egypt on the loss of life and\r\nproperty caused by the recent flood in that country.\r\nGrenada associates itself with the statements made by\r\nthe Chairman of the Group of 77; Ambassador Annette des\r\nIles, Chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States; and\r\nthe Minister of Tourism of Barbados, speaking on behalf of\r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\r\nIn reaffirmation of the importance of Agenda 21 and\r\nin recognition of the special circumstances confronting the\r\ndevelopment of small island developing States, the United\r\nNations convened the first ever Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, in Barbados from 25 April to 6 May 1994. It\r\nafforded small island developing States the opportunity to\r\nbring before the world community observations and studies\r\nof the specific characteristics which adversely affect their\r\nability to achieve sustainable development. The Conference\r\ngenerated a global effort which produced a Programme of\r\nAction to address the areas of priority to sustainable island\r\ndevelopment. Grenada wishes to reiterate its deep\r\nappreciation to the organizers and participants of the\r\nConference — in particular the United Nations and the host\r\ncountry, Barbados — and for the follow-up arrangements\r\nin progress, especially the SIDS/TAP and SIDS/NET\r\ninitiatives undertaken by the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme. We also wish to express appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his reports and notes contained in\r\ndocuments A/49/425 and its addendum, A/49/414 and\r\nA/49/459.\r\nThere exist similar programmes of action, but such\r\nprogrammes in themselves are no guarantee of a solution\r\nto the problems they address. In this specific case,\r\npolitical will and financial means are the two most vital\r\ningredients, without which the Global Conference’s\r\nProgramme of Action would most likely go the way of\r\nseveral of its predecessors — into oblivion. But the spirit\r\nof cooperation which was born in Rio at the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development in\r\nJune 1992, and the overall realization of global\r\ninterdependence in conjunction with the common but\r\ndifferentiated responsibility to secure the welfare of all\r\nconstituencies of our planet, give reason for hope.\r\nThe successful implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction of the Barbados Conference holds out specific\r\ndevelopment benefits to small island developing States\r\nand indeed represents their hope. But failure successfully\r\nto implement this Programme of Action could lead to a\r\nvoid that could in turn entail setbacks and disruptions far\r\nbeyond the shorelines of those islands. The problems of\r\nsmall island developing States are indeed a matter of\r\nglobal concern and therefore the solution to those\r\nproblems must of necessity be in large measure global in\r\nscope.\r\nThe Programme of Action did not seek to address all\r\nthe problems, development options and special needs of\r\nsmall island developing States. Instead, it addressed those\r\nthat were deemed most critical, most essential and most\r\nfeasible. It has been intentionally fashioned to lead to ease\r\nof implementation.\r\nThe disadvantages characteristic of the development\r\nof small island developing States are severe and\r\nnumerous — the prospects and options are but few. The\r\nprotection of our environment, the sustainable exploitation\r\nof our scant resources and the enhancement of our\r\ninstitutional and administrative capacities require at this\r\ntime the forging of new and special partnerships.\r\nGrenada wishes to express its appreciation to the\r\ndonor countries, organizations and bodies within and\r\noutside the United Nations system that have responded to\r\nthe special needs of small island developing States and\r\nhave pledged continued support. Small island developing\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 7 November 1994\r\nStates have been made to understand that “aid fatigue” is\r\nwearing thin the resolve, and taxing the will, of traditional\r\nassistance processes.\r\nWe have been urged to be more creative in dealing\r\nwith the constraints, challenges, prospects and options\r\nfacing our countries. Small island developing states are\r\ntruly appreciative of such encouragement, for we are\r\ncognizant that chronic dependency on aid can lead to an\r\nacquired immunity deficiency syndrome, to the detriment of\r\nthe health of our economies. And so our economic\r\ndevelopment objectives are guided by the need to achieve\r\nself-sufficiency and genuine sustainability within the\r\nframework of global interdependence.\r\nAt the same time, the international economic\r\nenvironment of the l990s stresses competition, a\r\ncircumstance which increases the uncertainty of small\r\nisland developing States; for global competition in the\r\nl990s demands technological competence, and it is no\r\nsecret that, among the several handicaps that adversely\r\naffect the economic development of small island\r\ndeveloping States, the lack of technological capacity ranks\r\nhigh. Traditionally, small island developing States have\r\nacted responsibly in taking care of themselves, but\r\nglobalization and technological developments have\r\nbrought new challenges which require specific assistance\r\nmerely to cope. Global cooperation to ensure the\r\nsuccessful implementation of the Programme of Action\r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States remains a vital contribution to the hope\r\nof small island developing States.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker on\r\nthis item.\r\nIn accordance with the decision taken by the\r\nAssembly at its 30th plenary meeting, action on this\r\nsub-item will be taken in the Second Committee.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of sub-item (e) of agenda item 89.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.35 p.m.\r\n22\r\n"
