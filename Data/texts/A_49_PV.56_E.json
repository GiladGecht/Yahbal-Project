(Coté d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 149\r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution\r\nof Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of\r\nInternational Humanitarian Law Committed in the\r\nTerritory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991: note by\r\nthe Secretary-General transmitting the first annual\r\nreport of the International Tribunal (A/49/342)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nGeneral Assembly has before it the first report of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991. This report covers the\r\nperiod from 17 November 1993 to 28 July 1994 and is\r\ncontained in document A/49/342.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of the first\r\nreport of the International Tribunal?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Antonio Cassese, President of the International\r\nTribunal.\r\nMr. Cassese (President, International Tribunal for the\r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations\r\nof International Humanitarian Law Committed in the\r\nTerritory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991): I am\r\nmost grateful for the signal honour of being invited to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nOf course, I shall not summarize the first annual\r\nreport of the international criminal Tribunal for the former\r\nYugoslavia. I shall simply draw the Assembly’s attention\r\nto some crucial issues concerning the establishment and\r\nfunctioning of the Tribunal.\r\nI shall divide my exposition into four parts. First, I\r\nshall briefly recall the unique nature of the Tribunal.\r\nSecondly, I shall try to cast light on some of the many\r\nproblems that have so far beset the existence of the\r\nTribunal. Thirdly, I shall provide an update to our annual\r\nreport. Fourthly, I shall set out a few final reflections.\r\nJust a few words will suffice to bring to the fore the\r\nnovelty and crucial significance of the Tribunal. It cannot\r\nbe denied that we are currently witnessing an escalation\r\nin both national and international violence. This escalation\r\nis not only quantitative but also qualitative, in a sinister\r\nway. In previous times, when individuals and State agents\r\nperpetrated vicious crimes, they hastened to cover them\r\nup, or else they denied being involved in their\r\ncommission. These expedients, however hypocritical,\r\nshowed, nevertheless, that individuals and States were\r\nendeavouring to cleanse their consciences by claiming\r\nthat they had not, in fact, misbehaved. In recent years\r\neven this pretence of good behaviour has been dropped:\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nindividuals and State agents engage in barbarous misdeeds\r\nwithout fear of the moral and political blame of the world\r\ncommunity. They slaughter, maim and kill without even\r\nattempting to conceal their murderous hand.\r\nThe quality of violence has also changed in a second\r\nrespect. Conflict, animosity and ethnic, racial and social\r\ntension tend to be dramatically radicalized and to find their\r\nsole outlet in physical violence. We are also witnessing an\r\nevil implementation of the concept that the political\r\nuniverse falls into two categories: friend or enemy. “Either\r\nyou are on my side, and I shall lend you a supportive hand,\r\nor you are my foe, and I shall give you no quarter.” In this\r\nManichean vision of life and society, little or no space is\r\nleft for mutual understanding, for compromise, for the\r\namicable settlement of differences.\r\nFaced with this calamitous plunge into violence, the\r\ninternational community’s response, at least with regard to\r\ntwo areas of conflict — first the former Yugoslavia and\r\nnow Rwanda — has been drastic: those suspected of\r\noutrages against humanity must be brought to justice at the\r\ninternational level; if found guilty, they must be sternly\r\npunished by a truly international and truly impartial body,\r\nbefore the very eyes of the whole international community.\r\nIt is apparent that the creation of these two institutions, so\r\nstrongly willed by the international community, signals an\r\nimpressive turning-point. The United Nations has not only\r\nbuilt up a powerful bridgehead in its fight against\r\ninhumanity, but has also reinforced that position at the first\r\npossible opportunity. These important steps make it possible\r\nto cherish the hope that the United Nations will eventually\r\nestablish a criminal court of a permanent nature for the\r\npunishment of outrages against humanity, wherever they\r\nmay be perpetrated.\r\nLet me move on to my second point, which can be set\r\nout as follows: How is it that 12 months after the\r\nestablishment of this ground-breaking institution, the\r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia, no trials have yet been\r\nconducted at The Hague? To answer this question I need to\r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to something which may\r\nseem obvious, and is indeed obvious, but which ought\r\nnevertheless to be borne in mind. To make an international\r\ncriminal tribunal function one needs several things. One\r\nneeds a courtroom and a secure place to hold the accused\r\npending trial. One also needs international prosecutors and\r\njudges as well as law clerks, experts in court management,\r\ncourt reporters and other appropriate staff. In addition, one\r\nneeds security officers responsible for the protection of\r\njudges and prosecutors as well as of victims, witnesses and\r\ndefendants. On top of that, one needs guards charged with\r\nthe custody of persons awaiting trial. It is clear that, even\r\nat this simple level, the logistical requirements of an\r\ninternational criminal court are numerous and varied, and\r\nmarkedly different from those necessary for setting up\r\nany of the various administrative bodies of the United\r\nNations.\r\nTo depict graphically the way the international\r\ncriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has tackled\r\nthis huge array of problems, let me draw a parallel with\r\nthe most important precedent at hand: the International\r\nMilitary Tribunal at Nuremberg.\r\nAt Nuremberg the bulk of the logistic resources was\r\nprovided by the armies of the four victor Powers — in\r\nparticular, by the United States Army. Whenever\r\ninvestigators, court reporters and other personnel were\r\nneeded, the Nuremberg Tribunal tapped the huge\r\nresources of one of the occupying armies, and the\r\nproblems were settled with military dispatch and\r\nefficiency. For example, it was from General Eisenhower\r\nthat the Tribunal obtained its “Registrar”, as well as\r\napproval for the payment of compensation to defence\r\ncounsel. This made it possible for the trial to start with\r\nsurprising speed — only three and a half months after the\r\nadoption of the Nuremberg Statute.\r\nThings have gone differently with our Tribunal. Our\r\nTribunal is a truly international institution. It is the\r\nexpression of the entire world community, and not the\r\nlong arm of four powerful victors. As a consequence, our\r\nTribunal could only draw upon the resources made\r\navailable to it by this world Organization, as well as\r\nvoluntary contributions by States.\r\nI shall not recount all the logistic, financial and other\r\npractical problems bedeviling the initial life of the\r\nTribunal. These problems are set out in full in our annual\r\nreport. Let me simply draw attention to three.\r\nFirst, for many months after the institution of the\r\nTribunal, the lack of a regular budget made it impossible\r\nto build a courtroom. As a consequence, a courtroom is\r\nonly now available — 12 months after the setting up of\r\nthe Tribunal. The same applies to the construction of a\r\nspecial detention unit under United Nations authority and\r\ncontrol at The Hague. Despite the best efforts of all\r\ninvolved, this unit was ready only 11 months after the\r\ninstitution of the Tribunal.\r\nEven more serious problems were caused by the lack\r\nof a Prosecutor. For many months this was a matter of\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nserious disquiet, for, under our Statute, no criminal\r\nproceedings can be started unless the Prosecutor submits an\r\nindictment. A Prosecutor was appointed by the Security\r\nCouncil in October 1993, but did not take office. Only in\r\nJuly 1994 — eight months after the Tribunal’s\r\nestablishment — was it possible for the Security Council to\r\nreach agreement on the appointment of another Prosecutor.\r\nOur Prosecutor, Justice Richard Goldstone, took office on\r\n15 August this year — that is, eight and a half months after\r\nthe initiation of the Tribunal’s work.\r\nIn addition to these two major problems, let me draw\r\nattention to a third and fundamental difficulty that our\r\nTribunal has had to face. This difficulty is not caused by\r\nfinancial or logistic strictures, but is inherent in the conduct\r\nof international criminal proceedings. To describe this\r\ndifficulty, it may be useful briefly to compare our criminal\r\nproceedings with what normally happens in a national\r\ncriminal case, on the one hand, and with the way in which\r\ninternational bodies normally collect information about\r\nserious breaches of international law, on the other. I shall\r\nstart with a comparison with domestic criminal\r\ninvestigations.\r\nLet us take a case of murder, the crime closest to\r\nthose over which our International Tribunal has jurisdiction.\r\nWithin a national setting, when a murder is committed,\r\nnormally there is one victim and one offender. The police\r\nare able to commence their investigations immediately. As\r\na rule, witnesses are not far from the location of the crime,\r\nand real evidence, such as weapons, blood and so on, can\r\nbe readily collected. Furthermore, the police are guided by\r\na set of clear legal rules and well-thumbed legal precedents.\r\nLet me stress two more points, which are also\r\nimportant. On average, five to 10 investigators are called in\r\nto take part in the inquiry, which, again on average, may\r\nlast many months. In addition, as soon as a suspect is\r\nidentified, he or she is arrested by the police, who can then\r\ncarry on their investigations and collection of evidence\r\nwithout fear that the presumed offender will escape. This is\r\nwhat happens in most States at the national level.\r\nLet us now turn to the international setting — in\r\nparticular, the setting of our Tribunal at The Hague. Here\r\nthings are quite different. First of all, the crime scene is\r\nnormally far from the seat of the investigators, as well as\r\nbeing inaccessible or, at any rate, not immediately\r\naccessible. Secondly, the crimes normally involve dozens of\r\nvictims and scores of perpetrators. Thirdly, there is little or\r\nno forensic evidence available when the investigators arrive.\r\nFourthly, often many States are involved in the\r\ninvestigations; the victims may have fled to various\r\ncountries, while the witnesses may have taken refuge in\r\nothers. Since each State has its own laws and its own\r\nbureaucracy, our Prosecutor needs to get in touch with\r\nand obtain cooperation from many different States.\r\nFifthly — and most importantly — our Prosecutor has no\r\nimmediate power of arrest, search or seizure. For this\r\npurpose he must turn to national authorities. However,\r\nbefore requesting the arrest, search or seizure, he must\r\nprove that there is a prima facie case — namely, that\r\nthere is sufficient evidence leading to the reasonable\r\nbelief that the suspect can be accused of the crime. It\r\nfollows that our Prosecutor cannot first arrange for the\r\narrest of the suspect and then collect the necessary\r\nevidence. No; he must first collect compelling evidence,\r\nand only at the end of this long process can he ask the\r\nnational authorities to apprehend the suspect.\r\nAll these difficulties inherent in international\r\ncriminal investigations are compounded by one striking\r\nfact: currently our Tribunal has approximately 20\r\ninvestigators for all the crimes over which it has\r\njurisdiction. In other words, it can count on the number of\r\ninvestigators normally used at the national level for just\r\ntwo or three murders. This, I believe, speaks volumes\r\nabout the tremendous problems with which we are\r\nconfronted.\r\nLet me now move quickly to a comparison of the\r\ncriminal investigation and prosecution processes of our\r\nTribunal with the way in which other international bodies\r\ncollect information about egregious violations of\r\ninternational legal standards. This comparison is also\r\nnecessary because many commentators have been\r\nwondering why, given the wealth of existing\r\ndocumentation on alleged crimes in the former\r\nYugoslavia — press reports and reports of Governments\r\nand non-governmental organizations, as well as the\r\nimpressive work accomplished by the Commission of\r\nExperts created by the Security Council — the Prosecutor\r\ndid not issue indictments immediately after taking office.\r\nThe problem is that those reports are a far cry from\r\nevidentiary material capable of standing up to judicial\r\nscrutiny. The task of our Prosecutor is to produce credible\r\nevidence to prove incredible events. This is a task which\r\nis fundamentally different from that of other bodies which\r\nare simply called upon to collect information.\r\nLet me give an example. Let us assume that the\r\nrepresentative of a non-governmental organization finds\r\nthat there are 50 bodies in the mortuary of a village\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\ninhabited by a certain ethnic group. He notes that all of\r\nthem have been killed by shelling. In addition, he is told by\r\nan inhabitant of the same village that on the previous day\r\na military group belonging to an enemy army, located in\r\nthe vicinity, attacked the village. In this case, that\r\nrepresentative may be warranted in concluding that a\r\nmassacre of civilians was perpetrated by that particular\r\narmy.\r\nOur Prosecutor needs to undertake much more\r\nextensive and complex investigations. He needs to prove\r\nthat the death of those people was indeed caused by the\r\nshelling and not by any other explosion or firing. He needs\r\nto ascertain whether or not all those in the mortuary were\r\nkilled by the same shelling; whether before dying they were\r\nthemselves fighters or, instead, peaceful civilians; and\r\nwhether any military installation was located close to the\r\nplace where they were killed. Furthermore, our Prosecutor\r\nneeds to identify those who carried out the shelling, the\r\nchain of command, whether or not orders were given to fire\r\non the village and so on. The Prosecutor also has the onus\r\nof establishing the guilt of the suspects beyond any\r\nreasonable doubt. As can be seen, the task of our\r\nProsecutor is more demanding than, and indeed different\r\nfrom, that of bodies and organizations responsible solely for\r\ncollecting information and preparing reports.\r\nI am aware that this is indeed a gloomy picture. Let\r\nme, however, emphasize one important point: the\r\ndifficulties to which I have drawn attention should in no\r\nway lead one to conclude that the conduct of international\r\ncriminal proceedings raises problems of such magnitude as\r\nto discourage resort to international criminal tribunals. Not\r\nat all! The practical and legal problems standing in the way\r\nof the good and speedy functioning of such tribunals are\r\nundoubtedly outweighed by the great merits of international\r\ncriminal justice.\r\nIndeed, in cases of gross and large-scale violations of\r\ninternational legal standards on human rights, particularly\r\nwhen such violations occur in time of armed conflict,\r\ninternational justice can guarantee absolute independence\r\nand objectivity as well as the correct application of those\r\ninternational legal standards. Often the national courts of\r\nthe State or States where the gross breaches have occurred\r\nmay not be in a position to render impartial justice, free\r\nfrom emotional or political overtones, and the courts of\r\nother States may lack the necessary jurisdiction.\r\nInternational justice thus becomes indispensable, the more\r\nso because the crimes at issue are so abhorrent and on such\r\na scale as to concern the whole international community.\r\nTrue, the realization of international justice faces many\r\npractical problems. The response to these problems must\r\nbe patience, perseverance and a strong will to overcome\r\nall existing and future difficulties.\r\nThat this must be the response is borne out by what\r\nhas happened to our Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\r\nIn spite of the numerous and diverse handicaps to which\r\nI have referred, the Tribunal’s action has only been\r\nslowed, not hamstrung. It was an uphill struggle, but we\r\nwon the fight. Without waiting until all the necessary\r\nfinancial and practical measures had been taken in New\r\nYork, the Tribunal’s judges resolutely put in hand all\r\nthose activities that were within their power. They have\r\nthus laid the groundwork for the initiation of criminal\r\nproceedings. Suffice it to mention, in this respect, the\r\nexpeditious elaboration and adoption of a mini-code of\r\ninternational criminal procedure — our rules of procedure\r\nand evidence; of the rules of detention, governing the\r\nholding of accused in the Tribunal’s custody while\r\nawaiting trial; and of the directive on the granting of legal\r\naid to defendants. These three sets of legal rules are\r\nindeed unprecedented in the international community.\r\nGiven the huge differences between our Tribunal and\r\nthose of Nuremberg and Tokyo, we had to sail into\r\nuncharted waters.\r\nThese three sets of legal rules will now make it\r\npossible for trials to commence, as soon as the necessary\r\nlegal and practical conditions are fulfilled.\r\nOne of the most important of these conditions — if\r\nnot the major condition — is the filing of indictments by\r\nthe Prosecutor. This is a crucial issue on which I wish to\r\nreport to the General Assembly — and this will be my\r\nthird point: namely, the updating of our first annual\r\nreport.\r\nAt present, in spite of all the existing difficulties, the\r\nProsecutor’s Office is investigating 12 cases involving\r\nmultiple suspects. Many of these investigations may\r\nrequire interviewing more than a hundred victims or\r\nwitnesses, of whom possibly 60 will be called to each\r\ntrial.\r\nThe investigations by the Prosecutor’s Office have\r\nalready yielded important results. In October the\r\nProsecutor lodged with the Registrar an application for\r\nthe deferral to our Tribunal of an important case then\r\npending before the German authorities, a case involving\r\ncharges of genocide, “ethnic cleansing”, torture and rape.\r\nLast week a Trial Chamber held a public hearing at The\r\nHague to examine the application, as well as the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nstatements made by the German Government and the\r\ndefence counsel, who had been granted leave to appear as\r\namici curiae. The Trial Chamber upheld the Prosecutor’s\r\napplication and requested Germany to remit the case to our\r\nInternational Tribunal. This first public hearing has at last\r\nmade our International Tribunal visible to the parties\r\nconcerned and to world public opinion. In a way, it has not\r\nonly marked the public birth of our Tribunal, but has also\r\ncountered, at least in part, the scepticism so frequently\r\nexpressed.\r\nIn addition, at the beginning of November the\r\nProsecutor issued an indictment involving charges of gross\r\nviolations of the Geneva Conventions and of the laws and\r\ncustoms of warfare, as well as charges of crimes against\r\nhumanity. This indictment has already been confirmed by\r\nthe reviewing judge and made public. The reviewing judge\r\nalso issued two arrest warrants addressed to the relevant\r\nnational authorities. Soon the Prosecutor will submit further\r\nindictments.\r\nIt is thus apparent that the initial difficulties are being\r\novercome and the Tribunal’s work is proceeding at an\r\nincreasingly rapid pace. If, as I fervently hope, this\r\nAssembly supports our efforts and approves the budgetary\r\nrequests submitted by the Secretary-General, we in The\r\nHague expect a very busy 1995. We anticipate that from\r\nMarch 1995 the Tribunal will be in continuous session\r\nthroughout the year. The two Trial Chambers and the\r\nAppeals Chamber, having at their disposal only one\r\ncourtroom, will carry on alternate morning and afternoon\r\nproceedings.\r\nI shall wind up my statement with a few general\r\nreflections; they will constitute my fourth and final point.\r\nWe in The Hague are of course aware of the limitations on\r\nthe role of our Tribunal. We are aware that the sentences\r\nwe pass will not exhaust the poisoned wells of racial,\r\nnational or religious hatred. We also know, however, that\r\nthe setting up of our Tribunal is intended to signal that the\r\nworld community will not stand idly by, impassively or\r\nresignedly, and watch while barbarous acts are perpetrated,\r\nunconcerned and unaffected by them only because they are\r\ncommitted in what is for most of us a far-away land, the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. You, the Members of this Assembly,\r\ntogether with the Security Council, have decided that\r\nmassacre, rape, “ethnic cleansing” and the wanton killing of\r\ncivilians affect each and every one of us, whatever our\r\nnationality and wherever we live. They affect each and\r\nevery one of us because they imperil the great principles of\r\ncivilization enshrined in international legal standards of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nIn concluding, let me emphasize that our Tribunal\r\ncould not have achieved even the initial progress it has\r\nmade to date without the support of all the State\r\nrepresentatives sitting here today. Some have supported us\r\nwith donations to the Trust Fund of money, equipment,\r\npersonnel and so on. For that I thank them most sincerely\r\nand assure them that every last bit will be used\r\neffectively. I must now ask all States to continue to assist\r\nus generously, both by way of individual contributions\r\nand with overall support for our budget, which is again\r\nbefore this Assembly.\r\nThe tasks that the United Nations has entrusted to us\r\nare daunting. On the eve of the United Nations fiftieth\r\nanniversary, the Organization has decided that the United\r\nNations should broaden its arsenal of pacific means to\r\ninclude resort to international criminal justice as a lawful\r\nresponse to force and violence. All those who are\r\nworking on behalf of the Tribunal are aware of the heavy\r\nresponsibility they have been called upon to shoulder on\r\nbehalf of the whole international community. We shall\r\naccomplish the Tribunal’s mission to the very best of our\r\nability and energy. We hope thus to make our\r\ncontribution to alleviating the anguish and sorrow of all\r\nthose who continue to suffer, even as I speak now, in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\nshould like to propose that the list of speakers in the\r\ndebate on this item be closed this morning at 11 a.m.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I\r\ntherefore request those representatives wishing to\r\nparticipate in the debate to inscribe their names on the list\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nMrs. Hasan (Pakistan): With the adoption of\r\nresolution 827 (1993) on 25 May last year, the Security\r\nCouncil took the momentous decision to establish an\r\nInternational Tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting\r\npersons responsible for serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law committed in the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia since 1 January 1991.\r\nThe Nuremberg Tribunal and the Tokyo Tribunal\r\njudged on behalf of the international community those\r\nwho had committed crimes against humanity during the\r\nSecond World War. Those Tribunals were established by\r\nthe victors of the war and were created in very different\r\ncircumstances. They were based on moral and juridical\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nprinciples of a specific nature. In contrast, the International\r\nTribunal on the former Yugoslavia is the first ever\r\nestablished by the United Nations, and thus occupies a\r\nunique place in modern history. Its establishment is a\r\njudicial response to the demands posed by the situation in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, where appalling war crimes and\r\ncrimes against humanity have been perpetrated on a large\r\nscale, mainly by the Serbian side against the Muslims.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the historical\r\ncircumstances surrounding the creation and work of the\r\nNuremberg Tribunal were drastically different from those\r\nbehind the setting up of the International Tribunal for the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, one cannot fail to note that, in\r\ncomparison with the Nuremberg Tribunal, which was fully\r\noperational within eight months of its creation, the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is not yet\r\nin a position to accomplish its primary task: to render\r\njustice.\r\nWe are, however, encouraged to see the first annual\r\nreport of the International Tribunal transmitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly by the Tribunal’s President, Mr. Antonio\r\nCassese. This comprehensive report provides a detailed\r\naccount of the progress achieved and the remaining\r\nimpediments in the way of the Tribunal. My delegation\r\nexpresses the hope that the three categories of difficulties\r\npointed out in the first annual report of the Tribunal —\r\ndifficulties of a practical, financial and structural nature —\r\nwill be overcome quickly in order to render the Tribunal\r\nfunctional and effective as soon as possible.\r\nStrong support and assistance by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the generous cooperation of a number of States,\r\nnotably the host State, and the dedication of the Tribunal’s\r\nstaff have made it possible to lay a strong foundation for\r\nthe Tribunal’s tasks. In spite of its own resource\r\nconstraints, Pakistan has made a financial contribution of $1\r\nmillion to the Tribunal’s budget. We are also proud of the\r\nfact that Mr. Justice Rustam Sidhwa, an honourable and\r\ndistinguished Pakistani, is an elected Judge of the\r\nInternational Tribunal.\r\nWe note with appreciation that the essential legal\r\nframework for the Tribunal’s proceedings, including the\r\nrules of procedure and evidence, has been established.\r\nSuitable premises have been found for the Tribunal and\r\nadapted to the needs of the judicial process. An Acting\r\nRegistrar has been appointed, the Registry has been staffed,\r\nalthough not yet in full, and the core functions of the\r\nVictims and Witnesses Unit have been established. The\r\nDetention Unit, where the accused will be held pending\r\ntrial, has been built, and the necessary rules of detention\r\nhave been adopted by the Tribunal.\r\nOne of the most significant steps taken towards the\r\nrealization of the tasks of the International Tribunal was\r\nthe appointment of Judge Richard Goldstone as the\r\nProsecutor of the International Tribunal, who assumed his\r\nduties on 15 August 1994. My delegation would assure\r\nhim of our complete cooperation in the performance of\r\nhis important task. As the Office of the Prosecutor moves\r\nforward with its investigations, an issue of increasing\r\nimportance will be the protection of witnesses. All\r\nMember States must offer full assistance to the Office of\r\nthe Prosecutor, especially in the protection of witnesses.\r\nWe note that the first indictment was made by the\r\nTribunal on 7 November, charging a former commander\r\nof a concentration camp operated by the Bosnian Serbs\r\nwith murder, torture and mutilation of Muslim prisoners.\r\nWe express the hope that in the coming weeks and\r\nmonths the Prosecutor will issue further indictments for\r\nreview by judges. The Office of the Prosecutor must be\r\nfully staffed and equipped with all the necessary\r\ninfrastructure and modern technology to ensure its smooth\r\nand efficient functioning.\r\nThe Tribunal must also establish a liaison office in\r\nSarajevo in order to coordinate its work with the\r\nauthorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In order to\r\naccomplish its mission of rendering justice expeditiously,\r\nthe Tribunal will need the continued cooperation of the\r\nStates Members of the United Nations. We appeal to the\r\ninternational community, particularly the affluent States,\r\nto come forward with material and financial assistance to\r\nthe budget of the International Tribunal.\r\nThe establishment of the Tribunal is of enormous\r\nsignificance for the world community, as this institution\r\nis called upon not only to vindicate and enforce the\r\nabiding demands of justice and humanity, but also to\r\nserve as a warning against any future perpetrators of\r\ncrimes against humanity. My delegation is confident that,\r\nwith the political, material and financial support of the\r\ninternational community, the Tribunal will be able to\r\ncarry out its task in an effective and impartial manner and\r\nthus open a new path towards the realization of true\r\ninternational peace and justice.\r\nThe rendering of justice by the International Tribunal\r\nwill help to restore humane and peaceful conditions in the\r\nwar-torn former Yugoslavia and to alleviate the anguish\r\nand grief of those who have suffered and who continue to\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nbe victims of armed violence and brutality. The example set\r\nin the former Yugoslavia will also serve as a warning to\r\nother regions where innocent peoples are being subjected to\r\nthe use of force, brutalities and atrocities, in breach of the\r\nnorms of international humanitarian law.\r\nMr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): At\r\nthe outset, I should like to extend my thanks to\r\nMr. Antonio Cassese, President of the International\r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since\r\n1991. We thank him for the lucid and comprehensive\r\nstatement he made this morning and assure him that the\r\ndelegation of Egypt fully understands the nature and\r\ndimensions of the problems he referred to in his statement.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 808 (1993) established the\r\nInternational Tribunal. That was a serious step in the right\r\ndirection towards putting an end to the human tragedy\r\nendured by that region as a result of the military conflict\r\nand its attendant heinous racial practices, in particular the\r\npolicy of “ethnic cleansing”, which is, without a doubt, a\r\nform of genocide. The Tribunal is unique in modern\r\nhistory. It is the first international criminal tribunal ever to\r\nbe established by the United Nations and differs in its\r\nmission, nature and historical circumstances from the two\r\ninternational military tribunals established in Nuremberg\r\nand Tokyo.\r\nThe inhuman practices witnessed in the former\r\nYugoslavia make it very important to expedite the\r\nprosecution of the perpetrators of war crimes and grave\r\nbreaches of international humanitarian law. Thus, the\r\nTribunal should take expeditious measures, as the\r\ntraditional approach could lead to more waste of time, and\r\nthereby complicate further the prosecution process.\r\nThe delegation of Egypt fully supports the objective\r\nrequirement which the President of the Tribunal clearly\r\nenunciated in his statement, namely the need to provide the\r\nfinancial resources that are necessary for the Tribunal. We\r\ncall upon the General Assembly to approve the allocation\r\nof the necessary resources for the Tribunal’s work through\r\nthe regular budget of the United Nations on an urgent\r\npriority basis. This is particularly necessary in the light of\r\nthe Tribunal President’s statement that, starting from March\r\n1995, the Tribunal will be in constant, year-round session.\r\nThe Trial and Appeals Chambers will be rotating morning\r\nand afternoon in their procedures. In this connection, the\r\nprovisional budget under which the Tribunal is currently\r\nworking is neither sufficient nor guaranteed to continue.\r\nThis is a situation that endangers the Tribunal’s structure\r\nwith regard to the recruitment of the necessary staff and\r\nimpedes the provision of the services needed for the\r\nTribunal to perform its work.\r\nThe delegation of Egypt expresses its deepest\r\nappreciation to the Tribunal. We also commend the\r\nserious initiative of the Tribunal, as made clear earlier by\r\nthe President of the Tribunal, namely that, despite the\r\nlack of resources, the Judges proceeded with their serious\r\ntask of adopting the rules of procedure, detention of the\r\naccused and rules of evidence. My delegation also wishes\r\nto commend and pay tribute to the serious steps and\r\nefforts taken by the Prosecutor, Mr. Goldstone, to initiate\r\nthe prosecution proceedings and the issuance of the first\r\nindictment early this month. On this occasion, we also\r\npay tribute to the cooperation with the Tribunal of the\r\nhost country, the Netherlands.\r\nThe delegation of Egypt underscores the need to\r\nensure the safety of and provide protection for the\r\nwitnesses who testify before the Tribunal and provide the\r\nevidence whereby it may reach its verdict. It is also\r\nimportant to ensure the full cooperation of States and of\r\ninternational judicial organizations with the Tribunal and\r\nits organs as such cooperation is essential to make\r\npossible the taking of necessary steps within the\r\nframework of the domestic laws of States in enforcing the\r\njudgements of the International Tribunal and ensure\r\ncompliance with requests for assistance or orders made by\r\none of the Tribunal’s chambers.\r\nIn this connection, it is important to refer to the\r\nstipulation in the Statute, which states that the\r\nInternational Tribunal shall have primacy over national\r\ncourts and prevails over all legal impediments obstructing\r\nthe extradition or transfer of the accused to the Tribunal.\r\nWhile considering the Tribunal’s report it is\r\nimportant to refer to the Commission of Experts\r\nestablished by the Security Council prior to the\r\nestablishment of the Tribunal. The Commission has\r\neffectively concluded its work and investigations into the\r\nwar crimes as well as the serious breaches of international\r\nhumanitarian law in Yugoslavia. It is also important to\r\nrefer to the importance of the Commission’s report and to\r\nnote that it will be issued as an official Security Council\r\nand General Assembly document. That report is an\r\nimportant document that will assist the Tribunal in its\r\ninvestigation of a number of the crimes committed,\r\nnamely, rape, torture, maiming and killing, in addition to\r\nother acts of intolerable or degrading treatment.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nThe delegation of Egypt has perused with interest the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/49/342), which includes\r\nthe annual report of the International Tribunal transmitted\r\nto the Security Council and the General Assembly. My\r\ndelegation fully supports the contents of the report and\r\nconcurs with the concluding observations, which state:\r\n“The establishment of the Tribunal may\r\nconstitute a turning-point in the world community. If\r\nthe Tribunal proves that it can work in an effective\r\nand dispassionate way and the necessary cooperation\r\nof all States and United Nations bodies is forthcoming,\r\nit may open a new path towards the realization of true\r\ninternational justice, and hence of peace, in the world\r\ncommunity.” (A/49/342, para. 197)\r\nMr. Ismail (Malaysia): Just a few minutes ago,\r\nMr. Antonio Cassese, President of the international criminal\r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia, made an incisive and\r\nthought-provoking statement to the Assembly. He very\r\naptly observed that we as Member States have\r\n“decided that the United Nations should broaden its\r\narsenal of pacific means to include resort to\r\ninternational criminal justice, as a lawful response to\r\nforce and violence.” (supra, p. 5)\r\nIt is true that we the Members of the Assembly have\r\ndecided that the world community would not stand idly by\r\nimpassively watching the perpetrators of barbarous acts\r\nbrutalizing fellow human beings. Massacre, rape, “ethnic\r\ncleansing,” the wanton killing of civilians affect all of us\r\nirrespective of our creed, race, religion or place of abode.\r\nThey undermine fundamental values and the greatest\r\nprinciples of all civilizations.\r\nOur deliberations here today must contribute to the\r\nwork of this Tribunal, which seeks to alleviate the anguish\r\nand sorrow of all who have suffered, and continue to suffer,\r\nfrom aggression and “ethnic cleansing” in the former\r\nYugoslavia. The Tribunal represents the will of the\r\ncommunity to bring the perpetrators of crimes against\r\nhumanity to justice. It can help dissolve the poisonous\r\nfumes of resentment and suspicion, and put to rest the lust\r\nfor revenge.\r\nThe International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, a\r\nforerunner in many ways of the Tribunal on former\r\nYugoslavia, had the benefit of the full support of the victors\r\nof the Second World War. The Tribunal on former\r\nYugoslavia remains confronted with a range of issues, both\r\norganizational and substantive. These issues have been\r\npointed out by Mr. Cassese in his statement, as well as in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General in document A/49/342.\r\nMy delegation is concerned over the practical,\r\nfinancial and structural difficulties confronting the\r\nTribunal, particularly in the first few months of its\r\nexistence. We note that, owing to the shortage of financial\r\nresources, the Tribunal has not been able to recruit\r\nexperienced staff and personnel other than on short-term\r\ncontracts, thus restricting the choice considerably and\r\nhampering its work. The report further discloses that\r\neven the judges are still being paid on an ad hoc basis.\r\nWhile we note that some of these problems have been\r\naddressed, we firmly believe that the work of the Tribunal\r\nshould not be made hostage to the availability of\r\nresources. In this regard, Malaysia has contributed $2\r\nmillion for the work of the Tribunal. We call on all\r\nMember States to ensure that the Tribunal is adequately\r\nfunded to ensure that it completes its work.\r\nWe regret the unfortunate turn of events that led to\r\nthe withdrawal of the prosecutor-designate in February\r\n1994 and the ensuing five-month delay in appointing his\r\nsuccessor. This was a major blow to the Tribunal. The\r\nOffice of the Prosecutor, which is responsible for the\r\ninitiation and conduct of investigations and prosecutions,\r\nhas been handicapped by the long delay in the\r\nappointment of the Prosecutor. My delegation therefore\r\nwelcomed the appointment of the Honourable Richard\r\nGoldstone as Prosecutor in July 1994. This means that the\r\nfinal key element of the Tribunal’s structure is now in\r\nplace.\r\nMalaysia is also concerned about the problems\r\nrelated to staffing in the Office of the Prosecutor. The\r\nsuccess of the Tribunal as a whole depends very much on\r\nthe calibre of the investigative staff of the Office of the\r\nProsecutor. Obviously, if the prosecution’s case is not\r\nthorough and complete, or is insufficiently prepared, the\r\nrisk of the failure of prosecution is high. One of the\r\nmajor reasons for the delay in recruiting staff has been\r\nidentified as the lack of a long-term budget commitment\r\nfor the Tribunal and the consequent inability on its part to\r\noffer long-term contracts of employment to potential staff.\r\nWe need to address these shortcomings urgently in order\r\nto overcome the problems encountered by the Office of\r\nthe Prosecutor. My delegation looks forward to their early\r\nsolution in the Fifth Committee.\r\nTo ensure the success of the Tribunal, my delegation\r\nwishes to stress how important it is that all States\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\ncooperate with it. This is particularly so since the Tribunal\r\nlacks any direct authority over the territories of the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations and, in particular, of the\r\nsuccessor Republics of the former Yugoslavia. The Tribunal\r\nmust rely upon national legal systems and the enforcement\r\nmachinery of each State to fulfil some of its tasks,\r\nincluding investigations, the subpoenaing of witnesses and\r\nthe service of arrest warrants in the territories of United\r\nNations Member States. In order to comply with this\r\nobligation, all States would need to enact implementing\r\nlegislation designed to bring their municipal laws in line\r\nwith the requirements of the statute.\r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that Malaysia\r\nhas taken steps to enact legislation in this regard, and we\r\ncall upon other States to do likewise. Malaysia is also\r\nassisting the Prosecutor of the international Tribunal for the\r\nformer Yugoslavia to interview Bosnian witnesses who are\r\ncurrently residing in Malaysia. An investigation team from\r\nthe Tribunal should be visiting Malaysia soon to undertake\r\nthis task.\r\nMy delegation believes that non-governmental\r\norganizations could assist in the work of the Tribunal. One\r\narea where non-governmental organizations can be of\r\nimmediate assistance is in the provision of information.\r\nThose organizations can be invaluable in providing\r\ninformation regarding incidents that fall within the\r\njurisdiction of the Tribunal, tracing witnesses and, where\r\npossible, providing direct evidence for the use of the\r\nProsecutor. Furthermore, non-governmental organizations\r\ncould also assist in the provision of support for victims and\r\nwitnesses. More specifically, they could provide\r\npsychological and practical support to victims and witnesses\r\nboth before and after trials.\r\nThe credibility and effectiveness of the Tribunal will\r\nbe judged by its actions. In this regard we note that the\r\nProsecutor’s Office is investigating 12 cases involving\r\nmultiple suspects. We are confident that the early\r\nprosecution of the war criminals would have a deterrent\r\neffect on further acts of genocide, in all parts of the world.\r\nCriminals cannot go unpunished nor victims be denied\r\njustice.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran): Since the\r\nbeginning of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, numerous\r\ncrimes against humanity have been committed. During the\r\nlast three years, the genocidal practice of “ethnic\r\ncleansing”, involving murder, rape, torture and other\r\ninhuman treatment of Bosnian Muslims, perpetrated by the\r\nSerbs, has been wounding the conscience of the whole\r\nworld.\r\nSince the start of Serbian aggression against Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, many resolutions have been adopted by\r\nthe Security Council calling for the cessation of hostilities\r\nand the termination of aggression, as well as for a halt to\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law, including\r\n“ethnic cleansing”. All these calls have been ignored by\r\nthe Serbs, and the crimes and atrocities against innocent\r\nBosnians are continuing at this very hour. Had the\r\nSecurity Council in fact reacted decisively when its first\r\nresolution was violated by the Serbs, the situation of so\r\nmany Bosnian Muslims would have been different and\r\nmany lives could have been saved.\r\nThe magnitude of these Serbian violations of\r\ninternational law has been so enormous that in February\r\n1993 certain members of the Security Council finally\r\nagreed not to oppose the establishment of a tribunal\r\nspecifically for trying those responsible for war crimes.\r\nThe setting up of a tribunal to act effectively and\r\nexpeditiously, rather than relying on the traditional\r\napproach of establishing such a body by treaty, which\r\ntakes many years to reach full ratification, was\r\nnecessitated by the fact that the case of former\r\nYugoslavia, particularly the case of the Bosnian Muslims,\r\nwas exceptional, indeed unique, and required immediate\r\naction.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has always called for\r\nthe adoption of effective measures against the Serbian\r\naggressors, for the lifting of the unjust arms embargo\r\nagainst Bosnia and Herzegovina and for the trying of\r\nthose responsible for crimes in former Yugoslavia,\r\nparticularly in Bosnia. In this regard, we welcomed the\r\nestablishment of the Tribunal and expressed our desire for\r\nfull cooperation in the implementation of its\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nThe delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran has\r\nstudied with great interest the first annual report,\r\ncontained in document A/49/342, of the International\r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\r\nsince 1991. One of the problems the Tribunal faced at the\r\nbeginning of its work was the absence of a Prosecutor. It\r\nis regrettable that it took so long for the Security Council\r\nto appoint a Prosecutor. The Council, in its resolution\r\n827 (1993), stated that the establishment of the Tribunal\r\nwould\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\n“contribute to ensuring that such violations are halted\r\nand effectively redressed”. (Security Council\r\nresolution 827 (1993), seventh preambular paragraph)\r\nIf one of the principal objectives of the Tribunal is to deter\r\nfurther violation of international humanitarian law, how can\r\nthis long delay in appointing a Prosecutor be justified in the\r\nface of continued Serbian aggression and violation of\r\ninternational law? As the report of the Tribunal indicates,\r\n“The unfortunate turn of events whereby the\r\nProsecutor-designate withdrew in February, and the\r\nensuing five-month delay in appointing his successor\r\nwas a major blow to the Tribunal.” (A/49/342,\r\npara. 37)\r\nIt is a matter of satisfaction that practical and financial\r\nproblems facing the Tribunal have been largely solved and\r\nthat delays that had been hampering the work of the\r\nTribunal have now been overcome. Last week, the Tribunal\r\nissued its first indictment, against the former Serbian\r\ncommander of a concentration camp, who was charged with\r\nmurder, torture and mutilation of Muslim prisoners. This is\r\na welcome development that should be followed by\r\nbringing to justice others responsible for war crimes,\r\nespecially those in command who plan or order large-scale\r\nbreaches of international humanitarian law. In this regard,\r\nmy delegation welcomes the assertion in the report that\r\n“the Tribunal will proceed against any person,\r\nregardless of status and rank, against whom the\r\nProsecutor has issued an indictment confirmed by a\r\njudge of the Tribunal.” (ibid., para. 49)\r\nThe Tribunal should not only bring war criminals to justice;\r\nit should complete its task regardless of the status of\r\npolitical negotiations or the military situation. The Tribunal\r\nwill act as a powerful deterrent to all if, and only if, it\r\nimplements its mandate totally.\r\nIn conclusion, the Islamic Republic of Iran stands\r\nready to cooperate with the Tribunal in fulfilling its worthy\r\ntask. It is incumbent upon all Member States to resolve all\r\nproblems that lie outside the Tribunal’s power, including\r\nthe financial problems, so as to enable the Tribunal to\r\ncomplete its mission and bring to justice all those\r\nresponsible for “ethnic cleansing”, genocide, rape, torture,\r\nwanton destruction of property, and all other barbarous acts.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): At the outset, allow me to\r\nexpress the gratitude of the Government of the Republic of\r\nCroatia to Mr. Antonio Cassese, President of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991, for the comprehensive\r\nreport he has submitted to the General Assembly, which\r\nwill serve as a valuable basis for informed discussion and\r\nfuture action on this matter.\r\nCroatia has on numerous occasions expressed its\r\nsupport for the establishment of the international Tribunal\r\nand understands its obligations in the event that the\r\nTribunal should succeed in prosecuting those who are\r\nguilty of committing war crimes and crimes against\r\nhumanity on the territory of the former Yugoslavia since\r\n1991. We fully share the opinion expressed in the annual\r\nreport concerning the need for such a tribunal in order not\r\nonly to dispense justice but also to deter further crimes\r\nand to contribute to the restoration and maintenance of\r\npeace. It is necessary to bring war criminals and those\r\nwho have violated humanitarian law to justice in order for\r\nreconciliation and confidence-building to occur, thus\r\ncreating conditions for a just and lasting peace.\r\nIt is especially important to ensure that responsibility\r\nfor the odious crimes that have been committed in the\r\nRepublic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is attributed to the initiators, perpetrators and\r\norganizers, and not to entire national groups. That will\r\nprevent the assignment of collective responsibility to\r\ncertain peoples and thereby avoid a development which\r\ncould have negative consequences for future bilateral and\r\nmultilateral relations and peace in the region.\r\nIn this regard, my Government views with favour\r\nthe possibility of the establishment of a permanent\r\ninternational tribunal designed to deal with war crimes\r\nand violations of humanitarian law wherever they may\r\noccur.\r\nMy Government agrees with the position of the\r\nPresident of the International Tribunal, as stated in the\r\nreport, that the establishment of this international body\r\nthrough the exercise of the special powers of the Security\r\nCouncil under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United\r\nNations was more rapid than establishment through an\r\ninternational treaty. However, we are of the opinion that\r\nthe work of the International Tribunal has been\r\nproceeding too slowly, largely due to insufficient\r\nsupport — particularly political support — by influential\r\nmembers of the international community.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nLikewise, we wish to stress that there has been\r\ninsufficient financial support for the work of the Tribunal.\r\nIn this regard, we cannot but express our dismay that the\r\noverwhelming majority of the financial contributions in\r\nsupport of the Tribunal have come from the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia is concerned at various\r\nstatements by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia\r\nand Montenegro) that indicate its unwillingness to cooperate\r\nwith the Tribunal, especially regarding the extradition of\r\nsuspected war criminals. We are afraid that this might have\r\nan extremely negative impact on the effectiveness of the\r\nwork of the Tribunal.\r\nIt must be noted that this represents a continuing\r\npattern of refusal by the Serbian side to cooperate with the\r\ninternational community. Their refusal to allow for an\r\ninternational investigation of the various mass grave sites in\r\nthe occupied territories of Croatia — and particularly of the\r\nOvcara mass grave near the Croatian city of Vukovar — is\r\nextremely disturbing to Croatia and clearly indicates that\r\nthe Serbian side continues to obstruct the noble path of\r\nlegal justice.\r\nIf a situation were to occur whereby those in Serbia\r\nwho committed the grave crimes mentioned earlier were not\r\nto be tried, this would represent a miscarriage of justice and\r\nwould undermine the very credibility of the international\r\nTribunal as well as its legal and moral authority. It would\r\nnegate the very purpose of the Tribunal’s establishment,\r\nand it would send completely the wrong message to present\r\nand potential war criminals and to those who might commit\r\naggression and genocide in the future.\r\nWe wish further to state that since, according to the\r\nfindings of the Commission of Experts, there was no\r\nequivalence of guilt, there can be no equal “balance”\r\nbetween the number of those from each side who are\r\ncharged with war crimes. Furthermore, there can be no\r\nequivalence of the charges to be presented against those\r\nrepresenting the side that planned, orchestrated and\r\nexecuted the aggression and genocide and those\r\nrepresenting the sides that were victimized by that policy.\r\nThe aggressors must not be equated with the victims of\r\naggression.\r\nIn this connection, I should like to recall the various\r\nreports of Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Special Rapporteur for\r\nthe former Yugoslavia of the Commission on Human\r\nRights and the final report of the Commission of Experts\r\npursuant to Security Council resolution 780 (1992), in\r\nwhich it is stated that\r\n“there is no factual basis for arguing that there is a\r\nmoral equivalence\u0027 between the warring factions”.\r\n(S/1994/674, para. 149)\r\nIn order to induce the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to cooperate with\r\nthe international Tribunal, it may be necessary to link its\r\ncooperation with the easing of the sanctions that have\r\nbeen imposed on it, or to impose stricter sanctions if that\r\nState still refuses to comply.\r\nIn closing, we wish to reiterate our conviction that\r\nthe international Tribunal is a necessary factor in the\r\nestablishment of a just and lasting peace in our region.\r\nFor that reason, we stress the necessity for all States to\r\ncomply with the Security Council and cooperate with the\r\nTribunal.\r\nMr. Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina): We are\r\npleased to have the opportunity to review the efforts made\r\nso far by the international war crimes Tribunal and to\r\nreinvigorate the support for the Tribunal’s work. We look\r\nforward to such future opportunities on a regular basis.\r\nAs for now, we must emphasize our satisfaction that the\r\nTribunal is finally functioning after some unexpected, and\r\nat times unexplained, delays.\r\nWe now must place our full confidence in the Office\r\nof the Prosecutor and in Judge Goldstone’s commitment\r\nto an effort not to be diminished or undermined by\r\npolitical considerations. We are confident that Judge\r\nGoldstone, the Prosecutor’s staff, the investigators, the\r\nRegistrar, and, of course, the judges of the Tribunal share\r\nthe view that the efficacious prosecution of war criminals,\r\nfrom whatever military or political ranks they may come,\r\nwill make a positive, rather than negative, contribution to\r\nthe peace effort.\r\nPolitical expediency cannot be the basis for justice,\r\nand injustice cannot be the basis for a durable peace.\r\nWe would look for the Office of the Prosecutor to\r\nbe vigilant in identifying and, if necessary, disclosing\r\nattempts to destabilize and undermine the Tribunal’s\r\nwork.\r\nDespite our current confidence in the undertakings\r\nof the Tribunal and the Office of the Prosecutor, certain\r\nconsiderations concern us today:\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nFirst, the Tribunal will be in a position to address only\r\na handful of the many of thousands of potential cases. As\r\na consequence, the Tribunal, along with the international\r\ncommunity, must endeavour to assist national courts,\r\nincluding those of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nin bringing the war criminals to justice.\r\nIn this context, we are most supportive of the\r\nTribunal’s and the Prosecutor’s commitment to establish\r\nliaison offices, including one in our capital, Sarajevo.\r\nWe also hope that the Tribunal’s capacity limitation\r\nwill not heighten attempts to project equivalence. Although\r\nthe criminal acts may not be limited to just one side, only\r\none side has made these crimes a tool of its military and\r\npolitical agenda.\r\nFor our part, the civilian and military courts of the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina have already brought\r\nto justice — and will continue to do so — not only Serbian\r\nparamilitary forces but others, including people of Bosniac\r\nethnicity, for criminal acts committed against any citizen.\r\nWe are proud of, and remain dedicated to, the\r\nimpartiality of our justice system. At the same time, the\r\nTribunal and those who truly support its efforts must\r\nremain cognizant that it is the Serbian side — not the\r\nethnic group, but the political leadership of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro and its surrogates in the Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina — that is responsible not only for\r\nnumerous individual criminal actions but also for a\r\nsystematic campaign that constitutes the most blatant\r\nviolation of the Geneva Conventions and of the Convention\r\non the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of\r\nGenocide.\r\nIn this context, we remain concerned at the fact that\r\nthe Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\n(Serbia and Montenegro) has continued to assert that it will\r\nnot cooperate with the Tribunal and the Office of the\r\nProsecutor.\r\nThe Security Council must ensure the readiness of the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia to cooperate with the\r\nTribunal and the Office of the Prosecutor before any further\r\nrehabilitation or easing of sanctions is even considered. The\r\nTribunal and the Office of the Prosecutor are totally reliant\r\nupon the will of, and on the mechanisms available to, the\r\nSecurity Council in seeking the cooperation of the various\r\nnations involved.\r\nEasing the sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro\r\nwould be unseemly and counter-productive at any time in\r\nthe future if the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia\r\nand Montenegro) continues to be uncooperative.\r\nOtherwise, the Security Council in effect would be\r\nundermining the efforts of the very institution it has\r\nestablished as a key to not only justice but also peace.\r\nIn line with General Assembly resolution 49/10, we\r\nonce again re-emphasize the call for material assistance\r\nto the Tribunal’s work and thank those who have already\r\nprovided resources, including the home for the Tribunal\r\nin The Hague.\r\nWe would also be remiss if we did not once again\r\nexpress our gratitude for the efforts of the war crimes\r\nCommission, as both the predecessor of the Tribunal and\r\nas an institution that has contributed on its own. We\r\nbelieve that the Commission, under Cherif Bassiouni’s\r\nleadership, will uniquely contribute to the understanding\r\nof the systematic criminal campaign and genocide\r\ncommitted against the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and its people.\r\nFinally, we ask the international community, and\r\nespecially the Security Council, to remain available to\r\nadjust the mandate and tools necessary for the Tribunal\r\nand Prosecutor’s Office in pursuit of their respective\r\nagendas. We share the concerns of many, including the\r\nGovernment of Rwanda, that expectations of the Tribunal\r\nare very high while the necessary tools and criminal\r\nremedies available to it are limited and potentially\r\ninadequate, in view of the scope as well as the severity of\r\nthe crimes.\r\nWe took particular note of the statement of Judge\r\nAntonio Cassese, President of the international war crimes\r\nTribunal on the former Yugoslavia. We wholeheartedly\r\nagree that the Tribunal’s efforts, in Freud’s terminology,\r\nare a “palliative device”. The Tribunal cannot be a\r\nsubstitute for confronting war criminals and for\r\npeacemaking, but must supplement such efforts as the\r\nfinal act of peacemaking. However, these shortcomings\r\nare not reflective of the Tribunal and its participants;\r\nrather, they reflect the inadequate political and military\r\nresponse of the Powers that could confront the very\r\ncriminals the Tribunal seeks to bring to justice.\r\nNow let us offer our sincere support for the efforts\r\nof the Tribunal.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker on this\r\nitem. May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 149?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 17\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and\r\nother appointments: reports of the Fifth Committee\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): If there\r\nis no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I\r\nshall take it that the General Assembly decides not to\r\ndiscuss the reports of the Fifth Committee which are before\r\nit today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): Before\r\nwe begin to take action on the recommendations contained\r\nin the reports of the Fifth Committee, I should like to\r\nadvise representatives that we shall proceed to take\r\ndecisions in the same manner as was done in the Fifth\r\nCommittee.\r\n(a) Appointment of members of the Advisory\r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions: report of the Fifth Committee (Parts II\r\nand III) (A/49/432/Add.1 and 2)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The Fifth\r\nCommittee recommends in paragraph 9 of part II of its\r\nreport that the General Assembly should appoint the\r\nfollowing persons as members of the Advisory Committee\r\non Administrative and Budgetary Questions for a three-year\r\nterm of office beginning on 1 January 1995: Mr. Ahmad\r\nFathi Al-Masri, Mr. Ioan Barac, Mr. Mahamane Maiga,\r\nMr. E. Besley Maycock and Mr. C. S. M. Mselle.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly appoints those\r\npersons?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The Fifth\r\nCommittee recommends in paragraph 4 of part III of its\r\nreport that the General Assembly should appoint\r\nMrs. Norma Goicochea Estenoz as a member of the\r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions for a term of office beginning on 14 November\r\n1994 and ending on 31 December 1996.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to appoint\r\nMrs. Norma Goicochea Estenoz as a member of the\r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions for a term of office beginning on 14 November\r\n1994 and ending on 31 December 1996?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(b) Appointment of members of the Committee on\r\nContributions: report of the Fifth Committee\r\n(A/49/657)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\nparagraph 8 of its report, the Fifth Committee\r\nrecommends that the General Assembly should appoint\r\nthe following persons as members of the Committee on\r\nContributions for a three-year term of office beginning on\r\n1 January 1995: Mr. Uldis Blukis, Mr. David Etuket,\r\nMr. Igor V. Goumenny, Mr. William Grant, Mr. Masao\r\nKawai, Mr. Vanu Gopala Menon.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nappoint those persons?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(c) Appointment of a member of the Board of\r\nAuditors: report of the Fifth Committee\r\n(A/49/658)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\nparagraph 4 of its report, the Fifth Committee\r\nrecommends that the General Assembly should appoint\r\nthe Comptroller and Auditor-General of the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a\r\nmember of the United Nations Board of Auditors for a\r\nthree-year term of office beginning on 1 July 1995.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to appoint\r\nthis person?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(d) Confirmation of the appointment of members of\r\nthe Investments Committee: report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee (A/49/659)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nFifth Committee recommends in paragraph 4 of its report\r\nthat the General Assembly should confirm the\r\nappointment by the Secretary-General of the following\r\npersons as members of the Investments Committee for a\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nthree-year term of office beginning on 1 January 1995:\r\nMr. Ahmad Abdullatif, Mr. Aloysio de Andrade Faria and\r\nMr. Stanislaw Raczkowski.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconfirm the appointment of these persons?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(e) Appointment of members of the United Nations\r\nAdministrative Tribunal: report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee (A/49/660)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\nparagraph 4 of its report, the Fifth Committee recommends\r\nthat the General Assembly should appoint the following\r\npersons as members of the United Nations Administrative\r\nTribunal for a three-year term of office beginning on\r\n1 January 1995: Mr. Balanda Mikuin Leliel,\r\nMr. Samarendra Sen and Mr. Hubert Thierry.\r\nMay I consider that the Assembly appoints those\r\npersons?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(f) International Civil Service Commission: report of\r\nthe Fifth Committee (A/49/661)\r\n(i) Appointment of members of the Commission\r\n(ii) Designation of the Chairman and Vice-\r\nChairman of the Commission\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\nparagraph 8 of its report, the Fifth Committee recommends\r\nthat the General Assembly should appoint the following\r\npersons as members of the International Civil Service\r\nCommission for a four-year term of office beginning on\r\n1 January 1995: Mr. Mohsen Bel Hadj Amor, Mrs. Turkia\r\nDaddah, Mr. André Xavier Pirson, Mr. Jaroslav Riha and\r\nMr. Carlos S. Vegega.\r\nMay I consider that the General Assembly appoints\r\nthese persons?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In the\r\nsame paragraph, the Fifth Committee recommends that the\r\nAssembly designate Mr. Mohsen Bel Hadj Amor as\r\nChairman and Mr. Carlos Vegega as Vice-Chairman of the\r\nCommission for a four-year term of office beginning on\r\n1 January 1995.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly designates these\r\npersons as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the\r\nCommission?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(g) Appointment of members and alternate members\r\nof the United Nations Staff Pension Committee:\r\nreport of the Fifth Committee (A/49/656)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\nparagraph 5 of its report, the Fifth Committee\r\nrecommends that the General Assembly should appoint\r\nthe following persons as members of the United Nations\r\nStaff Pension Committee for a three-year term of office\r\nbeginning on 1 January 1995: Mr. Tadanori Inomata,\r\nMr. Vladimir V. Kuznetsov, Mr. Philip Richard Okanda\r\nOwade, Ms. Susan Shearouse, Mr. Clive Stitt and Mr. M.\r\nEl Hassane Zahid.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly appoints\r\nthese persons?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): May I\r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of sub-items (a), (b), (c), (d),\r\n(e), (f) and (g) of agenda item 17.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work:\r\nreports of the General Committee\r\nFourth report of the General Committee\r\n(A/49/250/Add.3)\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nfourth report of the General Committee concerns a request\r\nby a number of countries for the inclusion in the agenda of\r\nthe current session of an additional item entitled “Capital\r\npunishment”.\r\nThe General Committee decided to recommend to the\r\nGeneral Assembly that the item should be included in the\r\nagenda.\r\nIn accordance with rule 23 of the rules of procedure,\r\n“Debate on the inclusion of an item in the agenda,\r\nwhen that item has been recommended for inclusion\r\nby the General Committee, shall be limited to three\r\nspeakers in favour of, and three speakers against, the\r\ninclusion.”\r\nMr. Ferrarin (Italy): The General Assembly is called\r\nupon today to take a decision on the inclusion in its agenda\r\nof an additional item entitled “Capital punishment”. The\r\nrequest for such inclusion was signed by 34 countries,\r\nincluding Italy.\r\nOn 7 November 1994, the General Committee decided\r\nto recommend to the General Assembly that the item\r\nshould be included in the agenda and should be allocated to\r\nthe Third Committee as sub-item (e) of agenda item 100,\r\nentitled “Human rights questions”.\r\nWe have already had the opportunity to explain why\r\nItaly is leading this initiative, which is not intended to add\r\nfuel to the fire on a very controversial issue, but only to\r\ngive Member States the opportunity to have a debate on it.\r\nFirst, my country’s Parliament has passed a motion\r\nmandating the Government to submit a request for the\r\ninclusion of the item in the agenda of the current session of\r\nthe General Assembly. This decision reflects the sentiments\r\nof the overwhelming majority of the Italian people.\r\nSecondly, other initiatives have emphasized the death\r\npenalty issue, such as the resolution adopted by the\r\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on\r\n4 October 1994, in which all States that have not yet\r\nabolished capital punishment are asked to do so.\r\nThirdly, on 21 September 1994, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations sent a letter urging the\r\ncountries that had not yet done so to ratify the second\r\nUnited Nations optional protocol aiming at the abolition\r\nof the death penalty. On 26 October 1994, the second\r\noptional protocol was approved by the Italian Chamber of\r\nDeputies and has been sent to the Senate for final\r\napproval in the next few days. Furthermore, my country\r\nhas just abolished the death penalty also for crimes\r\ncommitted in wartime under military law.\r\nI should like to add some remarks on the point of\r\nthe allocation of the item. We have already agreed in the\r\nGeneral Committee, in a spirit of compromise, to scale\r\ndown the question of putting capital punishment on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly from an item to a sub-\r\nitem, sub-item (e) of the existing item 100, entitled\r\n“Human rights questions”, and allocate it to the Third\r\nCommittee.\r\nWe were and are unable, much to our regret, to\r\nmake further concessions. In particular, we cannot accept\r\nthe allocation of the question to the Sixth Committee\r\nrather than to the Third. This is so for a number of\r\nreasons which we have already explained but which I\r\nwould like to repeat.\r\nFirst, in the United Nations from the very beginning\r\ncapital punishment has been debated by the Third\r\nCommittee as a human rights issue. It would be extremely\r\ndifficult to explain to our Parliament and to our public\r\nopinion why the matter should be treated in a different\r\nframework and by a different body, especially if one\r\nconsiders that even the second optional protocol, aimed at\r\nthe abolition of the death penalty, was drafted in the\r\nThird Committee and not in the Sixth Committee.\r\nSecondly, if we allocate the question to the Sixth\r\nCommittee we would have to add a separate item to the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s agenda, which would reopen the\r\nproblem that the compromise on the sub-item was\r\nintended to solve — that is to say, the problem of not\r\noverburdening that agenda.\r\nThirdly, it is an established practice of the Sixth\r\nCommittee to finish its work by the week of\r\nThanksgiving — that is to say, less than a week from\r\nnow. There would hardly be enough time for the 34\r\ncountries that are requesting the inclusion of the item in\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nthe agenda, and for others, to express their views on such\r\nan important matter fully and thoroughly, since the Sixth\r\nCommittee’s calendar is already rather overburdened. The\r\nalternative to a very short and compressed debate would be\r\nto refer the item to next year, which we cannot accept.\r\nFor all those reasons, I am confident that the General\r\nAssembly will follow the recommendations of the General\r\nCommittee and decide to include “Capital punishment” in\r\nits agenda as sub-item (e) of agenda item 100 and to\r\nallocate it to the Third Committee. We hope that this\r\ndecision will be taken by consensus. If, however, a vote is\r\nrequested, I should like to ask all delegations to vote in\r\nfavour of the inclusion of the item on the agenda and of its\r\nallocation to the Third Committee.\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra): As I stated in the\r\nGeneral Committee, for centuries the Principality of\r\nAndorra has taken a particular interest in matters relating to\r\nthe dignity of the human being in all its forms. While the\r\ndeath penalty was in existence, the Andorran people were\r\nalways deeply affected when it was applied. A French\r\nweekly noted this about Andorra in 1846:\r\n(spoke in French)\r\n“The memory of a death sentence passed in the\r\nseventeenth century still today fills the people with\r\ndread.”\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nPerhaps the fact that Andorra has been blessed by decades\r\nof a low rate of criminality has allowed us to distance\r\nourselves from the notion of capital punishment. Perhaps\r\nthe small size of our community has made us very\r\nappreciative of the value of human life.\r\nThe last sentence to death in our country was carried\r\nout in 1945. It caused great consternation and deep\r\nsociological shock, which our writers have reflected upon\r\nin the decades following the event. Finally, having died\r\nfrom non-use, the death penalty was abolished formally in\r\n1990.\r\nTrue to the deep-rooted principles of their political\r\nphilosophy, the citizens of Andorra, in the exercise of their\r\nsovereignty, enshrined their commitment against the death\r\npenalty in the Constitution of 1993. Article 8 states:\r\n“1. The Constitution recognizes the right to life and\r\nfully protects it in its different phases.\r\n“2. All persons have the right to physical and\r\nmoral integrity. No one shall be subjected to torture\r\nor to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or\r\npunishment.\r\n“3. The death penalty is prohibited.”\r\nThe death penalty is of primordial concern to our\r\npeople. Therefore it is only natural that we signed the\r\nrequest to the General Committee in document A/49/234,\r\nof 25 October 1994, and its addendum.\r\nBut the death penalty is also the concern of a larger\r\nbody of people. Last Friday my country joined the\r\nCouncil of Europe, the parliamentary assembly of which,\r\non 4 October 1994, adopted a resolution advocating the\r\nabolition of capital punishment.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAt this end of the second millennium of our era it\r\nwould appear that the peoples of the world, ever-more-\r\ntightly bound by a system of world-wide trade and\r\ncultural exchanges, have increasingly embraced the\r\nphilosophy of tolerance, respect for human rights, peace\r\ninstead of war, and life instead of death.\r\nThe debate on capital punishment is therefore clearly\r\npart of this world-wide debate on the dignity of the\r\nhuman being. The United Nations, as the forum for\r\nrational dialogue par excellence, is the ideal place to\r\nexchange views on the question before us.\r\nThat is why the Principality of Andorra would\r\nwelcome the General Assembly’s adoption of the General\r\nCommittee’s recommendation first, that the additional\r\nitem entitled “Capital punishment” be included in the\r\nagenda; and, secondly, that, as is only natural, it be\r\ndiscussed in the Third Committee as sub-item (e) of\r\nagenda item 100, “Human rights questions”.\r\nMr. Chaves (Kyrgyzstan): The Republic of\r\nKyrgyzstan has deep feelings of concern about the subject\r\nof this discussion.\r\nWe have all observed the great increase in crime\r\nthroughout the world and the concern that all nations and\r\npeoples of the world feel about this subject.\r\nThe subject of capital punishment has been dealt\r\nwith very extensively by great philosophers. The founding\r\nfather of criminal law, Cesare Beccaria, referred to the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nsubject a long time ago. We also find references to it by\r\nMontesquieu and Voltaire.\r\nBut at present there is genuine concern throughout the\r\nworld about this subject. There is an increase in violent\r\ncrime; there is a very great increase in crimes against\r\nhumanity and genocide; and there is also a great increase in\r\nthe violation of human rights of a criminal nature.\r\nTherefore it is only natural that the General Assembly\r\nshould concern itself with the subject of crime and capital\r\npunishment.\r\nOn this subject I should like briefly to quote the\r\nfollowing from Dostoyevsky:\r\n“We cannot judge crime with ready-made opinions.\r\nThe philosophy of crime is a little more complicated\r\nthan people think. It is acknowledged that neither\r\nprisons for convicts nor the hulks nor any system of\r\nhard labour ever cured a criminal.”\r\nFor all those reasons, the delegation of Kyrgyzstan\r\nsupports the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): We have\r\nnow heard three speakers in favour of the inclusion of this\r\nitem in the agenda.\r\nMr. Khan (Pakistan): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the members of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC) and to put on record our views on the\r\nrequest, contained in documents A/49/234 and Add.1, for\r\nthe inclusion of an additional item entitled “Capital\r\npunishment” in the agenda of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session.\r\nPrior to the meeting on 7 November 1994 of the\r\nGeneral Committee, whose report is at present under the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s consideration, the members of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference in New York met\r\nfor an exchange of views on the request for the inclusion of\r\nan additional item, “Capital punishment”. While recognizing\r\nthe right of Member States to request the inscription of\r\nadditional items, the members of the OIC felt that, in view\r\nof the highly sensitive and controversial nature of the\r\nproposal, there was a need to carry out further consultations\r\nbefore proceeding with its inscription as an additional item\r\non the General Assembly’s agenda at the current session.\r\nThe OIC also felt that the request was not urgent enough to\r\nmerit its inscription as an additional item.\r\nThe group also expressed its very strong objection to\r\nallocating the proposed additional agenda item on capital\r\npunishment to the Third Committee, as proposed by the\r\nsponsors. However, the members of the OIC, exhibiting\r\na spirit of compromise and wishing to promote consensus,\r\nfelt that, in the event that the General Committee were to\r\nagree to the request of the sponsors to recommend to the\r\nGeneral Assembly the inclusion of the additional item, it\r\nshould be allocated to the Sixth Committee, not to the\r\nThird Committee, as a sub-item of agenda item 100,\r\n“Human rights questions”.\r\nThese decisions of the OIC were conveyed in\r\nwriting by its Chairman to you, Mr. President, for the\r\ninformation of the members of the General Committee\r\nwhen it met on 7 November. Much to the regret of the\r\nOIC countries, the sponsors of the proposed additional\r\nitem opted instead to take a vote on their proposal in the\r\nGeneral Committee meeting on 7 November, without\r\ngiving due consideration to the extremely pertinent views\r\nof the OIC.\r\nThe OIC members continue to have serious\r\nreservations about the inscription of a new agenda sub-\r\nitem, “Capital punishment”, and its allocation to the Third\r\nCommittee as sub-item (e) of agenda item 100, “Human\r\nrights questions”. It is our hope that the members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will give appropriate consideration to\r\nthe views of the 51 States Members of the OIC when\r\nconsidering the report of the General Committee\r\ncontained in document A/49/250/Add.3. We should not be\r\nled to accommodate the domestic compulsions of any\r\ncountry.\r\nMr. Razali (Malaysia): During the consideration of\r\nthis issue in the General Committee last week, my\r\ndelegation stated its position. As this issue is now before\r\nthe General Assembly, it is necessary to restate\r\nMalaysia’s position.\r\nMalaysia opposes the inclusion of the item in the\r\nagenda. We cannot agree to such an inclusion, as we\r\nbelieve that it is the right of every State to choose the\r\nmost appropriate penal system in response to the needs of\r\nits own society.\r\nLike many other countries of both the North and the\r\nSouth, Malaysia has capital punishment in its laws. This\r\ndoes not mean that we do not value life. Throughout its\r\nhistory, Malaysia has been at the confluence of many\r\nhumanistic civilizations. Our society and our laws are\r\npredicated on humanism, justice and the necessity of the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nState’s possessing the proper deterrent to violations of law,\r\ncommensurate with the degree of such violations. Our\r\npeople and our society are at peace with this power of the\r\nState, including the death penalty, even if the manifestations\r\nof our society celebrate the sanctity and beauty of life.\r\nOur problem with the initiative at hand is its single-\r\nmindedness and its blanket attempt to impose one point of\r\nview on all societies, when that point of view may apply to\r\nonly a few. Furthermore, this initiative takes no account of\r\ndifferences in cultural mores. It is not sensitive to different\r\nneeds. While the motive behind the initiative is respected,\r\nit cannot be forced to apply to all.\r\nThe initiative, even if the purpose is to have a debate,\r\nwill divide us. It would be a serious mistake if that division\r\nwere seen to be on the basis of religion. The last thing we\r\nshould do is to debate the religion or culture of one against\r\nthat of the other.\r\nThe initiative seeks to impose a moral imperative, but\r\nthe effect of that effort tends towards being divisive,\r\nintrusive and non-applicable. It had been my delegation’s\r\nhope that the sponsors would undertake further\r\nconsultations on this issue. If, however, the proposal is put\r\nto a vote today, my delegation will vote against it.\r\nMr. Yousif (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nContrary to its customary practice of adopting decisions by\r\nconsensus, the General Committee voted on the question of\r\nincluding a new agenda item entitled “Capital punishment”.\r\nThe inclusion of the item calling for the abolition of the\r\ndeath penalty, was passed by a majority of 17 votes out of\r\na total of 33 votes in the General Committee. It was clear\r\nthat many countries abstained from voting in favour of the\r\ninclusion of the item because of the sensitivity of the issue\r\nand because it touches upon the sovereign rights of States\r\nand, therefore, it should not be included as an item on the\r\nagenda.\r\nMy delegation believes that the discussion in the Third\r\nCommittee of the question of abolishing the death penalty\r\nas a sub-item of agenda item 100, “Human rights\r\nquestions”, would put my country, along with more than\r\n130 States Members of this Organization that apply the\r\ndeath penalty, in a very awkward position. We in the Sudan\r\nconsider the death penalty to be divinely ordained. Allah\r\nalmighty says in the Koran:\r\n“In the Law of Equality there is life to you, O ye men\r\nof understanding that ye may Restrain yourselves”.\r\n(Sura 2, Verse 179)\r\nThe abolition or non-abolition of the death penalty\r\nis a matter that has to do with the jurisdiction of\r\nsovereign States. The adoption by the United Nations of\r\na resolution on this question may infuriate public opinion\r\nin the whole world. It may put the United Nations in the\r\nunacceptable position of contradicting the principles\r\nenshrined in the very Charter of the United Nations,\r\nespecially paragraph 7 of Article 2, which prohibits the\r\nUnited Nations from intervening in the internal affairs of\r\nany country.\r\nAlso Article 13 of the Charter stipulates that the\r\nGeneral Assembly shall initiate studies and make\r\nrecommendations for the purpose of promoting\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nThe delegation of my country believes that the Sixth\r\nCommittee, rather than the Third Committee, is the\r\nappropriate body to look into the question of the death\r\npenalty. That opinion is based on the fact that the death\r\npenalty is more a legal matter than a human-rights\r\nquestion. The abolition of the death penalty and the whole\r\nmatter of the relationship between national jurisdiction\r\nand international jurisdiction might give rise to legal\r\nproblems. There is also the question that the call for\r\nabolishing the death penalty runs counter to the provisions\r\nof the Charter in the Articles I have just mentioned.\r\nThere are also the legal aspects relating to the\r\nquestion of the usefulness of the death penalty as a means\r\nof combating crime at the national and international levels\r\nand the effect this may have on preserving the stability of\r\nsocieties and the lives of individuals. There is no doubt at\r\nall that it is the Sixth Committee that has the mandate to\r\nconsider the question, as it is the Committee that\r\ndiscusses all legal matters.\r\nFor all these reasons, my delegation finds that this\r\nAssembly should have voted on paragraphs 2 and 3 of the\r\nreport contained in document A/49/250/Add.3.\r\nThe inclusion of this item on our agenda and its\r\nallocation to the Third Committee or the Sixth Committee\r\nis a procedural matter. What concerns us here is the\r\nsubstantive aspect with all its grave dimensions. We do\r\nnot see any benefit that would accrue to international\r\ncooperation from the abolition of the death penalty. Even\r\nif such a resolution were to be adopted by the General\r\nAssembly, we could not expect all the Member States to\r\naccept it, as a majority of them apply the death penalty in\r\naccordance with their national legislation. That being the\r\ncase, the delegation of my country asks the Assembly to\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nproceed with a recorded vote on the inclusion of this item\r\non its agenda. Once this is done, there should be a vote on\r\nthe allocation of the item to the Third Committee.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): Three\r\ndelegations have now spoken against the inclusion of this\r\nadditional item on the agenda.\r\nThe General Assembly will now take a decision on the\r\ninclusion of the additional item.\r\nA vote has been requested, and we shall now begin\r\nthe voting process.\r\nI put to the vote the General Committee’s\r\nrecommendation that an additional item entitled “Capital\r\npunishment” be included in the agenda of the present\r\nsession.\r\nThe recommendation was adopted by 70 votes to 24,\r\nwith 42 abstentions.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nadditional item entitled “Capital punishment” is thus\r\nincluded in the agenda.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nexplain their votes.\r\nMr. Chew (Singapore): My delegation abstained in\r\nthe voting on the inclusion of the item entitled “Capital\r\npunishment” in the agenda of the forty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nSingapore does not support the abolition of capital\r\npunishment and does not agree with the substance of the\r\ndraft resolution contained in the appendix to document\r\nA/49/234, which was submitted by the countries that asked\r\nfor the inclusion of this item. But my delegation abstained\r\nin the voting as Singapore has consistently adhered to the\r\nprinciple that it is the right of any delegation to request the\r\ninclusion of an item in the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly, provided that it is not one that runs counter to\r\nthe United Nations Charter or is frivolous. However, when\r\nthe item comes up for consideration my delegation will\r\nstrongly oppose the attempt by countries, through the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly, to seek the abolition of\r\ncapital punishment in other countries.\r\nWhile we understand and respect the position of those\r\ncountries that are opposed to the death penalty, they must\r\nappreciate the position of other countries, like Singapore,\r\nthat have capital punishment.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Capital punishment is, undoubtedly an important\r\nquestion and a sensitive issue. It is not a new question,\r\neither, as it has been a matter of conscience for mankind\r\nsince the beginning of life in organized society. Nor is it,\r\nin view of the priorities and the work of the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, a matter of such\r\nurgency that it justifies inscribing an additional item on\r\nthe agenda without adequate previous consultation and in\r\nparticular, as a result of a vote in the Bureau and then in\r\nthe General Assembly — something which immediately\r\nintroduces an element of confrontation in the\r\nconsideration of this item that is prejudicial to the very\r\ncause the delegations that have sponsored the proposal\r\nclaim to promote.\r\nThe harmonization of national legislations whilst\r\nrespecting the principle of consensus, which is the very\r\nbasis of contemporary international law and which is\r\ninherent in the sovereignty of States, is both an arduous\r\nand a desirable task. Such harmonization often needs long\r\nand laborious processes to mature and presupposes that\r\nthe specific nature of the differences in the various legal\r\nsystems and the various schools of thought is not blurred\r\nbut, rather, that the common ground between them is\r\nenhanced, in view of the respect due to the referential\r\nvalues of all legal orders that underlie the legislation of\r\nStates.\r\nThe United Nations work to codify and progressively\r\ndevelop international law in various spheres of human\r\nactivity, including criminal law, bears witness to the fact\r\nthat the universal accession to standards, particularly\r\nwhen they are not based on customary law, has always\r\nbeen characterized by the compatibility — or by the lack\r\nof incompatibility — of those standards with the\r\nunderlying principles of national legislations. Indeed, it is\r\nthis very wise and pragmatic approach that prevailed in\r\nconnection with the matter before us, since capital\r\npunishment in international law is the subject of a strictly\r\noptional protocol, this statute naturally reflecting the\r\nobjective constraints that make it impossible to unify law\r\nin this matter at the level of the international community\r\nas a whole.\r\nIt would have been sufficient, and undoubtedly much\r\nmore appropriate, for the sponsors to have chosen to deal\r\nwith the question of capital punishment under an existing\r\nagenda item, perhaps that on the implementation of\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\nhuman rights instruments or the more general topic of\r\ncrime prevention and criminal justice. The debate might\r\nhave, once again, clarified positions in a calm and\r\nresponsible manner. Understanding would thereby have\r\nbeen fostered and confrontation avoided.\r\nBut that was not the choice made, and several\r\nsponsors indicated during the deliberations in the Bureau\r\nthat their initiative would not be held up by an effort to\r\nfind consensus. This choice is fraught with consequences\r\nfor the expected outcome of the work of the General\r\nAssembly on this matter, for it immediately introduces an\r\ninopportune and unfortunate division, whereas the general\r\ntrend is towards promoting compromise and consensus by\r\nmeans of negotiation and mutual concessions on many\r\nimportant issues on this session’s agenda.\r\nThis procedural debate is not the appropriate\r\nframework for the consideration of the substance of the\r\nmatter. In the light of a mere procedural vote, no hasty\r\nconclusion should therefore be drawn with regard to the\r\ndedication of anyone to the value and the dignity of the\r\nhuman person, as well as to human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms in general. The question that arises is whether it\r\nis opportune to include such an item on the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, whether there is any likelihood of\r\narriving at a positive result, bearing duly in mind the\r\nworkload of the current session and the necessary energy\r\nand effort required to ensure the successful conclusion of\r\nour work on a range of issues of the highest relevance to\r\ndaily life and the future of the peoples of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe delegation of Algeria is not convinced of the\r\nexpediency of including this item on the agenda. Nor are\r\nwe convinced that there is any possibility of agreement on\r\nany positive result. Its negative vote is based on all these\r\nconsiderations.\r\nMr. Takht-Ravanchi (Islamic Republic of Iran): The\r\nidea of punishing a human being with death, however duly\r\ntried and convicted, has always engaged the deep human\r\nemotions of compassion, tenderness and kindness. These\r\nare considerations that are deeply rooted in the Islamic\r\nsystem of criminal justice. Nevertheless, Islam recognizes\r\nthe legitimacy of reserving capital punishment for a\r\nrestricted number of heinous crimes where the criminal\r\njustice system defends the safety, integrity and welfare of\r\nthe public at large against the criminal. The Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran applies the rule of Islamic law and, as\r\nsuch, the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran opposes\r\nany attempt to impose universally the abolition of capital\r\npunishment.\r\nHaving said that, my delegation believes that\r\nreserving capital punishment for a restricted number of\r\ngrievous crimes serves the common good to the extent\r\nthat its abolition, however appealing to human\r\ncompassion, will not. The argument against the deterrent\r\neffect of capital punishment is not convincing. In our\r\nview, taking into account all aspects of crime, particularly\r\nin today’s complex world, deterrence and retribution play\r\na significant role in justifying a commitment to and the\r\nadministration of capital punishment. Therefore, my\r\ndelegation voted against, on substantive grounds, the\r\nproposal to include an item in this regard on the agenda\r\nof the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Eldeeb (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe question of applying or abolishing the death penalty\r\nis a matter that has to do with the judicial system of\r\nevery individual State. The application of that penalty\r\naims primarily at protecting the most important human\r\nright, the right to life. Capital punishment in countries\r\nwhich apply the death penalty is a means of deterring\r\nthose who would commit the crime of murder and thereby\r\nwould take the life of another. Thus the application of the\r\ndeath penalty reduces crime rates. It is well known that\r\njudicial systems are based on values that stem from the\r\ncultural background and the civilization of each particular\r\ncountry. Therefore, from the standpoint of respecting the\r\nspecific and multifarious aspects of those States in\r\nreligious and cultural terms, the international community\r\ntended to deal with this question in the context of the\r\nOptional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil\r\nand Political Rights. Proceeding from this, the delegation\r\nof Egypt believes that the discussion of the question of\r\nthe application or abolition of the death penalty by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, with a view to adopting a resolution\r\nto abolish that penalty is unjustifiable because such hasty\r\naction would involve disregarding the characteristics and\r\ndifferences we have just highlighted, and would be\r\ntantamount to superseding the framework established by\r\nthe protocol which gave States the option of whether or\r\nnot they should take such a measure. On the other hand,\r\nmy delegation believes that if it is necessary for the\r\nGeneral Assembly to deal with questions concerning the\r\napplication of the death penalty, this should be done first\r\nof all by putting things into perspective and the question\r\nshould be referred to the Sixth Committee, as it is the\r\nCommittee which deals with legal and legislative matters\r\nrelating to the different judicial systems of States.\r\nConsequently, it is clear that the consideration of the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 14 November 1994\r\napplication or abolition of the death penalty is a legal issue\r\nrather than a human rights issue. Proceeding from this, my\r\ndelegation has voted against the inclusion of this item on\r\nthe agenda and against its allocation to the Third\r\nCommittee.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nGeneral Committee further decided to recommend to the\r\nAssembly that the item entitled “Capital punishment” be\r\nallocated to the Third Committee as sub-item (e) of agenda\r\nitem 100, “Human rights questions”.\r\nA vote has been requested, and we shall now begin\r\nthe voting process.\r\nI put to the vote the recommendation by the General\r\nCommittee that the agenda item entitled “Capital\r\npunishment” be allocated to the Third Committee as sub-\r\nitem (e) of agenda item 100, “Human rights questions”.\r\nThe recommendation was adopted by 69 votes to 25,\r\nwith 37 abstentions.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nagenda item entitled “Capital punishment” is allocated to\r\nthe Third Committee as sub-item (e) of agenda item 100.\r\nThe Chairman of the Third Committee will be\r\ninformed of the decision just taken.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.45 p.m.\r\n21\r\n"
