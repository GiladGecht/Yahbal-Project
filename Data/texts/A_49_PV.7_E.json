(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Guntis Ulmanis, President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia.\r\nMr. Guntis Ulmanis, President of the Republic of\r\nLatvia, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia, His Excellency Mr. Guntis Ulmanis,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ulmanis (spoke in Latvian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Allow me to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session and to wish you every\r\nsuccess in leading this august body. May this session be\r\nconstructive and productive for you and all delegations.\r\nNew geopolitical, economic and technological realities\r\nhave appeared at the close of the twentieth century. The\r\ndestructive cold war has come to an end and its symbol -\r\nthe Berlin Wall - has collapsed. The insuppressible\r\nlong-held yearnings of many peoples for freedom and\r\nindependence led in the end to the disintegration of even\r\nthe seemingly indestructible Soviet empire, clearly\r\nreaffirming the lasting strength and integrity of the\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations -\r\npeace, equality and justice. That is why this Organization\r\nhas always played and will continue to play a role in\r\nfurthering the progress of nations, as evidenced by its vast\r\nundertakings in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, as well as its efforts to increase the\r\nwell-being of society and every individual.\r\nTwo years ago, the Secretary-General in his report\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\", comprehensively analysed\r\naspects related to the maintenance of peace and security.\r\nThis report led to a broad debate on concepts such as\r\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking and\r\npost-conflict peace-building. Preventive diplomacy by the\r\nUnited Nations and other organizations undoubtedly\r\nfurthered the resolution of a very difficult issue for Latvia\r\nand all of Europe - the withdrawal of foreign military\r\nforces from the territories of the Baltic States.\r\nWith satisfaction I should like to report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly that, on the whole, General Assembly\r\nconsensus resolutions 47/21 of 25 November 1992 and\r\n48/18 of 15 November 1993, entitled \"Complete\r\nwithdrawal of foreign military forces from the territories\r\nof the Baltic States\", have been implemented. The last\r\nRussian military units departed Latvia and Estonia at the\r\nend of August. Thus, the Second World War has ended\r\nfor the Baltic States. Our bilateral negotiations with the\r\nRussian Federation, which lasted for more than two years,\r\nculminated with the signing on 30 April 1994 of\r\nagreements the ratification of which has been included in\r\nthe agenda of the Parliament of Latvia.\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nI can state with full conviction that the international\r\ncalls for the withdrawal of Russian troops, made by the\r\nUnited Nations and the Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), amongst others, were\r\npivotal to the successful resolution of this long drawn-out\r\nmatter.\r\nWe believe that this approach may be useful as an\r\nexample for the resolution of other global issues and we are\r\nprepared to share our experience with others.\r\nThe United Nations and the CSCE will continue to\r\nhave an important role in the implementation of the\r\nagreements. According to the bilateral agreement between\r\nLatvia and Russia on the Skrunda radar facility, any attempt\r\nto settle disputes or differences of opinion connected with\r\nthe agreement by means of military threats or by the use of\r\narmed force shall be considered a threat to international\r\npeace and security and shall be brought before the United\r\nNations Security Council. For its part, representatives of\r\nthe CSCE will observe the implementation of the\r\nagreements and the fulfilment of the respective parties’\r\nobligations.\r\nHowever, we have yet to exhaust the opportunities for\r\npreventive diplomacy in the Baltic region. Baltic regional\r\nsecurity continues to be a pressing issue. On his visit to\r\nLatvia last summer, Mr. William Clinton, President of the\r\nUnited States of America, stressed that the sovereign and\r\nindependent Baltic States must not be part of any sphere of\r\ninfluence. It must be noted that President Clinton played\r\na vital role in disentangling problems which had developed\r\nduring negotiations with the Russian Federation on the\r\nwithdrawal of its troops from Estonia and Latvia.\r\nI should like to remind the international community\r\nthat the Russian radar facility will remain in Skrunda for\r\nfive and a half years, and nuclear reactors will remain in\r\nPaldiski, Estonia. Heavy Russian military transit takes\r\nplace through Lithuania to Kaliningrad, where a high\r\nmilitary concentration is maintained. On the whole, these\r\nare risk factors which potentially threaten the Baltic States\r\nand, in fact, the entire Baltic Sea region. In many respects,\r\nBaltic security is a guarantee for peace and stability in\r\nEurope. The Baltic States are already considering the\r\npossible solutions to this important question, and I hope\r\nthat the Member States will devote their full attention and\r\ninterest to these ends.\r\nA significant dialogue between our two countries has\r\nconcluded with the completion of Russian troop withdrawal\r\nfrom Latvia. Thanks to the support of many countries and\r\ninternational organizations, Latvia today is free from\r\nforeign military presence. Nevertheless, without the\r\nforesight and the civility displayed by both parties, we\r\ncould not stand here today and speak of social harmony\r\nand tolerance in Latvia, nor could we say that both Latvia\r\nand the Russian Federation have one less problem to\r\naddress. Last spring, when I met with President Yeltsin\r\nin Moscow, I gained the conviction that in solving our\r\nproblem he was guided by good will.\r\nIn 1995, Europe and the world will celebrate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Allied victory over nazism.\r\nLatvians, too, fought against Hitler’s occupying forces in\r\nthe belief that an Allied victory would be followed by the\r\nrestoration of Latvian independence. However, whilst\r\nmany nations breathed freely again after the end of the\r\nNazi occupation, the Baltic States were engulfed for the\r\nsecond time by the totalitarian Soviet empire. As other\r\nnations celebrated the defeat of nazism, Latvia was\r\nsubjected to the deportation of hundreds of thousands of\r\ninnocent persons and the systematic destruction of the\r\nLatvian State and national identity. Latvia and its people\r\nare the victims of both regimes - nazism and communism.\r\nJustice would prevail if the new democratic Russia,\r\nwhich played a decisive role in the destruction of the\r\n\"Evil Empire\", were to engage with Latvia in the\r\nappraisal of the actions taken by the Soviet Union against\r\nLatvia in 1940. The signing of truthful bilateral\r\ndocuments would preclude any petty psychological\r\nfeelings of revenge and would provide amends to the\r\nvictims of the totalitarian regime in both countries. These\r\n\"truth\" documents would foster even greater harmony\r\nbetween the various nationalities in Latvia and, we\r\nbelieve, lift some of Russia’s unenviable inherited burden.\r\nSuch cases already exist. The documents signed by\r\nthe Presidents of Russia and several Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean States have marked an end to the legacy of the\r\npast, which had also been a burden to Russian society.\r\nWe believe that it is impossible to fully comprehend\r\nthe consequences of the Soviet occupation without an\r\nobjective analysis of the events of 1939 and 1940. These\r\nconsequences have been and continue to be felt in Latvia\r\nin the areas of political, economic and social\r\ndevelopment. No other country lost nearly 40 per cent of\r\nits native population during the Second World War; in no\r\nother post-war European country has the native population\r\nbecome a minority in seven of its largest cities, including\r\nthe capital; and no other country has experienced\r\npopulation transfers and mass deportations on such a\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nscale. The Latvian language, too, was under threat of\r\nextinction, despite the fact that it had survived for 4,000\r\nyears, partly in the form of a unique collection of more\r\nthan one million folk songs. We wish to protect Latvia’s\r\nhistorical and cultural heritage, because Latvians can\r\npreserve their national identity only in this small land on\r\nthe shores of the Baltic Sea. Latvians never have and never\r\nwill ask for any other land.\r\nI should like to draw the Assembly’s attention to the\r\nnecessity for regional cooperation. History has repeatedly\r\nshown that geographically and historically close States have\r\nforged the deepest relations, thereby enriching and\r\nfurthering mutual development.\r\nFollowing the restoration of independence, the Baltic\r\nParliamentary Assembly was formed, and this month work\r\nwas begun by the Baltic Council of Ministers, which\r\ncoordinates our policies in foreign affairs, trade, legislation\r\nand other matters. In other words, a balanced and active\r\nBaltic union has been created. At the same time, an\r\nevolutionary process towards an expanded European Union\r\nwith a dynamic Nordic-Baltic dimension is taking place.\r\nThe model for regional cooperation in Northern Europe\r\naspired to by Latvia is \"three plus five\" - three Baltic States\r\nand five Nordic States.\r\nRecognizing the important role played by the United\r\nNations in international peace-keeping, Latvia, together with\r\nits neighbours, Estonia and Lithuania, has established the\r\nBaltic Battalion, which in the future may participate in the\r\npeace-keeping operations of the Security Council. The\r\nNordic States, the United Kingdom and the United States\r\nhave greatly contributed to the establishment of the Baltic\r\nBattalion. We believe that the three Baltic States will\r\nthereby further the aims shared by the Member States of\r\nthe largest and most influential of international bodies - the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nDuring the cold war the Baltic Sea was a boundary.\r\nNowadays the Baltic Sea unites rather than divides States.\r\nFive years ago the \"Baltic Way\" - a human chain reaching\r\nfrom Tallinn through Riga to Vilnius - symbolized the\r\nshared road towards independence and democracy. Today\r\nthis road has also regained its historical and economic\r\nsignificance in our region. At the turn of the century the\r\nBaltic Way will already be an established part of the global\r\ninformation highway.\r\nI wish to reaffirm that Latvia will do its utmost to\r\nfoster peaceful cooperation and the spirit of understanding,\r\nmutual trust and tolerance on the shores of the Baltic Sea.\r\nInternational peace and security and good-\r\nneighbourly relations between States are inextricably\r\nlinked to economic and social development. The end of\r\nthe cold war has created new opportunities to devote\r\ngreater attention to these issues. Last spring the\r\nSecretary-General issued a report (A/48/935) entitled\r\n\"An Agenda for Development\". Latvia welcomes this\r\ninitiative, which marks a historic turning point in the\r\nwork of the United Nations. From being an international\r\nforum primarily serving the interests of individual States,\r\nthe United Nations is becoming a representative and\r\ndefender of the needs of humanity. Economic and social\r\ndevelopment increases the security of every inhabitant of\r\nour planet.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations and each\r\nMember State should recognize the need not only for a\r\ncoalition for democracy, but also for a fight against\r\norganized crime and the trafficking of nuclear materials\r\nand narcotics. Without effective solutions to these\r\nproblems, the security of each inhabitant of our planet\r\nand the development of every country and society are\r\nendangered. I invite the United Nations to consider\r\norganizing a high-level meeting for the solving of those\r\nproblems.\r\nMany components of the United Nations system,\r\nprimarily the Development Programme, are concerned\r\nwith the promotion of economic progress. Therefore,\r\nwithin the framework of the aims of the proposed Agenda\r\nfor Development, one of the challenges is to simplify,\r\nrenew and integrate the United Nations system. Latvia is\r\namong those countries whose economic, governmental\r\nand social structures are undergoing a period of transition.\r\nEffective United Nations assistance to these countries\r\nwould speed this process, allowing them to become donor\r\ncountries sooner.\r\nThe concept of development is very broad. It\r\nincludes social and economic progress; justice and\r\ndemocracy, as the foundation of society; and the\r\nprotection of human rights and the environment. Even if\r\nthe threat of global nuclear war has subsided, the prospect\r\nof environmental catastrophe remains. I therefore restate\r\nLatvia’s proposal, first made at the 1992 Rio de Janeiro\r\nEarth Summit, to host in Latvia before the end of this\r\ncentury a world summit at which participating States\r\nwould commit themselves to diverting all resources\r\ngained from disarmament towards long-term development,\r\nespecially for the protection of the environment and\r\nreversal of ecological damage caused by military activity.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nThis conference could take place in Jurmala, on the shores\r\nof the Baltic Sea.\r\nLatvia attaches great importance to international\r\nconferences organized by the United Nations. As a\r\nmember of the Bureau of the Preparatory Committee,\r\nLatvia has become actively involved in the preparation for\r\nthe World Social Summit. Furthermore, Latvia is one of\r\nthe few States whose head of delegation is also a Vice-\r\nPresident of the Conference.\r\nEach global conference is an opportunity for every\r\nparticipating State to review and compare the sum of its\r\nexperience. The issue of implementing the adopted\r\nresolutions at both the national and international levels is\r\nyet to be fully addressed. I would like to inform the\r\nAssembly of the extent of Latvia’s adherence to the\r\nrecommendations adopted at the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights. In its Vienna Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action the Conference invited States to establish and\r\nstrengthen national institutions for the protection of human\r\nrights. The Conference recommended that each State\r\nconsider the desirability of drawing up a national action\r\nplan identifying steps whereby that State would improve the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights.\r\nLatvia demonstrated its commitment to United Nations\r\nprinciples and its readiness to implement the\r\nrecommendations of the Conference by establishing in\r\nMarch 1994 the post of State Minister for Human Rights,\r\nas well as forming a Government Working Group on the\r\nProtection of the Rights of Individuals, allocating the\r\nnecessary resources towards these ends. We believe that\r\nthe United Nations should devote a greater percentage of its\r\nregular budget to the promotion and protection of human\r\nrights.\r\nIn response to a request by the Working Group, a\r\nhigh-level international mission organized by the United\r\nNations Development Programme visited Latvia in July this\r\nyear. The mission, which included representatives of\r\nseveral international organizations, including CSCE and the\r\nCouncil of Europe, consulted Latvia on the development of\r\na national programme for the protection and promotion of\r\nhuman rights. At Latvia’s invitation, the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights will visit Latvia in\r\nOctober this year.\r\nI am proud that Latvia is one of the first countries to\r\nhave demonstrated an awareness of its responsibility by\r\nestablishing a national programme for the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights. Latvia is prepared to discuss\r\nand share its knowledge and experience with all interested\r\nparties.\r\nWe support the proposal made to the General\r\nAssembly by Mr. Boris Yeltsin, President of the Russian\r\nFederation, that the principles of the Declaration on the\r\nRights of Persons Belonging to National, Ethnic,\r\nReligious and Linguistic Minorities be embodied in the\r\nlegislation of all Member States. At the World\r\nConference on Human Rights Latvia called for the\r\nestablishment of standards and implementation\r\nmechanisms for the rights of minorities and foreigners.\r\nThose activities in the sphere of human rights are\r\ngrounded in history. Prior to the Second World War, as\r\na member of the League of Nations, Latvia fostered\r\nharmonious inter-ethnic relations. We are now trying to\r\nrenew and cultivate this great tradition. Immediately after\r\nthe restoration of its independence Latvia declared its\r\naccession to all the principal international human rights\r\ninstruments. As I have already mentioned, a major effort\r\nis being made in the establishment of a national\r\nprogramme for the promotion and protection of the\r\nhuman rights of the individual in order that every\r\nindividual be guaranteed equal rights and an equal\r\nopportunity to defend these rights. I believe that the\r\nconcept of equal opportunity not only characterizes the\r\nfundamental rights of the individual, but is also a\r\nprerequisite for development.\r\nLatvia has always been open to cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations, the CSCE and other international\r\norganizations. Latvia reaffirmed this when it passed its\r\nCitizenship Law. In promulgating this legislation, it\r\nfollowed the recommendations of the CSCE and the\r\nCouncil of Europe, and the passing of the law has been\r\nevaluated positively by these organizations.\r\nThe need for rationalizing and revitalizing the work\r\nof the United Nations is becoming ever more apparent.\r\nLatvia is actively participating in the search for optimal\r\nsolutions. Latvia supports the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil, perceiving this as a fair opportunity for small\r\nnations to increase their role in important international\r\ndecision-making. Latvia also supports the improvement\r\nof cooperation and coordination between the United\r\nNations and other international organizations, including\r\nthe CSCE, the European Union and the Council of\r\nEurope.\r\nWe also welcome and support the action taken by\r\nthe Secretary-General to introduce a new, effective system\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nof accountability and responsibility, and, pursuant to the\r\nUnited States initiative, to establish the Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services.\r\nLatvia supports especially the initiative to reform the\r\ncalculation of United Nations assessments, based strictly on\r\nthe principle of \"capacity to pay\". This would be a step\r\ntowards improving the dire financial situation of the\r\nOrganization and would pave the way for a fair solution to\r\nthe issue of the assessments of Latvia and many other\r\nStates.\r\nAlthough the inescapable difficulties associated with\r\na transition period can still be felt in our economy and\r\nsocial sector, Latvia is endeavouring to fulfil its\r\ninternational obligations and commitments. However,\r\ncontrary to standard United Nations practice, the current\r\nassessment of Latvia has been calculated without taking\r\ninto account its actual capacity to pay. Instead, the data of\r\na non-existent country - the former Soviet Union - has been\r\nused to determine Latvia’s assessment. Latvia has\r\nconsistently and unwaveringly stated that it was forcibly\r\nincorporated into the former Soviet Union and therefore is\r\nnot, and cannot ever be, its successor, with all the rights\r\nand obligations that this would entail. This was also stated\r\nin a letter to the Secretary-General in 1992.\r\nLatvia expects that the General Assembly will address\r\nthis issue in the course of this session on the basis of the\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality.\r\nWe consider that the same importance should be\r\naccorded to the United Nations principle of universality.\r\nNext year, the world will celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Latvia,\r\ntoo, has begun preparations for this great anniversary. We\r\nhope that the Riga Dom Boys Choir will sing at the\r\ncelebration concert to be held here in New York. This\r\nwould be deeply symbolic, since future generations will\r\nshape the fate of nations. In many ways their fate will be\r\ndecided by the heritage we leave to our children. We must\r\ndo our utmost to draw closer to the age when nations will\r\nnot fight against nations, but all will join forces in the\r\nbattle against darkness. This sentiment, which has been\r\ndrawn deep from the well of our national wisdom, seems to\r\nembody the essence of the United Nations now and in the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Guntis Ulmanis, President of the Republic of\r\nLatvia, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alija Izetbegović, President of the\r\nPresidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nMr. Alija Izetbegović, President of the Presidency of\r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted\r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nPresidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alija Izetbegović, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Izetbegović: Allow me, at the outset, to\r\ncommend Mr. Samuel Insanally for the able manner in\r\nwhich he conducted the work of the forty-eighth session\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of this, the forty-ninth session. I\r\nwish you success in pursuing this very important task.\r\nI thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak\r\non behalf of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at\r\nthis distinguished gathering.\r\nI come from Bosnia and Herzegovina, a far-away\r\ncountry that has currently been the subject of many\r\ndiscussions.\r\nUnfortunately, I have to begin my statement by\r\nrepeating facts that, for most of you, may be or should be\r\nwell known.\r\nAt the time - some three years ago - when\r\nYugoslavia experienced its dissolution, we were doing our\r\nbest to carry out the separation in a peaceful fashion and\r\nwithout any violence. For reasons already known, our\r\ninitiatives did not bear fruit.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nWhen Slovenia and Croatia seceded, and the\r\ndissolution of Yugoslavia had become inevitable, we\r\norganized a referendum in order to decide, in a democratic\r\nmanner, the fate of Bosnia. By a two-thirds majority -\r\nexactly 64.4 per cent of the body of registered voters,\r\ncitizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, opted for the country’s\r\nindependence in the referendum of 1 March 1992.\r\nInternational recognition of our country followed soon\r\nthereafter, and so did the aggression against it. The\r\ndecision on its recognition was made on 5 April 1992 and\r\nwas announced the following day, 6 April 1992. The\r\nSerbian and Montenegrin aggression against Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina began on 5 April 1992, the very day when the\r\ndecision on recognition of the country was adopted.\r\nThe aggression has continued to this day with more or,\r\nat times, less intensity, and without any prospect of its\r\ncoming to an end in the near future.\r\nThe war that was forced upon Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand its peoples - and that has now entered its thirty-first month -\r\nis one of the bloodiest wars in the history of mankind. At\r\nthe very beginning, it was not a war but rather an attack by\r\na well-armed and equipped army, the former Yugoslav\r\narmy, against defenceless citizens.\r\nThe results of this uneven struggle are as follows:\r\n70 per cent of our country came under occupation in the\r\nfirst months of the war; more than 200,000 civilians have\r\nbeen killed; over 1 million - or one fourth - of our\r\ninhabitants have been expelled from their homes; hundreds\r\nof cities and villages have been destroyed and burned. This\r\ncannot be described as a classic example of warfare\r\nbetween two armies. This has been a war of an army\r\nagainst civilians, followed by genocide and, to date,\r\nunprecedented destruction of cultural and religious objects.\r\nThe world has not responded in an appropriate manner\r\nto such barbarity.\r\nWhether it was because of the brutality of the attack,\r\nor because it was morally and psychologically unprepared,\r\nor perhaps because of its entanglement in its conflicting\r\ninterests, the world seemed confused and hesitant.\r\nWhen the news and pictures of new concentration\r\ncamps in the heart of Europe came out, the public was\r\nastonished or shocked, but for the most part those\r\nresponsible kept silent. Tens of thousands have perished in\r\nthose camps and many thousands have disappeared without\r\na trace. The more brutal an attack, the more hesitant the\r\nworld became. The free world neither defended nor\r\nsupported freedom. Our people, facing the threat of\r\nextermination and a clearly pronounced death sentence,\r\ndecided to defend itself.\r\nBut then it encountered a new absurdity. It found its\r\nhands tied. In short, before the war broke out against\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina the United Nations imposed a\r\nnotorious resolution that banned any import of weapons\r\ninto the territory of former Yugoslavia. Everything\r\nchanged: the war began, the aggressor and the victim\r\nwere clearly discernable, but the arms embargo has\r\nremained in place as if nothing had happened in the\r\ninterim. Justice was turned into injustice because the\r\naggressor had weapons - weapons that had been\r\nstockpiled over the course of 40 years - while the victim\r\nwas unarmed and its hands were kept tied.\r\nThe resolution on the arms embargo became its own\r\ncontradiction. By maintaining the imbalance in\r\nweaponry, it has prolonged the war and turned the peace\r\nnegotiations into diktat by the better-armed aggressor.\r\nWe said to the world, \"You do not have to come to\r\ndefend us, but do at least untie our hands and allow us to\r\ndefend ourselves. While they kill our children, rape our\r\nwomen and destroy all our relics, do recognize our right\r\nto self-defence.\"\r\nSo far, however, the arms embargo has remained in\r\nplace. With only guns and rifles in their hands, our\r\ndefenders have faced artillery and tanks. We have lost\r\nmany people, and reports indicate that more than 90 per\r\ncent of them have been killed by grenades and artillery\r\nshells. Our cities and villages have been left at the mercy\r\nof the powerful military technology in the hands of the\r\nmurderers. In the capital city of Sarajevo alone, more\r\nthan 10,000 people have been killed and more than\r\n50,000 wounded. Not a single family is without\r\ncasualties, either killed or wounded.\r\nTo all this, the world has sent us one message:\r\nnegotiate. In the belief that the only right path was to\r\ncontinue to defend our land and that in this just struggle\r\nthe peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples of the world\r\nwould support us, we refused for a very long time to\r\nnegotiate with war criminals.\r\nFinally, faced with the unbearable plight of our\r\npeople and the world’s indifference, without any choice\r\nwe accepted negotiations. It turned out that the aggressor\r\nhad only been using negotiations as a way to bargain for\r\ntime and to cover up its continuation of the aggression.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nIn March 1993, after long and painful negotiations and with\r\nmany concessions from our side, we signed the so-called\r\nVance-Owen plan. The aggressor rejected it.\r\nThe next bloody round in the war ensued, to be\r\nfollowed by another round of negotiations that resulted, on\r\n5 July 1994, in a peace plan drawn up by the Contact\r\nGroup consisting of five great Powers: the United States of\r\nAmerica, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the\r\nRussian Federation. Again, we chose peace and the\r\nattackers, once again, opted for a continuation of the war.\r\nWe accepted the unjust peace offer in order to halt the\r\nwar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We did so in the hope\r\nthat the injustice of the peace plan could still be corrected\r\nin the years of peace. Knowing the Bosnian soul, we\r\nbelieved - and we still believe - that peace can save - but\r\nthat war will destroy - all that we call Bosnia.\r\nWhat we call \"Bosnia\" is not merely a small piece of\r\nland in the Balkans. For many of us, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is not only a homeland: it is an idea; it is a\r\nbelief that peoples of different religions, different\r\nnationalities and different cultural traditions can live\r\ntogether. Were this dream to be forever buried, were this\r\nidea of tolerance among the peoples of the area to be\r\nirretrievably lost, the guilt would lie not only with those\r\nwho have been relentlessly killing Bosnia with their mortars\r\nfor over 30 months now but also with many of the\r\npowerful elsewhere in the world who could have helped yet\r\nhave chosen to do otherwise.\r\nTwo days ago, I left Sarajevo. I did not leave by\r\nplane because the airport was closed. I had to take land\r\nroutes through woods that are constantly exposed to fire\r\nand where many people are killed daily. For days there is\r\nno electricity, water and gas in the city. The capital is\r\ncompletely blocked and is virtually dying.\r\nYesterday, after I had arrived at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters, I received a letter from Srebrenica, a small\r\ntown on the river Drina. The letter was supposed to be a\r\nreport, but it was also a cry from a real human hell. I\r\ncould not find the strength to read it a second time.\r\nOver three months ago \"ethnic cleansing\" was\r\nreignited, and there is now a new wave. Thousands of\r\ncivilians whose only fault is that they are not Serbs have\r\nbeen expelled from their homes in Banja Luka, Bijeljina,\r\nJanja and other towns under the control of Karadzic’s army.\r\nOnce again, nothing has been done. The world seems to\r\nhave grown gradually accustomed to unpunished violations\r\nof the basic norms of international law. This is a sorry\r\nsituation, and one that concerns every man and every\r\nwoman in the world, no matter how near or far from\r\nBosnia they may be.\r\nFor a very long time I rejected - indeed, I still\r\nreject - any so-called conspiracy theory, the theory that all\r\nthat has happened to Bosnia has happened because its\r\nmajority nation is Muslim and there are dark powers that\r\nconsciously impel the Serbs towards the extermination of\r\nBosnian Muslims.\r\nThose who support this theory have their arguments,\r\nand I believe they have been heard here before. They\r\nmaintain that overt aggression, followed by genocide,\r\nconcentration camps and other forms of the darkest\r\nfascism, is at work in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that\r\nthe world must be blind not to see it. Is the world blind?\r\nDoes it consciously condone all these evils? It cannot be\r\nblind, and there is thus only the other alternative. This is\r\nthe argument that has gained an increasing number of\r\nsupporters. It will not be a good thing if the world’s\r\nbillion Muslims come to accept it.\r\nThe latest events surrounding the plan of the Contact\r\nGroup have given the supporters of the so-called\r\nconspiracy theory an additional argument, namely, that\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has been offered a proposal\r\nbacked by five major Powers and, therefore, by the\r\nmajority of the international community, and it has been\r\nclearly stated that the side that rejected the plan would be\r\npunished while the side that accepted it would be\r\nprotected. Yet the opposite has happened. The Serbs\r\nrejected the plan, and they have been rewarded by the\r\nsuspension of sanctions. We have accepted the plan, and\r\nwe have been punished by a complete blockade of\r\nSarajevo. Both processes have occurred simultaneously,\r\nin parallel.\r\nToday, the highest civilian and military United\r\nNations authorities are warning us: If you demand and\r\nsucceed in achieving the lifting of the arms embargo, the\r\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) will pull\r\nout of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and so\r\non.\r\nI have certainly not undertaken this long and arduous\r\njourney from Bosnia to America solely to convey facts\r\nthat may be known to the majority of those here. We in\r\nBosnia believe that, despite the hardships, good and\r\njustice cannot be defeated. We do not abandon our faith\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nthat the world can be better and that we should all work\r\nand strive continually to make it better.\r\nIn this conviction, and despite all our disappointments\r\nand frustrations, I have come to speak here before the\r\nAssembly and to present some of our proposals. From the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, we are asking\r\nthe following: first, that all resolutions on Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina adopted by the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly be implemented; secondly, that measures\r\nbe taken effectively to monitor the border between Serbia\r\nand Montenegro, on the one side, and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, on the other, so that any transport of troops,\r\nweapons and military equipment across that border may be\r\nprevented or detected in timely fashion; thirdly, that should\r\nthis transport occur, the decision on the suspension of some\r\nof the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro - Security\r\nCouncil resolution 943 (1994) - be immediately revoked\r\nand that tightened sanction measures be imposed in\r\naccordance with the plan of the Contact Group of July\r\n1994; fourthly, that there be no further easing of the\r\nsanctions towards Serbia and Montenegro until they\r\nrecognize Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia within\r\ninternationally recognized borders; fifthly, that a resolution\r\nbe adopted, without delay, to strengthen the protection and\r\nmandate the extension of the safe areas provided for in\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 824 (1993) and 836 (1993),\r\nand in accordance with provisions of Article 6 of the\r\nContact Group plan; and, sixthly, that decisions be taken to\r\nensure an immediate end to the strangulation of Sarajevo\r\nand to prevent a recurrence of such a situation.\r\nThe last-mentioned of these measures should envisage,\r\nas an integral element, the opening of the city along the\r\nnorth communication route - road and highway - through\r\nthe creation of a demilitarized belt 2.5 kilometres wide on\r\nboth sides of the thoroughfares. In this demilitarized belt,\r\nonly United Nations troops and police might remain. The\r\npotential use of force against the strangulation of Sarajevo\r\nis envisaged under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization’s decision of 9 February 1994.\r\nProvided that the above conditions were fulfilled, and\r\non condition that UNPROFOR continued to carry out its\r\nmission, the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina would be willing to accept a new, modified\r\nformula to deal with the problem of the arms embargo.\r\nUnder this formula we would limit our demand for the\r\nlifting of the arms embargo to the adoption of a formal\r\ndecision, and the application or consequences of that\r\ndecision would be deferred for six months. In this case\r\nUNPROFOR troops could remain in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the Contact Group would fulfil its promise,\r\nand a clear message would be conveyed to Karadzic’s\r\nSerbs.\r\nI should like, in conclusion, to state our two\r\ncommitments.\r\nFirst, our irrevocable objective is a democratic\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina within internationally recognized\r\nborders, and with full ethnic, religious and political rights\r\nfor all its citizens. In such a Bosnia and Herzegovina the\r\nSerbs will have all rights, up to the highest level of\r\nautonomy, but they cannot have a state within a state.\r\nSecondly, we consider that, like all other nations, we\r\nhave an inalienable right to self-defence. Therefore, if\r\nour compromise proposal on the arms embargo is rejected\r\nfor any reason, we shall ask our friends to secure the\r\nimmediate, and even unilateral, lifting of the embargo.\r\nUnfortunately, I have to inform representatives that, just\r\ntoday, I learned that this compromise proposal is meeting\r\nresistance, and even rejection, from some Contact Group\r\ncountries.\r\nFinally, I take this opportunity to express our sincere\r\ngratitude to all friends of Bosnia and Herzegovina who\r\nhave supported its struggle for survival and freedom.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina for the important statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alija Izetbegović, President of the Presidency of\r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\non the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Belgium, His Excellency Mr. Willy Claes.\r\nMr. Claes (Belgium) (interpretation from French):\r\nIt is with great pleasure that I join the previous speakers\r\nin congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of this Assembly. The great African country\r\nthat you represent, Côte d’Ivoire, has always played an\r\nactive and constructive role in our Organization. We are\r\ndelighted to have you presiding over our proceedings.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nMy German ministerial colleague, Mr. Klaus Kinkel,\r\nspoke this morning on behalf of the European Union. The\r\nviews of my delegation are faithfully reflected in his\r\nstatement and, consequently, there is no need for me to\r\naddress the positions he has outlined.\r\nFive years ago the talk was of a new international\r\norder. The events that shook Eastern Europe at that time\r\nled us to believe that the old bipolar world had expired and\r\nthat another order was bound to take its place. For some,\r\nthe reaction to the aggression against Kuwait marked the\r\nbeginning of this new phase. Reality did not live up to our\r\nhopes. Today we have come to understand that the\r\nequilibrium based on a bipolar world did not have a\r\n\"natural successor\" and that it is up to us to build a new\r\none, little by little, through trial and error.\r\nOf course, a new equilibrium is emerging in several\r\nparts of the world.\r\nFirst, there is the highly symbolic case of the Middle\r\nEast. Even if implementation of the Washington and Cairo\r\nagreements is proving as arduous as was expected, every\r\nnew stage constitutes an important step towards lasting\r\npeace. The historic rapprochement between Israel and\r\nJordan strengthens this prospect.\r\nMr. Seniloli (Fiji), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe new South Africa, too, is facing immense\r\nchallenges, but at the same time it has become a beacon of\r\nhope for the entire African continent.\r\nThe strengthening of democracy and the progress\r\nmade in regional integration in Latin America seem to us\r\nyet another meaningful evolution. A number of countries\r\nin this region have now found the way towards sustainable\r\neconomic development.\r\nThe same holds true for Asia, where, moreover, a\r\nreadiness for dialogue now exists. The regional Forum\r\nlaunched by the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), contacts on the Korean peninsula and, at another\r\nlevel, the dialogue between the two sides of the Formosa\r\nStrait all contribute towards a new climate of confidence.\r\nWhile preparing to welcome four new members, the\r\nEuropean Union has signed cooperation agreements with\r\nthe majority of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe\r\nthat might ultimately lead to full membership.\r\nSimultaneously, new geostrategic ties are being forged with\r\nRussia.\r\nThe same will for dialogue is reflected in the\r\ndiscussion of major issues that concern the future of our\r\nOrganization, such as reform of the Security Council.\r\nEven if divergences of opinion remain on various points,\r\nthe sense of common interest prevails.\r\nBelgium’s major concern remains the achievement\r\nof a more representative Council without diminishing its\r\ndecision-making capacity. We prefer therefore to avoid\r\nambitious projects that would give privileged status to\r\nseveral \"regional Powers\" according to imprecise criteria\r\nbut would not reinforce the Council’s ability to shoulder\r\nits responsibilities.\r\nWhy not, as a first step, adapt the Council’s\r\nmembership on the basis of unanimously agreed criteria?\r\nThe international community could, as a measure with\r\nimmediate advantageous effect, grant an additional\r\nnon-permanent seat to the regions that consider\r\nthemselves to be underrepresented and confer permanent\r\nmember status on those two economic Powers whose\r\npositive contribution to world affairs has long been\r\nrecognized.\r\nThese steps, however encouraging, do not by\r\nthemselves constitute a new international agreement.\r\nProgress and the readiness for rapprochement are by no\r\nmeans universal: Central Africa and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina are cases in point.\r\nThe situation in Rwanda is uppermost in our minds.\r\nThe threat it represents of destabilization in Burundi and\r\nthe neighbouring countries has become a constant cause\r\nfor worry in recent months. However deep the hatred\r\nborn of the recent or the distant past, reconciliation is the\r\nonly alternative. We appeal to the leaders and prominent\r\ncitizens of these countries to unite their efforts to broaden\r\nthe base of political power and to stand firm against\r\nextremists. Only when these conditions are met can\r\nemergency aid make way for durable reconstruction.\r\nNaturally, my country will contribute to each stage of this\r\nrenewal.\r\nThe civil war in the former Yugoslavia has cast first\r\nEurope and then the entire world into profound disarray.\r\nYet for more than three years now, we have been\r\nworking relentlessly to put an end to this tragedy. The\r\nUnited Nations Protection Force has become one of the\r\nlargest peace-keeping missions ever set up by our\r\nOrganization. The United Nations and the European\r\nUnion have worked together tirelessly to find a negotiated\r\nsolution. The main Powers have now added their weight\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nto these efforts. Let us hope that the latest attempt by the\r\nEuropean Union, the United States and the Russian\r\nFederation will finally succeed in halting the bloodshed.\r\nFrom this rostrum I call upon the parties to seize this\r\nopportunity: put an end to madness and let peace return.\r\nI have just touched upon two cases of civil war where\r\nracial hatred has led to particularly inhumane behaviour.\r\nMore than ever, we must remain unyielding when human\r\nrights are systematically violated. We must aim to banish\r\nevery regime that is based on practices of \"ethnic\r\ncleansing\".\r\nSo that this lesson may never be forgotten, Belgium\r\nfavours the establishment of an international penal\r\njurisdiction and expresses the wish that the international\r\ncommunity do whatever is necessary to render it\r\noperational as soon as possible. In the meantime, we\r\nbelieve that the Tribunal created to judge the war crimes\r\nperpetrated in the former Yugoslavia will stand as a\r\nvaluable precedent, which we would like to see extended to\r\nthe crimes committed in Rwanda as soon as possible.\r\nAlong the same lines, my Government welcomes the\r\nappointment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nThe operational initiatives launched by Mr. Ayala Lasso -\r\nsending human rights monitors to Rwanda, for instance -\r\nhave received early and concrete support from Belgium,\r\namong others. I am convinced that Mr. Ayala Lasso’s\r\nactions will strengthen the respect for human rights and\r\npromote a successful dialogue among political leaders and\r\nhuman rights activists in every part of the world. This\r\ndialogue will take into account the differing approaches\r\ninspired by various cultures and religions, but in my\r\nopinion, it would lose its meaning if it were to compromise\r\non the one essential point: the respect owed to the physical\r\nand moral integrity of every human being.\r\nFor Belgium, the crisis in Rwanda has marked the\r\ninternational agenda. In the wake of the genocide, death\r\nlashed out blindly at a population in exile, pushing back the\r\nlimits of horror already reached in Bosnia and Somalia.\r\nMy fellow citizens were deeply troubled by the ruin of so\r\nmany efforts of development, the failure of so many\r\nattempts at reconciliation. The savage killing of 10 Belgian\r\n\"blue helmets\", who were among the 100 United Nations\r\npeace-keepers slain since the beginning of this year,\r\nhighlights the unmistakable fragility of peace-keeping\r\noperations. I believe the best way to honour all those who\r\nlost their lives is by reflecting in particular upon the limits\r\nand possibilities of international action.\r\nIn this regard, the common experience in which\r\nBelgium took part - in the former Yugoslavia, in Somalia\r\nand in Rwanda - has enabled us, sometimes in tragic\r\ncircumstances, to make a number of observations for\r\nfuture use. I intend to group them around four principles\r\nthat seem to me essential. First: peace-keeping\r\noperations cannot be improvised. Second: once decided,\r\nthey should be given the means to achieve their aims.\r\nThird: for these means to function fully, we should\r\nensure their operational and political coherence. And,\r\nfinally, as long as the security of the personnel involved\r\ncannot be guaranteed, it will become increasingly difficult\r\nto find troop contributors for peace-keeping missions,\r\nwhich will thereby reduce them to a purely theoretical\r\ninstrument.\r\nFirst, the principle of \"non-improvisation\" implies\r\ntwo things.\r\nThe first is that the Organization must at all times be\r\nable to mobilize the necessary means for a peace-keeping\r\noperation and to this end rely on the solidarity of all its\r\nmembers. This means that it is essential to reinforce the\r\nmilitary peace-keeping capacity of the Organization. In\r\nthe absence of a United Nations multilateral force that can\r\nbe deployed quickly, generalized offers of stand-by troops\r\nand equipment and standardization of equipment and\r\nprocedures are objectives we must pursue diligently. To\r\nthis end I have sent the Secretary-General a list of\r\npossible Belgian contributions which could be made\r\navailable for peace-keeping operations.\r\nThe second implication is that, even though\r\nsolidarity remains the basis for conceiving and\r\nimplementing peace-keeping, this solidarity cannot be\r\nblind and automatic. Each specific operation must be the\r\nresult of careful consideration.\r\nThe launching of a new peace-keeping operation\r\nshould only be envisaged and seriously considered when\r\nall other means of solving the crisis have been exhausted,\r\nincluding at the regional level. Chapter VI, as well as\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\", offer a wide choice of\r\ninstruments for solving a crisis through negotiation,\r\narbitration, and so on. Those who forget that\r\npeace-keeping operations are not a panacea do the\r\nOrganization a disservice and often unwittingly contribute\r\nto making situations worse rather than solving them.\r\nOnce it has been decided by the Security Council, a\r\npeace-keeping operation becomes everybody’s business.\r\nAll Member States must contribute according to their\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\npossibilities and as circumstances dictate. Of course,\r\nMember States must retain the sovereign right to decide\r\nwhether or not to participate in a given peace-keeping\r\noperation, but in so doing, they should look beyond the\r\ncriterion of national interest.\r\nAll States should cooperate actively with a view to the\r\nsuccess of the operation by facilitating its movements,\r\nsupplies, reinforcements and the prepositioning of reserve\r\ntroops. All States should use their diplomatic influence to\r\nhelp the Secretary-General achieve the political objectives\r\nof an operation. And, finally, all States must adhere to\r\ntheir financial obligations with respect to an operation.\r\nSecondly, a peace-keeping operation must be based on\r\nthe consent of the parties, appropriate flexibility and\r\nadequate information.\r\nEvery operation must be based on consensus among\r\nthe States legitimately involved. The conflicting parties\r\nthemselves must agree to the deployment and aims of the\r\noperation, except in the case of an obvious humanitarian\r\ncatastrophe. In this all-too-frequent case, the Security\r\nCouncil’s decision to act outside the framework of the\r\ntraditional mandate and disregard the three usual\r\nconditions - in other words, agreement by the parties, the\r\npolitical process and a cease-fire - must be taken with great\r\ncare. The Council must express this decision clearly in the\r\nmandate and accept all its consequences.\r\nAn operation must at all times have the strength\r\nnecessary to execute its mission safely. This rule is of\r\nutmost importance. It implies, to begin with, sufficient\r\nmanpower and flexible rules of engagement to respond to\r\nthe unexpected. It also implies adequate equipment to fulfil\r\nthe mandate and to react to emergencies. The deployment\r\nof a military reserve in the vicinity has already proven its\r\nusefulness, for example, in Somalia. It is a precautionary\r\nmeasure we should envisage more often in the future. As\r\na rule, a force subject to local provocation must always\r\nhave the choice between evacuating or remaining in place,\r\nbetween retreat or riposte.\r\nBut the use of force is not the first option to be\r\nconsidered in order to discourage resistance to a\r\npeace-keeping operation. Education and persuasion will do\r\nmiracles among populations that are often ill-informed or\r\neven misguided about the objectives of a peace-keeping\r\noperation. Experience has shown that it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to develop a coherent information strategy. Each\r\npeace-keeping operation should be provided with an\r\ninformation unit and a radio transmitter to broadcast its\r\nmessage. Moreover, the ability to neutralize hostile\r\npropaganda sources should be put to use each time this\r\npropaganda threatens the safety of part of a population or\r\nUnited Nations personnel.\r\nThe third consideration is that the cohesion of the\r\ncommand and control structures and consultations on a\r\nregular basis with troop-contributing countries are\r\nconditions essential to the success of an operation.\r\nThe military and political control of an operation\r\nmust rest with the United Nations or with a duly\r\nmandated body. This principle has two consequences.\r\nAny attempt by the Commander of the Force or of\r\na small contingent to report directly only to national\r\nauthorities will reduce the cohesion of the multilateral\r\noperation. The flexibility required by a commander in the\r\nfield to deal with the unexpected, however, is a different\r\nmatter.\r\nWhen an action is undertaken by a regional or\r\nmultilateral force it must be authorized by the Security\r\nCouncil. However, this authorization should not reduce\r\nthe operational autonomy of the commanders of such an\r\noperation. Those who take the risk must be in control.\r\nMoreover, for each operation a consultation\r\ncommittee should be created in which troop contributors,\r\nthe members of the Security Council and the Secretariat\r\ncan meet at regular intervals. This committee will enable\r\nthe contributors better to assist the Secretariat in\r\nmanaging the operation.\r\nIt will also generate a real dialogue between\r\ncontributors and the members of the Council, each time\r\nthe latter prepare to take a decision which modifies the\r\nbasic conditions of the operation. Contributors often have\r\na better knowledge of the situation in the field and are\r\nbest placed to judge whether a new task is feasible or\r\nacceptable. Without troop contributors the resolutions of\r\nthe Council would remain ineffectual.\r\nAs a fourth and last consideration, the security of the\r\nblue helmets is as much a concern of the contributing\r\ncountries as of the Secretariat. The prosecution of those\r\nwho attack the peace-keeping forces must be efficiently\r\norganized.\r\nThe responsibility of a Government for its contingent\r\ndoes not stop with its dispatch to the field of operations.\r\nThe contributing country has the right to watch over the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nsafety of its compatriots at all times. Ultimately, security\r\nmust be the decisive factor for a contributing country to\r\ncontinue or suspend its participation in a peace-keeping\r\noperation.\r\nIt seems normal, therefore, that a troop contributor\r\nshould be entitled to equip its contingent from the start with\r\nsufficient defensive armament. Later, when unexpected\r\ncircumstances place the contingent in a situation of real\r\ndanger, the Security Council and the Secretary-General\r\nmust immediately adapt the mandate and, if necessary, the\r\nrules of engagement to that situation.\r\nIt is a fundamental duty of the United Nations to\r\norganize the international prosecution of those who attack\r\nUnited Nations personnel. The impunity granted so far to\r\nthe perpetrators of such crimes gives rise to an uneasy\r\nfeeling and undermines the credibility of the United Nations\r\nin the eyes of world opinion. The authority of our\r\nOrganization over those whom it is trying to reconcile is\r\nnegatively affected by this, and the Governments that\r\ncontribute troops are increasingly worried. In our opinion,\r\nit is essential to speed up the adoption of a convention on\r\nthe security of United Nations personnel, as well as of the\r\ninvestigations and the effective prosecution of those who\r\nattack our personnel.\r\nI hope that these thoughts that I have shared with the\r\nAssembly will contribute to improving the procedures and\r\nreinforcing the means put into effect by our Organization to\r\nface up to the new situations that it needs to tackle. In\r\nfact, these changes deserve to be formalized when any\r\nrevision of the Charter takes place. The functioning of the\r\npeace-keeping operations would be greatly improved by\r\nthis.\r\nAlexis de Tocqueville wrote:\r\n\"Amongst the laws that govern human societies, there\r\nis one that seems clearer and more precise than all\r\nothers. If men are to remain civilized, or become so,\r\nthe art of association must grow and improve at the\r\nsame rate as the equality of their conditions\".\r\nThough this \"art of association\" affects civil societies in the\r\nfirst place, it is also, and more than ever, a concern of our\r\nsociety of Governments. Launching peace-keeping\r\noperations is without doubt a most generous expression of\r\nthis art of acting together.\r\nIn the meantime, the fact that we have been able to\r\nmultiply peace-keeping operations in difficult political,\r\nfinancial and material circumstances is nothing short of\r\nmiraculous and prompts us to pay tribute to all the people\r\nwho have been working tirelessly within the Secretariat as\r\nwell as in the field.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, Mr.\r\nYohei Kono.\r\nMr. Kono (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Allow me to begin my\r\naddress by offering my congratulations to Mr. Amara\r\nEssy on the assumption of his new office. I should also\r\nlike to express my respect for the excellent diplomatic\r\nskills demonstrated by his predecessor, Ambassador\r\nInsanally, during a period of momentous change. I am\r\nalso pleased to convey my sincere congratulations to the\r\nRepublic of South Africa, which, having renounced\r\napartheid, was reinstated as a full Member of the United\r\nNations at the previous session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe United Nations is now expected to play a\r\ngreater role than ever before. Recalling the blessings\r\nbestowed upon Japan by the international community at\r\nthe time of its admission into this Organization, I intend\r\nto conduct a proactive foreign policy that will enable\r\nJapan to contribute, on a level commensurate with its\r\npolitical and economic status, to the future well-being of\r\nhumankind.\r\nAt the outset, I should like to discuss Japan’s basic\r\nphilosophy regarding its international contributions. Japan\r\nis engaged in economic assistance and various other\r\nefforts in order to eradicate poverty and achieve economic\r\ndevelopment, as well as to prevent conflicts and remove\r\ndestabilizing factors.\r\nReflecting with remorse upon the Second World\r\nWar, Japan has never wavered from its commitment to\r\ncontribute to world peace and prosperity. Japan does not,\r\nnor will it, resort to the use of force, prohibited by its\r\nConstitution. Japan will remain resolutely a nation of\r\npeace. Neither possessing nuclear arms nor exporting\r\nweapons, Japan continues to be actively engaged in\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation efforts. In accordance\r\nwith what I have just stated, Japan has dispatched\r\nmembers of its Self-Defence Forces, as well as civilian\r\npersonnel, to several countries, including Cambodia and\r\nMozambique, in response to requests by the United\r\nNations. Japan intends to continue to cooperate actively\r\nin such United Nations peace-keeping operations.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nAt the same time, Japan is determined to enhance its\r\ncontributions to efforts on global issues in economic and\r\nsocial areas. These issues, whose importance is now\r\nwidely recognized, include development, the environment,\r\nhuman rights, refugees, population, AIDS and narcotics.\r\nToday, the first area on which the United Nations\r\nshould focus its efforts is the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security; the second is the resolution of economic\r\nand social problems. And if it is to carry out these two\r\nvery important tasks effectively, it must undertake a third:\r\nthe promotion of United Nations reform. I should like on\r\nthis occasion to outline my views as to the kind of\r\ncontributions Japan wishes to make in these areas.\r\nIn the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nwhich is the first area of concern to the United Nations,\r\nJapan places great emphasis on disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation, diplomatic efforts for the resolution of\r\nconflicts, and peace-keeping operations.\r\nAs the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack,\r\nand adhering firmly to its three non-nuclear principles,\r\nJapan strives to achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating all\r\nnuclear weapons. Toward this end, it urges all\r\nnuclear-weapon States to redouble their efforts to reduce\r\ntheir nuclear arsenals. Further, Japan supports the\r\nindefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty,\r\nand calls on all States that have not yet acceded to the\r\nTreaty to do so at the earliest opportunity.\r\nAt the same time, I would urge, in particular, all\r\nnuclear-weapon States to engage more actively in the\r\nnegotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty and to\r\nstrive to bring them to an early and successful conclusion.\r\nI wish to propose that, once the negotiations on the treaty\r\nare concluded, a ceremony for its signing by Heads of State\r\nor Government be held in Japan, for example in the city of\r\nHiroshima, and that it be made a new starting-point for the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons once and for all.\r\nIn this connection, Japan strongly calls upon North\r\nKorea to engage seriously in efforts to resolve the issue of\r\nits development of nuclear weapons through international\r\ndialogue, including its talks with the United States.\r\nThe unfettered transfer and excessive accumulation of\r\nconventional weapons is another destabilizing factor in\r\nmany regions of the world today. In the civil wars we have\r\nwitnessed in certain regions of Africa and elsewhere, for\r\nexample, it has resulted in the escalation of combat and in\r\nenormous loss of life. It is my belief that the international\r\ncommunity must seriously consider concrete measures to\r\nsolve this problem.\r\nIn this regard, the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms, designed to improve the transparency\r\nof arms transfers, has grown increasingly important as an\r\neffective measure for building confidence at the global\r\nlevel. More than 80 countries participate in the Register\r\nat present, and we strongly hope that many more will\r\njoin. Japan will work together with other Member States\r\nto amplify and strengthen the Register by, for example,\r\nalso including arms stockpiles in it.\r\nThe prevention and settlement of regional conflicts\r\nrequires a comprehensive approach which combines\r\ndiplomatic efforts, United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations, humanitarian aid, assistance for building social\r\ninstitutions, and aid for peace-building, such as\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction assistance.\r\nConvinced of the importance of taking measures\r\nbefore conflicts become intractable, I am a strong\r\nadvocate of the vigorous promotion of preventive\r\ndiplomacy. From this viewpoint, I believe we should, in\r\ncooperation with the countries concerned, actively\r\nconsider extending assistance for the stabilization of\r\nsocial and political conditions in regions or countries\r\nwhere there are elements of instability.\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations have\r\nproved successful in Cambodia and many other regions,\r\nand they are expected to play an increasingly important\r\nrole. Further improvement of the effectiveness of\r\npeace-keeping operations will require closer examination\r\nof, inter alia, their mandates, duration, scale of activities\r\nand cost, as well as full consideration of the safety of\r\npersonnel. Strengthening the financial base of United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations is an urgent task. It is\r\nnecessary, in particular, that Member States that are in\r\narrears pay their assessed contributions. It is also\r\nimperative that ways be sought to put peace-keeping\r\noperations on a sounder financial basis.\r\nJapan, for its part, will enhance its support for\r\ndemocratization with a view to helping peace take root\r\nafter the fighting has ceased. It places particular\r\nimportance on assisting efforts to hold free and fair\r\nelections.\r\nResponding to the unspeakably tragic situation of the\r\nRwandan refugees, Japan has provided both financial\r\nassistance and material support through the United\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United\r\nNations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. The Government\r\nof Japan has decided to dispatch more than 400 members\r\nof its self-defence forces to the region to provide assistance\r\nin such areas as medical treatment, water supply and air\r\ntransport. Some of these activities have already\r\ncommenced. Working together with the international\r\ncommunity - particularly with the countries of Africa -\r\nJapan is determined to continue its efforts toward a solution\r\nof the Rwandan issue.\r\nWith regard to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nJapan continues to support the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to restore peace. It calls upon all the disputing\r\nparties concerned to accept the peace plan for Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina devised by the Contact Group and to cooperate\r\nwith the activities of the United Nations there.\r\nThe second task of the United Nations is the solution\r\nof problems in economic and social areas, including those\r\nregarding development, the environment and human rights.\r\nWith the changing international circumstances, the\r\nissue of development is now re-emerging as a global\r\nconcern; a new strategy for development is thus called for.\r\nIt is from this viewpoint that Japan has been advocating a\r\ndevelopment strategy that entails a comprehensive\r\napproach, combining assistance, trade, investment, and the\r\ntransfer of technology, as well as a differentiated approach,\r\ntailored to the needs of developing countries according to\r\ntheir respective stages of development.\r\nThe International Conference on African Development,\r\nheld in Tokyo last year, proved to be a worthwhile forum\r\nfor the discussion of how such a development strategy\r\nmight be realized. In an effort to build upon the results of\r\nthat Conference, an Asia-Africa seminar will be convened\r\nin Indonesia this December.\r\nIn today’s world, South-South cooperation, where\r\nmore advanced developing countries share their experience\r\nand technology with other developing countries, is of\r\nincreasing significance. Japan intends to suggest concrete\r\nplans for the promotion of South-South cooperation around\r\nthe globe.\r\nMoreover, as the world’s largest donor country, Japan\r\ncontinues its efforts to expand its official development\r\nassistance. In extending such assistance, it gives full\r\nconsideration to such factors as trends in the recipient\r\ncountry’s military expenditures and in its development and\r\nproduction of weapons of mass destruction, as well as its\r\nefforts to promote democracy and to introduce a\r\nmarket-oriented economy.\r\nIt is my hope that meaningful discussions of an\r\nAgenda for Development will take place at the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly and that the points I\r\nhave just mentioned will be taken into account.\r\nAt this time of increasing global interdependence, all\r\nhumankind is confronted with new challenges, such as\r\nenvironmental and population problems, which can be\r\novercome only through close cooperative efforts between\r\nindustrialized and developing countries.\r\nJapan, for its part, is actively engaged in\r\nenvironmental- protection efforts. For example, it is\r\nworking to strengthen the international framework for\r\nsuch efforts, to transfer relevant technologies to\r\ndeveloping countries, and to expand and strengthen its\r\nofficial development assistance in environmental areas.\r\nWith regard to population and AIDS, in February of this\r\nyear Japan launched its Global Issues Initiative, under\r\nwhich it is greatly expanding assistance to developing\r\ncountries to address these problems. At the International\r\nConference on Population and Development, recently\r\nconvened in Cairo, I stressed the importance of finding a\r\nsolution to issues relating to population.\r\nJapan is profoundly aware that human-resources\r\ndevelopment and the further advancement of the status of\r\nwomen, achieved through international cooperation, have\r\nimportant implications for social stability. We therefore\r\neagerly anticipate the successful outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women, which will be convened next\r\nyear. By the same token, Japan actively participates in\r\nthe Women-in-Development programmes and other social-\r\ndevelopment activities administered by the various United\r\nNations agencies.\r\nEconomic development and human rights may be\r\nlikened to the front and rear wheels of a vehicle: they\r\nmust work in tandem to advance the development of\r\ndemocratic societies. In order to encourage respect for\r\nhuman rights as universal values and to improve\r\neffectively the human rights situation in every country, it\r\nis important to make continuous efforts to establish legal\r\nsystems and to raise awareness of human rights, in\r\naddition to promoting political, economic and social\r\nstability. Toward this end, Japan will cooperate in every\r\nway possible to assist the work of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nIf it is to carry out effectively its two major tasks -\r\nmaintaining international peace and security and resolving\r\neconomic and social problems - the United Nations must\r\nmake a serious effort to adapt to the new era by\r\nundertaking structural reform as well as administrative and\r\nbudgetary reform.\r\nAs the United Nations seeks to strengthen its activities\r\nthrough reform, the restructuring of the Security Council is\r\nof particular importance. Today the activities of the\r\nSecurity Council span a wide range of issues relating to\r\nworld peace and stability. While the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations has grown from 51 countries in 1945 to 184\r\ncountries at the present time, the composition of the\r\nCouncil, which was intended to reflect the world situation\r\nas it existed when the United Nations was established, has\r\nremained virtually unchanged. In the interim, we have\r\nwitnessed the emergence of countries that are capable of\r\nshouldering greater international responsibilities. It is\r\ntherefore necessary to restructure and strengthen the\r\nSecurity Council, while ensuring its efficiency, so that it\r\nmay reflect world realities.\r\nIn keeping with Japan’s basic philosophy regarding\r\ninternational contributions, which I outlined earlier, I wish\r\nto state that Japan is prepared, with the endorsement of\r\nmany countries, to discharge its responsibilities as a\r\npermanent member of the Security Council. It is my hope\r\nthat United Nations Member States will accelerate the\r\ndeliberations on this subject during the current session and\r\nthat an agreement will be reached on a reform plan in time\r\nfor the commemorative fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly next year.\r\nThe Security Council is not the only organ requiring\r\nreform. The General Assembly, in which 184 States\r\nparticipate, also needs to be reinvigorated, and it must\r\ncoordinate its activities more closely with those of other\r\nUnited Nations agencies. Recently, efforts have begun to\r\nfine-tune United Nations activities in economic and social\r\nfields, such as development, the environment and human\r\nrights, and to establish clear priorities among them. In\r\naddressing these issues, which have profound implications\r\nfor the future of humankind, it is necessary to continue to\r\nwork towards the functional and organizational\r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council. The\r\nTrusteeship Council, by contrast, has completed its historic\r\nmission, and it is my view that it would be appropriate, in\r\nthe context of the reform of the United Nations as a whole,\r\nto consider its abolishment. Building on the creation of the\r\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services at the last session of\r\nthe General Assembly, we must redouble our efforts to\r\npromote administrative and budgetary reform.\r\nThe passage of a half century since the signing of\r\nthe United Nations Charter has rendered the so-called\r\n\"former enemy clauses\" meaningless. Japan continues to\r\nseek their deletion from the text of the Charter.\r\nI have focused my remarks today on the three\r\nchallenges facing the United Nations: the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the resolution of\r\neconomic and social issues and the need for the reform of\r\nthe Organization. If the United Nations pursues reform\r\nto meet the changing needs of the times and supports and\r\nexpands cooperation among its Member States, I have\r\nevery confidence that it will enhance its legitimacy as a\r\nuniversal organization and develop a capacity to respond\r\nto new challenges even more effectively.\r\nIn closing, I would like to call upon all Member\r\nStates to cooperate to ensure that this will be remembered\r\nas the historic session of the General Assembly that\r\nushered in a new era for the United Nations.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Portugal, His Excellency Mr. José\r\nManuel Durão Barroso.\r\nMr. Durão Barroso (Portugal) (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; English text furnished by the delegation): It\r\nis with pleasure that I warmly congratulate Mr. Amara\r\nEssy on his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session. In his election I see\r\na recognition of the role that Côte d’Ivoire, a friendly\r\nAfrican country, has played on the international scene as\r\nwell as an appreciation of his personal qualities and\r\nexperience.\r\nA word of recognition is also in order for the\r\noutgoing President, Ambassador Samuel Insanally, for his\r\ndedicated and positive service during the last session of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, I renew my homage for the secure and\r\ncommitted manner in which he is carrying out his\r\nmission. As he already knows, Portugal can be counted\r\non in the pursuit of the objectives of peace and\r\ndevelopment and in the consolidation of a substantial\r\nreform of the United Nations system.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nMy German colleague has already addressed the\r\nAssembly on behalf of the 12 member States of the\r\nEuropean Union, expressing positions to which Portugal\r\nfully subscribes. Nevertheless, I would like to reflect on\r\ncertain issues which are of particular importance to my\r\ncountry.\r\nThe end of the bipolar era has created, somewhat\r\nperversely, greater unpredictability and uncertainty in the\r\nsystem of collective security, which has most visibly led to\r\na rebirth of extreme nationalism and new focuses of\r\nconflict. In this perspective, I would like to underline the\r\nimportance we attach to cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations and mechanisms. Such\r\ncooperation implements the concept of complementary\r\nactions and allows for more agile solutions adapted to\r\nconcrete circumstances.\r\nThe road to stability and the progressive development\r\nof a new concept of security also passes through the\r\nstimulation of political institutions capable of guaranteeing\r\nrespect for universally recognized values. Similarly, greater\r\ninternational control of the use of force will require not\r\nonly the best and most adequate means but also a\r\nconstantly renewed political legitimacy in order to wield\r\nthem. In my view, this legitimacy is tied to the goal of\r\nbuilding an international society based on ideals which\r\npromote peace, democracy and human rights.\r\nWe must also keep in mind the socio-economic\r\ndimension of the issues that threaten international stability\r\nand security. More than ever, we need an integrated\r\napproach within which the preventive dimension is given\r\npriority, both in its purely political and diplomatic aspect\r\nand in its development-aid aspect.\r\nIn this context, we underline the importance of the\r\ncommitted participation of all nations in an Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, as the Secretary-General has invited us to do.\r\nToday more than ever, the portentous words of the Pope\r\nring true: \"Development is the new name of peace.\"\r\nIn this regard, we need to rethink, not only the role of\r\ndevelopment aid, but also the very concept of development.\r\nIt should become more comprehensive, including respect\r\nfor democratic values and human rights as well as social\r\nand economic issues and other issues related to the\r\npreservation of the environment, demographics, the\r\nprevention of endemic diseases and the fight against the\r\ntraffic in drugs.\r\nHere we must also underline the importance we\r\nattach to helping countries that are truly committed to\r\nimplementing social and politico-economic reforms\r\nconducive to sustainable development. However, such a\r\nprocess must be complemented by an increasingly liberal\r\ninternational system and by a set of measures that seek to\r\nreduce the burden of external debt and create the\r\nconditions for a reactivation of private investment in their\r\neconomies.\r\nIn this context, I welcome the signing in Marrakesh\r\nof the Uruguay Round agreements and the forthcoming\r\nstart-up of the World Trade Organization, which will\r\nallow for freer trade, with the simultaneous strengthening\r\nof rules and disciplines.\r\nAs a member of the European Union, Portugal\r\nfirmly defends the enlargement of the Union and the\r\nstrengthening of ties with other countries of Central and\r\nEastern Europe and the Mediterranean basin. For the\r\nentire continent, the European Union is undoubtedly an\r\nimmense consolidating force of democratic ideals,\r\nstability, prosperity and respect for human rights.\r\nOther organizations, such as the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO), the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Western\r\nEuropean Union (WEU) and the Council of Europe\r\ncontribute equally to the same ideals. If the\r\ndemocratization of Eastern Europe has created the\r\npossibility of future adhesions to the European Union, it\r\nhas also led to a new relationship as regards security on\r\nthe continent.\r\nWe understand the desire already expressed by many\r\ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe to join the\r\ndefence and security organizations, and we are ready to\r\nconsider, in due time, a gradual and balanced enlargement\r\nof NATO to include those States that share with us the\r\nsame democratic values and respect for human rights and\r\nthe rule of law. The question of the enlargement of\r\nNATO to the east cannot, however, overshadow the\r\nessential transatlantic dimension which must remain the\r\ncornerstone of European security. On the other hand, any\r\nincrease in the membership of NATO must not create\r\nnew divisions in Europe. Therefore, Portugal affirms that\r\nall the possibilities of the Partnership for Peace, a\r\nmechanism aimed at uniting countries of the Eurasian\r\nregion in activities of military cooperation, must be\r\npursued.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nLast year, I stated here that Portugal considers the\r\nnuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty fundamental for\r\ninternational security. As we approach the 1995\r\nConference I should like to reiterate the intention of my\r\nGovernment to support all efforts that will lead to the\r\nunconditional and indefinite extension of that instrument.\r\nWhile referring to security, I should like to welcome\r\nand support the initiative announced here yesterday by\r\nPresident Clinton to reach an agreement on reducing the\r\nproliferation of anti-personnel mines. Such an initiative\r\ncould not be more timely and, for our part, I can announce\r\nhere that Portugal is in the process of preparing legislation\r\nto outlaw the commercialization of those weapons and their\r\nproduction.\r\nIn the context of Europe, I cannot avoid referring to\r\nthe situation in the former Yugoslavia and, in particular, to\r\nthe terrible conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite all\r\nthe efforts applied towards bringing an end to that situation,\r\nwar goes on with its tragic fare of death, destruction and\r\nsuffering.\r\nThe international community has demonstrated that it\r\npossesses a common interest in the search for a political\r\nsolution to the conflict. We must, however, recognize that\r\nthis progress is insufficient and that, without real political\r\nwill shown by all parties directly involved, a stable and\r\nlong-lasting solution will never be found.\r\nPortugal has actively participated in the efforts of the\r\ninternational community with both men and matériel, and\r\nwill continue to remain on the ground for as long as it is\r\nuseful and necessary. We are, in fact, reinforcing the\r\nPortuguese contingent in the area within the activities of the\r\nWestern European Union (WEU).\r\nSub-Saharan Africa, to which my country is linked by\r\nparticularly strong cultural and historical ties, continues to\r\nbe the region of the planet with the most worrying levels of\r\ndevelopment. Portugal has defended the idea that the\r\ninternational community should grant Africa first priority,\r\ncommensurate with the unparalleled magnitude of the\r\nproblems that need to be overcome. But firstly, Africans\r\nthemselves must prove that underdevelopment is not\r\ninevitable. And the greatest contribution that they can\r\nmake in this direction is a determined commitment to\r\nsearch for peaceful solutions to both existing and potential\r\nconflicts, and a continued deepening of the process of\r\npolitical and social democratization on the continent, as\r\nwell as the adoption of indispensable economic reforms.\r\nThe first free and democratic elections in South\r\nAfrica and the investiture of Nelson Mandela as its Head\r\nof State, as well as the formation of a Government of\r\nnational unity, represent historic achievements not only\r\nbecause they have left apartheid behind but also because\r\nthey have proved the viability of finding in Africa\r\npeaceful solutions to complex situations. Portugal, which\r\nactively participated in all efforts to support the process\r\nof democratic transition in that country, warmly salutes\r\nthe new South Africa, a country which is host to an\r\nimportant Portuguese community. We believe that the\r\nhuman, economic and technological potential of that\r\ncountry can undoubtedly constitute an important factor for\r\neconomic recovery in all of southern Africa.\r\nIn Mozambique also there are signs that the hopes of\r\nits people with regard to the peace process will not be\r\ndisappointed. The completion of the cantonment and\r\ndemobilization processes, the formation, despite some\r\ndelays, of the new armed forces and the peaceful manner\r\nin which the electoral campaign has been conducted are\r\nall crucial achievements to be recognized, and foretell the\r\ncoming elections of 27 and 28 October 1994 as being a\r\ncrucial moment for the future of Mozambique.\r\nWe appeal to the main Mozambican political forces\r\nto find the forms of dialogue and understanding\r\nconducive to guaranteeing a true national reconciliation\r\nwith full respect for democratic principles.\r\nPortugal was an observer at the negotiations and is\r\nrepresented in all the commissions created by the peace\r\naccord, playing a major role in the formation of the new\r\narmy, as well as participating significantly in the United\r\nNations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ).\r\nPortugal will remain committed to following this\r\nprocess closely in the context of the accords and we\r\nconsider it important that the international community\r\nsupport Mozambique not only during this particular phase\r\nbut also in what we hope will be the following stage of\r\nnational reconstruction and reconciliation.\r\nIn southern Africa, one of the longest, and surely\r\ndeadliest, conflicts the world has ever known rages on.\r\nAngola continues to be the stage for a war that has\r\nalready claimed hundreds of thousands of innocent\r\nvictims.\r\nPortugal, as a member of the troika of observer\r\ncountries, will continue to do all it can in actively\r\nsupporting the United Nations mediation in the person of\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General, whose\r\nefforts I take this opportunity to salute, in the search for a\r\ndefinitive solution to the Angolan conflict.\r\nThe international community cannot and must not\r\nforget the origins of the current conflict, which frustrated\r\nthe hopes of the Angolan people created after the Bicesse\r\naccords and the elections of September 1992. Beyond\r\nattributing blame, it is now more important not to give up\r\nthe efforts to bring this terrible conflict to an end.\r\nThe Lusaka negotiations, which seek to promote -\r\nwithin the context of respect for the peace accords and\r\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council - a genuine\r\nreconciliation in Angola, have reached a crucial stage.\r\nThe complete acceptance by the Angolan Government\r\nand UNITA of the set of proposals of the mediation on\r\nnational reconciliation constitutes an important step.\r\nUNAVEM II must be given the necessary means to\r\ncomplete its mission. For this to happen, appropriate forces\r\nmust be placed on the ground immediately following the\r\ninitialling of the accords and the correct dimensions of that\r\npeace-keeping operation must be defined.\r\nIn any case, peace will not be possible unless there is\r\na genuine will on the part of the Angolans themselves.\r\nI appeal here to the Angolan Government and UNITA\r\nto do all in their power so that this opportunity is not lost.\r\nI also appeal to the international community to\r\nredouble its commitment and support.\r\nDespite the continuation of the conflict in Angola, the\r\nhistorical changes under way in southern Africa offer\r\npossibilities which must be consolidated and developed.\r\nPortugal has from the very beginning supported the\r\nproject for a dialogue between the European Union and that\r\nregion of Africa, an idea that has just been expressed in the\r\nrecent Berlin Conference between the European Union and\r\nthe Southern African Development Community (SADC).\r\nAs was stated in the Berlin Declaration, the aim of this\r\ndialogue is, inter alia, the promotion and development of\r\ntrade, investment and cooperation, in order to stimulate a\r\nbalanced development of that region which may, in turn,\r\nprovide an engine for progress in the rest of the continent.\r\nThe dramatic situation in Rwanda shows how\r\nimportant the role of the Organization of African Unity is\r\nin the prevention of similar situations, namely through the\r\nimplementation of its mechanism for the prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts created last year\r\non 29 July at the Cairo Summit. From the very\r\nbeginning, Portugal has supported the creation of this\r\nmechanism and, in conjunction with African and other\r\nlike-minded countries, is prepared to participate actively\r\nin the search for means that will permit the empowerment\r\nof such an instrument.\r\nI cannot end this reference to Africa without\r\nwelcoming the way in which the first democratic and free\r\nelections were held in Guinea-Bissau and expressing\r\nsatisfaction at the peaceful and orderly climate that has\r\ncharacterized the campaign for the elections in Sao Tome\r\nand Principe, to be held in a few days.\r\nOne of the current priorities of our foreign policy is\r\nthe convergence of efforts with those countries which\r\nshare with us the Portuguese language. With them we are\r\nbuilding a community which I am sure will come to\r\nrepresent a new and exemplary political reality.\r\nWe are also seeking to deepen the political dialogue\r\nand cooperation between Europe and Latin America.\r\nThat cooperation is institutionalized in its own\r\nmechanisms, among which I single out the dialogue\r\nbetween the European Union and the Rio Group as well\r\nas the Ibero-American Summits. These in turn have\r\nallowed open and profound discussions of political\r\nquestions of common interest to countries united by close\r\nhistorical and cultural ties and by shared sensitivities.\r\nThis is what happened, once again, at the Summit in\r\nCartagena, Colombia.\r\nI am glad to be able to acknowledge here the clear\r\nevolution towards democracy and respect for human\r\nrights that has occurred in all of Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean. That very positive evolution contrasts even\r\nmore strongly with such shocking situations as that of\r\nHaiti, a country where conditions are being created for\r\nthe re-establishment of democratic constitutional order\r\nfollowing the intervention of a multinational force\r\nauthorized by the United Nations Security Council.\r\nPortugal continues to devote special attention to the\r\nevolution of the situation in North Africa. To that end,\r\nwe have advocated a rapprochement with the countries of\r\nthat area in accordance with the Lisbon Declaration of the\r\nEuropean Council, which, I recall, defined a new concept\r\nfor a political, economic, social and cultural relationship\r\nbetween the European Union and the Maghreb.\r\nFollowing the Corfu meeting of the European Council,\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nwhich attached particular importance to stability and\r\nsecurity in the Mediterranean, we reaffirm our dedication to\r\na dialogue and a deepening of ties with the countries of the\r\nregion. Nor can we defend any other approach when we\r\nconsider the geographical proximity and close historical ties\r\nthat unite Portugal and North Africa.\r\nIn fact, it is important that the countries of both sides\r\nof the Mediterranean deepen their dialogue so that we can\r\navoid the spread of an idea which we reject - that of\r\nconflict between civilizations. On the contrary, we should\r\nvalue the concept that countries with different political\r\nideas and whose populations espouse diverse religions are\r\nable to establish ties of trust and true cooperation.\r\nIt is my opinion that we have today well-founded\r\nreasons to believe that a comprehensive peace in the Middle\r\nEast will be a reality in the not-too-distant future. The\r\naccords already signed between Israel and the Palestinians\r\non the one hand and Israel and Jordan on the other testify\r\nto their determination in seeking a comprehensive, just and\r\nlasting peace. The achievements already made will\r\ncertainly serve as a catalyst for new initiatives. From this\r\nperspective, the decisions and resolutions of the United\r\nNations should reflect the positive developments already\r\nregistered.\r\nIt is also necessary that the international community,\r\nand in particular the countries of the region, support the\r\nefforts under way. We hope that progress in the peace\r\nprocess, in both its bilateral and multilateral aspects,\r\nforeshadows the capacity to generate a new era of stability\r\nand development in that part of the world.\r\nUniversalism has always marked the ideas and\r\nbehaviour of the Portuguese. In Asia Portugal has\r\ncenturies-old ties with a number of countries which we\r\nwish to maintain and develop. It is with great admiration\r\nthat we look upon the development of some areas of that\r\ncontinent. We are certain that the countries of that region\r\nwill have ever-increasing importance in the determination\r\nof the fate of our planet.\r\nPortugal attaches the greatest importance to respect for\r\nhuman rights, so much so that this respect can be\r\nconsidered to be a major pillar of its foreign policy. Our\r\naction has as a fixed reference point the results of the\r\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights, which rejected\r\nany regression or reduction of the established norms. We\r\nsupport the work of the High Commissioner and the Centre\r\nfor Human Rights, both of which should be granted the\r\nnecessary financial means for an efficient exercise of their\r\nfunctions.\r\nWe defend with particular commitment the principle\r\nof universality when applied to respect for human rights\r\nand their indivisibility, and we oppose any attempt to\r\nsubordinate their strict observance to other objectives. On\r\nthis issue, we cannot and must not yield. We believe that\r\ndemocracy, respect for human rights and development are\r\nmutually reinforcing.\r\nWe attach the greatest importance to the\r\ninternational conferences to be held in 1995: the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and the World\r\nConference on Women. We consider promising the\r\npositive results recently achieved in Cairo by the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nwhich we welcome.\r\nIn the context of human rights, among which this\r\nOrganization has always included with special distinction\r\nthe right to self-determination, I feel duty-bound to touch\r\nupon a question to which the international community has\r\nbeen giving growing attention. I am referring to the\r\nNon-Self-Governing Territory of East Timor. I reaffirm\r\nbefore this Assembly that Portugal has no specific\r\nobjective concerning the question of East Timor beyond\r\nthe defence of the rights of its people and the conclusion\r\nof the process of decolonizing the Territory in accordance\r\nwith international law and with full respect for the\r\nlegitimate rights of the Timorese people. For this reason,\r\nwe remain committed to talks that, under the auspices of\r\nthe Secretary-General, are being held with the Indonesian\r\nGovernment with the aim of finding a just,\r\ncomprehensive and internationally acceptable solution.\r\nUndoubtedly, progress has been slow and we have\r\nnot advanced on the substance of the matter. But, as a\r\nreading of the progress report of the Secretary-General\r\nreveals - and I must express here a word of appreciation\r\nto him - some steps have been taken, not only through the\r\nso-called confidence-building measures, but also with the\r\ninvolvement of the Timorese themselves in the search for\r\na solution to a problem in which they are the principal\r\ninterested party.\r\nEast Timor has recently ceased to be an almost\r\nforgotten Territory. We sincerely hope that the growing\r\nattention that has been granted it will contribute\r\ndecisively to an improvement in the concrete situation of\r\nits people and to the adoption of a more coherent attitude\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nin the recognition and defence of their legitimate and\r\ninalienable rights.\r\nOn 16 November the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea will come into force, culminating a long and important\r\nprocess which will open new and determinant channels of\r\naction and cooperation. The importance of this area will\r\nclearly justify the General Assembly’s adopting by\r\nconsensus the draft resolution of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil on the proclamation of 1998 as the international\r\nyear of the oceans. We are confident that its proclamation\r\nwill contribute in an effective manner to a wider debate and\r\na greater enlightenment of world public opinion on the\r\nimportance of the problems which we face in this area, thus\r\nenabling the adoption of solutions that will permit their\r\nresolution at a global level. Portugal actively participates\r\nin this debate, seeking with the holding of Lisbon\r\nExpo/98 - the last great exposition of the twentieth century,\r\nthe subject-matter of which is directly related to this area -\r\nto provide an important instrument for the achievement of\r\nthe goals we have set.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reflect upon the\r\ninstitutional reforms that are so necessary for adapting the\r\nOrganization to the new international context, its challenges\r\nand the greater possibilities of global cooperation. These\r\nreforms, which we believe to be essential and urgent,\r\nshould be carried out with transparency and on a consensual\r\nbasis. They must be realistic and be aimed at increasing\r\nefficiency.\r\nAlthough we are still at a preliminary stage, we\r\nconsider it useful to state here the aim of our thinking on\r\nthis matter. First of all, we believe that it is necessary to\r\nreinforce the efficiency and responsibility of the Security\r\nCouncil. We maintain that a third category of members\r\nshould not be created beyond those of permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members. A pragmatic and reasonable\r\nsolution to ensure greater representation on the Council\r\nwould be to increase the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers by one for each region. We are also of the\r\nopinion that the number of permanent members should be\r\nincreased, but such an increase should not be achieved at\r\nthe expense of the number of non-permanent members.We\r\nencourage regional agreements which, through increased\r\nrotation, will permit greater representation on the Council.\r\nIt is crucial that permanent members of the Council should\r\nhave the ability and the political will to assume fully the\r\nresponsibilities that come with that status as regards the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nSome States have declared themselves ready to\r\nassume greater responsibilities in regard to the\r\nachievement of the objectives of the Charter. The\r\nPortuguese Government declares - here today - its support\r\nfor the inclusion of Germany and Japan as permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. Both the unified\r\nGermany, a country that provided a notable incentive for\r\nthe construction of the European Union, and Japan, a\r\ngreat Power of the Asia-Pacific region, are in a position\r\nto make an effective contribution towards increasing the\r\nweight and the efficiency of the Security Council. It\r\nwould however be difficult to comprehend if an increase\r\nin the number of the permanent members did not also\r\ninclude the southern hemisphere of our planet. In this\r\ncontext, and among the eligible countries, we point\r\nnaturally to Brazil, a founding Member of the United\r\nNations, the largest country in Latin America and a State\r\nthat has unequivocally abided by the principles of the\r\nCharter.\r\nPortugal is a candidate for a seat on the Security\r\nCouncil for the biennium which begins in 1997. Our\r\ncandidature reflects a position of profound commitment to\r\nthe main objectives of the United Nations as set out in the\r\nCharter. It reflects also our desire to contribute fully to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThus, Portugal reaffirms its commitment with regard\r\nto the objectives of the United Nations, which my country\r\nhas supported with increasing responsibility as an active\r\nparticipant in the different areas of the Organization and,\r\nparticularly, in the United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nWe are approaching the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Portugal will seek to emphasize\r\nthis commemoration and to ensure that its significance is\r\nunderstood by the public at large and, in particular, by\r\nyoung people.\r\nIn this celebration, we wish to contribute to\r\nrenewing our ideals and sparking people’s conscience in\r\norder to promote increased participation in the objectives\r\nestablished by the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn short, this means the creation of a greater\r\nsensitivity to the irreplaceable role of the United Nations\r\nin the resolution of the major issues faced by humanity at\r\nthe turn of the century.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister of State,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal and for Senegalese\r\nLiving Abroad.\r\nMr. Niasse (Senegal) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe international community is meeting once again,\r\nassembling the great diversity of the nations which are its\r\nmembers, to consider the state of the world and to chart the\r\npaths of progress for the 12 months that lie ahead.\r\nWe give thanks to God for having inspired the\r\ndelegations here present in their choice of His Excellency\r\nMr. Amara Essy, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the sisterly\r\nand friendly Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, as President of the\r\nAssembly at this session. His election is both an honour to\r\nhim personally and a tribute to his country inasmuch as the\r\nworld recognizes and acknowledges the great dedication of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire to everything affecting peace and\r\nunderstanding among people. It does so thanks to the\r\nvision of the late President Houphouët-Boigny, which\r\ncontinues to be carried on by his illustrious successor,\r\nPresident Henri Konan Bédié.\r\nThe personal joy and pride which I feel concerning\r\nhim as our friend and brother is shared by my entire\r\ndelegation as well as in Senegal which, since time\r\nimmemorial, has had numerous ties of friendship and\r\ncooperation with Côte d’Ivoire. Hence, the\r\nacknowledgement of his merits by the international\r\ncommunity was received and hailed in Senegal with the\r\nsame intensity as in Côte d’Ivoire. The President can count\r\non the support of the delegation of Senegal to contribute to\r\nthe success of his mission. The warmth of the\r\ncongratulations we extend to him today is equalled by the\r\npride which we feel at seeing him preside over the forty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe pay a tribute to his predecessor, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Guyana, Ambassador Insanally, for the\r\nskill and authority with which he guided the work of the\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session.\r\nI should like also to repeat our gratitude to our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the\r\nenergy and dedication which he continues to devote to his\r\noutstanding mission at the head of our Organization, a\r\nmission which he is carrying out with the same efficiency\r\nin an ever more difficult global context.\r\nFinally, allow me to thank delegations for the\r\nunanimous decision to elect the Permanent Representative\r\nof Senegal to the United Nations, Mr. Kéba Birane Cissé,\r\none of our most outstanding diplomats, as Chairman of\r\nthe Third Committee. In so doing this mission is\r\nentrusted to Senegal, whose dedication to human rights\r\nand to the other areas falling within the competence of\r\nthis important Committee, is known to all. Mr. Cissé and\r\nall of us intend to dedicate ourselves fully, together with\r\nthe other countries represented here, to ensure that the\r\nwork of the Third Committee is crowned with success.\r\nIf there are years which the history of the world\r\ncannot ignore, the twelve-month period that has just\r\nelapsed is doubtless among them. It has been extremely\r\nrich in events of great political significance characterized\r\nby the positive developments of the situation in South\r\nAfrica which saw the end of apartheid and which, only a\r\nfew months ago, saw the advent of a democratic Power.\r\nIt was also a period marked by the political and\r\npsychological upheavals that have taken place in Arab-\r\nIsraeli relations. In this context, we are gratified to see\r\nSouth Africa now occupying its rightful place in the\r\nfamily of nations.\r\nThe truth always wins in the end. It is in the name\r\nof that inevitable reality - which is the token of the\r\nultimate objective of just causes - that the chronic\r\nproblem of the Middle East - at the heart of which is the\r\nquestion of Palestine - has, since the Declaration of\r\nPrinciples of 13 September 1993 in Washington, seen\r\ndevelopments marked by the continued collapse of\r\nimportant panels of that psychological wall that has so\r\nlong divided Arabs and Israelis.\r\nThus, in the region which was the cradle of the\r\nsublime spiritual messages of the religions of the Book,\r\nsuch developments now justify hope - the hope of finally\r\nseeing the creation of a space for lasting coexistence\r\nbetween Israelis and Palestinians, between Israel and the\r\nArab countries, with genuine respect for the inalienable\r\nrights of the peoples and States of the entire region.\r\nThey justify the hope of seeing the establishment,\r\nbetween those States and peoples, of cooperation at all\r\npossible levels, to manage, together, their vital support\r\nsystems.\r\nIt is only fitting that in mentioning those hopes we\r\npay a tribute to all those involved in this positive\r\ndevelopment whose efforts have made possible the\r\nopening of this new window of opportunity on the\r\nconflict in the Middle East, especially the Palestinian and\r\nIsraeli leaders who, thanks to their political courage and\r\nsense of history, finally agreed to set out on this path\r\ntowards a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nIn again expressing to His Excellency President Yasser\r\nArafat Senegal’s support and admiration for the courage\r\nand political farsightedness which led him to keep a firm\r\ngrip on that olive branch of which he spoke here in 1974,\r\nI should like on behalf of Senegal to formulate the hope\r\nthat as he takes the additional steps necessary to reach an\r\noverall solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict all the other\r\naspects of this matter will be dealt with in accordance with\r\nthe positive trend of present developments, and that a\r\nsettlement will be reached in keeping with the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council.\r\nWe also wish wholeheartedly to extend these\r\ncongratulations and expressions of encouragement to the\r\nIsraeli Prime Minister, His Excellency Mr. Yitzak Rabin,\r\nand to his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Shimon Peres,\r\nfor their sustained efforts to achieve a settlement of the\r\nMiddle East crisis. Such efforts must be pursued, stepped\r\nup and encouraged.\r\nHowever, the past year, although marked by such\r\npositive and historic events, was not free from reasons for\r\nconcern and even, at times, despair. Indeed, despite our\r\nconstantly renewed efforts, a number of conflicts persist\r\nand are even sometimes becoming mired down in scenes of\r\nhorror we had hoped never against to witness.\r\nFrom Angola to Bosnia and Herzegovina, from Liberia\r\nto Somalia, and recently in Rwanda, we have received the\r\nechoes and images and witnessed the piercing horror of\r\npersistent crisis situations that leave us no choice other than\r\nto continue doggedly to strive for dialogue and concerted\r\naction to find lasting solutions based on equity, based on\r\njustice, based on law and based on the unshakeable will to\r\nlive finally in peace in a community made up of human\r\nbeings.\r\nIn the conflict situations on the African continent,\r\ntoday, more than ever before, machinery for the prevention,\r\nmanagement and settlement of African conflicts must be\r\nimplemented through respect for the various peace\r\nagreements that have been signed among factions that are,\r\nsadly, continuing to kill each other; our continent of Africa\r\nmust be committed once and for all to the only battle worth\r\nthe candle, namely, the battle for democratic development\r\nand the advancement of human rights.\r\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU) has\r\ndedicated itself to this task, and it has done so persistently\r\nand courageously. Today, it needs the support of the whole\r\nof the international community.\r\nThe question of Angola must be peacefully and\r\nfinally resolved in the spirit of the Lusaka negotiations,\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations. After having\r\nhailed the meritorious efforts undertaken by the\r\nauthorities in Luanda, we must launch another strong and\r\nconcrete appeal to UNITA to allow peace finally to reign\r\nin Angola.\r\nIn connection with the problems in Somalia and\r\nRwanda, I should like to recall certain specific facts\r\nconcerning the position that my country, Senegal, has\r\ntaken on these questions of such concern to everyone.\r\nIn Somalia, the peace so long sought by the\r\ninternational community can obviously come about only\r\nthrough an overall political settlement that would deal\r\nwith all aspects of that fratricidal conflict. Moreover,\r\nbecause he understood this at a very early stage, His\r\nExcellency President Abdou Diouf - then the Chairman of\r\nthe OAU, and also in his capacity of President of the\r\nSixth Summit Meeting of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference - speaking from this rostrum in 1992, put\r\nforward the idea of convening an international conference\r\ndevoted to Somalia. The General Assembly at that time\r\nresponded to the appeal by the Senegalese Head of State\r\nby adopting a resolution to that effect that is still highly\r\nrelevant. Given the persistence of the problem of\r\nSomalia, which today seems more than ever likely to take\r\nanother tragic turn, it would appear that the time has\r\ncome to re-examine that initiative.\r\nIn Rwanda, a human tragedy on a virtually\r\nunprecedented scale took place following the events of\r\nlast April. In this connection, I should like to note that\r\nour country has been actively involved in the search for\r\na solution to this conflict since 1992. Indeed, President\r\nAbdou Diouf, then the Chairman of the OAU, presided\r\nover the lengthy negotiations that culminated in the\r\nArusha Agreements. In addition, officers from the\r\nSenegalese national army were part of the Group of\r\nNeutral Military Observers of the OAU entrusted with\r\nsupervising the cease-fire, a group that was as we know\r\nreplaced in 1993, with the signature of the Arusha\r\nAgreements, by the United Nations Assistance Mission\r\nfor Rwanda (UNAMIR), in which Senegal has\r\nparticipated and continues to participate.\r\nThus, it was quite natural that on 22 June of this\r\nyear, faced with the inadmissible continuing massacre of\r\ncivilians, the Security Council adopted resolution 929\r\n(1994), which established a multinational force for\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nhumanitarian purposes, and that Senegal decided to\r\nparticipate in it.\r\nWith regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, need we\r\nrecall that this is a United Nations Member State to whose\r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty the international\r\ncommunity is committed. This places full responsibility on\r\nthe community of nations, gathered together here, to settle\r\nthe conflict after identifying the aggressor.\r\nHowever, it is as though the Bosnian Serbs had been\r\nactually authorized to defy with impunity and in an ongoing\r\nfashion the expressed will of the international community.\r\nThe attacks against the personnel of the United Nations\r\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR), the repeated violations of\r\nsecurity zones, the rejection of the latest peace plan\r\nproposed by the Contact Group of five Western countries,\r\nare all part of a pattern of confrontation with which the\r\ninternational community must finally deal, firmly and with\r\ndetermination.\r\nIn this connection, we believe that the adoption on 23\r\nSeptember 1994 of Security Council resolution 943 (1994),\r\nwhich suspended the economic sanctions against the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), is not\r\nonly premature but untimely, given the deterioration in the\r\nsituation.\r\nIt is our opinion, one shared by the majority of States\r\nhere present, that the sanctions should be, if not\r\nstrengthened, at least maintained until favourable conditions\r\nhave been created - that is, the establishment of an effective\r\nsystem of international monitoring of the border between\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, on the one hand, and the territories\r\noccupied by the Bosnian Serbs, on the other; the lifting of\r\nthe siege of Sarajevo; the sincere commitment by the\r\nBosnian Serbs to cooperate in reaching a comprehensive\r\npolitical settlement of the crisis; the lifting, where the\r\nBosnian Government is concerned, of the arms embargo\r\nimposed by Security Council resolution 713 (1991) in order\r\nto restore to Bosnia and Herzegovina the means for its self-\r\ndefence as set forth in Article 51 of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nIt is also important that the international community\r\ndedicate itself to the reconstruction of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, a country that is today being battered and\r\ndevastated by blatant aggression.\r\nIn our view, those measures represent the minimum\r\nwe should expect from the international community in order\r\nto give credibility to the peace process being pursued in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. On this delicate issue, Senegal,\r\nwhose Head of State is also the current President of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, will continue to\r\nact within the framework of international law to ensure\r\nthat the Bosnian people, finally reconciled among\r\nthemselves, may know lasting peace based on an equality\r\nof rights and duties among its various components.\r\nThe economic problems today are of such a\r\nmagnitude that a new concept of world security has been\r\ngenerated. Today, indeed, the feeling of insecurity\r\nemanates more often from the vicissitudes of daily life\r\nthan from any fear of global cataclysm. That is the\r\nconclusion reached in this year’s report by the United\r\nNations Development Programme on human development.\r\nJob security, health security and environmental\r\nsecurity are the forms that the global problem of security\r\ntakes today. This development naturally raises the\r\nquestion of the definition of a new \"social pact\", which\r\nmust give further priority to human solidarity - solidarity\r\namong the communities of men - and it demonstrates the\r\ngreat importance that Senegal attaches to the Summit on\r\nsocial development that is to be held in Copenhagen next\r\nMarch. On that occasion we shall have to restructure our\r\nthinking about development, and it will be necessary to\r\nhighlight better the human aspect of development based\r\non greater international solidarity.\r\nIt was in this spirit that, here on 30 September 1992,\r\nSenegal’s Head of State proposed to the international\r\ncommunity the conclusion of a general agreement on\r\nsolidarity - a gentlemen’s agreement on solidarity. It is\r\na positive thing that this proposal has been largely taken\r\non board in the United Nations Secretary-General’s\r\noutline, Agenda for Development, which is designed to\r\npromote a genuine culture of development that will take\r\ninto account all aspects of the human condition.\r\nFor the same reasons Senegal welcomes warmly the\r\nreforms of United Nations bodies that are under way - in\r\nparticular, those bodies that are responsible for questions\r\nof economic and social development.\r\nWe favour the formula \"Trade, not aid\", which has\r\noften been used to indicate that global trade is the\r\ngenuine driving force for economic progress - more so\r\nthan aid for development. It is beneficial that, along\r\nthese lines, on 15 April last, in Marrakesh in the\r\nKingdom of Morocco, the representatives of 126 countries\r\nsigned the agreement that created the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO).\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nWe hope that the birth of the WTO represents the\r\ncompletion of the structure that was conceived half a\r\ncentury ago in Bretton Woods as international trade has\r\nbeen raised to the same status as monetary policy and\r\nfinance for development. Thus, the Marrakesh Final Act\r\nopens the way for a new dynamic of concerted action, of\r\nconsultation and solidarity, that will finally allow for the\r\npromotion of a more just and more balanced system\r\ndesigned to govern international trade.\r\nIf it is to do so, its practical application will have to\r\ninvolve integration of the specific needs and specific\r\nproblems of the group of developing countries - such as\r\ngreater justice in the definition and application of new\r\nmachinery designed to govern international trade; regional\r\neconomic integration; immigration policies; professional\r\ntraining; job creation; and the transfer of technologies to\r\nmeet the needs and aspirations of the countries of the\r\nSouth.\r\nIn this regard, I must mention an event of great\r\nimportance: the adoption, in Paris on 18 June 1994, of the\r\nInternational Convention to Combat Desertification in\r\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa. Many of us here\r\nrepresent those countries.\r\nThis is the outcome, in terms of action, of one of the\r\nmajor recommendations to emerge from the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development. As an\r\ninitiator of the Convention, our continent - Africa - cannot\r\nbut welcome the conclusion of this multilateral legal\r\ninstrument, which recognizes the existence of such a\r\nworrying environmental problem.\r\nIt is desirable that there should be available to this\r\nConvention, as to others of the same type, sufficient\r\nfinancial resources to enable it to halt and reverse the\r\nprocess of desertification, which is a real scourge for the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\nThe changes of considerable scope that have taken\r\nplace on the world stage over the past few years confront\r\nthe United Nations with new challenges and new missions.\r\nFor example, how can the Organization deal with identity\r\nclaims, domestic difficulties and civil wars while respecting\r\nthe principle of the sovereignty of States, which is the\r\ncornerstone of the San Francisco Charter?\r\nIn what way can it - must it - react when individuals\r\nand groups perpetrate all types of serious violations of\r\nfundamental human rights, as happens in the case of the\r\nconflicts that prevail in the former Yugoslavia, Angola,\r\nSomalia and Rwanda? What barriers can be erected\r\nagainst terrorism and civil war in order to cope with the\r\nfragmentation of State entities, which are factors for\r\npeace? In these difficult areas, as in others, our\r\nOrganization will have to demonstrate its ability to\r\nengage in innovation and adaptation.\r\nThe establishment of an international Tribunal to\r\ndeal with war crimes in the former Yugoslavia; the plan\r\nto set up an international criminal court; the deliberation,\r\nbegun last year, on reform of the Security Council and on\r\nbetter implementation of Chapter VIII of the Charter -\r\nthese all demonstrate that the United Nations has\r\ncommitted itself firmly to that course.\r\nAs regards the Security Council in particular, the\r\nreform that is envisaged should be carried out with\r\nconcern simultaneously for efficiency in the functioning\r\nof this body and for real representativeness in keeping\r\nwith the new realities of the world.\r\nThe changes that have taken place in the world\r\nduring the last few years have as their essence the\r\nfundamental aspiration of peoples to freedom, justice and\r\ndevelopment in a spirit of human solidarity. If it is to\r\nlast, the wind of democratization that they have created at\r\nthe national level requires parallel action at the\r\ninternational level. Indeed, we must all ensure the equal\r\nparticipation of all States in the establishment of new\r\nnorms that can give international life a more solid\r\nfoundation and provide better security for all. Such\r\nsecurity can be founded only on shared confidence in the\r\nprinciples that govern our collective contribution to a\r\nbetter future for the world - to the salvation of mankind.\r\nTherefore, on the eve of the celebration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of our Organization, let us, hand in\r\nhand in a spirit of friendship and solidarity, behave in\r\nsuch a way that the new era will shine with the radiance\r\nof justice, peace and solidarity so that we may bequeath\r\nto future generations a world of peace, justice and\r\nfriendship.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of\r\nNew Zealand, His Excellency Mr. Donald Charles\r\nMcKinnon.\r\nMr. McKinnon (New Zealand): I should like, first,\r\nto congratulate Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire on his\r\nwell-deserved election as President of the General\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session and to convey to him\r\nour good wishes for every success in his work.\r\nThe general debate is our chance, as Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, to undertake together an annual review of\r\nthe Organization’s work - its successes and its failures -\r\nand to identify collectively the issues we want to focus on.\r\nWith the fiftieth anniversary next year, there is a pressing\r\nneed to do so. That will be the occasion to chart our new\r\npriorities for the twenty-first century.\r\nOur responses to some of today’s challenges and\r\ntragedies have ranged from excellent but often\r\nunder-reported to woefully inadequate and, consequently,\r\ndefiantly reported.\r\nThe peoples of the world want to believe in the United\r\nNations and what it should achieve. If, however, within\r\nsome parts of the Organization we are bereft of purpose\r\nand intentions this golden anniversary threatens to be less\r\njoyous and more muted than many of us anticipated.\r\nPrince Sisowath Sirirath (Cambodia), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nNew Zealand has a strong vested interest in the United\r\nNations success, as do most small States. The New\r\nZealand people have always believed in the United Nations,\r\nin a collective approach to the resolution of global and\r\nregional problems. This has been demonstrated by strong\r\nsupport for the United Nations by successive Governments.\r\nFrom our experience of - and I do not hesitate to say\r\nthis - a turbulent two years on the Security Council and as\r\na committed founder Member of the Organization, I would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to offer some observations\r\nabout the problems we see as players in the collective\r\ndecision-making process.\r\nWhen New Zealand took part in the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations we and many others saw our primary\r\npurpose as providing for a system of collective security.\r\nUntil very recently that was little more than a vision. With\r\nthe end of the confrontation between two super-Power\r\nblocs, the goal of \"the organized common peace\", of which\r\nPresident Woodrow Wilson spoke so eloquently three\r\ngenerations ago, presents itself. We must not let it slip\r\nfrom our grasp this time. It will, however, take real effort\r\nand real determination.\r\nCollective security, or working together, is the\r\ncornerstone of the security of small States. Today they are\r\nthe overwhelming majority of the membership of this\r\nOrganization. New Zealanders recognize that peace is\r\nindivisible, that remoteness is certainly no safeguard: a\r\nproblem in any part of the world can ripple to the Earth’s\r\nfarthest corners. While we are the country probably most\r\ndistant from the Balkans conflict, we have sent an\r\nenhanced company of soldiers to help in efforts to ease\r\nsuffering and, I earnestly hope with the will of the parties\r\ninvolved, one day bring peace throughout the former\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nFor the same reasons, our defence personnel can be\r\nfound engaged in peace-support operations in Africa, the\r\nMiddle East, Asia and most recently Haiti. And there are\r\nNew Zealand nurses, firefighters and aid workers spread\r\naround the globe in support.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, however, New Zealanders are\r\npuzzled at times by the way in which the United Nations\r\ncarries out some of its important tasks. In Bosnia, despite\r\nthe employment of what is by any standards a large, well-\r\narmed and well-trained force, people see on their\r\ntelevision screens nightly the frustration of the United\r\nNations Protection Force by small groups of irregulars, a\r\nsingle policeman or even small groups of non-combatants.\r\nIn Haiti they witnessed a boat full of Blue Berets turned\r\naway by a small group of pistol-toting thugs\r\nunconvincingly called \"attachés\".\r\nAnd what can one say about the appalling tragedy in\r\nRwanda? How can so much hatred have been unleashed\r\nso viciously, killing hundreds of thousands? What we\r\nwatched with horror on our television screens was\r\ndestruction on a scale we thought only megaton bombs\r\nwere capable of. The systematic slaughter of men,\r\nwomen and children simply because of their ethnic origin\r\nleaves us all outraged.\r\nThere are no easy answers. But the first key to\r\nunlocking the possibilities for a genuine collective\r\nsecurity must be the proper application of the United\r\nNations Charter. We have to decide at exactly what point\r\nthe United Nations should get involved in the\r\npeacemaking operation. Do we recognize a problem, and,\r\nif we do, is the preventive diplomacy that we so firmly\r\nbelieve in occurring?\r\nIn my view, we have to follow the intention of the\r\nCharter. First, at the outset of a crisis, or even the signs\r\nof a crisis, we have to make more serious efforts through\r\nthat preventive diplomacy to resolve problems and\r\nconflicts by negotiation. Efforts must be made at an early\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nstage to address the root causes of conflicts by the Security\r\nCouncil’s exercising all its responsibilities under Chapter VI\r\nof the Charter.\r\nHowever, on some occasions, in these days of modern\r\nmedia technology, we face the dilemma caused by the\r\ndivergence between what the public perceives as happening\r\nand what is the reality. Extensive media coverage puts\r\npressure on for immediate response. In the case of\r\nRwanda, that was appropriate. In other circumstances, the\r\nmedia oversimplify and ignore the fact that conditions on\r\nthe ground are chaotic and United Nations resources are\r\nover-stretched.\r\nA second area where the Charter could be more\r\ncarefully applied is when disputes are first placed before\r\nthe Council. I believe it should give affected States an\r\nadequate hearing before addressing the problem behind\r\nclosed doors. Our experience on the Security Council\r\nsuggests the investment in openness that would be achieved\r\nby developing a practice of collectively hearing directly\r\nfrom the parties involved would be worthwhile, even if it\r\nwere done only informally.\r\nIn the same vein, the Charter specifically contemplates\r\nthe involvement, without vote, of troop-contributing\r\ncountries in significant decisions. New Zealand has pressed\r\nthis issue for some time, but so far with limited success.\r\nThe time is coming, in fact, when the General Assembly\r\nwill have to address the question if the Security Council\r\ndoes not respond adequately to the concerns that have been\r\nraised.\r\nUnder the Charter, much is expected of the Council’s\r\npermanent members. There is no doubt that they can and\r\ndo contribute greatly to the work of the United Nations.\r\nLeadership and sacrifices by the large Powers were, for\r\nexample, instrumental in successfully challenging\r\naggression against the small State of Kuwait three-and-a-\r\nhalf years ago.\r\nI emphasize again, however, the importance of the\r\ncollective nature of decision-making in the Security\r\nCouncil. Making distinctions between the views of the\r\n\"P5\" and the rest is not really healthy. The Council is a\r\nteam of 15. It must work together, and by that I mean\r\ngiving full weight to the views of all its members. The\r\nstrength of the Security Council is enhanced each year by\r\nthe vigorous enthusiasm brought by new members on 1\r\nJanuary, testing what may have become an accepted\r\nsecond-best.\r\nI would remind the Assembly that the Charter\r\nclearly envisages that the norm for operations to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security will be United Nations\r\noperations. National operations are not ruled out, of\r\ncourse. I wish therefore to highlight and question recent\r\ntrends toward coalitions under national command, and the\r\nimplications for the collective security needs of small and\r\ndistant countries where no strategic interest is involved.\r\nHowever, the Security Council will be judged on its\r\neffectiveness. Successes, hopefully, will outweigh\r\nfailures, but we all have an obligation to improve the\r\nsuccess rate. I am an enthusiastic supporter of improving\r\nour success rate, but much of that will come down to the\r\nway in which issues are managed. And it is that question\r\nof the management of issues that I wish to address.\r\nIn our experience, the key is to use management\r\ntools based on proven modern public- and private-sector\r\nexperience. This is very valuable. What are these tools?\r\nAnd how do we apply them to the conduct of peace-\r\nkeeping operations?\r\nI would suggest that there are six critical elements:\r\nfirst, a sustainable financial system; secondly, a\r\ntransparent political accountability; thirdly, clear\r\nobjectives that incorporate regular reviews; fourthly, a\r\nclear, unambiguous command and control structure;\r\nfifthly, a credible legal regime that guarantees the security\r\nof United Nations personnel; and, sixthly, the availability\r\nof resources so that objectives can be met quickly and\r\nefficiently.\r\nLet me go back to that first point, a sustainable\r\nfinancial system. There is no doubt that the Organization\r\nis facing a financial crisis that cannot be ignored. We\r\nhave had serious problems with reserves and we have\r\nsignificant debt to contributing countries. The largest\r\ncontributor has indicated that it will unilaterally reduce its\r\nshare of funding from October next year. The situation\r\nis not sustainable. It requires urgent action.\r\nWhy do we have this crisis? There are some simple\r\nanswers. Some members cannot pay; others will not pay;\r\nand some are arguing the legitimacy of their assessment.\r\nThe General Assembly, this body, must confront this\r\nissue. The United Nations must stop extending credit to\r\nnon-payers. There is enough evidence emerging to\r\nsuggest that there may be serious inequities in the present\r\nsystem.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nSome countries with extraordinarily strong growth\r\nover the past 5 to 10 years appear in the revised scale\r\nissued by the Committee on Contributions with a constant\r\nor even reduced contribution level. That is not acceptable.\r\nIt must be remedied.\r\nWe do not want a hollow celebration on the fiftieth\r\nanniversary with a cash crisis hanging over the\r\nOrganization. We must make a commitment to resolve this\r\ncrisis before the conclusion of the forty-ninth session.\r\nThe next point is the need for political accountability.\r\nThere is in my view a parallel priority to develop and\r\nimprove the Organization’s capacity for undertaking its\r\ncollective security responsibilities. To do that we need to\r\nput in place more transparent procedures throughout the\r\nOrganization. The management of peace-keeping\r\noperations is allocated to the Secretariat. This is necessary\r\nand appropriate in the same way any Government delegates\r\nresponsibility for a complex operation to its public service.\r\nHowever, and I speak as a politician and as a Minister\r\nresponsible for the management and oversight of\r\nGovernment departments, the days are long gone when a\r\npublic service mandarin could run a department or major\r\noperation without detailed political oversight. This is not\r\na promotion of micro-management, nor am I implying any\r\ncriticism of the Secretariat staff. But as any politician\r\nholding executive office in today’s democracies knows, the\r\nclassic recipe for a failed project is for those who are\r\npolitically accountable to lose track of implementation or to\r\nlose the game plan.\r\nWe saw that all too clearly in the past year in\r\nSomalia. Ironically, the Security Council had, in resolution\r\n814 (1993), already foreseen the need in the case of the\r\nUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) for a\r\ndetailed political accountability and provided for a\r\ncommittee to follow the operation closely. But the\r\ncommittee was never established.\r\nNew Zealand has proposed in the Security Council\r\nthat a committee or an ad hoc working group should be\r\nestablished to fill this gap and enhance the accountability of\r\nthe Organization to its politically responsible\r\nrepresentatives. I certainly remain hopeful that progress\r\ncan be made in this area.\r\nThe third point I draw to the attention of members is\r\nthe need for clear objectives with regular reviews. Clearer\r\nmission objectives must be developed and kept under\r\nreview. I am delighted that some progress has in fact been\r\nmade. The Council is now identifying more closely the\r\nterms of mandates for United Nations operations, and it\r\nis becoming usual to build a specific review cycle into its\r\nmandates. But there are still two areas of weakness.\r\nFirst, there is a great deal of mythology about and\r\nvery little sound analysis of the circumstances in which\r\nforce should be used by United Nations operations. Many\r\nbelieve this is governed by the use or non-use of the\r\nwords \"Chapter VII\". This could well be a false\r\nconclusion. The rules of engagement rather than abstract\r\nreference to the Charter are much more likely to\r\ndetermine actual behaviour in the field.\r\nI am not alone in believing that there is a need to\r\ndevelop greater commonality in military doctrine for\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations. This is\r\nespecially relevant when so many peace-keeping\r\ncontributors are regularly placed side by side in the field.\r\nIt is, however, particularly urgent in the face of new-style\r\noperations of the intra-country type where the use of force\r\nby factions, not necessarily Governments, is the challenge\r\nfor this body to overcome.\r\nIt is clear that common principles are necessary to\r\nguide peace-keepers on the appropriate use of force when\r\nthey take part in operations in pursuit of an agreed United\r\nNations strategic objective. As for the review, while\r\nthere are plenty of mid-term reviews there is, as yet, no\r\nsystematic process of review at the end of an operation.\r\nThe budget of every peace-keeping operation should\r\ninclude provision, as a principal line item, for the\r\npreparation of a comprehensive review of the operation’s\r\nachievements relative to the mandate set.\r\nSuch reviews should be separate from the financial\r\nperformance review and should address the substance of\r\nthe operation and seek to identify all relevant lessons for\r\nthe conduct of future operations.\r\nI address now the question of command and control.\r\nThere is a weakness in the command and control\r\nstructures and they do need attention. It is true the\r\npersonnel of national defence forces which contribute\r\nforces to the United Nations legally remain in their\r\ncountry’s national service. But as I see it, parallel to the\r\nallocation of responsibility to the United Nations Force\r\nCommander must be a recognition that the national\r\ncommand structure will not seek to direct their forces in\r\noperational matters. If the national command authority\r\nhas serious difficulties, then the appropriate course of\r\naction in all cases - except an emergency - is for the issue\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nto be resolved with United Nations Headquarters. If\r\nresolution is not possible the unit should be withdrawn.\r\nI come to the question of the safety of peace-keeping\r\npersonnel. A major requirement for effective collective\r\nsecurity is that countries contributing troops and civilian\r\npersonnel should have confidence that their personnel in the\r\nfield will have the best possible support to ensure their\r\nsafety and security. That is an issue which, as many\r\nmembers know, New Zealand has pursued relentlessly\r\nduring its time on the Council. It bears on the level of\r\nequipment with which the forces are outfitted and there is\r\nplenty of room for improvement.\r\nIn addition, the legal regime under which peace-\r\nkeeping operations are conducted needs to reflect the\r\nextraordinary personal risk which United Nations personnel\r\nare undertaking on behalf of us all in carrying out collective\r\nsecurity operations. It is right that such personnel should\r\nbe differentiated from soldiers in an armed conflict and that\r\nthere should be a higher standard of legal responsibility for\r\nanybody who attacks them. I urge all members of the\r\nAssembly to support New Zealand’s initiative on this issue\r\ncurrently in the Sixth Committee, that the necessary\r\nflexibility be shown on outstanding issues and that we make\r\na really determined effort to complete work on the draft\r\nconvention this year.\r\nThe question of resources is always before us. In my\r\nsixth point I would say that a critical tool for effective\r\ncollective security is a strategy for resource availability.\r\nThe situation we all saw recently in Rwanda is a classic\r\ncase. Human resources were available but they lacked\r\ntraining and they lacked equipment. But there is also the\r\nneed for a capacity in all peace-keeping operations for a\r\nforceful response in self-defence. There are important\r\nlessons to be learned from the troop losses in Rwanda last\r\nApril and again I draw attention to the linkage between\r\nmandates, rules of engagement, doctrine and planning.\r\nThe United Nations will have to go beyond the current\r\nwork being done on stand-by forces to address this\r\nproblem.\r\nWe believe that there is a case for redirecting a\r\nsubstantial portion of bilateral military assistance into forms\r\nof training that would better assist defence forces with the\r\nrequirements of peace-keeping operations.\r\nThere is also a role for the United Nations maintaining\r\nthe physical equivalent of the peace-keeping reserve fund\r\nthat it is supposed to have on the financial side now. A\r\nquick start-up capability, with owned or leased equipment\r\nimmediately available to the United Nations, would have\r\nmade a significant difference in the Rwanda situation.\r\nThis is a practical and feasible step that can be taken to\r\nensure that future collective security can in fact rise to the\r\nchallenge.\r\nI have spoken about the factors that need to be taken\r\ninto account in managing peace-keeping operations. I\r\nnow wish to address the terms of their engagements.\r\nThe United Nations should not be expected to take\r\nresponsibility for a situation of up to 30 years because the\r\nparties to a conflict are unable or unwilling to summon up\r\nthe necessary political will to reach a settlement. There\r\ncomes a point when the parties must take their fate in\r\ntheir own hands rather than the Council avoiding the hard\r\ndecisions just by rolling over the mandates.\r\nAt the same time, a range of different considerations\r\nshould prevail when the United Nations reaches the end\r\nof a successful peace-keeping process. The United\r\nNations cannot simply walk away when a perceived end\r\npoint - such as an election - has been achieved, because\r\nthere may still be outstanding issues that need the\r\nongoing support of the operation, such as humanitarian\r\noperations or local capability-building programmes to help\r\nprovide the required sound administration.\r\nThe United Nations deserves congratulations on its\r\nachievements in Cambodia, for example, but the future\r\nthere is still not certain, and the United Nations must\r\nmaintain its responsibilities. Rehabilitation in that country\r\nmust continue.\r\nAnother example of a situation in which\r\npeacemaking and peace-building have to be seen as a\r\ncoherent whole is in the area of demining. This is a\r\ncritically important humanitarian function. New\r\nZealand’s military forces have had a lot of experience in\r\nhelping the United Nations with demining in Afghanistan,\r\nCambodia and, most recently, Mozambique.\r\nThe Security Council Mission that visited\r\nMozambique about two months ago reported its dismay\r\nat the delays and at the state of the programme generally.\r\nAt the request of the United Nations, New Zealand\r\nstepped in early in August and began the rescue effort for\r\nthe programme. The wheel should not have had to be\r\nreinvented. It is a concern that lessons learned from\r\nearlier operations such as Afghanistan and Cambodia do\r\nnot appear to be retained. Having seen firsthand the\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\neffects of mines in Cambodia, I do believe we should move\r\nmore expeditiously than the speed of the present\r\nperformance.\r\nNew Zealand certainly looks forward to working with\r\nother delegations to improve performance in this area, and\r\nI would certainly add that my Government was most\r\ninterested in the comments President Clinton made here\r\nyesterday about the proposal for the elimination of the\r\nworld’s 85 million anti-personnel land-mines. This is an\r\nurgent task. No one who has seen firsthand the human cost\r\nof mines can offer anything less than full cooperation to\r\nthis end.\r\nFinally, when we look ahead to what would really\r\nenhance proper use of the collective security powers, we\r\nhave to conclude that reform of the Security Council is a\r\nmajor task waiting to be fulfilled. Many of the things I\r\nhave discussed today require reforms by the Security\r\nCouncil, or at least in conjunction with it. But I cannot\r\nescape the conclusion that even if all of these were\r\naccomplished, the political legitimacy of the Security\r\nCouncil could still erode over a period of time. Ultimately\r\nit could lose the credibility vital to the role it carries out.\r\nCollective security requires the Council to be\r\ngenuinely representative of the entire United Nations\r\nmembership. We have, of course, as many others have\r\ndone, followed the debate on Security Council reform in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group set up last year. We hear the\r\ncase made for additional permanent members. We also\r\nhear overwhelming support for expanding the number of\r\nnon-permanent members of the Council. There are shades\r\nof difference on the numbers for the total membership, but\r\nconsensus does seem to be emerging around five or six new\r\nmembers. We consider that a limited expansion of the\r\nnumber of members, paying regard to an equitable\r\ngeographical participation, is still a priority for the health\r\nof the Organization. It is time to do what is achievable and\r\nwhat benefits most Members. Given the need for 122\r\nratifications, we are aware that even a simple expansion,\r\nhopefully adopted next year, will take several years to come\r\ninto force. It would not be unrealistic, therefore, for the\r\nyear 2000 to see the first meeting of the expanded Council.\r\nThere is no worth in being critical of some aspects of\r\nthe United Nations without believing, as I do, that the\r\nproblems can be cured. We, all 184 of us, are its doctors,\r\nand we need to act quickly. We need to apportion our\r\ncosts fairly and systematically. We need to share peace-\r\nkeeping tasks, peace-keeping funding and peace-keeping\r\nsupplies. We need to accept the democratic decisions of\r\nthis Organization. We also need to adjust to the more\r\ncomplex and interrelated United Nations agendas of the\r\nfuture.\r\nI therefore leave with the Assembly New Zealand’s\r\nassurance of a renewed commitment to this unique and\r\nessential body and of our willingness to work in that\r\nspirit to ensure the continued relevance of the United\r\nNations for the next half-century.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, His Excellency Mr.\r\nMohamed Salem Ould Lekhal.\r\nMr. Ould Lekhal (Mauritania) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): First of all, I should like to extend to you, Sir,\r\non behalf of my delegation, my warmest congratulations\r\non your well-deserved election to the presidency of the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are convinced that your outstanding skills and\r\nyour vast experience will guarantee the success of this\r\nsession. Your country, the sister republic of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, has always played an effective and moderating\r\nrole in the search for peace in Africa and throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nI should like also to express my most sincere\r\ncongratulations to your predecessor, Ambassador Samuel\r\nInsanally of Guyana, for the competence and skill with\r\nwhich he led the work of the previous session.\r\nI should like also to express, on behalf of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania, our admiration of and\r\nsupport for the unremitting efforts of Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\naimed at enabling our Organization to achieve its goals.\r\nOur current session takes place at a time when the\r\ninternational community is faced with numerous\r\nchallenges. These include a constant deterioration in the\r\nterms of trade, the growing disparity between rich and\r\npoor countries, and an increase in hotbeds of tension. In\r\naddition, many people in the poor countries are being\r\ncrushed under a debt burden that is constantly getting\r\nheavier, with, as a consequence, gloomy prospects for the\r\nsocio-economic development of the peoples of those\r\ncountries.\r\nInstead of the hoped-for prosperity, what we are\r\nwitnessing today are bloody conflicts which are ravaging\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nentire countries with all their attendant miseries and forms\r\nof destruction. Such nefarious developments not only\r\nundermine all the hard-won achievements of the people of\r\nthose countries, but also afflict them with new types of\r\nsuffering and make them lose any hope they may have had\r\nin enjoying a life of dignity, stability and progress.\r\nThe international economic situation continues to be\r\ncause for concern for a large number of developing\r\ncountries that feel the negative impacts of structural\r\nadjustment programmes, which focus on macroeconomic\r\nequilibriums and display a marked degree of such\r\nindifference to the social cost of such adjustments.\r\nIt should be emphasized that of the 55 countries which\r\nhave implemented those programmes during the 1980-1989\r\nperiod, only 7 have been able to improve their economic\r\nsituation. During that same decade, a downward trend in\r\nper capita income was noted in 29 countries, while in 13\r\nother countries there has been a real deterioration of social\r\nconditions.\r\nThese crisis elements have been compounded by\r\nstagnation and the reduction in public development\r\nassistance, despite the fact that the .7 per cent objective was\r\nsupposed to contribute to the creation of better conditions.\r\nIt is regrettable to note that the deterioration in the\r\neconomic situation is of such a nature that it may well have\r\na negative effect on the implementation of international\r\nconventions and programmes, notably those which relate to\r\nthe environment, the programme of action for children, and\r\nthe programme of action for the advancement and\r\nprotection of human rights. Furthermore such deterioration\r\nwill have an adverse effect on the chances for the success\r\nof other ongoing negotiations which aim at finding\r\nsolutions to problems that threaten the prosperity of\r\nhumankind as a whole.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the negative effects of the\r\neconomic crisis are too numerous to enumerate and\r\nunfortunately, it is the most vulnerable sectors of society,\r\nsuch as women, children and the poor that bear the full\r\nbrunt of the situation. If in our time unemployment and a\r\nhigh crime rate are widespread phenomena, countries with\r\nlimited resources are apt to be more exposed to their effects\r\nthan others. The need to devise a preventive approach\r\nwhich would make it possible to face up to these social ills\r\nis thus becoming all the more urgent.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the forthcoming World\r\nSummit for Social Development, in Copenhagen, and hope\r\nthe summit will result in initiatives that will enable\r\ndeveloping countries to make significant advances in their\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt has become quite clear that development is the\r\nreal guarantor of world peace and that the miserable\r\nliving conditions of the overwhelming majority of the\r\ninhabitants of our planet make it impossible to achieve\r\npeace and stability in our world.\r\nThus we place a great deal of hope in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposed Agenda for Development. Such a\r\ndocument would deserve our appreciation and should\r\nobtain widespread support in order for it to become a true\r\ntool in promoting economic and social development\r\neverywhere.\r\nThe fragility of the world economic situation should\r\nnot obscure the successes achieved in several areas of\r\ninternational relations.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the success of the\r\nSecretary-General’s consultations which aimed at\r\nresolving the problems posed to certain countries by\r\nChapter XI of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, whose coming into force as of 16\r\nNovember 1994, will mark the beginning of a decisive\r\nphase in its evolution.\r\nOur country considers that the United Nations\r\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks should lead to strict and global\r\nresolutions that would put an end to the plundering of\r\nfishing resources as well as to the anarchy that currently\r\nprevails in the seas.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania has, along with\r\ncountries threatened by the phenomenon of desertification,\r\nmade major efforts to conclude a world convention to\r\nfight drought and desertification, especially in Africa.\r\nWhile we welcome the positive outcome of those\r\nnegotiations, we do express the hope that the convention\r\nwill be the start of positive action on the part of the\r\ninternational community in favour of those countries\r\nwhich have suffered the most.\r\nAll the results achieved thanks to the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations highlight the focal and vital role with\r\nwhich our Organization is entrusted and attest to its\r\nuniversality.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nThere is no doubt, however, that a reform of the\r\nstructures and procedures of the Organization is now\r\nnecessary. The decisions already taken to revitalize the\r\nEconomic and Social Council will be no more than a dead\r\nletter so long as they are not accompanied by the allocation\r\nof resources that would make it possible to implement the\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\nWe should always bear in mind the fact that all\r\nconflicts and all the resultant peace-keeping operations,\r\nwhich mobilize such vast financial resources, have as their\r\nmain cause the deterioration of the economic and social\r\nconditions of the countries concerned.\r\nA rapid overview of our globe and the areas of tension\r\nis enough to prove that underdevelopment and the problems\r\nit causes only fuel such tensions.\r\nAdvances in the area of democracy and human rights\r\nare, to be sure, the most important achievements the\r\ninternational community has seen in recent times.\r\nWhile we commend the progress achieved in these two\r\nareas, we must not lose sight of the fact that democracy\r\ncannot be confined to the national frameworks of individual\r\nStates, but should embrace also international relations\r\namong nations.\r\nThis is the reason why we support efforts to expand\r\nrepresentation within the Security Council by increasing its\r\nmembership. We hope that such reform will take place in\r\nline with the tenets of democratic transparency.\r\nWhatever the final formula adopted for the new\r\nconfiguration of the Security Council might be, we believe\r\nit will be necessary to respect the principle of the co-\r\nequality of Member States, and the fact that, according to\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter, the Security Council acts on\r\nbehalf of those Member States, and must, therefore, reflect\r\nthe views and aspirations of the international community in\r\nits entirety.\r\nThe democratic process which was launched in 1986\r\nin the Islamic Republic of Mauritania through the\r\nestablishment of democratic institutions and the\r\norganization of presidential and parliamentary elections in\r\n1992, has been consolidated further with the organization\r\nof elections for municipal councils and for one third of the\r\nsenate seats. Those elections, which have elicited extensive\r\nparticipation on the part of voters, have been covered\r\nextensively by the independent national press, following\r\nelectoral campaigns by several political parties which\r\nrepresent various trends of opinion.\r\nThus the Mauritanian people are daily consolidating\r\nthe foundations of their young democracy, which in the\r\nwords of the President of the Republic, His Excellency\r\nMr. Maaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed Taya, is the mainspring\r\n\"of all sovereignty and legality\".\r\nIt is in this democratic environment that the\r\nMauritanian people are waging a determined struggle\r\nagainst various aspects of economic and social\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nWe should highlight the important gains made by\r\nour country through the implementation, in 1984, of a\r\nseries of economic reforms, as well as the political\r\nstability, freedom, justice and equality now enjoyed by all\r\nMauritanian citizens.\r\nWe should also voice the pride of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Mauritania at being one of the few\r\ndeveloping countries where there have been no political\r\nprisoners, and where freedom of the press, a multi-party\r\nsystem, and freedom of trade unions have become\r\nrealities similar to those which States that value the rule\r\nof law, such as the countries with longstanding\r\ndemocratic traditions, pride themselves on.\r\nThe quest for peace will continue to be our main\r\nconcern so that we may rise to the challenges of the end\r\nof this century. The end of the cold war has opened up\r\nnew vistas for the emergence of a better world where\r\njustice and peace may prevail. Yet the increasing number\r\nof hotbeds of tension which require the organization of\r\npeace-keeping operations leads us to believe that a new\r\nstyle of diplomacy is becoming a must if we are to\r\nprevent the recurrence of human tragedies similar to those\r\nwhich were witnessed in the past or those which we now\r\nexperience and are unable to stop or to resolve.\r\nOur country hopes that the recent developments\r\nwhich have been taking place in the Middle East will\r\nconstitute the beginnings of a solution to the tragedy of\r\nthe Palestinian people and that, at last, they will be able\r\nto exercise their legitimate right to establish an\r\nindependent State. We believe that the Declaration of\r\nPrinciples of 13 September 1993, giving autonomy to\r\nGaza - which was followed up by the Cairo agreement of\r\n4 May 1994 and most recently, on 25 July 1994, the\r\nmeeting between His Majesty King Hussein of Jordan and\r\nIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin - will usher in a\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nnew era. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania hopes this\r\ninitial success will lead to a just, comprehensive and lasting\r\npeace based on the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\r\nThe United Nations should continue to support peace\r\nefforts in the Middle East until such time as a final\r\nsettlement of the problems still pending in the region is\r\nreached. In this connection, we hope the commitment\r\nundertaken by donors at their meeting on 1 October 1993\r\nwill be translated into concrete action that would revitalize\r\nthe economy of Palestine and help solve its economic and\r\nsocial problems.\r\nIn that sensitive region, the after-effects of the Gulf\r\nwar continue to make themselves felt. The Islamic\r\nRepublic of Mauritania, which has always affirmed its\r\nunswerving support for international legality, has made\r\nclear its total rejection of any violation of fraternal\r\nKuwait’s independence or territorial integrity or of the\r\nrights of its citizens, just as it stands against anything that\r\nmight undermine Iraq’s unity or territorial integrity. The\r\ntime has come to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi\r\npeople.\r\nIn the same sensitive region, my country wishes to\r\nrenew its unflagging and total support for the recovery by\r\nthe fraternal State of the United Arab Emirates of its\r\nlegitimate rights over the islands of Lesser Tumb, Greater\r\nTumb and Abu Moussa.\r\nWith regard to the Arab Maghreb, we still hope the\r\nUnited Nations will be able to eliminate the obstacles which\r\ncontinue to impede the resolution to the Sahara problem.\r\nMy country will spare no effort in helping the Organization\r\nin the implementation of resolutions relevant to this issue.\r\nOur determination stems from our desire to reach a just and\r\nlasting solution and to strengthen the process of building a\r\nunited Arab Maghreb.\r\nWe also hope the embargo imposed on the Libyan\r\npeople will be lifted. We are aware that the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya has shown tangible proof of its readiness to\r\ncooperate with the United Nations and other groups and\r\nthat the embargo is affecting the interests of all other\r\npeoples in the Maghreb.\r\nWith regard to Africa, I should like to express my\r\ncountry’s satisfaction with the peace-keeping operations\r\napproved by the United Nations with the aim of putting an\r\nend to the bloody confrontations in parts of that continent.\r\nThe Rwandan tragedy, marked by the death of half a\r\nmillion people in the space of a few weeks, is one of the\r\nmost horrible ordeals of our era. In this connection, I\r\nmust commend the excellent organization of Operation\r\nTurquoise, which has been led and meticulously executed\r\nby France within the allotted time-frames. The operation\r\nwas a model of proper and disinterested humanitarian\r\nintervention. My country took part in that noble\r\nhumanitarian action that saved tens of thousands of\r\nhuman lives and provided our Rwandan brethren with an\r\nopportunity to work together to find a solution to their\r\nproblem. We hope such international efforts will enable\r\nthose brethren to heal their wounds and work towards the\r\nestablishment of national unity and the rebuilding of their\r\ncountry.\r\nUnfortunately, Rwanda is not the only place in\r\nAfrica where an armed conflict is causing fratricidal\r\nstrife. In Somalia, Liberia and Angola, civil wars\r\ncontinues to rage, despite the tireless efforts of the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity to restore\r\npeace and concord in place of hatred and war between\r\nbrothers. We hope the citizens of those countries will\r\nheed the voice of reason and will agree to safeguard their\r\ninterests and the right of their peoples to enjoy peace and\r\nsecurity. This objective can be achieved only through\r\nresponsible and constructive dialogue. Experience has\r\nshown that the language of arms cannot lead to valid\r\nsolutions.\r\nIn Mozambique we are following with special\r\ninterest the various steps expected to lead to the holding\r\nof elections on the 27th and 28th of October 1994. We\r\nhope those elections will embody the spirit of the peace\r\nagreement concluded in October 1992 and that they will\r\nbe conducted under proper conditions of peace and\r\nconcord.\r\nThe human tragedies that have beset the African\r\ncontinent should not blind us to the positive events that\r\nhave taken place, such as the triumph of democracy in\r\nSouth Africa under the presidency of Nelson Mandela and\r\nthe settlement of the conflict between Libya and Chad.\r\nWe welcome the representatives of South Africa. Their\r\npresence here among us, representing as it does the\r\nculmination of a decades-long struggle by all African\r\npeoples, is a source of pride and happiness.\r\nOn the European continent, which appears to all as\r\nthe most fertile ground for democracy and respect for\r\nhuman rights, the outright aggression by the Serbs against\r\nthe Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a clear affront\r\nto the human conscience. The efforts of the international\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\ncommunity over two long years have failed to put an end\r\nto the Serbian aggression, which has clearly taken the form\r\nof \"ethnic cleansing\" vis-à-vis the Muslims. No serious\r\nmilitary effort has been made yet to put an end to the\r\nsuffering of the inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nwho continue to suffer under the embargo that denies them\r\nthe arms needed for self-defence. Indeed, it is high time\r\nthe United Nations discharged its full responsibilities under\r\nthe Charter and used all necessary means, including armed\r\nforce, to put an end to that terrible tragedy in line with the\r\nprinciples of the Charter and the Organization’s\r\nresponsibility to maintain peace.\r\nIn 1995 we will be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof our Organization. That commemoration should make it\r\npossible for us to take stock of the progress made over half\r\na century and to devise better plans and programmes to\r\ndeal with future problems. Two other events of major\r\nimportance will take place in the same year and will have\r\nto do with the search for solutions to major problems which\r\nare still pending: the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and the Fourth World Conference on Women\r\nin Beijing. We hope the results of those two meetings will\r\ncoalesce with the outcome of the negotiations which aim at\r\nreforming the Security Council so that the Organization will\r\nbe equipped with the necessary structures that would enable\r\nit to deal with the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nToday more than ever, the peoples of the world are\r\nmaking the United Nations the repository of all their hopes,\r\nand the Organization must ensure the maintenance of peace\r\nand promote cooperation for development at one and the\r\nsame time. By so doing our Organization would crystallize\r\nhumanity’s aspirations to a world of peace and stability and\r\nwould then become a true crucible where all nations joined\r\ntheir efforts to bring forth an era of freedom, democracy\r\nand respect for human rights.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lebanon, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Fares Boueiz.\r\nMr. Boueiz (Lebanon) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nWe are gathered here today, in a new session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in a new year in the life of the United\r\nNations, one that will take us to the end of the first half\r\ncentury of its existence, which we shall celebrate next year.\r\nHalf a century will have passed since the birth of a\r\ngreat dream, a dream that humanity envisaged as an\r\nendeavor for peace, reconciliation, solidarity,\r\nrapprochement, and dialogue amongst peoples of different\r\nethnic origins and cultures across continents, a dialogue\r\namongst nations, States, ideologies, religions, and creeds\r\nof this world, with all its differences and singularities.\r\nThrough this great dream, humanity wanted to create\r\nan arbiter, a referee on right, justice, and peace, and a\r\nforum in which it could discuss its problems and seek\r\narbitration; in which it could find a way to defend rights\r\nwhen rights are denied, to defend itself when injustice\r\nprevails, and a champion that would stand by its side\r\nwhen it is threatened.\r\nThrough this dream, mankind sought to put an end\r\nto wars and armed conflicts, to protect the sovereignty of\r\nnations, and to guarantee respect for their independence\r\nand free choice.\r\nThus, the United Nations came into existence.\r\nThe United Nations was born; and along with it, a\r\ngreat project emerged - one that was expected to\r\ncontribute to the solution of the world’s crises. Alongside\r\nthe Organization, its political, security, social, economic,\r\nand cultural organs were set up. The peoples of the\r\nworld expected a lot from those organs, and treated them\r\naccordingly, with a deference commensurate with their\r\nstanding.\r\nThe will of this prestigious world body, which\r\nrepresents the position, the decision, and the will of the\r\nworld’s peoples, is more comprehensive than the will of\r\nany individual State, no matter how great and powerful it\r\nmay be. The peoples of the world looked up to it and\r\naccorded it the respect normally granted to the defenders\r\nof right and justice. Right and justice supersede political\r\ninterests, no matter how strong they may be.\r\nHow far away are we today from this dream, from\r\nthis great endeavour, from all those intentions, slogans,\r\nambitions, aspirations, ideals and prospects?\r\nWhere is peace in the world, when battlefronts are\r\nwidespread? What have we done about the resolution of\r\nconflicts while conflicts escalate? What about the\r\nelimination of violence which is still on the ascendance?\r\nHow far away are we today from protecting what is right;\r\nfrom upholding the sovereignty of nations which is still\r\nundermined; from respecting human rights and the rights\r\nof peoples and States which are still being trampled?\r\nWhat have we done about the resolutions adopted by\r\nthis very Organization, in this very General Assembly\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nHall? What about the resolutions that await\r\nimplementation, and the many others that await adoption,\r\nand are knocking about in the labyrinths of impotence and\r\ndeals? How far away are we today from the credibility and\r\nauthority of our resolutions, from the one single standard by\r\nwhich we should judge things?\r\nI beg your indulgence for daring to voice these\r\nquestionings. I beg your indulgence, because they are\r\nvoiced by a State which is not privileged to be a member\r\nof the club of powerful nations which dare to question the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI beg your indulgence, because those who need the\r\nUnited Nations are not the powerful and the influential.\r\nThe United Nations was not created for them. It was\r\ncreated for the oppressed, for the unjustly treated, for those\r\nwho are not powerful by any means.\r\nThe small size of States and the humble size of their\r\npopulations have never been the true yardstick by which\r\ntheir role and contribution should be measured. Many\r\nnations have had a history larger than their geography, a\r\nrole larger than their size, and a contribution far greater\r\nthan the potential of others. Lebanon is one of those\r\nStates.\r\nWe have existed for thousands of years, ever since\r\nhumanity first organized itself into entities. We have had\r\nour political, cultural, economic, legal, and humanistic\r\nstructures ever since.\r\nMr. Lopes da Rosa (Guinea-Bissau), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nSide by side with its Phoenician civilization, Lebanon\r\nembraced Pharaonic, Mesopotamian, Persian, Greek,\r\nRoman, Arab, and Western civilizations. Our foremost\r\ncontribution was to give mankind its first alphabet. We\r\nhave also enriched it with our legal, intellectual, cultural,\r\neconomic, scientific, educational and humanistic\r\ncontributions.\r\nWe were present when the United Nations was born.\r\nWe were also present when the International Court of\r\nJustice issued its first opinion, and we contributed to its\r\nmaking. We volunteered to work in all the United Nations\r\norgans and programmes at all levels. We shouldered our\r\nshare of responsibility by hosting some of them, and by\r\noffering them the best of our men and intellectuals.\r\nSocial and cultural pluralism was our national\r\nhallmark. In our composition, we were able to develop\r\nan abridged formula for multicultural nation States. The\r\nprinciple of state-building in the post-First World War era\r\nwas based on nationalities and ethnic origins. But today\r\nin the era of communications super-highways, in the era\r\nof ever-increasing demographic mobility, we have come\r\nto recognize that this principle, when put to the test, has\r\nfailed.\r\nWhile attempts have been made through the years to\r\nobliterate the distinctive identities of peoples living under\r\ncertain regimes - as in the case of the Soviet Union\r\nduring the Stalin era - those identities have resurfaced, as\r\nhave the problems which resulted from the attempt at\r\ntheir suppression.\r\nIf Lebanon were an almost unique case in the past,\r\ngiven the pluralistic features of its society, it is no longer\r\nso today. The Lebanese experience has become\r\ncommonplace, as we have come to witness through the\r\nnow commonplace demographic movement of populations\r\nand the lowering of geopolitical barriers. While our\r\nformula has been tested, many countries are still in the\r\nexperimental stage.\r\nWith the demise of the theory of nationalism, there\r\nis need for a new system, one that allows for the\r\ncoexistence of different cultures and identities under the\r\nroof of one homeland, as dictated by modern economic,\r\ntechnological, and practical challenges and needs.\r\nLebanon, its land and its people have had to suffer\r\nthe ravages of regional and international conflicts, the\r\nvagaries of hurricanes of international ideological\r\ndifferences and their complications. But, as ever in our\r\nhistory, we have been able to prove that we have the\r\nability to rise to the challenges that face us and that our\r\nformula for coexistence is much stronger than some\r\npeople may have believed, merely because it is the only\r\nfeasible and practicable one.\r\nWhen Lebanon was able to overcome the wars\r\nwaged by others on its soil, armed with the will of its\r\npeople and the support of its brethren and friends; when\r\nLebanon enhanced its internal security and stability,\r\nreactivated its national dialogue and tore down the\r\nbarriers between its various factions and forces; and when\r\nLebanon started to rebuild its institutions, rehabilitate its\r\ninfrastructures and embark upon its political and\r\neconomic endeavours, it proved once again that its\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\ntime-honoured existence could not be wiped out and that it\r\nwas too strong to be eliminated.\r\nBut Lebanon’s full sovereignty over all its territories\r\nand its total independence will remain compromised so long\r\nas major parts of its soil are not under its control and so\r\nlong as the State remains unable to extend its full\r\nsovereignty over all its national soil through its own\r\nlegitimate national forces.\r\nSo long as Israel occupies Lebanon’s territories,\r\ndespite repeated United Nations resolutions and the will of\r\nthe international community; so long as Lebanese citizens\r\nare still languishing in Israeli detention camps, ignored by\r\nthe international community and out of the reach of the\r\nhumanitarian organizations that are not allowed to visit\r\nthem; so long as this continues, the wounds will not heal\r\nand the blood shall not be stanched.\r\nSo long as that occupation continues over more than\r\none eighth of our national territory; so long as Israeli raids\r\ncontinue to sow the land daily with bombs, mines and\r\nbooby traps - killing mainly our innocent children; so long\r\nas these criminal acts continue against a heroic people that\r\nrefuses to surrender, the cries of our women and children\r\nwill continue to haunt the world along with our cries of\r\nanger, revolt and resistance.\r\nUntil now, the occupation has failed to contain this\r\nanger, regardless of the means employed. Day after day,\r\nthe death toll rises, ours and theirs. Blood flows in\r\nSouthern Lebanon and in the Beka’a Valley. No\r\ntechnological invention, no matter how ingenious, and no\r\ntechnique of war have been able to undermine our people’s\r\ndetermination to regain its independence, freedom,\r\nsovereignty and peace.\r\nThere are over 300 Lebanese men and women still\r\nlanguishing in Israeli prisons. Some have died; others have\r\nbeen disabled. In their prison cells, they hear about a\r\ntheory called \"human rights\", one that tops the agendas of\r\nour meetings and forums. Theorists are preoccupied over\r\nthe rights of flora, fauna and the environment while our\r\nprisoners wonder to which class they belong and under\r\nwhich category they are classified.\r\nSo long as the international community addresses the\r\nworld’s problems by using more than one standard; so long\r\nas Security Council resolutions remain unimplemented; and\r\nso long as Chapter VII of the Charter is applied selectively\r\nto troublemakers who lack any kind of protection, we\r\ncannot be deemed faithful to the true mission of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe have waited so long for the international\r\ncommunity to show some real interest. We have also\r\nwaited impatiently for the implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978), only to see the Council\r\nrefrain from condemning the aggression rather than\r\nenforce its resolutions. When it does condemn, the\r\ncondemnation applies equally to the aggressor and the\r\naggressed under the pretext of supporting the peace\r\nprocess.\r\nWe were invited to the Madrid Peace Conference.\r\nWe were optimistic about the invitation, the content and\r\nthe sponsorship. The co-sponsors were super-Powers and\r\nthe Conference was to be convened on the basis of a just,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace, anchored in the\r\nprinciple of \"land for peace\" and on the basis of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\r\n(1978) respectively. We accepted advice to join in that\r\nmechanism. By accepting the invitation, we accepted the\r\ncontent. We were expected to discuss mechanisms and\r\nschedules.\r\nThree years have passed since the convening of the\r\nMadrid Conference. Months followed upon each other’s\r\nheels in waiting, time and again, for parliamentary\r\nelections, for presidential elections, for the appropriate\r\nmoment on the local level and for circumstances aimed at\r\nimproving the position of one side while isolating or\r\ncornering the other side.\r\nThree years have passed, and our tour of world\r\ncapitals is almost complete. From Madrid to Washington,\r\nto Paris, to Oslo and to Moscow. We are still discussing\r\nthe basic principles which should have been settled the\r\nvery first moment the Conference was convened. The\r\nprinciple of \"land for peace\" still awaits the definition of\r\nthe land concept. The principle of withdrawal is still\r\nunclear, since in the way that it is proposed, it still means\r\noccupation under different forms.\r\nThe principle of negotiating land for peace, which\r\npresupposes equality in the negotiating positions, is\r\npreempted by pressuring the Arab negotiator so that he is\r\nleft with nothing to offer. Resistance must stop - so we\r\nare told - without any guarantee of withdrawal or\r\nliberation. The boycott must end, but no guarantees are\r\ngiven for the recovery of the usurped rights. We must\r\nenter the multilateral negotiations without knowing\r\nwhether or not there will be peace and what the form and\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\ncontent of that peace will be. We are asked to celebrate\r\nand to shake hands without knowing what it is we are\r\ncelebrating. We are required to take into account the local\r\npublic opinion of others; we have to reassure that public\r\nopinion of others as if we ourselves do not have a public\r\nopinion to convince and as if we do not have our own\r\nsceptics who question our opting for peace.\r\nYes, we the victims of aggression are required to give\r\nsecurity guarantees to the aggressor. Those without\r\nweapons are required to reassure those who possess nuclear,\r\nchemical and bacteriological weapons. Yes, we entered the\r\nnegotiations for peace - an honourable peace, not a guilty\r\none; a balanced peace, not a lopsided one; a just peace, not\r\nan unjust one; a comprehensive peace, not a partial one; a\r\ngenuine peace, not a festive one; an equitable peace, not a\r\nbiased one; a natural peace, not an artificial one; a\r\npermanent peace, not a temporary one; a peace of the\r\npeople, not of regimes; a peace that makes us proud, not\r\nashamed; a peace of loyalty to, not betrayal of our martyrs.\r\nWe want a peace that allows for the return of\r\nrefugees, rather than consecrates their dispersion; a peace\r\nthat satisfies the revolutionary, instead of provoking him; a\r\npeace from which we draw strength; a peace we can\r\nprotect; a peace that will, once and for all, relieve the world\r\nof this burden, the burden of our region; a peace that will\r\nput an end to exporting anger; a peace of prosperity,\r\ndevelopment, and stability; a peace that will allow our\r\nwidows to cease their mourning.\r\nThe days when the problems of peoples were confined\r\nto their own countries are over. The days when geographic\r\nand political boundaries were a barrier between peoples are\r\nover. Our era is one of interdependence and of\r\ncommunication. It is an era of the lowering of all barriers.\r\nNo country is too remote. No matter how far removed\r\nfrom the area of conflict, it will still be affected by that\r\nconflict and by the demographic problems that do not\r\nrecognize boundaries or borders, unless such problems are\r\nstemmed at the source.\r\nWe can always be subject to nuclear, chemical and\r\nbacteriological pollution, since there are no boundaries in\r\nthe atmosphere. The environment can very well become\r\ncontaminated, because the mountains cannot stop the wind\r\nfrom blowing, and nature cannot stop rivers from flowing.\r\nWe will all be affected, whenever and wherever a\r\ndisaster strikes. We are all concerned about the world’s\r\nsecurity, its stability, prosperity, resources, needs,\r\nrequirements, markets and citizens, wherever they may be.\r\nThe Middle East must not forever remain a fiery\r\nvolcano that threatens the peace of the world around it,\r\nchallenges international security, and destabilizes the\r\nworld economy. It must not remain the source of the\r\nworld’s anger and resentment.\r\nLet there be no more occupied territories, no more\r\nacts of aggression, no more prisoners languishing in the\r\nprisons. Let there be no more blood flowing through the\r\nland of the prophets. Let no more darkness prevail in the\r\ncradle of God’s religions.\r\nThis region will not enjoy more favorable\r\nopportunities than those that exist today. Time will not\r\nbe forever on the side of those who seek peace. Our\r\nregion must produce visionaries, as it has always done,\r\nand not manipulators of peace.\r\nOur congratulations to you, Sir, on the assumption\r\nof the presidency of this session of the General Assembly\r\ncannot come from the heart in isolation of what we\r\nexpect from the United Nations during your presidency.\r\nThe efforts of the Secretary-General cannot be viewed or\r\nappreciated outside the scope of our view of the United\r\nNations. May God guide you and illuminate your path in\r\nthe service of world peace to which Lebanon is dedicated\r\nand for which it fights.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jose Miguel Insulza.\r\nMr. Insulza (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMay I first congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\r\npreside over our work.\r\nI wish you every success in your presidency, and\r\nassure you that you may rely on the full cooperation of\r\nthe delegation of Chile.\r\nI wish also to greet the Secretary-General and to\r\nassure him once again of our support in the performance\r\nof his difficult task. When he visited Chile a few days\r\nafter the inauguration of President Eduardo Frei, the\r\nSecretary-General had an opportunity to appreciate our\r\nreadiness to cooperate in the activities of the United\r\nNations system, in the conviction that multilateral action\r\nwas essential to the strengthening of international peace\r\nand security and to the improvement of the living\r\nconditions of men and women the world over.\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nThe fall of the ideological barriers imposed by the\r\ncold war gave rise to expectations of an era of peace and\r\nglobal security. These expectations are strengthened by the\r\nspread of democracy and the emergence of a new\r\nawareness of the importance of human rights throughout the\r\nworld. At the same time, the processes of globalization and\r\neconomic interdependence are creating new opportunities\r\nfor progress and making the dissemination of technology\r\nand knowledge more feasible.\r\nNevertheless, five years after the end of the cold war\r\nwe must acknowledge that the reality has fallen far short of\r\nour dreams. The last decade of this century is one of\r\nuncertainty and contradictions. Regrettably, along with the\r\nsigns of hope there has been a re-emergence of many\r\neconomic, political, ethnic, religious and cultural conflicts\r\nand a tendency towards fragmentation and differentiation,\r\nwhich pose new threats to the peace and new challenges for\r\nthe international order.\r\nThis process of transition has enhanced the role of the\r\nUnited Nations as the guarantor of world peace and\r\nsecurity. It has compelled our Organization to assume new\r\nresponsibilities, both in negotiations for conflict prevention\r\nand in operations for the maintenance or restoration of\r\npeace.\r\nNevertheless, the immediate concern to maintain peace\r\nand security should not prevent us from recognizing and\r\nattacking the root causes of these conflicts. Poverty,\r\ninequality between individuals and between nations,\r\nenvironmental deterioration, unemployment and ignorance,\r\nover-population, disorganized migration, and discrimination\r\nagainst women and young people are today as important\r\nfactors in creating conflict as is military proliferation or\r\nideological confrontation - if not more so. Tackling these\r\nproblems requires using the imagination, creativity and\r\nsolidarity of the international community, as well as\r\nresources as large as or even larger than those being spent\r\ntoday on resolving conflicts that have already begun. The\r\nsecurity of human beings must be an international priority\r\nalong with widespread promotion of respect for human\r\nrights.\r\nIn March of this year a new phase in the Chilean\r\ndemocratic process began with the installation of the\r\nGovernment of President Eduardo Frei. The continuity of\r\nthis process has made it possible to strengthen the stability\r\nof democratic institutions and has increased respect for\r\nhuman rights in the country. Of course, we do not claim\r\nthat our democracy is perfect; many aspects of it still\r\nrequire further attention, and with that in mind draft\r\nlegislation on institutional changes is currently being\r\ndiscussed in the National Congress. Nevertheless, we are\r\ncertain that, together with the other countries of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, Chile will continue to\r\nadvance along the path of political stability, democratic\r\ninstitutionality and respect for human rights.\r\nOur recent economic experience has been successful.\r\nSince the return of democracy we have had an average\r\nannual growth of more than 6.5 per cent with a very low\r\nunemployment rate and controlled inflation. On the basis\r\nof these facts the Government has formulated an\r\nambitious modernization strategy focusing on three main\r\nareas: education and training, development of\r\ninfrastructure, and modernization of the State. The\r\nreforms in education seek to respond to the need for\r\neffective and creative integration of young people into\r\nsociety, and to meet the challenge of competitiveness.\r\nThe changes in the functioning of the State entail a\r\nspecial concern for ethics and probity in the exercise of\r\npower.\r\nAttainment of these priorities should enable us to\r\nraise our productivity and increase our capacity to\r\ncompete in international markets in the context of a\r\ngrowing open economy. We are concerned at the\r\ndifficulty the major countries are nevertheless\r\nexperiencing in opening up their economies in sectors that\r\nare vital to the equitable functioning of world trade. We\r\nreject an international trade system based on\r\nprotectionism by the powerful directed against those who\r\nare prepared to accept competition.\r\nNevertheless, economic advances would lack\r\nmeaning if they did not lead to a substantial improvement\r\nin the living conditions of the majority of Chileans. The\r\nGovernment recognizes this and has made the elimination\r\nof extreme poverty an essential priority of its programme.\r\nWithout equity, growth would lose its raison d’être and\r\nstability would be threatened by the tensions arising out\r\nof the privations experienced by large sectors of the\r\npopulation. Economic growth and social justice constitute\r\ntwo terms of a single equation.\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean are our natural\r\nframe of reference and external action as a region that\r\nshares both political and security interests and major\r\neconomic interests. The region has overcome the\r\npolitical, institutional and economic crisis which afflicted\r\nit in earlier decades. Most countries of the continent have\r\nrecently held elections, or will do so in the coming\r\nmonths. The tranquillity, openness and participation that\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\ntoday characterize these processes are convincing proof that\r\nLatin America has embarked on a major process of\r\nmodernization and stability.\r\nAlong with this has come a major expansion of\r\ncooperation and regional integration. Integration initiatives\r\nand mechanisms of varying geographical coverage and\r\nthematic scope have multiplied. Chile has participated in\r\nthese efforts, negotiating economic complementarity and\r\nfree-trade agreements with the majority of the countries in\r\nthe region. In the immediate future, Chile hopes to be able\r\nto make a new contribution to the creation of a broad Latin\r\nAmerican economic area by achieving closer links with the\r\nCommon Market of the Southern Cone and by signing\r\ncomplementarity agreements with Ecuador and Peru to add\r\nto those already concluded with Mexico, Venezuela,\r\nArgentina, Bolivia and Colombia.\r\nWe also view with enthusiasm the strengthening of our\r\nlinks with the Central American and Caribbean countries\r\nwith which we have significantly expanded our political and\r\neconomic relations and cooperation.\r\nWe wish to promote a climate of peace, dialogue,\r\nsolidarity and mutual trust among the countries of the\r\nregion. We are sure that today this is more possible than\r\nbefore, given the presence in the region of more democratic\r\nregimes than it has ever had in its history.\r\nIn this context, the Rio Group has become a\r\nsignificant regional political cooperation mechanism, and its\r\nactivity has recently expanded to cover economic\r\ncoordination aspects. The strengthening of the Rio Group,\r\nwhich emerged from our continent’s re-democratization and\r\nresurgence, is a key to Latin American’s ability to speak\r\nwith a unified voice in the new international context. That\r\nis how our main partners in the world, with whom we meet\r\nperiodically in discussion forums to which we are attaching\r\nincreasing importance, perceive it.\r\nOur policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nis fully compatible with closer integration into world\r\nmarkets. Chile today is a country that is open to the world,\r\ndependent for 40 per cent of its gross national product on\r\nexternal transactions and seeking to strengthen its relations\r\nwith the dynamic centres of growth and technological\r\ninformation. We define our policy as an open regionalism,\r\none which seeks regional integration not in order to close\r\nits markets but in order to achieve greater integration into\r\nthe world economy.\r\nIn this connection, our preference for multilateralism\r\nis well known. We support all the phases of the\r\nextensive negotiations under the Uruguay Round of the\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and are\r\nnow in the process of ratifying the agreements reached\r\nthere.\r\nOur attitude in this respect matches that of our main\r\npartners in Latin America. During the eight years for\r\nwhich the Uruguay Round lasted the countries of the\r\nregion unilaterally reduced their tariffs by an average of\r\nmore than 50 per cent and contributed by making\r\nsignificant concessions, despite the fact that not all the\r\nobjectives they were seeking to negotiate were achieved.\r\nAccordingly, we now have the right to call for the\r\nresults of the Round to be implemented and, once the\r\nWorld Trade Organization has been established, for\r\nprogress to be made in discussion of the many problems\r\nthe Round left pending, especially in relation to\r\nagriculture and services.\r\nNevertheless, it is obvious that in the current phase\r\nof the world economy multilateralism is being\r\naccompanied by the negotiation of partial or regional\r\neconomic agreements which are progressively extending\r\nover a large part of international trading activity. Hence\r\nour interest in the integration progress in North America,\r\nour search for sounder and more imaginative patterns of\r\neconomic relations with the European Union, our\r\nimminent entry into the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation Council (APEC) and our constant readiness,\r\nshared with our region, to move ahead with economic\r\ncooperation with all regions of the world.\r\nCurrent international circumstances have led to\r\nprogress in various areas which it is important to\r\nemphasize: the defeat of racism and apartheid, progress\r\nin disarmament, the solution of international conflicts,\r\ncooperation and détente - all issues which have led to the\r\nstrengthening of the world Organization.\r\nChile salutes the people and the Government of the\r\nnew South Africa in the person of President Nelson\r\nMandela and welcomes the success achieved by the\r\nUnited Nations and by the South African people\r\nthemselves in building a democratic and just South Africa\r\nwhich respects the principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe wish also to express our support for the peace\r\nand negotiation process under way in Angola and\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nMozambique. We urge the rebel forces in both countries\r\nto negotiate seriously and in good faith to end this conflict,\r\nin compliance with United Nations resolutions. In the case\r\nof Angola, the date of 30 September set by the President of\r\nthe Security Council for the ending of the negotiations is\r\napproaching, and it is accordingly essential to arrive at a\r\nspeedy solution on the basis of the \"Acordos de Paz\".\r\nLet me also express our satisfaction at the progress\r\nmade through the agreements between Israel and the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization, which are overcoming\r\nobstacles to the attainment of a lasting peace throughout the\r\nMiddle East. On behalf of my country, I wish to reiterate\r\nour support for the negotiations under way between Israel\r\nand Jordan, as well as those between Israel and Lebanon\r\nand between Israel and Syria.\r\nIn contrast to these positive steps, we view with great\r\nconcern the tragedy in Rwanda, horrified at its magnitude\r\nand at the inability of the international community to\r\ncontain it. Chile conducted a national campaign of\r\nsolidarity with the children of Rwanda which met with an\r\nextremely good response in our country. The risk is that,\r\nif efforts are not made to eliminate the deep-lying causes of\r\ntragedies such as this, other similar sources of tension may\r\narise in other countries, testing the capacity of our system\r\nto react.\r\nLikewise, we cannot fail to express our most profound\r\nconcern at and most energetic rejection of the extremes to\r\nwhich the fratricidal struggle in the former Yugoslavia has\r\nbeen taken. We urge the warring parties to abandon the\r\nuse of force as a means of solving their disputes and to\r\nsubmit them to the internationally recognized peaceful\r\nmeans of settlement.\r\nChile is also profoundly concerned at the situation in\r\nHaiti resulting from the protracted usurpation of power and\r\nthe non-implementation of the Governors Island\r\nagreements. The military occupation of a country is always\r\na regrettable occurrence that we should all like to avoid.\r\nNevertheless, it is important to recognize that in this\r\ninstance such action was taken on the basis of a Security\r\nCouncil resolution and in response to repeated failure to\r\ncomply with international commitments, failure for which\r\nthe Haitian military alone are responsible.\r\nWe reiterate in this Assembly our support for the\r\nmeasures taken by the United Nations and, in particular,\r\nour full acceptance of the resolution adopted by the\r\nSecurity Council. The Government of Chile will fulfil its\r\ncommitments to participate in the reconstruction of Haiti,\r\nin the manner agreed upon with the democratic\r\nGovernment of that country, as soon as institutional order\r\nhas been restored.\r\nChile has cooperated in peace-keeping operations,\r\nand it has recently expressed its readiness to expand that\r\ncooperation, in the profound conviction that improving the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations system in these efforts is\r\na priority task. The current bureaucratic mechanisms,\r\nwhich place a very heavy burden on the countries\r\nproviding peace-keeping contingents, must be replaced by\r\nothers that will make it possible to provide the United\r\nNations with the best in human resources and equipment.\r\nIt is essential to reach agreement on a statute for\r\nprotection of United Nations personnel and to create an\r\ninternational fund to administer the financing of\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nThe new impetus in international disarmament\r\nnegotiations, particularly with respect to a nuclear-test-ban\r\ntreaty, increases the need for a global, democratic and\r\nparticipatory approach in this area. There is an urgent\r\nneed to increase the membership of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament - the only major multilateral negotiating\r\nforum on these topics - to make it sufficiently\r\nrepresentative and enable it to respond appropriately to\r\nthe new challenges.\r\nChile considers that prohibiting the use of fissionable\r\nmaterials for hostile purposes and universalizing security\r\nguarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States would be\r\npositive steps in the direction of nuclear disarmament.\r\nNevertheless, their success would depend on full\r\nacceptance of inspection and verification procedures. In\r\nstep with progress in the substantive negotiations, a need\r\nis making itself felt to extend and expand safeguards and\r\ncontrol regimes until they become universal, without\r\nthereby impeding the access of developing countries to\r\nsources of science and technology.\r\nThe recent ratification of the Treaty of Tlatelolco by\r\nChile, Argentina and Brazil, as well as Cuba’s decision to\r\nsign it, will enable Latin America to become a genuine\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. This, together with the\r\nmanifest reduction in tension and armaments in the\r\nregion, constitutes an effective contribution by our region\r\nto world peace.\r\nIn this context, we have indicated our interest in\r\nbecoming a member of the Security Council for the\r\nperiod beginning 1996. We have done so convinced that\r\nChile can legitimately and adequately represent the\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\ninterests of Latin America and the Caribbean in that\r\nimportant body.\r\nWe can and must make substantive progress in\r\ndesigning better systems for preventing conflicts or taking\r\nimmediate action to restore peace. But, unless we\r\nsimultaneously attack the enormous inequalities and\r\nprivations that lie at the root of many conflicts we shall not\r\nsignificantly reduce international tensions. The origins of\r\nthese tensions lie in the exclusion of major sectors of the\r\nworld’s population from the benefits of the new order, an\r\nexclusion aggravated by population growth and by the\r\ncharacteristics of the new world economy, for when factors\r\nsuch as knowledge and technology come to outweigh\r\nothers, such as the availability of raw materials or low-cost\r\nlabour, the hopes of those who possess only an abundance\r\nof the latter are increasingly disappointed, thus widening\r\nand deepening the social gaps within and between\r\ncountries.\r\nFrom a bitter past, Chile has learned the lesson of the\r\nclose relationship that exists between peace, democracy,\r\neconomic growth and social development. The central\r\nobjective of a security policy is the security of individuals\r\nand of the communities in which they live. The\r\naccentuation of inequality or exclusion is not only ethically\r\nunacceptable, but also politically dangerous. No new\r\ninternational order will be stable or lasting if it is based on\r\nthe exclusion of the majority of those who comprise it.\r\nWe are convinced that the absence of democracy and\r\nthe lack of economic growth centred on the human being\r\nare at the root of the international instability that\r\ncharacterizes our era. President Frei has spoken of a\r\n\"diplomacy for development\", referring in these terms to\r\nthe necessity to adjust foreign policy to the objectives and\r\nneeds of each country and to the link that must necessarily\r\nexist between our international action and our internal\r\nobjective of growth with equity. We therefore attach the\r\ngreatest importance to the Agenda for Development that is\r\nunder discussion in the United Nations.\r\nThis was the thinking behind the convening of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, unanimously\r\napproved by the General Assembly. The analysis by Heads\r\nof State and Government in Copenhagen next March should\r\nlead us to a new policy to combat poverty, promote\r\nemployment and accelerate social integration. In particular,\r\nwe believe that the social Summit should adopt a common\r\ncommitment to eradicate extreme poverty in the world\r\nthrough a concrete and efficient plan of action. What is\r\ndecided there will be intimately linked to the conditions of\r\nsecurity and coexistence in the emerging international\r\norder.\r\nThe social Summit, together with the recent\r\nConference on Population and Development, held in\r\nCairo, the World Conference on Women, to be held in\r\nBeijing in 1995, and the Secretary-General’s proposed\r\nAgenda for Development, indicates the growing interest\r\nthat this Organization is taking in social issues.\r\nChile intends to comply with the agreements reached\r\nat the Rio de Janeiro Summit and to promote a new\r\npolicy on environmental issues. In this context, its\r\nNational Congress recently approved the Convention on\r\nBiological Diversity, and our ratification has just been\r\ndeposited with the United Nations. In turn, we are\r\nconvinced that environmental problems will remain\r\nunresolved, and may even become exacerbated, if the\r\nnecessary resources are not available to deal with them\r\nthrough joint action by developed and developing\r\ncountries. This is becoming increasingly apparent in\r\nsome developing countries, where poverty is accelerating\r\nenvironmental deterioration as a result of the excessive\r\nand uncontrolled use of certain resources.\r\nThe dual task of maintaining peace and at the same\r\ntime creating conditions for the elimination of structural\r\nsources of conflict is an enormous challenge to this\r\nOrganization. Nevertheless, we are convinced that if we\r\ndo not take up the challenge we shall reach the beginning\r\nof the next millennium without having laid the real\r\nfoundations for a new international order that will permit\r\nthe peaceful coexistence of mankind.\r\nTaking up this challenge is not a task for the major\r\nPowers alone, although their involvement is essential;\r\nrather, it is a task for all nations capable of making a\r\ncontribution - especially the medium-sized countries,\r\nwhich make up a large part of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nChile is prepared to be a part of this effort, as are,\r\nwe are sure, all the countries of Latin America. The\r\ncentral role of this Organization must be strengthened and\r\nsupported in the crucial years that lie ahead, for this is the\r\nonly way to ensure that the settlement of conflicts does\r\nnot alter international legality, that arbitrary intervention\r\nis prevented and that the rights of the weakest are\r\nrespected.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency Mr. Benjamin\r\n40\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nBounkoulou, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and\r\nFrancophonie of the Congo.\r\nMr. Bounkoulou (Congo) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): At this forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations, the African continent has\r\nevery right to feel honoured in this great body. Through\r\nthe brilliant election of its President, our Assembly has paid\r\na tribute to the merits and the qualities of a great African\r\ndiplomat. I would add that above and beyond the\r\nrecognition so richly deserved by his country, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, for its contribution to peace, we also find in his\r\nelection a posthumous tribute to its founder, President\r\nHouphouët Boigny, that unforgettable monument of\r\nmodern-day Africa. I would like to extend to our President\r\nthe warmest congratulations of the Congolese delegation\r\nand to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a well-\r\ndeserved tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\r\nSamuel Insanally, Ambassador of Guyana, who served as\r\nPresident at the forty-eighth session with such great\r\ncompetence and skill.\r\nMy congratulations go also to our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who since becoming the leader\r\nof our Organization has endeavoured with such dedication\r\nto bring our Member States closer to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter. On behalf of the Congolese\r\npeople, I would like to reiterate to this humble servant of\r\nmankind our most earnest encouragement as he discharges\r\nhis lofty responsibilities.\r\nMany peace-keeping and goodwill missions of the\r\nUnited Nations are currently to be found on African soil.\r\nWe welcome this necessary assistance, while we hope that\r\nthe peoples concerned will do even better in fostering\r\nconditions for a return to peace.\r\nFinally, how can one not feel overcome with joy at the\r\ntriumphant welcome given the return of the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa to the commonwealth of free nations? This\r\nreturn, which puts the finishing touches on the liberation of\r\nthe African continent from colonialism and racism, is surely\r\na source of legitimate satisfaction for the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations who devoted so much energy and so many\r\nresources in the battle of the South African people against\r\napartheid. To the delegation of that country that embodies\r\nthe hopes of an entire continent, I would like to extend a\r\nwarm, fraternal welcome.\r\nAt the beginning of this forty-ninth session the\r\nAssembly faces a complicated situation that combines real\r\nreasons for satisfaction with extremely worrisome issues.\r\nA marked trend towards dialogue and cooperation in\r\nsearch of solutions to the problems that confront our\r\nworld encourages our desire for a new system of\r\ninternational relations that would be more humane and\r\nmore just. The United Nations has to its credit many\r\nachievements in the restoration and creation of peace.\r\nConflicts that have been solved or are in the process of\r\nbeing solved give, little by little, faith and confidence in\r\nthe future, indeed I would say to life, to those peoples\r\nwho have been subjugated by despair, if not by the\r\ndisturbing resurgence of civil wars, ethnic tensions and\r\nreligious crusades.\r\nThe abolition of apartheid in South Africa, which\r\nseemed impossible yesterday, is a reality today, as if to\r\ngrant the wishes of the international community and to\r\nreward the strictures of the United Nations, a peaceful\r\ntransition has given birth to a united, democratic and non-\r\nracist South Africa.\r\nA peaceful settlement to the question of the Aouzou\r\nstrip has rid Central Africa of a fratricidal conflict. I\r\nhope the example of Libya and Chad will inspire other\r\nStates as well.\r\nFirmly and resolutely, the dynamic of peace begun\r\nin the Middle East is growing stronger and is opening\r\nprospects for cooperation to peoples long ruined by war\r\nand yet fated by geography and history to live together.\r\nThis is why, in hailing the significant progress achieved\r\nin this process, the Republic of the Congo hopes that we\r\nwill see rapid progress in the Arab-Israeli negotiations\r\nwith a view to the establishment of a thorough, just and\r\nlasting peace in the Middle East.\r\nBut the hope offered by the progress that has been\r\nachieved remains frustrated by the persistence of local\r\nwars that continue their bloodshed in various parts of the\r\nworld. Political differences and ethnic, racial or religious\r\ndiversity, far from enriching society, have elicited\r\nintolerance, hatred, violence and, worst of all, the\r\ndestruction of what is most precious to us all: human\r\nlife. From Bosnia to Angola, the similarities are striking.\r\nOf these crises that conceal several basic questions, we\r\nsee that a record number are in Africa: Angola, Somalia,\r\nLiberia, Rwanda ...\r\nThe Republic of the Congo remains greatly\r\nconcerned about the situation in its sister republic and\r\nneighbour Angola. We deplore the continuation of this\r\nfratricidal, murderous war, sustained by the intransigence\r\nand rigidity of UNITA. The Congolese Government\r\n41\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nsupports all peace efforts undertaken by the international\r\ncommunity in the attempt to settle the conflict peacefully,\r\nespecially as part of the Lusaka negotiations: negotiations\r\nin which Angola has made very constructive proposals that\r\nshow the determination of President Dos Santos and his\r\nGovernment to find a solution that might take into account\r\nall the political sensibilities of that country. My country\r\nwould like to reiterate its wish to see Angolans finally\r\nreach understanding and reconciliation, so that they can\r\ndevote their energies to the rebuilding of their country, torn\r\napart by a war that has lasted far too long.\r\nWith regard to Liberia, we hope that the recent signing\r\nin Ghana of the cease-fire agreement by the various\r\nprotagonists will lead to better prospects for that country.\r\nThe genocide we have seen in Rwanda, another sad\r\nchapter in the history of mankind, is only the most extreme\r\nand inhuman manifestation of the problems facing Africa\r\ntoday. Violence, poverty, famine, disease, refugees,\r\nspiralling population growth - such is the widespread image\r\nof contemporary Africa. This well-known, gloomy picture\r\nno doubt stems from a habitual pessimism rather than from\r\na thorough study of reality.\r\nThe increase in the inequality between the richest and\r\nthe poorest countries has grown more complex with the\r\nemergence of worldwide markets, trade, communications -\r\neven, unfortunately, pollution. Africa, long relegated to the\r\nbackground, seems to have combined all the social\r\npathologies that inexorably strike ever-growing and ever-\r\npoorer populations. In our underdeveloped countries,\r\nchronic indebtedness and the drop in the prices of our basic\r\ncommodities, compounded by the pernicious reduction in\r\npublic aid for development and investments that continue to\r\nignore our legislation, however attractive and liberal it may\r\nbe, are worsening the disappearance of sources of financing\r\nand development.\r\nHere growth is slow to appear, whereas early signs\r\nalready herald the beginnings of expansion in the world\r\neconomy. The unemployed population is increasing, and\r\nworkers are under a constant uncertainty. As if to complete\r\nthis picture, natural disasters - drought and desertification -\r\ncompete with epidemics such as AIDS and malaria.\r\nInfections we thought to have eradicated are reappearing.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIn this context of a disastrous economy, a population\r\nexplosion has eliminated any hope of redressing the\r\nimbalance between an almost zero economic growth rate\r\nand a population growth rate that is out of control. This\r\nsituation has destroyed all our efforts at recovery.\r\nCongo, for its part, has not escaped this common\r\ndestiny. The socio-political crisis which has shaken my\r\ncountry to its very foundations and brought great grief to\r\nmany Congolese families has to a large extent torn the\r\nsocial fabric and has completely ruined our economy.\r\nThis crisis has at least had the merit of destroying many\r\nillusions.\r\nWe had thought - or pretended to think - that it was\r\nenough simply to copy the old Western democracies and\r\nhold free elections under international supervision to\r\nensure that democracy prospered, that it was unnecessary\r\nto take local realities into account.\r\nSurely the European Parliament learned a bitter\r\nlesson from its failure, because it said to the new\r\ndemocracies that peoples and Governments should find\r\nformulas which would enable them to create democratic,\r\nlawful institutions based on their own history and cultural\r\nidentity.\r\nHow can we claim that in two years’ time we have\r\ndone away with the ills of 30 years of badly assimilated\r\nMarxist-Leninist culture, a culture which was\r\nfundamentally hostile to pluralistic democracy and\r\nfundamentally opposed to individual growth. And what\r\nshould we say of the harmful effects of so many years of\r\nMarxist management of an economy that is today doomed\r\nbecause of that failure?\r\nCongo’s economy today is suffering from the\r\ndisastrous consequences of ill-advised economic policies,\r\nwhich has given my country the honour of being placed\r\namong the most indebted countries in the world. In\r\naddition to this economic bankruptcy we find the waste,\r\nthe ruin of our cultural and moral values, and a\r\nbreakdown of the innate genius of our people.\r\nInsidious and pernicious, destitution and poverty\r\nhave crept into the private lives of men and women,\r\nevery day becoming more numerous, men and women\r\nwho to survive must hide behind the ultimate bulwark of\r\nethnicity, which has become a factor for segregation and\r\ndivision.\r\nMade idle and vulnerable, and subjected to chronic\r\nunemployment, our youth are now indulging in the\r\nillusion of drugs and the armed defence of dubious\r\ncauses.\r\n42\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nThus, we see the scope of the consequences of so\r\nmany harmful factors in a society where people have lost\r\nall sense of perspective. Violence then becomes the outlet\r\nfor venting all sorts of political, economic and social\r\nfrustrations.\r\nThe outbreaks of violence in the Congo are the most\r\nabsurd manifestation of this. We must rely on our\r\ntraditional values to revive our dedication to dialogue and\r\npeace and hence realize how vain such extreme behaviour\r\nis - indeed, nothing more than human folly.\r\nWe have given new life to the democratic process; we\r\nhave started all over again. This is a process redirected\r\ntowards democratic transition, the first stage of power-\r\nsharing; it is the result of a policy of administrative\r\ndecentralization, one of the foundations of the development\r\nprogramme of President Pascal Lissouba. Today leaders of\r\nthe opposition are mayors of Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire -\r\nthe main cities in the country - and are thereby making\r\ntheir contribution to the national recovery.\r\nCongo’s experience highlights the challenges facing\r\nthe new democracies, in particular young African\r\ndemocracies, which in order to build one nation must\r\nemerge from the condition of multi-ethnic States and one-\r\nparty or feudal systems and pass on to full democracy with\r\nits corollary, a market economy.\r\nIn order to meet these challenges, Congo has opted for\r\na programme of economic and social recovery that is\r\nalready under way. The programme involves the\r\nrelaunching of our country’s development.\r\nOur bitter experience has led us to conclude that we\r\nmust give pride of place to the economy in order to\r\nsafeguard the young and fragile Congolese democracy and\r\ngive it a solid basis, especially taking into account the\r\ncrucial needs of our peoples, our own values and\r\ngeopolitical realities.\r\nTo fulfil this objective, the programme involves in its\r\ninitial phase a structural adjustment programme concluded\r\nwith the Bretton Woods institutions, a programme we are\r\ndetermined to carry out successfully in spite of the\r\nenormous sacrifices this will entail for our people. This\r\nmust be done because we are determined to stimulate\r\ndevelopment and to revive hope among our people. We are\r\nbanking on relaunching progress, but Congo cannot succeed\r\nalone. Africa is our salvation.\r\nIndeed, it is in the integration and complementarity\r\nof our economies that we should try to find solutions so\r\nthat we can emerge from the grave economic and social\r\ncrisis that has engulfed our countries, and especially\r\nrelaunch our growth and development. Let us hope that\r\nthe African States will be able to create the conditions for\r\nthis complementarity, especially through the use of\r\nscience and technology.\r\nThis initiative gives a good idea of the crucial\r\nimportance of the establishment of the African Economic\r\nCommunity. But in order to succeed this endeavour\r\nrequires human as well as financial resources. In this\r\nconnection, the international community is called upon to\r\ngive resolute help to our countries in their efforts to find\r\ncompetent men and women who can promote\r\ndevelopment by their know-how, in the appropriate\r\ninstitutions.\r\nDevelopment and the effective use of human\r\nresources are a decisive factor for the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of our African continent. That is why,\r\nguided by this requirement of development, the Congolese\r\nGovernment has established the Panafrican Institute of\r\nManagement and Innovation to train people in the\r\nmanagement of resources, including human resources.\r\nFor the initiator of this project, His Excellency\r\nPresident Pascal Lissouba, development cannot be defined\r\nsolely in terms of growth; it must also be defined in terms\r\nof the ability to master the art of management.\r\nThe second requirement of this endeavour is to fund\r\nit. In this connection, we are not relying only on\r\nfinancial resources - that is, a massive influx of capital\r\ninto our poor economies. The economies would still have\r\nto be able to digest such capital.\r\nAbove and beyond the generation of financial flows\r\nto our countries, what Africa needs above all is the\r\nestablishment of a financial instrument, whose machinery\r\nwould be brought into harmony with the other, existing\r\ninstruments of international cooperation. This financial\r\ninstrument, with the support of all the African countries,\r\nwould obtain appropriate support from the international\r\ncommunity, especially the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nThus, the African Development Bank is in our view\r\nthe best institution to deal with the financial aspect and,\r\nfurthermore, to study a system for funding science and\r\ntechnology for development. Today more than ever\r\n43\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nbefore, science and technology are part and parcel of\r\ndevelopment; they are requirements of development.\r\nThe favourable developments in the world political\r\nsituation have given rise to the hope that a new era of\r\npeace will give the United Nations the role that its founders\r\nintended it to play.\r\nEverything - or almost everything - would seem to\r\naugur well for a new world order: an outpouring of\r\nfreedom and democracy; a revival of the universal\r\nawareness of human rights; and the pre-eminence of the\r\nUnited Nations in resolving issues linked to international\r\npeace, development and security.\r\nUnfortunately, the psychosis of nuclear apocalypse\r\ncharacteristic of the cold war has given way to a violent,\r\ndeadly expression of freedom and of local wars in a large\r\nnumber of developing countries, especially in Africa. We\r\nhave already stated that economic frustration is at the root\r\nof these events. Therefore, peace and security in our States\r\nand throughout the world require a solution to our people’s\r\neconomic and social problems as well as the transformation\r\nof the world economic system with a view to establishing\r\na more just order. It is only then that we can have a true\r\nidea of the Agenda for Development and of its capability of\r\nmeeting the expectations and concerns of the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe vagaries of the Rwandan tragedy, especially at the\r\ntime when the critical decision was taken by the Security\r\nCouncil to withdraw the United Nations Assistance Mission\r\nfor Rwanda (UNAMIR), should awaken the conscience of\r\npeople everywhere and make them pause and reflect. The\r\njoint efforts of the United Nations and of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) were crystal-clear. The continent-\r\nwide organization, through its conflict-prevention,\r\n-management and -resolution machinery, had committed\r\nitself to continuing these efforts.\r\nMy country welcomes the return of United Nations\r\npeace-keeping forces to Rwanda after a departure that had\r\nleft us with the bitter feeling that the decision was\r\ninappropriate.\r\nCongo, in spite of its internal difficulties, from the\r\nvery outset had felt concerned over the Rwandan tragedy.\r\nIn a manifestation of fraternal solidarity, my country has\r\ntaken part in all the humanitarian and peace-keeping\r\noperations in Rwanda, ranging from the OAU observer\r\nmission, UNAMIR I and operation \"Turquoise\" to today’s\r\nUNAMIR II.\r\nIn drawing conclusions from these tragic events, the\r\n11 States of Central Africa, brought together in the\r\nUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security\r\nQuestions in Central Africa, have decided to create from\r\namong their respective armed forces a single peace-\r\nkeeping unit. This unit, once set up, will take part in\r\nOAU and United Nations peace-keeping operations.\r\nToday more than ever, in that part of Africa so sorely\r\ntried by instability and civil war, this advisory committee\r\nwould appear to be a valuable instrument for preventing\r\ncrises and conflicts and seems deserving of the attention\r\nand support of the international community. The recent\r\nsigning of a non-aggression pact among the States of the\r\nsubregion is a most concrete example of this.\r\nThis framework body for joint efforts for subregional\r\npeace and security, which my country will host in March\r\nand August 1995, will help, we are convinced, to prevent\r\ncrises and conflicts and thereby lay the foundations for\r\ngenuine peace and cooperation in Central Africa.\r\nIn an international context where we still see certain\r\nconflicts, we must acknowledge once again the pre-\r\neminent role of the Security Council, which safeguards\r\ninternational peace and security. The spectacular increase\r\nin the membership of the United Nations as well as the\r\nemergence of new political and economic forces the\r\nworld over require an expansion of this body on the basis\r\nof equitable geographic representation. In so doing, we\r\nwould only be abiding by the criterion of universality,\r\nwhich has always guided our Organization and which\r\nmust be constantly adapted to newly emerging realities.\r\nOur destinies are bound to become increasingly\r\nintertwined, our horizons to broaden, and all this in a\r\nspirit of diversity, complementarity and solidarity without\r\nany will to power or domination. Increased developments\r\nin science and technology will result in a globalization of\r\nthe challenges we must face.\r\n44\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 27 September 1994\r\nMay we be able to make the best possible use of the\r\nvast potential open to us, so that our long-suffering peoples\r\nwill finally see the dawning of the era of peace and\r\nprosperity they so legitimately desire.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.10 p.m.\r\n45\r\n"
