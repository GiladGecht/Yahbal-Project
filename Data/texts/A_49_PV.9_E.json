(Côte d’Ivoire)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.40 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Levon Ter-Petrossian, President of the\r\nRepublic of Armenia\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Armenia.\r\nMr. Levon Ter-Petrossian, President of the Republic\r\nof Armenia, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Armenia, His Excellency Mr. Levon Ter-\r\nPetrossian, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ter-Petrossian (interpretation from\r\nFrench): May I begin by warmly congratulating you, Sir,\r\non your election to the presidency of the forty-ninth session\r\nof the United Nations General Assembly. I would also like\r\nto express my appreciation to your predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, and to thank him for his\r\ncontribution to accomplishing the tasks of the last session.\r\nFurther, I wish to express our gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the\r\nvision with which he has guided the Organization and for\r\nhis tireless efforts to ensure the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe collapse of the old order and the emergence of\r\nnew democracies in Central and Eastern Europe and, soon\r\nafter, in the former Soviet Union have presented the\r\nworld with a major challenge. In a period of tremendous\r\nchange, many difficulties and conflicts have arisen. Some\r\nof these difficulties come as immediate by-products of\r\nrapid and haphazard transformations, while others are\r\nsurfacing for the first time after decades of inadequate\r\nstop-gap measures. Further, if the reform programmes\r\nhave so far failed to yield all the benefits expected, this\r\nis also due to an under-estimation of the differences in the\r\ninitial conditions of the countries in transition.\r\nThe pace and comprehensiveness of economic\r\nreforms will vary from country to country. However, the\r\nreform process will inevitably be lengthy, as it involves\r\nwholesale changes in price mechanisms, in the concept of\r\nproperty, in industrial structures and in legal, commercial\r\nand financial institutions, as well as the creation of social\r\nsafety nets for the most vulnerable segments of the\r\npopulation, whose situation will be worsened by the high\r\ncost of the reforms.\r\nAs with all the former Soviet Republics, Armenia’s\r\neconomy has been badly strained by the changes which\r\nfollowed the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the\r\ndifficult transition to a market economy. It is further\r\ncrippled by its over-reliance on trade with the former\r\nSoviet Republics; the blockade of transportation routes\r\nimposed by neighbouring Azerbaijan; an embargo by\r\nTurkey; and the damage inflicted by the disastrous\r\nearthquake in 1988. Other external conditions, such as\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nthe disruption of transport due to the difficulties faced by\r\nGeorgia, have exacerbated the situation, contributing to the\r\ndecline in Armenia’s industrial productivity. The legacy of\r\nthe Soviet period, with its inefficiencies and excessive\r\nhorizontal integration, has worsened the effects of the\r\nblockade.\r\nDespite these difficulties, the Armenian Government\r\nhas begun implementing significant structural reforms to\r\ncreate a healthy market economy, beginning with the\r\nprivatization process launched soon after the Armenian\r\nNational Movement came to power in 1990. Indeed, the\r\ncommitment to transform the centrally planned economy\r\ninto a market economy stems from the philosophy of the\r\ndemocratic movement in Armenia and is seen as an integral\r\npart of the transition to a democratic State.\r\nIn turn, a free market economy will flourish in a stable\r\ndemocracy, able to promote and underpin economic\r\ndevelopment. Armenia today is a country with more than\r\n30 registered political parties. It has proclaimed freedom\r\nof the press, freedom of conscience and freedom of\r\nreligion, and it has laws guaranteeing civil and political\r\nrights. Three free elections have already been held in\r\nArmenia: parliamentary and presidential elections and a\r\nreferendum on independence. The upcoming referendum\r\non the Constitution and the elections of the National\r\nAssembly and the President of the Republic will reaffirm\r\nthe establishment of a democratic tradition.\r\nDemocracy is fundamental to the process of economic\r\ntransformation, which can be divided into three phases,\r\nmore or less typical for all countries in transition:\r\ninstitutional reforms; long-term investments and changes of\r\ntechnological structures; and integration into international\r\nmarkets. It is imperative, however, to set priorities and to\r\nidentify the most pressing issues of the moment. In my\r\nopinion, Armenia is at the end of the first phase, which\r\nincludes the creation of a legal framework for economic\r\nreform, within which private economic activity can take\r\nplace, a framework ensuring that contracts are enforced and\r\nthat private property is protected; freeing of prices;\r\nprivatization; adoption of a national currency; financial and\r\nbudgetary stabilization; and improvement in the balance of\r\npayments. We have already accomplished 80 per cent of\r\nthis phase.\r\nArmenia has distinguished itself as the first among the\r\nformer Soviet Republics to privatize the ownership of\r\nagricultural land and livestock production. The\r\nprivatization of small and medium businesses as well as\r\nlarge enterprises is well under way. In late 1993, with the\r\ncollapse of the rouble zone, Armenia faced a monetary\r\ncrisis. The uncontrollable flow of old Soviet roubles into\r\nArmenia and Armenia’s subsequent inability to control\r\nmonetary policy on its own territory forced the\r\nGovernment in November 1993 prematurely to introduce\r\na national currency, the dram. The Government is\r\ncurrently implementing a programme based on controlling\r\nand lowering the inflation rate, enforcing a strict budget,\r\ncontrolling fiscal expenditures and targeting assistance to\r\nthe most vulnerable groups.\r\nBasic reforms have been undertaken in the banking\r\nsector, the first of which was to break down the mono-\r\nbank system of central planning into a two-tiered system\r\ncomprising a central bank and a group of commercial\r\nbanks.\r\nIn Armenia, as in all the emerging democracies,\r\nthere is no historical precedent for the economic\r\ntransition. It requires lasting commitment and patience as\r\nwell as the substantial support of the international\r\ncommunity. Of course neither short- and medium-term\r\nadjustment programmes nor long-term development\r\nstrategies can hope to succeed fully without sustained\r\ngrowth in the world economy and favourable external\r\nconditions.\r\nWe recognize that there is no single model of\r\ntransition to be prescribed for all countries or, even more\r\nnarrowly, for all post-communist societies as a whole. To\r\nensure success for United Nations efforts in the countries\r\nin transition the Organization must tailor its involvement\r\nto each country’s resources and procedures, giving\r\npriority to programmes rather than to projects. That\r\napproach essentially boils down to the definition of key\r\nobjectives for each programme that will reflect the\r\npriorities of the national Government and the organization\r\nof assistance around the achievement of those goals,\r\nwhich can be accomplished by strengthening the role of\r\nthe Resident Coordinator system.\r\nArmenia appreciates the Secretary-General’s Agenda\r\nfor Development as an important and necessary\r\ncomplement to \"An Agenda for Peace\". It is a\r\ncomprehensive and thoughtful reflection upon the various\r\ndimensions of development and the role of the United\r\nNations in that connection. At the recently held world\r\ngatherings on development there was broad agreement\r\nthat the Agenda should be sustained by an action-oriented\r\nframework and practical proposals aimed at resolving\r\nexisting imbalances in the various development areas.\r\nWe look forward to the further elaboration of the Agenda\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nfor Development by the Secretary-General through a\r\nnumber of concrete proposals with regard to the reform of\r\nboth the United Nations system and the intergovernmental\r\nconsultative machinery for development, as well as specific\r\nrecommendations for greater coordination within the United\r\nNations as a whole, including the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the proposed World Trade Organization.\r\nSuch an elaboration is needed if the Agenda is to lead to a\r\nglobal partnership for development.\r\nArmenia looks forward to participating in and\r\ncontributing to the World Summit for Social Development\r\nin Copenhagen. The World Summit, to be held in the\r\nUnited Nations fiftieth anniversary year, is a landmark\r\nevent and will build upon the commitments of a series of\r\nUnited Nations global gatherings, including the 1990 World\r\nSummit for Children, the 1992 United Nations Conference\r\non Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro and the\r\n1994 International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment in Cairo, and it will be followed by the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.\r\nThese are all key events in the process of international\r\nconsensus-building.\r\nDevelopment and human rights are interrelated and\r\nmutually reinforcing. There can be no genuine long-term\r\ndevelopment without respect for the full spectrum of the\r\nrights of individuals. The Vienna Conference on Human\r\nRights held last year deepened the understanding of the\r\nsignificance of human rights for stability, freedom, peace,\r\nprogress and justice. The establishment of the post of\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights was\r\nvital to a more effective implementation of the principles of\r\nhuman rights. Member States must continue to work to\r\nincrease the effectiveness of existing United Nations\r\nhuman-rights mechanisms and to support the High\r\nCommissioner in the fulfilment of his mandate.\r\nArmenia considers self-determination in its multitude\r\nof manifestations to be an inalienable human right.\r\nArmenia’s position on the Nagorny Karabakh conflict has\r\nbeen clear and consistent from the start. Armenia has no\r\nterritorial claims against Azerbaijan. The conflict is\r\nbetween the people of Nagorny Karabakh, who are striving\r\nfor self-determination, and the Azerbaijani Government,\r\nwhich is refusing to address the rights of the people of\r\nNagorny Karabakh. Armenia provides moral, diplomatic\r\nand humanitarian assistance to the people of Nagorny\r\nKarabakh, and it cannot accept a military solution which\r\ncan only mean the genocide or deportation of the\r\npopulation of Nagorny Karabakh.\r\nWhile the Nagorny Karabakh conflict has gone\r\nthrough periods of both intense fighting and relative calm\r\nsince I spoke here two years ago, there has never before\r\nbeen a period in the five-year history of the conflict when\r\na cease-fire has taken hold for so long. I am pleased to\r\ninform the Assembly today that the cease-fire of\r\n12 May 1994, which was mediated by the Russian\r\nFederation, is in general being maintained. But what is\r\nmore gratifying and encouraging is that, through direct\r\nand immediate contacts between the parties to the\r\nconflict, the de facto 12 May cease-fire was formalized\r\non 27 July 1994, and on 28 August 1994 the parties\r\nreaffirmed their commitment to the cease-fire until such\r\ntime as a political document has been signed.\r\nArmenia congratulates the main parties to the\r\nconflict for their commitment to maintain the cease-fire\r\nand to engage in direct dialogue. Armenia views this as\r\nan important confidence-building measure, as a major step\r\ntowards the consolidation of the cease-fire and as a sign\r\nof a strong commitment to the successful conclusion of\r\nthe current negotiations, which in turn will make possible\r\nthe solution of the problem at the Minsk Conference of\r\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\r\nClearly, the conflict has entered a new phase, in\r\nwhich the parties have demonstrated their desire for\r\npeace.\r\nOur new challenge, and the priority for Armenia, is\r\nthe consolidation of the cease-fire and the establishment\r\nof peace. There is a historic opportunity today to end the\r\nconflict. But the cause of peace requires the active,\r\nunified support of the international community to\r\nconsolidate the cease-fire. The cumulative impact of the\r\ndistrust of the past five years, on the one hand, and the\r\nlack of international measures to support consolidation,\r\non the other hand, may increase the current uncertainty\r\nand threaten the fragile cease-fire.\r\nThere is no doubt that, beyond the cessation of\r\nhostilities, a lasting peace will mostly depend on the\r\nability of the main parties to the conflict and of the\r\ninternational community to develop innovative and\r\ninternationally approved mechanisms for its establishment\r\nand maintenance.\r\nThe primary concern for Armenia has been, and\r\nremains, the security of the people of Nagorny Karabakh.\r\nBoth Armenia and Nagorny Karabakh have repeatedly\r\nexpressed their readiness to comply with the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. A lasting peace can be\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nachieved only by ensuring the irreversibility of the peace\r\nprocess through the deployment of international security\r\nforces between Azerbaijan and Nagorny Karabakh until\r\nsuch time as a negotiated solution to the problem of\r\nNagorny Karabakh has been reached, with the full\r\nparticipation of Nagorny Karabakh at the CSCE Minsk\r\nConference.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is in\r\ndirect contradiction of the peacemaking efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations. Armenia considers that only the\r\nunconditional and indefinite extension of the Nuclear\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty will ensure that the Treaty serves\r\nits purpose. It is encouraging that negotiations on a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty have made important\r\nprogress over the past year, and we hope that a text\r\nsatisfactory to all can be agreed on soon.\r\nWe support the integration of multilateral disarmament\r\nwith United Nations activities relat to preventive diplomacy,\r\npeacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict\r\npeace-building.\r\nThe debate in the General Assembly Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council has\r\nbeen very useful. Virtually all States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations favour an increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council to reflect the radical changes in the world\r\nand the increase in the Organization’s overall membership.\r\nHowever, an increase in membership should not diminish\r\nthe Council’s efficiency. It is necessary here to note that\r\nthe Council has taken a number of constructive steps to\r\nimprove its transparency and its communication with\r\nnon-members. The Security Council should also be better\r\nable to respond to emerging threats and disputes before\r\nthey escalate into armed conflict. With improved\r\ncoordination of United Nations organizations and agencies\r\ndevoted to economic and social progress, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council could better assist the Security Council and\r\nadvise it of potential emergencies arising out of economic\r\nand social conditions. Therefore, Armenia fully supports\r\nthe call for restructuring of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and for the possible establishment of an economic\r\nsecurity council.\r\nImproving the administrative performance of the\r\nUnited Nations is another priority. Armenia welcomes the\r\ncurrent initiatives to streamline the Organization’s\r\nadministrative and management structures and procedures\r\nto meet the demands now being made of the United\r\nNations. In particular, we supported the United States\r\ninitiative, and we are pleased that the General Assembly\r\nhas created the Office of Internal Oversight Services.\r\nLet me return for a moment to the theme I began\r\nwith. In this period of unprecedented change, many\r\nhardships - both expected and unforeseen - have arisen.\r\nThe present era, full of challenge and hope, gives us new\r\nfaith in the United Nations as the best and most\r\nappropriate forum for integrating all the interests of the\r\nvarious peoples of the world, which are too fragmented\r\ntoday. Universal harmony can be established only when\r\ndiscords are peacefully resolved and full cooperation\r\nbetween nations is achieved. The United Nations,\r\nstrengthened by the noble principles and objectives\r\nenshrined in its Charter, and facing new responsibilities\r\nand tasks, can and must lead the way to a better\r\norganized and more harmonious world.\r\nLet me conclude by wishing the General Assembly\r\nevery success in the demanding work it faces during this\r\nsession.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Armenia for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Levon Ter-Petrossian, President of the Republic\r\nof Armenia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Franjo Tudjman, President of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by Mr. Franjo\r\nTudjman, President of the Republic of Croatia.\r\nPresident Franco Tudjman, President of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia, His Excellency Mr. Franjo Tudjman,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Tudjman (Croatia) (spoke in Croatian;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): It is my\r\nparticular privilege and pleasure to address the General\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nAssembly of the United Nations at the beginning of its\r\nforty-ninth session.\r\nI believe we all agree that the appearance of any\r\nstatesman before the General Assembly is a great moment\r\nfor moral and political reconsideration of one’s own\r\nreflections and responsibilities towards the international\r\npublic. This applies equally to the representatives of the\r\nesteemed founder States and to us who represent young\r\ndemocracies. This is an opportunity to present our views\r\non the problems affecting our countries, but also on all\r\nother issues of importance for the global Organization.\r\nThis is also an opportunity to compare, with the utmost\r\nseriousness, the lofty ideals incorporated in the United\r\nNations Charter with the difficulties and intricacies of daily\r\nachieving political agreement for their realization.\r\nThe noble fundamental principles of the United\r\nNations governing the rights and obligations of individuals,\r\nnations and States generally agree with the basic principles\r\nunderlying all world religions and philosophies, as well as\r\nthe fundamental laws of individual States. Yet we are still\r\npainstakingly seeking a consensus on a new and just\r\ninternational order that would unite and harmonize the lofty\r\ngoals of the United Nations Charter and the humanistic\r\nWeltänschauung with the visions of the new global order\r\nand with the specific ideals and interests of individual\r\nStates. Unfortunately, many countries, such as my own,\r\nCroatia, which labours under difficulties owing to the\r\ndisintegration of one regional international order and the\r\nestablishment of another new order, are paying the highest\r\nhuman, material and political price for the imperfection of\r\nthe world in which we live.\r\nIn addressing the General Assembly as Head of the\r\nCroatian State and the highest representative of the Croatian\r\npeople, I can note with satisfaction that the international\r\nposition of Croatia has been strengthened and furthered in\r\nspite of all the problems affecting the actions of the\r\ninternational community. In only a few years since its\r\nindependence and international recognition, Croatia has\r\nbecome a fully fledged and equal international citizen,\r\nhaving reinforced its position in the international\r\ncommunity and expanded its network of bilateral relations\r\nwith almost all States and international agencies.\r\nMoreover, Croatia has become a key factor in the\r\nestablishment of the new regional order in South-eastern\r\nEurope and a recognized and important partner of the\r\nsuper-Powers and of the international community as a\r\nwhole in the resolution of the intricate crisis, currently the\r\nmost severe international crisis in this part of the world, in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe adverse experience of the Croatian people\r\nthroughout their history, and particularly over the past few\r\nyears of the renewal of Croatian statehood, has taught us\r\nthat no sublime principle recorded in the United Nations\r\nCharter and in international law is automatically\r\nattainable - even less is it guaranteed - if the people\r\nconcerned are not determined to attain it; if they are not\r\nprepared to offer to make a high degree of sacrifice in the\r\nachievement of their right to life and freedom; and if they\r\ndo not succeed, by virtue of their strength and decisions,\r\nin bringing their national interests into line with the\r\nessential interests of the international community.\r\nDespite the inalienable right of the Croatian people -\r\none of the oldest European peoples - to self--\r\ndetermination and to the renewal of their own State,\r\ndespite the blatant barbaric aggression aimed at territorial\r\nconquest, the genocidal expulsion of the population and\r\nthe destruction of the most precious cultural heritage of\r\nthe Croatian people, such as Vukovar and Dubrovnik, the\r\nCroats would never have won the right to\r\nself-determination, to their State, to freedom and\r\nindependence, had they not been prepared to make human\r\nand material sacrifices, had they not shown a firm\r\nnation-building will, with which they have resolutely\r\nasserted themselves as a member of the international\r\ncommunity, while manifesting their readiness to be a\r\nconstructive force in the development of the new\r\ninternational order to replace the unviable and failed old\r\nsystem.\r\nIt is the duty of all of us - and especially of this, the\r\nhighest global authority - to take more determined and\r\nmore effective steps in the quest for means to break this\r\nvicious circle of suffering by individuals and peoples\r\nwrought by war. As the highest representatives of our\r\nStates and peoples, we are morally and politically obliged\r\nto create an international order, with appropriate\r\nmechanisms, capable of efficiently defending the rights of\r\neach nation or group, and especially of small and young\r\nStates. What we need are such mechanisms of the\r\nhighest global Organization that can resolutely prevent or\r\npunish any violation of the fundamental principles of\r\ninternational law.\r\nObviously, this also implies safeguarding the\r\nachievement of such rights and of generally accepted\r\nprinciples in a democratic way, so that each and every\r\nright does not have to be won the hardest way, with the\r\nblood of innocent lives, because such a way burdens the\r\ncollective memory with covert hatreds, bias and\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nvengefulness, stirring up new divisions and even more\r\ndestructive internal and regional crises.\r\nThis applies to crises in the areas of the former\r\nYugoslavia, just as it does to those in Rwanda, Somalia, the\r\nCaucasus, the Middle East, South Asia, Africa or America.\r\nIt is precisely the crisis in the former Yugoslavia that has\r\nshown the immense evil that can be done by petty political\r\nexploitation of historical myths about collective guilt or\r\nhistorical injustice, about a conspiracy of the whole world\r\nagainst a single people, and by the emphasizing of the\r\nmessianic role of a people to justify their conquest-minded\r\npolicy, causing a great deal of harm not only to those\r\nthreatened by such imperialistic policies, but also to the\r\npeople themselves, who fall victim to their own fallacies\r\nand motives, which are unacceptable and detrimental to the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAfter the collapse of the bloc division of the world\r\nand the disintegration of many multinational States, we are\r\nfaced with the task of building a new international order.\r\nAll past experience suggests that the task is very difficult.\r\nTo be successful, we need first and foremost a mechanism\r\nfor diplomatic and political negotiation, for building\r\nconfidence and for patiently overcoming real problems\r\nstemming from objectively differing interests. In cases\r\nwhere political efforts are obviously futile, the United\r\nNations must have a more efficient mechanism to achieve\r\nand even impose solutions serving the interests of\r\ninternational peace and stability. However, for reasons of\r\nrealpolitik and of the balance of interests and forces, in\r\nneither case should this contradict the fundamental\r\nprinciples of this Organization. It should be borne in mind\r\nthat the mechanism for establishing and defending the new\r\ninternational order should not merely serve the coordination\r\nof the interests of the super-Powers, but must reflect their\r\nhighest responsibility in dealing with regional crises, while\r\nbeing designed and structured to strengthen the security and\r\nprogress of small or jeopardized members of the\r\ninternational community, which account for the greater part\r\nof mankind. The United Nations must be qualified to\r\nguarantee, within the international order, equal conditions\r\nin terms of freedom, progress and equality for all the\r\nmembers of the international community.\r\nThe collapse of communism and of the bipolar\r\ndivision of the world has increased hopes for a world of\r\ngreater justice and security for all. However, we must be\r\naware of the fact that the collapse of the communist bloc\r\nand of multinational States has inevitably produced\r\ntemporarily destabilizing effects in the international order.\r\nIn this context, it should be noted that the proclamation of\r\nsovereign national States has mainly created positive\r\nconditions for the new international order, although in\r\nsome cases, where nationalism has degenerated into\r\nchauvinist-extremist trends, or even into conquest-minded\r\naggression, the effect has been negative. However, the\r\nessential point of these historical vicissitudes is the\r\nawareness of the fact that the endeavour of small peoples\r\nto attain statehood - meaning their political, cultural and\r\neconomic identity and their personality within the\r\ninternational order - has made the greatest contribution to\r\nthe collapse of communist totalitarianism and to the\r\ndemocratization of many countries. The full\r\ndemocratization of international relations is not possible\r\nwithout such democratization of internal political systems.\r\nThe security of new small States has become today\r\nthe key to stability in every region and it should provide\r\nthe groundwork for new collective security systems.\r\nOnly their complete security and equality can make them\r\nequal factors of civilizational and functional integration in\r\nspecific areas and within the global order as a whole.\r\nThe peoples of small countries will eagerly accept\r\ncivilizational integration if it is not to the detriment of the\r\nindividual quality of their State, culture and economy.\r\nOnly such safeguarding of national individuality within\r\ncivilizational integration can produce sound foundations\r\nfor functional multilateralism in the new international\r\norder. Otherwise, the myths and prejudices of the past\r\nwill continue to provide grounds for new conflicts and\r\neven clashes between civilizations. The disturbing scale\r\nwhich differences between civilizations can assume is\r\nclearly manifested in the former Yugoslavia, where local\r\naggression threatens to expand even into a conflict\r\ninvolving three civilizational religious blocs unless the\r\ncrisis, the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is resolutely\r\nbrought to an end. Croatia has always supported a\r\npolitical solution by accepting the normalization of\r\nrelations with all neighbours, even those of whose\r\naggression we were victims, in order not only to create,\r\non an equal footing, the prerequisites for a new\r\ninternational order but also to bring about a productive\r\nblending of the different civilizations facing one another\r\nin this part of the world.\r\nIn view of the current state of affairs worldwide, we\r\nsupport a thorough organizational reform of the United\r\nNations in order to improve both its responsibility and its\r\nefficiency in dealing with the pressing problems of\r\nhumankind. Problems such as uneven development,\r\npopulation growth, the ecological balance of the planet,\r\nhuman and collective rights, functional global integration,\r\nand particularly crisis points and military hot spots, call\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nfor a more effective organization of the highest\r\ninternational agency. We need an Organization which\r\ncould have a more efficient bearing on establishing equal\r\nstandards and obligations for all countries, and which would\r\nbe entitled, in crises or on key issues affecting the\r\ndevelopment of humankind and life on our planet, \"to\r\nencroach\", on behalf of the global community, upon\r\ninternal affairs of States. The international community\r\nshould have, within the United Nations, multilateral\r\nmechanisms capable of dealing more efficiently with\r\npressing crises, and developmental, environmental and\r\ntechnological challenges now facing humankind.\r\nIn this context careful consideration is required of the\r\nrole of the General Assembly. Its activity must be credible,\r\nbut it nevertheless cannot assume the role of a global\r\nparliament to the detriment of the sovereignty of Member\r\nStates. Experience suggests that a clearer division of\r\nresponsibility among the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council is required.\r\nRegional conflicts have become the chief problem now\r\nconfronting the international community - not only because\r\nof the threat posed to international peace but also because\r\nthey can cause terrible human disasters such as those in\r\nRwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Somalia.\r\nAnd, of course, they also block regional developmental\r\nprocesses, and result in scarcely reparable ecological\r\ndamage and destruction of the natural and cultural heritage\r\nof entire areas.\r\nSuch a state of affairs requires first a reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe new global order can no longer be based only on\r\nthe coalition of the victors in the Second World War, or on\r\nthe nuclear club of the great Powers. It must reflect new\r\ndemocratic, economic and regional realities which\r\nnecessarily lead to permanent Security Council membership\r\nand enhanced regional responsibility for countries such as\r\nGermany or Japan, and also some regional representatives\r\nof the so-called third world. On the other hand, the reform\r\nof the Security Council ought to avoid solutions which\r\nwould, because of the increased number of members, make\r\ndecision-making more difficult and the Council inefficient.\r\nThe efficiency and credibility of the Security Council\r\nshould be substantially strengthened in order to resolve the\r\nmain problems related to international security, especially\r\nin conflicts causing military conflagration, first of all by\r\nreducing the gap between the content of the enacted\r\nresolutions and the possibility of their enforcement. All\r\nStates of the world, and particularly the great Powers which\r\nhave an enhanced responsibility within such a system,\r\nshould in good faith make adequate economic and\r\nmilitary instruments continuously available to the Security\r\nCouncil so that its decisions can be implemented. The\r\npeacemaking mediation of the global Organization must\r\nevolve from a static freezing of the conflict and curbing\r\nits expansion, into a mechanism capable of preventing the\r\ndevelopment of the crisis in a timely manner and of\r\neliminating the consequences that are already present.\r\nIn some cases the very decisions of the Security\r\nCouncil will suffice to stop and resolve the crisis, but\r\nsometimes a demonstration of firmness will be required.\r\nThe international community must develop more\r\nsystematic mechanisms to punish those States that do not\r\naccept or that violate Security Council decisions. The\r\nenforcement of international political or economic\r\nisolation of the aggressor, with concurrent compensation\r\nfor neighbouring States which are indirect victims of such\r\nisolation, should be made even more effective. Sanctions\r\nare becoming an instrument used at an ever increasing\r\nrate when there is no political consensus, or will to resort\r\nto more energetic means, but they can produce the wanted\r\neffect only if implemented consistently within the scope\r\nof systematic pressure.\r\nThe democratization of the international order entails\r\na greater focus on the protection of human rights,\r\nincluding also punishment for violations of humanitarian\r\nlaw and the law of war. Croatia has endorsed the\r\nestablishment of the War Crimes Tribunal in the area of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia. Croatia likewise supports the\r\nestablishment of a permanent international institution\r\nwhich would deal with the most severe violations of\r\nhumanitarian law, whether in Rwanda, Somalia, Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, Croatia or Haiti. However, the\r\ninternational community should also devise ways and\r\nmeans to prosecute the perpetrators of crimes from those\r\naggressor countries which refuse to cooperate with the\r\nTribunal.\r\nCroatia proposes the provision of a permanent peace-\r\nkeeping task force for the intervention requirements of the\r\nSecurity Council, involving special military units made\r\navailable, through agreement with a specific number of\r\ncountries for Security Council requirements. We believe\r\nthat this could forestall the flaring up of many regional\r\ncrises, or contribute to their rapid prevention. Such\r\ninternational forces should have a broader mandate in\r\nterms of the use of force, not only for their own\r\nprotection but also for the energetic implementation of all\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nSecurity Council resolutions - from humanitarian\r\nobjectives to disarmament and demilitarization. The peace-\r\nkeeping force should be set up so that the national\r\ncontingents within it implement the decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council and not the specific policies of their\r\ncountries.\r\nThe proliferation of regional crises confronts the\r\nUnited Nations with ever-increasing tasks which the\r\nSecurity Council cannot fulfil successfully with its limited\r\nresources. This suggests the need for the Security Council\r\nto assign the implementation of its decisions to regional\r\norganizations as well. This in turn requires the redefinition\r\nand strengthening of the role of regional organizations\r\nwithin the collective security system. Each crisis point\r\nshould be dealt with by appreciating all specific features\r\nand by realistically evaluating the possible scope of regional\r\nsystems in the implementation of Security Council\r\ndecisions.\r\nThe solutions at which we aim in the regional crisis\r\naffecting the area of the former Yugoslavia, as well as\r\nelsewhere, must proceed from the fundamental tenets of\r\ninternational law in order to arrive at a just and lasting\r\nsolution which, in order to be acceptable, also implies\r\ncompromise in terms of detail, but not in terms of the\r\nessential issues.\r\nCroatia is very encouraged by the increasingly\r\nsuccessful peace developments in the Middle East, which\r\ndemonstrate the patience and wisdom of both the Israeli\r\nand the Arab sides. We firmly believe that similar positive\r\nendeavours are also possible in South-Eastern Europe and\r\nthe Balkans if they win the necessary united support and\r\ndetermination of the great Powers.\r\nCroatia welcomes the peaceful transfer of power to the\r\nmajority people in South Africa after decades of internal\r\nand regional instability. South Africa is the best proof that\r\nthere is no alternative to the equality of all citizens of a\r\nState.\r\nWe also welcome the involvement of the international\r\ncommunity in Rwanda, which, although it has not,\r\nunfortunately, prevented a human disaster on a scale\r\nbeyond description, has at least stopped the spiral of death\r\nand lawlessness. We continue to support the current efforts\r\nto stabilize Rwanda and to prevent the revival and\r\nexpansion of the conflict.\r\nThe agreement of the international community to\r\nfinally stop the agony of Haiti and establish a democratic\r\norder there is also encouraging. We similarly welcome\r\nthe successful processes of democratization and\r\nstabilization throughout Latin and Central America. We\r\nhave been following attentively the development of\r\nfunctional regional integration in North America, and the\r\nstronger integration trends in Europe, differences\r\nnotwithstanding, as well as the rapprochement between\r\nthe two largest countries in the European and Asian\r\nregions: Russia and China. We also welcome the\r\nconstructive role of Japan in the Pacific area and the Far\r\nEast.\r\nWithin the scope of such global developments, with\r\nthe major world Powers aiming not at reciprocal\r\ndestruction but at positive competition and cooperation,\r\nCroatia, as a small country, sees its place, first of all, in\r\nWest European civilization and in its economic and\r\nsecurity system in order to have a guarantee for its\r\nindependence, security and progress. Croatia sees its\r\nwelfare and stability in the achievement of full\r\nmembership in European integrative organizations.\r\nCroatia is prepared to responsibly assume its share of the\r\nburden in the development of the new international order\r\nand to constitute a strong link in the integration chain of\r\na new Europe.\r\nIn the very short time since it gained independence,\r\nCroatia has become a mature and responsible member of\r\nthe international community. It is already a pillar of\r\nfuture stability and cooperation in that part of\r\nsouthwestern Europe which is linked to the traditionally\r\nagitated Balkans. Croatia has in good faith accepted\r\ninternational mediation and United Nations peace-keeping\r\nforces in its territory in order to stop the war and reach a\r\npolitical solution that will simultaneously safeguard its\r\nterritorial integrity and the rights of national minorities\r\nwithin its borders. Croatia has accepted the\r\nwell-intentioned advice given it concerning the\r\nconstitutional position of the Serbian ethnic community in\r\nline with the highest standards of international\r\nconventions on the rights of national minorities, and has\r\nincorporated them into its constitutional law.\r\nCroatia has borne the heaviest brunt of the Bosnian\r\ncrisis and of the human catastrophe wrought by war in\r\nthat country. Croatia has provided a home or provisional\r\naccommodation to hundreds of thousands of refugees\r\nfrom Bosnia and Herzegovina. We sustained this effort\r\neven during the Croatian-Muslim conflicts that occurred\r\nas a result of Serbian aggression, as the victims of that\r\naggression sought space for their survival. We have\r\nprompted proposals on a mutual agreement on a\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nfederation between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, and their confederal alliance with Croatia,\r\nwhich eventually resulted in the signing of the Washington\r\nAgreements. We have spared no effort to end the senseless\r\nwar and renew cooperation between the Muslims and the\r\nCroats, who, owing to the indecision of the international\r\ncommunity, have been brought to the point of a desperate\r\nfight for the remnants of Bosnian living space left after the\r\nbarbarous Serbian aggression.\r\nIn circumstances affected by its intricate ethnic and\r\nhistorical heritage, Croatia has shown the highest degree of\r\ncooperation in the search for a peaceful political solution to\r\nthe crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia, believing,\r\nin spite of all of its negative experiences, in the final\r\nvictory of the principles of international law and in the\r\nnecessity to normalize relations between the newly emerged\r\nStates.\r\nHowever, this readiness to cooperate and this patience\r\nhave certain limits. Split into two parts by the occupation\r\nof one-fourth of its territory, threatened continuously by\r\noutlaw terrorism, burdened by the social pressure posed by\r\ndisplaced persons and the war-exhausted economy, Croatia\r\ncannot endlessly agree to fruitless compromise, because the\r\ncontinuation of the crisis threatens the existence of the State\r\nand the lives of its citizens, and prevents the reconstruction\r\nof the economy destroyed by war. We believe that it\r\nwould also be in the interest of the international community\r\nto give Croatia more determined and more consistent\r\nassistance so that it can successfully play its constructive\r\npart in the solution of the crisis.\r\nCroatia already is, and wants to remain, a mainstay of\r\nthe new international order and a bridge of cooperation\r\nbetween the newly emerged States on the basis of mutual\r\nrecognition. The indecision and aimless manoeuvring of\r\nthe international community in circumstances distinguished\r\nby the presence of militancy in certain circles of the parties\r\nin conflict threaten to push Croatia into a new military\r\nconflict which could be even worse than the previous one\r\nin terms of scope, depth and consequences. The\r\ninternational community should not leave Croatia without\r\na choice, in a position where it would be forced to resort on\r\nits own to all means necessary to defend its sovereignty,\r\nterritorial integrity and the right of its citizens - displaced\r\npersons - to return to the occupied areas.\r\nWe have always been aware that no crisis, particularly\r\none as intricate as this, can be solved without consensus by\r\nthe international community without a division of\r\nresponsibility and an agreed approach of the great Powers.\r\nAccordingly, we are the first, as with previous peace\r\nendeavours, to welcome the efforts of the Contact Group\r\nto find an acceptable solution.\r\nCroatia is prepared to continue its high degree of\r\ncooperation and partnership with the international\r\ncommunity if solutions for Bosnia and Herzegovina and\r\nfor the occupied Croatian areas are not sought at its\r\nexpense. Both crises - the one in Croatia and the other in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina - have the same source: Serbian\r\naggression. Because of this, and in view of the\r\nincreasingly stronger cooperation between Croatia and\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, a package solution should be\r\nsought. Since the sanctions imposed by the international\r\ncommunity have forced Belgrade to accept the proposal\r\nto end the war and the isolation of the Bosnian Serbs,\r\nwho oppose it, Belgrade should also be made to desist\r\nfrom supporting the Croatian Serbs, who refuse to agree\r\nto the reintegration of occupied Croatian areas and\r\nbrazenly oppose the implementation of all Security\r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nIn terms of its actual consequences, the 1991 arms\r\nembargo was aimed first and foremost at the victims of\r\nSerbian aggression. It was accepted at a time when those\r\nwho formulated global policy mistakenly deceived\r\nthemselves into thinking that that policy could save\r\nYugoslavia, failing to see that the post-Tito crisis had\r\ndeveloped because of the attempt to impose Serbian\r\nhegemony over all non-Serbian peoples in that artificial\r\nand Communist State formation. Our conditional restraint\r\nwith regard to the lifting of the embargo is motivated at\r\npresent exclusively by an endeavour focused on\r\nachieving, after all, a peaceful solution over the next few\r\nweeks or months. Croatia does not want to be drawn into\r\na new war against its will, but it will be forced to accept\r\nit, in cooperation with the other victims of Serbian\r\naggression, if the international community fails to achieve\r\na peaceful solution that would not only put an end to the\r\nwar in Bosnia and Herzegovina but also bring about the\r\nreintegration of occupied Croatian areas.\r\nCroatia welcomes Belgrade’s announced readiness to\r\nisolate the Bosnian Serbs, with their suicidal war option,\r\nbut expects Belgrade to do the same with regard to the\r\ninsurgent Serbs in Croatia. Croatia demands that the\r\nlifting of sanctions against Serbia (Yugoslavia) be linked\r\nalso to the cessation of the occupation of Croatian areas,\r\nthat is, to their reintegration into Croatia’s constitutional\r\nand legal system. Moreover, the lifting of sanctions can\r\nbe considered only after we have seen whether the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nannounced isolation is truly enforced and after this has been\r\nverified by credible control mechanisms.\r\nIn order to promote positive trends, we also\r\nunderstand up to a point the partial symbolic suspension of\r\nsanctions in order to encourage in Serbia those currently\r\nexpressing their commitment to peace. Nevertheless,\r\nCroatia will continue to insist that the lifting of certain\r\nsanctions against Belgrade, particularly those related to its\r\nbeing fully released from international economic and all\r\nother isolation, be linked to the solution of the problem of\r\nthe occupied Croatian areas.\r\nCroatia has shown a great deal of patience in its\r\ndialogue with insurgent Serbs, but now, after three years of\r\noccupation, it demands from the international community a\r\nredefinition of the UNPROFOR mandate that will provide\r\nfor the implementation of Security Council resolutions 769\r\n(1992) and 871 (1993), and force the Croatian Serbs to\r\naccept gradual normalization and reintegration pursuant to\r\nthe adopted peace plan.\r\nWe realize that both sides, after any conflict, have to\r\ninvest much time and effort into restoring and strengthening\r\nmutual confidence. We are also quite aware that no\r\nlong-term stability and progress is possible in Croatia\r\nwithout guaranteed human and ethnic rights to the Serbian\r\nand other minority groups. We have indeed guaranteed\r\nsuch rights by a special constitutional law enacted three\r\nyears ago, but we urge the international community to\r\ncreate conditions for the implementation of this law in\r\naccordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nWe have also recently taken the decision to speed up the\r\nestablishment of the human rights tribunal, and are prepared\r\nto accept international supervision of compliance with\r\nhuman and ethnic rights. However, the leaders of the\r\nSerbian insurgents, and their patrons in Belgrade, should\r\nforget their idea of a Greater Serbia and accept the\r\nreintegration of occupied Croatian areas on such\r\nfoundations, to their own benefit and to the benefit of the\r\nentire community. We are prepared to accept gradual\r\nreintegration through the opening of communications, the\r\nreturn of populations, the reconstruction of destroyed towns\r\nand villages, and provisions for social welfare and legal\r\nprotection. The democratic Government of Croatia is\r\nprepared - while urging the resolution of the fundamental\r\npolitical issue: the restoration of the sovereignty of the\r\nCroatian State over occupied areas - to genuinely comply\r\nwith all guarantees related to the rights of the Serbian\r\nethnic community.\r\nIn keeping with its peaceful policy, Croatia is also\r\nprepared to normalize relations between Belgrade and\r\nZagreb. To this end we shall accept any meeting leading\r\nto the recognition of the Republic of Croatia by Belgrade,\r\nwithin its internationally recognized borders, which would\r\nmake the message to the insurgent Serbs regarding the\r\nnecessity of gradual reintegration quite unambiguous.\r\nFor this reason we have also raised the problem\r\nregarding the parts of the Republic of Croatia occupied by\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia before the General\r\nAssembly, because there is indisputable evidence as to the\r\ncomprehensive integration - in military, judicial, customs\r\nand monetary terms - of occupied Croatian areas into the\r\neconomic and legal system of Serbia, or the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. We would like to thank the vast\r\nmajority of States in the General Assembly that have\r\nalready given us their support in this matter. If Belgrade\r\nshould express its readiness to recognize the Croatian\r\nState in the meantime, and to genuinely support\r\nreintegration and normalization, we would be pleased to\r\nspare the General Assembly the task of dealing with this\r\nproblem any further.\r\nWe would also like to thank the General Assembly\r\nfor its support for the post-war rebuilding of Croatia, and\r\nwe expect members’ continued understanding in this\r\nmatter.\r\nIn particular, we would like to emphasize that any\r\nnormalization of relations - diplomatic, political or\r\neconomic - on equal footing between the Republic of\r\nCroatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will not\r\naffect partnership and cooperation between the Croats and\r\nthe Muslims in the realization of the Washington\r\nAgreements on the Croat-Muslim Federation in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, and its confederation with Croatia.\r\nNo peace in the Balkans is possible without the\r\nestablishment of a balance of forces, nor does the future\r\nof any people lie in endless reciprocal military exhaustion\r\nor in blocking development throughout the region. We\r\ntherefore genuinely endorse the normalization of\r\nCroat-Serbian relations, but also the implementation of\r\nthe Washington Agreements, which are in our view not\r\nonly a tactical manoeuvre by the victims of Serbian\r\naggression but also a development creating the\r\npreconditions for ensuring full equality to the Croats as a\r\nnumerically smaller constituent people in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. We see in this a pledge of future regional\r\nstability and balance of forces. The confederal link\r\nbetween the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nthe Republic of Croatia provides the foundations for\r\nsustaining the sound political and economic relations\r\nsuggested by history, the geographical link and geopolitical\r\nrealities. By agreeing to a confederal relationship, Croatia\r\nis also prepared, with the assistance of primarily Western\r\ncountries, to assume its share of the responsibility for\r\ncurbing the smoldering, extreme national and religious\r\ntrends on all sides, the spread of which could jeopardize\r\nstability not only in this part of South-Eastern Europe but\r\nalso in the greater area.\r\nCroatia also attaches importance to the strengthening\r\nand realization of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand its confederation with Croatia, the progress of which\r\ndepends both on mutual relations and on the action taken\r\nby the international community in the coming months, for\r\nthis establishes a political and economic bridge with the\r\nIslamic world. Along these lines we have already\r\nestablished close cooperation with Islamic countries\r\nfostering identical aspirations, such as Turkey, Jordan and\r\nothers.\r\nDecisive weeks and months, in which we must\r\nstruggle for a peaceful resolution to the grave crisis in the\r\narea of the former Yugoslavia, lie ahead of us. Not only\r\nthe parties in conflict, but first and foremost the principal\r\nactors of the international community, bear a huge\r\nresponsibility at this moment. This involves not only the\r\ndecision on the fate of the United Nations Protection Force\r\nmandate in Bosnia and Herzegovina but also whether the\r\nContact Group will succeed in sustaining a united\r\noperational basis for a solution or allow the situation to\r\nfounder into a new military nightmare. The efforts of the\r\ninternational community focused on building a new\r\ninternational order are now being put to the test, more\r\nstrikingly than anywhere else, on reversing the\r\nconsequences of the aggression against Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and Croatia. We can ultimately resolve this\r\ncrisis if each of us assumes his share of the responsibility.\r\nHatred must give way to happy children’s faces in\r\nreconstructed Croatian Vukovar, to the restored splendour\r\nof medieval Dubrovnik, to peaceful coexistence in long--\r\nsuffering and destroyed Sarajevo and Mostar.\r\nIn order to achieve this, we must overcome the\r\ndisastrous war and political crisis by joint efforts and by a\r\nwell-devised vision of a new international order in this part\r\nof the world, in the interest of the entire global order and\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Croatia for the important\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Franjo Tudjman, President of the Republic of\r\nCroatia, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nMr. Kingibe (Nigeria): On behalf of the Nigerian\r\ndelegation, I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session. Your election is a tribute not only to\r\nyou personally and to your great country, but to Africa as\r\na whole. As a representative of Côte d’Ivoire, a country\r\nwith which Nigeria enjoys excellent and brotherly\r\nrelations, you have our full confidence in your ability to\r\nsuccessfully discharge the responsibilities of your high\r\noffice.\r\nI wish to express our sincere appreciation to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana, for the\r\nadmirable and effective manner in which he conducted\r\nthe business of the forty-eighth session.\r\nLet me also commend our esteemed\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the\r\npurposeful manner in which he has discharged the duties\r\nof his office.\r\nMy Government heartily welcomes South Africa\r\nback to the General Assembly. For decades, the policy of\r\napartheid kept that great country from participating in the\r\nwork of the Assembly. Happily, apartheid has now been\r\nconsigned to history. We salute all those who identified\r\nwith, and contributed to, the long struggle to eradicate\r\napartheid and racism in South Africa. A special tribute\r\nmust be paid to our brothers and sisters in South Africa\r\nwho were the direct victims of that evil system and who\r\nled the struggle for its eradication.\r\nWe commend the vision and statesmanship of\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela for his effective leadership in\r\nmanaging so skilfully the transition of a once-divided\r\nsociety to a united, non-racial, democratic nation. We\r\ncommend the courage and the untiring efforts of his\r\nGovernment and the entire people of South Africa to heal\r\nthe wounds of the past and launch their country on the\r\npath of economic growth and prosperity on a foundation\r\nof justice and equity for all its citizens. We are confident\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nthat the new South Africa will contribute positively to the\r\nwork of the United Nations.\r\nIn the last few years we have witnessed rapid and\r\nprofound changes on the international scene. Not only have\r\ncomplex challenges arisen, but also new opportunities for\r\nthe United Nations to redouble its efforts and contributions\r\nto the quest for peace and security and to build a world\r\ncharacterized by cooperation and an international\r\ncommunity nurtured by a common concern for humanity.\r\nIt is a matter of serious concern that the peaceful\r\nworld expected to be ushered in by the end of the cold war\r\nhas not materialized. The world continues to face some of\r\nthe worst forms of conflict and new threats to international\r\npeace and security. Violent conflicts arising from resurgent\r\nnationalism and religious intolerance between and within\r\nStates have proliferated. The unresolved situations in\r\nRwanda, Liberia, Somalia, Afghanistan, Cambodia, parts of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia and parts of the former Soviet Union\r\nhave caused wanton loss of life and destruction to property\r\nand have given rise to humanitarian crises of immense\r\nproportions. We must find early and lasting solutions to\r\nthese conflicts, as they constitute continuing threats to\r\nregional stability and to world peace.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the United Nations, as the focal\r\npoint of international cooperation, should seek to redefine\r\nits role and establish new structures and mechanisms that\r\ncan respond effectively to the challenges of crisis\r\nmanagement and conflict resolution. The United Nations\r\nmust retain its primary responsibility for taking the lead in\r\naddressing these problems. The Secretary-General’s\r\nAgenda for Peace provides a novel and imaginative\r\nframework towards this end.\r\nIn the emerging world order Africa must not continue\r\nto remain a continent beset with crises and dependent on\r\nothers for resolution of its internal conflicts. In realization\r\nof this, the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nestablished in 1993 a Central Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Resolution and Management. However, it is\r\nevident that the OAU’s capacity to effectively mobilize the\r\nrequired financial and logistic resources for this purpose is\r\nseverely limited. There is, therefore, a necessity for the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations to\r\nencourage, through increased financial and logistic support,\r\nAfrica’s efforts at peaceful settlements of disputes through\r\nregional and other arrangements, in accordance with the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. We urge the international\r\ncommunity to contribute urgently and generously to the\r\nAfrica Peace Fund, established by the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity.\r\nThe capacity of the United Nations to respond\r\npromptly and effectively to the demands made on it for\r\npeace-keeping operations depends on the willingness of\r\nMember States to accept that there is a primary role for\r\nthe United Nations and that they be ready to contribute\r\nthe necessary resources to enable it to fulfil such a role.\r\nSince our admission 34 years ago, Nigeria has been an\r\nactive participant in global efforts at peace-keeping,\r\nconflict resolution and crisis management. Our\r\nexperience over the years has convinced us that there is\r\na clear need to re-examine and reorient the peace-keeping\r\nefforts of the United Nations. Since initiating in Liberia\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States Military\r\nObserver Group (ECOMOG), a subregional peace-keeping\r\nforce, Nigeria has become Africa’s and, indeed, the\r\nworld’s largest troop contributor to international\r\npeace-keeping operations. Even though one or two\r\nMember States may choose not to recognize its\r\ncontribution, the records at the disposal of this\r\nOrganization will clearly show Nigeria’s significant\r\ncontribution to the shared responsibility of global peace-\r\nkeeping, with its attendant sacrifices, including loss of\r\nNigerian lives.\r\nThat is why we are concerned at the incessant\r\nharassment, kidnapping and killing of peace-keeping\r\npersonnel in various theatres of conflict. As an\r\nencouragement to other countries to participate in these\r\ncostly and often dangerous operations, the United Nations\r\nmust develop a capacity of effective deterrence against\r\nsuch attacks and adopt appropriate measures to provide\r\nprompt and adequate compensation for the victims.\r\nOne of the disturbing consequences of the\r\nproliferation of conflicts is the increasing incidence of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons. It is our firm conviction\r\nthat Governments must create structures and suitable\r\nconditions which will enable peoples to live in a secure\r\nand safe environment in full enjoyment of their human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. Regrettably, Africa has\r\nthe largest number of refugees and displaced persons in\r\nthe world. This imposes additional and enormous\r\nfinancial, material and social burdens on the already\r\ndistressed economies of receiving States. We commend\r\nthe efforts of the international community in addressing\r\nthe refugee problems through the provision of\r\nhumanitarian assistance. We call on all Governments to\r\neradicate the root causes of the existence of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons and to create the appropriate conditions\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nfor facilitating their voluntary return to their various\r\ncountries.\r\nDespite the end of the cold war, nuclear weapons\r\ncontinue to pose the greatest threat to international peace\r\nand security. Consequently, the need to reduce substantially\r\nand ultimately eliminate them must remain our primary\r\ngoal. Recent reports of a rising trend of trafficking in\r\nnuclear materials represent a disturbing new dimension to\r\nnuclear proliferation which must be checked as a matter of\r\nurgency.\r\nNext year’s review and extension conference of the\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty, which has so far served the\r\ninternational community rather well, must be pursued with\r\nvigour. The review and extension of the Treaty must be\r\nconsistent with objective reality and the basic expectations\r\nof Member States.\r\nQuestions of peace and security are inextricably linked\r\nto issues of development. We therefore welcome the\r\npresentation by the Secretary-General of \"An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment\" (A/48/935), which is a fitting complement to\r\nhis earlier proposals in \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277).\r\nIn \"An Agenda for Development\", the Secretary-General\r\nhas identified five strands: peace as the foundation for\r\ndevelopment; the economy as the engine of progress; the\r\nenvironment as a basis for sustainability; justice as a pillar\r\nof society; and democracy as good governance. Nigeria\r\nwelcomes these presentations because we believe that the\r\npeople must be at the centre of all governmental activity,\r\nincluding the goals of development, peace and security.\r\nGlobal efforts in addressing the crisis of development\r\nhave, over the years, reflected a dichotomy of perception\r\nbetween the industrialized countries of the North and the\r\ndeveloping countries of the South. We must recognize that\r\ndevelopment, like peace, is indivisible. It is therefore of\r\nvital importance that the North and the South should see\r\ncooperation in development in terms of mutuality of interest\r\nand partnership. The expectation that the end of the cold\r\nwar would make more resources available for development,\r\nespecially in developing countries, has regrettably remained\r\nunfulfilled. In the circumstances, the international\r\ncommunity should initiate bold and imaginative measures\r\nto bridge the widening gap between the rich and the poor\r\nnations. Affluence in the midst of poverty provides neither\r\npeace nor security either to the rich or to the poor.\r\nAfrica continues to face grave economic difficulties,\r\nat the heart of which is the debt crisis. The perennial\r\nproblems of declining investment, capital flight and fall in\r\ncommodity prices remain. The response of the\r\ninternational community has been feeble and rather\r\ninadequate. The United Nations Programme of Action for\r\nAfrica’s Economic Recovery and Development\r\n(UNPAAERD) did not achieve its desired objectives. It\r\ndoes not appear that the New Agenda for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment in the 1990s will meet with much success\r\neither. It is therefore imperative that Africa should be\r\nenabled to make a fresh start to address these problems\r\neffectively through an imaginative solution to the debt\r\ncrisis and the diversification of its economies.\r\nFor our part, we recognize the need for credible\r\nmacro-economic policies, as well as for fundamental\r\nreforms of our political institutions and processes, and we\r\nare taking measures in this regard. However, there is a\r\nneed to evolve new mechanisms and strategies for\r\ninternational cooperation and partnership.\r\nIn the wake of the efforts made in structurally\r\nreforming our economy and the democratizion of our\r\npolitical institutions, Nigeria, like many other African\r\ncountries, has come to grips with certain realities, the\r\nramifications of which are usually misconstrued and need\r\nto be fully understood.\r\nPolitical pluralism, as a facet of democratization, is\r\nso deeply ingrained in our national way of life that over\r\nthe years we have tried to evolve appropriate democratic\r\ninstitutions and values arising from and responding to our\r\nspecific national experiences, circumstances and\r\naspirations. We remain committed to this process, which\r\nis on course, despite its difficulties and challenges.\r\nToo often the process of democratization in Nigeria\r\nand, indeed, in several other parts of Africa, has not been\r\ncorrectly presented to the international community.\r\nRecent advances in information technology and our lack\r\nof resources and capacity for information delivery have\r\nhampered our ability to objectively project developments\r\noccurring in our societies. For instance, in Nigeria, we\r\ncontinue to make impressive progress in rebuilding\r\nsustainable democratic structures and institutions. A\r\nConstitutional Conference whose members were largely\r\nelected and representing a wide spectrum of our society\r\nand diverse interests, has been working assiduously to\r\ncreate an environment conducive to mutual trust,\r\nconfidence and common purpose among our people. The\r\nobjective of the Conference is to establish appropriate\r\nmodalities, institutions and frameworks for a viable\r\ndemocratic order, by laying down the ground rules for the\r\nformation of political parties, and for conducting free and\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nfair elections at all levels of government. The\r\nConstitutional Conference will complete its work by\r\nNovember 1994. Following the progress made so far,\r\npolitical activities have already commenced and full-fledged\r\npolitical party activities leading to general elections will\r\ncommence early in the new year. The resolve and\r\ncommitment of the Nigerian people and Government to\r\ndemocracy remain firm and unshakeable in the full\r\nrealization that the task of democratization is primarily our\r\nresponsibility and is for the good of our people.\r\nThe United Nations has no doubt distinguished itself\r\nsince its inception as an indispensable forum for\r\nharmonizing the actions of nations. We are confident that\r\nit will continue to serve in the years ahead as a platform for\r\ngalvanizing and channelling our collective efforts towards\r\nlasting peace and justice. This is especially so if we look\r\ninwards with a view to revitalizing and strengthening the\r\nOrganization itself. The Government of Nigeria endorses\r\nthe view of the Secretary-General in his report \"An Agenda\r\nfor Peace\" to the effect that to meet the challenges of a new\r\nera, the United Nations must reinforce its capacity to\r\nrespond as well as to reorient its approach to issues which\r\nconfront it. We subscribe to his recommendation that\r\nMember States provide the necessary political commitment\r\nand financial resources to enable the Organization to\r\nexpand, adapt and reinvigorate its work.\r\nThe reforms undertaken by our Organization so far\r\nhave been essentially piecemeal and incremental. We have\r\nmade it clear on several occasions that the time was ripe\r\nfor a fundamental restructuring of the United Nations\r\nsystem. The present composition and the decision-making\r\nprocess of the Security Council do not adequately reflect\r\ncurrent realities brought into sharp relief since the end of\r\nthe cold war. As an instrument for multilateral cooperation,\r\nthe United Nations must be transparent, efficient and\r\ndemocratic.\r\nThe Security Council, as the most important organ of\r\nthe United Nations, should embody the global quest for\r\ndemocratization in its structure, composition and\r\ndecision-making processes. In this regard, Nigeria attaches\r\nparticular importance to the work of the Open-Ended\r\nWorking Group on the question of equitable representation\r\non and increase in the membership of the Security Council.\r\nIt is our expectation that the recommendations that will\r\nemerge will make the United Nations more responsive to\r\nthe needs of the international community. We also expect\r\nthat the criteria for permanent membership of the Council\r\nshould include such considerations as population, capacity\r\nto contribute to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, and a track record assessed over a period of time\r\nin international peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts.\r\nAll permanent members should enjoy the same status and\r\nprivileges and assume the responsibilities incumbent on\r\nmembership. No less important is the imperative of\r\nequitable geographical representation, which must include\r\npermanent membership for Africa in the Security Council.\r\nIn this connection, it is appropriate that I reconfirm\r\nNigeria’s offer to serve the international community as a\r\npermanent member of the Security Council.\r\nIn this last decade of the twentieth century, two\r\nissues have preoccupied the United Nations: the\r\npromotion of peace and security and the intensification of\r\ninternational cooperation for development. On both\r\nissues, the United Nations has responded to our collective\r\naspirations with varying degrees of success. As we\r\napproach the twenty-first century, we must dedicate\r\nourselves anew to the full realization of these core goals\r\nand objectives of our Organization so that mankind can\r\nenjoy peace, freedom and prosperity.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Ireland, His Excellency Mr. Dick\r\nSpring.\r\nMr. Spring (Ireland): I warmly congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. You take office at an\r\nhistoric moment for the United Nations on the eve of its\r\nfiftieth anniversary.\r\nThe past year has been one of progress and great\r\nhope for many peoples and States represented in this\r\nAssembly. In South Africa, the elections have given birth\r\nto a democratic, non-racial society which offers a model\r\nof tolerance and reconciliation for others on that tortured\r\ncontinent. In the Middle East, the establishment of a\r\nPalestinian administration in Gaza and Jericho paves the\r\nway for a comprehensive settlement in a region that\r\nseveral times in living memory has threatened global\r\nconfrontation. In Germany and in the Baltic States, the\r\nwithdrawal of foreign troops marks the end of the\r\ndivision of our continent and heralds a Europe free and at\r\npeace. And on my own island - the island of Ireland -\r\nthe declaration by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) of a\r\ncomplete cessation of military operations has opened the\r\nprospect of a peaceful resolution which has not existed\r\nfor a generation.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nFor many years it has been customary for Irish\r\nForeign Ministers to report to this Assembly on\r\ndevelopments in relation to the conflict in Northern Ireland.\r\nToo often they have spoken of killing and destruction, the\r\nfailure of political initiatives and controversies on human\r\nrights. It seemed that the Northern Ireland conflict\r\nbelonged to the category of truly intractable problems\r\ndestined to outlive all change of circumstance and to defy\r\nall attempts at a solution.\r\nI begin my address this year on this question, because\r\nmy message is now one of hope. The past 12 months have\r\nsignificantly enhanced the prospects for lasting peace and\r\nstability on the island of Ireland. It is true that the edifice\r\nof a solution still remains to be constructed, but I believe\r\nvery solid foundations have now been laid.\r\nMr. Abreu (Uruguay), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nAt the origin of the Northern Ireland conflict lies a\r\ndifference of view as to whether the partition of Ireland\r\nearlier this century was or was not a denial of the right of\r\nthe Irish people to self-determination. This difference was\r\npassionately and violently acted out by two communities in\r\nNorthern Ireland, who were and remain deeply polarized by\r\ntheir division on fundamental constitutional issues. This\r\nconflict has been costly for all the people of Northern\r\nIreland and for the British and Irish peoples generally. To\r\ndeal with it is one of the most urgent and important tasks\r\nfacing both Governments. Experience has shown that the\r\nability of the two Governments to do so will be directly\r\nproportionate to the degree of agreement between us.\r\nIt is in the inherited gaps between our positions that\r\nterrorism on both sides has taken root. For that reason,\r\ncooperation and agreement between the two Governments\r\nis vital for any solution. Last December, the Irish and\r\nBritish Governments published a Joint Declaration which\r\nsignificantly consolidated the common ground between us\r\nand offered all the parties to the conflict a compelling\r\npolitical alternative to the endless cycle of bloodshed and\r\nretribution.\r\nIn the Joint Declaration, the British Government\r\nrecognizes that it is for the people of Ireland alone, by\r\nagreement between the two parts respectively and without\r\nexternal impediment, to exercise their right of\r\nself-determination on the basis of consent, freely and\r\nconcurrently given, North and South, to bring about a\r\nunited Ireland if that is their wish. The Irish Government\r\naccepts that the right to self-determination of the people of\r\nIreland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with,\r\nand subject to, the agreement and consent of a majority\r\nof the people of Northern Ireland.\r\nThe Declaration seeks to deal with the issue of\r\nself-determination in a way which banishes the spectre of\r\ncoercion. Instead, political consent is now clearly set as\r\nthe necessary goal and touchstone for any stable\r\narrangement in Ireland, whatever the framework. The\r\nDeclaration makes clear that the British Government is\r\nnot the enemy of the Irish nationalist tradition and that\r\nthe Irish Government is not the enemy of the unionist\r\ntradition. A crucial aspect of the Declaration is the\r\nacknowledgement that future arrangements in Ireland are\r\nfor decision and agreement between the Irish people\r\nthemselves, North and South, and its formal commitment\r\nthat the role of the British Government will be to promote\r\nsuch agreement.\r\nThe Declaration thus marks a decisive break with\r\nany notion which has had such dark resonances in Irish\r\nhistory that arrangements in Ireland might be decided as\r\na function of British rights over Ireland. This opens the\r\nway, in turn, for a new and more developed\r\nacknowledgement by the nationalist tradition of the\r\nunquestionable rights of the unionist community, derived\r\nfrom its position as a distinct tradition in Ireland. A\r\nconsiderable section of the Joint Declaration is devoted to\r\nthis issue.\r\nAt the end of August, following a protracted internal\r\ndebate, the IRA decided in favour of a complete cessation\r\nof military operations. That decision has been confirmed\r\nby other statements in the interval. Much more\r\nimportant, it has been sustained on the ground. This is a\r\ndevelopment of very great significance.\r\nIt is first and foremost welcome because it saves\r\nlives. Secondly, it opens the prospect of comprehensive\r\nnegotiations, governed by democratic principles, taking\r\nplace against a background of peace and embracing the\r\nentire spectrum of all those involved in the conflict. Such\r\nnegotiations have the greatest potential for success.\r\nMoreover, their outcome is likely to be more authoritative\r\nthan a less general agreement, which would have had to\r\nbe enforced against a background of continuing violence\r\nand repression.\r\nWe still await the end of the campaign of violence\r\ncarried out by loyalist paramilitaries. I remain hopeful\r\nthat they, in turn, will come to realize that their violence\r\nis repugnant to their own community as well as to others,\r\nand counterproductive to their cause. We hope that\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nresponsible political leaders in the unionist community will\r\nmake their voices strongly heard on this issue, as many\r\nhave done already, and that a complete cessation of\r\nviolence will ensue on the loyalist side also.\r\nWe have now an unparalleled opportunity to create the\r\nbasis for lasting agreement among our different political\r\ntraditions in Ireland. We can do so, no longer prisoners of\r\nthe past, but rather learning form our past mistakes on all\r\nsides.\r\nPerhaps the greatest such mistake, shared at one time\r\nas an unquestioned assumption on both sides, was that this\r\nconflict, concentrated in the narrow ground of Northern\r\nIreland, could only end in victory and defeat for one\r\ntradition or the other. Compromise was seen as the first\r\nstep on the road to defeat. We have all learned, through a\r\ncostly process of trial and error, that in the Northern Ireland\r\nsituation notions of victory and defeat are an illusion. Each\r\ncommunity had the critical mass to thwart the other, but\r\nneither can prevail alone. General political consent is\r\ntherefore a simple practical necessity, as well as an ideal.\r\nThe challenge now for the British and Irish\r\nGovernments is to seize on the momentum for peace.\r\nTogether with all the political parties in Northern Ireland,\r\nwe need to build new structures, reflecting the lessons of\r\nour experience and building on the principles of the Joint\r\nDeclaration.\r\nExperience has taught us that a majority \"winner-\r\ntakes-all\" system is profoundly unsuited to a society such\r\nas Northern Ireland, where divisions are predominantly\r\ncommunal and unchanging - rather than social or economic,\r\nand therefore changeable. Let us apply that lesson, making\r\nagreement and consensus the kernel of all new\r\narrangements.\r\nNorthern Ireland is characterized by a profound lack\r\nof consensus on the constitutional issue of whether the\r\nlegitimate frame of reference is Northern Ireland or the\r\nisland as a whole. Let us anchor new arrangements in an\r\nAgreement acknowledging and reconciling the validity of\r\nboth.\r\nThe political division of Ireland has inhibited many of\r\nthe constructive political, economic and social interactions\r\nwhich can contribute to the welfare of both parts of the\r\nisland. Let us set that to rights in effective new structures\r\nbetween North and South.\r\nThe choice of sovereignty has hitherto been a kind\r\nof symbolic shorthand for the victory or defeat of one\r\ncommunity or the other. Let us divorce this notion as far\r\nas possible from all partisan or tribal connotations, and\r\nagree that the exercise of sovereignty, by whichever\r\nGovernment, will at all times, now and in the future, be\r\nqualified by scrupulously equal treatment of the two\r\nNorthern communities and of their rights, identities and\r\nallegiances.\r\nNew arrangements on these lines would, I believe,\r\ndivest the conflict over sovereignty of much of its current\r\nconfrontation and passion. Under new arrangements on\r\nthese lines, buttressed and guaranteed by formal\r\nagreement between the two Governments, conflict over\r\nthe choice of sovereignty might cease to become the\r\ndestabilizing issue it now is. Instead, it might be handled\r\nunder agreed political ground-rules, scrupulously even and\r\nfair to both aspirations, as a question of mutual\r\npersuasion and comparative benefit. Northern Ireland\r\ncould become a place specially dedicated to the protection\r\nof the rights of both communities. Then, for the first\r\ntime, both communities there could be truly themselves,\r\nand perhaps find common purpose in many areas where\r\nat present there is only division.\r\nThe Irish Government will pursue progress towards\r\na lasting accommodation on a number of different levels.\r\nWe are establishing a Forum for Peace and\r\nReconciliation, to enable all democratic parties in Ireland\r\nthat are so minded to make recommendations on ways in\r\nwhich agreement and trust between the two traditions in\r\nIreland can be promoted and established. This will not be\r\na negotiating forum, although we are hopeful that its work\r\nwill contribute positively to the climate in which\r\nnegotiations take place, and that many of its\r\nrecommendations can be translated into practice.\r\nSimultaneously, the Irish and British Governments\r\nare working on a joint framework document setting out\r\ntheir own views on where a balanced accommodation of\r\nthe problem may be found. It is our hope that this\r\ndocument, which we will commend to the other parties,\r\nbut cannot of course impose on them, will give fresh\r\nimpetus to the process of comprehensive negotiation.\r\nThe developments I have outlined have forged a\r\nunique opportunity to achieve a comprehensive, just and\r\npeaceful resolution of the Northern Ireland problem. It is\r\nvital that their potential should be realized through early\r\nnegotiations and agreement on new political structures.\r\nA new beginning for all our relationships in Ireland is\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nwithin our reach if we have the collective courage and\r\nimagination to avail ourselves of the opportunity. The\r\ndesire for a lasting peace and a political accommodation\r\nhas never been stronger across the entire population of the\r\nisland.\r\nIf in many parts of the world the message is one of\r\nhope, we know that in other places old enmities and ethnic\r\nanimosities have surfaced, with vicious and indeed deadly\r\nconsequences.\r\nThe conflicts in Somalia, in the former Yugoslavia, in\r\nRwanda; the gross abuses of human rights in Haiti and East\r\nTimor; the suffering of millions who are denied their basic\r\nrights to food, water or shelter; these remind us that we\r\ncannot let up in the struggle to create a peaceful world and\r\nto uphold human dignity.\r\nA characteristic feature of many contemporary crises\r\nis that they are essentially conflicts within States, rather\r\nthan between them.\r\nAnd this, I believe, is the central question facing the\r\nUnited Nations as it approaches its fiftieth anniversary: can\r\nthe United Nations, which was born out of the greatest\r\ninter-State conflict the world has ever seen, and which is\r\ndesigned specifically to prevent and resolve such conflicts -\r\ncan this Organization deal adequately with internal crises\r\nand civil strife?\r\nI know that there are some who argue that the United\r\nNations has no place in such matters, that many internal\r\nconflicts are not amenable to outside intervention. I can\r\nunderstand such arguments and the cautious desire not to\r\nget involved in other people’s internal quarrels.\r\nBut can we let a crisis such as that in the former\r\nYugoslavia escalate to the point where it threatens a wider\r\nBalkan conflict?\r\nCan we stand aside while millions are slaughtered by\r\ntheir compatriots in Rwanda?\r\nBy what calculus do we divine that death in civil strife\r\ncounts less than death in inter-State warfare, that those\r\nthreatened by their own countrymen are less deserving of\r\nour efforts than those who are threatened by their\r\nneighbours?\r\nI can find no moral justification for such distinctions.\r\nThe appalling escalation of terror and violence in\r\nRwanda demonstrates the truth of this. To the names that\r\nhave come to be associated in recent years with human\r\nsuffering - Sarajevo, Gorazde, Mogadishu, Baidoa - we\r\ncan now add Goma, Bukavu and Ngara.\r\nThe tragedy of Rwanda has gripped the hearts and\r\nminds of the Irish people. Today there are over 100 Irish\r\naid workers in the area. More than 70 Irish public\r\nservants and military personnel are working with the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) and the aid agencies.\r\nAnd our President, Mary Robinson, hopes shortly to\r\nvisit Rwanda to show solidarity with the people of that\r\ntroubled land and to emphasize the need for international\r\naction.\r\nIn its response to the crises in Rwanda and Somalia,\r\nthe international community has shown a generous\r\nwillingness to help. Much human suffering has been\r\nalleviated. But we have not come near to achieving\r\ndurable solutions. Nor are we any nearer to constructing\r\na system to prevent similar horrors in the future.\r\nWe must ask how the United Nations could have\r\nplayed a more active mediating role in Rwanda.\r\nCould it have prevented the outbreak of genocidal\r\nwarfare when political unrest rapidly deteriorated into\r\ncivil strife?\r\nCould it have responded more coherently when\r\ngenocide was followed by a mass exodus?\r\nHow can it now assist in the resolution of the\r\nconflict?\r\nI believe that unless we equip the United Nations to\r\ndeal with these kinds of problems - the most characteristic\r\nand pressing of our time - the credibility and relevance of\r\nour Organization will increasingly be called into question.\r\nThe roots of civil disorder and internal strife are\r\noften complex and deep - deeper and more complex,\r\nindeed, than the causes of inter-State war. Recent\r\nexperience has shown that recourse to Chapter VII action\r\nalone is inadequate and that outside involvement, unless\r\ncarefully prepared and sensitively executed, can add to,\r\nrather than diminish, the crisis. We must learn the\r\nlessons of this and realize that building a United Nations\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\ncapable of meeting the challenges of the new era will\r\nrequire coordinated action in many areas.\r\nI will mention seven points on which I believe there\r\nshould be priority action:\r\nWe must reform the Security Council to make it more\r\nrepresentative of the United Nations greatly expanded\r\nmembership and to reflect the great changes in\r\ninternational relations of the past 50 years.\r\nWe must develop the Organization’s capacity for early\r\nwarning and mediation and for timely intervention in\r\ndisputes before they escalate out of control.\r\nWe must enhance the United Nations peace-keeping\r\ncapabilities to make them more flexible and\r\nresponsive when crises erupt.\r\nWe must develop the United Nations operational\r\ncapacity in the area of human rights. In particular, we\r\nneed a more developed system of human rights\r\nmonitors.\r\nWe must act to establish a permanent international\r\ncriminal court. We must intensify our efforts to\r\neliminate the root causes of many conflicts -\r\ninequality, social injustice, and poverty - by acting on\r\nthe Secretary-General’s agenda for development.\r\nWe must restrict the international flow of the\r\ninstruments of war and oppression by adopting a code\r\nof conduct for conventional arms transfers.\r\nThere is now widespread agreement on the need for\r\nthe Security Council to be more representative and more\r\nresponsive to the needs of the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. I believe that early decisions to increase\r\nthe overall membership of the Council are needed, and that\r\nan increase in the permanent membership should reflect the\r\nchanges in international life over the past 50 years.\r\nOur discussions have shown that concrete decisions\r\nwill not be easy, but we must avoid getting bogged down\r\nin narrow considerations of optimal numbers and the\r\ncompeting claims of regional Powers. One way of handling\r\nthis would be to build into our decision a commitment to\r\nreview again the membership of the Security Council at a\r\nspecific date in the future. In this way we could work for\r\na result that reflects current geopolitical realities, that\r\nacknowledges that these realities can change over time and\r\nthat recognizes that all Member States have the potential\r\nto contribute to international peace and security.\r\nMeasures already taken to improve transparency are\r\nwelcome, but more must be done to facilitate interaction\r\nbetween the Security Council and the general\r\nmembership. And surely the time has also come when\r\nwe can delete from the Charter references to enemies that\r\nno longer exist.\r\nThe terrible crises in Rwanda and Somalia have\r\nshown that we need to look urgently and more closely at\r\nthe role and capacity of the United Nations in preventing\r\nand defusing conflicts. And we need to consider ways of\r\nstrengthening the capability of regional organizations to\r\nengage in conflict resolution. We must be prepared to\r\navail ourselves in full of the functions bestowed by the\r\nCharter on the General Assembly, the Secretary-General\r\nand the Economic and Social Council, as well as on the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe must ensure that information on economic and\r\nsocial conditions likely to result in a threat to security or\r\nstability is brought quickly to the attention of the\r\nOrganization, and in particular to the Security Council.\r\nWe have the instrument for this in the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. We should now act on the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal that a reformed Economic\r\nand Social Council provide reports to the Security\r\nCouncil on those economic and social developments that\r\nmay threaten peace and security.\r\nBeyond this, we must strengthen the United Nations\r\ncapacity for mediation. The Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, despite their undoubted authority\r\nunder the Charter, are not always the most suitable\r\ninstruments for the direct mediation of conflict. In\r\npractice, the Secretary-General has on many occasions\r\nappointed a representative to mediate in particular crises,\r\noften with considerable success. I believe that the time\r\nhas come to put these arrangements on a more organized\r\nbasis. This could be done by constituting a mediation\r\nbody to which the Security Council or the Assembly\r\ncould refer difficult issues. Acting in consultation with\r\nthe Secretary-General, this body would be distinct from\r\nthe International Court of Justice, in that it would have\r\nthe role of political mediation rather than that of\r\npronouncing a verdict in terms of international law. I\r\nbelieve that such a body, drawing on the pool of\r\npersonnel skilled in mediation, backed by effective staff\r\nand properly resourced, could rapidly acquire an expertise\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nand authority that would significantly enhance the\r\npeacemaking capabilities of the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations is now conducting more peace-\r\nkeeping operations and has more personnel in the field than\r\nat any time in its history. Ireland is participating in many\r\nof these operations and devotes a significant proportion of\r\nits defence forces, and of its defence expenditure, to United\r\nNations peace-keeping. That is one reason why my\r\nGovernment is particularly concerned at the under-funding\r\nof peace-keeping operations and at the failure of certain\r\nMember States to pay their assessed contributions.\r\nBut there is a deeper and more important reason. The\r\nSecretary-General has pointed to the difficulty in finding\r\npersonnel for the many new demands on United Nations\r\npeace-keeping. Recent experience has shown that a\r\nSecurity Council mandate no longer ensures that an\r\noperation will soon take place. I can think of nothing more\r\nserious or more damaging than the failure of the\r\nOrganization quickly to mount an operation at the outbreak\r\nof a crisis. The crisis itself escalates out of control, the\r\ncredibility of the United Nations is called into question and\r\nthe authority of the Security Council is undermined.\r\nWe must act to ensure that operations are properly\r\nresourced, that troop contributors can take decisions on\r\nparticipation, secure in the knowledge that they will be\r\nadequately funded, and that there is greater consultation\r\nbetween the Council and troop contributions.\r\nThe cost of peacekeeping will always be less than the\r\ncost of war. There could be no better way to mark the\r\nfiftieth anniversary than to address once and for all this\r\nmost critical constraint on peacekeeping operations.\r\nAs our understanding of civil strife develops, we are\r\ncoming to see the vital role that action in the area of human\r\nrights can play in helping to prevent and resolve conflict.\r\nThe value of integrating peace-keeping and human rights\r\nhas proved its worth in Cambodia, in El Salvador and\r\nelsewhere, but our approach has been piecemeal and\r\ntentative. Even in Rwanda we still await an adequate\r\ndeployment of human rights monitors. Resources will have\r\nto be found for this activity. For its part, Ireland intends to\r\ncontribute to the voluntary fund for Rwanda established by\r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nThere is a clear need to put in place an effective\r\nsystem of monitoring and adjudicating human rights\r\nviolations. One important step would be to develop a\r\nstanding team of human rights monitors reporting to the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. This would make\r\nit easier to integrate human rights action into peace-\r\nkeeping operations, and the mandate for peace-keeping\r\noperations could include a human rights dimension with\r\nclearly established reporting and verification procedures.\r\nIn addition, we should move now on the\r\nestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.\r\nThe United Nations must demonstrate that it has the will\r\nto bring to justice those responsible for crimes against\r\nhumanity, summary executions, torture, rape and\r\nmutilation. If we fail to do this, we will have failed to\r\nlearn the lessons of Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and we will,\r\nof course, risk their repetition.\r\nOur efforts to deal with war and civil strife cannot\r\nignore what the \"Agenda for Peace\" has described as the\r\nroot causes of conflict: economic despair, social injustice\r\nand political oppression. Maintaining the peace is\r\nimpossible in an unequal world. Conversely,\r\ndevelopment is the most secure basis for peace.\r\nIt can be no coincidence that Rwanda and Somalia\r\nare among the least developed countries of the world.\r\nThus, when the Secretary-General himself tells us that\r\ndevelopment is in crisis, we are compelled to listen, and\r\nwe are compelled to agree with him that an alternative to\r\nthe United Nations in development simply does not exist.\r\nThe truth is that the agenda for development and the\r\n\"Agenda for Peace\" are complementary. They are\r\ndifferent sides of the same coin, and we must make\r\nprogress on both if we are to reach our common goals of\r\npeace and prosperity.\r\nWhat has been called a \"culture of development\"\r\nmust extend beyond the provision of financial assistance\r\nto embrace economic progress, the environment, social\r\njustice, democracy and good governance. At next year’s\r\nWorld Social Summit and at the Conference on Women\r\nwe can build on the progress already made in the\r\nConferences on Environment and on Population.\r\nThe tragedy of war and civil strife underlines the\r\nneed to address more seriously the question of\r\ndisarmament. The easy availability of arms contributes,\r\nnot just to the scale of the carnage and suffering in\r\nconflict, but to the outbreak of conflict itself.\r\nAt the global level, the volume of trade in major\r\nconventional weapons has declined in recent years. But\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nin some regions large stockpiles have accumulated. In\r\nothers the arms trade continues to grow.\r\nThere is a need for States to exercise greater\r\nresponsibility and restraint in their arms transfers. Already\r\nthe United Nations Register of Conventional Arms has led\r\nto greater transparency. But I believe that we should now\r\ngo further. That is why Ireland has proposed that the\r\nUnited Nations elaborate a code of conduct for conventional\r\narms transfers which would set out common principles to\r\nbe observed in this area. It is my hope that the General\r\nAssembly will now decide that work on such a code should\r\nbe put in hand.\r\nThe lives of millions of people have been put at risk\r\nand large areas rendered unsafe as a result of the\r\nindiscriminate use of land-mines. Since last year many\r\nGovernments have introduced moratoriums on the export of\r\nanti-personnel mines. I welcome President Clinton’s call\r\nfor an agreement to reduce the number and availability of\r\nthese mines.\r\nI welcome also the very considerable progress made\r\nin the reduction of nuclear arsenals and towards a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. The threat of nuclear\r\nconflict between the major Powers no longer overshadows\r\nour daily lives. But there is disturbing evidence that some\r\nStates still want to acquire a nuclear-weapon capability.\r\nTheir ability to do so is helped by the growth in the world’s\r\nstocks of fissile materials and in personnel with the\r\nrequisite technological skills.\r\nNext year’s Conference to review and extend the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\nprovides an opportunity to address these issues. Ireland\r\nwants to see an indefinite extension of the Treaty. We\r\nwant to see the principles on which the Treaty is founded\r\nmaintained; the non-proliferation regime strengthened; all\r\nStates becoming members; and progress made towards the\r\ncomplete elimination of nuclear weapons, as envisaged in\r\nthe Treaty.\r\nThe agenda for United Nations reform is formidable -\r\nfor the Organization itself and for the States that make up\r\nthis Assembly. But whatever the difficulties, reform is a\r\nvital and urgent necessity. I am convinced that unless we\r\nact in a broad and imaginative way, bringing together the\r\npolitical, peace-keeping, development and human-rights\r\ninstruments of the United Nations, we will prove inadequate\r\nto the great contemporary challenges.\r\nWe now have an opportunity such as has not existed\r\nfor a generation. I urge all of us to grasp it.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI call on the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak\r\nRepublic, His Excellency Mr. Eduard Kukan.\r\nMr. Kukan (Slovakia): I should like to congratulate\r\nMr. Essy of Côte d’Ivoire on his election to the post of\r\nPresident of the General Assembly of the United Nations\r\nat its forty-ninth session. I wish him much success in this\r\nhighly responsible mission.\r\nAt the same time, I should like to thank Mr. Essy’s\r\npredecessor as President, His Excellency Ambassador\r\nInsanally, for his great personal contribution to the\r\nsuccess of the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nI also avail myself of this opportunity to express\r\ndeep appreciation of all the work and effort of the\r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, as the head of the United Nations.\r\nAllow me to open my statement with a personal\r\nremark. During the past few years we have witnessed\r\ndynamic changes in world politics. The dynamism of\r\ndevelopment in international life is reflected in my\r\npersonal life. In the course of the past four years I have\r\nrepresented two States as their Ambassador to the United\r\nNations. Today I am honoured and proud to represent\r\none of them - my native country, Slovakia - as its\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs. The fact that the Permanent\r\nRepresentative to the United Nations was nominated as\r\nthe Minister of Foreign Affairs of his country is yet\r\nanother manifestation of the respect that the United\r\nNations enjoys in Slovakia.\r\nThe fact that my country, less than two years after\r\nits admission to membership of the United Nations,\r\nbecame a full-fledged component of the community of\r\nnations is confirmation of the credibility of our foreign\r\npolicy, which is based on respect for international law and\r\nfor principles of democratic coexistence among nations.\r\nIt is also a result of the implementation of our foreign-\r\npolicy principles, which originate from the hierarchy of\r\nvalues of Slovak society. These values are characterized\r\nby respect for democracy, human rights and a free-market\r\neconomy.\r\nIt is evident that Slovakia, as a small country in the\r\ngeopolitically sensitive central European region, must\r\nhave a transparent and clearly defined orientation in its\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nforeign policy. We therefore aim our activities at European\r\nintegrationist trends and strive to join the stable, democratic\r\nand prosperous countries. Joining the European Union and\r\nparticipating actively in the elaboration of an efficient\r\nmodel of European security are among the main priorities\r\nof Slovak foreign policy.\r\nOur international contacts are, of course, much wider\r\nand are of a more multilateral character. We are interested\r\nin the best possible relations with neighbouring countries.\r\nI am glad to state that we have recently managed to fulfil\r\nthis aim successfully. We believe that subregional\r\narrangements, such as Visegrad 4 or the central European\r\ninitiative, also help to strengthen the stability of the whole\r\nregion. Close contacts with western European countries -\r\nand these are being strengthened in respect of economic,\r\npolitical and security matters - also contribute to the\r\nfulfilment of this objective.\r\nAt the global level, the priority of the Slovak\r\nRepublic, which is part of the European region, is the\r\nmaintenance of solid transatlantic relations through the\r\ndevelopment of intensive cooperation with the United States\r\nof America and Canada, both bilaterally and multilaterally.\r\nFurther, we consider the development of cooperation with\r\nour eastern neighbours - Ukraine, the Russian Federation\r\nand other countries - as being especially important.\r\nRegardless of the fact that Slovakia is a small central\r\nEuropean country, we strive to maintain and further develop\r\ngood relations and cooperation with the countries of Asia,\r\nAfrica, Latin America and the Pacific region.\r\nOur tasks and goals are very demanding, and their\r\nfulfilment depends on sufficient support from the public\r\nand on the consensus of the major political parties. I am\r\nglad to state that in Slovakia there is wide public and\r\npolitical agreement on the principal issues of our foreign\r\npolicy. This is a positive signal for foreign countries,\r\nwhich can count on Slovakia as a reliable partner.\r\nAs I indicated at the beginning of my statement,\r\ntoday’s world is defined by dynamic changes that are due\r\nto the growing multipolarity of international relations.\r\nMany important events that occurred in the last year\r\nadvanced the international community towards achievement\r\nof the goals of the United Nations - to guarantee the\r\npeaceful coexistence of nations - but there have also been\r\nevents that cannot fill us with optimism.\r\nOne positive event has been the peace process in the\r\nMiddle East. Slovakia has supported this process from the\r\nvery beginning with the aim of reaching a comprehensive\r\nand final peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\r\nThe conclusion of agreements between the State of Israel\r\nand the Palestine Liberation Organization on the provision\r\nof limited autonomy in the zone of the Gaza Strip and\r\nJericho, and the Jordan-Israeli declaration on terminating\r\nthe state of war, as well as on measures to settle mutual\r\nrelations, justified once more the peace efforts of the\r\nparties involved, as well as those of the international\r\ncommunity, which is convinced that peace can be restored\r\nin this region.\r\nWe also welcome the democratization of South\r\nAfrican society demonstrated by the elections in April of\r\nthis year. Though South Africa is far from Slovakia, we\r\nput special emphasis on the continuation of this\r\ndevelopment. The visit of the President of the Slovak\r\nRepublic to South Africa for the inauguration of President\r\nMandela is evidence of this.\r\nOn the other hand, even these positive examples will\r\nnot help us in successfully ending conflicts in other parts\r\nof the world. We are deeply concerned over the\r\ncontinuing conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina that is\r\ntaking place some 300 kilometres from our borders.\r\nSlovakia is among the countries that yearn for an end to\r\nthe continuing tragedy in that country. We wish to\r\nunderline the superiority of a political solution to a\r\nmilitary one, which by definition cannot eliminate the\r\nantagonism between the opposing sides.\r\nThe Slovak Republic, as a user of nuclear energy for\r\npeaceful purposes, is a State without nuclear weapons.\r\nWe therefore support a speedy signing of the\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. We wish to emphasize\r\nthat such a treaty should apply to all tests without\r\nexception and for an indefinite period, including tests for\r\npeaceful purposes. Sustaining the moratorium on nuclear\r\ntests by all members of the nuclear club is considered by\r\nSlovakia to be the main precondition for concluding such\r\na treaty, and at the same time, it is a clear sign of the real\r\nintentions of the nuclear club members.\r\nWe consider next year’s Review Conference of the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to be closely linked to the\r\nnuclear-test ban. The NPT has been playing an important\r\nrole in the history of humanity, and has managed to stop\r\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons. We support\r\nunequivocally the unconditional and indefinite extension\r\nof the NPT.\r\nThe Slovak Republic appreciates the steps\r\nundertaken at the United Nations in the sphere of\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\ntransparency in armaments, whether conventional or\r\nchemical and biological. We welcome the first positive\r\nuniversal step regarding conventional weapons: the\r\nestablishment of the Register of Conventional Arms.\r\nThe verification level of the existing multilateral\r\ntreaties is in most cases either inadequate or incomplete.\r\nMany of the multilateral treaties on arms control do not\r\ncontain verification clauses - and if they do contain such\r\nclauses, they do not make full use of verification, as in the\r\ncase of the NPT. I believe that the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\r\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction\r\nwill be a test case for a new type of multilateral treaty on\r\ndisarmament. The ratification of this agreement is among\r\nthe top priorities in the agenda of our Parliament.\r\nI can assure the Assembly that Slovakia is fulfilling\r\nresponsibly and in a timely manner the obligations\r\nconcerning confidence building, security, control of\r\narmaments and disarmament that have been undertaken at\r\nuniversal and regional negotiating forums. We firmly\r\nsupport all disarmament activities; hence we are well aware\r\nof the important role of the Conference on Disarmament in\r\nthis field. I would like to confirm the permanent interest of\r\nthe Slovak Republic in resolving the issue of its\r\nmembership in the Conference, since the former\r\nCzechoslovak federation was a founding member of the\r\nConference. It is truly a paradox that a country in which\r\narms production decreased to 9 per cent of its 1989 level is\r\nnot yet a member of the Conference.\r\nWe are aware of the need to improve existing\r\norganizational structures and strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) as a regional\r\narrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the United\r\nNations Charter. The CSCE continues to adapt to the new\r\nrealities. Slovakia, however, is of the opinion that the basic\r\ncharacter of the CSCE should not change. It should remain\r\na wide political forum and its basic principle - the adoption\r\nof decisions by consensus - should be maintained.\r\nPeace-keeping operations are currently at a level that\r\nis perhaps the highest that the international community can\r\nprovide and sustain. They drain our financial resources,\r\nwhile not even sparing human lives. The original\r\nenthusiasm for peace-keeping operations has gradually\r\ncooled down with the knowledge that there are many\r\nobstacles that the United Nations cannot overcome. The\r\ntragic situation in Rwanda, where even the presence of\r\nUnited Nations forces could not avert a civil war and\r\nmassacres, is a clear example. The United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping operation on the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia has also encountered serious problems. The\r\nSlovak Republic has a contingent of 600 soldiers in the\r\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) -\r\nmembers of the engineering unit who among their\r\nmilitary tasks provide highly specialized expert work and\r\nassistance in restoring that country, which has suffered so\r\nmuch tribulation. Along with their efforts in the\r\nmaintenance of peace, they have undertaken the\r\ndangerous task of removing mines from the country.\r\nSlovakia strongly supports President Clinton’s appeal\r\nin his statement before the General Assembly on Monday\r\nfor the conclusion of an agreement that would reduce the\r\nnumber and availability of anti-personnel land-mines. I\r\nwould like to mention that Slovakia, in accordance with\r\nresolution 48/75 K, has already implemented, on 17 April\r\n1994, a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-\r\nmines for an indefinite period.\r\nIn connection with United Nations efforts to resolve\r\nseveral problems that have arisen in the field of peace-\r\nkeeping operations, the Slovak Republic welcomes the\r\ndecision to establish stand-by forces that can be\r\ndispatched on short notice and under the command of the\r\nUnited Nations. We have declared our interest in\r\ncontributing to these units with engineers of the Slovak\r\nArmy. Such units need highly specialized and thorough\r\npreparation and training designed for specific purposes.\r\nMy country is in the process of building such a training\r\ncentre and has already used it to train more than 1,200\r\nmembers of United Nations peace-keeping forces since\r\nMay of this year.\r\nExperience has shown that the traditional type of\r\npeace-keeping operation is no longer sufficient. If a\r\npeace-keeping operation is to succeed it should contain a\r\nhumanitarian element. Slovakia is of the opinion that in\r\nany operation under United Nations auspices and with\r\nUnited Nations coordination it is necessary to respect the\r\nprinciple of the priority of United Nations command.\r\nIn connection with the increased number of attacks\r\nagainst United Nations personnel, the Slovak Republic\r\nappreciates the Assembly’s decision at its forty-eighth\r\nsession to elaborate an international convention dealing\r\nwith the safety and security of United Nations and\r\nassociated personnel. The next step the United Nations\r\nshould consider is providing proper armament and other\r\nmatériel for members of peace-keeping missions so that\r\nthey might be able to react more appropriately to\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nchanging conditions and if necessary be able to defend\r\nthemselves.\r\nThe Slovak Republic respects human rights and\r\nwelcomes all international initiatives which could bring\r\nresults in this sphere. We highly appreciate the\r\ncommencement of the activities of the High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights. We believe that this post will be an\r\nactive United Nations instrument to guarantee the protection\r\nof human rights, especially where they are most flagrantly\r\nviolated. At the beginning of 1994 we opened the Slovak\r\nNational Centre for Human Rights in Bratislava. In this\r\nconnection, I wish to express our gratitude to the\r\nNetherlands for its assistance in establishing this institution.\r\nThe gravity of the problem of refugees continues to\r\nincrease. I express the hope that the United Nations will\r\nnot underestimate this problem and that the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will no\r\nlonger have to fight financial problems in future.\r\nThe Slovak Republic supports the reform of the United\r\nNations. It considers the revitalization and restructuring of\r\nthe Security Council to be one of the crucial issues. We\r\nhope that the solution adopted will increase the efficiency\r\nof the Security Council and will contribute to the overall\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. We are of the opinion\r\nthat new permanent members of the Security Council must\r\nhave a global responsibility and be able to meet the ensuing\r\nfinancial obligations.\r\nWhen the mandate of the Security Council is fulfilled\r\nand sanctions are implemented, more attention should be\r\npaid to possible adverse impacts on third countries. We are\r\nconvinced that effective mechanisms of assistance to\r\naffected third countries should be seriously considered and\r\nestablished as soon as possible.\r\nSlovakia encounters many problems connected with\r\nthe transformation of society. It is crucial to solve the\r\neconomic and social issues of a transition process\r\nunprecedented in scale and method. The United Nations,\r\nwith its organs and specialized agencies, has an\r\nirreplaceable role in assisting their solution.\r\nI should now like to give some facts on the economic\r\nsituation of the Slovak Republic. Now that the first, basic\r\nsteps of transformation have been taken, the main goal of\r\nthe Slovak economy is to create permanent macroeconomic\r\nstability and conditions for substantial economic growth in\r\nthe years to come. My country, with 5.3 million\r\ninhabitants and with exports about 50 per cent of gross\r\ndomestic product, can be considered a small, open\r\neconomy. The Slovak Government is concentrating on\r\nspeeding up those reforms which should result in the\r\nquick transformation of ownership relations.\r\nConsiderable progress has been made in macroeconomic\r\nstabilization in the first six months of 1994. Real gross\r\ndomestic product has increased by 4.4 per cent. The\r\nState budget deficit represents only 3.8 per cent of gross\r\ndomestic product, and is considered a positive indicator.\r\nThanks to cooperation with, and assistance from, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the foreign currency\r\nreserves of the Central Bank have increased. These data\r\nare considered to be the first sign of economic revival.\r\nEconomic cooperation and, within its framework,\r\ninternational assistance are prerequisites for further\r\ndevelopment of economies in transition. United Nations\r\norgans and specialized agencies cooperate intensively with\r\nmy Government. Thanks to this cooperation, the\r\neconomic situation is substantially better than had been\r\nanticipated, and the Slovak Republic has become an\r\naccepted international partner in economic cooperation.\r\nThe Slovak Republic welcomes the increased\r\nattention by, and efforts of, the United Nations aimed at\r\nbringing the issues of development and economic\r\ncooperation to the foreground. We hope that the agenda\r\nfor development will initiate concrete steps in this sphere.\r\nWe particularly appreciate the efforts of the United\r\nNations in helping to resolve problems and difficulties\r\nencountered by the countries transforming their\r\neconomies, and we are of the opinion that within the\r\nUnited Nations framework there are more opportunities to\r\nfacilitate and speed up the integration of these economies\r\ninto the world economy.\r\nIn the past decade the number of least developed\r\ncountries has increased horrendously. This results in an\r\nurgent appeal to all mankind, but especially the\r\nindustrially developed countries. However, at the same\r\ntime we cannot avoid the primary responsibility of the\r\nleast developed countries for their own destiny. The\r\nSlovak Republic offers assistance, within its own means\r\nand possibilities, especially through the participation of\r\nSlovak experts in development programmes - for\r\nexample, in education and health care. Slovakia is\r\nprepared to engage in organizational work for the\r\nInternational Year for the Eradication of Poverty, 1996.\r\nI should also like to emphasize the importance of the\r\nrecently concluded International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, held in Cairo. The fact that it\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nsucceeded in reaching an agreement and adopting the Final\r\nDocument is a signal that the international community is\r\naware of its responsibility for global issues of humanity,\r\nand that international conferences and discussions are the\r\nonly right battlefield for the solution of problems, no matter\r\nhow sensitive and complicated they may be.\r\nAs can be seen from the facts I have set out, Slovakia,\r\nas one of the youngest Members of the United Nations,\r\nwishes not only to \"take\", but also intends to be actively\r\ninvolved in United Nations programmes, and has the\r\ncapabilities. My country has much to offer developing\r\ncountries. Slovak experts, with their know-how and\r\nexperience, are prepared actively to participate in United\r\nNations development programmes. Slovak products and\r\ntechnologies tested under demanding conditions could\r\ncontribute to the efficiency of these development\r\nprogrammes. In the sphere of the development of human\r\nresources, Slovakia, with a long tradition in this field, offers\r\na variety of courses at universities.\r\nMy country has a difficult task to carry out:\r\ntransformation of the economy. The United Nations also\r\nhas a difficult task; that of adapting itself to the new\r\nrealities and adjusting its structure and activities\r\naccordingly. I wish to assure the Assembly that the Slovak\r\nRepublic is prepared to do its utmost to carry out the first\r\ntask and to participate actively in the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI wish to conclude my statement by wishing much\r\nsuccess to this year’s session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Estonia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jüri Luik.\r\nMr. Lüik (Estonia): I should like to congratulate\r\nMr. Essy on his election as President of this, the forty-\r\nninth, session of the General Assembly. The Estonian\r\npeople wish him all the best in this post.\r\nToday is a day of national mourning in my country.\r\nLate last night, amid stormy autumn winds, the passenger\r\nand car ferry Estonia, sailing from Tallinn to Stockholm,\r\nsank at high sea. Nearly 100 people have been saved, and\r\nrescue efforts are continuing. But most of the over 850\r\npeople who were aboard the Estonia are presumed to be\r\ndead. I should like to thank the President and all those who\r\nhave expressed their sorrow and sent condolences.\r\nIn this painful loss, we can draw some solace from\r\nthe global teamwork we have seen in the rescue efforts.\r\nLast night demonstrated beyond a doubt that the Baltic\r\nSea is a sea of cooperation. Swedish, Finnish, Danish\r\nand Estonian rescue units worked together, and we had\r\noffers of help from Russia, the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) and countless others. On behalf of\r\nmy Government, I thank all of those who helped us with\r\nthe rescue effort. The spirit of international cooperation\r\nsets a fine example for all of us here today.\r\nToday my country comes before this forum for the\r\nfirst time in half a century unfettered by the problem of\r\nthe presence of foreign troops on our soil. The role the\r\nUnited Nations played in helping to remove the last\r\nvestiges of the Second World War was not small. It is\r\ntherefore a special privilege for me to speak here today.\r\nIt is also not insignificant that this new era in the\r\nhistory of Estonia, Latvia and Germany coincides with the\r\nupcoming fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations. These two events would seem to call for\r\nsolemn reflection on the past or at least a joyous\r\ncelebration of the moment. But most of all, this new era\r\nrequires new approaches. Post-war security - be the war\r\nhot or cold - still hangs in a delicate balance. Because it\r\nis up to all of us, collectively, to decide which way the\r\nscales tip, I wish to focus on the future, on how we in\r\nEstonia are approaching this new era, and on some of the\r\nideas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations that\r\nwe believe deserve special attention in the next few years.\r\nOn 31 August, we marked the withdrawal of troops.\r\nThe celebrations and commemorations of this event\r\nsymbolized the end of one era and the beginning of\r\nanother. The withdrawal of the troops has had a\r\ntremendous effect in bringing us closer to normalization\r\nof relations with the Russian Federation, and we sincerely\r\nhope that the problem of officers who were demobilized\r\non our territory against the spirit and the letter of the\r\ntroop-withdrawal treaty will be solved. The troop\r\nwithdrawal was also a major step towards achieving\r\nsecurity in the Baltic region. But the problem of Baltic\r\nsecurity has not yet been solved - far from it.\r\nOne dimension of moving towards bona fide security\r\nundoubtedly lies in trying to improve relations with the\r\nRussian Federation. The potential for good will is in the\r\nair, and it is our duty, on both sides of the 1920 Tartu\r\nPeace Treaty, to seize the moment and make that peace\r\nagain. We might call this policy towards Russia one of\r\npositive engagement. This would involve, among other\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nqualities, mutual respect for sovereignty, mutual respect for\r\nnational security interests, mutual refraining from verbal\r\nand other confrontation, and mutual respect for international\r\nnorms of behaviour, particularly in the area of human\r\nrights.\r\nWe are willing to expend considerable energy to repair\r\na relationship that has been historically so complex. To do\r\nso is not only in our own interest and in that of Russia, but\r\nin the interest of regional, European and therefore global\r\nsecurity as well. I would emphasize, however, that in order\r\nfor this policy to be successful, it must be mutual. If, on\r\nthe other hand, our efforts are not reciprocated, then we\r\nmust be prepared to expend our energy in different ways.\r\nLately, we have noted with great concern talk of\r\ncreating new spheres of influence. We hear continuing use\r\nof the phrase \"the near abroad\". We observe similar\r\nattitudes in discussions about the enlargement of the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union. We\r\nare already well past the initial stages of building a\r\nEuropean security structure. A viable framework, based on\r\nshared values, that includes Central and East European\r\nStates is nearly in place. It is not only late but unacceptable\r\nto ponder the plans of architects who speak of spheres of\r\ninfluence and to consult contractors who wish to build on\r\nsand or, worse, on a slippery slope.\r\nThere are some specific ways in which the United\r\nNations can take advantage of the historic opportunity it\r\nfaces to encourage principled behaviour. One of them is to\r\nrender peace-keeping more effective by strengthening\r\npeace-keeping mechanisms, including the dissemination of\r\nbetter and more timely information to all Member States in\r\norder to garner the support necessary for any collective\r\naction. Rather than abdicating responsibility, whether due\r\nto benign neglect, expediency or funding problems, and\r\nallowing large States to act unilaterally, it means holding all\r\nStates in all regions to the same standards. It goes without\r\nsaying that in lending its name to any peacekeeping\r\noperations, the United Nations must stand by the\r\nfundamental principles of neutrality and multilateralism.\r\nThe United Nations should never become a mask behind\r\nwhich one country tries to assert dominance over another\r\nby means of peace-keeping.\r\nLet me add that Estonia is actively developing its own\r\npeace-keeping force, to be put, perhaps next year, at the\r\ndisposal of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nAnother area in which more effective mechanisms and\r\nmore stringent standards are needed is that of human rights,\r\nas reflected in the Vienna Declaration and plan of action\r\nof last year. I would stress the importance of the newly\r\nestablished Office of the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights taking on this task. We wish High Commissioner\r\nAyala Lasso success in this most important and\r\nchallenging endeavour.\r\nWe believe the High Commissioner can be\r\ninstrumental not only in improving the effectiveness of\r\nthe United Nations human rights mechanisms, but also in\r\nholding this body to strict standards. We believe that all\r\nStates should be measured according to the same human\r\nrights standards. I could not agree more with the\r\nobservation made by Russian Federation President Boris\r\nYeltsin two days ago in this forum that\r\n\"neither a selective approach nor double standards\r\nare permissible.\" (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n5th meeting, p. 2)\r\nIndeed, exceptions cannot be made on the basis of the\r\nsize of a nation, its cultural heritage or the political\r\ndelicacy of the situation. The standards that are applied\r\nto one country must be valid for all others - in other\r\nwords, there should be no elastic rulers.\r\nIn this regard, allow me to remind the Assembly of\r\nan open letter - an appeal, really, to morality in foreign\r\npolicy - which was signed by a host of political\r\nluminaries and published in September of last year in The\r\nWall Street Journal. I quote from the letter, entitled\r\n\"What the West Must Do In Bosnia\":\r\n\"Even if, like Kuwait in August 1990, all\r\nBosnia (and not just Sarajevo) were seized, it would\r\nbe essential for the democracies to make clear, as\r\nthey did in the case of Kuwait, that violent border\r\nchanges and ethnic cleansing will not stand. If the\r\nWest does not make that clear, it will have nothing\r\npersuasive to say ...\".\r\nSadly, the message in that letter remains applicable\r\ntoday. If the world’s democracies, led by the United\r\nNations, do not speak out for morality in the area of\r\nhuman rights, we will lose our ability to influence the\r\ncourse of events. Democracies must be willing to stand\r\nby the principles upon which our States and societies are\r\nbased. It is our sincere hope that non-selective\r\napplication of human rights standards will become the\r\nrule, not the exception.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nA third way the United Nations can take advantage of\r\nthis moment is to consider the global changes that have\r\ntaken place since 1945. Then, in the immediate post-war\r\nperiod, the composition of the Security Council was\r\nestablished by drawing a sharp distinction between the\r\nvictors and the vanquished. Times have changed. We\r\nmust now take into account the positive role that some\r\nStates in particular play in the international arena. And I\r\nhave in mind here Germany and Japan, States that have\r\nmore than demonstrated their commitment to democracy\r\nduring the last 50 years. Estonia strongly supports granting\r\nGermany and Japan permanent-member status in the\r\nSecurity Council as a recognition of their accomplishments\r\nand an acknowledgement of their stabilizing role in world\r\naffairs.\r\nI would turn now briefly to Estonia’s vision of its\r\nfuture role in the United Nations. Now that the issues\r\nwhich had hitherto demanded our intense attention have\r\nbeen more or less solved, we are freer to devote more\r\nenergy to wider issues that affect all of us. I am speaking\r\nhere of global phenomena such as terrorism, organized\r\ncrime, drug trafficking and smuggling of radioactive\r\nmaterials as well as health and social issues and\r\nenvironmental problems. These are issues that know no\r\nborders, and dealing with them requires a collective effort\r\non our part.\r\nOn this, the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, we face an enormous challenge. The war\r\n- I mean the Second World War - is finally over. But the\r\nreal battle - to safeguard human and civil rights for all\r\npersons, to strengthen security for all States, to preserve a\r\ncontinent undivided - this battle has only just begun. With\r\nintelligence, perseverance, goodwill, and a little luck, the\r\nnations gathered here can unite in the battle to make the\r\nnext 50 years more constructive than the last.\r\nMr. Araníbar Quiroga (Bolivia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I am honoured to convey the greetings of\r\nPresident Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada and of the people of\r\nBolivia to the Heads of State and Government in attendance\r\nat this the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly; to\r\nthe Foreign Ministers; to the President of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. Amara Essy, and to his predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, as well as to our dear friend\r\nVice-President Sergio Abreu; to Secretary-General Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali; and to the whole of the international\r\ncommunity, so worthily represented here.\r\nAs the highest forum of the peoples of the Earth, this\r\nnoble Assembly constitutes the ideal setting to reflect on\r\nand debate the issues of our day.\r\nBolivia is striving to enter the twenty-first century\r\nwhile bringing about substantial changes based on the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter.\r\nDuring its first year in office, the Government of\r\nPresident Sánchez de Lozada devoted its efforts to\r\ncarrying through the reforms needed to make the State an\r\neffective instrument for our society’s democratic\r\ndevelopment, centred on the well-being of our people.\r\nThus, our reforms have been based on the concept of\r\ncomprehensive development, combining human and\r\neconomic development, social equity, and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nNow that Bolivia has thus completed the reform of\r\nits political constitution, it is putting into effect changes\r\nthat will enable it to consolidate democracy and economic\r\ndevelopment, in conditions of fairness and social justice.\r\nMy country has embarked on a dynamic policy of\r\nparticipation by the people, a process of educational\r\nreform, and a recasting of the shareholding and\r\nproductive structures of public enterprises through an\r\ninnovative concept of capitalization.\r\nDuring the second phase of its programme, the\r\nBolivian Government is planning to implement new legal\r\nprovisions to increase investment and production in order\r\nto provide more and better job opportunities, and to find\r\nconcrete solutions to the problems of poverty and the\r\nmarginalization of broad sectors of society. It is in this\r\nconnection, in the context of our Government’s policy,\r\nthat the participation of the people is of particular\r\nsignificance.\r\nOn the subject of sustainable development, my\r\ncountry has proposed the holding of a meeting of\r\nPresidents of the hemisphere; that meeting is now\r\nscheduled for 1996 in Bolivia.\r\nThe future of our peoples and their material and\r\nspiritual well-being can only be the work of their own\r\nhands, as they are both the subjects and the objects of\r\ndevelopment. It is therefore most encouraging that - not\r\nonly within our country but within the United Nations\r\nsystem as well - there is a conviction that a central role\r\nfalls to organized participation, both individual and\r\ncollective, as an essential factor for change in a creative\r\nand positive direction.\r\nMechanisms for popular participation will make it\r\npossible to imbue the liberty, independence, sovereignty\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nand progress of nations with vitality and social content. It\r\nis a matter of appraising the role of all social sectors:\r\nworkers and entrepreneurs, women, indigenous and rural\r\ncommunities, the marginalized, the young, the elderly, the\r\ndisabled and all those who have the right and duty to\r\ncontribute to building a better future.\r\nIt is with that conviction that the Bolivian Government\r\nhas contributed actively to the preparatory work for the\r\nforthcoming World Summit for Social Development, to be\r\nheld in Copenhagen in 1995, and the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women, in Beijing the same year.\r\nIn that same spirit, the International Decade of the\r\nWorld’s Indigenous People will be inaugurated at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. My country is confident\r\nthat the observance of this Decade will be not merely\r\nsymbolic, but essentially a practical and concrete endeavour\r\nin its objectives and its scope. To that end, the meeting of\r\nrepresentatives of Latin American and Caribbean\r\nGovernments, grass-roots peasant organizations and\r\ninternational agencies, held in the Bolivian city of\r\nCochabamba last June, framed a series of recommendations\r\nto be included in the strategy of the Decade. Those\r\nrecommendations have also been brought to the attention of\r\nGovernments and the United Nations system. We hope to\r\nreceive a prompt and positive response so that the\r\nlegitimate claims of indigenous peoples will not be lost in\r\nthe labyrinths of international bureaucracy or the oblivion\r\nof another 500 years of solitude.\r\nResolving age-old problems surely calls for a great\r\ncapacity to understand the values, customs and ways of life\r\nof other cultures. Bolivia hopes that the International\r\nDecade of the World’s Indigenous People will provide an\r\nopportunity for the international community to fully\r\nunderstand the topic of the coca leaf, a form of vegetation\r\ntraditionally grown in Andean regions. The cultural and\r\nmedicinal uses of the coca leaf need to be re-evaluated in\r\norder to distinguish it clearly from the social problems\r\nbrought about by the abuse of one of its derivatives in the\r\ndeveloped countries, which creates a growing demand\r\nassociated with an international cycle of crime.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to declare formally, once\r\nagain, that the Government and the people of Bolivia are\r\nearnestly and firmly committed to international efforts to\r\nfind the best-suited mechanisms to guarantee the success of\r\nthe policies delineated within the framework of the changes\r\nrecommended in General Assembly resolution 48/12,\r\nadopted at the last session.\r\nLess than two weeks ago, on an initiative of\r\nPresident Sánchez de Lozada, the most representative\r\norganizations of Bolivian society, together with the armed\r\nforces and the police, took a historic step when they\r\ndebated the problems of the coca leaf in a framework of\r\npluralistic participation and cooperation. The main\r\nconclusions of that meeting, which I take the liberty of\r\nsummarizing to this great forum of nations, stressed the\r\nurgency of combating drug trafficking through a world-\r\nwide strategy of shared responsibility; the need to adopt\r\nas a primary goal the fight against the dire poverty\r\naffecting over two-thirds of Bolivia’s population; and\r\nsupport for initiatives aimed at the comprehensive\r\ndevelopment of coca-producing areas.\r\nBolivia is grateful for the international community’s\r\nwillingness to draw a perfectly clear distinction between\r\nthe positive aspects of the native coca leaf and the grave\r\nharm done by dint of the external demand for cocaine.\r\nWe trust that this positive attitude will make it possible in\r\nthe near future to address this problem without prejudice.\r\nBut the international agenda at the end of the\r\ncentury encompasses other equally complex issues that\r\nhave recently been brought to light by the end of the cold\r\nwar, although their roots can be traced back to centuries\r\nof accumulated injustice.\r\nThe Republic of South Africa has given the world\r\ninvaluable lessons in its struggle against apartheid and for\r\ndemocracy. My country is joyful at the outcome of that\r\nprocess and, on behalf of Bolivia, I welcome President\r\nNelson Mandela to the General Assembly.\r\nDeeply moved as well by news of the tragedies in\r\nRwanda and in other regions of the world, Bolivia\r\nexpresses its solidarity with peoples which, through\r\nviolence and catastrophe, are showing us what we sow\r\nwhen problems are not resolved in timely fashion,\r\nproblems such as hunger, poverty, mass migration, the\r\nvarious forms of injustice inherited from colonial times\r\nand the plundering and lawless acts carried out even\r\ntoday by Powers large and small against other States.\r\nBolivia welcomes the advances achieved through\r\ndialogue in the Middle East, and we trust that in the\r\nfuture dialogue will become the principal instrument in\r\ndealing successfully with international disputes and\r\nconflicts. The Bolivian people hopes for a just and\r\nlasting peace between Israel, Palestine and the Arab\r\npeoples. May the deliberations of the General Assembly\r\ncontribute to consolidating that process.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nThe situations in the former Yugoslavia and in other\r\nareas are a direct consequence of actions in the service of\r\nmisguided geopolitical interests aimed at social and political\r\ndestabilization of foreign territories, We hope that the\r\nsenseless repetition of such practices, which have had such\r\nwoeful effects in Central Europe, Asia and Africa, will not\r\nlead to similar disasters in other regions. Furthermore, the\r\nGovernment and the people of Bolivia condemn policies of\r\n\"ethnic cleansing\" in the strongest terms and call upon the\r\ninternational community to take resolute and clear measures\r\nto put an end to those actions and to punish those\r\nresponsible for them.\r\nLatin America stands unconditionally in support of\r\ndemocracy and against the illegal use of military means and\r\nforce, in accordance with the recent declaration of the\r\npresidential summit of the Rio Group, the resolutions of the\r\nOrganization of American States and of the United Nations\r\nand the numerous proclamations of Parliaments and popular\r\norganizations from all over the continent.\r\nDemocracy, of course, cannot be left undefended.\r\nBolivia has had the bitter experience of long dictatorial\r\ninterruptions in its institutional life. Consequently, Bolivia\r\nstands today with the people of Haiti and its legitimate\r\nGovernment, and it supports the immediate return of\r\nPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the restoration of the\r\ndemocratic regime.\r\nHistory has shown that peace, justice and respect for\r\nthe principle of self-determination can be guaranteed only\r\nwhen there are consolidated democratic institutions capable\r\nof defending and promoting human rights. Solidarity\r\ncannot be left at the rostrum. My country reiterates its\r\nwillingness to help, within its available means, in the\r\nprocess of restoring Haitian democracy to the extent the\r\nlegitimate Government of that country deems our help\r\nuseful.\r\nThe ending of the cold war must apply also to Latin\r\nAmerica and make it possible, through dialogue and\r\nunderstanding among the parties concerned, for Cuba to be\r\nreintegrated into the inter-American community.\r\nAll States of the world must contribute to ensuring\r\npeace, brotherhood and the timely solution of problems that\r\nare as yet unresolved. To that end, action must be taken to\r\nenable peoples to develop, since economic backwardness\r\nand its social effects are at the root of the crises and\r\nconflicts we face.\r\nWe therefore attach high priority to the themes of\r\nthe \"Agenda for Development\". Economic\r\ncomplementarity, the transfer of technology, trade, the\r\nopening up of economies, foreign investment and co-\r\noperation should be our instruments for strengthening\r\nsolidarity and friendship among peoples and\r\nGovernments.\r\nIn this spirit, Bolivia strongly supports Latin\r\nAmerican unity and subregional integration, hemispheric\r\nagreements, and any opportunity that may present itself\r\nfor exchanges between nations.\r\nThese aims - cooperation and complementarity,\r\nfriendship and solidarity - must serve as the basis of the\r\nnew international order. For that reason, the observance\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter in\r\nSan Francisco should provide an opportunity to make\r\nsubstantive progress in adapting the United Nations to the\r\nnew realities and demands of the world community.\r\nGovernments on all continents must demonstrate the\r\nability to save future generations from the scourge of war.\r\nWe must make human rights, individual and collective,\r\nfully effective. International justice must become possible\r\nand be assured, and social progress within the broadest\r\nconcept of freedom must be promoted.\r\nIn international relations in the third millennium, law\r\nmust cease to be the instrument of the stronger, serving\r\nto entrench injustices, and must become the sole and\r\neffective means of resolving disputes, rectifying the errors\r\nand excesses of past generations as often as may be\r\nnecessary.\r\nOn the subject of respect for the rules of inter-State\r\nrelations, Bolivia welcomes the entry into force of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and\r\nwelcomes the fact that 1998 is to be the International\r\nYear of the Oceans. Convinced that recovering our\r\ncountry’s access to the sea is an inalienable right of\r\nBolivia, the Government of President Sánchez de Lozada\r\nis working to secure for the Bolivian people, during the\r\ncurrent decade, a real solution to the unjust land-locked\r\nsituation with which it has had to contend for over\r\n100 years. My country believes in the force of\r\nconvictions, in the force of international solidarity, in the\r\nforce and the evolution of law, and in the possibilities of\r\nfriendly negotiation with a view to overcoming disputes.\r\nDemocracy must find clear expression in inter-State\r\nrelations. Participation by countries large and small in\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nthe resolution of issues that affect all of them must be\r\nequitable and not, as is sometimes the case, mere words.\r\nThis presupposes, among other things, a change in the\r\norganization and composition of the Security Council so\r\nthat with its permanent and non-permanent members, it will\r\nbe representative of the realities and requirements of\r\nappropriate participation, reflecting the obvious emergence\r\nof new centres of power in different parts of the world. It\r\nwill also be necessary to strengthen the role of the General\r\nAssembly and to restore the United Nations its central role\r\nin the resolution of the major economic problems of the\r\nplanet, a task which, for the present, remains the exclusive\r\npreserve of the super-Powers.\r\nThe right to development is an objective necessity,\r\nalthough exercise of the right still seems remote for the vast\r\nmajority of the world’s population. We must assume an\r\neffective commitment to give that right the same priority\r\ntreatment as is given to the human rights of individuals.\r\nIf the present generation is unable to defeat growing\r\npoverty and secure employment opportunities for the\r\nalready vast global army of the indigent, it will be\r\nimpossible to ensure the peace and well-being in the\r\ndeveloped regions of the world. Population growth, mass\r\nmigrations and globalization will take their toll, with a\r\nnegative effect on the dignity, the peaceful co-existence,\r\nand the hopes of all mankind for a better life.\r\nOver the centuries, the Andean peoples of Bolivia\r\nhave wisely been guided by three fundamental rules which,\r\nin the Quechua language, are: \"AMA SUA, AMA\r\nLLULLA, AMA KHELLA\", meaning \"Do not steal, do not\r\nbe idle, do not lie\".\r\nIf those three rules were also applied in relations\r\nbetween States and nations today, they would have to be:\r\n\"Do not unjustly exploit the fruits of your neighbours’\r\nwork. Do not complacently enjoy your splendid life-style\r\namid universal poverty. Do not make promises of\r\nsolidarity and understanding that you are not prepared to\r\nkeep.\"\r\nI feel sure that the ability of all of us to live together\r\nwould be infinitely enhanced were we to be guided by such\r\nrules.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of The Former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, His Excellency Mr.\r\nStevo Crvenkovski.\r\nMr. Crvenkovski (The Former Yugoslav Republic\r\nof Macedonia): Allow me at the outset, Mr. President, to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Essy on his election and to wish all\r\nparticipants in this Assembly success in their work. My\r\nappreciation also goes to the Secretary-General for his\r\nable leadership of our Organization.\r\nAt this year’s session the General Assembly will\r\ndeal with numerous issues of vital importance for the\r\nwhole of humanity. In the desire continuously to enhance\r\nthe role of the United Nations as a universal organization\r\nof irreplaceable character, every Member State must make\r\nits utmost contribution to the establishment of a better and\r\nmore prosperous world and to improving relations\r\nbetween the peoples on this planet, in the spirit of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. In that spirit, my country,\r\nthe Republic of Macedonia, is prepared, with all of its\r\nmodest forces, to contribute to achieving these aims,\r\nwhich are of universal interest, and to improving the\r\nfunctioning and the role of this Organization. I would\r\nlike to assure the Assembly that our delegation will make\r\nits full contribution to that end.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIn the Republic of Macedonia, hopes run high that\r\nthe work of the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly will result in the adoption of the \"agenda for\r\ndevelopment - and we deem development the most\r\nimportant issue facing humanity on the threshold of the\r\nnew millennium. We are convinced that the work of this\r\nsession will also have a positive effect in overcoming\r\nacute crises and conflicts in the world. In short, we are\r\nprepared to make our full contribution to the\r\nstrengthening of the role and the importance of the United\r\nNations for peace and security in the world, economic\r\nprogress and the prosperity of humanity.\r\nThe last decade of this century has shown very\r\nacutely the problem of economic and social development\r\nin the world. On the one hand, there are the hopes of\r\nhumanity, rightly directed towards the world of highly\r\ndeveloped countries as a guarantor of economic progress,\r\nsocial safety, human dignity and a healthy environment.\r\nOn the other hand, underdeveloped countries are facing\r\nthe elementary issues of survival and escape from\r\npoverty, economic despair and insecurity.\r\nThe countries in transition, including my own, are\r\ngoing through a painful period of trying to find their own\r\nplace in the world of market economies and democracy\r\nand are additionally burdened by their own devastated\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\neconomies, social problems and threats of new, regressive\r\nand undemocratic situations.\r\nThis controversial picture of the world shows the full\r\ncomplexity of international economic and social\r\ndevelopment and thus raises the question of a possible way\r\nout of such a situation. I am quite certain that the majority\r\nof the world sees the solution neither in various new\r\nideological concepts nor in new regional and political\r\ndivisions along such lines - and even less in ideas leading\r\nto a division of responsibilities and rights among countries\r\nbased on false altruism and utopian blueprints.\r\nA solution is possible only if we acknowledge the\r\ninterdependence of economic and social development. This\r\nis a fact to which no nation today can remain indifferent,\r\nregardless of its size and level of development. It is more\r\nthan obvious that the economic problems of the\r\nundeveloped world constitute a serious threat to the\r\ndeveloped countries. Furthermore, it is more than clear that\r\na solution to the problem of underdevelopment cannot be\r\nsought in the form of social assistance or gifts. On the\r\ncontrary, the very essence of global economic and social\r\ninterdependence teaches us that by helping the undeveloped\r\ncountries solve their problems developed countries are in\r\nfact helping themselves. Thus, the inferior position of the\r\nunderdeveloped should be redressed through mutual\r\nresponsibility and by opening the prospects for economic\r\ndevelopment and democracy under the best possible\r\nconditions on the world market.\r\nIn that sense, the successful end of the Uruguay\r\nRound of negotiations and the establishment of the new\r\nWorld Trade Organization in early 1995 are indeed\r\nencouraging. I am convinced that the new General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will stimulate the\r\nfurther liberalization of world trade and enhance the world\r\ntrade system, because the reduction and elimination of\r\nbarriers in world trade will provide a chance not only for a\r\nrealistic way out for the underdeveloped and countries in\r\ntransition, but also for the global growth of world trade and\r\neconomic cooperation as well.\r\nIt is no less important that the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized institutions aim their efforts at increasing\r\ninternational financial support for development and at\r\ntackling such acute problems as arrears and debt servicing.\r\nThese would be very concrete and positive steps towards\r\novercoming the problems of underdevelopment.\r\nThe comprehensive character of these problems must\r\nbe regarded with a very keen awareness of two global\r\naspects as well: protection of the environment and\r\ndemographic processes. Without these two aspects, a\r\nuniversal programme for economic and social\r\ndevelopment cannot be envisaged nor can any future for\r\nhumanity. Global economic interdependence strongly\r\nemphasizes the importance of regional and world\r\neconomic integration processes. Their outlook and\r\nadvantages are unquestionable and they should be assisted\r\nand encouraged by the United Nations. My country\r\nviews its support of such policies as increasing the\r\npossibility of and prospects for its own development as\r\nwell as the development of other developing countries and\r\ncountries in transition.\r\nDespite all the worthwhile efforts being made, I\r\nregret to note that the Declaration issued at the World\r\nConference on Human Rights in Vienna is not being\r\ncarried out as expected. The world is still faced with\r\ncrude and massive violations of human rights. The\r\ntragedies in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda are\r\ndistressing confirmations of this fact. There are many\r\ncountries where the economic, social and cultural rights\r\nof the people are being violated. Policies of racial, ethnic\r\nand religious discrimination are widespread. We have\r\nbeen witnesses to \"ethnic cleansing\" and genocide. And,\r\nwhat is most regrettable of all, these are all used as\r\nreasons for waging wars, murdering innocent people on\r\na massive scale and destroying towns and villages.\r\nThe region of the Balkans where my country is\r\nsituated is one such unfortunate example. The war in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina continues. All the efforts of the\r\ninternational community, the Security Council and the\r\nmost influential countries of the world cannot convince\r\nthe Bosnian Serbs that peace is the only solution. It is\r\ntrue that the forces of peace are growing. However, the\r\nfeeling of uncertainty in the region is still present, and\r\neven spiraling. It is difficult to foresee a settlement of\r\nthe situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia that\r\ndoes not include full mutual recognition of the newly\r\nindependent States and the establishment of diplomatic\r\nrelations between them.\r\nThe sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro have\r\nseriously burdened economic conditions in the\r\nneighbouring countries, in a region where economic ties\r\nhad already been severed and economic assistance from\r\nthe international community is urgently needed.\r\nInsecurity in the South Balkans is also growing. The\r\nRepublic of Macedonia is being exposed to the classic\r\neconomic aggression of a unilateral economic embargo\r\nintroduced by Greece in February this year in order to\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nimpose its will in matters concerning Macedonian national\r\nidentity. Serious tensions have also been caused by the\r\nmost recent developments in Greek-Albanian and\r\nGreek-Turkish relations. These are all elements of great\r\nconcern to us.\r\nDue attention to this situation is being devoted by the\r\nrelevant responsible international factors and, within this\r\nframework, by the Security Council. I should like to\r\nreaffirm the positive role and contribution of the peace-\r\nkeeping forces of the United Nations deployed on a\r\npreventive mission in Macedonia, a very successful action\r\nundertaken in the interests of peace and deserving wider\r\nsupport.\r\nWith its peaceful policy and position, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia is a factor for stability in the region. We are\r\nsparing no effort to demonstrate that, even in a region as\r\nturbulent as ours, other solutions are viable; that peace is\r\nguaranteed by human and minority rights; that cohabitation,\r\ntolerance and mutual understanding between various ethnic\r\ngroups is possible; that relations between States become\r\nmore stable when the principles of the inviolability of\r\nborders are respected through cooperation on an equal\r\nfooting; and that problems can be resolved successfully\r\nonly through dialogue and political means. For us, a way\r\nout of the historical frustrations and war myths in the\r\nBalkans is possible only through the implementation of the\r\nprinciples of the new European model of open borders,\r\nintegration and cooperation.\r\nThat is why, today, the Balkan region needs the\r\nsupport of the international community on a number of key\r\nissues: an end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\r\nprevention of a spillover of that war, and the establishment\r\nof permanent foundations for peace; the strengthening of\r\ndemocratic processes in all countries and in the region as a\r\nwhole, and, especially, an increase in awareness of human\r\nrights and the rights of national minorities; support for\r\neconomic reform in these countries, in view of the fact that\r\nmost of them are now in transition, and, most important,\r\ntheir incorporation into collective security mechanisms.\r\nMr. Ben Yahia (Tunisia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe worst threat for the Balkans is the emergence of\r\nnew divisions and regrouping along religious or ethnic\r\nlines. The Balkans cannot remain as a living relic of bloc\r\ndivisions in Europe and the world, since if it does it will\r\nbecome an open threat to peace and stability on the\r\ncontinent and in the world. This can best be avoided\r\nthrough preventive action by the international community\r\nin this region, not only in the form of monitoring\r\nmissions but through concrete policies which get the job\r\ndone.\r\nAllow me to conclude by expressing our hope that\r\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly will serve\r\nto strengthen the role of the United Nations, in the\r\ninterest of peace and security in the world, in the interest\r\nof harmony in global economic and social development,\r\nin the interest of the survival and protection of planet\r\nEarth and in the interest of humanity.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Planning and\r\nEnvironment of the Republic of Seychelles, Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Danielle de St. Jorre.\r\nMrs. de St. Jorre (Seychelles) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Mr. President, may we congratulate Mr. Essy\r\nand wish him every possible success in exercising your\r\nmandate.\r\nSeychelles would like to take this opportunity also\r\nto pay tribute to the Secretary-General for the timely and\r\njudicious initiatives which he is constantly taking to\r\npromote peace, justice and development.\r\nWe have gathered together to express the profound\r\naspirations of the countries we represent. We all have\r\nour specific problems, our differences, our advantages and\r\nour handicaps. We all have many unresolved questions\r\nwhich stem from an international situation where the\r\nfactors of political and economic instability are becoming\r\nincreasingly frequent.\r\nThe hesitations of a changing world tend to engender\r\na feeling of pessimism, as we see contemporary history\r\nbeing made.\r\nBetween the industrially developed countries and\r\nthose who are still marking time on the path to\r\ndevelopment, considerable barriers are blocking the road\r\nto sharing and to solidarity.\r\nWe now see cruel dissensions arising among peoples\r\nthat were previously bound by brotherhood.\r\nOn the international scene, where we are witnessing\r\na relentless confrontation between divergent interests,\r\nwhat place do we now give to the human dimension in\r\nrelationships?\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nThe end of this century is constantly being redefined\r\nby shocks, upheavals and various types of aggression born\r\nof negativism.\r\nMore than ever, the success of our societies will\r\ndepend on their capacity to absorb these shocks and, when\r\nthere is nothing or little left to reinvest courage,\r\ndetermination and perseverance, in spite of sometimes\r\nterrible lack of understanding.\r\nBut we also have to reinvest our capabilities, our\r\nfunds, our means and our inborn willingness - in other\r\nwords, unprecedented alliances have to be struck; for there\r\nis no longer time to philosophize about the world we shall\r\nbequeath to our great grandchildren. Because of the\r\nunprecedented speeding up of history demographic,\r\neconomic and social projections are becoming alarming in\r\nthe medium term and no longer in the long term to which\r\nwe had grown accustomed through our cozy selfishness or\r\nour defiance in the face of the unforeseeable.\r\nThe phenomenon of exponential growth, which is\r\nwidening gaps and encouraging rivalry, causes immediate\r\nrather than delayed reactions. We have become our own\r\nheirs! Undoubtedly, there is more food for thought in this\r\nidea than in many statements.\r\nThat illustrates to what extent our efforts must be both\r\nplanned and creative. It also means that the immediate\r\nproblem to be tackled is to define our priorities. Here, my\r\nthinking is consonant with much of what has been said\r\nfrom this rostrum. Certainly there is no lack of those who\r\nplead for a safer, healthier and more prosperous world.\r\nAnd so many conferences and seminars have echoed the\r\nsame thought and have recalled this idea in their final\r\ndocuments. But we are aware that we have to go beyond\r\nthis; hence, we are asking for action programmes which\r\nmobilize experience, energy and imagination. When\r\ncontinuity of effort is the key factor for success, we must\r\nexpand the underpinnings of projects, assess results and\r\nrenew assistance.\r\nIn other words, what we are advocating is a definitely\r\nprescriptive approach, rather than the sort of analytical and\r\ndescriptive exercises which has been the comfortable route\r\nof many international gatherings.\r\nIf we are specific in defining the areas of our\r\ndeliberations, then the ensuing action will necessarily be\r\nbased on precise, useful and needed dynamics.\r\nThis specificity, in the case of Seychelles as in the\r\ncase of more than 30 territories throughout the world, is,\r\nfrom the point of view of development, the dual\r\nconstraint of geographic and demographic smallness and\r\nbeing an island.\r\nNeed we recall that the situation of small island\r\nStates can, in many respects, provide indications as to the\r\nfuture of mankind. Here, more than anywhere else,\r\nbecause of their vulnerability - whether it be due to the\r\nfragile ecosystems, the scant economic outlets or the lack\r\nof human resources - any dependence necessarily impacts\r\nupon the very future of the societies concerned.\r\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held in\r\nBarbados, was indeed extremely beneficial for us all. It\r\nfocused attention on the particular situation of those small\r\nStates whose relatively high per capita income does not\r\naccurately reflect the reality of a situation which donors\r\ntend to tie to any aid for development.\r\nThere is no doubt that that Conference has been the\r\nsource of great hope for the small island States. But\r\nsome remain sceptical. In any case, we hope it will lead\r\nto a change in attitude on the part of the industrialized\r\ncountries with respect to the unique situation of small\r\ndeveloping island States, for it is the industrialized\r\ncountries that will not only have to take up and enlarge\r\nupon the concerns of the small island States but also have\r\nto set in motion the strategies and the plans of action,\r\nwhich are the only real vehicles of change or of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFar be it from us to engage here in singling out the\r\ncountries or international organizations concerned.\r\nHowever, two years after the Rio Summit we are very\r\ndisappointed to see that the provisions of Agenda 21 have\r\nrarely given rise to actions. Does this mean that the\r\nconcept of lasting and sustainable development is going\r\nto be severely compromised because of a lack of\r\nsolidarity and international support and failure to respect\r\ncommitments?\r\nLet us get to the core of the problem. The\r\nharmonization of development policies and measures to\r\nprotect the environment necessarily implies the definition\r\nof specific budgetary categories by priority, based on\r\ncriteria of complementarity as between national effort and\r\ninternational efforts. This must be done free from any\r\nspirit of charity, as well as divorced from any evaluation\r\nbased on per capita income.\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nLet us not forget the backdrop to all this, the fact that\r\nin an era where everything occurs on a worldwide level the\r\nindividual and collective responsibility of States calls for a\r\nglobal approach and equitable sharing of the cost and moral\r\ninvestment the environment represents. Those\r\nresponsibilities must be consciously assumed.\r\nAll these are indicators that merit the attention - the\r\nunwavering attention - of decision-making bodies and\r\ninternational donors. In the past, many pronouncements\r\nhave concluded on a hopeful note. Joined together in an\r\norchestral score, such notes would barely fill out a refrain\r\nin praise of development, one that, like a clear conscience,\r\ncan often sound hollow.\r\nAnd yet we do not doubt the wisdom of our\r\nnegotiating partners. There are surely some who would like\r\nto deal with questions of development from a dialectical\r\nviewpoint, but that is not true of us. If, for us, the essential\r\nthing is not to hesitate to be specific, we seek, in return,\r\nmeasures that will be real, meaningful and measurable.\r\nMore generally, this could apply to the role women\r\nshould play in the development process. This is an old\r\ndebate. Fortunately, the time is now past when women\r\nwere viewed as non-conventional vehicles of progress.\r\nAbolishing a principle, however, although paving the way\r\nfor many improvements, can also generate a considerable\r\npotential for inertia, for the walls of hypocrisy, as we all\r\nknow, are infinitely thick. It is not enough to quote some\r\ncases of women who are entrepreneurs or decision-makers,\r\nThere have always been some effective women. The\r\nimportant thing is to modify behaviour and practices in real\r\nterms, at the societal level, and to analyse and transpose\r\nthose models and ideas which have from time to time led\r\nto good results. That is what we expect from the Beijing\r\nConference.\r\nWhere natural prerogative is concerned, we cannot of\r\ncourse speak of delegating authority but here too of\r\nequitable and responsible sharing. Indeed, do we in fact\r\nhave a choice?\r\nWomen must act within their communities as a\r\nproponent force that is open to change and capable of\r\nenriching the dynamic processes linked to changing values.\r\nIt is impossible to give life without being concerned about\r\nsurvival, without being deeply aware of the changes that\r\naffect the individual or the society whenever they give rise\r\nto uncertainty and muddy the waters.\r\nHumanism obviously owes a great debt to women.\r\nLet us enrich it with our understanding. The woman’s\r\nidentity is strong, but in many places there is still a lack\r\nof both recognition and expression, which are the\r\nfoundations of her legitimacy.\r\nThe ideal of legitimacy is a noble concept, in\r\naddition to being a good working notion. It is legitimate\r\nto look forward to the fulfilment of the promises made in\r\nsolemn declarations; it is legitimate to expect that\r\nintentions so boldly and courageously stated will become\r\npromises, and it is also legitimate, when the urgency of\r\nthe matter no longer leaves time for either declarations of\r\nintention or promises, to take action. Consensus can\r\ncome later.\r\nHere, and in the same spirit, I should like to\r\nemphasize our interest in the proposal made by the\r\nDirector-General of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for swift\r\nhumanitarian action - what we might call a \"spontaneous\r\nreaction\" - whenever called for. For here again we are\r\ntalking about the legitimacy that endows the human entity\r\nwith dignity and makes it worthy of respect.\r\nBefore concluding I should like to appeal to all\r\ncountries and peoples present here to unite our efforts to\r\ntake one large step towards world brotherhood. Let us\r\noverturn the rigid barriers of all kinds of self-interest, let\r\nus be attentive to the needs of others and the future of our\r\nplanet. Let us shape our relationships for active solidarity\r\nand willing adherence to the principle of shared\r\nresponsibility.\r\nOn such vital questions there is no place for trite\r\nofficial statements. In coming decades, no one will be\r\nfooled by our unwillingness to engage, openly, fully and\r\nwith determination, on the path of well-being, especially\r\nwhen it is the neediest of us who most require it.\r\nThat is the price of true unity among nations. And\r\nwe in Seychelles harbor this desire to stand alongside all\r\ncountries in concluding the unprecedented alliance that\r\nwill guide the great ship of mankind towards the shores\r\nof the third millenium.\r\nIt is up to us to ensure that those shores will be\r\nwelcoming ones.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I call\r\non Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Jabr Al-Thani, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Qatar.\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nMr. Al-Thani (Qatar) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI should like, at the outset, to express to Mr. Essy and to\r\nhis friendly country my Government’s and my personal\r\ncongratulations on his election to the Presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session. We are\r\nconfident that his abilities and skills will enable him to\r\ndischarge his responsibilities in the best possible manner.\r\nI should like also to congratulate the members of the\r\nGeneral Committee on their election to that body.\r\nOn this occasion I cannot fail to express the\r\nappreciation of the delegation of the State of Qatar, as well\r\nas my personal appreciation, to Mr. Essy’s predecessor as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Ambassador Samuel\r\nInsanally, who represents the friendly Republic of Guyana,\r\nfor his excellent leadership and the work carried out during\r\nhis tenure.\r\nIt is also my pleasure to extend our congratulations to\r\nthose States that have recently joined our international\r\nOrganization. We look forward to their constructive and\r\neffective participation in the activities of the United Nations\r\nand to their defence of its principles.\r\nIn that context, I salute the delegation of the Republic\r\nof South Africa and that country’s great leader, Nelson\r\nMandela, the first African President of the State, which, in\r\nthis new chapter of its history, will undoubtedly be a new\r\nMember representing the African continent and the\r\ninternational community. We are convinced that it will\r\nplay an outstanding role, for which it is eminently qualified\r\nby its stature, as well as by its expertise in all fields.\r\nI should like also to reaffirm the State of Qatar’s full\r\nconfidence in and special appreciation of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\ncommitment and devotion in the service of this international\r\nOrganization and for his efforts to uphold the noble\r\nprinciples of the United Nations and to promote its\r\ninternational peace-keeping and peacemaking role in dealing\r\nwith international problems and crises. This is a role that\r\nwill undoubtedly increase in importance.\r\nThe General Assembly’s forty-ninth session is being\r\nheld in the shadow of dynamic and rapid changes in\r\ninternational relations. These rapid dynamic changes have\r\nnot yet reached their culmination. We are in a period of\r\ntransition wherein new patterns of international relations are\r\nconstantly emerging. It is a period in which the so-called\r\nnew international order is being formed.\r\nThe most important underpinnings on which this\r\nnew order must rest are, in our view, respect for the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations and its\r\nCharter, in particular, the principle of sovereign co-\r\nequality, the willingness of States to honour their\r\ncommitments in good faith, non-intervention in the\r\ninternal affairs of other States, the control by States of\r\ntheir natural resources, the non-use and the absence of the\r\nthreat of the use of force against the territorial integrity or\r\npolitical independence of other States, and the resolution\r\nof international disputes by peaceful means in accordance\r\nwith the principles of international law through mediation,\r\ndialogue or through the International Court of Justice.\r\nWith the ending of the cold war, a new era has\r\ndawned in the United Nations. This international\r\nOrganization is now being resorted to increasingly and\r\nmore urgently. The United Nations mechanism is now\r\nsquarely in the forefront of international efforts to face up\r\nto problems that in the past were intractable. Such\r\nproblems are now being examined and debated in a\r\nserious manner in the United Nations and its specialized\r\norgans and agencies with the aim of finding suitable\r\nsolutions thereto.\r\nIn this regard, the State of Qatar believes that the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized organs and agencies\r\nare the most appropriate framework for deliberation on\r\nissues relating to peace-keeping and peacemaking, the\r\npeaceful settlement of international disputes, questions of\r\ndevelopment and the forging of just and balanced\r\neconomic and social relations.\r\nGiven today’s challenges, there is no doubt that the\r\nsolving of such problems should be the collective\r\nresponsibility of all States regardless of size, if the\r\nsolutions devised are to be compatible with the interests\r\nof the entire international community. Therefore, the\r\nState of Qatar supports efforts to restructure this\r\ninternational Organization and its bodies in order to make\r\nthem more democratic and dynamic so that they may\r\nbecome more suited to the task of satisfying new\r\ninternational requirements and dealing with the challenges\r\nof peace, development, the issues of international peace\r\nand security, as well as economic and social issues.\r\nThese issues are dictated by the radical\r\ntransformations in the patterns of international relations.\r\nFirst of all, there must be a balanced relationship between\r\nthe General Assembly as the principal political body, the\r\nSecurity Council as the body responsible for questions of\r\nsecurity, and the Economic and Social Council as the\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nbody responsible for issues of economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn addition, the General Assembly and its resolutions\r\nmust be given a more effective role as a framework for\r\ndeliberations and negotiations and for the adoption of\r\nresolutions on issues of international importance. This is\r\nfully in line with the commitment by all States to the\r\nprinciple of sovereign co-equality and the right of effective\r\nparticipation in the upholding of the common interests of\r\nthe international community.\r\nNo one State or group of States, regardless of stature\r\nor power, should monopolize the fashioning of the new\r\ninternational order in the absence of the United Nations,\r\nwhich is the true representative of the international\r\ncommunity. Such a new order must be fashioned by all\r\nStates collectively through the United Nations, whose\r\nstature and efficacy must be enhanced and supported as the\r\nonly forum for international deliberations, the body\r\nresponsible for international peace and security and the\r\nbody that has the overall responsibility for economic and\r\nsocial development, the protection of the environment and\r\nof human rights as well as for combating drugs and\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn this context, I should like to express my support for\r\nthe statement in the Secretary-General’s report \"An Agenda\r\nfor Peace\" that democracy within the family of nations\r\nrequires the fullest consultation, participation and\r\nengagement of all States, large and small, in the work of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nI should like to refer also to the statement in the same\r\nreport that the employment of preventive diplomacy\r\nrequires prior knowledge of potential disputes, participation\r\nin peacemaking and peace-keeping, support for the\r\nagreements concluded and the taking of measures that aim\r\nat resolving the economic, social and political problems that\r\nled to the dispute in the first place.\r\nWe welcome the positive developments in the role of\r\nthe Security Council and its ability to perform the role\r\nmandated to it by the Charter, thanks to the new spirit of\r\ncooperation that emerged between its members and enabled\r\nit to take collective measures in respect of some very\r\ndifficult and sensitive issues and to assume new\r\nresponsibilities such as the expansion of its authority in\r\nrespect of some peace-keeping issues through the\r\nadministration of some areas during periods of transition\r\nand through the supervision of elections and the protection\r\nof human rights. None the less, we have some fears that\r\nthe Council may become an institution that is used to\r\nimpose the will of the strong on the weak.\r\nTherefore, we believe that the exercise by certain\r\nmembers of particular rights and privileges must not lead\r\nto hegemony by a limited number of strong States over\r\nthe course of events in the world. Thus we believe that\r\nthe question of membership of the Security Council must\r\nbe dealt with in a manner that takes into account the large\r\nincrease in the membership of the United Nations while\r\nputting some checks on the use of the right of veto.\r\nIn addition, the international community must respect\r\nthe resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil. Political will must be mobilized to implement\r\nthose resolutions, to impose peace if conditions so\r\nrequire, or to negotiate peace if there is good faith and if\r\nthe parties cooperate. We believe that this is the\r\nguaranteed means of protecting the new international\r\norder and of ensuring its acceptability, credibility and\r\nstability.\r\nWe hope that the celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations will mark the rebirth of\r\na new, stronger and more democratic body. In this\r\nregard, we are encouraged by discussions, within and\r\noutside the United Nations, regarding the restructuring of\r\nthe Organization and its various organs. These are very\r\nconstructive, serious and objective discussions, and all the\r\nStates of the world are participating in them.\r\nThe State of Qatar, proceeding from the wise\r\ninstructions of the Emir, His Royal Highness Sheikh\r\nKhalifa Bin Hamad Al-Thani, and his loyal heir, His\r\nRoyal Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, has\r\nalways participated by all means in the solution of issues\r\nrelated to the Arab Gulf, as well as the Arab and Islamic\r\nnation. We have supported the Gulf Cooperation Council\r\nbecause it serves the interests of the Gulf States and their\r\npeoples. We, as part of the region, believe that our\r\nsecurity is closely linked to the region’s. We have\r\nsupported stability in the region and rejected every\r\nattempt to bring about regional changes by force. We\r\nbelieve that the security of the region requires cooperation\r\namongst all its States on the basis of good-\r\nneighbourliness, mutual respect, non-intervention in\r\ninternal affairs and respect for international law. We hold\r\nthat all unresolved problems should be resolved by\r\npeaceful means, through dialogue, mediation or the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nProceeding from this principle, the State of Qatar\r\nsupports the resolution by such means of the current dispute\r\nbetween the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran over the three islands of Abu Moussa and the two\r\nTumbs.\r\nOn the Arab level, the State of Qatar has continually\r\ncalled for the airing of issues in the Arab world and for\r\nreconciliation, in order to promote Arab solidarity so that\r\nthe Arab Umma may resume its role in history and in the\r\nmarch of civilization.\r\nWe have followed with the greatest concern the\r\nregrettable events in the Republic of Yemen. Since the\r\ndispute began, the State of Qatar has participated in\r\ndiplomatic efforts to contain it. Despite the bloody and\r\nregrettable struggle, friendly Yemen has maintained its\r\nunity. As you know, from the beginning we have stood on\r\nthe side of legality and unity in Yemen, and we have been\r\neager to abide by these two principles in dealing with the\r\nissue, proceeding from our faith in the need to maintain the\r\nunity of the Yemenite territory and people.\r\nAs for the situation in Iraq, our position is that the\r\nunity of Iraq and its territorial integrity must be maintained.\r\nIraq must commit itself to the implementation of all\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. It must recognize the\r\nsovereignty of the state of Kuwait and its territorial\r\nintegrity, as well as its internationally recognized border\r\naccording to United Nations Security Council resolutions.\r\nWe also sympathize with the Iraqi people and call for the\r\nalleviation of their hardship, taking into account the acute\r\nshortage of medicines and foodstuffs.\r\nConcerning peace in the Middle East, we support the\r\nprocess and hope that negotiations will achieve concrete\r\nprogress on all tracks, particularly concerning Lebanon and\r\nSyria. Last year, we welcomed the Palestinian-Israeli\r\nagreement as a landmark on the road to a just solution to\r\nthe Palestinian question. We now welcome the subsequent\r\nsteps taken, namely the early transfer of authority and the\r\nexpansion of self-rule, both of which are important steps\r\ntowards the achievement of a just and comprehensive\r\nsolution to the question of Palestine. We also welcome the\r\nJordanian-Israeli declaration as to the ending of the state of\r\nwar between the two countries and the initiation of serious\r\nnegotiations to resolve all problems, specifically those\r\nconcerning water and borders. This declaration is also a\r\nlandmark on the road towards a just and comprehensive\r\nsolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, on the basis of the\r\nMadrid formula; Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\r\nand 338 (1973); the land-for-peace principle; the full\r\nwithdrawal of Israeli troops from all occupied territories\r\n(the Golan Heights, the southern part of Lebanon,\r\nJerusalem); the restoration of all inalienable rights of the\r\nPalestinian people, including the right to self-\r\ndetermination; and the creation of a State whose capital\r\nwill be Jerusalem, as it is a symbol of peace and is part\r\nand parcel of the territories occupied since 1967. During\r\nthe transitional period, the situation in this territory,\r\nparticularly its demographic aspects, should not be\r\nchanged. I wish here to reiterate the need to put a stop\r\nto the process of Israeli settlement, which is illegal and\r\nconstitutes a major hurdle in the way of peace.\r\nProceeding from this, the General Assembly should\r\nreaffirm, at its current session, all previous resolutions\r\nregarding the question of Palestine and the Middle East\r\nproblem, and declare them unalienable.\r\nIn order to push ahead the peace process in the\r\nMiddle East, we participated in the multilateral\r\nnegotiations. We indicated that those negotiations did not\r\nreplace bilateral negotiations but complemented them, and\r\nthat they would lead to nothing unless a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace was achieved in the region. In this\r\nregard, the State of Qatar hosted, from 2 to 5 May 1994,\r\nthe fifth meeting of the Working Group on Disarmament\r\nand Regional Security in the Middle East, which\r\ndeveloped from the multilateral negotiations.\r\nThe position of Qatar was stated as follows. First,\r\nsupport for all international efforts aimed at achieving\r\nagreement on disarmament on the regional and\r\ninternational levels, and support for the efforts of the\r\nDisarmament Conference in this respect. Second, the\r\narrangements of arms control after the achievement of\r\npeace should be based on legally binding and co-equal\r\ncommitments by all parties under international law and in\r\nconformity with the United Nations Charter. Third, arms\r\ncontrol efforts on the international level have achieved\r\nremarkable success, particularly between the Russian\r\nFederation and the United States as indicated by the\r\nsigning of START and all subsequent steps. Yet those\r\nefforts have not achieved any tangible progress in the\r\nMiddle East, since one State continues to retain its\r\nnuclear capabilities. Fourth, all States are called upon to\r\naccede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and to agree\r\nto abide by its safeguards and subject their nuclear\r\nfacilities to international inspections. The region must be\r\nfreed from all weapons of mass destruction and their\r\ndelivery systems. In this regard, we wonder how the\r\nGeneral Conference of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency could decide to resume its technical assistance to\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nIsrael, while Israel continues to reject the NPT and refuses\r\nto submit to its safeguards regime.\r\nWe follow with great concern the situation in brotherly\r\nSomalia. We hope that national reconciliation will\r\nsafeguard the unity, independence and stability of Somalia.\r\nOn this occasion, we wish to support the decision by the\r\nArab Foreign Ministers to set up an Arab ministerial\r\ncommittee that would monitor the situation in Somalia and\r\nwork towards the desired reconciliation alongside the\r\nSecretary-General of the League of Arab States.\r\nAs for Afghanistan, we express our concern over the\r\ncontinuing violence and call upon all factions to halt\r\nhostilities and work for a permanent and peaceful\r\nsettlement that would give precedence to the interests of the\r\nAfghani people.\r\nSince the Second World War, Europe has not\r\nwitnessed a tragedy such as that which is unfolding in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The suffering imposed on the\r\nMuslim people through the atrocities of ethnic cleansing,\r\ngenocide and mass killings at the hands of Serb aggressors\r\nconstitute crimes which far exceed all those committed in\r\nEurope in the course of the Second World War. Despite\r\nthe fact that the Serbs reject the international peace plan\r\ndrawn up by the five States and accepted by Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, no disciplinary action has been taken against\r\nthe Serb aggressors, while the embargoes are still in place\r\nagainst Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the very least, the\r\ninternational community should enable the Muslims to\r\nexercise the right of self-defence, a legitimate right\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. Once again,\r\ntogether with other members of the Islamic world we ask,\r\nwhy is it that there is all this procrastination in dealing with\r\nthe Serbs, and why are they allowed to hold on to the land\r\nthey have acquired by force and on which they continue to\r\npractice the atrocities of ethnic cleansing? The international\r\ncommunity is called upon to deal with this matter firmly\r\nwith no double standards and in a manner that would\r\nguarantee the independence and territorial integrity of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and guarantee for it an economic\r\nsituation that may enable it to survive. This would\r\ncertainly contribute to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security in that sensitive region of the world.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe State of Qatar reiterates its condemnation of this\r\naggression and reaffirms the independence of the Republic\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, its territorial integrity, its\r\nsovereignty and its unity with and its one indivisible\r\ncapital, Sarajevo.\r\nWhile we welcomed the resolution adopted by the\r\nUnited States Congress and agreed to by the\r\nAdministration to lift the embargo against the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, we have been surprised by the\r\nlatest resolution by the Security Council, which included\r\na relaxation of the sanctions imposed on Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, the State that stands beside the Serbian\r\nmilitias in their continuing aggression against the Muslims\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believe that the said\r\nresolution will have grave consequences as it rewards the\r\naggressor and the forces that support that aggression and\r\nconstitutes a retreat in the face of aggression, massacres\r\nand continuing ethnic crimes.\r\nIn this regard, we call on the Security Council not to\r\nreward aggression. We call upon it to discharge its\r\nresponsibilities towards the protection of the Muslims in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina by declaring the entire Republic\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina a safe haven. The Council\r\nmust ensure that no military assistance is allowed to reach\r\nthe Serbs. The Muslims must be enabled to exercise their\r\nlegitimate right to self-defence by the lifting of the\r\nembargo on their country. Once again, we emphasize that\r\nthe war criminals in the former Yugoslavia must be\r\nbrought to justice and support the demand by the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) contact\r\ngroup on Bosnia and Herzegovina to be allowed to\r\nparticipate in all activities of the contact group of five.\r\nThe world economy is slowly emerging from the\r\nstate of stagnation which has lasted for far too long. A\r\nnew period of varying degrees of growth has started,\r\nparticularly in the third world. Numerous elements had\r\ncontributed to that situation. Foremost among those\r\nelements was the burden of foreign debt which is being\r\naggravated by the deterioration in prices of basic export\r\ncommodities side by side with the paucity of foreign\r\ninvestments in the areas of production and the very high\r\nexpenditures on armaments. The time has come for the\r\ninternational community, in particular the developed\r\nindustrial States, to adopt effective measures that would\r\nmake it possible to devise a definitive solution to the\r\nproblems of indebtedness in the third world as a whole,\r\nand in Africa in particular.\r\nThe debt burden in Africa has had many grave\r\nconsequences which have affected the ability of the\r\ncontinent to grow and develop. Despite the many debt\r\nrescheduling agreements concluded over the past few\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nForty-ninth session 28 September 1994\r\nyears, the servicing of debt continues to consume over\r\n22 per cent of all export earnings and continues to obstruct\r\ninvestment and human development.\r\nIn this context, the dialogue between the North and the\r\nSouth should be reactivated in a more effective manner in\r\norder to find new means to achieve development in the\r\nthird world and to rid the third world of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. We believe that ridding the world of\r\npoverty and underdevelopment is an essential prerequisite\r\nof lasting peace and the welfare of mankind.\r\nUndoubtedly, success in the dialogue between North\r\nand South and productive cooperation between them will\r\npromote efforts to reach a new more realistic and more\r\nbalanced international economic order. The development\r\nof the South is not merely in the interests of its States and\r\npeoples alone, it is also in the interests of the North and its\r\npeople.\r\nThe developing world pins its hopes on international\r\ntrade as a means of achieving prosperity for all. We\r\ntherefore welcomed the recent success achieved with regard\r\nto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)\r\nand hope that this success will result in the freeing of trade\r\nand of unrestricted competition in the world.\r\nThe threats facing mankind today, and which will\r\ncontinue to face it in future, are not all political or military.\r\nThere are questions of the deterioration of the environment,\r\npoverty, underdevelopment, drugs, the spread of life-\r\nthreatening diseases, terrorism and violations of human\r\nrights which become more grave with each passing day.\r\nThese non-political issues require urgent solutions before\r\nthey become intractable and threaten all mankind.\r\nAmong the indications of the international\r\ncommunity’s concern with economic and social issues is\r\nthe large number of international conferences devoted to\r\nsuch issues. Over the past two years, the world witnessed\r\nthe holding of several such conferences, including the\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development in\r\nRio de Janeiro, and next year the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment will be held in Copenhagen. Each one of the\r\nconferences that have been convened has achieved results\r\nwith regard to the issues it has dealt with by means of\r\nresolutions and recommendations and the international\r\nconsensus surrounding those resolutions and\r\nrecommendations.\r\nAll we wish for here is that those issues should not\r\nbe used as a pretext to intervene in the internal affairs of\r\nStates, to deal with States in a discriminatory manner, or\r\nto impose conditions on providing economic or\r\ndevelopmental aid.\r\nI refer in this connection to the idea of a carbon tax,\r\nwhether individual or collective, under the pretext of\r\nprotecting the environment. This is purely an economic\r\nissue which will harm the economies of oil-producing\r\nStates, particularly those in the Gulf.\r\nThe State of Qatar reaffirms its support for the\r\nUnited Nations efforts to deal with the issues I have\r\nmentioned. The United Nations is the ideal institution to\r\nface up to international and world issues with all their\r\npolitical, humanitarian, economic and social dimensions.\r\nInspired by the Charter, it can achieve success by\r\nbuilding a world based on relations of cooperation and\r\nmutual confidence, a world of justice and stability.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.45 p.m.\r\n38\r\n"
